<text>First time visit. This store is phenomenal. Due to covid restrictions we had a little bit of a wait, which I normally wouldn't do, but I'd heard good things about the place from friends. They have an amazing selection (cheese, salami, beer, wine, etc.) despite being a relatively small space. I came for one thing, which unfortunately they didn't have at the moment due to import shortages (not their fault), but I left with a plethora of goodies. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town.<//text>< response>

Holy cow! What an amazing shop! We landed and were crazy hungry. So we did exactly what you shouldn't do and went in hungry. They have a great selection of wines that run across all varieties. Their cheese and meats are equally varied and wonderful. Best of all, the entire staff knows their products backwards and forwards. We ordered two sandwiches to go. Had we known that each one has roughly the dimensions of a skateboard, we probably could've split one. No matter though—it was delicious.< /review>

What an amazing placed filled with amazing people! We were just in Palm Springs for a week, and we entertained friends at our home multiple times throughout our stay there, and On the Mark was our reliable source for everything but mostly their beautiful charcuterie spreads. They are kind, helpful, knowledgable, and their ingredients are so fresh that we returned 4 of our 7 nights for dinner ingredients, etc. This is exactly what our little city needed, and they were so sweet to accommodate us with a one hour notice for a spread. I can't recommend this place more, and look forward to hosting more of their goodies!<//Text>

I needed a gift basket for some friends vacationing in Palm Springs. Ryan worked on putting together the perfect basket for us. He paired wines, cheeses, meats and so much more. He was a great help and truly went above and beyond making sure it got delivered to the right house. Which was a challenge to find.</text>

<text>A lovely little store of unusual finds and goodies right in downtown  Palm Springs. We were welcomed heartily and given plenty of time and space to explore their store. We've heard from friends that their hand-crafted sandwiches and such are outstanding, but will have to try them another time. Keep in mind, with special items that are often hard to find there are also some rather 'salty' prices. A fun place to explore and you may find that unique addition to your epicurean delights!<//text>< gmapID>

Incredible hole on the wall here. Their catering is incredible but also come in to grab a delicious sandwich and try various very delicious cheeses, spread, mustards etc.

ALSO: TRY THEIR EXOTIC CHOCALATES!! Batch specific, curated chocolates... unbelievable

Their sandwiches use bread baked that am which really compliment the extreme quality ingredients they use to build your sandwich. I had the Wisconsin on fresh baked, moist sour dough with amazing carmelized dark crust... must try, the cheese and meats are out of this world!
As far as catering goes, the presentation is on a board that shows extremely well and of course the foods are on a completely nother level... TRY IT!</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Great place for gifts of a foodie nature. The new store is full of little discoveries. We bought two sandwiches for our flight home. $12.95 for a sandwich and salad or chips. The sandwiches had Grade A ingredients were tasty and in typical American style, huge, not necessarily in size but in filling ingredients. I would say for those who have a light appetite, share a sandwich. Service is great, staff are very helpful. I saw some beautiful charcuterie boards in the fridge. This is just a great place. Well done!</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Been following these guys on the Gram for a while, and finally swung by for a visit today. There were lots of nice cheeses we havent tried (bought a few for when we go back to LA tomorrow) and some meats, along with some other jarred delicacies. We ended up getting some sandwiches for dinner—the Italian meats one and the turkey (cant remember the names). They were OUTSTANDING! Generous and delicious! *Big plus* was having gluten free bread that held together when I bit into the sandwich and tasted like non-gf bread. What a find! Ate it too fast to take pictures, unfortunately! lol! Friendly, knowledgeable staff, too. This is definitely on our “regular eats” list when we come for our visits. Thank you!! See you soon!< /Review>

Cutest little shop with great selection of wines and cheeses. The owner is so amiable and helpful. Deli on site where they will help create a lovely, delicious picnic or cheese board.<//Review>

<text>Love this place have been going for the last three years on our visit to Palm Springs we had a hard time finding it this year as it moved hope Google update there map so you can find it it's actually on museum way and not on the main strip even though the address suggest that sandwiches and salads are excellent as well<//text>< UserId.>

<Review>On The Mark is awesome! This is my go to spot for a quick lunch to go on a busy work day. Aside from having great sandwiches, just about everything they have is phenomenal. Check it out for lunch, and try some samples. You'll fall in love. Great people running the place to! Enjoy!</Review>< GmapID>

Went to On the Mark to purchase cheese for our holiday cheese tray, ended up letting them build the tray. It was fantastic. We'll be back! Great service and reasonable prices.< /review>

Always new delicious things to sample, many things not available anywhere else in the desert. The gourmet cheese platters and deli sandwiches are incredible.  Don't drive by, give it a try.

After some research I heard Avrrus was one of the most affordable and highest quality TV installation companies in town. Marlin picked the phone right up when I called and was able to come the day after I called. He suggested the proper mounting hardware which I had ready to go when he arrive. Within 45 minutes he was done with the installation. He went above and beyond to make sure all of my devices and wires were nice and hidden behind the TV & he cleaned up any mess that was made from installing the mount (I'm an OCD clean freak so this part was fantastic).

Job Description: TV Mount Installation, Sound Bar Mount to TV, Floating shelf installation (all were leveled perfectly).

Marlon did a fantastic job mounting our TV and installing our sound system. He went the extra mile to shore up some shoddy work done by our previous handyman when mounting our old TV. He stayed late to ensure we were well taken care of and were completely satisfied with the finished product. The pricing was reasonable and he was able to schedule with us shortly after contacting him. We would highly recommend him for any future TV mounting needs. Impeccable work with over 24 years experience!< /review>

Hired Marlin from Avrrus to mount our new 65" TV. Contacted him on Sunday for a quote and he got in touch with us quickly. Great price and great service, took less than an hour. Would definitely recommend and we will for sure be contacting him for any future mounting services.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>First, I'd like to say that I am in no way being paid or persuaded into giving this review. This is an honest review of the work I requested.

I cannot express enough how happy I am with the professional service I received from Mr. Marlin at Avvrus. During the course of a tiring move Avrrus came through for the WIN! I requested to have TVs taken down and remounted with two add-ons. I also had furniture that needed to be disassembled and moved. Not only did Mr. Marlin come through and dismount my TVs he extended his services to disassemble my furniture AND haul it to my new residence! Now, how awesome is that?!

I am HUGE on customer service and professionalism and Mr. Marlin blew me away. He went above and beyond and I am ever grateful. I definitely refer his services for whatever you need. He explained everything he was doing as well as extended for us to call should we have ANY questions. If you are looking for quality, PROFESSIONAL work please call Avvrus.

I will definitely be using his services for new installations and recommend him to ANYONE requiring top knotch work. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>< Pictures>

Avrrus a top quality custom install specialist. I didn't think my 82 inch Samsung could be mounted in the space that was provided in my living room and he did a remarkable job of fabricating the custom support for my mount,and the company is insured so I felt very comfortable with the whole process .< /review>

Highly skilled and very professional! I asked several companies in the Vegas Valley to install my TV above my fireplace and they wouldn’t or couldn’t do it. AVRRUS had it installed and running in a couple of hours. It looks awesome!!!! I would definitely recommend AVRRUS for all of my TV mounting and installation needs.</review>

<text>Marlin came to our home on  separate occasions to hookup and place several tv’s; install a subwoofer and mount our 65” tv in the center of the cabinet. From the start he was on time;  wry professional; knew his craft with all needed parts and materials in hand. He was recommended to me by the company that I purchased the tv’s from.  He was very thorough in his work, left no debris and takes pride in the quality of his work. I have asked him to give me a bid on landscaping lights.
I would recommend him for same and other electrical jobs based on his skill sets along with kudos for his attention to details.

<username>Mike Garcia</username><Date>1601168125646</Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>From the 1st call Avrrus TV was on point. I described what needed to be done including sending pics of outlets that needing relocation and where the TV's where to be mounted.

I worked with Marlin the owner of the company and he was very detailed in figuring out exactly what we wanted and how he was going to execute.

The company showed up on time, walked them through the house and they went to work. Avrrus was efficient, kept things clean and most of all their attention to detail was priority. 4 TVs and a outlet relocation later we walked through the house, they tested all the TV's made sure we were aware of everything they were did.

I have used a few companies around the valley on several houses, Avrrus was 100% professional and the communication made it a pain free experience with absolutely no stress. It is very rare to find this kind of service with this quality and level of efficiency.

Contacted Avrrus to get a quote to mount my tv and add an elevated power plug and coaxial outlet. Marlin at Avrrus provided a fair price and offered a quick appointment time. He was on time. Wore masks and gloves (COVID) and was friendly. My house was built in 1978 so adding a wall outlet isn’t as straightforward as news house because of stud placement. Marlin identified this early on and was able to provide a good solution while honoring the price he quoted me. Never tried to upsell me. Work was well done , everything was straight and he cleaned up after himself. Happy with his work.<//Text>

<Review>Marvin took his time to explain the service, he offered suggestions on placement and provided details of the equipment needed, used and required.  He cleaned up when the job was completed ad was very pleasant.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1598890171669, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing Avrrus'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b90e49889953:0x4a4f6d70567af3a2<//Gmap_id>< Rating>

Hands down, the best service I have ever received. I recently relocated to Las Vegas due to a military move and the owner ensured all my needs were taken care of. His prices are more affordable than the competition and in my personal opinion, the service is even better. Would highly recommend his services to the Las Vegas community along with any military service member moving to Las Vegas.< /text>

<Review>I tried to mount my tv’s on my own because I’ve always been determined to be a handy woman, but I ended up drilling too many holes in my walls trying to find a secure spot. I contacted Avrrus, this place has a fast response on calling back and I got same day service. My service guy was Marlin, he was great and quick. And he was nice enough to plaster up the holes I made on my walls without me asking. Thanks Marlin, good job!</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Don’t trust these people!!! I left the room due to the dust and had new black curtains in the pack that I planned on installing after the tv was done. When the man left I never found my curtains anywhere!!!I didn’t want to think it was him, but after searching everywhere and no one else has been to my house they didn’t just disappear!!! I ended up having to buy a whole new pack an no stores had black so I had to change the color. Don’t leave them alone I have fully lost trust in people after this!!!!!</review>< pics>

He has skills not just in installation of televisions. Thank you Marlin for being a professional. He finished the work and cleaned up after himself.

< Review>
Avvrus services were exceptional. He was professional and knowledgeable of all things asked of him. He mounted 3 TVs. Each TV had a different mount. He assembled and put up the TVs with a flat mount, tilt mount, and articulating mount. He made sure each one was balanced and safely mounted. I had no worries after he was finished and was extremely happy with his services. I would hire him again if I had more TVs. He also cleaned up any shavings, dirt or drywall mess before packing everything up. You will  feel extremely safe and worry free with his services.<//Review>

We recently purchased a house and needed someone that could mount several TVs. We chose Marlin because he was readily available, his estimate was reasonable and his reviews were very good.
Marlin arrived on time and ready to work. He was extremely well mannered and pleasant to work with even when he ran into a couple of issues. The issues were resolved, the TVs were mounted, he cleaned up the work areas and the job is completed.
But Marlin was not finish. The house we purchased is very high-tech it even has a “very scary” A/V (Audio/Video) closet. We are NOT Techie People!! Marlin was very knowledgeable about EVERY scary thing in that closet!!!
He provided recommendations and a plan to make our lives easier by utilizing that , no longer “scary”, but “smart” closet.
Marlin will definitely be back soon for part 2 of our Project List.
THANKS Marlin

Marlin did an excellent job installing our flat screen tv, cable, DVD and stereo equipment.  He was very knowledgeable and prepared with everything we needed to get the job done. I would use him again for our next project!<//Text>

Avrrus is a professional perfectionist . He spent a great deal of time patiently teaching us about our new LG OLED 65" TV. He is knowledgeable, personable, responsive & fairly priced. I highly recommend this young man over any other.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Marlin is absolutely amazing, and that alone is an understatement. We live out in Riverside County, and he drove from LA to be here to mount our large 86 inch TV. Professional, knowledgeable, courteous, and kind are what I would tell someone if they asked me what I thought about him. He absolutely knows what he is doing, and if you need someone to install your tv, look no further. The end result will be a beautifully mounted entertainment system with a stress free pleasant installation process. 5 stars without a doubt</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1553907726178, 'text': 'Thank you so much'}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b90e49889953:0x4a4f6d70567af3a2</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I live in the Las Vegas area, and I must admit when I stumbled across this ad, I called to see how expensive it was to have my tv mounted to the wall, and was overwhelmed by the decent price...
highly recommend this company and the technician, I will be sending business your way< /Text>

He definitely knows what he’s doing and knows how to trouble shoot any problem. We had to change out our DVR box after he left and then we ran into connectivity problems. He FaceTimed us and walk us through getting it reconnected correctly. We will use him again and recommend him for any home entertainment installation.<//Review>< Response>

Our sewer line was draining slow, especially when using the washer. Their tech stayed with the situation until it cleared. Their rates were definately within reason and the service tech made certain that we knew and approved everything he did. I would definately use them again.< /Review>

The house was reaching 90 degrees and with the weather being over 110 degrees we needed someone quick. We called Cardinal and they were over within an hour. We have an older house so things tend to be out of date and not up to today’s needs. Dan explained What the problem was and what we needed for everything to work properly and quickly fixed us up. He was friendly, professional and fast. We are very grateful to Dan and Cardinal Plumbing for taking care of our problem so quickly!<//Review>< Name>

Once again I stuffed up the kitchen drain. No big deal except no washer. No dish washer and no workshop sink. Think I’d learn. At least it wasn’t Thanksgiving morning. Came the same day very friendly no lecture on my repeat performance and a senior discount. Thanks Cardinal< /Text>

We needed an old water heater replaced in our home and Cardinal was able to schedule us in very quickly to get the job done! The man that came out was respectful, courteous, and efficient. He cleaned up when the job was done and even hauled our old water heater away for us! 10/10 we will definitely be using Cardinal again!</review>

I had a stubborn hair ball stopping up the shower that didn't respond to 2 bottles of Draino, numerous attempts with a plunger, and a hair removing hook. After struggling with it for the better part of a week, I called Cardinal. They squeezed me in at the end of the day on a Friday.  When it appeared they may be later than originally estimated, they called back to make sure I knew and was OK with it.  Not wanting to deal with ankle deep water over the weekend, I was willing to wait. They arrived within 10 minutes of the original timeframe.  I had gotten an estimate over the phone so I knew approximately what to expect. When the tech came, he got right to work and retrieved the hairball that had eluded all my attempts. He was in and out in 15 minutes or less, cleaned up the area where he worked and didnt charge me as much as I was expecting.  It was a relief to have the shower fixed and it wasnt a fortune.  I will definately use Cardinal again.<//text>

<text>We recently had our water heater replaced and were lucky enough to have been referred to Cardinal. Jose did an amazing job with the removal and installation, despite the small working space. He was so professional, knowledgeable, and had our water heater up and running in no time. No more cold showers :). We appreciate all of the hard work and excellent customer service provided. We will definitely share our experience with friends & family. Thank you!!< /text>< pics>

We've used Cardinal Plumbing several times. They've always been punctual, done quality work,  and very responsive to our questions.  They weren't out to make the almighty dollar.  In fact this time the plumber told us no need to spend the money and wait. Great service.</review>

We live about 20 mins from RC, but our plumber arrived very close to the appointment time. Got right to work after my confirming what the work order said. We knew the job (actually three) was difficult but not only did he finish quicker than we had anticipated, but tested everything, cleaned up, and disposed of all the old parts. Professional, respectful, and personable. The bill was actually much less than we expected, too. Highly recommend Cardinal Plumbing.</review>

I just need to give Cardinal Plumbing a shout out. My 93 year old grandmother had a sprinkler leak on a Sunday. I tried to help and made it worse so it was really pouring water. We called the city and had to leave a message. So we called Cardinal Plumbing and the guy said he'd drive out to turn off the water for no charge. (Cost was a concern for my grandma on a fixed income.) The city ended up showing up before he could get there but I was still so impressed that he was willing to do that for us. This must be a real honest, stand up company!<//Text>

The work involved 2 toilets and a tub, with one of the toilets being a rocker.
The toilet had been replaced and worked on several times the past few years, but no one had actually fixed it. Cardinal Plumbing did get it fixed, going the extra mile of adding fast drying cement to get the ring and flange to sit properly and attach properly to the toilet. Because the floor is uneven, he used additional supplies that he cut to fit that took care of the last of the in-balance.
For the first time in years, the toilet is properly fixed, it no longer rocks, and there is no leaking. The other 2 items were small issues, that he also fixed quickly and thoroughly.
The workman that came out was knowledgeable, fast but thorough, and very professional. Based on the work he did, with the skill he displayed, I will return to Cardinal Plumbing for all future plumbing needs.</Text>

Jeff from Cardinal came this morning and put in a new water heater for us. He was right on time and supplied extra parts we needed. he was friendly and fast. He explained the process as he went along as he had to reroute pipes. It was a total of 178 that included a senior discount. We give them an A and would call them again if ever needed.< /text>

I’ve had three experiences with Cardinal Plumbing over the past two months. Each time it was Danny that came out. First visit he correctly diagnosed a bad “tankless” water heater. Second visit he installed a new one, and the whole thing took less than an hour. This last visit to our house he fixed the water heater, it was making a weird noise.
The long/short of it is Cardinal Plumbing is a top-notch outfit and I HIGHY recommend Danny. Great job guys 👍🏻< /Text>

They sold me a water heater for a THOUSAND dollars, and it stop working within the 1st year. I called they came out and fixed it. After a while the water heater would go out 2 to 4 times a year, so they started charging me a90 dollar fee, never resolved the issue.

I needed a plumber to fix a bursted pipe in the front of my house, and they told me they can't service my address. It's NOT  my fault their product doesn't work.</text>

I’ve had three experiences with Cardinal Plumbing over the past two months. Each time it was Danny that came out. First visit he correctly diagnosed a bad “tankless” water heater. Second visit he installed a new one, and the whole thing took less than an hour. This last visit to our house he fixed the water heater, it was making a weird noise.
The long/short of it is Cardinal Plumbing is a top-notch outfit and I HIGHY recommend Danny. Great job guys 👍🏻< /review>

<review>🌻🌞🌷
We have been using Cardinal Plumbing for a couple of decades. My Preferred Plumbing Company, quick response good service and friendly Folk😀
Recently they have been helping me clear the crud from my rust filled lines, a result of our recent earthquake and loss of my well tank☇
Most of my recent experience involves replacing valves that I can't deal with, a new water heater, a new dishwasher and other things of importance.
They also helped me deal with my septic system😁
BTW: Thank you Andrew😇

<text>Well over the years we have had underground water leaks and these folks have always been professional and worked with the insurance co. .. This time however we needed a hot water heater installed and I messed up the appt date, my husband had already disconnected the electrical to it.
I had called to ask them a couple of questions and she said you know the appt. is not until 2 days. My first thought was I'am not taking a cold shower, she said that is okay we will take care of it today and it was my fault about getting the date mixed up! The point is with my experience these people try their very best not to leave you without the basics(hot water) they go above and beyond, and are very professional and pleasant to deal with!! Thank You Cardinal Plumbing.<//text>< date>

<text>Menudo is delicious and it comes with harmony. I never get pata so idk if pata is an option here. There is also a variety of pan dulce, the ones I have ate were good. They also sell avena (oatmeal) and mini burritos (2 per serving) with chili verde, chicharron, chorizo or a couple of other meats. This is a good little bakery.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO529XmvcGhFrNyE9VEhMS0Kaj7yvTLseTajCXc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOF8k0d2Bf7hLwTVbf4t71KuRLBjnD038cfDbz6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNxLRkz3frYknjzEnuFBx8V01i-8MawHwZ1ps3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkIc65nzrIFiGkHHpzQWqZwA5OFE3ZCWVSjx7X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80e84dc8d93d7ed1:0xd849eb84d715e123</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Some of the best Pan Dulce on the planet. The Champurrada was also out of this world.<//Review>

<Text>The tamales are very delicious 😋😋😋, fresh and very mouthwatering 🤤🤤🤤 if anyone wishes too buy tamales on a regular business you can actually call ahead a placed a order for pick up 'BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO WISH BUY TAMALES: ADVICE FOR YOU ALL YOU CAN CALL A ORDER FOR PICK-UP, BUT... BE SURE TO CALL A DAY EARLY *LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN PLACED THE ORDER ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND THEN TELL THE EMPLOYEE HOW MANY YOU WISH TO ORDER AND THEN THE EMPLOYEE WILL ASK YOU WHAT TIME TO WISH TOO PICK THEM UP I RECOMMEND NO LATER THAN 9AM AND THEN YOU PICK IT UP ON THE NEXT DAY WHICH IS SATURDAY, IMPORTANT NOTE BE SURE TOO FOLLOW THE EMPLOYEE INSTRUCTIONS AND LISTEN TOO THE EMPLOYEE VERY CAREFULLY WHILE PLACING THE ORDER; ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE BE PATIENCE AND  COURTEOUS WITH THE EMPLOYEES AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE OTHER CUSTOMERS IN LINE, ESPECIALLY WAY MORE DURING THE PANDEMIC SITUATION!!!!!< /Text>< Date>

Went in for the Tamales.  They raised the price. Just wish they would add more meat. But they taste good.  Baked pastries look good.<//text>

The tamales are the top sellers I think, they always run out. Right amount of meat/masa ratio and always hot. I did try the chorizo,bean,cheese and potato burrito and it was good but it needed more chorizo, you could see it you just couldn't taste it. The staff is always polite, the place is always clean and there's usually a line so be patient. They do require a mask to enter and only 3 people at a time allowed inside.<//Text></record>

I was very disappointed by the customer service, the lady ignored my questions and was very dismissive, the champurrado tastes like water with sugar. This is not champurrado.<//text>

I've been there twice now and would say their pan dulce is good enough to come back. I've gone late at night after work so not much of a selection by then, but the conchas were soft and you could taste the trigo(not just regular white bread with sugar on top). Soft each time i've gone and stays soft a few days.< /text>

Great tamales, fresh bread, burritos .... etc, etc. A little pricey on the bread, but quality & service are priceless. I load up on everything I can when traveling in the USA to visit friends. I enjoy cooking for my friends and this place provides the authentic Mexican Culinary experience with their products. This is Not 'as close as it gets to the authentic food', This IS the real deal. Nowhere else, in the region, could we find these products.
Buen provecho. - FDA<//Text>

<Text>With an interest in buying a high end e bike ..and money in my pocket I drove 30 minutes to get there. They had me wait outside a while and asked me what I wanted even before stepping in the store, once in no one bothered to come up and help while I was looking for 15 minutes, they carried on with their conversation with each other. ( they did have ebikes for sale)
I felt I was imposing.. as a small business owner myself in the past I would never do business with such a place.
I went to Holland bicycles in Coronado and had a fantastic experience and they got my business.< /Text></record>

<user>113761718202977492114< /user><Review>I'm sorry to hear about the poor reviews. This location is in Banker's Hill with off street metered parking. It speaks volumes that this business has been sustained through these unique circumstances. Service was positive, bike tuned up, and pleasant conversation during the wait. There could be a wait from 0-20 minutes. It's best to go on the weekday.</Review>< rating>

Above standard customer service! Amazing stuff, it does not matter who you run into, all the guys are very helpful. I have stopped by a couple of times. They helped me with flat tires and adjusted my breaks. When I need any help again, it is definitely a place to go!</Review>

<Text>I've tried a few different bike shops around time, and this has become my go to spot. Everyone there has been very knowledgeable and friendly. On my most recent visit, I went in to purchase a new crank set as well as a new cassette as I was throwing my chain a little more often than normal. Instead of just selling what I asked for, they ordered me a new crank set, and did some chain adjustments to resolve the issue, stating in the notes that my cassette didn't need replacement.

As a novice cyclist, I really appreciate the honesty and integrity of the shop. They could have easily just sold me what I requested instead of what I needed, and I wouldn't have been mad at them since I didn't ask for any advice, but instead, they took it upon themselves to only do the necessary!< /Text><response>None< /response>< rate>

<name>Wayne Jackson< /name><Date>1600894157014< /Date><Rate>5</Rate><Text>I have a 3 year old Trek Crossrip 2. Great bike. I am pretty much a city rider averaging 60 miles a week. I dropped my bike off at Bankers Hill - Uptown Bicycles Sunday afternoon with a long list of tasks and repairs.  Chris told me it would be ready on Tuesday and that he would call me early Tuesday with a progress report. I have to confess, I didn’t really believe him. However, Chris did call early Tuesday, and my bike was actually ready Tuesday afternoon. I was Impressed!
When I took my bike for a test spin, it was as if I was riding a new bike! Chris repaired everything I had asked for and also fixed many minor issues I didn’t mention. His care and customer service from beginning to end was exceptional.
P.S. Uptown Bicycles – Today customer service is everything! Please provide lots of time off for Chris to rest and recharge. His superior level of customer service is probably rarely appreciated by most customers.

Thank you Chris F. and Uptown Bicycles Bankers Hill!
Sincerely,

<Text>I love this place.  Prices are surprisingly close to online, obviously they will not compete with online but the level of service more than makes up for it.  They are just upbeat and cheerful folks that make me wish I had more money to spend here.  Very knowledgeable and they dont make you feel dumb cause you asked a silly question or push you into something that you didnt need.  Keep up the great work!</Text><Time>1601087299527< /Time>< user>

I am not local, but Uptown Bicycles provides quick shipping.  I needed some components, and Uptown had great prices.  I like browsing their website almost daily to look for more bike upgrades.<//Text>

I'm so grateful to have Uptown Bicycles as my official local bike shop. The staff is always helpful, knowledgeable, personable and eager to assist (even if I just stop in to have my tires filled up!)< /text>

<Review>We're from out of town and had biked a good 25 minutes away from our place. My tire popped in a super loud, scary way right in the middle of The Prado. We were pretty bummed that the rest of our day was about to be ruined. We quickly googled "Bike Shops" and found Uptown Bicycles. They saved the day. A quick walk with my crippled bike and they were able to fix us up with a new tube in less than 15 minutes for $15. I was even offered a complimentary beer. I wasn't even upset at popping my tire as the whole experience was nice. Thanks again!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80d954b9b4b93d2b:0x4d2113cbd7e7f62f</gmapID></record>

Chris helped me with bike’s front wheel and was very courteous to show me few tricks as well. I am visiting San Diego with my family and his help will enable us to use our bike at mission bay bike trails! So thank you Chris!!!< /Review>

<Text>I have not, YET, used the labor nor retail service of "UPTOWN." But once I come to "UPTOWN"  ---  I come for 1 reason:   (nearby) HOSPITALity treatment,  for what the down-the-street Adams Ave Bike Shop lacks.
Afterall, a bike mechanic is paid for such treatment for a customer's bike.</Text>< pics>

Cheap, and very long line sometimes. Just turn off car and wait for inexpensive gas, usually 40 cents cheaper than average gas station in the area.<//Review>

20 pumps available but the lines are six cars deep at 8:30 in the morning. That's pretty busy for a Costco gasoline that is the most expensive Costco gasoline I have seen in the entire Bay Area. I drive Uber so I see them all! If I have an option to fuel up at Costco, I always do. this one is probably not worth going out of my way for. Only if in dire need and in this area. It is cheaper than the gasoline at surrounding stations.<//Text>

As always costco gas is popular for it's cheap price. Wish they install 3rd pump in each lane to move the line faster. Love this location has hand sanitizer for its members.</Text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>While the product value is very good (Costco gasoline is almost with exception the lowest price in the area), it is strongly recommended that you pick your time wisely to fill up.  If you go at a "good" time, there will only be 2-3 cars in front in any given lane of you (5 minute wait) whereas at a "bad" time, the line length stretches to 12, 15, or 20 cars (30-40 minute wait).  And, worse, because this location is in Pacific Commons shopping center -- a location with very poor traffic management -- you can find yourself sitting in the Costco gas line and not even being sure which line you are in (if any).</Review>< Pics>

The wit here during the lunch hour is 15-20 mins. The good part being it is located just of I-880 so easy to get on and get off. On weekend the queue can get very long as it is surrounded by variety of different stores. I prefer weekdays.< /text>

Yes, it's Costco gas, which means it's generally cheaper than a lot of other places, but this location is a bit pricier than other Costco gasoline in the bay area. I come to this one frequently because of it being the only one in the lower east bay region, and it is a love hate relationship. The people that come here for gas never pay attention and leave several stalls open because they don't see the cars at the front finish and drive away. The staff also aren't very proactive and getting the lines moving.< /text>

Lines are almost always long because there is a super busy Costco, plus the waiting lines were not properly controlled so lots of cluttering. Also only 2 pumps per row.

Tip: this one closes at 8PM on Sunday (in comparison to some that closes at 7PM)< /text>

Go early and its always easier.  i think the biggest reason is this is a commercial place area.  There arnt alot of residency atound like other costco gasosline.  Ofcouse after the morning hours it will start to packed.< /Review>

<Review>Enjoyed lunch with grandkids......we ordered bean and cheese burritos, crunchy tacos El fresco, cheese quesadillas and nachos. All of them were served as ordered, hot and fresh. The only downside was that they forgot to put napkins in the bag other than that our dinner was excellent.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Text>Lately it’s been one right after the other. This is our go to for our lunches.  No matter how simple I try to make my picky order they screw it up! It’s become a thing every time we come here.  The manager is amazing and working on getting her crew to make the orders right. But it’s not working.

Today my husband took my item back in because yet again they didn’t do it right. This time there was a full staff of Spanish speaking and it made him so uncomfortable when their standing there talking in Spanish and glancing at him, as if he was their topic for that moment.  Not even right.</Text>< Pics>

< review>
If you ask for your meal to be remade because it was made wrong the first time, expect an attitude. If they know you as a regular, they'll start halfassing your meal regardless of how sincere or not busy they are.

This has been a common theme for a few months since they cannot seem to make things properly, or bag them properly. If you plan on taking the survey, make sure they give you a receipt. I asked for mine, since I knew this was going to happen again, and it was left out.

I do the small donation of rounding up change for their employees, I try to be understanding of mistakes, yet even the managers will give you an attitude.

The food is delicious, when the toppings actually make it into the shell or burrito and not dropped into a bag to break the shell.<//review>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>I was looking for something other than a burger, so I stopped into our local Taco Bell. A very nice young man greeted me at the door (yes, at the door). I asked him if the XXL burrito was still available. He told me that the 7 layer burrito was available, and patiently described it for me. I ordered it with seasoned fries and a medium Mountain Dew. It was perfect, and really hit the spot, all for under $10. My order was ready in under 5 minutes. The restaurant was very clean. I'll be eating there a lot more.< /Review>< gmapID>

Taco bell is good when you're starving. Then you begin questioning yourself. What did I just eat? Did I just eat that? I can't believe I just ate that. I feel horrible. My body feels horrible. Regrets ☹️ but it's tasty though

Ordered online they forgot to give me hot sauce</text>

<review>So I've been going to this taco bell for 15+ years and its had its ups and downs with service and employees as well as food quality but tonight was a different story my fiance and I walked in to sit while eating and was greeted at the door by a taco bell employee by the name of Kyle who held the door open for us as we walked in. he was very friendly and pleasant. Food was on point fresh and quick as ever all in all it was a nice change not having all taco bell employees with meh emotions</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80ece9d69e92745f:0xc627250326aefd43< /GmapID></record>

The Taco Bell in Atascadero, California is GREAT! Orders are right and the food is delicious.  I like the bean burritos with onion the best.  You should go there and meet Kyle.  Best employee ever.  He will get your order right!</Text>

<Review>I ordered a seven-layer burrito, two nachos with two side of jalapenos and a side of steak, my dog loved the steak, as for me they didn't put the lids on the jalapenos so all of food was soggy and I asked for extra fire sauce and I didn't get any. Taco Bell was my first job so I know it's not that hard to read what's on the screen. And the other day when I went there the guy told me to have a decent day, what kind of customer service is that?</Review>< Gmap_id>

What can I say it is Taco Bell. They have decent food at good prices. The best thing about Taco Bell is Mountain Dew Baja Blast. It's not the world's greatest food and it's also not the world's worst food like I said it's Taco Bell need I say more.</review>

Servers dont confirm orders to the line, have had multiple orders completely messed up recently...either train your staff or fire them and start over.  I've lived here for 40 years and this location has now lost not only my business, but my friends and families as well!!!< /review>

<Text>Got a chicken quesadilla instead of the steak ordered, 3 different burritos all marked the same so we couldn't tell who's was who's, the burrito with the extra sauce and extra cheese actually had cheese, unlike the other bean and cheese burrito that was just beans and sauce and finally we found a hair in the food. Otherwise it was at least clean and they were fast.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Clean bathrooms and dining room. Never had sanitary issues. Once in a while they'll forget something, or get the order incorrect, but other than that, mostly helpful employees. Fast food for cheap prices. There's nothing particularly special about this specific Taco Bell.< /text>

We consider this the best Taco Bell on the central coast. Our orders are always exactly as we order them, they've never forgotten an item, the staff is friendly, and when you say "extra cheese" or "extra sauce", etc, they actually do it!! Magic!! Kudos to the staff and management. Now  please go train the Morro Bay Taco Bell. Cheers! 😄</Review>

<text>Today I went into the restaurant and stood in line. The customer in front of me said watch out for the cashier she grabbed his drink cup with one hand and put her fingers into the cup with the other hand after handling money. I stepped up and ordered. Sure enough she grabbed the cup and then with the other hand she put her fingers into the cup. I asked for another cup, giving her the reason why. She made a face at me and slammed the other cup on the counter. I told her its a health violation and she roller her eyes. At that point I asked for the manager. She refused. I asked again. She refused. Third time asking she finally got the manager.
I explained to the manager what happen and her reply was she's new. I explained her attitude was a major issue. I went and sat down waiting for my order. I watched the girl working the drive through window approach the cashier who helped me. I front of me they whispered and the cashier made more faces. The drive through girl looked right at me after making fun of the situation. At this point I asked for the person above the manager who allowed this to happen right in front of her. Julie Scott came out of the office and listened to my story. I asked for a business card. I was given a posted note. Health risk and sad employee supervision. Watch them and  video  it. Post it and maybe they'll change.</text><date>1499130056167< /date>< gmapID>

I can't say how many times I have gotten the wrong order or didn't get everything I ordered. There also was another time where I had ordered a couple of things with one substitute and I ended up waiting over 15 minutes for my order. And to me waiting is one thing, however an employee asking me what I ordered again, and telling me it is on it's way out two or three times, now that's another. While I was waiting for this order this day I witnessed one of the employees drop a few things and look around to see if anyone saw (as if should I wash this?) she noticed I was looking and then turned around right away to go wash it.<//Review>< pictures>

I've been coming to taco bell in Atascadero since it opened.  The last 2 times I was in the drive through lane someone has cut in front of me. I walked up to the guy who cut and asked him to get in line like everyone else . He refused so I stood in front of the speaker and wouldn't let him order. Instead of backing me up and telling him to go around the right way they backed this idiot up. Well they just lost me as an over 30 year costumer because they have no backbone.</Text>

<user>104668387412262257248<//user><resp>None< /resp><Review>This Bell is fine and we go by probably 2-3x a month, but we had the most awkward experience today. Generally, the staff is ok, but the girl on drive-thru this afternoon was the oddest ever! First, didn't repeat our order, talked over us to get our drink order, and then seemed annoyed when we wanted to make sure she heard us. Ok, whatever. In person...wow. Said NOTHING. Just STARED. Had her hand out the window with our drink and actually pulled her hand back when my husband went to get it because I was counting out the entire $6 we owed. Not that she had a second hand out, we practically could have grabbed and gone as she wasn't paying attention. We would say thank you and she would just close the window or STARE and then close the window. We wanted some mild sauce? How dare we...STARE. It wasn't that she didn't hear us (or if that were the case, maybe ask us to say it again). No customer service whatsoever, even what little you might expect from fast food.

I have to say the staff has come a long way since May it made everything wonderful and even took the time to answer a question telling me that the current had took me far from where I was stationed and it was really nice for him to mention that it made it easier to find where I was sunbathing< /review>

<date>1539133649666<//date><review>At Sunset Beach down the way I think they're HB lifeguards as well but sometimes they are too quick to jump b/c they think that you're having trouble just because of your splashing around a little bit... I'm from the Midwest ... But have been here in Southern Cal for many many years now ( and also lived in Hawaii for a while so I know my beaches , 🤠😎trust me) but I still have a little bit of Midwest in me and we like to Splash in the water, not Just sit on surfboards, 🏄🏄‍♀️🏄‍♂️ and that doesn't mean we're having trouble . so just a little tip for any lifeguards: I can swim .. & I  love to body surf...and sometimes I go with the current (the strong side current like a river I just go with it and then I enjoy the walk back up the beach) and 99.9% of the time I am fine, just fine ...you don't need me to rescue me... in Fact I've never needed to be rescued ...thank you very much. What the lifeguards really need to do is have a universal unique arm motion so that people who really need help can signal they need help, or try to. 🏊🏊‍♀️🏊‍♂️</review>< response>

It was very windy so that may alter my opinion on it. However I always say a lifeguard watching the water and ,what I would call, beach patrol driving on the beach making sure everyone was safe.< /Text>

They raise the prices so consistently it becomes pretty impossible to stay. On top of the fact that I was mislead about reasonable prices and rent raises.<//review>

Spots way to close for RVs. Not only was my tail light busted in less than a month but I just busted my other neighbors mirror tying to get my little 25 foot out! Way too close and trailors in front...no room. Tractor trailor 53' pro driver over 8 years...accident free. I know how to pull a trailer.</Text>

Unbeatable prices. Super clean units, the drive up kind. Units well laid out with easy access and they had carpenters on site working on  improvements. They also accommodate RV’s, boats, trailers, etc.  Rosemary the Manager was extremely professional and easy to work with. When she answered all our questions and gave us a tour it was quite evident she both enjoyed her job and took it seriously. We have rented storage units for years and have not came across someone of her caliber with exceptional customer service, attention to detail including security, and a very cheerful attitude. It was a pleasure and doing the paperwork with her was a breeze. We recommend the place and the owner made a super smart hire with management.
Sincerely,
The Cody’s.< /text>

Adrian, you are Everything Awesome!  By far the best customer service I have received in such a long time. Friendly, honest, and very forthcoming.  She went above and beyond to make sure I was getting the best deal and with no pressure.  Most definitely top notch service. Thank you! Thank you!< /text>

Pick this place. Here's why:
1. The place is clean and in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Easy access to main freeway and main street.
2. Their main manager Lance is kind of a superhero. Ultra-professional, mega nice. You'll wish he was also your friend.

I had just finished a long drive from Chicago. Thankfully, they made the experience painless and effortless. Get this, afterward, I wasn't able to turn my moving truck around on the street (it had a 4-wheel car tow on the back. Lance came out and personally guided me to safely make the turnaround. Way above and beyond good customer service!<//Text>

I tell you this place is the most welcoming storage facility I have ever been to.  I LOVE the manager Adrian she is so personable and welcoming.  She provides exemplary customer service especially compared to other facilities I have been to.  Also it seemed like she was really catering to MY needs not just trying to push me a storage twice the size of what I needed. The office is very welcoming and smells fresh.  Before coming here I went to one and couldn't go in because the smell of smoke was so off putting.   I love that the facility is so nice and clean.  If you are shopping around yes there may be some cheaper places but remember you get what you pay for.  Ill pay the extra 5 bucks for the peace of mind I get from the manger who gives you that sense of security to leave your cherishables when you are unable to take them with you.   PICK THIS ONE you wont be disappointed.< /Text>

Raised my rate by 15% without notice. Then told me I was at my unit too long and to stop coming there so often...even though I need to store my property daily. THEY WANT ME TO STAY AWAY FROM THE UNIT I PAY THEM TO ACCESS !?! When I accessed my unit 3 days later they removed my gate permission and I could not get to my stuff. CRAZY!!!

I'm paid up for three months ahead, helped the manager with her car when it wouldn't start and stayed late to help when the gate came off the tracks and this is the thanks I get. They're just a bunch of phonies, find a unit somewhere else.<//Text>

<review>Pros: The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The storage unit was clean and free of bugs! When we had a problem the manager tried to resolve it the best she could.
Cons: If you refer a friend make sure you get your discount- don't wait.

We were satisfied in our experience and will come back again if we need to have storage again.< /review>< pictures>

Extra Space Storage in Grand Terrace gave me exactly what I was looking for. It is a very convenient place to store my belongings and I was given a very clean unit. The manager on duty, Adrian, was very helpful and attentive. I would recommend this facility to anyone else in the area that has storage needs.</Review>

I got to work with Frank Johnson and he was exceptionally helpful. Gave us the first two months free and we moved our stuff in right after Christmas. Really put the jingle bells in our holiday.<//review>

< Review>
Renter's Beware! Only two weeks in our RV was broken into. The police said they received calls all the time at this location. The officer found another trailer broken into and lived in while we were there. The front desk clerk said the cameras dont work and to just file an insurance claim, wow! This property is not secure or monitored. Wish I could rate zero star.</Review>

Worst place to have your stuff stored customer service suck an the new owners are not to taking care of their customers!  As soon as I can I will be taking  my business some where else have not been happy with them since they changed new owners ! Yea I can't even get into my own storage cause of them an I have to go sit there for them to do the latch switch which they should of done that when they made us change our locks to their stupid locks that don't even fit so now I'm locked out of my own storage but have to keep paying for my storage unit which I should be getting a discount for the inconvenience but nope . Sorry place<//Text>

< Review>
I've been a renter at ExtraSpace for about 7 months and the staff (Adrian & Frank) at the Grand Terrace location have always done everything possible to assure I am satisfied always.

A week ago I was moving a Bicycle from the storage unit and discovered I didnt have the tools required to break parts of the bike down. I had resolved to leave the bike in Grand Terrace until my next visit that's when Frank asked if he could be of assistance. I told him my plight and he said he just might have the tools in his truck that would do the job. He had the tools and 15 years experience as an AirForce Mechanic that made quick work of the task.

When you want a good storage location with great people that run the establishment with a fantastic approach to customer service, think ExtraSpace Storage Grand Terrace, Ca.<//Review>

Perfect place to get oil change. Just like anywhere, if you go during peak hours you will wait a long time but the staff is always courteous and helpful. I love going there. Very convenient
UPDATE: back again in Apr 2021, waiting longer than usual, but its peak hours and you can tell they are under staffed. Still courteous and friendly though. I don't mind waiting a little bit.< /Text>

<Text>I have always been a loyal customer, my car was working completely great never any lights always kept up with the maintenance TILLLL I went in to get an oil change and steering fluid in March 2021. I had about 7 people working on my car and some new employees. Drove my car home about 7 miles down the road and my car was smoking and caught on fire. Valvoline sent a Technician out to tell me they would want to take my car to a local mechanic to determine what started the fire. I did not feel comfortable with that knowing my car is a Mercedes and should be taken to the dealership to get a biased diagnostic on what started the fire. Valvoline was not having it they said if I didnt take it to Mario's Service Center they would step out the scene and not provide me a rental car or a tow service to the shop. I said fine you can step out the scene and I will be sending an invoice to them. Long story short, the Mercedes dealership found out quickly a saturated oil rag started the fire around my manifold. Valvoline insurance claims they did not leave the rag there after 24 days of "looking at the cameras". Completely frustrated how everything was handled aside from my car being charbroiled. Suing them currently and never will go to this place again 0/10 recommend.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Rate>

I received a quote for a oil change and tire rotation and when i asked them to go through with the tire rotation they said they did not have the “time” for one but proceeded to continue with my oil change. Why quote me for a job you cannot go through with because of your lack of time management.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>I used to love this place but after todays experience I will not be coming back. I was so disappointed with todays service. I had the radiator fluid changed and as we are driving away my cars check engine light turned on and the car began to shake.We brought the car back and are now sitting in the car hoping somone can fix the mistake they did. I would suggest before you service your car here you make sure the person working on your car knows what they are doing.<//text>< Pictures>

I waited for over two hours, I was moved to another bay. Waited there while the person to left and right of me that were behind me went through. Both finished before me and even one more after them finished before me. I had just an oil change, they didn’t even check the air in my tires.</Text>

<Text>I've come here the last three times to get my oil changed. The mechanics do a good inspection of your car. The first time I went to get an oil change they noticed my tire was bulging outward from it's side and told me to change it ASAP. Good thing I did, because it was ready to pop any moment according to American Tire. Thanks for looking out and being honest.</Text><time>1573861873004<//time><response>None</response>< pictures>

Dirty hands all over the car.  The guy almost broke my glove compartment trying to get it off, would have if I hadn't said to forget about it.  Took 20 min the change a filter for the motor, then broke something off it that fell below.  I was taking 2 cars here every month, will not take them here again.<//review>

Arrived shortly after lunch on a Friday.   Bays 1 and 3 had cars in line.   All bays were full and I parked behind the waiter in bay 1.  After 30 minutes,  they closed bay 3 and then had folks shuffle their cars,  and they put me behind someone who arrived after I did.   As I'm still waiting,  four people who arrived after I did got their car serviced before me,  and I'm still waiting in line.  They need to implement a better way to get to their customers in order,  especially if they're going to shuffle folks.</Text>

Easiest place to get an oil change. Do not even have to get out of the car. Usually in and out in 10 minutes or so. They offer a variety of services alongside the normal oil change. Great customer service 👍<//Review>

Sometimes its fast sometimes slow depends on the time I think. Everyone is always friendly and patient... they always top off and check fluids as well as besides changing oil and filters they also change light bulbs< /Review>

No co-ordinates vehicle's as they pull in.
Have no problem waiting my turn. But it's extremely frustrating when they ask me to move over and let vehicle's move ahead of me when I was there before them.

Not the first time this has happened.
I have watched several customer's leave<//Text>

< review>
I just needed a top off got there at 12:10. All the bays were full and there was only two cars in front of us. They got those two in within 20 minutes then a car pulled up behind us. 5 minutes later they pulled the car behind us into the next available bay then another car pulled up behind us and they start to pull him into the next bay until I get the workers attention and explained to him that they were not helping us like we should have been. The guy proceeds to tell me I did notice we got that guy in before you I’m sorry it shouldn’t be much longer. Worst service I’ve ever experienced in my life waited 40 minutes just to get a top off. All I know is the next time I come here I better be getting a free oil change.</review>

Make sure you check you oil or fluids. On my case  went in for oil and transmission fluid change.. at the end my transmission fluid was still dark as it was before..spilled fluid on my front quarter panel. i ask why was still dark and he tried to give a dumb explanation. Point is they said they did it but no way there was no change on the color at all... So he offer to do it again this time fluid was red as it suppose to be.. ..please do what customer is paying for..and make sure you dont return vehicles with  oil spills all over and greasy hands marked on the outside. And thank you for filling up my windshield fuid with rotten one it stinks bad when i use it.... Im very disappointed.. just wondering if my motor oil was filled with full synthetic just how i ask and paid for. Tire pressure all different . 41. 42. 38. 36. They need a new crew.<//text>

I have only good things to say about the team at the Riverbank Valvoline. They perform the services thoroughly and quickly, and the pricing is very fair.

I know it's their job to recommend, or even sell, other services, but they present those things in a reasonable way and didn't push me at all to buy things I didn't want or need. They even made a point to explain that because of the location of my oil filter, and what they had to do to clean around that area, I might see some dripping from my car for a few hours, but that I shouldn't be concerned about that. It was just what remained from their cleaning up.

I also showed up with a new battery that I had purchased elsewhere, and they installed it for me at no extra charge.

These guys (so far I've only seen guys working there) do a great job at a fair price. Tough to beat that.<//Text>

< review>
Out of all the places I've been to for my general car maintenance, this place takes the top.  Fair prices, decent wait times, and friendly staff that aren't as pushy on services as most other places.  They have found things on my cars over the years that I miss and always have a recommendation if it's something they can fix.

They even gave me a few pointers on the safest way to tighten the drain plug on the oil pan on my civic, after I had stripped the previous pan when I replaced the gasket on it and ended up buying a new pan since I didn't want to tap the plug.  Why do I go to them for oil changes if I can change an oil pan?  Because I don't like going under my car and these guys find stuff I miss .  Plus, I don't feel like having bottles of every fluid for both of my cars in the garage.

The one time they had oil spill a little underneath the car, they cleaned up everything pretty well.  I had noticed some smoke from the oil later on, and came back and they cleaned it again right away even though the car had stopped smoking by the time I made it back.  These guys are on top of it when it comes to customer service.</review>

We take both our vehicles here for oil services. The staff is very professional and friendly and it's always a quick process when we stop on for a oil change or a top off and tire pressure check.</Review>

<text>Very disappointed at the parts department. My backpack was stolen while traveling and it had one of the key fob's in it. I bought this MINI only 3 months ago at this dealership and this dealership quoted me $540.00 for a replacement.
I was going to be in Phoenix the next week, so I called a dealership in the area and what a difference. What a difference in customer service as well. They were sorry to hear what happened and quoted me $340.00 plus tax. This is for the exact programmed key fob.
Thank you so much to Alex @  MINI of Tempe!

With that being said about the parts department, Rocky in sales was great to work with. Everything discussed on the phone before getting to the dealership was spot on when arriving at the dealership.< /text>< user_id>

Not our first time buying a car, not even our first time at a BMW/MINI dealership, but definitely our first time feeling so good about the whole experience. Javier helped us pick the car, we had a fun genuine and simply human conversation about life, cars, music and some more cars :) Any questions we had he answered in great detail, when he made suggestions he brought up pros and cons and straight up told us when certain things didn’t make sense for our particular situation and needs, which, by the way, he took great care in finding out first.
Not once did we feel like we were being sold something, or pushed something that we didn’t need or didn’t come there for. And the crazy thing, the same trend continued as we went to sign papers and talk about additional services and packages. Rafi was helping us in the office and showed us a detailed breakdown of pros and cons of each service in a very concise way to avoid wasting anybody’s time and gave us fantastic deals on the few services that we did want to get. Again, just simple, genuinely nice experience. These guys are total rockstars and we couldn’t recommend them enough. This is how buying cars should feel like.< /Text>

I have purchased 2 new Minis here for my personal use:  A 2015 Coupe S and a 2021 2 door Hardtop S.  Fun and fabulous vehicles- I've never had one problem.  Great sales and finance staff.  Be sure to ask for Javier! I got excellent deals on both of the cars along with high dollar amounts for my trade-ins.<//Review>

First class experience from the entire team. I had done my research and knew I was getting a great price on a used Countryman S so I booked a flight from Boise.  Rocky made arrangements for me to be picked up at airport.

Transaction completed  in less than an hour and I was on the road.

<Review>Sales manager Rocky Chow helped us get our 2020 Cooper S, and was helpful from start to finish. Explained everything six ways to Sunday, and helped us pick the packages we needed to suit our needs. The selection is limited due to COVID, but they can order you vehicles from out of state too. 10/10 would recommend getting a Mini here, and always ask for Rocky!< /Review>< username>

Is this is the way  your dealership  do business ?
Well, I'll take my business elsewhere that I would be respected as a potential buyer.

I purchased a new 2020 Mini Countryman S from Javier; it is the second Mini I have bought from him. Why, because he is the ultimate professional, gentleman and made this experience even greater than the first. Genuine and authentic, he is why we came back.  And it will be the reason for the next one, next time.  Thanks Javier.</text>

<Text>I had a couple of items needing repairing on my Mini that were under warranty. I made an appointment and took the car in. I talked with De about what needed to be done and along with the repairs he noted my next service was due next month and advised to get it done now and save a trip. They let me use a loan car since the repairs and service would take a couple of days. When my car was repaired and serviced I received a call to pick it up. All repairs were competed along with the service. I have been very satisfied with the service department and De at Mini of Monrovia.< /Text>< Response>

<Review>Long-time MINI owner and customer at MINI of Monrovia so it is with serious disappointment that I share this review re: my most recent experience (Oct. 2020). Dropped car off on a Friday for diagnostic with understanding that would need to leave it over night. However, did not receive any direct communication (phone call or text) on Saturday giving me a status update. I called and no one answered, so I left a message asking that someone return my call and provide me with an update. No one returned my call and since they are closed on Sunday, I was without a car for the entire weekend. This is HIGHLY unprofessional. I called first thing Monday morning, again had to leave a message and once I received a call back was informed that the needed part had to be ordered and would be in that day. There is no reason this update should not have been provided to me on Saturday. When I eventually picked up my car, they had not washed my car either (which is supposedly a standard service provided anytime you bring your car in). I am thoroughly disappointed in the way this service center is operating and will take my regular service needs elsewhere from now on.<//Review>< user_id>

I am exceptionally happy with the service I received at the Mini dealership of Monrovia. I had gone to another Mini dealership in Southern California (based on reviews)  and was extremely disappointed with the service I had received. The Mini dealership of Monrovia took their time to get to know me and my credit history. They were strategic when finding banks to help finance the car I wanted. Most importantly, they made me a better offer on my APR, they beat the APR that my teacher credit union was offering me. If you are going to buy a Mini then the dealership in Monrovia is the one you want to go to. Exceptional in every aspect! I love my Mini!<//Text>

<Text>Josh Tsiu made our time at the Mini of Monrovia a very welcoming, Super friendly, very professional and helpful experience. We really enjoyed Josh for the time that he spent and made us feel at home. We are more than excited to work with josh again because of the way he explained each and every detail on the book about a car, making sure no detail was missed before purchasing, to also ensure that we are going in the right direction for a reliable car. The drive test was so exciting as well, allowing us to get the feel of the car and explaining what are the features inside. Josh is your man to go!

Freaking rats eat the cables in my Mini. I took it to Mini of Monrovia where they found the problem quickly. The process was long because it required a full inspection of the vehicle, plus ordering a bunch of parts. Jason, the technician associated to my case was very responsive all the time, keeping me updated at every step. The car was fixed timely as soon as the parts were available. Great service overall!< /text>

<Review>I made an appointment for 12:30 and arrived on time. The service was brake fluid and oil change. I did not get my car until 2:50 pm. Additionally, I've kept my rear bumper spotless for three years, and sure enough the car was returned with a small mark on it, which I discovered 24 hours later. I am considering leasing another MINI; now, however, I'm inclined to look into other brands where the level of dealership service is timely and competent.  I will not be returning to this dealership.

UPDATE 9/2020

I am reducing my rating from two stars to one, because I am pestered by unwanted emails from MINI of Monrovia, despite repeated efforts to unsubscribe. I advise future visitors not to share your email address with this dealership.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>at mini BMW Monrovia  the team of associates that work in the service department the service advisors and the service manager made my mini cooper dream a nightmare. when i had service done on my mini cooper just recent. aside from the problem that had to be repaired. the service department workers damaged my mini cooper some how. the service manager with his 'i don't care attitude" denies breaking my mini cooper and then the service manager called me a lair. and  told me that mini was not going to pay for the damages that they done to my mini cooper. i have been waiting for someone from the service department to reach out to me. they still have not responded back.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzg0vP6kUhAOHME3yinuXU4kkhCvxhYOUzB2Y_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Fro the time I walked in to the time I did drive my new car 🚘 out of dealership, treated like a value customer, they took their time to explain every question I asked to answer. Friendly, calm, smile and good knowledge of their products. I recommend to see Bruce Harris  if you have any questions.<//Text>

Brandon did a great job as a sales rep keeping us entertained through the grueling paperwork nightmare of buying a car in So Cal! Would recommend him and the dealership to whoever is in the BMW / Mini mindset!<//Review>

Been talking to every sales rep possible in the LA area looking for a lease. Rocky was the only one who would give me straight answer with the drive off price of the vehicle, exactly as advertised, unlike all the other dealerships that tacked on other excessive dealership, documentation, and acquisition fees. The dealership was open during this COVID situation and the staff that I saw all had on masks. They did have limited stock, but were very upfront with pricing and the exact values on paper. With negotiations, they didn't do the usual "let me go ask my manager" and disappear for 20 minutes and come back with a "no sorry" and waste your time. Rocky and Ray were in front of me as me negotiated and was showing me their calculations as they input them in the computer and could tell me yes or no within minutes. Rocky was always willing to ask for my prices, unlike other sales who would tell me "no this is a great deal already" and try to tell me otherwise. Highly recommend working with them.<//Text>

<text>Typically the car buying/leasing process is usually never easy, It's usually a daunting process to be honest...

But luckily, me and my wife had an amazing experience with Javier, he was by far the most detail oriented and knowlegable salesman I've ever purchased from. My wife contacted him prior to us arriving to save time and be courteous considering the whole Covid-19 sitch,  and as soon as we arrived Javier greeted us and made us laugh with a couple aswesome stories he told us, answered all the questions we had knowledably while never over forcing the sale. He's a genuine dude for sure, and would HIGHLY recommend you choose to work with him when shopping here!

The whole Mini of Monrovia team handled the entire process with a high sense of professionalism and were super down to earth at the same time, who could ask for a better experience:)

Thank you again Javier, me and Adriana truly appreciated your service...< /text><rate>5</rate>< gmap_id>

Excellent customer service, Advisor, Choi.   Brought my Clubman in due to a sensor light.  Paperwork process from checking in car and rental was quick and efficient.  Communication status of car through text and email was appreciated. Car was done within 48 hours.  Advisor Choi did offer additional services for present and future considerations regarding the care on my Clubman, thank you.  Well done.</Text>

My car was making a choppy/stuttering sound and I was due for an oil change so I brought it into service. Jason was my service advisor and I told him my concerns with the engine/loud sound. I also asked him to check for anything else that I needed to change (i.e. fuel filters) but he told me that MINI usually has good fuel filters but that he would still advise service to check it anyways. Jason also assisted me with the car loaner department and when I expressed concern about when I should drive back or how long my car would take, he reassured me that he would keep me updated on the progress and to keep the loaner car as long as I had needed during service. Later Jason texted me and said that we had a faulty thermostat and the water pump pulley was missing a chunk. His explanation was detailed and very helpful for me to understand, as I don't know much about cars. The next day I got a message saying that my car was ready but Jason told me to wait another day because he wanted to make sure that the oil change was done in addition to the other work. He was very helpful throughout the whole process and I would recommend him as a service advisor to anyone who has a MINI.< /Text>

Jason is my consultant who is professional and friendly. On this Black Friday morning, we have an recall appointment, he arranged a nice loan car during the service, and service is fantastic and faster than I thought, more service completed than request, what I can say, I am lucky to have this consultant and dealer to service me almost 3 years, thanks for all !<//text>

<review>Everyone was SO helpful!!! Since the first time I walked in. Josh was easy to work with, listened to what I wanted. He was never pushy like the other sales people I dealt with at other dealerships. He even got me the black mini I wanted and got my monthly payments close to what I wanted. I thought I’d have to sell my old mini myself, but josh suggested we come in and still try and see what the trade in would be and they got me what I thought I’d get!! I was so happy! Loved everything about this dealership and will come back and recommend to anyone looking for a mini.

It was nice to run into the guys who helped sell us two of our cars, they are always so sweet. Our car was nice and clean when we got it back which was a plus. Overall it was a very good experience and you are all doing a great job, thank you.<//Review>< Pics>

I came in because I got an email for a recall on my vehicle and since the moment I walked in I was greeted really fast and told what to expect. I was told that needed to wait since there were other customers waiting so I asked to be shuttle back to work but they offered me a rental which it was amazing service thank you so much for that.< /review>

Update 03/16/2019
Management at BMW & Mini of Monrovia, found out about the service we received from Sonic Automotive sales associate Rocky. Management felt so bad, they contacted us directly and apologize profusely. In addition they set the car aside, washed it, filled the car with gas and made the purchase quick and easy. The service at BMW of Monrovia and the staff, especially Management were great.

Horrible car buying experience! Contacted Rocky at Mini of Monrovia regarding a car. I was told the price was firm but then watched it drop four times. Asked some questions regarding safety & the condition since it was different than advertised & just put off. Then I drove 75 miles to see the car which was not as described (condition & accidents). I did let him know that I needed my wife to see it & would be back Sunday. Drove all the way out again and was told they had someone coming to look at it (not sold). Very poor customer service & follow through. A contact would be nice before having traveled all that way & go with a sale before just someone looking at it. Start to finish a bad experience!<//Text>

Great experience with leasing a new car.  Abby Barrientos really took care of me.  She remembered me even though I hadn't returned in months.  She also remembered which car and color I liked.  After I looked at their inventory and test drove a few cars, she knew I wasn't happy.  When she couldn't find the one I wanted, she checked the loaner car status, and there it was in the adjacent BMW lot, my perfect Mini Cooper.  I love my Mini Cooper.  It's the cutest car I've ever had.  Couldn't be happier.< /text>

They provided roadside assitance phone number for me to call since my car wouldnt start and was offered a shuttle service also the person there had rescheduled my service appointment. Had I not called to confirm about the appointment I wouldnt have known whether to call for roadside to tow my car into the mini cooper dealership.  I can only say I was dissapointed to not have my car washed since I had my car serviced.
As a tip I would suggest advising clients to provide roadside service phone number and let them know that they need to schedule the pick up along with service at the dealership. I was assuming I'd receive a call back from Mini Cooper to ask and have a tow truck scheduled for pick up.</Text><time>1588948928807< /time><username>olive oil</username><rate>3<//rate>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Recently had some work done on my daughter's 2008 Clubman.  There were a couple difficult issues as one can imagine with a ten year old car.  But Rudy Sanchez stepped up and made sure everything worked out for us.  He went out of his way to make sure we were happy with the results...and we are.  I feel he really cared about our situation and the fact that my daughter really loves this car and I can not say thank you enough for the customer service...no, customer CARE he provided and continues to provide.  I would be extremely happy to recommend this dealer to anyone and look forward to doing business there in the future.  Rudy, I am grateful more than you could know for your attention and help with our situation and making my girl so happy.  You are a huge asset to your company.</Review>< Pictures>

BMW of Monrovia is by far a more professional experience than my local BMW dealer.  I had to drive 180 miles from my home to meet with the staff at BMW of Monrovia, but it was worth the drive.  Not only did I get a better deal on my new car I also felt that the details of my trade in, and the purchase were taken car of properly.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwlOMIHXDCvctYPpqJp9Hm17_Js9dcdoDJY3eR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2d909325926bd:0x82e7b2e529d9a10</GmapID></record>

<Name>Peter Alden< /Name><Response>None< /Response><text>Sales staff was great. Easy to work with, comfortable, I feel like I got a good deal. They gave me all the information I wanted and looked stuff up when they didn't know. (To be fair I was buying a trade in truck at a mini dealership so not knowing everything about the truck was fair)

I knew it was going to go well when I called ahead and asked the sales person  to bring the truck to the front and he brought two similar trucks to the front. Didn't even have to walk inside, he was waiting for me. (Thanks Javier)

I'm not 100% on the financing guys. I asked for the details on the extended warranty and he sent me the sales brochure instead of the details.  There aslo is some confusion about working with my bank. I have a lot of faith that'll be cleared up without too much extra effort. None of that stopped me from driving the truck home so minor hiccup in an otherwise excellent experience.

I live in LA and would drive to Monrovia to deal with this dealership again. Thanks guys.<//text>< rate>

I had been in communication with a sales agent for about a week regarding a specific MINI that I saw online and fell in love with. The sales agent was super helpful and did everything to create the best deal for me. The MINI was detailed and ready when I showed up for my test drive and the terms of the deal were exactly as negotiated. The process was smooth, I didn't feel pressured or rushed and the MINI is amazing!<//text>

Went into the dealership on a busy weekend day and was helped by Brian W (sales) who was wonderful, friendly, and genuine. He knew his job well & my sales experience with him was efficient and memorable. (The only thing I’d add that since I went on a weekend, the finance part of the car buying experience had a long wait so I’d encourage the dealership to have more financial personnel on staff on a busy Sunday). Other than that, it was a great experience and I’d recommend this dealership with its friendly salesman (Brian W) & the huge selection they have is awesome. Thanks for a great experience.< /review>

Matt Clark was my service adviser and I can't tell you what a relief it was to have someone so honest.  I went to another "convenient for me" BMW dealership before, and boy, did I get ripped off :(.  Matt was sooo kind, helpful and honest and did not try to persuade me into anything, he just stated the facts.  Even though Monrovia is quite a trek for me... I will never go anywhere else!!  Also, I have to say that Bruce Harris is awesome as well!! We've been buying our cars from him for years!!! He is one of the most honest, kind and caring people I've met.  He goes the extra mile to make sure you have a fabulous experience when purchasing your car, no last minute surprises and he even delivered my car to my home.. wow, what service!!

<rate>2</rate><Text>The customer service at this dealership is a circus. I had to call SIX times and talk to NINE people (at least half of these "people" were voicemails that never called me back... it has been more than a week at this point) to schedule a repair appointment. I only went here because I had no other choice due to the nature of the repair. I took my car here a few years ago and was treated so poorly I just left without the service and did not ever intend on going back. I felt judged and disrespected as a young female with a BMW. They treated me like I was incompetent and expected to be able to rip me off. Little do they know I am currently pursuing a doctoral degree. Looks can be deceiving. When I reluctantly returned for my recent appointment, Matt was really helpful and kind. If you go here, request an appointment with Matt. They did a good job with the service and cleaned the outside of my car for no additional charge which I really appreciated. I will still go elsewhere when I can (oil changes or simple repairs), but when I do go to the dealership I will be dealing with Matt. The man who shuttled me from the dealership when my car was being worked on was very kind, and the young man who greeted me in the service department was also very nice. The problem here is what goes on outside the service department. I would rate the service department 5/5 but I would rate the secretaries/those who answer the phones and schedule appointments a generous 1/5.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

To my surprise, I was able to make an appointment that same morning online and drove myself right in.  Service was great.  I love dealing with professionals.  All services to be performed were itemized clearly on a printout.  I waited for about 2 hours and received my vehicle on time and washed.  Even though my warranty/maintenance had already expired, I still brought it in to the dealer because I believed in their work.  Highly recommended.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Had servicing done here for the first time. Everything went smoothly and beyond expectation. My advisor Caroline, communicated consistently with me, which was very helpful; that she kept me in the loop. LOVE the car wash that they thrown in too! I will come back indeed.<//Text>

Best dealership experience I have ever had.
I requested a test drive from online and they contacted me immediately and scheduled an appointment next day.
We only spent less than 30 minutes over all to get the deal done. The fleet manager Tracy was super nice and she never play games on the numbers and will give you the best deal in the market.
I have purchased/leased 5 vehicles within 6 years and this time is the fastest and smoothest.
Highly recommend this BMW dealership<//text>

<review>The service for this dealer is always "A" for effort, but the execution leads something to be desired. My car was with them for 2 and a half days trying to diagnose a loss of power at acceleration.

Their initial diagnosis of my car was incorrect, or mistakenly told to me. Luckily I know a little about cars and I could tell something was wrong. After the a half day more they told me what seemed to be an applicable issue.

That still took a day to fix, which was only replacing spark plugs. Overall I was without my car for 3 days. I feel that my friends that go to other dealers have better experiences.

And also as an unrelated side note: the people who work here seem a little "weird". Not in a quirky-fun way...but in a "there's a gas leak" or something way. It's always been something I've noticed. I don't know how you feel about it, but it's a little off-putting. I'm going to try a different dealer future things.</review>< userid>

Unfortunately this will be the last time I bring my car to this dealership. I specifically dropped off my car with 2 distinct codes, when I picked up the car the code was still present. I promptly alerted the service dept, days later I finally get a response stating the codes weren't present at the time od release. No offer to bring the car back in to address my concerns. No sorry for the inconvenience etc, if you are going to charge 2X prices you should also provide 2X service.< /Review>

<review>This place is close to my home which is great. The service advisor Tim Chen is always very nice and Professional. Place is always clean. Open from 7 to 7 is also very convenient for me.
Only one thing I don’t like is every time I have wait very long time to pick up my car even the car was ready hours ago. Yesterday I went to pick up my car again. Waited for 30 minuets and still no sign of my car is pulling out. So I went to cashier and complained about it. The lady told me many people ahead of me. But when I arrived the dealer and only saw one person was waiting and I saw at least 3 people came after me and got their car already. I do hope they can improve this.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I had an excellent experience buying my first Mini here! My sales associate, Joshua was wonderful to work with, patient and extremely knowledgeable.
Everyone involved with the sale took good care of me and I left with a positive feeling. I will be back here again in the future and will ask Josh to help me...
Highly recommended!<//Text>

There are two reasons I continue with BMW: 1) Great cars with reliability 2) Matt Clark in Service department.  I can honestly say that I NEVER have any problems with maintenance issues, scheduling, loaners, and all around professional service when dealing with Matt. He is a true professional with an exceptional attitude towards customer service. I highly recommend Matt for all your BMW needs.<//text>

Took my mini in to be serviced. The service team was very helpful. I did not have to wait for anyone or have to chase anyone down. They were polite and quick to help me out. Kassandra V was my appointed service advisor. She is great. Super courteous and communicative. Overall, great experience. I love my mini.</Text>

Took my Countryman in for regular services.  Larry Rusk was my service advisor and he was amazing!  I had asked about services that I thought I needed, but he was there to truly advise me what's best for my MINI.  He was a great help, had me in a loaner and on my way in no time at all.  Pick up was the same- he was prompt, courteous and my Countryman was ready to hit the road for more fun.  Thanks, Larry!  You're the best.  We'll see you after another 8000 fun filled miles!< /Review>

Very good service! Jason told me it would be around 2 hrs, so I went to the diner in Sierra and got some breakfast. Then walked back and waited about half an hour, and Jason told me they were done already! Very speedy and convenient. Kinda wish they had more seating area though.< /Text>

I brought my 528i into the service department and my advisor Marie Fakas did a great job with my vehicle. She went above and beyond what I expected. I came in for a oil change and an estimate on a small fender bender and left very happy with repairs and service experience.  I'm bringing my car back for front brake service soon and I'll be using this location for all my future maintenance.<//text>

I usually really like the service there but this time I wasn’t really happy about it.

I have a crack on my windshield and I know it needs to be replaced but for the past 2 weeks I’ve been careful with it, and it have not gotten bigger AT ALL! And yesterday when I get back my car the crack is at least 3 inches bigger.
Now I understand that it has to be replaced and there is nothing I can do about it but I would appreciate it if they could be careful about it! I believe it got bigger when they clean the car! I always do appreciate when they clean the car yes, but when you see a crack can’t you be careful? They told me don’t be surprised if tomorrow it’s event bigger but it’s not! So I know they just weren’t careful ! I am a bit disappointed, and concerned about how they handle my car...<//text>

My Mini was recalled to replace a passenger airbag sensor.  I was able to make an appointment and everything just went without a hitch. The people at Mini of Monrovia were very friendly and provided good service. Using their shuttle service, I was able to visit with a friend while they worked on my car.</Review>

<username>Jayoung Kim<//username><Text>The service department is great-I trust them completely. The loaner department that's a different story. Gave me a car with 9 miles (1/8th of a tank) and the red service light on. The manager (MANAGER) told me that the car only had 9 miles because the previous person didn't put gas in as they requested. Was told there's a gas station down the street.

Took about 45 minutes to get that car. Long process and then I had to come back.

Just saying if the manager completely negates his role and blames it on the previous customer what purpose does he serve?<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Rating>

This service department is fantastic. I was greeted by Robert the minute I pulled up, appointment all set. When the car was done, I received a call and when I arrived my car was clean and ready for me to take home.
I love my MINI and love the way this place takes care of me. This is my third MINI from MINI OF MONROVIA!  See you guys when my lease is up.< /text>

< Review>
I came in with no notice at 9am when they opened this past Tuesday. I was recently involved in a serious car wreck and literally have been suffering from the loss of my old Mini Cooper to my personal injury damages, missed work and pain. I wanted to cry coming in, because I had only just bought my used 2012 Mini (my very first) a short 6 months prior at a random Honda dealer by my house. Wasn’t a fan at first, but fell in love quickly because I felt safe in it. The day I came, I was greeted by Abby and I was so amazed at how helpful and knowledgeable she was. She took me on a few test drives, gave me her full attention for hours, I don’t even think she took a lunch break! She made me feel better without even knowing it, and a few hours later (and 3 trips back to Monrovia from LA for me) I made the decision to lease the manager special you had out front - and it just so happened to be the same color countryman I had before my accident. Instead of 2012, it was 2019. I wanted to cry I was so happy. Yohanna was a miracle manager, he was on the phone all day and was so polite and warm and I can most definitely assure you I would have not bought this car if it weren’t for the PEOPLE you have working there. Robert in Finance stayed til 10pm to sign the papers with me. I’ve had a hell of a month, driving an awful rental while my car was being looked at for damages, and I am so thankful to say I purchased from you, even though I had no idea where Monrovia even was— but from a simple google search I was led to your location, and I would never buy from anyone else again now that I met these wonderful people. The car is great, but the people you have there ARE WORTH MORE. priceless really. Abby, Yohanna and Robert are the most amazing hard working team I’ve ever met in the car industry! Please let them know! I truly wish everyone had the 360 degree turn around experience I had, Walked in crying in the morning, walked out a new car owner, in happy tears. Everyone deserves their level of professionalism and hard work and commitment to sales, finance and management. Thank you so very much MINI of Monrovia!<//Review>

<Text>I couldn't wait to get into my new Mini. Those little cars are so cute and they're made by BMW - must be of good quality, or so I thought.
All the cars come with leather interiors and then there's the option for those sharp looking black enamel spoke wheels.  I ended up getting the Clubman model - it's more spacious than the Cooper and the ride is smoother.  I was happy with my little car ... for about 4 1/2 months, when it needed a brake pad replacement and, as it turned out, a front wheel alignment as well.
Not quite 6 months later, the brake pads needed replacement for the second time .... this is what I have to look forward to ??  I'm so regretful that I didn't go back to Honda - never had problems with those cars.
Honestly, in all my years of driving any make, style, used or new car,  I never had to have the brake pads replaced even once in less than a year.
When I questioned the service manager about the brake pads needing replacement so soon and so frequently, the answer I got was,
"Well, they're a sportier car so the brake pads tend to be a little softer."
Ok ... whatever.
I was also asked:
"Do you drive in a lot of stop and go traffic ?"
Really ??  (this is Los Angeles) Nah, not much.
I'm sorry but brake pads are absolutely essential for the safety of the driver, the passengers and, everyone else on the road.  How does a big name car manufacturer skimp on something as vital as brake pads and be okay with it ??
But if you're really bent on investing in one of those cute little Minis - PLEASE ! buy the extended warranty ... you're gonna need it !< /Text><rating>1< /rating>< user_name>

I never do this and write a review.  But has such good customer service I felt compelled too. Came to buy a BMW for a present. Arrived and within the first few minutes a gentleman named, "Charlie Lu" came up to ask if I needed help, and not in a manner like other car salesman, he was very approachable, and knowledgeable. Went above and beyond helping me, even when I lost me keys he drove me to help me find it. Best customer service ever.  I know there are car salesman that tell you to give them a good rating after you purchase a car, but he never even mentioned it. All excellent customer service.  Thanks again Charlie for everything! I will be coming back to purchase again because of him!< /text>

<text>I would have to say, that overall, it was a fantastic experience.  No one can say that they love to bring their car in for service, but they made it super easy. The only somewhat disappointing thing I would say is that they didn't have a loaner car, but, they did give me a ride home.  What I thought was really awesome was that I kept getting text updates during the process of my car being repaired, and after everything was done, I was able to pay for my service ,online, prior to picking up the car.</text>< pics>

This was a great buying experience.
Tony, our salesman, was very knowledgeable and very courteous throughout  the whole process.
Their entire team made us feel comfortable and we left feeling we got the car we wanted (X5) at a good deal.

Just had my Bmw serviced and I couldn’t be more pleased with my rep Greg Hernandez. It’s always nice to see his smiling face and I really appreciate his ability to make my experience 5 star each time I visit. The shuttle driver was cool and the cashiers were also friendly and helpful. See y’all next time 😁</review>

<review>I needed a side mirror cover.  I was quoted $72 over the phone by George.  I arrived 35 minutes later to pick it up.  The price was now $90 and the parts guy claimed there was no George there.  Kinda funny since the cashier knew George.  It will be Nick Alexander Mini from now on.< /review><user_name>LISA TERRY<//user_name>< Rating>

I was really impressed with MINI of Monrovia. Despite being understaffed, they were able to get my car checked-in and get me in a loaner vehicle in under 40 minutes. I have had less than stellar experiences here in years past, but am so grateful they have made the necessary changes to make customer service a priority. Worked with Jason who was very communicative and informative. Grateful for the text updates and that I could approve services via text while at work. Will definitely return and ask for Jason again!< /Text>

The good:  I got the car I wanted and the financing worked out for me

The not so good:  I was irritated with my salesperson Leo on a number of occasions, primarily when I told him that I still owed on the car I was trading in, his response was "What?!" That was extremely rude and uncalled for.  Then, he told me he was going to have my car charging (i3) while I waited almost THREE hours to sign financing paperwork.  And of course for whatever reason the car was still not fully charged.  I would not rate his customer service skills highly at all.<//Text>

I'm always treated like family at MINI of Monrovia.  Robert is very friendly but thorough. He made sure that an appointment was made to get a loaner.  I like that I got a call and a text with information needed to expedite my car pick up, like a link was given so that I could pay early so all would be needed was to check in.  I called 45 minutes before pick up,  and my car was presented to me sparkling clean inside and out. Kudos to the staff at MINI of Monrovia for always maintaining a friendly and professional service.

I would highly reccomend visiting Mini of Monrovia, I had much a better experience there than I had at other Mini dealerships around our area.
Josh Tsiu was amazing, I went there for a specific car they had posted online and I can say that he went above and beyond to make sure we went home with the car I wanted. We had the pleasure of working with Youhanna also and both teamed up to guarantee we’d get the best deal and customer service possible. Driving all the way over there was 100% worth it!
Kudos to both of you for your hard work and great customer service skills, it was very nice to meet you guys.
Thank you< /text>

Leon Levy, the Sales Advisor was very knowledgeable about the product and was very eager to assist us in selecting the correct vehicle for our needs.  He was very patient and made sure we were satisfied with the purchase and the knowledge transfer prior to driving off with the vehicle.  We will definitely work with Leon again when the current lease is up on my VW later this year.  I had a somewhat negative/frustrating experience with the Sales Manager (don't recall his name) when attempting to retrieve my credit report.  It was more complicated than when I purchased my home.  In contrast, I had a great experience working with the Finance Manager, Malcolm Dougan.  He was extremely accommodating, very thorough, and was able to match our Credit Union interest rate which led us to stay with BMW financing.   Not only that, but he was able offer us additional protection for our vehicle at a discounted rate.  I highly recommend both Leon and Malcolm.</Text>

Appointment scheduling couldn't be easier! Although I think calling might be better if you know you're going to need a loaner because the option wasn't there online (but I got REALLY REALLY lucky when I took my car in early on a Thursday morning). Parkson and Cynthia were great - professional, friendly, and very courteous! Great service!</Review>

My mother and I had a pleasure working with Tomas for a new BMW!
It was about three years ago where my mother first came here for a surprise for myself where she was helped out by Tomas and Amber!
Three years later.. we came back again to lease a new one on my own!
Tomas not only provides impeccable service but he also respects and treats you as family.
My parents enjoyed him on the first visit and it is why we decided to continue to stick to BMW Monrovia.
We've dealt with countless of dealers through the past from other BMW, Land Rover, Toyota, Honda and so on and so forth but no one treats us with great amount of respect unlike Tomas.
He's always on the go, continually texts, updates you as well as does what he can on his part to make you happy and satisfied.
He really does go above and beyond for his customers!
As many know, kindness is always key to any kind of sales... and my family assures you, Tomas has it all!
He is very passionate about what he does and unlike most people, he genuinely cares for his customers.
To my parents and I, theres nothing more we can ask for!
We will continue to be loyal to the BMW Monrovia and to Tomas!
He will always be like family to us!
His humility and accountability really is everything!
Thank you again BMW Monrovia but thank you Mr. Tomas Cervantes!
We are truly grateful for you!<//text>

She was friendly, courteous and professional. I live in Fresno so I spoke to Jason Rangsipat in advance of my appointment to be sure that the parts needed for the recalls would be available. He was also very professional and courteous. He checked the inventory and reserved the parts that were needed. When I arrived I was greeted immediately and the whole process went smoothly. The driver who took me to my sisters house was wonderful, as well. I wish I could recall his name! Overall, it was the best experience that I have ever had in a service department. I love the ability to pay in advance of pickup. I have the option of going to the dealership in Pleasanton but based on my experience I will return to Monrovia!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I took my mini in for brake pads, while dropping off my car, I was informed that my car had an additional issue that was listed for recall. I automatically assumed this might cause additional finacial issues and the possibility that I would be without means of transportation for a while. Parkman was my service rep and he was fantastic, genuinely polite, professional and ensured that I would not be without a car, not only did fix all issues, but ensured it was repaired very quickly! I was very happy with this visit and the service provided, for this has not been my experience in my past visits. Great job Parkman</text>

Did not hAve an appointment but had a tire emergency. I was see in less than 15 minutes transported to a hospital where my wife was getting a test. In less than two hours my car was done and I was picked up at the hospital and brought back to pick up my car.! The attention by Ryan Thay was fantastic. Best treatment at this BMW. And any dealership  with whom I have dealt</Review>

Its been some time since I've felt like a valued customer at Mini of Monrovia. Its never fun when dealing with the stress of some major car issues like a failing transmission, but I have to say this last trip in was absolutely the best and the customer service reminded me of why I stay with MINI Cooper Monrovia. Parkson and Keven really took care of me and my Mini,  they kept me updated with cost of service progress/estimated completion time, and no wait for a rental car.  THIS is why i stay with Mini Cooper! Not only an amazing  car but amazing staff!< /Review>

They are great there! Salesman was not pushy at all, very friendly. When he turned it over to finance office, he was not pushy either. They washed my car and had someone go over all features in the car. I went back two weeks later to get another complimentary car wash and last minute questions. If your planning on getting a mini go there, they have some good deals and many to pick from.</review>

<review>I have bought two Mini Coopers from Monrovia and I liked them the best because there was no pressure to buy a car and I got the best deal.  The service is friendly and one feels comfortable there.  The Service Department is well organized and there is a comfortable waiting area that furnishes popcorn, tea, water, coffee, T.V. and cell phone charging.  The restrooms are clean.<//review>< Rating>

Extremely accommodating with customer needs.

<review>Went to Mini of Monrovia for some scheduled maintenance.  I informed my service coordinator, Jason, of an issue that was separate from the maintenance.  The issue was outside of warranty and the part that needed to be replaced was not sold separately; it was part of a bigger unit.  Jason spoke to the service manager and he approved to replace the defective part at no cost to me.  I offered to pay something, but they comp'd it.  This isn't the first time that they have exceeded my expectations.  Great people who understand great customer service and the big picture.  Highly recommended.</review>< user_id>

BMW of Monrovia is a beautiful facility which has a great layout in the service department where you basically drive into the building right up to to service representatives kiosks.
Tim Chen has been my service rep there for 6 years since i bought my 2009 328i. Tim keeps me updated on the vehicle status when I take in service or any warranty/recall work. I would probably go with another dealership or a private mechanic if it weren't for Tim.</Text>

Robert provided me with excellent customer service as usual.  He is friendly, considerate, and takes the time to ensure that all of my questions and concerns are addressed.  He does not talk down to me because I am a female (which I have experienced elsewhere before) and I really appreciate that.  On this occasion, my vehicle was done early.  Although I was unable to pick it up until the end of the day, Robert was there to greet me and send me on my merry way.  Needless to say, I highly recommend MINI of Monrovia's service department!</Review>

I'm a widow and not great at assessing some of the less obvious maintenance needs so rely on the initiative and conscientiousness of the technician and service advisor. I have not been disappointed. Yesterday the technician, Tim, identified an issue with my steering that I hadn't noticed, but realized it happened from my "meet up" with a high curb some six months ago! This adds value to the service for me and I was pleased. While I was there, I spoke to Brian in Sales about my next lease and was presented with some options from which to make a decision in about 6 months--for another Countryman. It was very helpful and appreciated.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Don't be spontaneous at Mini of Monrovia pick another dealer. I will not be coming back here. As a professional I look for quality and people to stand up to there word. They convinced me to make a deposit to I could order the 4 door I needed and assured me they would take care of my current mini since it was financed through them. No problem since repeat customer. Had to put down a $2k deposit but assured me refundable. I come in today my sales person was promoted so dumped on someone else who knew nothing about anything discussed. Now I have to pay over $4k for them to take my trade in plus money for the car. So upset never would have done this was working to lower my payment with a lease. Just asked for my deposit back on my card they refused and said couldn't run transaction today but I know they can they ran my card on a Sunday!! So illegal.

they did an amazing job fixing my car!!! I would highly recommend them to anyone that needs service or anything done to your car! This dealer provides excellent customer service and will go above and beyond to better satisfy you as a customer. I had Parkson and Rudy help me and they are amazing!! I really appreciated the service they provided me.< /Text>

< Review>
Very happy with the service THIS TIME. In the past, routine scheduled maintenance has taken in excess of 10 hours and in one instance, my car was never worked on after 12 hours.

This time was different. My service rep was great and promised the car back in about two hours. I was very sceptical and in all honesty figured my car wouldn't be ready for several hours. About two hours later I received a call that my car ready,

If this new trend continues, I'll be a happy and returning customer.< /Review>

I brought my car in last week for a check-up regarding a rattling noise I heard upon initial acceleration, however, as that concern was undetectable to the service department, I was instead informed of a different problem. It was reported to me that my car was leaking coolant as a result of a broken thermostat that was to manage the engine's internal temperatures. I consented for the repairs and was able to pick up my car a few days later. However, now I find my car to be visibly leaking fluid, and I am guessing that my car is experiencing the same problem that was should have been corrected. I am waiting to hear back from the service department regarding the issue. I know it is a business, however, I pay enough money for my car, not to be given the run around or false promises for the quality of servicing that should be provided upon initial consult.<//text>

I really like working with my advisor Matt but when it came to picking up my car my car was very dirty you can see the fingerprints where they were working on it they tried washing it but all they did was leave water stains on my mirrors and windows yet you can still see the fingerprints , other than that I would have given it a five-star it's the second time that they return my car dirty< /Review>

I had a great experience (once again) at this shop. I thought my countryman was licking because I saw oil on the ground where my mini was parked. But the shop said my mini was fine after they ran several tests (thanks God for that although I still couldn't figure out where the oil came from).  Cindy was very nice and she arranged a temperory car for me while my car was at service. Overall I am very satisfied with this shop.</review>

Took my Mini Clubman in for a routine oil change and other included maintenance.  I was greeted at the car by an associate who immediately took care of the sign in paperwork and promised the car would be completed within 4 hours.  The car was finished in 3 hours and was washed when I picked it up.  Great customer service!</Text>

<Review>Had my clutch repaired under my extended maintenance plan. Clutch moves like a hot knife through butter now. When i took the car in, they drove the car, agreed that it was not acting normal. Supplied me with a loaner for 3 days. No problem.  Damage came from the previous owner that probably never learned how to truly drive a manual transmission.  My only beef is that its a CPO car when I bought it 5 months ago and it clutch has felt that way since I owned it, and it wasn't till i drove my older brothers new mini that I could tell mine was not performing properly. You would think during the however many point inspection they would be able to detect this issue before selling it as a CPO vehicle. Had I not gotten the extended plan I wonder if they would have covered the cost of the repair. guess we will never find out.   MOTOR ON!<//Review>< rate>

<date>1478832393181</date><Rating>5</Rating><review>Mini of Morovia's Service Department has definitely improved!  I remember when I purchased my Mini from them in June of 2012.  There was a customer walking around looking for someone in the service department, and someone in sales ended up helping her.  Now that the service department has been renovated, it is very easy to find someone.  There's usually at least one person in the service department.  They told my husband that he might have to pay for the diagnostic test.  We were happy to find out that the thermostat was covered under the California Emissions Warranty, and that we would not have to pay for the diagnostic test.  They even washed the car.  That saves my husband from paying to have the car washed.  THANK YOU MINI OF MONROVIA!!!!!...</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Although I live in the San Fernando valley, I only come to Mini of Monrovia because they actually treat their costumers with respect. Always happy with their service. A huge thank you to Jason R!< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Had a great experience at the MINI of Monrovia. We had decided to go for a Mini Cooper hardtop and went to the Monrovia showroom hoping just to have a look and come back later,and we met Brian, who helped us not only go through the different models but also helping us with the pricing and lease options to finally decide to buy one the same day! He was pretty quick and customer focussed and got all the paperwork done smoothly. We got the car ready for pick up the very next day once we were ready with the insurance. Great place to shop your MINI!< /Text>< Pics>

<text>I’ve been to every BMW dealer in the Valley including Glendale and by far this has been my best experience. Ryan Thay in service has been the most helpful and friendly service adivsor I’ve had throughout my 5+ years of BMW service. Ryan helped me get my transmission and motor replaced when there was unknown issues in a matter of 2 weeks! Now my experience with other places has been so bad to a point where I’ve beem denied service and repairs before for unknown reasons. God bless this man🙏</text>< Date>

Always a great service experience.  As always, the labor costs for some of the work is very expensive and you would be better served if you can find a reputable shop to do your maintenance after the initial 2 years.<//review>

Slow service and no timely response or updates. Unfriendly staff.

They took a week to replace the tires and two wheels and did not provide a loaner vehicle. After that they sent me an email saying the car is ready for pick up. When I arrived they were refusing to give me my vehicle until the check from the insurance arrived. It was poor communication for them to send me an email and then have me arrive at their dealership to refuse my vehicle for a check that was being sent from one of the top insurance companies in the nation.
I had to pay for the service at the dealership to get my car and have the insurance forward the check to me. They do not value their customers time or satisfaction.< /text>

<text>From the moment I scheduled my car service to when I picked up my car, I received by far the best service compare to another Mini Cooper Dealership in Ontario. I had the pleasure of working with Parkson Yee and he was very helpful, courteous, explained every step of the process, and provided a shuttle transportation for me. I would recommend Mini Cooper Monrovia.< /text><rating>5</rating></record>

<Text>Came at 7 after I got off work. Was in traffic for an Hour. Was literally empty except for three employees sitting around in an office. They took one look at me and went back to chatting something up. I was deciding between a Lexus CT and Mini Cooper s. Called my local Lexus dealer and got the CT because some guys decided gossip was more important that helping another brother out. Disappointed!!!!<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Bad scheduling. scheduled service and repair for my vehicle. Told the lady in service department that i needed a loaner car because i had a full day scheduled and was not going to have time to pick up the car. She would not accommodate me even though I told her that was the only day of the week i would be able to take the car in. Not feeling valued customer. Five stars for sales 1 star for scheduling.
Called Mini dealer of Downtown LA and they took care of me :)< /Review>

< Review>
I've been taking my convirtable for service to Mini of Monrovia since I've purchased it. In the past I've taken my mini to a dealer much closer to my house but have gotten diagnostics that I did not need and had I trusted them I would of spend ton of money. The mechanics are very honest at Mini of Monrovia and the advisor works with you to give you the best pricing. In few occasions my advisor has worked with the mini headquarters and eliminated paying a dime for my services.
They are my go to dealership😊< /Review>

<resp>None</resp><Review>I purchased a used 2015 Mini Cooper 2 door hardtop and Javier Escalante, Motoring Advisor, helped me to find the Mini I liked. He is a super warm and friendly person. However, I didn't like this place first time when I walked into the store because no one was welcoming me, in fact, i stood up there for about 10min. All of the workers were just ignore, seriously. But, Javier helped me to find my Mini, he is really knowledgeable about everything. Whenever I needed to know something, because it was a used car so I need to be careful about buying a car, he let me know everything I needed. I became a friend with him. So, if you think about buying a Mini, I highly recommend to get your Mini with Javier Escalante.</Review><user_id>114967439258997820322< /user_id></record>

I made an appointment for an oil change at 10AM. I wasn't seen by a service advisor until 10:30. I was then told the oil change would take 2 hours. I didn't get out of there until 12:30. A simple oil change shouldn't take so long.<//text>

the Cashier is not friendly at all!  I can tell she is on her cell and texting so I let her finish up before approaching her.  Gunnies looked up with an mad face and said, “ your last name?”
Then follow by “this is your receipt and sign this copy.”  Did I offended her by interrupting her personal text during work hour?
This three starts are for the crew service members not her.<//text>

Used to get my Mini serviced where are purchased the car, but wasn't happy with the service I received from the service department, so I tried Mini of Monrovia. I'm really happy I made the switch as they took the time to talk to me and inform me as to what services were performed and their observations about the car.<//Review>

My car was due for an oil change and they asked if I wanted a complimentary car wash. I said yes (i should’ve declined). My car came out of the wash and there was big scratch on the front left bumper. They even scratched my headlights. The guy said that he would buff out the scratches for me and after buffing, there were still a few scratches. Never accepting a car wash from them again.</review>

Moutaz really help me buy the car I wanted with all of the features that I needed. He showed me everything option that was in stock and he was very professional and not 1 second he pussed me into anything I did not want . My idea was to get a 2015 BMW X1 msport , but at the end of the day I got a really good deal on a 2018 BMW X1 with the luxury package . My wife and I are really happy that we found Moutaz at the Monrovia bmw dealer(sonic). The best part that Moutaz offered me was the warranty packages and maintaince plans they offer . I really enjoy my hassle free purchase with Moutaz. I would highly recommend him if your looking to purchase a car here !!<//Review>

<Date>1502832488543</Date><Review>Got a new car but it was dented.

I just want to share my story because we need to be careful when we buy a new car.

It was 3rd times mini, and 2nd times from Monrovia mini. I like mini and this place but not sure from now.
I found the dent after a month later from the purchasing. Actually, my neighbor found it and he said he found a dent 2~3 days later from the new car came.

I tried to looking for all the photos but there were nothing for the car.
But I google the vin number and I found the car listing photos.
And I found the photo with dented part!

I was so embarrassed. I thought it was made by accident but it was from the dealer.

Next day, I stop by the dealer with that photo.
First, I ask them to show me anything about that but there were nothing.
Record, photo, video anything.
Sales people, manager, general manager came to me and they said it is impossible.

I ask them to check the original photo,  maybe the photographer has it.

And from there, they found the photo with the dent and they fix the car.

It was hard time.
I spend my whole weekend (with all my family),  drive 2 time go and back, around 50 minutes foe each, trying to search the photo and looking for the specialist who can fix my car for another day, stressful night for a week.

Last weekend, repairman was came to my house.
He spent 4~5 hours to fix that part.
It looks clear now but we know it was dented before.

When the time for buying a new car, we need to check the car inch by inch before leaving the dealer.

Thank you for reading.< /Review><UserId.>100587207058561686056</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80c2d909325926bd:0x82e7b2e529d9a10<//Gmap_id><user_name>Hyeongmin Oh</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Completely obnoxious parts desk here.  Needed a mini part with a MINI MSRP of $40, these guys want $78.  Called Mini of Universal City, $44.  Take your business elsewhere, Mini of Monrovia is just out to rip you off.

Also, if you try to make a warranty service appointment with them, they refuse to reserve a loaner car for you, they'll only give you a loaner "if we still have one available when you drop your car off."</Text>

Unfortunately the AC went out after 5 days of owning the car. The no assurance policy and lack of 30 day warranty is a big issue and made the car even more expensive. It doesn't matter that the car was purchased at a car dealer. Next time will buy a certified from Honda dealer--lesson learned.<//review>

<text>Sold my car to this dealership and received horrible service. Was lied to repeatedly about receiving my pay off and then was treated like a two year old when discussing what would occur, repeatedly referred to as "hun" when I made sure to tell them they had lied about the steps of selling this car. Terrible experience and do not recommend to anyone looking to sell their car.</text>< name>

<rating>5</rating><text>I originally purchased my Mini from Carmax. I brought my car in to the Monrovia Mini service center to have my car's software updated within the same week of purchase. Since my first service, my adviser Parkson has been nothing short of AMAZING. He makes sure to update me about upcoming services covered under my warranty and allows me to babble his ears off about possible concerns and things I would like checked. He is always patient and happy to help. He makes me want to continue to purchase Minis so that I can continue to experience great customer service through him. When informing his supervisor Rudy of his performance - Rudy was just as hospitable and friendly! It feels great to not dread bringing your car in to get service. They are quick and their waiting area is always clean and inviting. Thanks Parkson and Rudy!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Absolutely the best experience I have had so far! Larry was my advisor and he made sure that everything I asked for was taken care of and then some. I came in with a list of services to be taken care of as well as some extras that I was curious about pricing for. I was very happy with the quote he gave me to get absolutely everything done, and then he even managed to make the final numbers come out just a bit cheaper than that! On top of it all, one of the services he recommended ended up fixing a problem that nobody else could figure out! Thank you Larry!!! I will definitely be coming back and requesting you as my advisor for the life of my car!<//Text>

My Mini Clubman was way overdue for service. Unfortunately, unlike many newer cars, Mini's don't do a very good job of letting you know when they need service. When I realized I was overdue, I stopped in at Mini of Monrovia, since it's very close to my work. They were awesome!
They got me right in, serviced my vehicle, made arrangements to deal with a couple additional issues on a future visit, and sent me on my way in less than two hours. Everyone was very friendly, knowledgeable, and hospitable.
Since I'm moving to the area, I'm really pleased to know I've got a great dealer nearby whom I can trust to take great care of my Mini!<//review>

I would not be giving this last experience I had a 1 star, but I have given Mini of Monrovia multiple chances to change my mind. My previous visits have been less than satisfactory as I was kept waiting while no service advisor greeted me or asked how they could assist me. i was kept waiting while my vehicle sat finished in the driveway.

This review is for my last visit on 2.3.17. I hate long reviews so I will get to the point:
1. booked a loaner 5 days in advance, as they suggested, but they were all booked out for a week. I wasn't notified till the day before my appointment.
2. my vehicle service was completed at 10a.m. I wasn't able to pick it up until 3:00 p.m....why?
3. I wasn't notified of my vehicles completion until I personally called into to check on its status.
4. when i came in to pick up my vehicle, the paper work for its completion wasn't even ready. They could not find my information.
5. I had to complain to the manager but he was of no help. All he did was make excuses. Didn't compensate me for my lost time or my terrible experience.

I would not go back to this dealership if I had another options. unfortunately, I paid a lot of money for their "extended warranty service plan" and so far all I've received is a few oil changes and wiper blade replacements. And a whole lot of wasted time. I am forced to bring my car to the dealership until this outrageous service plan expires.< /review>

<Text>The service department was friendly and took care of my mini a 2011 R56 mini convertible.

The car had issues like the plastic water pump leaking, thermostat housing error codes, power window and blinker computer failure, all of which were taken care under extended warranty.

these 2007 -2013 r56 minis are problematic hoever the frindly and helpful staff at Mini of Monrovia will do their utmost to help you out.

Many thanks,</Text>< pics>

seemingly faulty part was a recall until 2011, i have a 2012 mini cooper, the wire caught on fire, they wanted $167. for diagnostics PLUS $935. for faulty cooler pump. i took it else where, they fixed it for $250. REALLY disappointing and sad. i will never trust that dealership again.<//text>

I was looking for a Certified Mini Cooper with my sister the other day. The person who assisted me was friendly and everything seemed ok. Apart from that the cars weren’t what I was expecting. Most of their certified cars are dented or have some sort of damage that isn't easily repaired and would cost more than $500 to fix.

But that’s not all... Today, I received a text message from Javier of Mini Monrovia in Spanish. I never spoke to them in Spanish. I never identified myself as a Spanish speaker. And, I never discussed my personal life or my birth place with them. Yet, today I was racially profiled by Mini of Monrovia. They “assumed” that I speak Spanish.

I do don’t get me wrong. I am proud of being Bilingual.

However, I didn’t gave them my consent to speak to me or to “assume” that I speak Spanish. They just bluntly racially profiled me.

Therefore, I don’t think they should earn anyone’s business. They might treat you with respect in front of you. But behind your back they might racially profile you.

They apologized, but the fact that they did racially profile me is unacceptable!

As for referrence: I am a light skin Puerto Rican. Also, I am currently studying in one of the top universities in the Los Angeles area, USC without financial aid.

They just "assumed" that I spoke Spanish. Today, you cannot "assume" for the pleasure of gaining a negotation that as of today they won't earn. Also, my friends already know and they are disgusted by the dealership's assumption. One of them is actually a current customer of Mini of Monrovia.... FYI His dad won't be buying any cars from them again, and he told his colleagues who are also customers of the dealership. They know me personally. FYI They won't buy any cars from them again.

It's so unfortunate that Mini of Monrovia has to "assume" when trying to earn someone's business. They surely don't know how to treat a customer.< /review>

< review>
The worst maintenance service I ever have. I dropped off my MINI 2016 for oil change on Jan 20th. Waited there about a whole morning on Friday and turned out they tell me: one of their technicians hit my rear bumper!! My service supervisor, Cindy, didn't let me know the reason why they hit my car, and even an apology!!!
I was like, seriously?! Even myself didn't ever make a tiny crash on my car and one of your technicians hit it and no apologies?? So ridiculous!

Then of course, they said they gonna fix that for me and rent me a car for free during the period. So I came in on the next Saturday Jan28 to get it fix. They said it would take about 2-3 days to reprint my car and my car would be ready for sure before the next Saturday Feb04.
However, I called them twice for my car status and they finally told me my car is ready when I contacted them on Feb08, 10days after I dropped off my car!!! And again, I talked to Cindy again and she said I could pick up my car either Thursday or Friday. Since I'm working at downtown and off at 6pm, I told them I couldn't arrive before 7pm and she told me that's ok and she would get everything ready when I was there even she's not working on Thursday...

And here is Thursday February 09, I got there on 7:10, service department already closed. Since Cindy was off and one of the other supervisor took care of me, said they don't have my key and didn't even know I'm coming!!!! My key was locked in back and no one except the manager has the key!!!
I was like: are you freaking kidding me????
Then why you told me my car is ready??? Why you told me I could pick up whenever I like??
I just looking at my own car in front of me and DON'T have the key!!!!! Do you have that silly thing ever????

Well, then the other service supervisor( jorsh? or George?) asked me to come back tomorrow so he would drop my car in front to the sales department. Really?! Drive from downtown to Monrovia again??? On Friday night??! "Great idea "!!!!

Well, it's 20:30 on February 09, and I wish I could get my car back tomorrow!
And I wish I could rate it 0 star for your service!!!< /review>

<review>This is the worst service experience I have had out of 4 or 5 MINI dealerships I have taken my MINI to for servicing. My contact was Anthony and I was given a loaner car, as requested.
1. Checking in went fine. Driving my car right up to the service door was odd because the parking lot was cramped. I squeezed my MINI through the cars no problem, but a larger vehicle definitely would not have made it through.
2. They charged a $500 diagnosing fee right off the bat.
3. After checking in, I waited almost an hour for the loaner car. That has never happened at other dealerships.
4. After getting home, which is a 45 minute drive, I called to have my husband added as a driver to the loaner car. The first answer I got was that we had to come back in to let them photo copy his driver's license. Sending it over email was not an option. I called the car loan person directly to confirm this and left a detailed message, asking her to call back. In the meantime, we made the 45 minute drive, rushing to make it before their closing time. When we get there, the car loan person was sitting right at her desk. Apparently, as long as my husband is on the same insurance, we were fine. We did not have to provide them with his driver's license. Well, thanks for not calling me back to let me know.
5. I provided Anthony with a quote from Firestone for suggested repairs. The prices he gave me the next day were considerably pricier than the Firestone quotes, which I suppose is a given since this is a MINI dealership. They did not even attempt to match Firestone's quote.
6. There is a class action lawsuit regarding known defects in the transmission. Basically they sold the cars knowing the transmission was faulty. But the dealership would only replace my "internal failure" transmission if I paid almost $11k. My car is not even worth that anymore.
7. We are now in the market for a new car which will NOT be a MINI or BMW.<//review>< pics>

NEVER TAKE YOUR CAR TO GET SERVICED HERE!! I don't ever write reviews but this is something i definitely need to review about. I made an appt to get my cousin's car diagnosed and they told me the fee is 160$ to figure out why the check engine light is on. Waited 2hrs and they sent me home, later that afternoon they texted me saying they need an additional $500 to proceed with the diagnostic. If i didn't agree to proceed then I still owe the $160 for ABSOLUTELY nothing. (since I won't know why the check engine light is on.) The service manager Rudy said it was a practice for all Mini dealerships. They then quoted me $10,500 for the repairs which is nearly half a brand new Mini. LOL!!!! Anyways, after complaining they knocked it down to $432.00  They said that they need to pay the technicians, they all on hrly rate anyways.</Review>

Took my MiNi in for a simple oil change and I'm completely sartisfied. They also rain a diagnostic and it came up with some recommendations but was not pressured into getting them done. I really appreciate Patrick Kennedys professionalism at service, and will be back to get some of the other things done when My budget will allow it.< /Review>

George Elray and Yahia Zabde are just OUTSTANDING when it comes to customer service and providing a fair deal. This is my 2nd Mini Cooper S and I love the Monrovia Mini Cooper Dealership. They ALWAYS go above and beyond to match me with the exact car that I want.
Mo Younis is the GM and he even made time to chat with me. This dealership absolutely gives WOW service.
Keep up the great work guys!< /Text>

<review>Amazing amazing amazing.
Recommended to me by my dad since he had such a good experience as well, both of the times he got his car here.

We came at about 8:45 PM and they close at 9:00 PM. But my dad remembered George, one of the top rated salesman in the nation. And when he called George late at night around 7:30 PM, George was absolutely ready to help us get a new car.

George's friendliness and courtesy is beyond exceptional. He really cares about his customers. It isn't just about money or selling cars. He makes you want to recommend everyone else you know to this dealership to be helped by him.

By the time we got there around 8:45, there was only about 4 people left on the site since most people had gone home.

I test drove my potential 2014 MINI that George had ready for me, as we had told him what I wanted over the phone before we came, I went up stairs to sign papers, and unpacked some things from my old car into the new car and then we were out in only 20 mins after I unpacked. I headed home around 11:00.

George made the experience welcoming and extremely quick, given my experience going to previous dealers with my parents when I was young and it took the whole day back then practically.

My experience was such a contrast to what I was used to and maybe what others are used to as well.

Overall: Anyone looking for a MINI Cooper or BMW need not worry about this place if they're hesitant, your experience will be great.

And if I haven't recommended him enough yet (lol): George is your goto man for being helped with your new car.

Neil, his assistant, is also very kind and helpful. You'll appreciate his assistance!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Mini of Monrovia was a great experience all around. Starting with our Salesman Javier. He was very knowledgeable on all the minis and bmws. He took us on 4 or 5 test drives till he and my husband found me my Perfect Mini! Javier was very knowledgeable, kind and patient. He walked us through from start to finish. He feels like part of the fam now lol.
Then there was Taja. He was our Mini specialist who comes to walk you around the car and teaches you everything there is to know about our New 2018 4 door mini hardtop. He did a great job. I feel like I know all there is to know now about my new Mini. This car rocks!  We found out very quickly that Taja loved babies too. He was so sweet with our 16 month old daughter Gracie Anne. She loved him by the end of the day!  He even brought her a brand new teddy bear, from the Bmw side!!! So nice!
Also, thank you Yahia! Minis Manager. He was great as well. He was very accommodating.
Thank you Joe! Finance Guy! He was very personable and not too pressing. He helped us choose what options were truely needed at signing.
If you need tinting or stripe work done on your mini, ask for Rolando there :)
“Thank you Mini of Monrovia”
First time Mini Owners: Cathy, Cory & Gracie Anne.
5 stars all day!
Thanks guys!

Not even worth a star, but, it is for those of people who helped me out yesterday. Worst experience ever because of a dealer. 9 hours to get a car, my dealer doesn’t have any responsibilities, 4 months to get registation sticker although they knew that they got it from dmv (I called and asked to dealer for 4 months and just got it from someone else)< /Text>

I haven't gone to a car dealership in a while and I was very hesitant to, BUT I'm so glad I went to Mini Cooper of Monrovia and met Yahia and Jenny. They made the whole car-buying experience SO easy. I hate the hassle and the hard balling and negotiation. Yahia and Jenny gave it to me straight and were so informative. I told them what I was looking for from car to budget, and they were able to make it work for me. They didn't have the color I wanted on the Monrovia lot, and Jenny went all the way down to Escondido to pick it up. They were really responsive on email and text. I still talk to them now and feel comfortable asking them questions.</Text>

<Review>Awful, awful, awful. If there was a category for no stars I would have used that. The first time I presented my car they sent me away with a check engine light still on although I had pointed this out to one of the workers she said it was an airbag light! go figure. Then  the first  night my car was there they called me and said there was a loaner car but when I returned in the morning for the loaner car no one knew anything about this mysterious message only asked later by another worker, " why didn't you pick up your loaner car we had reserved for you?" to which of course I couldn't even respond I was so irritated, so 3 days later and 3 days of rental car later I'm slapped with a nearly $600 bill although I have an extended warrenty on my car. The manager was supposed to call me at my request.....never heard from him and the person responsible for calling me about my car when it was ready didn't call me, I got sent an e-mail! When I complained they asked if I wanted to speak to a manager, why on earth would I want to do that? all they do is apologise for all their mistakes here but never improve. The car I have is a Countryman and it is five and a half years old. It already has had a new $13,000 engine dropped in it at their expense as last time I brought my car in for servic the engine seized because whatever was not done to my car during the last service resulted in their negligence and a 2 mile walk home at one o'clock in the morning because of my engine overheating. Robert a recently retired service manager and John Slater have left who used to have this place happily and efficiently ticking over but with them gone it's been a nightmare here of epic proportions. I've been asked by people who stop me and ask if I like my car, I urge them to walk on by Mini of Monrovia to another dealership as I wouldn't want that responsibilty or guilt of a recommendation. This place needs some serious overhauling......you can remodel a building but that doesn't make a good business<//Review>< userid>

Well long story short, my bro and I got a (pre-owned) cooper from there and the people couldn't be cooler! they tried to get us the best deal. that is until the clutch on the car went out about three weeks later; all of a sudden all the people who we dealt with didn't know us. we took into the dealer, they said it was gonna cost us $2,500 out of our pocket to get it fixed even though we've had the car less than a month! after almost four weeks of us calling and calling... and calling and not getting an answer- or a call back for that matter- we were able to come to an agreement the ONE good person there who got us a deal to get the car fixed at an independent shop. the dealer dealer paid $500 and we had to fork out $900 out of our pocket.
they said they pride themselves in having return customers but i must say that next time im just gonna get a Nissan.
this is my third time buying a car and in the words of comic book guy: Worse car experience EVER!</text>

<rating>4</rating><Text>This is a second visit for the service department at Mini Monrovia.

My newish Clubman had a brake problem and I drove straight there. . My first visit for service at this dealership was awful about three months ago. This time, it was much different. I think the service manager from before is now gone and hopefully so.

Clarkson was by himself the day after a big holiday and he was dealing with a lot of people. Once he got to me, he quickly had the shop foreman drive my car. We went ten feet and it was apparent that my brakes were not working.

Clarkson took the order and I was on my way. Later in the afternoon I tried tracking him down and I got into voicemail hell. This is why this is 4 stars instead of 5. I then had the operator email him and he called about 15 minutes later. I then got a text from him saying that I could pick up the car.

The brakes were replaced and Clarkson was very cordial. I paid nothing and I was on my way.

Thank you Clarkson for the great service. Please get me a way to connect about my car up front next time. The text would be helpful as I leave, not later.</Text>< pics>

March 4, 2016

On this time of regular check and repair of my BMW X-3
(at BMW of Monrovia, 1425-1451 South Mountain Ave. Monrovia, CA 91016)

This time of regular check was so far good as on the return drive from the service to my house.

But this time repair was very disappointed.
Reason is that both left and right LED rear tail light housings were replaced and charged $792.75 (including labor charge but not including tax).
When I visited at the service for the regular check and the repair, I told and requested the service person to do regular check and to fix only left rear light which was not turned on.
Then, the service person phoned and explained after they checked my X-3 that left rear LED light bulb itself was not be able to be replaced. Instead, whole assemble of rear LED light housings of not only left but also of right should be replaced.
I didn’t have any choice avoid this expensive and uncomfortable repair charge.

The points which I am very unhappy are ;

(1)	This time problem is definitely part defects (or parts not reliable). Current technology of LED light bulb is very reliable and long life. And These LED light whole housings are the original ones.  Why should I pay for it?
(2)	This LED housing design was not customer oriented. Because, Customers have to replace whole housing of both left and right instead of left LED light bulb it self. Why BMW (as one of the most honorable automobile manufacturer) had designed such customer uncomfortable one?

If you have any explanation of the reason why or any excuse against my points stated above, please send me an e-mail.
Also, if you refund the charge ($792.75), I am very comfortable.  Please let me know.

However, I think they did not turn off the service light, as it remains on when I turn on the car.  The dealership is not convenient for a quick pop in.  Otherwise, just great!</Text>

<userid>101867413208550189690<//userid><text>(Translated by Google) I installed the jcw turning kit, and I want to say that Jason and everyone in the service did an excellent job, they treated me excellently, apart from the fact that the installation lasted less than what was planned. I delivered the Country Man 2018 on Friday and they delivered it to me on Friday. Saturday being that normally it should have been until Monday, the installation cost me half of what they charge me in mini Ontario. I will definitely return to mini monrovia.
Thanks again guys!
Paul
