<Review>Terrible ordering experience. They need to get their Public Announcement System fixed. I had to repeat my order 3 times and they still couldn't get it right. I wanted 2 strawberry banana milk shakes. They said they have been out of banana's for over 3 weeks. This Sonic is a block away from the local grocery store. They could have bought some the same day. We had to order something else. I waited over 15 mins for just shakes. I'm giving this a 1 star only because the shakes had quality flavor.</Review>< Pics>

Overall I think this is a 3 star restaurant, however this experience makes for a 1 star review. Every fast-food place has handed out old fries at one time or another, but this place gets the award for OLDEST fries given to a customer. The fries were so old they weren't even edible, they could not be chewed. Having previously  worked in the fastfood industry myself I know how long it takes for fries to reach this state, and that is ridiculous and unacceptible. Looks like I will be ordering my fries without salt from now on and I recommend others to do this as well, as that is the only way to guarantee fresh fries. Do better Sonic, you have lowered the bar.< /Text>

<Review>First and foremost I’d like to say the staff is very professional and trained. They were quick to give me fresh food and it didn’t take no longer than 1 minute. As compared to other fast food in Sanger, Ca I find Sonic Superior to every other place in Sanger. I’ve heard many negative things about this place in specific but this is like the Kanye West of fast food. The worker Adilene NEEDS a raise. She was very nice and had amazing costumer service. My father usually comes here and says people are rude but it’s a complete LIE. Best Slushes in town keep doing what you’re doing. ❤️<//Review>< userid>

I always tell myself never to go back yet I do in hopes staff and the way things flow has changed. 3 years later it has not! Staff is ok but not super friendly. They don't do the half priced shakes after 8. Which was the only reason to go there in the first place. Not sure how they are still open.</Review>

Came to pick up an online order (not the first time), parked in a stall checked in waited for about 15 min and hit red button again to check status of order and employee said to go through drive through window 🙄🙄. Now i have been waiting for 40 min in drive through for a lemonade! while there's other cars in the stalls getting their online orders taken to the car. Slowest Sonic ever. All employees looked lost af and overwhelmed. Probably not ordering from this Sonic for a while.</text>

Waited over 15 minutes for 1 shake. I ordered on line, parked in a stall and checked in , gave up and went through the drive thru. What's the point of online ordering if you have to wait anyway. Disappointing, this Sonic has was great when it opened. What happened?!<//Review>

If you get the app you're able to enjoy discounts and it makes the wait short. Otherwise you have to deal with extended wait times. Get the app, trust me.<//text>

I went there with my kids and order a meal chicken strips and tater tots and 2 mini milkshakes. I didn't like the fact that I have to wait for the chicken strips and after all when they give them to me they were too dry. I wouldn't go back on my behalf and plus their to expensive. When I go home and feed my kids I put all the food on the table and it look like a little bit and they charged me $24. I would have gone to In-N-Out and got hooked up for cheaper too bad it was to far and my kids were hungry.<//review>

Very unknowable staff. Not very helpful, not very friendly. Very difficult to do separate orders. Cannot do half cash half card only one or the other. For the added expense we could at least receive friendliness as a constellation but nothing at all plus a long wait in the drive thru. Would not reccomend the one in Sanger.</review>

This Sonic in Sanger is the worst I have been too. I like Sonics food but every single time I go here for breakfast they get my order very wrong. I ordered a bacon breakfast bowl. Asked to make sure that she adds the onions this time because she left them out last time..... so I get a BACON breakfast bowl with onions this time but guess what.... NO BACON. Its almost comical< /text>

Overall food was good..went on Tuesday also known as "family night" nothing family about it..they should do more it's only one day out of the week. They'll probably get more customers. Surprisingly our order did not take forever like normal. Also came the other day and our shakes were melted don't know why if we were the only car in the drive thru?< /Text>

15 Boy Scouts and 5 of us Dads walked in and the cashier was not even professional enough to tell us that the guy in the kitchen, and her, were the only 2 people working there. After 25 minutes 2 orders came our way, and so we cancelled all the rest and went to Jack in The Box down the street, and ate within 20 minutes</Text>

<text>** WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO SONIC, EVER!!!! **

Store was empty, I waited in the lobby for 12 minutes before someone in the back finally took our order. After another 10 minutes we finally got our food, the boneless chicken wings were dry and hard & swimming in an excessive amount of bbq sauce, the cheese sticks were cold in the center and soaked in oil.
While sitting outside, we were chased off by a St. Bernard that wanted to pick a fight with our dog on a leash and eat the food off our table, when an employee came out side and watched my kids slush spill while the dog was trying to eat our food, she just went back inside and didn't return.
We ending up RUNNING to our car while being chased by the St. Bernard. We sat in our car for a few minutes to see if anyone would come back out or wave at us through the window but they didn't care.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x8094f8ff74aef07b:0xee66ac6f11be0d14</gmap_id></record>

When you really gear down to it the Sanger Sonic has a friendly environment with the addition of a Dine-In like no other Sonic for you to really enjoy your fast food experience! At times there is a bit of a wait on your meal/drinks but with a minimal staff they push out the orders the best way possible. A bit pricey on the food but I say worth the value at which you pay. Overall with the new staff and management the store is really coming along.</review>

< Review>
Worst customer service, I waited 5 minutes to be helped. I ordered 2 cups of cookie dough ice cream and basically got 2 half cups of vanilla ice cream with the other half being whip cream. That place went down hill fast.< /Review>

Absolutely horrendous customer service. I went there on a Friday afternoon around lunch hour. I was met by this scronny looking white girl with black hair. I pressed the red button. The interaction between us was so stale. Didn't say hello just barely acknowledged my existence. All she said was may I take your order in a very condescending tone of voice. I placed my order and she quickly walks back to her lair. Comes back with my order. Tosses it on the table cuz I had the whole place to myself. Walks away from me. Never says a word. I hardly ever rant about stuff like this but never had I felt so disrespected in my LIFE! I hope somebody reads this and puts her skinny sorry excuse of a human being in her place. Never again will I show myself at this establishment. End rant< /review>

This place was the spot every other day for me during happy hour for shake. But now it's once a month, recently I've been waiting for 20-25mins. And of top of that once I get my drinks they  have been warm melted. Two nights ago I was the only car in the stall and 3 cars I'm the drive thru and still waited 20mins to get my shakes and the usual warm melted shakes.<//Text>

Great happy hour. The only negative thing I can say, is that they seem slightly understaffed. However, if you aren't in a hurry, it's definitely worth the wait. Shakes and Blasts are off the hook! UPDATE: Went to get my wife and shake. I pulled into the drive thru at 11:31. All the lights were on and someone told me through the drive thru intercom that they were closed. I explained all I needed was a small shake  (which I don't think is a lot to ask) The employee would not budge. Very disappointing.<//review>

Don't come here unless you have 20 to 25 minutes to wait. Even for ice cream. Service is horrible. Everyone is always scrambling around like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. Worst fast food joint in town!!!</review>

< Review>
I highly recommend coming here! My fiend and I came in and got a tattoo from Mo. Mo was so nice and patient with us getting our first tattoos. I couldn’t be happier with the tattoo that I got. It was exactly what I wanted. I will be coming back for more for sure.<//Review>

<Text>Just went there May 14 and had my tattoo done with Echo. Very clean place and everyone there is welcoming and helpful. I had an appointment I made a month prior and Echo let me see the draft beforehand which was perfect.

Overall a great experience with Mo! I set up an appointment with Mo after emailing him what I wanted. When I got there I had to wait a bit for Mo to get ready and when we began the process he was very accommodating and tried the best to get the best art I wanted. We made couple adjustments and was ready to go. The session took about 5 hours and throughout the process he gave me time to take a break and grab some water in between and I was pretty happy with the result I got. Mo is a very talented artist and I recommend to everyone who is interested in getting a single needle/fine line tattoo!<//text>

<Text>My sweet grandmother passed away in late September and her favorite flower was a pink rose. I knew I wanted my first tattoo to be dedicated to her in her loving memory. I found Bojin on Instagram and was Instantly drawn to her tattooing! She does beautiful roses so I reached out to her and she gave me a warm response immediately! Bojin is such a wonderful tattooer and the cutest person ever! She designed the best tattoo for me and my arm and incorporated all the motifs I wanted in my tattoo. I can’t wait to go back!
Also this studio was so clean and professional. Each tattooer has a little stall with privacy curtains and the waiting area is comfortable. Once again, thank you Bojin and Modo Ink!! 谢谢!

Credit to @mo_tattooist! He does great work and the type of style exactly what I wanted. Made my appointment and discussed the specifics I wanted for the art. Got 2 pieces done with him, and am definitely looking forward to getting more done here with him. The place itself inside is clean as well with a larger amount of space. Mine are finally finishing healing up and still looking great,  that single needle tattoo just gives those details and thin lines an incredible look. Hard to think about going anywhere else when I'm confident that he will do a better job with the exact art I want done. Without a doubt I'll be back scheduling more in the next few months and later on in the future.< /Text>

I found Mo Chen on Instagram (mo_tattooist) and presented him with a Cupid-like piece via email. Setting up the appointment was easy and he was quick in responding. The shop is very clean (including the bathroom) and I like the interior design. Upon my arrival, Mo was there to greet me and he was very kind. I signed a waiver, he showed me my tattoo design, and he had me choose a final size, printing out different sizes for me to try on my desired area. He took around 2 hours to complete it and I would say out of all the artists I have tried, he has the lightest hand. It is a beautiful piece and I will be coming back to him in the future. Thank you again Mo!< /text>

I’ve got my first tattoo done here today.
went in with app with them, we talked over WeChat a few times about my tattoo concept.
Mo was patience, even I changed the flower in the very last minute.
The girl did my tattoo I think her name is Sam. She was soft, kindly and checked every steps with me.
Most important is the shop is Clean. I could see the staff very visibly cleaning their tools thoroughly. The staffs were nice and funny but professional.
Tattoo came out great, exactly how I wanted.
I can’t even begin to tell you how many compliments that I’ve received on my tattoo.
Definitely come back for my next tattoo.</review>

<text>IMPORTANT: The place is clean and to be completely honest the tattoo is good quality but however they overpriced me for my tattoo. The artist that charged me is Sam and i got a tiny heart that she charged me for 30 dollars for and then a quote that is 100 dollars like y’all be trippin the quote is soooo small like what the hell kinda stuff is that! Ask for the price before getting the tattoo if it’s too expensive I do not recommend this place.< /text>< Response>
{'time': 1582576159024, 'text': 'Hi there,\nFirst we had an agreement with the price before you get tattooed.\nAnd then the words which is at least 2 inches long, and has at least five cursive words on your finger, Plus a heart on your another finger, Over all Sam gave you a fair price. You can ask other tattoo shops how much they gonna charge you for the finger tattoos before you write this unfair review.'}<//Response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Experience a great tattoo shop for yourself! The tattoo artist is very professional and tailored to the picture I like, very detailed service and patience, reasonable price, so that my first tattoo has a great experience! After the tattoo, the maintenance is repeated, and it is worth recommending!

(Translated by Google) The tattooists are very good, the quality and cleanliness are very good, the place is very nice, the prices according to the good quality are very accessible, I give it 4 stars because I don't like the smell of the place, they should put flavoring .. .

Los tatuadores son muy buenos, la calidad y limpieza están muy bien, el lugar está muy agradable, los precios de acuerdo a la buena calidad son muy accesibles, le doy 4 estrellas xq no me gusta el olor del lugar, deberían poner aromatizante...< /Review>

Stephen & Kenneth are the best lawyer we’ve ever met! My friend was charged for 3 felony charges and it could be like 8 years jail time for him. When my friend got arrested and I was so nervous and stressful. I called more than 10 lawyers to seek for lawful advise. Stephen is the only lawyer who provided his own cell phone number and spent hours of time to explain the situation for my friend and what he could do to help my friend. He also helped me to contact the bailed bond agent Anthony to bail my friend out. Thanks for Stephen & Anthony quick response, I could bail my friend out in few hours. Stephen & Kenneth are very professional and experienced. And due to the pandemic, they understand it’s not easy for us to pay them right away. They provided us the flexible payment plan with the ongoing exceptional services. Eventually, they help my friend to get these charges dismissed! We are really appreciated for Stephen & Kenneth excellent & professional services and we will recommend them to anyone who are seeking for lawful help!</Text>

I typically do not write reviews, but I felt that the law office of Stephen G. Rodriguez & Partners really deserves some commendation.  Specifically Stephen G. Rodriguez himself.  I hired him to help me on a legal matter and from day one he didn't rest.  His diligence and tenacity towards my case was nothing short of admirable.  He spent countless hours in person, over the phone and researching to ensure the best outcome.  Opposing counsel was difficult to work with but he never gave up.  This led to a successful case, he got my case dismissed, with prejudice so that I am also protected in the future.. I always felt at ease when talking to him.  If you ever find yourself in need of a trustworthy defense attorney that will fight for you he is your man.  His long tenure will outshine others without a doubt.  He is truly genuine and cares about his clients.  I give my highest recommendation.</Text>

<text>Stephen Rodriguez is really one of the best lawyers in the game, he changed my life in such a huge positive way. Super outgoing and a great sense of humor, this is the lawyer you want to come to if you’re in trouble! I was facing 3 years in prison & Stephen was able to work things out for me to take away those 3 years and have me put on probation. I’m so honored to have hired him to work on my case!
He changed my felony into 2 misdemeanors, with no jail time! I was stressed and scared everyday I’d wake up thinking about what ( IF ) I go to prison and not being able to see my family again hurt me so much.  But with
Stephens LAW knowledge he fought for my freedom and wants to see me succeed in life. He gave me the results I wanted.
When I thought It was too much to handle and felt like giving up, stephen constantly was there to give me strength and hope. Thank you so much for your patience, your guidance and dedication on my case and most of all thank you for being there for me during those difficult moments. This means a lot to my family and me and I will forever be grateful for you. Thank you!!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

My highest compliments go out to Attorney Stephen Rodriguez and his team. Without his help, I would have been lost through an overwhelming court system. Stephen walked me through every step of the way and achieved the successful outcome of having my conviction expunged. His level of transparency, efficiency, and professionalism helped me get through the difficult situation of a first-time legal offense. I appreciated the timely communication and sincere level of empathy throughout the process. I'm grateful for Stephen's personal attention to details about my case and excellent legal strategy and representation. I highly recommend his services and will continue to consult Stephen for any future legal matters that arise.<//review>

Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Kahn I can’t thank you enough for all the help and guidance you gave me. I have never been this scared in my life. After losing my husband and my brother back to back. I felt very alone and unprotected. When the investigator reached out to me, I was very fearful. I took a chance with you, and you exceed my expectations. You meet with me, explained the whole process. You gave me the protection and assuredness I needed. The best part was that I dealt with them direct. Stephan and Ken both gave me there cell phone number. They kept me in the loop of everything. I just loved that I dealt directly with them. I would recommend them 100%.
Thank you 🙏 for all you help and guidance

<review>Let me begin with, I don’t write reviews very often.   i never thought I’d be writing a positive review for an attorney! let alone 2!  I had found Stephen G & Kenneth K at a critical time in my life.  I had just been diagnosed with a rare Non Hodgkin Lymphoma & simultaniously falsely accused of a crime in retaliation from my ex landlord losing  an eviction and having to pay me.  The judge told me I could sue him and preserved those rights for me which is rare.  There is a statue of limitations on everything.  So if he got me arrested that may buy him a lot of time & get revenge all at the same time.  So after defying that court order and drilling my locks to lock me out a month early and robbing my house he decided to make a police report that I stole his stuff 3 MONTHS AFTER i moved out! My police report was ignored but I had a knock at my door and 1/2 a dozen cops stormed in to arrest me! They said they had a FELONY warrant!  I told them they had it wrong I was the one who was locked out and robbed.  I got thrown in a disgusting jail cell with a bunch of really sick people.  You can NOT get cancer treatment if you get sick. I got very sick so I had to get representation but not any representation I needed GREAT representation because my life depended on it.  I explained what was going on to both Ken and Stephen. At first I didn’t trust them,  I didn’t think they could comprehend how complicated this case was AND also very importantly get me a positive outcome sooner then later. After a couple months (the pandemic hit big time and the courts were basically closed) I got a call asking me to come in.  They assured me it was good news not bad but I had options. When I came in they asked me what I wanted.  I said case dismissed of course and hopefully have the landlord indicted for everything. Well …..they said they had the dismissal on the table if I wanted it. We can work on the latter after & get everything expunged so I can pursue my life without any “weight” from this horrible ordeal. Without any reservation, I would recommend Kenneth & Stephen if you find yourself in trouble! I’ll add they really truly cared.  I would get a call on random Sunday nights just to see how I am! Who does that?! Ya, that’s why I’m writing this because I’m free & clear now only because they cared that much!</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><user_id>100953239210577486772< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Fortunately, I didn't need to have Mr. Rodriguez represent me but when I contacted him he called me back pretty quickly and delineated how I should handle a particular case. My review is for his professionalism, knowledge and sincerity to help me with my situation. No wonder why he has a 4.9 score which is kinda rare with lawyers. Incidentally, this was just a consultation, however if I ever needed his services (knock on wood), I wouldn't think twice to contact him and have him represent me. Thanks again Mr. Rodriguez.</Review>< user>

<Text>My interactions with the law firm Stephen Rodriguez Los Angeles

Web page has contact Information includes a telephone number..answered by a live person.
After a short conversation, I was informed my situation falls under their expertise. I had also explained the matter as being urgent.
I received a call within an hour scheduled an appointment that same afternoon to meet with Stephen Rodriguez
After the meeting I felt confident this matter would be resolved.
It was a Pleasant surprise to find, I would ask Steven a question via either text or phone. I would get a reply or call back within the hour
Proximately 10 days after our first meeting Steven was in court resolving the issue.
Throughout the day as STEVE was in court he kept me posted as to the progress. Including the obstacles ahead

Towards the end of the day STEVE informed me of the outcome of the matter.  It was finally put to rest Case closed.
If the question ever arose as would I recommend this law firm to family and friends my answer would be a resounding yes.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7b3153ccd27:0x850eab2340a22b6b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<text>Sometimes you need a second chance in life and that’s exactly what I received when I hired Mr. Rodriguez and his legal team.
Mr. Rodriguez went to work on my case immediately. Their team has the knowledge, integrity, connections and most of all they will do “whatever it takes” to get you the best possible outcome. I can’t thank him enough for really going the extra mile and getting my case dismissed. I would recommend him to anyone requiring expert legal representation. Thank you Mr Rodriguez, you delivered as you said you would, you are truly a Godsend.</text><response>None<//response>< Date>

<review>If you are seeking a team who will keep it honest, while also having the knowledge and resources to help whatever sticky situation you have found yourself in, Ken and Stephen are your guys. From beginning to end they left me feeling assured that my case was in good hands, while also keeping me informed throughout the whole thing. These guys don't end their day when they leave the office, they care about your case and will be there for you when you need them. Thank you for handling everything with grace and taking care of my case when I found myself having a hard time. I will be saving their contact info in case myself or my friends ever need help again.< /review>< Pics>

Mr. Stephen Rodriguez has been a life saver in our family. My father was able to resolve a case from 1983 which was a really difficult case that no one seemed to know how to close out. We reside in Miami, FL and he was able to help us all the way from California. The case was closed in a matter of 3 months with no conviction. This man is a skilled and talented professional who has the capability and experience an attorney shall posses. Highly recommend with eyes closed.</Review>

Attorney Steve Rodriguez helped me with a restraining order case that I was being falsely accused of. He was recommended by my immigration attorney. Once I called he and his partner got on the case right away although it was a very short notice, the day before the trial. It was a seamless process where everything was professionally handled. The matter was quickly resolved and dismissed and I was able to get back to work.< /text>

<text>Stephen G. Rodriguez & Partners are outstanding attorneys. They truly care about their clients. I live in Georgia and acquired Stephen G. Rodriguez & Partners to handle my case. The firm made it possible for me not to have to travel to California. We never met and have only had interactions over the phone, and they treated me like family. My case was just as important to them as it was to me. Stephen went over and beyond to make sure that may case was settled with the best possible outcome. I would recommend this firm to my family and friends because I know they would be in good hands.My case wasn't as easy as anticipated and they had to work extremely hard to get it taken care of. In the wake if COVID-19 Stephen represented me to the fullest. My life has changed for the better because of Stephen G. Rodriguez & Partners.< /text>< Resp>

Steve has been great since day one. When I called and needed his help he returned my call himself directly and in less than an hour! He’s been amazing since. Steve came to the courthouse and worked with the district attorney and was able to help us get the information needed to the DA quickly and effectively. He has been responsive through email text and phone calls.

I would highly recommend him he’s amazing he’s continue to follow up with us for ongoing issues and any questions that have come up. He has been our guiding force through all of this!</text>

< review>
An afternoon of fun at an outdoor Summer concert turned into my personal nightmare. I made an alcohol-driven mistake, and I found myself arrested for the first and only time in my life. I was with my girlfriend and another couple inside the Stadium, and was humiliated and embarrassed to be arrested.
Fortunately, I found Stephen Rodriguez online and he capably helped me navigate through the legal process, of which I was unfamiliar. Thanks Stephen for helping me get a favorable outcome!</review>

<Review>sometimes in life unexpected circumstances arise where you find yourself needing legal guidance; one such circumstance happened to me where I really needed some help.  I confided in a good friend who to my surprise also required some help years back and he said if i wanted to be in good hands i should call Stephen Rodriguez and Partners.  So that is what I did; and i immediately felt taken care of from the first call to make an appointment to my first sit down.  Stephen ensured that I was taken care of and comfortable which was not an easy feat as you could imagine I was extremely nervous.  The entire office really makes you feel at home and gives a real sense of comfort during a stressful time.  I was blessed to have Kenneth Kahn represent me in court and literally walk me through every step and kept checking to see if i understood what was going on and felt comfortable.  Needless to say i got the absolute best possible outcome anyone could ever ask for.  I honestly could not imagine going through a tough time without this team on my side.   Bravo to a real team of pros who really care about their clients."<//Review>< pictures>

<review>My son was facing a college disciplinary hearing for violating the school's code of conduct. I met with Steve and Ken and was immediately impressed. Even though my son was not facing criminal charges, I was aware that expulsion, suspension or a stain on my son's record were all possibilities. The lawyers won the hearing and my son graduated without any problems. I can't say enough good things about the lawyers. They were worth every penny. Thank you.

Hands down the best lawyer I've ever dealt with. I spoke to many
lawyers about my case and Mr. Rodriguez stood out for several
reasons. He was the first lawyer to return my call. He spoke to me like
a real person and not like a criminal. He listened to my story and
answered my questions. Never discussed money over the phone and
suggested I come to his office to discuss my case in more detail. I did
and I'm happy I did. In the end, he got my charges reduced and I was very happy. Thank you.<//Text>

I barely write reviews and this is one of the very few I ever wrote. I felt the need to write this one for Steve because he deserves it and I want people who is still searching for help can stop looking, Steve and his partners are the ones to go and no need to search for other “5-star” review lawyers. I’m 100% satisfied with his service and he helped me get out of some serious troubles that could have very negative impact on my life/career. Long story short, a case was filed against me and Steve has guided me to be patient and avoid some unnecessary issues that could ruin my life. I was extremely concerned and worried and Steve cares about his client a lot and talk me through the whole thing. At the end, no charges were officially filed against me and I walk away clean. I have so much gratitude to the fact that I found Steve. I felt well taken care of from the beginning and throughout my case and I was able to sleep at night. He kept me updated and posted the entire time, he discussed his thoughts and strategies with me which makes me feel like we work together to solve the issue. I highly recommend Steve to anyone.</Review>

<review>My experience with attorneys Stephen Rodriguez and Kenneth Kahn have been nothing less than excellent. I was in a situation in life that I never thought I would be. I was facing a rock bottom scenario in which the legalities would affect my future in a grave manner. Stephen who fortunately took my case dedicated himself to dropping my felony to misdemeanor. Not only did the Felony drop to a misdemeanor but the case will also result in dismissal. You have to do your part of course and abide by all requirements from the judge. If you are in a situation that seems impossible to get out of in a positive outcome I confidently recommend attorney Stephen Rodriguez. Stephen is very persistent and fights hard to have the best outcome.<//review>< Pics>

<user_name>Frank Salomon<//user_name><Time>1550815472904<//Time><rating>5< /rating><Text>A year ago I was in a very serious situation that had life changing consequences. I had an attorney who I paid so much money to, to assist me with my case in which he'd always respond "don't to worry about it." In which, I ended up with no solution after 7 months and with the same consequences as I started with. Lucky for me I found Stephen Rodriguez and partners who helped me get what I can say the best possible deal I could've gotten due to the complications of my case. Stephen Rodriguez along with Kenneth Khan worked hard on my case and gave me better results than what my previous lawyer had. I was communicated with clarity and updated with any information I needed to know and honestly I was saved from having my life ruined with life time sex registration. I would highly recommend Stephen Rodriguez and partners to anyone in need of help facing serious charges. They will assist you and walk you through your situation in the best possible manner. I am forever grateful for their help.

<Review>I did an internet search for criminal lawyers in Los Angeles and Steve Rodriguez and partners came up. I set up an appointment and they spent an hour with me answering all my questions. They told me I didn't need an attorney and how I could handle my matter in court. I offered to pay them for their time, but they refused. Much appreciated.< /Review><rate>5< /rate><Date>1584587611219< /Date>< name>

My experience with Stephen G. Rodriguez was tremendous successful. He discharge my case from felony to no case at all. He made whole process easy and painless.

The process had some unexpected complications, and the Stephen team handled it professionally and expeditiously.

He was very organized and efficient. He conducted herself in an utmost professional manner and clearly explained the final steps in the process.

I’m so happy that I hired him to solve my problem. I am very satisfied with my lawyer.

If you are looking for excellent lawyer this will be Stephen G.Rodriguez, just you know, You are in a great hands!

Thank you so much< /text>

The defense made the prosecutor's witnesses looked like they were lying and completely mistaken. There were serious charges. I thought of how easy it is to be accused of a crime without any real evidence. It's scary. And if you don't have a good defense attorney you are out of luck. If I ever am accused of a crime I didn't commit, I would definitely use these attorneys to defend me.

They were available to us 24/7 and kept us updated on the case, every step of the way. Stephen Rodriguez and partners took a horrible situation and simply made it better. The services of Stephen Rodriguez and partners truly impacted the outcome of our case, they were able to reduce the charge from a felony to an infraction.

Stephen and Ken are very professional yet personable at the same time.  They took all the stress and anxiety off my shoulders.  Stephen  and Ken are my version of the Legal Dream Team.  I could never have reached a successful conclusion without the professional representation this firm provided.  They did an excellent job on my case and everybody was more than helpful.  I would recommend this firm to others in a heartbeat!<//text>

<text>Mr. Rodriguez helped my boyfriend on his case in Los Ángeles. We are from North Carolina and my boyfriend did not have to show up at court in Los Ángeles and we thank him so much for that. He got his warrant dismissed and got him community service. He was polite and patient with my boyfriends case. Thank you so much for your help. I recommend him to anybody that is needing help.

<Text>Stephen Rodriguez has been amazing from the start. A family man, genuine and non judgmental.  Every single time I’ve met him at his office, he’s been very welcoming. His partner Kenneth Kahn is also an upstanding man.  They make you feel comfortable; if you’re unsure about something,  no question is a silly question to them. I’ve never felt rushed by either and while I knew they had other cases much larger than mine, they treated my situation with equal importance. They truly care about their clients. Both are also easy to get a hold of, and if for some reason they aren’t able to answer, the response back is close to immediate. I really appreciate Stephen and Kenneth for their help and would recommend them to anyone that needs service in the Los Angeles area.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b3153ccd27:0x850eab2340a22b6b</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

About 3 years ago, I was falsely accused of domestic violence by my ex-bf while I was moving out. Due to the strict laws in California regarding these type of cases, I was arrested, since according to him, I was the aggressor and he was the one who called the cops. I was devastated to say the least, my life was over. I had worked so hard for my career and now with a felony arrest on my record, that was over too.  My parents hired Mr. Rodriguez from day one, not only he helped me getting bailed out, but he was able  to get my case dismissed, and now less than 3 years later, thanks to him I am Factually Inocent! Mr. Rodriguez was able to get all my records sealed and destroyed. I cried like never before when I saw the letter from the sheriff's office, I felt like that was the biggest accomplishment of my life and it was all thanks to Mr. Rodriguez. I finally felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. The happiness that's this has brought to me and my family could never be repaid.  Thank you Mr. Rodriguez!!!<//Text>

I couldn’t have asked for a better attorney. So grateful I came across him. He did an amazing job on my case and was able to resolve it promptly. He also took over my fathers case and went the extra mile to help. His knowledge, confidence, and clear direction gave us a peace of mind and positive resolution we wanted. I highly recommend Steve.

Stephen G. Rodriguez & Partners are a beacon of hope to my family at a time when our options appeared limited and we didn't expect a miracle. Not only did they defend us from a unjust accusation but have been very kind and open hearted his calm and empathetic demeanor offered emotional succor to myself and those who I care about the most. My children and I are forever grateful for the service they have provided. I hereby recommend Stephen G. Rodriguez & Partners without reservation.

<Review>During the summer I found myself entangled with the law and was arrested for a felony account. Scared and confused with the legal system after my arrest I made several calls to several criminal lawyers. Mr Rodriguez was the first to return my call within an hour where others took a day or two to just get back to me. He quickly arranged a meeting where his services where hired on the spot. A plan was discussed and agreed for my representation to tackle my charged crime. Stephen Rodriguez and his team gained my trust trough their level of knowledge immediately as I felt taken care off and well represented after this meeting. My exceptional experience with this law group and its office personal did not stop there. Stephen Rodriguez and his Partners were always there to address any concerns or answer questions along the way. The final result of my to my legal entanglement came to be when the results came from the court... I found myself with no criminal record and my legal problems solved thanks to the experience and hard work of Stephen Rodriguez Law firm.</Review><time>1550093967570< /time>< userid>

He was very helpful, clearly understood the process and was just a great guy to work with. I was particularly impressed with his integrity, a real straight shooter, he always kept his word on anything he said he would do. I would highly recommend him to anyone needing legal counsel, he clearly knows what he’s doing and is very fair and easy to work with. I particularly enjoyed his encouragement and sense of humor whenever I would feel down about my case, he was very reassuring. He got me the outcome I wanted, if you need legal help you won’t find a better lawyer. Thank you Mr Rodriguez.</Review>< Name>

I am writing this review about my attorney, Stephen Rodríguez, because I am grateful for his professionalism, kindness, humanity and the wisdom he  displayed in handling my misdemeanor. I had never faced anything like this before, and I was scared. Mr. Rodríguez calmed my fears, spoke to me like a close and dear friend and not just an attorney. He was reasonable with his fee, and I felt comfortable, and,  knew that I was in the hands of a true professional. The situation was resolved by him in a very positive manner and my misdemeanor was not enforced. Mr. Rodríguez is a high level professional, as well as a gentleman who knows how to treat people in a kind and understanding manner.
I recommend his services and that of his partner.

I was alarmed and worried when I learned that my adult daughter faced a misdemeanor weapons charge in Los Angeles. Part of my apprehension came from the fact that I lived on the east coast and had no idea how to track down a capable, reliable attorney. I spend about an hour cold calling prospects, and for a while, it seemed like only receptionists had the time to talk to me. Eventually, I had the good fortune to find Mr. Rodriguez. Despite working in what I would later learn to be an extremely busy law practice, Mr. Rodriguez called me personally within 5 minutes of my call to his office. We worked out a very fair price during a 20-minute consultation, and he began working to get the best possible outcome for my daughter. In court, Mr. Rodriguez was able to get a dismissal of all charges so long as my daughter completed community service within a very generous time period—a fantastic outcome!
Over the next several months, I did have occasion to call on Mr. Rodriguez again. Every time I got the same exceptional, professional service. Most importantly, my experience has convinced me that Mr. Rodriguez genuinely cares about his clients. I have every confidence that he knows—being a family man himself—what parents go through. His obvious concern, skill, and frequent communications put my mind at ease. Should you be so unfortunate as to need a criminal defense attorney, I very highly recommend Mr. Rodriguez.<//text>

One day I decided to go on a binge drinking day. One thing lead to another and I was caught drunk in public and arrested. I woke up and had no idea what happened, at 1st I didn’t think it was a big deal. Until I began to read about it online and learn more about Penal Code Section 647(f). It made me worried, so I began to google lawyers. I came across Mr. Rodriguez, I called him and spoke with him the 1st day. All I wanted was to have Mr. Rodriguez keep me out of jail. After going back and forth he needed me to come into the office. My work is in Orange County, his Office is in LA. It’s difficult for myself to get out to LA during the week. So everything was done over the phone and email, we finally met on my actual court. My nerves were going crazy because I really didn’t know what was going to happen. Beyond my belief Mr. Rodriguez got to the court worked his magic and was able to get me a outstanding outcome. A few AA classes and a fine, after that the case would be dismissed. I would definitely recommend his expertise, he’s helped me through a dark part of my life and helped me see there is light at the end of the tunnel. I hope to never have a situation like this in the future but if I or anyone around me have a issue, he will be the 1st person i contact.</Text>

<review>I have engaged the services of Stephen G. Rodriguez as a criminal defense attorney on two different occasions, for separate, unrelated matters. His performance was of the highest caliber and he accomplished optimum results in both cases.

He concisely evaluated both situations, informed me of his strategy and of the possible results and got right to work, wasting no time. He has a superior knowledge of all facets of the criminal law in which he specializes. Additionally, his ability to use his networking skills and the contacts he has made with the courts and the prosecutors streamlines his ability to achieve successful results for his clients. I can unconditionally recommend Mr. Rodriguez to anyone who needs the most superior criminal law defense representation.

<review>Stephen proves to be an excellent choice. He is not only well connected in his local community but he also knows the judges well. He gets the legal system from a practical standpoint.  It’s not only that he went to a good law school. It’s that he fights for his clients and aggressively negotiates on your behalf.

He worked some magic for my brother in law who is an immigrant and was accused for child endangerment. Stephen was not only able to get him no jail time but also get zero bail! Who can top that?

I would highly recommend him. He is always available for questions and for YOU!< /review>< pictures>

< review>
I hired Rodriguez to defend me in a federal criminal matter. I was lied to from day one. Mr. Lewis and his business partner Kenneth H Lewis have developed an internet marketing campaign and have a perfected streamlined criminal defense workload. They advertise on their websites for so many different fields of criminal defense, they do not have the experience in many of these fields. They will not work hard to defend you. They actually will not defend you at all. I had to argue my own plea agreement because they refused to do it. They cant wait to take your money and have you sign the first plea agreement offered.  If it wasnt for my own personal effort and hiring another consultant for my case for another 8k and left it up to these two guys I would have received 10 years easy. It was the most difficult time of my life and these lawyers took advantage of me and my money.  I highly suggest you do your research and find a more appropriate attorney to defend you there are a small handful of attorneys in Los Angeles that will actually work hard for you. Mr. Rodriguez is definitely not one of them.</review>

Extremely experienced, always quick to return a call or follow up with a message back, professional, and personable –him and his legal team were there for me every step of the way. If you find yourself needing a quality criminal attorney to share his knowledge and advise you with your legal troubles, don’t hesitate and give Stephen a call right now. You won’t regret it!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I got into some trouble, and my parents, who live out of state, contacted Stephen Rodriguez. They needed someone who spoke Spanish. Stephen returned their call at 6 am, almost immediately after he heard the message they left him. He helped them find the best people to bail me out and I was out the same day. I met with him the following Monday. He was professional, understanding, caring, and made me feel comfortable. I immediately knew I could trust him. After three weeks he got my case dismissed. I didn't have to go to court. During the process he kept in contact with me, making sure I stayed on track and got my life back to normal. He believes in what he does. Stephen not only helps his clients get out of their specific situation, but he also helps them change their lives for better so they don't repeat the same mistakes. I always distrusted lawyers, but after this experience, he has changed my mind. There are lawyers out there who care and do their job because they are passionate about helping others, Stephen Rodriguez is one of those lawyers.<//text>

<Text>Stephen Kahn, Steven Rodriguez, and Ken Kahn truly helped me and my family through this difficult time. They did a great job of walking us through each part of the process and helped to prepare us for the various different outcomes that could happen. Although the end result wasn’t exactly what we had hoped for, we truly believe that it was the best possible outcome, given the circumstances, and that we would not have gotten it without their expertise.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<GmapID>0x80c2c7b3153ccd27:0x850eab2340a22b6b<//GmapID><review>Dear Attorneys Khan and Rodriguez,
Thank you so much for all your hard efforts, support, and overall
representing me in my time of greatest need and almost total
despair. You gave me, in the most professional way, the love,
concern, compassion and consideration that I needed. You were
always straight about the probabilities of my case but you
consistently offered uplifting advice and showed interest in my
future. You believed in me as a person with a future, and giving up
was never an option you presented to me.
Without the two of you, I felt I would have been totally lost,
doomed and abandoned. Words can't express the state of stress I was
experiencing as my case progressed, but with the help of countless
phone calls, meetings, and court dates with the two of you, your
guidance allowed for and provided me a second opportunity at a
normal life. To be originally charged with 3 felony counts, and walk
out of that courtroom months later with just one count of a
misdemeanor, and a grant of expungement, there will never be a
great enough thank you to show my gratitude.
Again, thank you so much and may God bless you both and your
families and your wonderful staff.
Sincerely,
Lauren< /review>< name>

Their expertise and strategies were very effective to help mitigate as much as possible his situation.

I want to publicly give thanks to Mr. Stephen Rodriguez, his staff, and colleague (Mr. Kenneth Kahn) for all their help with my case.  I was charged with Reckless Driving.  Due to the nature of my employment, having a record (a misdemeanor in this case) can severely affect my career.  Mr. Rodriguez and his team were able to get my case completely dismissed.  I could not have asked for a better outcome.  I am sincerely indebted to him and his team for protecting my career and expunging one of my biggest regrets.  Again, thank you SGR and Partners!< /Text>

<text>No one ever wants to be put in a position to where you need a lawyer, but life happens. I was looking for a criminal defense lawyer that was experienced in extradition cases, and came across Stephen and Ken by chance. I’m glad that we found them. They were extremely helpful, communicative, and available every step of the way. They assisted us in facilitating the best possible outcome for the situation we were facing. If you are ever put in a position to need a lawyer I would absolutely recommend Stephen and Ken.</text>< Rate>

We live in Florida and one night, We received a call from my daughter in Los Angeles, from jail,  and desperately started googling for lawyers in LA. We called Mr. Rodriguez at 6am PST and he got back to me within a couple of hours and started working on the case right away. As you can imagine the feeling of not being able to be there for my daughter, all we could do was trust Mr. Rodriguez. Fortunately my intuition was right, he was a man  we could trust and the perfect man for the job. He got my daughter out on bail that night, he was able to get the case dismissed, and now two years later, my daughter is factually innocent and the records have been destroyed and sealed.  What felt once like the worst nightmare of our life, today thanks to Mr. Rodriguez, is just another story not to tell the grandchildren. Stephen:We, our family,appreciate your professional and dedicated job. Mil gracias de todo Corazón Stephen!</Text>

My family and I just wanted to share our thoughts regarding Kenneth Kahn, Steve Rodriguez & Steve Kahn attorney services they provided for our family member.
From the beginning of when he was initially contacted by law enforcement, ultimately arrested and then sentenced, they were always available. This is very comforting for a family who is so far away. They explain things in laymen's terms so we could understand the process, and really did their best to help defend him. Their expertise and strategies were very effective to help mitigate as much as possible his situation.
I would highly recommend this law group for any legal matter.</Review>

Mr. Kahn is a great lawyer.  He is professional, intelligent, confident and a great gentleman with a good heart.  I hired him on two occasions to help my troubled teenage sons.  He spent time getting to know them, studying their cases, and looking for the best defense.  He fought hard in court and obtained great results.  Both of the criminal cases were dismissed.  Mr. Kahn became a great mentor for my boys and a good friend who helped turn their lives around.  He is highly recommended.</review>

<text>Steve is amazing at what he does. We were facing a very serious charge in another State and even though he couldn’t take the case he guided me through the entire process and went over the questions I should be asking my attorney. I wouldn’t have been able to get through it without his help.<//text>< Response>

I had never hired a lawyer before so I did not know what to expect. I went in because the website gave me a lot of information on my type of case and there was a free consultation. I honestly thought I would not be able to afford a lawyer here especially with the reviews they had and the fact they were located in the most recognizable skyscraper in Los Angeles. After meeting with Mr. Kenneth Kahn, my anxieties were taken away. He listened to what I had to say and I felt he really understood where I was coming from and believed what I had to say. I believe Mr. Kahn went the extra mile to try to help me and match my budget because he likes helping good people and does his work for more than just dollars. He helped me prepare for my hearing and went in with full confidence and we left with the case being dropped. I would highly recommend Mr. Kahn and would argue that going into a hearing or a court session with him would benefit you significantly more than going in alone or with another attorney.</Text>

The lawyers at Stephen G. Rodriguez and partners were highly recommended and did not disappoint.
Our outcome was great. We thank God for this. Without Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Kahn things may have
turned out differently. We would recommend them to anyone who needs a defense lawyer.<//review>

<review>I wanted to give a heartfelt testimonial about the services provided to me by Attorney's Stephen G Rodriguez &  Partners (Attorney Kenneth J. Kahn)

I have found myself in situations in the past where I thought it pertinent to attain an Attorney for my own Best interests.
From the first moment I spoke with Kenneth (Ken), I was asked "HOW ARE YOU".  I was already feeling better in fact by his demeanor.  I had found myself in a spot where I needed professional guidance and fortunately I ended up being represented by both Ken & Steve.
They clearly have CONCRETE  knowledge of the legal system, Politics of courts & Police, and how to give their Clients the best shot at a positive outcome.  In fact I'm sure that without them I would have had less stellar results.

They are very reasonably priced, easy to reach, reliable, and all around superior Attorneys.  It's also nice to have the whole team on your side and not just one Lawyer.

I now consider them my Family Attorneys and will continue to call on them whenever I feel it prudent.

Even their Assistant Gabby is awesome!!!!
I sincerely thank the whole team.

Let me start with this, Mr. Rodriguez saved my life. I'm not joking. I had an incident back in early 2012 where I was depressed, my behavior was irrational and my life was a huge mess. After I was arrested, I found Mr. Rodriguez’ webpage and I gave him a call. This is the best choice I've ever made. Mr. Rodriguez listened to me and kept me informed about my criminal case throughout the entire process. He closed my case with the best outcome possible. I was beyond happy with the result and I just can't thank him enough. I made another appointment with Mr. Rodriguez two years later to get my case expunged. Ever since then, whenever I had any question related to the case (renting apartment background check/employee background check), I would call or text Mr. Rodriguez and he responded almost instantly. If you are looking for an attorney whom you can rely on 100%, now YOU FOUND HIM!< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Kenneth J. Kahn and Stephen G. Rodriguez are exemplary defense attorneys. Whether it is financing, scheduling, or after-hours calling, they take the extra step to be accommodating to your individual needs and circumstances.

My case results exceeded my expectations. Not only did the attorneys make the best possible scenario happen, but they also allowed for my case results to be hidden from the public eye, allowing me to start from a clean slate undisturbed by the past. Both Kahn and Rodriguez are phenomenal lawyers and definitely deserve your attention.</review>< pictures>

<time>1542154506770<//time><rating>5</rating><Text>I had a few minor misdemeanors on my record from 35 - 40 years ago….I decided to have these records expunged so that i would have a clean slate….I contacted the Law Office of Stephen G. Rodriguez, and hired Mr Rodriguez to perform the services. As it turned out, because of the age of the records, the courts were unable to locate the cases, and in turn the judges would not expunge the records. Mr Rodriguez’s law firm went into action and performed exhaustive searches in numerous L.A. County
courthouses….The records were nowhere to be found….Mr Rodriguez’s legal team then spent untold hours with the DOJ in regards to this issue…After requesting several reports from the DOJ it seemed there were still issues regarding the actual case numbers listed in the DOJ reports….Mr Rodriguez personally took the issues in-hand and approached the relevant Judges seeking expungement….Finally Mr Rodriguez was able to convince both judges to sign the expungements and clear my record….Mr Rodriguez’s office went above and beyond what would normally be expected in a situation like this and followed everything through until
they were successful….I have nothing but praise for their team and can’t thank them enough for their
outstanding effort….< /Text>< Pics>

Attorney Rodriguez helped me when I needed it the most. I was very stressed out when I first met Mr. Rodriguez but he put me at ease by really listening to my concerns and answering all my questions. I was arrested for a serious crime and was facing jail time but after several months he worked out a great result for me. I give him my highest recommendation, and I rarely post reviews.

< Review>
Last July our son was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport as he arrived on a flight from Hawaii. He was immediately arrested and taken to jail. Apparently he had an out of state warrant. We reached out to family members and were recommended to attorneys Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Kahn. We interviewed the attorneys. They explained the whole process to us and answered all our questions. We felt very comfortable with them and confident that our son was in good hands. We hired them and they immediately went to visit our son, which meant a lot to us. They represented him in court and within one week of my son's first court appearance they were able to get my son released from jail. He was then ordered to return to Austin where he would deal with his criminal case. Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Kahn put our minds at ease and helped us through a very difficult situation. I would highly recommend them.<//Review>

Stumbling on Steven Rodriguez, and Kenneth Kahn has made a huge difference in my life. They have come to my aid not once but twice, one of which I was facing a felony. They worked with me financially, and genuinely care which I feel is a rarity. Having attorneys I can trust who really know their stuff makes life so much easier. Looking back now, I know leaving these things to chance is very risky.  Thanks guys for having my back!

I just received one of the best phone calls of my life. With some stipulations I happily agreed to, my case was dismissed! Stephen Rodriguez and Kenneth Kahn are a team that knows the ins and outs of the legal system. Something I know nothing about! I was facing a charge that, if convicted, would have changed my life forever. The stress was overwhelming. I emailed Stephen Saturday after a week of no sleep and to my surprise, he called me right back! I met with Stephen and Kenneth shortly after and they took charge from there. I want to thank Stephen Rodriguez and Kenneth Kahn for their honesty, availability and reassurance. If you should find yourself, like me, in the need of a strong team to represent you, Stephen Rodriguez and Kenneth Kahn are the ones to have in your corner.  A+</text>

rodriguez is an okay attorney. sure he represented me and showed up to court but he did so with no enthusiasm. he didn't get me a great deal and did not put effort into the work. It was still better then going at it alone, but it was probably no more work then a public defender would have done. I don't approve of how rodriguez conducts business and would just like to tell you to seek other options before making a decision.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I live in South America and recently I had a legal problem in Los Angeles, when I returned to my country I contacted the study on Thanksgiving and as soon as Stephen called me, I told him that I had to appear in court and did not know what to do . He took my case and managed to keep the prosecution from filing charges against me.

I am very grateful, it is highly recommended, with a very cordial treatment and a lot of legal experience.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Choosing Mr. Rodriguez as our attorney was a wise choice. Five months ago our son was facing a serious problem in California. I live in Spain and it was difficult to find a lawyer when I'm not in California. I went back to the Internet and God put me on the computer screen of his law firm. During this time, his attention (always ready) and his advice were fundamental for this case to be dismissed without charges.
Thanks Mr. Rodriguez.

Elegir al Sr. Rodríguez como nuestro abogado fue una sabia elección. Hace cinco meses nuestro hijo se enfrentaba a un grave problema en California. Vivo en España y fue difícil encontrar un abogado cuando no estoy en California. Me volví a Internet y Dios me puso en la pantalla de la computadora de su bufete de abogados. Durante este tiempo, su atención (siempre lista) y sus consejos fueron fundamentales para que este caso fuera desestimado sin cargos.
Gracias Sr. Rodriguez.<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmapID>

<Review>They charged my credit card twice on my wedding day and that fumbled things in my account they forgot the red carpet and the door jam of the car was dirty so it stained the wedding dress and they denied charging my card twice and I had to contact my bank and open up a claim The driver was cool and helpful I had a good night the part that concerns me the most is there was something fishy about the payment part of it how do you charge the card twice and then deny doing it if I didn’t have a back up form of money it would’ve affected my wedding day financially and that’s not cool they gave me back $30 for the Red carpet not Being there I don’t know if that was the actual amount I paid for it It was a nice limo I Like the driver but there is some crucial failures I could’ve affected my ability to even pay for the remaining stuff on my wedding day Ultimately it was my bank that took care of this problem not them</Review>< Pics>

<text>As a travel agent, I frequently am asked to provide limousine service either to and from LAX, or occasionally the Hollywood-Burbank Airport.
Yesterday a group of 12 passengers (10 from 3 separate locations, and 2 separately from LAX and back) had the pleasure of being transported by Paramount Limousine drivers.  The 3 pick-ups with 10 people were performed exactly as requested with times set out for each pick-up and the airport transfers went off without a hitch.  I have been told that the drivers were extremely polite and friendly and made them feel comfortable about the service.  That's why I recommend Paramount any time a client needs a limousine!

I have used Paramount Limo for several years and the service has been wonderful.  Just last night we were stuck at LAX due to a mix-up with friends and the limo service had someone there for us within 20 minutes of my frantic call.  The drivers are always professional, the cars clean and fresh.  I highly recommend Paramount Lime.<//Review>

<Review>You will not be more unimpressed I can guarantee it. If you are looking to rent a limo, go anywhere else. They will cancel on you in under 24hrs consistently, and when they do not even have the consideration to do that, they will send other services you did not order, and tell you 5 min before arrival. There fleet is mediocre at best- and clearly their management is 3rd string at Best. Do yourself a favor and uber, you will be happier with your money. Or use any other limo service in the area, thank god for competition, these guys wont last long unless they purge their management.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>Our driver was the best. We had a surprise cruise for a member of our party. Our driver had no idea it was a surprise. He thought he was just taking us to the ship. I pulled him aside and explained the situation to him. He was wonderful. You would have thought he knew it was a surprise for a long time. He acted like he was taking us on a tour of LA. Great great guy. Very nice. We would have never pulled it off if he hadn’t been so quick thinking. The vehicle was very clean inside and out.<//Text>< pics>

When I called paramount limo, I was clueless about what kind of limo and how many hours would be good for our ride because we wanted to go different places. The lady on the phone was very professional and patient, she gave me different options and helped me to find the best choice and price. I chose their Hummer limo, it was very nice. Thank you Paramount limo for making a wonderful night for us.< /review>< pictures>

I Used Paramount Limousine to take me from my home in South Bay to LAX and then back a week later. I was a little hesitant to shell out more than cheap cab/Uber fare for the simple transfer, but after hearing from a friend how great their service was, I had to see it for myself what the fuss was about/
The driver Robert was an extremely nice man wearing a proper black suit, shiny shoes and a huge smile! He was so pleasant</Text>

<Text>WOW! What an amazing birthday I recently had just a few weeks ago, and I must spend a moment to thank Paramount Limousine Service for making it a perfect night!
At first I wasn't sure how to accommodate my 15-some-odd friends for an evening of dinner and drinks, and so I quickly thought to call a Limo Service so everyone could get picked up at a few locations without having to drive. I looked on the internet and was happy to try Paramount Limousine based on the many years of service in the business.
After a wonderful conversation with Gabby, I secured a night that would have all my guests safely escorted throughout the city AND we could drink in the car! Gabby was so personable and reassuring, she made my reservation so easy and pleasant that it seemed as if this plan was truly the right choice.
When the car showed up, I was impressed that the driver had all my details, stops, and concerns well in mind. The driver was cool and dressed to impress. I loved the car I chose and was so happy to see it kept in awesome condition. We bumped music all night with the wicked stereo and drank champagne and mixed drinks in the back! The driver didn't mind putting the partition up either, I didn't even have to ask!
Between the reservationist, the amazing car, and the driver- I'm so excited that i can now say I love getting limos and it's all thanks to Paramount Limousine service!
I'll be using them again for certain.

In order for this post to go through I have to at least click 1 star.  This company doesn't deserve a star. I reserved a Sprinter Mercedes to take us to the airport.  Yes, they were pretty good in sending you confirmation.  The day before the pick up date I was calling the 800 number and the 310 number that were provided to confirm the pick up.  Nobody picked up the phone so I left several messages but no one called me back.  The next morning (day of pick up), a red PRIME TIME SHUTTLE arrived at my house.  Oh my god, you wouldn't believe it.  The van showed up and it was so filthy outside. I have ridden Shuttle before but they didn't look like that.  I asked the driver what happened to the Sprinter and he said he doesn't know anything.  My husband and I were so embarrassed in front of our guests.  We didn't have a lot of time to call for other transportation so we decided to just take the ride.  We got in the van and it was so disgusting. The windows were full of hands print all over and the inside was so dirty and all we could do was to ignore it.  We didn't want to ruin our Vegas trip.  When we got to the airport and while we were waiting to board the plane I called Paramount Limousine again and finally Shawn answered and  I told him what happened.  All he can tell me was that the driver got sick.  I was so furious and I told him that someone should've called me. They could've called me and I would've been able to make other arrangements.  After our trip I noticed that the company charged us the full amount.  I called Shawn again and told him that I am willing to pay $80 for the shuttle and he said "I'll do $50". I was pleased to hear it so I said "thank you".  Then I noticed the account again that he only refunded $50. I called him again and told him Shuttle doesn't costs $142.50. He insisted that he already gave me a discount. I wasn't even asking for a full refund.  All I asked is to charge me what is fair.  I wasn't even asking for a full refund.  They screwed up big time and I was giving them a chance to redeem  themselves. I told him that I wasn't very happy with their service and that they will not be getting a good review from me.    He said "go ahead" and I hung up the phone.  Three minutes later he called back and my co-worker answered the phone and I told her that I don't want to speak to Shawn anymore.  This is when it got crazy, Shawn left a message to my co-worker stating the following: "TELL HER THAT I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES AND I KNOW WHAT SHE DOES".  He also stated that he will also give me a bad review. I don't even know what he meant giving me a review because I don't own the company I work for. I called him back and told him to stop threatening me and that I have the right as a consumer to give him a review which is a bad one.  He continued to say "GO AHEAD AND YOU'LL SEE".  OMG! This man was out of control.  I realized that this is not something I can take lightly.  I am very alarmed that this company would use my personal info that I provided to them to threaten me.   YES, THIS IS MY TRUE AND HONEST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS COMPANY and there is NO EXAGGERATION.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Called Paramount Limousine Service this morning when my ride failed to show up at LAX to get me.  They had someone there in only 15 minutes to take me to Ojai!  Wonderful service and my driver was so pleasant and kind.  Thank you!!!</Review>

<Text>I called last week to verify that there was no limits on hours. Then there is nothing on the website about 5 hours minimum. They call me to verify the reservations at 130 pm the day before and everything was good to go! Got a call at 800 pm the night before to tell me that they were not going to Do what we had already confirmed. We reserved for 830 am. They refused to give what we ordered and wanted to charge us $500 more than the quote what we were going to be charged! When we called to cancel, he said ok and then hung up on me without verifying anything. I will never use them and would never refer them to anyone!< /Text>< user_id>

Never showed up for my ride to the airport. I didn't receive a phone call that my driver would not arrive so I had to call Paramount to ask why my ride was not there. They told me I should call an Uber. Thankfully, I still made my flight but it caused quite a bit of concern with LA traffic. Obviously, I was not pleased with my (lack of) transportation service.< /Review>

I highly recommend. This is my most favorite laser tag place. I had tons of birthdays back when I was either 7 through ten. I always
had a great experience.  All of the guests also had a blast. Once I inviting like 50 ppl and my mom was like “ Only twenty of them will come.” But all of the guests came and said the party was great. I love this place<//Review>

<text>Visited for a birthday party. From what I saw they provided pizza, soda, and dessert. The kids played 2 short sessions of Lazer tag and were also provided a few coins for the arcade games. Pretty much everything you'd expect a kids play place to be.< /text>< pics>

One of my customer's chose to have her son's  birthday party here. The staff is over the top helpful, kind and punctual!! I've planned several events for customers and this venue is hands down the most attentive. They allowed my team to set up early, ensured everything ran smoothly,  offered to help set up our decor, tear down, helped us to our vehicle and load up, and even provided on of my youngest team members coins to go play while we finished collecting the last of our belongings!! The customer service is amazing. Thank you for your help with Armen's 8th birthday!!< /review>

Great place for a kids party! They have 3 small party rooms that can be connected to make bigger rooms for larger parties. Plenty of arcade games and their laser tag room is well laid out and very fun. Equipment is clean and works great and the staff is super friendly and helpful. All around a fun place to play and a great time for kids and families alike!</review>

Was here for my nephew’s birthday. The actual laser tag part is fun. The arcade is small and the rooms a cozy as well. We had a great time, I “killed” a bunch of children and adults, and the kids had fun too.< /Review>

VERY fun! It is for sure on the small side but it provides countless hours of fun laser tag. Bring in your friends-- it's more fun that way!

The staff is nice and they have a great sense of humor.< /Text>

Went here a few weeks ago and played with son for the first time (rather than bringing my laptop, which is what I usually do). Life changing. So much fun. Friendly staff, amazing Lt course. Any parents out there know what I mean?</Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>My friend had his son's 10th birthday party here and at 810pm while I was still eating; They came to spray down the tables and lift the table cloths from right underneath me.
I had to put my plates and drinks in my lap so they clean. That was beyond rude.
I checked the room we were in at 9pm,  to see if they had another party, but It was empty.
Why we were rushed I don't know.
But my kid's birthday is coming up in July and I won't  have here .
Thanks for saving me money and headache.< /text>< pictures>

The best laser tag I've ever played. The arena had a great layout and the guns and suits were almost perfectly accurate. The employees were also a lot of fun and they even listen to some ideas we had. Highly recommended for anyone.< /Review>

Such a blast! It tires you out but is exciting to run around and hide in nooks. I've met some funny kids here. They are actually pretty pro- I can't really keep up. It is a great group activity/you get a work out.< /review>

Ultrazone is super fun to go to with friends, I spent a lot of time here, sometimes for birthdays and sometimes with a group of friends. The place is great, very safe, and the lighting and dark atmosphere adds to the excitement. The only thing I don't like about the place is their rules. I get that younger kids are playing, but can't they seperate ages and allow running, wall running, crawling, etc.? That's the only thing that lowered the fun but thr place is great.<//Review>

My nostalgic place. My grandparents used to own a ultrazone in North Palm Beach, FL replaced by Palm Springs Pizza. For those who don't believe me, you can litteraly go there and ask what the place used to be before the pizza place, they know.  This place looks almost exactly like my family's, and I miss it so much! It's not the same being able to go in the back, but it's still really fun and memory giving!<//review>

LlHad a great time the other night. Made reservations a few days before. The staff was friendly and the environment was not too bad. I will definitely keep coming back. Would recommend to anyone. All ages.

Also what did it for me was the music. Classic trance. Absolutely incredible listening to my favorite genre. Keep playing classic trance you guys!<//review>

<text>Not the greatest bang for your buck place.  By the time the kids go in put the gear on and receive the mandatory safety and rules presentation 15 to 20 minutes are gone so you think yo get 30 minutes of play but it is only really 15 minutes.< /text><rate>2<//rate>< user>

NEEDS MORE FOG !!! the playing area has almost no fog you can see across map and see the wall. Next they need to setup game mods they realy just need a re-model of the place with some teens that play lots of games not some 24 or 21 years who have no idea what Infection is or other game modes. This place is fun though with the stuff they have. Mostly the easyest thing to fix is just to fill the room with  a smoke machine . If can be turned off is kids under 10 or so play but mostly for safty which they care about alot but  older people can just play fine in the smoke.

7/10 place to go and check out

-safe  > Older people are there but they seem to know the rules are very well made of getting kicked out
-fun for a few hours
-clean not to bad for a place that is full of people some of the guns were in bad shape but that was ok mabe a few clips broken or a lazer gun that had a part chiped off.

-GREAT staff < I still remember a staff member gave my group some free tokens since we missed a lazer tag game since it was full that showed how much they care.< /Text>

Went for 100k tuneup. They are very friendly and professional on the phone and in person. Quick appointment and good service. All inspections+oil change+filters was about $500 in half day. Parts $ seemed high (like air filter for $45?!) but making myself believe they used good quality parts.. Overall Good!<//Text>

I have been of customer of John's for several years. I have found them to be trustworthy and reliable. They will give me options when recommended repairs are not in my current budget. And I always appreciate their consideration and respect.< /Review>

Never go to this business for car repairs. They will purposefully break one of your car's parts and charge you for it. This business is dishonest, disrespectful, and unfair. This business is a scam.

I went in to have service John"s Auto Pros my Mitsubishi Montero sport ls to have service Transmission Fluid change and all belts. John's called me the Mitsubishi Serpentine Belt Water Pump to Power Steering the bracket hold a bolt to adjust belts broke. John told me they make a tight wrap around the bolt to secure the bolt for me to be able to drive home. And he told me to have part to replace and bring the car back. John called me that there is a part ready for replacement and I went to have the car, there was a wrong part and waited for a new part to be placed again. John called me back for the car to pick up, then when i checked the bracket again to confirm if its repaired, i saw one the bracket adjustment / bolt broken off into pieces. It was clear that they broke it after they called me because the broken piece was shiny (void of covered oil) meaning it has been recently damaged. Then they claim I broke it and charge me over $700.

Although John (the owner of this business) is nice to talk to, he should know the truth of what happen to my car. I suspect one of his mechanics lied to him that I broke the car where they clearly broke one of the parts of the car. I also suspect one of the mechanics tied the bolt too tightly and then the part broke off.

Never bring your car to this business. You will get scammed.</text>

< review>
I have now been to this shop four times.  Each time the repair has been over $500.  I drive an older car and such things are to be expected.

Each time I’ve come in, they’ve accurately diagnosed and fixed my car.  Each time, the car has stopped doing whatever it was doing that brought me to the shop in the first place, so obviously they accurately diagnosed and fixed my car.  Each time, I was brought out to the bay and shown the broken or damaged area and parts.  It was thoroughly explained to me what was ok and which parts needed to be replaced.

This shop is also owned by a woman.  She’s honest and fair in her dealings with me.  This put my mind at ease that I wasn’t walking into some chop shop that was going to screw me over and fix things that didn’t need fixing.  She understands what it feels like to be a woman alone walking into a male dominated shop.

Lastly, this shop gave me courtesy rides to snd from my home in valley center.  I did not have to ask for this, they offered it to me which I thought was excellent customer service.

I will continue to use this shop and highly recommend them to others.< /review>

Don't know if the shop is legal or not but when I see employees smoking while performing work on cars like Oil Services it makes me nervous that a fire could break out.
The shop is not organized and it is trashy. There is grease and oil buildup from years of not cleaning up the floors.
It wasn't any better when it was Big O and now it is Tire Pros of Escondido. I think all that has changed is the franchise royalty for the owner because I do not and have not witnessed any new changes in the appearance let alone safety of the shop.
Again, its the cigarette smoking allowed in a highly flammable fluid environment. Looks like I'll be notifying the Escondido Fire Department Pros next and OSHA…
I'm not saying by any means that the services you pay for are the fail here. Its the staff greeting, (none), lack of care by shop employees entering and moving cars. Grease on my fenders, door & steering wheel. You'd think they would wipe off the areas they touch but they do sometimes use a paper floor mat.
When my tires were pulled for inspection, they never wipe off any greasy hand prints off my $1600 Rims. I love getting in my car and smelling cigarette smoke as I drive off.
So Mr. Owner, if you are really paying attention to your reviews, as much attention should be given to the condition of your shop and the overall cleanliness and professionalism from the staff in the office to the employees on the shop floor.
No one can afford to be closed for a week or two for a deep overhaul and cleaning I'm sure but it would be worth it to repaint, resurface the floors and actually live up to the last word in the new name…"Pros"
Thank you for the time and I will happily review your shop again should I stop by for an Oil Change.<//text>

<review>Would not recommend, definitely amateurs working there.  When I called to get an estimate to mount/balance tires the guy told me the price and hung up on me. The guy had an attitude!  I actually ended up going there after to have a tire fixed, he was unable to fix and still charged me!  I told him: You didn't fix it! His response: But we tried! HA!!! Then told me not to come back!  His attitude came out again! You bet I won't! What a way to run a business. This guy should NOT be working there! The reviews are correct.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>We had a nail in a tire - came in to the shop they fixed it and we were happy with the service.   I watched them interact with many customers and thought they were very professional and personal.  After we left shop we went down to a car wash and in that auto wash our windshield wiper was ripped off so we went back to the tire shop - they looked up what we needed to replaced both front wipers but they didn’t carry them but sent us down to Auto Zone and told us to get the ones we needed and bring them back and they would put them on for us - no charge.  So we did....   thank you for all your help.  We will definitely use this business anytime we are down in this area.</text>< pics>

{'time': 1532715268309, 'text': 'Louann, Your review is very unwarranted and unfair. When you brought your car in for the oil change and two tires, we told you that your front brakes were metal to metal, that they needed to be replaced and we even brought you out to the car to show you. You opted not to do your brakes because you did not have the money. You then did indicate that you had them changed at this location previously and we did try to find your invoice, but were unable. We did , however, tell you that if you could find the invoice or any other  record, including bank statements or credit card statement that would show that you paid anything to this shop, which you indicated you thought that you could, and it was less than 1 year or 12,000 miles, that we would definitely honor the warranty on the brakes. You agreed and said you would look. You then came back saying that your car was pulling when you put the brakes on, and we again indicated that was because your brakes were metal to metal. There is no way that we did or could have done anything to your brakes other than let you know what condition they were in.'}< /Response>

<rating>1</rating><review>Went in for oil change and two tires.  Drive home was scary.  Car wobbling and suspension light coming on when veering left.  Took back and they said it was my brakes that I needed rotors.  Just had rotors replaced a year ago.  Of course they have no record of that or the four tires I bought their either.  I have been going here for years even back when it was big O tires.  Just think kind of shady that records not their and why my car was fine until oil change and two new tires.  Think I'll just find another place to go, not much else I can do.<//review></record>

< review>
I had 6 new tires installed on my RV on March 7, 2016. When I picked up the vehicle, I noticed large black stains on the floor under the pedals. This was really unfortunate because I had cleaned the whole RV and shampooed the carpet the day before to prepare for a long trip. The manager called the employee who replaced the tires and asked him to go clean the stains. The employee and I went to the RV and he starts scrubbing but stops after 3 seconds saying "yeah this is making it worse. I cannot clean that. These stains are not from me, they were here before". I tell him I shampooed the carpet and they are clearly from him. Then he started shouting "WHAT DO YOU EXPECT, THIS IS A TIRE SHOP!" and then rambled on how well he cares for his own RV, and he literally walked away. This is the worse service/treatment I have ever received from a shop. I spent $1117 on this job, at least I would have expected to have my vehicle and I treated with care.<//review>

I'm not sure how we could have repaired your tire and not put air in it as we have to take the tire off the wheel in order to fix it, and when we reinstall the tire, we have to put air in  it to seat it on the rim. I admit that they may not have brought it up to the correct air pressure and if that is correct I will gladly refund your money for the repair. Just as a point of information,  no service station is allowed to charge you for air or water in California."}</response><Review>I went to get a nail out of my wheel they charged me 19.95 but didnt have the courage to put air in it .

DO NOT SHOP HERE. Their website quoted me one price, then when it came time to pay they charged me an extra $100 and acted like that was normal. On top of that they set up an appointment then when I got their they said they wouldn't have the tires until the next day after adjusting my appointment so they would have the tires in stock by the time I got there.<//review>

Inexpensive oil change, however, they said they would check and refill fluids. When I left there, they did not refill window wiper fluid.< /review>

Left tens of thousands of dollars worth of tools and equipment vulnerable to theft. I dropped off my work van to have a nail removed and tire patched. Came back to find it in a back parking lot with the doors unlocked AND THE WINDOWS DOWN. The van was visible to the drive through traffic of the taco shop next door, basically advertising itself.

Company and personal property left unguarded in a very shady part of town. How hard is it to lock the vehicle when you park it?<//text>

Sent my son in to get new tires on his car. When my son drove away about 10 feet his tire came off because they did not put the bolts on correct. Instead of them owing the mistake they were pointing the fingers at each other. I will never go to this place again thank god my son was not driving up our vc grade when this happy. The carelessness of this place could of cost me kids life.</text>

They have coffee and candy and the guy behind the desk (preassumably John) is a man of few words, but seems like a no BS kind of guy. I like it there.<//Text>

Worst tire place I've been to. They were so slow and they were not packed. I needed a tire to get patched that had a nail. They told me 40 mins  an it took two hours.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Definitely the best outdoor dining you'll find right now. I took my husband their for his 30th birthday, I made the reservation months in advance requesting something more private or special and offered to pay more for that. However, I do not think that they read the requests for the reservation. They also do not do anything for birthdays either. I was a little disappointed by this because the meal was awfully pricey and we've had that something extra at equivalently, if not more so, fancy restaurants for birthdays and anniversaries. The meals were great and the staff was attentive. Overall a great experience, can't wait to experience this restaurant inside where there is no wind!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Went for a Friday lunch. Melodious and soothing music, beautiful space, and warm service. The olive bread already showed the quality of the food. The veggies were so fresh and the meatballs were tastier than most of the others we had tried. You shouldn't missed the black truffle cavatelli - not only for the sake of the truffles (though that's enough) but also for the sausages! We also loved the cannolo - ultra-crispy shell with mouth-watering ricotto. Thank you, chef.<//Review>

Really wanted to like this place but the food was sub-par, as the cocktails and wine. Most of my crew was a little sick from it afterwords too.
The people working there are great, though.<//Text>

Very watered down flavors.. Not what i expected, had the Tagliatelle bolognese and it just didn't have any pop, was kind of dry. Not impressed with the food.

The outdoors courtyard seating was great though, and the tiramisu was delicious. Service was ok, nothing special.<//text>

<Review>My daughter has recently moved to Santa Monica & she treated me to a wonderful evening at Orto.
The food & atmosphere is top notch.
I am rating only 3 stars due to our server Silvio C.
He never introduced himself, asked if we had ever been there. Then encouraged us to order our wine, appetizer & main course all at once, saying we would wait a long time otherwise.
We saw bread baskets on other tables so as Silvio was passing our table we asked him for our bread. Ended up asking him three times! Finally a different server brought it for us.
I would also like to note that the restaurant was busy but didn’t seem to be overwhelming, Silvio acted as if he didn’t want to be there.
At the end of the meal he brought our check & literally just dropped it on the table, never thanked us or welcomed us back.
I honestly don’t ever leave reviews but felt it was necessary in this case.
Receipt # M97T for reference, September 11, 2020
Again, wonderful food & atmosphere & also must let you know that every single other employee that we had contact with was great!< /Review>< user_id>

Lobster pasta was great!!!! We weren’t very hungry but still finished all. Tomato sauce was soooo good, and noodle was cooked perfectly! Lovely place with lovely and professional servers. Lamb chops were also very impressive. Also loved panda cotta, not too sweet, with berries on top, perfect finish.< /text>

<text>This is one of the best, if not the best, meals I have had at an Italian restaurant in LA. For the middle of a pandemic they have an almost ideal setup occupying the entire courtyard of the building where the restaurant is located, so ample spacing between tables. My dining partner and I shared 4 courses - artichoke salad, fried calamari, tagliatelle bolognese and Veal Milanese. Every dish was exquisite. Had an amazing 2008 Barbera de Alba to go with it.  Perfection.< /text>< date>

This is our second year hosting a conference business dinner at Orto. It did. It disappoint. The owner Andrea created a custom 5-course menu based on our needs and paired with wine a selection. His flexibility made working with him effortless. The food was delicious and the portions, while small were more than sufficient. The staff were accommodating and polite. We will return.<//text>

Small Italy in Downtown Santa Monica.

Something like Orto )). We started with Carpaccio di manzo Al tartufo. Totally organic and tasty. After we were ready for pasta - the symbol of Italy. My husband chose Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, me - Spaghetti alla carbonara. And I should say it was LEGEN ... wait... DARY! Fresh tomatoes, delicious original sauces and Italian Parmesan cheese made our romantic evening.

I know that Italian food are incredible, but I didn't know how much.<//Text>

Service was unbelievably slow. We left after waiting for our meal for over an hour. The Management did invite us back for an opportunity to make it right.  Not sure if well go back, to many things went wrong.  We gave our waiter several chances to make it right before we walked out.< /review>

Top notch Italian restaurant. Perfect place for an intimate dinner with a loved one!

The restaurant is clean and finely detailed with stonework, curtains, and Italian herb plants.
The frosted exterior glass detail adds plenty of privacy from the sidewalk and provides an intimate feel.
The wine list provides a few options for every palette and is accompanied with a chef’s menu that offers a variety of starters, salads, pastas and entree’s to suit your appetite.
Each dish was well presented, exquisite, delicious, and hands down terrific experience from start to finish.< /review>

This is actually my second time eating here. And shame on me for not writing after the first experience! Love this restaurant. So upscale and so chic.
Great location, great space with elegant ambiance.
Outstanding wine list and cocktail list. Food was wonderful, great seasonal tasting menu and wide a la carte menu.
Service was beyond amazing!< /review>

<Text>Wow! This place was incredible all the way through, from the antipasto to the limoncello, top notch Italian fare. We also had three salads that were absolutely delicious but also, three entrees that were to die for: salmon; pasta with lobster & cioppino. You have to save room for dessert though, the sorbets were very fresh & tasted homemade.</Text>< pictures>

<user_id>113402861516244604694< /user_id><text>We went to Orto for a family gathering. Knowing we have 2 kids with us we made the reservation early at 6pm. There was nobody else in the restaurant and we got very slow to almost no service. Strike one.

After ordering, the appetizers came out very fast and everything tasted great. However, the server didn’t even ask or wait till we are done with the dishes and started to pick up the plates while I am still eating. Strike two.

Most of us got pasta which was all very tasty. Our main complaint is not about the food but the service. I do feel bad for the cook because his talent was totally shadowed by the poor service.

When the final bill comes, I was charged automatically 20% gratuity which comes out to be almost $75. Yes, $75 for service that was almost nonexistent. We have to ask for water, for the desert menu. While I was making the reservation, setting down, during and after ordering, even till when I ask for the bill, I was never told that 20% gratuity will be added to the bill. Strike three.

We weren’t going to argue with them over the tip amount in front of my guests and I think they know that. Because of all the reasons above, we will never return to Orto again. There are restaurants with way better service in Santa Monica.< /text><rating>2< /rating>< date>

Impressive is the term that applies to this brand new authentic Italian spot in downtown Santa Monica. Elevated cuisine in a dignified and classy setting.
Very creative use of the local farmers market bounty, and all things seasonal and fresh from the sea......bravo!
A meal I won't soon forget.</review>

Everything about our experience was excellent: our salads were crisp and flavorful; our pastas were delicious, toothsome, and innovative (the crab pasta with the grapefruit is really good); the wine was excellent; and basil/pistachio ice cream was sumptuous; and the service was really good. Oh and they have the most amazing olive bread and extra virgin olive oil! My one tiny recommendation is that they add more wines by the bottle under $50. Surely there are some Italian wines that are good values that could be added to the list?<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Snubbed at another Santa Monica 'establishment' on our 25th Wedding Anniversary, we were able to get a table at Orto without waiting. There essentially was no way our experience could have been better anywhere. Professional service, the dishes were inventive, fresh and exhibited true balance. Santa Monica has many Italian restaurants, but this one is top of the class and deserves attenzione nazionale !!< /Review>< pictures>

Worst dinning experience in years. They brought the wrong food, the plate they did bring was impossible to eat with excess salt to mask the poorly made nature of the dish. The service terrible. Really truly disappointing following a Fairmont hotel recommendation.</Review>

Enjoyed a nice evening at Orto. To start we had the mushroom tortino which was excellent as well as the burrata and tomatoes. My friend and I shared the homemade pasta with lobster and the pasta carbonara, two of the best pasta dishes I've had since my last trip to Italy.  Great service. Definitely going back!< /Text>

<Text>Andreas is very welcoming in his newly opened Italian in former Jiraffe space. Delicious fresh greens in the asparagus salad, the salmon was beautifully served and was very tasty. Our group very much enjoyed the panna cotta and chocolate mousse desert. Excited to have a new delicious Italian in Santa Monica and we plan to frequent it.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>A really special new restaurant - excellent food and wine, good atmosphere, great service. Delicious starters include octopus salad, the pasta botarga had just the right amount of salty tang, and the veal chop with mushrooms was succulent and clean. Panna cotta was the perfect dessert. A varied wine list, with good range. I think this place is set to become a Santa Monica favorite - a smaller Tar and Roses, with the advantage of being open for lunch, too - and it’s a huge upgrade from Mare, it’s predecessor here.<//Review>< rate>

<Text>Convenient location and delicious product. But no where to sit to enjoy your spoon/bowl desserts :( I wish they had some patio furniture outdoors.. there’s plenty of space for it.

This time, we got the herbal milk tea jelly drink. It was easy to carry around, and super yummy - light, creamy, and the jelly was so soft!

<Text>Having friends here is always great to chill at while munching on desserts! The employees are nice and very attentive to all guests and provide the best service they can provide. Even with the busy holiday having a full house they still do their best to satisfy every customer. Personally I go for the teas for drinks but all the drinks I know are delicious and very refreshing. All the desserts are made with fresh ingredients and always great to share with friends for the mountain of sweetness! Definitely give it a check if you're ever nearby.< /Text>< Pics>

Finally a Meet Fresh location that is closer to my area. Nice store, a little small and the wait can be out the door, (waiting space is small). Lots of seating, especially in the back. Good and quality is great as usual.<//Review>

Their Taro series desserts are on a bed of brown sugar flavored shaved ice. I had the icy taro ball #4, it had some taro flavored mochi balls, red bean, blocks of actual taro, and boba on it. The block of taro was a little hard and flavorless. Overall it was just okay. Last time I had the signature grassy ice jelly and that was much better!!</review>< pictures>

<Text>My favorite CHINESE dessert place. Always come here for dessert after dinner. The red bean soup with boba is one my favorites. This is a popular place for the locals and the line is long in the evening. I always use the self ordering machine on the counter to avoid the line. Enjoy dessert here and a good fellowship with friends.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Overpriced. Very small portion. Shaved ice had already melted to nearly iced water. I didn't eat it and asked them for a replacement. The store associate got annoyed. Horrible customer service!! If you want to sell Asian food, make it right and authentic. Shaved ice is very easy to make and has a very high profit margin. Don't try to cut corners and rip off your customers and think they won't notice.<//Review>

First time here with my son we both got the black sugar fresh milk with boba. They use reusable plastic cups and straws. I didn't know I had to mix drink so you can taste the flavor. The price range is ok. Overall everyone should try it.</text>

< Review>
Drinks decently priced and karaoke is usually fun. But the bartenders have major attitudes and only cater to their friends. Karaoke is a jukebox set up so you pay a dollar per song you choose. Everyone puts their songs on the queue but the bartenders and their friends put their songs up first. So they skip and delete songs from all of the other paying customers. Resulting in customers leaving or not being able to sing at all because the place closes before they get a chance to. Definitely a waste of money. I would score lower, but i gave 2 stars because I've had a good time on a couple occasions and because the price of the alcohol.< /Review>

Wasn't sure I would like a karaoke jukebox as opposed to a live KJ. But the bar regulars and the hype crowd made it a night to remember. Looking forward to singing here again. 😁🎤🎶< /text>

Karaoke, drinks, karaoke, drinks, friends, fun, karaoke, drinks, etc etc. Small place but fits a good amount of people. Sangria sometimes around as unexpected treat. Card or cash accepted. Parking lot accommodates many guests. A good end of night stop to try to belt some drunken tunes. If popular night, the karaoke may not happen for your song choosing as time runs out fast.<//text>

Small place. Don't expect a great selection of alcohol. They mainly serve beer and Moscow mules made with soku vodka. So it's really an Asian Mule. The Karaoke however, is great. You can sing from anywhere in the bar since they have a wireless mic and no stage.</Text>

Nice people , real fun and friendly place especially on kareoke nights , but it is small , or intimate you could say and I'm happy to say that the people that do attend the tavern are pretty respectful of the resident homes and Streets of their surrounding area as far as not littering the yards n Streets and I'm especially grateful bcz I happen to live down the Street and behind the tavern . And conveniently enough their is Hanks Pizza right next door !It is just a beer n wine bar but they do have t.v.'s and they have surfing on it or on at least 1 pretty friendly spot though !< /review>

<name>KAROLINA K</name><Date>1555275120159</Date><rating>1< /rating><Review>First time I came to this karaoke bar. I spend 60$ on drinks, I was served by a nice lady (with long dark hair and glasses, don’t remember her name). After about 2 hours another bartender girl came in Jennifer , I guess she took over my tab because here is where the problem started. My friend game me her juul vape, she asked me to put it her bag not to lose it cos it’s dead. Jennifer the bartender who never introduced her self even,  in a very rude and mean way started to YELL at me: I told you vape isn’t allowed in here.  I wasn’t even vaping. I said, I’m sorry, you never told me this, and I even didn’t know she’s serving me. She started to yell at me: IM DONE, get out, I’m done I’m done! She started to yell at the security guy: Take her out!
I work in beverage industry for over 7 years in a 5 star hotel. I’ve never experienced such a bad serving attitude and service. She wasn’t professional at all, she just started to scream and yell at me using very aggressive non-respectful words. Even if Jennifer is the owner’s gf and she act like she owns the place, with guests she has no experience to talk nicely and to be polite. Customer service from her was very very bad. I spoke with the manager about this incident, she apologized about this however she couldn’t do anything because Jennifer is the owners gf so ...</Review>< Pics>

Updated Review: Previous one below was 5-stars from Aug 2015.. However, after returning and learning the bar is under new ownership you could definitely tell. Different vibe. No one doing karaoke. Unfortunately have no interest in returning. Really disappointed as it was a quaint little spot before. :(

Absolute dive bar. It's awesome. Came in on a Friday night and was greeted by the sound of Bon Jovi's "Living On A Prayer" being sung by a 22 year old female. Small space - probably only seats about 28-35 total? Anything over 30 would be pushing it. There is a pool table and the whole bar has a very opiate den vibe to it. Chill place. Normal priced beverages. Didn't see any liquor, which I have been discovering is more common in California than I expected. I think everything is done with rice wine or some sort of variant. Stick to the beer. Sad I didn't get to try the pizza as they closed before we got there.</Review>

As soon as we entered this place right away we could see that it was going to be a boring place, thee was maybe 2-3 people inside & there was no music playing, small hole in the wall did not meet my expectations as far as a bar goes.<//Text>

<review>This business is AMAZING!!!!
I was referred to IAC through USAA for a repair on my 2016 Scion tC after a  Horrible experience with Fix Auto Hemet.
Fix Auto  Claims to have aligned my car twice and repaired the front of my car after a minor collision. My car began making sounds after the repair and I did not want them to come near my car ever again.
From the moment I took my car over to International I was listened, to I was understood, I was heard, and I was helped.
The individuals who interacted with me most were the business owner Javier, Jesse and Evie at the front desk.
Not once did I ever have a situation where I felt dismissed or blown off or misunderstood. I was very particular about the repairs that had been done and not done on my car and International went above and beyond to make sure that everything was done according to my satisfaction.  My car had suffered severe misalignment in replacing of the parts and when everyone else was trying to tell me that it was OK and everything had been done right, Jesse and Javier believed me, advocated for me, and made great efforts to make sure I was happy with the work that was done.
Even more extremely helpful is the fact that they have a relationship with the Enterprise rental which is in the exact same office as their auto body shop so nobody ever has to worry about how to get home!
This business advocated for me, listen to me cry, yell, throw multiple sets and never once made me feel badd about the concerns I had and met and exceeded my expectations in getting my car back to where it needed to be.
I cannot say enough good things about Jesse and Javier... Both of these gentlemen are extremely intelligent, very in tuned with customers needs and concerns and relating these concerns to the staff that oversee the body work.  They were both very easy to talk to and very accommodating in addressing my concerns.
This location is also very family friendly as well... It's difficult enough to be dealing with car repairs and switching cars with car seats and small children and this location it and its staff were always extremely helpful and providing things for the children to be entertained with and made them feel welcomed and not inconveniences.
If you are a USAA client,  Make sure to request this shop because  they will treat your car like it's their very own!
I will be getting a spoiler installed on my car here shortly and I'm relieved to know that now I have a place to go that can do it and I will have to worry about a single thing!!!
Thank you Jesse and Javier and to the folks that worked on my car behind the scenes that put so much effort into making sure it was finally done right I owe you so much gratitude and gratefulness. I cried tears of joy all the way home yesterday and it feels like I have a brand new car all over again!  I am so happy to have my baby home put back the way she is supposed to be!!!!<//review><userid>113280282699381155628< /userid>< rating>

This post is long overdue.  My husband visited Gerber for a car bumper repair or replacement. He was pleasantly met by Eli Garcia and given the best customer service ever.  Eli was extremely professional, experienced and "tremendously helpful". We will continue to highly recommend Gerber Collision & Glass to all of our friends and family.</Review>

<text>I showed up there at 12 noon on my birthday to get an estimate. I talked to the guy who does estimates and got into a little arguement over the fact that my insurance company said that I had to go to one of there repair shops or go to my choice and pay myself. He said that they took my I insurance company, but I told him I would pay cash.... I guess he didn't like that so he purposely made me wait over an hour. I was the only customer there.
I would not recommend this business to anyone. He recked my whole birthday. I left there so.made< /text>< gmapID>

<Text>I had a quick and easy time dealing with international auto crafters . They were very professional and friendly they kept me up to date on the progress and time frame day by day .
And with the  Enterprise car rentals located in the same building,made it very easy to drop off my car and get in to a rental while repair where being made on my car.

Best experience overall with any car repair place I’ve ever had to deal with .
10/10 will use them again for any future repair . And would recommend anyone to go through international auto crafters with of there car repairs .< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Sadly had to bring in my relatively new car for some repair but this shop was nice, clean, and very professional. They only quoted me what needed to be replaced and kept the cost down. I didn’t feel nickel and dime’d. I have to say you’d never know there was any damage at all when they were done, looked just like new!</review>

<text>I must say, these guys are the real deal. I recently brought in my 2017 Dodge charger Daytona 392. It was hit in the front. These guys did such an amazing job. Perfect in every detail. The color match was on point. It is green go, and a very hard color to match. Everyone there is dressed in business casual attire, and speak like professional people. They handled the insurance with out a glitch . I recommend this shop to everyone in need of a collision repair.</text>< pics>

This shop is not dependable at all. They give you the run around, never get calls back when your suppose to. Schedule car pick ups and then never show up. They seem to only cherry pick which cars they want to work on so they can make lots of money</Review>

Very disappointed!!! I’ve been to them several times, even sent them business. Today we had an Appt to drop off my daughters car for repairs, (at the new location). I arrived 15 min early. The door was opened and I walked in. A women arrived who worked there, and made sure I knew they weren’t opened yet. Didn’t ask any questions nor offered to find out what I was there for. She blurted out that they weren’t open and she didn’t have keys for all the other cars and pointed to a row of cars.  (not sure her point on that) I  immediately could sense that she wasn’t going to pay any attention to me as a customer apparently I needed to wait 15 minutes for her to collect her self. I asked if I could drop off my daughters key, she walked over grabbed the key and asked if I was an  authorized user of the car. I asked what does that matter. She then went off telling me that I have to be an authorized user of the car to drop it off. She said in case I did further damage to the car????? WTH? Long story short ( after I vented to the manager there) I asked her for the key back told her and the manager there that there are PLENTY of other auto collision shops I will gladly take my business to! Perhaps she she leave her bad attitude at home!!< /Text>

<Review>My wife has a car there right now and it's taken almost an entire week to fix a 1 hour repair. They first told us it will be ready by Monday day since it's a small repair. This was told to us on Friday of last week. Monday comes around its not ready and they tell us for sure it will be ready by 5 on Tuesday. Then without apology they tell us on Tuesday that it won't be ready and for sure it will be done by Wednesday. Well here we are and guess what? It's still not ready, What's most upsetting is the people we have been talking to have been very unapologetic and clearly lack customer service skills. I understand things happen but we've been assured 3 separate times that it will be ready. Now there is clearly a word for this and that's called lying.<//Review>< Pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Changed date of appt initially made. Got a call asking if I was still coming. Reminded Liz that I had spoken to her the previous week and changed date. Also asked for the written estimate. Liz asked if I remembered who did the verbal and I gave her the name and amount. Another 4 days passed and called again for the written estimate.  Was told by Liz that her manager needed to sign off on it, but that she'd call me when ready, probably later that afternoon. That was 01/10/19. No call from IAC, so just now called and told Liz I would be canceling my appt for 01/21. That was all I said. She just said, "ok. I'll adjust the schedule." She never asked why, mentioned the never received written estimate or said anything else. Wpuld never, ever consider this place b/c if this is how they treat folks before getting their money, it speaks volumes as to their overall methods of operation.  Initial verbal estimate was "around $1500," so wasn't chump change.<//Review>< Time>

I had an appointment for an estimate.  When I got there, it turned out to be an appointment to drop my car off and get an estimate days later.  I had two repairs, one covered by insurance (a stractch) and the other more expensive I was paying out of pocket.  I told Eli I had a price in mind for what the repair would costs based on two previous estimates I gotten $3000.  He said it’ll probably be $4000-5000.  I said well I’m sure there are some parts of this repair that I can go without so the price can be closer to the $3000.
2 days later he finally had the estimate of the stractch, not the front because it was gonna be outside my budget.  WHAT?  What kinda fool would I be to get the stractch on my car fixed and leave the whole front end hanging off.  The problem is they don’t believe I can pay for the repair so they didn’t bother to give me an estimate!!!!!!!!!  Now I’m paying for the $150 reassemble and the car rental, then I’ll pay someone else to fix my whole car.<//review>

<Text>Was referred to this place by our insurance USAA. Been trying to call them for the past 3 days. One time they answered and left me on hold. Sent my son over for an inspection and told they are “too busy” and to go to their Lake Elsinore location! Well how about this...I’ll take my business elsewhere and will also contact USAA. If your “too busy” then you should tell the insurance companies not to send you referrals!</Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rate>

<Text>It's a mixed bag. The one off of Douglas usually has a long line on Tuesday (Value taco night) but it's worth it if you endure the wait. You unfortunately I rolled through the drive thru today (Apr 6) and was greeted by the guy saying the card reader was not working. I rolled my eyes, but understood since it was busy. Ended up going to T bell down the street.

Usually I like saying a dollar here on Tuesday/Thursdays, (Chicken taco night) sadly the long wait and inconvenient Card Reader error is making it hard for me to want to stop by this DT just to wait 15 minutes, to hear I can't use my card.< /Text>< Pics>

Keep your order simple, the workers seem to get the order wrong about 25% of the time so stick to simple items. For instance, order 1 item from value menu. Don't order a combo.  This is from my experience using the drive thru.< /Review>

Ordered their grilled chicken tacos, the sauce that comes on it tasts just like mayo and it came on only one side of the taco. Although that part happened to be a good thing because i ripped that side off, if the sauce tasted better then mayo i would have been more unsatisfied.< /text>

Great restaurant, great service. Use the phone app, food is discounted enormously, and you can use multiple coupons from the app in one transaction. Make sure you have them scan coupons that require a $5 total purchase First, then use any $3 ones, then use free item coupons next. Always scan highest first, in that order in order to get massive discounts! Happy eating 😊<//Review>

Edit: General manager called and offered a make up meal, was a better experience but not perfect. All my items we're shoved into one bag and there was still a missing item. At least when I went back this time they had ice coffee and the french fries were hot. Earned a bump up to three stars from me. Still needs improvement.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Listen folks, it's cheap fast food. I think it's good considering the price point. Also, expect a long wait on Tuesday and Thursday evenings possibly 20 mins+ in drive-through. I knew what I was getting into, but I just play on my phone while I wait to move up in line. I like the crispy chicken tacos, reminds me of the mcd's snack wrap, maybe better. I like their chicken more than their beef imo. You decide for yourself but don't judge too harshly, because for me, the value tips the scales to good.<//Review>

Went there for the Beyond meat menu, but they couldn't make half of the items because the menu changed... We just wanted an Epic Cali with Beyond, but they could only do the meat ones. We like meat, but we wanted to try out the Beyond menu so it was a frustrating experience. The outside menu also didn't have a screen to let us know what we ordered and the guy couldn't hear me! Left without a few things we wanted, but the gentleman at the window was nice enough.</Review>

<text>First time visiting a "Del Taco" and was impressed. Very similar to "Taco Bell" but with several burgers available on the menu. Fast friendly drive thru with a perfectly filled order. Dollar menu is great!! Easy to navigate location.
Full family approval! Kids enjoyed the burgers and fries while the wife and I enjoyed tacos nachos and chips.
I would rank slightly better than "Taco Bell".. "Del Taco" had more of a "fresh" taste in my opinion and a less expensive alternative.
Will definately return again soon!!< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<date>1583897244146< /date><Text>Another Del taco destination that did not disappoint. This Del taco was the freshest and cleanest that I had ever been in. There are vegan options on the menu as well as salads. The customer service was absolutely phenomenal and I got my food very quickly. I usually wait for a spell for my food, however, this location was spot-on Johnny rocket. The food came out clean and quickly. If I am in the mood for cheap Mexican inspired food, I will never go to Taco Bell again. I live one mile away from this location and it will be my location for all of my munchie meals. #420< /Text>< username>

Slow service, waited an extra 10 minutes for cold, floppy re-fries. I thought at least with the wait, the fries would be hot and crispy, instead they were yesterday's fries. Never received a receipt (but they knew I couldn't reference my experience with one). It was at Roseville, today Monday July 27th at about 2:30pm. I feel bad for the crew, obviously they are treated poorly and are paid horribly and that's why they give horrible service and serve up yesterday's food. I would not return to this location for wrinkly, brown, cold fries. Anywhere else is better.<//Text>

I agree with most people that have reviewed this place. Very nice staff and I mean entire staff! All of the food here has been on par forever. This store is located next to Carl's JR and has plenty of parking.</Review>

On the app after I finished choosing what I was going to order, the app said there was something I got that they didn't have anymore. So I called Del Taco to see what that was. The girl was rude and said she couldn't help me. She even got rough when me when I was trying to explain my predicament. Then I just ordered the food anyway, and when I received it. (Which took forever) Everything was cold, and soggy and gross. I called Del Taco, and they said I had to make a complaint through Uber Eats because they were help responsible for the meal if you order through them. REDICULOUSLY RUDE<//Review>< response>

<review>Today I went to Del Taco after looking online and seeing that they were supposed to be open for Dine in, unfortunately all of the doors were locked. I figured it must be open because there was a child inside running around with food in his hand. When I called the restaurant the rude associate informed me that it was drive thru only. I’m sure that should be advertised</review></record>

In the drivethru tonight I  pay and the girl asks me to pull around and wait in a parking spot. There's no  car behind me in line. I say, how about I move if someone comes behind me. She says no. I say how long is it going to be? She says less then a minute. I go and park. No other car pulls into the drivethru. Less than a minute later she's walking out to my car with the tacos. I look into bag. No napkins. She's gone. I get out of my car, walk around to the entrance, go inside and wait two minutes for someone to give me a couple of napkins. Weird.</Review>

Always check your bag because 50% of the time I don't get half my order.  This time they stuffed my 1 bag so full I couldn't check it... low and behold much of the order is missing so I guess I'm going hungry again.<//text>

Good healthy food. Now they serve beyond meat. Everything is fresh and clean tasting.
Good prices and offers senior discount. A real value. Good for vegitarians.</text>

<Time>1568322096238<//Time><Pics>None<//Pics><text>Good American style mexican food. Decent price and quick service. A lot better tasting fresh food then other similar fast food places.

Rarely have any problems with moding orders to taste. The grilled chicken soft tacos and burrito are way better without the white sauce. They have good marinated grilled chicken, the white sauce kills that flavor, best to exclude the sauce or replace with the red sauce.< /text><userid>109570333088006559747<//userid>< gmapID>

Marginal at best. What do you expect for a cheap fast food hole? Burrito was room temperature, fries were stone cold (tossed them out.) Hey, at least I didn't get sick.<//Text>

Still, visiting is like coming to the staff's home for dinner and it's thoroughly unpretentious and welcoming.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I think Del Taco stacks up french fries (soggy) to keep the line going or (uncooked) too speedy. Give your people time to deliver perfectly crisp fries...Its the only negative.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3guRH61elY1AhtkSUqb_DSMHX37ckIrVqlzpR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<Review>Taco Tuesday Rocks!  But it could be cleaner inside.  Employees are very nice, but a little grungy.  Location invites some of the local transient population which can make for an interesting meal out with the family.   Just wish they had more locations! !< /Review>< Response>

Their bean & cheese burritos are awesome (especially with extra cheese) and they are only a buck for 1 pound of food.  Their French fries are awesome too.  Way better than taco bell but their hot sauce isn't great.<//review>

<text>Place was clean and staff was nice but Its a bit ridiculous to add .50 cents per taco for a triple taco order. Not a single taco on the menu came with lettuce cheese tomatoes and sour cream..which is like a standard taco. The grilled chicken in my taco wasn't the greatest. I wouldn't come here again.< /text>< Pics>

I had a value taco which broke in half immediately, a chicken taco with far too little chicken and far too much sour cream, multiple tacos had wildly scattered ingredients, such as all the cheese clustered on one side.

A very good place for some Mexican fast food. Very customer friendly. Food is good and delicious. I love their combination burritos, tacos and churros. I like all their food. Place is clean and tidy. Service is very good. Best Del Taco in the area.</Text>

Even though i really dont like Del Taco I decided to give it another shot. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. Its been a good decade since ive walked into any Del Taco so i was a little leery about eating here.</Text>

They have long term employees that care. I love the cali steak and quac, any nachos, obviously chicken soft tacos on thursdays cuz theyre cheap and delicious. If you are broke, the $1 grillers are great too. Small dining area but most grab and go here so plenty of room to sit and eat. Breakfast wise grab an epic burrito.... cheap and filling and bomb!<//review>< Rating>

<review>I don't know what has occurred here but this location has gone from great to horrible in the past two months. Dirty store, extremely slow service, and cold food. I just waited 45 minutes in the drive thru... There was only 5 cars in it and nobody inside. Employees seemed to be just be sitting around. None of the orders were large.< /review>< user_id>

Their egg-filled burritos are my favorite breakfast.  I frequently order them in a bowl without the big tortilla and avoid 270 calories of lard and flour (yep, that's what they're made of).  The staff are outstanding and handle my "customized" orders with a smile.</Review>

Tried their Beyond burrito and the 'meat' is as runny as weinerszitel 'chili'. I've had Beyond Meat/Beef products and Del Taco corrupted it or are watering it down. Changed it from a 3 to a 2. I was here recently and the lights are out on the outside, the menu isn't well lit and today I pull up and their "system is down" for unforeseen time. 10min? My death? And the lights are still out and menu still unlit. Sub par.< /Text>

Their tacos aren't even crunchy. Food just wasn't tasty at all. NEVER going to any Del Taco, we had to throw away 5 tacos bc the tacos weren't crunchy enough just too basic and beans were hard to eat.</review>

<text>2nd time in 20 years, barely anything has changed

I didn't like it then and it appears to have not improved.  Order was wrong, several items.  Food was edible but not tasty.  Ordered the 8 layer burrito with Beyond Meat, got a Beef and Cheese Burrito.

It seems like a popular location, maybe the other customers don't mind multiple mistakes, and just like the food.

Recommendation: Stop the complicated naming. Stick to Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla, etc...< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Went to Del Taco after we were rudely turned away at Baja Fresh. (Woman decided not to serve a 12 year old girl 20 minutes before closing bc she was too lazy) Food was good. Window guy was...overly "happy" I think to cover up his irritation with being at work. I get it. Work sucks. Best thing tho...they got my order of 12 different items RIGHT. So big kudos for that.< /Review>< Rating>

Some fast food places you go to different ones but the same fast food name, and it Lwa uh s tastes different. In this case, every Del Taco I got to is on point with the food tasting exactly on point. This Del Taco however was very clean, quick with taking people's orders, and quick t ok get your food. This is an awesome place to eat if your looking for something quick and easy, Del Taco is the spot!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I like Del Taco in general, but it is frustrating when quality differs between locations. Thankfully I can report, this location definitely did not disappoint.  The place was clean, the worker was very friendly (and since it was late and thus not crowded, even brought our orders over to the table), and most importantly the food was PERFECT.  Now how often can you say that when going to a fast food restaurant?!

Unfortunately for us this location is about a half hour even when the traffic is good.  But nonetheless, I have to say our first visit was excellent.  And whenever we find ourselves in the Roseville area again, we'll be sure to make it the first of many!</text>

Decent food and quick service just keep in mind that the drive-thru will be busy around 12 to 1 and again around 4 to 7 so you can probably go inside to get faster service around those times!</Review>

<text>The lobby was empty which would be a good time to clean the lobby. I was the only customer there. One girl came out to wash the glass on one of the entry doors but never cleaned the floors. Yuck< /text><userid>103902701233008335973< /userid></record>

It took 26 minutes for us to lose patience and ask them when our food would be ready. The guy was real apologetic... but still said there was another order before ours... the manager walked by with nasty look on her face as she kicked a crumpled bag out of her way long with the other garbage on the floor... we asked for our money back.</Review>

< Review>
I went to this location 2 days in a row and there areproblems at this location. First day waited 20 min in line at the Drive thru. ordered2 of The Del Tacos. shells cracked and hardly any cheese at all. paid 1.50 each. mgr said come back& they would replace my meal. I return today and the Tacos were cracked even more and the kid at the window was throwing ghings around and being very cocky& rude. I am done with this location</Review>

I was upset when the worker didn't give me the sauce I asked for multiple times. I even whipped out the phone to record them.

Manger was sweet enough to give the meal for free.<//text>

<Text>Food is usually made with care here. Occasionally a limp salad. Their food looks and tastes fresher than at their competitor. Lets be honest, this isn't really Mexican food, but for what it is - drive thru, healthier choices available, reasonably priced menu - is good.</Text>< pics>

Today was first time I've been here in a few months. Was really surprised the service was great , the food correct and the fries or extra crispy just like I asked for! They get 5 stars for the service in the new revamped menu.< /Text>

< Review>
Worst fast food experience to date...last customer inside maybe the reason but there is no excuse for the massive amou t of food and trash in the floor in the kitchen area...for some reason we still ordered...first 3 things we asked about they didnt want to cook because it was to close to close but we could order the couple things sitting cold on the stove...i ordered a asada burrito and got a chilli and potato wedge burrito that tasted like the kitchen looked.... We ordered $30 worth of food between 3 people...no body got thru their first item...and the rest we threw away at Carl's Jr..across the parking lot.....wish my hadn't been dead or the pics would be all over ...first del taco experience will probably be my last...and I was so excited to try it!!!< /Review>

Friendly workers, good food, and rarely mess up on the orders (but be sure to check your bags before you leave, just in case). ;) The only downfall for me is that they don't have a lot of "Pescatarian (a person who does not eat meat, but does eat fish)" options...the fish tacos. That's my go-to. haha Anyway, it's good!</review>

It was chicken taco night and it took 35 min. To get 2 tacos and a burrito and the manager was apologizing to everybody and offering people free coke or fries or whatever but when he got to me he called my number and walked away without any apology. So I will never go there again.< /text>

<text>There lucky to get 1 star from me. I drove down the street to Carl's Jrs, after seeing this place had an outside bathroom with a payment for coins to use it??? What kind of place is this, that charges you to use the restroom?? All I wanted was to wash my hands before I ate there.</text>< GmapID>

Slowest drive thru in Roseville. They often forget to ask me If I need sauce and the food has come out cold on numerous ocassions. I like my quesadillas to be hot and fresh. Don't think I'll be stopping at this location anytime soon until they speed up the drive thru time, I can't wait 20 minutes for 3 quesadillas.< /review>

I always like del taco. The one on Douglas is slower than the one on Alhambra in Sacramento which is curious because they have more workers.they give more cheese on things than taco bell usually but the one on Alhambra is even better.< /review>

I visited several months ago and had several health code concerns that I contacted corporate about. Last week I went 1/2 hour out my way just to go there. Although one of my concerns looked as if it was addressed (bathroom had cigarette butts on the floor, torn up brilo pads, bloody napkins). The others looked the same (food prep area counter's and floors look like they haven't been cleaned in days, homeless people napping at outside table and pacing up & down sidewalk next to windows).  I will never eat there again and have told friends and family to stay away from that location</review>

<text>Food itself was eadible and we didn't get sick from it, so I suppose that's good. However, it was very greasy (moreso than other taquerias), bland and lacked complexity in it's flavor. Better than other fast food taco chains, but still a fast food taco chain, so don't expect much. It was the only place around to grab something quick out our way to Tahoe and went in with low expectations (the place being a fast food chain and all), so we weren't disappointed. You get what you pay for... "Authentic" Mexican food it isn't, but it's fast, cheap and clean. Oh, no public restroom there.</text><gmapID>0x809b201e17a18231:0x629fb84a4f155f02<//gmapID>< Response>

Say no onions -  they put extra, ordered 12 mini quesadillas - they gave us 11, asked for green sauce - they said ok and gave us none. Above all that the drive-thru person's attitude was not very customer friendly. Highly disappointed and cheated< /Review>

Went to this Del Taco at 11:45pm. The speaker played the "please come back when we're open" message. They're supposed to be open until midnight.  Of the 3 cars in front of me, only the front 2 had orders. And another car pulled in behind me! So its not like they were completely dead & closed early. I wont go back to this location.</Text>

Ordered and then told at window they're out of shells for the burritos I ordered.  The burritos I ended up with lack filling. I had more tortillas than I did eggs, cheese and band bacon. The service lacked and my total time feo ordering to the bag reaching my hand, took them a total of 16min and 47 min<//text>

This place is ridiculous I came here on a Sunday night at 11 p.m. to pick up a doordash order and they ran out of chicken and steak and majority of the list of order that I had to get was Chicken in there and it's insane how they ran out of chicken and steak too!! 👎👎</Review>
