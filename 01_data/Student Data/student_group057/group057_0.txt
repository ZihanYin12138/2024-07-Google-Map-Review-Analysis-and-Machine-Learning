Between the relatively 'sceneic' exercise trail around the exterior of park; spacious fields for soccer or baseball activities; solo tennis court.....and executive 3-part playground for the wee lil lads- I'd say this park has a great blend of everything for every type of person wanting to enjoy the urban outdoors.
The bathrooms are done by [www . publicrestroomcompany . com] ...so you know that the facilities are gonna be reliably in order. Lol

HOWEVER~
This park gets only a 4/5 star rating from me because of the dyslexic design of the basketball 'court' .... The court is shaped like a boomerang and requires you to shoot free throws 2.5 feet's to the left in order to be straight-on with the hoop. Any real hooper dribbling around on this court would feel awkward. Oh, and one of the rims is so loosey goosey (rattles every non-swish shot)...you better hope u score the 1 good hoop or you've just flushed your practice sesh. Attached are pics of the botched bball court ..

PS contrary to popular belief, the morning physical trainer guy isn't that bad. Just tell him that he's in the way. He'll move.<//Text>

This was a very good park. Not too crowded, and when many people came, the large space was able to accommodate all of them with ease. The playground is spaced out along with a giant grassy area. There are workout stations along the flowing sidewalk, and most of the people there are nice.< /Review>

<text>It's always occupied here. Never any place that's quiet on the weekends. Never any parking people walking across the street so there is no parking. People use this as a party place and it's not even well equipped for that kind of thing. It's more of a neighborhood park for runners and walkers not for parties. The sad thing is the grass is always torn up and there is always renovation here because of so many people abusing this park.< /text>< pics>

<review>The only reason I'm taking away a star is because more times than not the grass is closed. Otherwise it's a great park! The location over looks a cemetery, and has a lot of visitors. They also have adult work out gear and a tennis court. Watch out for Saturday mornings though, because the field is taken over by soccer games.< /review>< gmapID>

It is spacious enough for children to play and run around without getting hurt or bumping into each other. Plus, there idea "jungle gym" and slide for their enjoyment. Rest rooms are handy to the shelters that older folks have easy access. Overall, a great park.</Text>

Lots to do here. Green grass, shade trees, bathrooms, bbq, and tables.  A large sidewalk loop for the kids to ride on while we can still supervise them and there are exercise equipment with instructions for use.  Plan ahead for parties and reserve through the city.< /text>

<Time>1457192677539< /Time><text>Great park for families. Like some of the parks of the area, the locals feel that they own the park. For example, I lived right down the street, nonetheless, if you went there and you weren't from across the street from the park, and people didn't know you, some people were a little snobby. My children were playing with some other kids and the parents actually said, "you don't know them, or where they live, so don't play with those children." Anyway, some of the parks in this area people can they get a little territorial, which is sometimes understandable.</text>< Rate>

Evelyn is absolutely so great to work with!  This is my third time renting a storage unit at StorQuest and I have to say, she is one of the main reasons I don’t even consider looking at other locations.  Evelyn is incredibly friendly, even after years have passed, she always remembers who I am (which is such a nice touch), is very helpful, quick but yet thorough with the paperwork and runs the entire place so smoothly.  She has gone out of her way to help me on several occasions and I really, really appreciate it.  StorQuest is an entirely wonderful place to rent from.  I highly recommended it!</Review>

I was able to quickly reach a live person to talk to the details of my storage space and move in process. The facility is clean and very professionally run. Evelyn was friendly and great to work with. Highly recommend.< /text>

<text>(On behalf of. customer Valarie V. )
I cannot day enough about the wonderful customer service that Stirequest provides.
Evelyn ( the mgr),  is an absolute angel!!! She has made what could have been   a stressful experience -  a  wonderful one instead!  In fact , I chose StoreQwest  , among several other company’s because of her kindness, efficiency and professionalism!
It’s rare , especially in these times to find someone so  helpful and professional. while keeping heart in everything she does for the customer.  Evelyn  is the BEST!
I highly recommend this this  co- you’ll love the experience there- thanks to Evelyn and her great staff!<//text>< Pictures>

<review>BE MINDFUL OF UNEXPECTED CLOSURES--I was left waiting for over an hour and a half on move-in day with my hourly movers & truck while the single attendant took a 2 hour lunch break--all during normal operating hours. I showed up at 1:25pm with my movers to find a closed and locked office with a sign saying they'd be back at 3pm. I had spoken with the location manager the day prior notifying her of my expected moving truck arrival time for the next day and was told there was no need to schedule an arrival time, they would be there all day to let us into our unit. Unfortunately, someone was sick and the single attendant took a long break leaving the facility unattended for hours. I had movers on the clock and no one called me to let me know about the closures even though they knew I was coming in with movers that day.
This is obviously a very unfortunate one-off situation, but it would not happen at a larger storage facility so it's something to keep in mind when considering options. Management's handling of the situation has been disappointing--it has been a week since the incident and I have not heard from the District Manager about how they will remedy the situation.<//review>< pics>

Evelyn at StorQuest was absolutely awesome in assisting us in finding the perfect storage unit for our needs. Evelyn was very informative, answered all of our questions/concerns. Was a delight to work with and she made us feel very welcome. I totally recommend in using this facility. It’s is very well maintained and clean. No sign of any rodents at all! Which is highly important! Thank you again Evelyn for all your help and making us feel very welcomed!

<text>Let me take a minute to describe just how amazing Evelyn has been for us. She definitely went above and beyond, and is the very best at her job...  Evelyn took such good care of me, let me see if I can find the words to describe just how amazing she is, "exceptional, amazing, excellent, fantastic, through, competent, knowledgeable", etc... Mere words cannot express the wonderful job that Evelyn actually does. She helped me save over $100.00 a month, and the facility is always soo nice and clean, and I feel like I am going to see family anytime I arrive at StorQuest in San Rafael.. Thank you Evelyn for taking such great care of us...  You're the BEST, and I am going to let everyone I know just how great you and your company treat people... :-)
Best Regards,

My personal affects have been secure, accessible for me since..."wow, how long has it been Evelyn, 2017 or so?" . I continue to do business with No misfortune or unfortunate issues.

Nice facility, clean and well kept. Very helpful, knowledgeable staff lead by Evelyn. Accommodating to every inquiry regarding storage, if they weren't certain the staff referred to the other location for support.

I have two units located here for my residential goods. I feel my belongings will be safe until I am ready to move them.< /text>

<review>Evelyn was very kind and helpful during this process. She was very communicative leading up and we were able to put the unit on reserve for a week while we were making the final decision.

I had a great experience working with Evelyn today. She has been extremely clear, helpful and friendly. It is becoming harder and harder to find friendly and helpful individuals who are providing service over the phone these days and this was a very refreshing experience. I highly recommend StorQuest for your self storage needs.< /review>

I moved some of our furnishings into our storage unit for the first time today, with trepidation. . . we have never needed a storage facility before so I had some reservations about the process, costs, quality, etc.  Evelyn, the manager, was incredibly thorough, kind, patient and welcoming -- I have the utmost confidence that we made the right choice.  She took her time to show my husband and I several units and made candid recommendations based on our individual needs.
StorQuest on Gary Place is super easy to access from the freeway; their rates are better than competitive, and I will not worry about our belongings while they're in this facility.  Highly recommend.</Text>

I have had two storage units at this facility for over nine years before StorQuest purchased it a couple of years ago. SQ made some amazing changes. The building was repainted, the management office neatened up and the entire facility cleaned up in general. I’d had a rodent problem in one of my units and the first thing the new management did was to clear away all of the bushes from the grounds where vermin like to live. I never had any complaints about the facility before SQ took over, but the changes are so positive that I’m happy they did!</text>

The staff at Storquest were so kind and understanding! My colleague and I went in to ask them to donate a space for a local holiday toy drive so we could keep our toys safe during collection. We had worked with the previous owners but never with them. We were delighted that they agreed to support our efforts! They waived the fee and we’re so gracious about it!< /Text>

<review>The service reps are very friendly and attentive to their customers, which I've found to be rare in the storage rental industry. When I booked a unit, the rep was late and gave me a discount off my first month - great way to make up for lost time! And when I moved in, the reps were very courteous throughout the experience. It also helps that they have the lowest rates in town.< /review><Response>{'time': 1502640018683, 'text': 'Matthew – thank you so much for sharing a little bit about your storage journey with StorQuest.

Wow! This place is great it seemed like I received the runaround at just about every other storage company I called, or limited space, or limited knowledge, or an attitude from the employee, NOT here, Evelyn was amazing, not only did she help me get it all figured out, she actually listened to my needs and help me save money, I am SOO GRATEFUL for her EXCEPTIONAL service, and I would recommend StorQuest, (and ESPECIALLY EVELYN) to anyone in the market for self-storage, they absolutely ROCK, Evelyn should be given a raise, and you all should know how valuable she really is. THANKS EVELYN!

Molé at Chez Shea in Half Moon Bay!
Thanks everyone for a delicious dinner and excellent service!

I have eaten LOTS of molé. This plate goodness is well balanced and satisfying. So much so I was scraping the plate for every bit of sauce. Next time I will ask for a extra tortilla to mop up the plate!

A glass of zinfandel suited the flavors. At same time enhancing the spice molé giving it a little more kick.  Order some if you have the molé.

Sat at the window bar to watch the world go by.  And come in too.

Enjoyed the Lavender Crème Brûlée. Tasty lavender flavor plainly apparent, but not overpowering.

Nice to see Chez Shea is a dog friendly place.  After watching a few go to the patio I walked back to  check out the area.  Cute tables and a few dog dishes as well.  The four-footed family members will feel at home during the meal.

Bar setting where I enjoyed my meal was clean and neat.

Bathrooms are kept up well.  You can send you kids in without worry.

The staff was full of smiles.

The other patrons were full of life and happy chatting.

All of this makes Chez Shea an upbeat and tasty place to entertain you mouth and your mind.  I recommend this place and will be back.

The food was okay but didn't seem like anything special. Saw some salads that looked very fresh though and the fish and chips on others plates looked good. Service was not terribly impressive and the atmosphere was nothing special. Perhaps their tapas offerings are elevated but we were too early for those.<//review>

<Review>Great enchiladas, and the green sauce that comes with it is great. Remember to order at the counter because they will not take your order from your seat. Also, the fresh OJ is really good!< /Review>< Rating>

The "spicy" haberno salsa was not spicy, and I wasn't impressed with the falafel, it was chewy. However, the staff was friendly and polite. Perhaps other dishes are better but I'm not motivated to come back.</review>

This is in ok cafe along Main St in Half Moon Bay. They have an eclectic menu with various ethnic dishes. I thought it was going to be a fusion type place, but there wasn't really any mixing between the ethnic styles. I was a bit underwhelmed with the vegetarian options. They have options, they just didn't have that much flavor.</Review>

<review>Had breakfast here in our way to Santa Cruz. The pastor tacos were unexpectedly filled to the gills with the pastor pork, carmelized onion, and pineapple I think it was. Served with sides of rice and black beans. Also tried the huevos rancheros which was great. The tortillas stayed crunchy despite being burried under the eggs and sauce and beans. My only complaints was the eggs were cooked over medium well versus sunnyside up which I'm more accostomed to with huevos rancheros.</review>< Gmap_id>

Although the sign says "eclectic", and indeed some dishes are slightly less conventional, this is much more good, solid mom & pop cuisine for slightly more daring families.
If you expect avant-garde fusion, this is not your place.
Nouvelle cuisine this ain't, but rather a very good, place for interesting food with a Mexican heritage.
Everything we had tasted very good, was well executed and tasted freshly made.
Even the chips and salsa, with the salsa nice and hot, not just out of a can.
Definitely a place we'll visit again.
Before you get upset because they're not serving you, please note the Order Here sign, you order at the counter, not the table.</Text>

Opted for the ceviche tostada ($11.95) and tamales ($13.95).
Ceviche was very refreshing, with the fresh white fish and shrimp tasting spectacular among the diced onions, cilantro, and tomatoes. Tostadas were toasted well. My only gripe about this dish is that they put too much lime in it, to the point where it was all I could taste. If there was an option to have lime on the side so I could add as much as I wanted, that would be nice.
Tamales were on point! Pork mole was excellent, and the chicken chile verde was moist and not too stringy. But the winner of this dish had to be the rice and the slight kick it brought with each bite.< /text>

< review>
Rude service at lunch, where you have to order at the register.  Rushed by the cashier who gave the wrong change and then argued about it.  Accused my wife of putting the missing money in the tip jar.

Mushroom fajita was not good, and maybe 1/2 of a portabello mushroom plus tea for $15.

We've had hit or miss experiences here.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>So to start when this place moved to Westlake the pricing was on the high end! So high I avoided this place for a while but when my friends told me to give it a second chance a few months later I have to say I was wrong. This place is great!!!

The prices are super competitive and they have a fantastic variety in stock. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable in almost everything they carry.

They only thing I can say that's not up to par is the singles selection and the players that go there but I expect that to change over time.

All in all if you  are not shopping here you are missing out. Give them a call and talk to them, you wont be disappointed.</review>< Pics>

This place is really cool for Magic the Gathering. It reminds me of my time visiting Star City Games in Roanoke, VA. They are that good. They give fair pricing on pre-orders, they sell singles based on TCG player prices, they do Friday Night Magic with extra prizes (in Discord during this Pandemic time), their Magic community knows what they are talking about, and their staff answers all questions through phone, Discord, or in person. They also have a lot of nice board games and I bought a couple from here. I missed Magic the Gathering when I came to Ventura County and visited a couple of shops around here, but I would say that these guys do it the best in this county. I believe this so much so that I have been willing to make the extra long trip from west Ventura to visit this store.<//text>

The selection here was the best I've found. He showed me at least 10 games that would be playable solo. Some of the other stores I've been in couldn't even suggest 1 game, let alone 10!
I bought a game and a pack of card sleeves. Eric even explained to me why I didn't need all the sleeves suggested on the box. Great first experience! Will definitely return.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1572582111202, 'text': 'Thank you so much Ken for taking the time to review us. We greatly value and appreciate your feedback!

Tons of games workshop and other miniature table top pieces. Decent selection of board games and magic cards. Carried some cards I had a hard time finding else where. Prices are decent and seems they do tons of groups. Only negative I would say is the Google mapping directions points you to a side street 100 yards away from the store itself so be warned now to ignore the last step and just navigate to the pavilions that is right next to it.< /text>

Very welcoming experience for a new person wanting to learn and sort or card game or board game. Will be my only go to store for now on.

<Review>Wish the selection was better but as these places tend to be few and far between I won't complain too much. It's often busy but the employees are always helpful and the community seems nice.

Response to the Owner: My friends and I are always looking for more Dnd accessories. A bigger selection of miniatures is always of use to us. It's better than what it use to be but I will always push for more Dnd stuff.</Review>< rating>

I came in wanting to get back into Magic after 15+ years away from the game. The man helping me didn't want to up sell me but rather to see what format I wanted to get into and discussed new mechanics before I made a purchase. The store is tidey and whatever your flavor of gaming; it'll be easy to find. They're events list is expansive and easy to navigate, so looking into that is a must. 5 stars for this gaming haven.

Awesome atmosphere and place to hang out, did a couple of FNM here and everyone was super nice and pleasant to be around. They had a ton of other board games I have never heard of but looked like a ton of fun to try.</Review>

Great shop. Friendly. Clean. Tons of options for a small place. Prices were appropriate for a brick and mortar store, but come with that extra service you should expect.</Review>

Small shop but friendly staff. Room to play pretty much any game you'd like, plus a very large game library. Little small on the community side, but was talking with the staff and they are still trying to build their scene since moving from Northridge.< /text>

Great place to stop by on certain weekends for WH40k, the people who work here on those days are great. But don't come here on the weekdays, one of the workers named "Dom" is a miserable man-child loser who gets very emotional and passive aggressive when things don't go his way, and certainly don't play with the guy, I've personally seen him yell at the people he works/plays with. Their merchandise is sometimes damaged and they don't like accepting returns. I can't comment on the magic community.< /Text>

All the locations near my house either closed down or stopped investing in minatures and models. Luckily for me I found Game Ogre and this place is AWESOME! With the help of Brian he was able to point out every single color I needed in order for me to achieve my specific color scheme. After painting my pieces I'm even more ecstatic about my purchases.

If anyone plays Warmachines/Hordes lmk!!

<Rate>2</Rate><review>I've stopped by here 5 or 6 times over the past couple years.  EVERY time there are a bunch of guys playing a game at the table right in the middle of the store, using very profane language ... fbombs every few seconds.  Do NOT take kids here.  Very inappropriate.  It's sad that the management doesn't seem to care.  Regarding the games they sell here ... an OK selection, with average prices for a walk-in store.   They are only a couple miles from JJs game lounge and Njoy us Games, both of which have very nice, kid friendly atmospheres and larger selections.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>Always a pleasure to come and see Eric.  He takes care of veteran's, and gave me a great deal on a set of tires for two vehicles! Nice warranty, and they repair flats for free with the set's. Can't go wrong really. Can also customize your setup with a nice selection of rims. If you're a little short on cash, they do offer a credit program too help you get back on the road safely!<//Text>< pics>

Mike, from Choco Studios, was our wedding photographer for our San Francisco City Hall ceremony in November 2017. While there are many aspects that make a wedding special and memorable, for us, having great photographs was paramount. For this reason, we selected City Hall, Baker Beach, the Palace of Fine Arts, a Cable Car, and the Fairmount Hotel for our settings. But, it the brilliance and skill of the photographer that create those unforgettable images. I knew just looking at Mike's photos on the Choco website that he was exactly what we were looking for: beautiful, stunning imagery. While we had high expectations from the start, when we received out photos, we could not believe how incredible there were. In addition, it was a joy to work so closely with Mike, he was gentle in constructing each image, thanks us for every set of pictures he took, and durning the ceremony so unobtrusive we didn't even realize he was capturing such wonderful moments with this camera. I can't imagine there there is anyone that could have taken better photos, and we realize choosing Choco Studios was the most important decision we made, because now we have the most amazing photos to last a lifetime and beyond. It was impossible to select the best images to share, all were so wonderful.

Mike/Choco Studio Photography did such a great job with our SF City Hall wedding photos and I'm so glad I found them online! We chose the three-location package and after the quick ceremony, Mike took photos of us at Palace of Fine Arts (Perfect suggestion, Mike!) and whilst on the holiday-themed trolley we rented after our wedding. I am so glad Mike allowed us to be comfortable the whole time and not make us do cheesy awkward poses. All the shots he took were very artistic and his angles were very unique and captured the joyful and celebrating mood we had that day that we had such a hard time selecting which photos are going to make it to our wedding announcement and our hallway! :D I highly recommend Choco Studio Photography if you want a unique yet natural and laid back style for your special occasion photos. I''ve included three of our favorite photos here as proof. Thank you again Mike for capturing our special day - Karla and Tyson</Text>

<Review>Mike and Nat have captured some of the most important events of our lives since 2009. We chose to work with them for our wedding, and loved how professional, but warm and personable they were. My husband and I are both uncomfortable in front of the camera, and they were able to capture us at our best and most natural by putting us at ease, especially in high stress situations. Here is a picture they took of us minutes after my missing wedding dress was recovered (wedding is running 1.5 hours late, cortisol levels are sky high, etc.) by quickly making us comfortable and happy again to be our best for the photos. Not a single person has walked into our home and not complemented on our "stunning" wedding pictures.
We loved them so much that they were my sister's wedding photographers as well. We saw them again recently for holiday photos of our now family of three, and hope to work with them for many years to come.
Thank you Nat and Mike for capturing such beautiful photos of the important milestones in our lives - we love you guys!</Review>< Resp>

Mike and Nat shot my wedding a month ago and I could not imagine a better wedding photo-shooting experience. They were an absolute pleasure to work with and consummate professionals who took some of the best photos I've ever seen of myself, friends, and family, that I will cherish for the rest of my life. It's Mike and Nat's fault that I'm that guy that's constantly showing everyone his wedding photos. I'm a monster!!</review>

Natasha was amazing to work with. She was extremely familiar with the San Francisco City Hall and knew where to go to get the best pictures in the building.  Her knowledge of the local area was also vital in getting some great shots out in town near the Golden Gate Bridge too.< /Review>

Choco Studio photographed my wedding, and we are thrilled with the results. They captured all aspects of the day perfectly - beautifully framed shots, lots of unique perspectives, and very well processed images. It was great working with Mike and Nat in the lead-up to the event, and during the event itself, the Choco team provided clear guidance, were happy to accommodate specific requests, and used their professional judgment when needed to make sure our photos turned out great. Having two photographers was a huge plus - no moments missed, and great angles for everything. I highly recommend Choco Studio for top-notch photographs and an overall fantastic experience.
Side note: This was an LGBTQ (gay) wedding. My husband and I, and our guests, always felt comfortable and accepted by the Choco team.< /review>

<Text>We selected Choco Studio after searching through dozens of photographers' websites. Choosing to work with Mike and Nat was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From initial contact, to engagement photos, to the final editing on our album, Mike and Nat provided a professional and stress-free experience.

Mike took our engagement pictures a few months before the wedding.  I highly recommend taking those pictures early.  The pictures turned out incredibly well, and we felt even more confident in choosing Mike and Nat once we saw the results they were capable of producing. I used the engagement pictures for our guest book. People loved looking through those pictures at our wedding reception.

We gambled with the weather on our wedding day, but it turned out perfect for photos. Mike and Nat were able to quickly adjust to the changing light conditions and I noticed how they worked seamlessly as a team to notice and adjust settings accordingly.  Additionally, Mike and Nat made us both feel very comfortable and relaxed while we were being photographed. They were both able to work with us  to capture the most flattering and natural pictures possible.

We love the beautiful photos and emotions Mike and Nat captured throughout our day. The pictures reflect both the overall feel of the wedding and the small details I had spent countless hours planning. Mike and Nat are both incredibly talented, and it was a pleasure working with them.

(P.S. Brides - if you're looking to have bridal boudoir photos done, I recommend working with Nat!)<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>We only engaged Natasha for a couple of hours for a large elopement party, but she was still every bit as helpful as I imagine should would have been for a large daylong event. We discussed details and styles at length before the event, and she checked in to make sure she was getting all the shots we wanted.

She suggested a few compositions and they came out magnificently. I only regret not keeping her on for a few more hours. Her styling and framing are beautiful.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
After a horrible night of stomach poisoning prior to the day of my wedding, the last thing I hoped for is good pictures.  My biggest concern was to not fall asleep during my vows or into my cake.  I felt horrible, puffy, and tired.  I no longer expected for things to go smoothly as planned and some things did not.  However none of those things included the work of Mike and Nat with Choco Studio.  Everything about their work seemed so effortless.  They were punctual, attentive, carrying, non-intrusive, professional, and much more.  I never expected to look at my pictures and feel as beautiful as I did.  I don't think I knew how much in love my husband was with me until I saw the first look pics.  They were able to capture the love, the beauty, and the honesty that I really wanted to see.  We have so many favorite pictures from the wedding.  We truly enjoy looking at them, which we do often and remember all the emotions of the event.  Being bride and groom, it is very difficult to stop and reflect in the moment on everything that is happening at your wedding; the chaos is to great; these photos will forever help me to do just that, reflect and remember, and for that I am grateful to Mike and Nat.<//Review>

<text>We hired Mike for our weekday SF City Hall wedding and we're so glad we did. From the moment I contacted him, he was easy to get a hold of and quick with responses, whether it was through email or phone. And Mike was always very helpful in answering any questions we had be it about timing or photography suggestions.

One of the best things about Mike is just how comfortable he made my husband and I feel throughout the whole day. With the pre-ceremony time going by quickly and my head in all sorts of directions, he was able to keep us calm and reminded us to just breathe.

The photos turned out beautiful and the turn-around time was exactly as he quoted--two weeks! If you're looking for a wedding photographer, we highly recommend Choco Studio. Just wonderful customer service, amazing photography and true professionalism!< /text><time>1518310472376</time><UserId.>117221744791004584412</UserId.><rate>5< /rate></record>

<Review>My wife and I hired Mike and Nat for both our engagement photos and our wedding.  They were wonderful to work with!  Doing engagement photos before the wedding was perfect, because we were able to meet with them and work together before the big day.  It definitely made things easier for us on the wedding day.  I also appreciated that they always took time to make sure we felt comfortable and were ready to look our best.  They are very professional and take fantastic pictures!< /Review>< Rating>

We were lucky enough to know Mike and Nat personally and we knew that they would be a perfect fit for us. Photography was one of the most important aspects of our wedding. We had been following their blog and were always amazed at the images they produced.

Choco studio has a knack for capturing the most memorable, emotional and funny moments and a special talent of creating magical photographs.

While working with Choco studio we noticed that they have mastered not only the artistic part of their work, but the business and organizational side as well. They created an effortless workflow from the moment we booked them to the moment we received our photographs. They were reliable, ready to answer our questions and give us useful recommendations and suggestions.

The only problem: we've got so many great images now, that it's hard to choose favorites for wall prints :)</Review>

Service: Like all of the wedding vendors, it was difficult to decipher which photographer to choose (especially when you don't know anything about photography, and all the photos start to look the same).  We met with several photographers before meeting Mike and Nat, but we weren't swept away, and we wanted to be as it was one of the larger expenses.  I chose to meet with Mike and Nat based on their yelp reviews and was impressed by how many awards they've won.  Our meeting with them was the best one as they are warm and professional.  They don't pressure you into any services (they tell you that you can decide at any time).  They even invited us over for dinner for us to get to know one another.  I would recommend an engagement shoot if you can afford it, as it makes you more comfortable on the day of (I felt a little awkward during the engagement shoot, but by the time the wedding day rolled around we felt at ease, and I feel the pictures show that).

Quality: My friends who I shared our photos with raved about how good they were.  Mike and Nat have a synergy that allows them to capture a full complement of beautiful formal and candid photos.  What sets them apart is how innovative they are with the types of photos, backgrounds, poses, etc. and how well they capture light (I can definitely see how they won all of those awards!).  We would definitely use them again for any family photos, events, etc.</text>

<Review>We hired Mike to photograph our weekday City Hall wedding and I couldn't be happier with this decision!  The photos turned out beautifully across the board.  Mike captured moments where we look happy and connected.  He captured moments where our guests look emotional and very much themselves.  He caught photos of old friends and new relatives who were just meeting in ways that felt fresh and natural.

He also rolled with the punches when our schedule was completely altered by issues with another vendor for which I can't praise him enough.

Finally, as a bride and a woman I often feel self-critical and don't much like photos of myself.  But in Mike's photos I feel the joy of the day and as joyful people are beautiful, I look beautiful.  His style and his photography made me feel more confident than I do on any other day.  And that?  That is a reason to hire Choco Studios for your wedding.<//Review>< Time>

Our photographer Mike had a lot of City Hall experience, so knew the best spots for the best background, lighting, etc. He also worked very efficiently so we got a lot of both official and candid pictures.
There are other crucial factors to consider when choosing a photographer, and Mike really stood out in those areas as well.
First of all, the contract was really straightforward, and it was very easy to discuss questions with him. I have seen some weird conditions with other photographers, or they got oddly defensive if you asked any questions. Mike is also very responsive to emails, both before and after the wedding, and our pictures were delivered very quickly. He is really friendly, super experienced, and put everyone at ease. This made both us and our guests feel more relaxed, which was really important the day of the wedding and for the pictures themselves.
We'd highly recommend Choco Studio for wedding photography!</review>< pictures>

I can not imagine a better experience than we had with Mike and Nat.

We were really grateful that they encourage couples to have an engagement photo session with them. We were pretty awkward at the beginning of our session, but over the course of two hours relaxed and learned how to act more naturally in front of the cameras. We ended up with beautiful engagement photos and felt much more comfortable during our wedding photos. The wedding photos captured the moments that were the most special to us, and were naturally beautiful!

It'd be a joy to work with them again and I'd very much recommend Mike and Nat to anyone looking for skilled photographers.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Mike and Nat were a pleasure to work with for our October 2014 Fall wedding at the Fairmont in SF. From the first meeting, through the execution on the day of, working with them was a breeze. My family was crazy and demanding on the day of and they were able to deal with them professionally without me ever having to say a word or bat a lash, as the bride. Most of all, I really love their workmanship and product. Their style is a true romantic and natural portrait of your special event. They strive to capture your special day by encapsulating the candid facial movements/expressions, the aura, the background, and the overall feel one photo at a time. If you are looking for a posed picture type of job then they may not be for you (although we requested posed portraits for a small portion of the event only), but the majority of the photos caught all the fleeting moments, feelings, touches, and love that I couldn't have possibly saved in my memory or even remembered on that day.  I had my photos fairly quickly after the wedding which was awesome! I even got a couple sneak peak photos on my honeymoon!

I have been recommending them to everyone for years and will continue to do so. I look forward to working with them again and again to capture more happy events to come.

Mike is great! He is very nice in person and easy to work with. We met once in his studio before the wedding, and we left very impressed by his genuine, down-to-earth personality, knowing that we had made the right choice in him. (And what a lovely studio!) On the wedding day, Mike was prompt, professional, and the photos were superb! He has great vision and an amazing way to work with light. The shooting process was less awkward than we expected as well, because for the most part Mike remained "invisible" and took many beautiful candid shots. His suggestions for portraits were also very useful and made us look good and natural. Clearly he knew City Hall very well, and that really helped in getting more shots out of the time! The delivery of edited photos was fast, the quality incredible. Overall, I would highly, highly recommend Mike and Chocostudio to any happy couple looking to record their big day!< /Review>

I became a huge fan after seeing the beautiful pictures they shot for my friend's wedding and have been following them ever since.

When we began making wedding plans it was an easy choice who we wanted for our photographers. We had reviewed others but composition, and style there was no comparison.

Its been over a year since our wedding and I still get teary eyed when I see the pictures. You can't go wrong with Mike and Nat!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We LOVE our wedding photos. We wanted a San Francisco City Hall wedding photographer who is very experienced with this venue.

Our wedding was on the 4th-floor balcony at San Francisco City Hall. After the ceremony, we spent some time driving around San Francisco for additional wedding photos. It was a pleasure to work with Mike and the photos he delivered are amazing. Great experience and highly recommended.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808f9e750af95d15:0x471c75b083ed3f3d</GmapID></record>

Mike and Nat are truly amazing. They really captured our day in the most beautiful way possible. Every shot was more amazing than the next. They caught every special moment! They are beyond amazing to work with. Easy, professional, and fun!! Nat kept on reminding me to breathe all day and it sure did help. Mike is laid back and really really great to work with. During the wedding we didn't even notice them taking pictures...they were like photo ninjas!! Would recommend them in a heart beat!<//text>

Mike is absolutely AMAZING!!  I stumbled upon their site on yelp and fell in love with their pictures. Read up on all the stellar reviews, went through their blog and what I really love about them is how they really capture the beautiful, detailed, vivid moments in their photography and that is exactly what Mike captured on our wedding day.  When I go through the pictures, it is like reliving the entire day all over again and more!  He is not only an incredible photographer, he is professional, thoughtful, well organized, very thorough and puts a lot of thought and care into making everything go as smoothly as possible on your big day!    Thank you Choco Studio for helping to make our special day even more perfect and memorable than it already was!  We  HIGHLY recommend them and hope to work with them again for future family photos!  Thanks Mike and Nat!  :-)<//Text>

<text>When I was searching for a San Francisco wedding photographer I was honestly overwhelmed with the choices. Bay Area is full of amazing photographers and I wanted to make sure to really do my research and choose the best team for the job.

I love that Mike and Nat are a married couple and they photograph big weddings together as a team. Our day was hectic and it felt like I couldn't catch my breath because of the nonstop events. Mike and Nat were the calm in the storm and the time we spent for our wedding portraits actually helped me to relax and be more in the moment.

We'll always be grateful to Choco Studio for their artistry and effortless process. We got our photos back just a few weeks after the wedding and our family and friends are still talking about them. Do yourself a favor and check them out for your event.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Me and my fiance had initially planned to not get a photographer for our legal wedding at SF city hall, but changed our mind last minute, and reached out to Mike. He, luckily, was available for the day and we couldn't be happier with our choice. He was fun to talk to, made us feel very comfortable and the poses he made us do weren't anything that made us feel awkward. Instead, he gave suggestions on what might photograph well but mostly asked us to be ourselves and have fun, and took pictures around that. It was clear he had a lot of experience at the city hall as he knew all the right spots with good lighting. He was super flexible to work with and was more than happy to accommodate any photo requests we had. He post processed the photos pretty quickly and returned the final pictures before the scheduled date, and they were absolutely gorgeous. We'd tried a different photographer for an engagement event we had, and Mike's photos blew his out of the water. Highly recommended.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Mike was extremely professional and knew the City Hall very well. He had great ideas for photos and created fun out of the ordinary photoshots. He made sure that we get something different from the usual, boring wedding shots. He made us feel that he really enjoyed what he was doing and made sure we had fun too. Recommended!<//review>

We picked Choco Studio because of all the great reviews. There were cheaper options available but we wanted the best. Well... We ended up with something far from the best. Many family and bridal party photographs were messed up--people looking away, standing too far from everyone else, etc. I would think a good photographer would tell people where to stand, etc. Instead, they were just shooting what was in front of them without really paying any attention. Moreover, during the wedding reception, we constantly had to ask the photographers to take pictures because we would just see them just standing there and do nothing. The worst part of it all is that we don't have a single portrait of me and my husband, just a simple photograph of just the two of us that every couple would want to have. When we received the pictures, I couldn't believe we didn't have one. My mother-in-law even suggested we dress up again and just go to a different studio to redo our wedding photo shot. I know it sounds ridiculous, but that's how upset everyone in my family is. Now, when people ask me if I know a good wedding photographer to hire, I tell them I don't, but I do know who I wouldn't hire.<//text>< Pics>

This is a truly unique and amazing photographer in Bay Area! They have a talent and an eye for capturing special moments. During a wedding they somehow make themselves invisible and capture the magic of the day "from the shadows", rather than telling people how to stand and what to do. Just look through their portfolio and you will see what I mean. They've photographed weddings of many of my friends over the years and all the couples could not be happier! See for yourself...< /text>

<review>I wish I could give Choco more stars, but Google rules says 5 is the limit.

I happened to find Choco while browsing Google images from weddings taken at the same place I was getting married and Choco had shot a wedding there, thus they came up in the search. I looked at their work and loved it. I wanted the photo-journalistic style of photos and they had exactly what I needed. My husband and I met with them once and immediately booked them.

We didn't do an engagement session. We were traveling a lot and just decided we'd do a "trash the dress" session after the wedding. Our photos from the wedding were AMAZING. I am so happy that we went with Choco. I think the photographers are one of the most important parts of a wedding. 50 years from now, that's what you will have, your wedding photos. And I am so incredibly happy I booked Choco.

We did some posed pictures before the ceremony. But the weather was so cold and chaotic that I am happy I went with Choco for their "capture the moment" style. I didn't notice them all night, which is HUGE for me. I didn't want to be talking to someone and stop to pose for a picture. And I didn't want every picture to look the same with me and my husband posing or me and guests posing and smiling with that same smile everyone has specifically reserved for photos. Instead they captured moments and I am so happy they did.

One of the most touching photos they captured is one of my grandmother, sitting and watching our first dance. She has been around since the day I was born and raised me with my mother. She was so sick leading up to the wedding and made it because was determined to see me get married and see the first dance between me and my husband. But you see in her face how incredibly happy she is in that moment. I don't think that moment could have been captured if they made everyone pose for pictures. I can see in her eyes how happy she is to be there. And that photo is now, more than ever, so precious to me as she passed away three weeks after the wedding.

I highly recommend going with Choco for your wedding. Mike and Nat are very sweet and personable. They're easy to talk to and we were comfortable with them from the start. And I promise you, when you look at your wedding photos, you'll have a ton of friends who took posed pictures, but Mike and Nat's photos are what preserve the memories and moments of the night.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>We hired Mike for our pre-wedding portraits and ceremony in San Francisco City Hall. It turns out to be our best decision throughout our wedding preparation to invite him to record one of the most important moments in our lives for both my wife and me. We really love the Journaling Photography he presented that captures the moments who we truly were and what we really felt. We believe the meaning of having the wedding photos is not making a bunch of beautiful images of several pretty persons in formal dresses but rather, persisting how we feel and look like at those happiest days, so that maybe 5 or 10 or 20 years later when we look at those pictures the memory can be brought back by them to feel the same.

And that is what Mike's work can achieve. All the relatives and friends and both my wife and I look natural and happy in his pictures. He knows very deeply where can be the best spots and how to cheer us up in front of his lens. All those have seen our pictures are full of praise.

Also, Mike is really a nice person to get along with. By working with him we felt relaxed and comfortable when he took pictures of us. That as well helped to make such great pictures.

Definitely recommend Mike if you are seeking a photographer for your big day!< /review><UserId.>117367998141119159792<//UserId.><Rate>5< /Rate>< Date>

<Text>Our family is so grateful to Mike and Nat for their fantastic work. We used other photographers before and here is what we didn't like: being unrecognizably altered by editing software (like, no, don't remove my wrinkles, they are part of my face!!), being overwhelmed by a ton of props and decoration elements, being forced into unnatural poses. But not by these guys. They follow YOU when they try to capture how you live and act in the moment. They have the skills and the talents to make everyone shine in their natural beauty and in any setting, without unnecessary props. They make sessions fun and relaxing even if it's freezing outside :) They are genuine, dedicated to their work and very professional in delivering what's expected.
We hope we continue our annual sessions tradition, and hope we get our most precious moments captured through their lenses many many times!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>This review is long over due but Nat and Mike are not only wonderful to work with but work very well with each other! My husband and I knew from the beginning we wanted them to photograph our Big Day. They were very easy to talk to and work with. From our very first contact, they were very responsive to any questions we had and are very considerate and attentive. What I really love about Nat and Mike is their contribution to making our Big day stress-free. They would send us tips and reminders before the engagement shoot and/or wedding day before I could even stress about it.

We ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE our wedding photos and could not have asked for anything more. Nat and Mike! You guys are amazing. Thank you for everything! Brides to be, if you are looking for professional photographers who will capture your day beautifully, you will not regret choosing Choco Studiio <3!< /Review>< Pictures>

My family met Mike and Natasha in the Sierras while camping. They are a wonderful couple who translate their wonderful personalities into their work. We did our engagement photo shoot with them in early January 2018 and could not be happier. Our rambunctious  beagle puppy Albus, and my parents were there, and Mike was an absolute master at capturing the moments. Having kids and a dog himself, he knew exactly how to deal with little Albus and how to breathe life into our photos. We chose the Legion of Honor as our location on, a very busy Saturday, and Mike expertly worked with the setting to create the most beautiful photos. We are so happy and highly recommend Choco Studio to anyone!< /Review>

Mike was fantastic from beginning to end during our wedding ceremony at SF City Hall. On top of that, he took amazing images/photos with the City Hall architecture as an amazing backdrop. I can only say great things about Choco Studio and highly recommend their professional services.

Let me start off by saying that I have seen and reviewed THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of international wedding photos thanks to my previous job at a photobook company. If you have good looking people in nice clothes, a beautiful backdrop, and high quality camera with autofocus, it is not that difficult to take pretty photos. After being exposed to the same pretty yet ordinary wedding photos for years, I knew I wanted photographers with a different approach and style- photographers who knew how to steal moments of explosive emotions or thoughts besides "I hope I don't look fat."

There are SO MANY photographers in the bay area. I started by looking at portfolios and moving on to blogs, social media, and anything I could find on them (It is so important to look beyond their portfolios- that only displays their select very best work!!). After narrowing my options down, I finally stumbled upon Choco Studios on yelp. While their portfolio is amazing, it was their blog and photos I found on google that reeled me in. They met all my criteria- 1) Unique approach & style 2) Experience with taking equally beautiful photos in natural light + artificial light 3) Experience in capturing diverse/multiethnic weddings (We had a Mexican/Indian wedding) 4) Affordable price. I quickly made an appointment and booked Mike and Nat on the spot.

Mike and Nat go far beyond taking "pretty photos". Indeed, what they can capture in raw photos is exceptional, but it is also their skills in photo editing software that contribute to their unique style. I truly believe that photography is what they were meant for; they have an intuitive nature of knowing the exact moment of when to take photos- when you are looking at the photos later, it truly is like reliving your special day. And their abilities go beyond capturing the bride & groom wonderfully- we have the most amazing photos of guests as well!

Lastly, on our wedding day, we had a few things go wrong with other vendors, but we were able to count on Mike and Nat to be professional and do an amazing job smoothly, despite messy situations. I cannot recommend Mike and Nat enough!<//review>

This place feels like home to me.  Pastor Andrew, to me, has a spiritual connection to our Father,  Andrew talks About Loving each other, and raising each other up with love and support  With great teaching of the Bible.  When one sermons end, I try to bringing these words into my life and live by them, Thank you Pastor Andrew.< /review>

I love the Bridge-- but no church is perfect!.  It's full of flawed people who come because they are aware of their need to become more like Jesus, and who are willing to approach others in a spirit of grace.  The Bridge is very welcoming and interested in helping you get "plugged in."  There are plenty of places to serve and to use your gifts for the increase of the kingdom.  This church is big enough that you can "hide" if that is what you need, but the environment is really tuned to encourage your growth and flourishing as you become all that you are meant to be in Jesus.</Text>

The church itself is beautiful however the pastor isn't the most welcoming person. And it's not fun on Sunday's to drive in my neighborhood because all of their parishioners park up and down our streets. And they drive like speed demons down the street after they get out of services. Not the most considerate  congregation.</Text>

<review>This is far more than a building full of people... it's an amazing community. I have grown up in so many ways being a part of this faith community. The teaching is Bible-based and bold... even when it's not popular opinion. Though it's a large church, there are many avenues for getting involved and connected on deep and personal levels... life groups, sunday schools, service opportunities. The children's program has been updated and is amazing! The Bridge also has a heart for its neighborhood, city, and world... supporting local ministries, outreaches around the neighborhood, and sending missionaries around the world. I could go on and on... No one there is perfect. Everyone is welcome just as they are. This church acknowledges that we all make mistakes and offers hope and help for those hoping to live rightly.<//review>< userid>

its good just waiting for the new pastor I been going there for 14 years and over the years the church has helped me and I also pay tithes  a few days ago I was in a jam rent was due basically my bills were due.my thoughts were going crazy as I was driving the holy spirit said go to the church, that was the last thing on my mind, so I go fill out the paper work only to get a call the next day and said that I was ban for life in getting help from the church yet I'm an usher and a member and still pay tithes. that day before I was hurting bad and i waited to talk to the executive pastor  cause I felt hurt I waited an hour and thirty minutes and he was aware that I was waiting hoping to talk, then I even tried to get an appointment to know prevail, so I left, he didn't know if I was going to commit suicide or what he never reach out to me I love the bridge and I love the word of God</text>

I have been to several churches and found that the Bridge has been the most impactful, motivational, and inspirational. The message is always centered on Jesus and Pastor Andrew is very intouch with todays struggles. I hope if you are seeking a church, you will try the Bridge at least once. Peace, love, and Praise Jesus!</review><UserId.>117102255560220502229</UserId.><Time>1499013878149</Time></record>

The Bridge is 99.9% connected to Jesus Christ.
The leadership is committed to culture without compromising the message.
The truth and grace of scripture is highly honored and applied to real life situations.
The ministries are a modern model of impacting the world with the power of the gospel.</Review>

Loving enthusiastic folks who make you feel welcome.  The music was said to be diverse, but it's really just different volumes of the same music, not to say that is bad, just not as diverse as one is lead to believe.  I will return!< /review>

<Review>The actual service was great--the team was on time and worked efficiently. They listened to our concerns and were generous in their assessment of cost. The work was completed to our satisfaction. I would not say that about the business model of Stanley Steamer. It is impossible to work directly with the local franchisee. Everything goes through central offices in Ohio and Arizona, maybe elsewhere. I was not allowed to contact the franchisee to be sure everything was in order and that my request had not been lost along the way. I felt that I was getting a "pig in a poke," although in the end the service was fine. Why does Stanley Steamer hide the local franchisee from the customer?< /Review>< pictures>

This experience was not great. One of the guys was OK. He did much of the work and had his mask on the entire time. The other guy was a bit of train wreck - he asked if he could use our bathroom which was fine but was in there for 10 minutes. He was inside the house without his mask pulled up so I asked him to pull it up and he did but every other time didn't have it pulled up which means he didn't have his mask on 95% of the time he was here. My wife and I had masks on the entire time.<//Review>

The technicians, Solomon and Danny, were right on time and so cheerfully polite!  The job was a bit complicated because it was on the top floor of a downtown condominium.  They organized their portable equipment efficiently and we got it in the elevator and up to the unit "lickety split". I recommend Danny and Solomon highly.</review>

We have four cats that we share life with and the carpeting really has to work hard around our house.  I can easily recommend Stanley Steemer without reservation.  Thanks guys!< /Review>< Pics>

Both technicians did a great job. You could tell they wanted to do a great job. Bailey, who did our couches, was so pleased at how nice the couches came out. And was happy that I was pleased , as well. Bart was the same way with the carpets. You can send those two back any time.< /review>

<review>The team at Stanley was super efficient, on-time, did a great job and were super friendly with our puppy.  We loved the experience. Also, the use of technology to let us know the status of the team, confirming the booking and updates, was amazing!  The pricing was a little bit on the higher side but well worth it. Our carpet and rug look new!< /review><Response>None< /Response><user>110598258985949532113< /user>< Date>

Everyone from the office staff (Renee and Cody) to Javaren who came to clean my carpets was just so very nice. Javaren came way within the 4 hour window of 2-6pm. He was here at around 2:30. Explained everything and went right to work. At the end,  left the carpet soooooo clean and smelled great. Gave me advice on spot cleaning, which I appreciated so very much. Thank you to all involved in getting my dirty, pet stained carpet cleaned!!</text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>I've been getting the service from Stanley and it has been remarkable so far. But this time with the upholstery and tile cleaning, I'm very disappointed. First of all the guys weren't professionals at all. They had the boot cover on, but they kept going to the van parked outside and coming back inside the home with the the same boot cover, they didn't bother to take it off when they stepped out. They cleaned the tiles, but they spoiled the rest of the floor area of the house. Also, they kept walking on the cleaned tile area while they were cleaning the rest of the tile flooring and they carried the detergent with their boot cover all over the house. Even after cleaning, there were places they didn't do well and when pointed out, the guy said that's all they can do. It was so messed up and i really prayed for the guys to leave, such a horrible experience this time.</Text><user_id>115835122877549001480</user_id>< Resp>

They arrived early and got the job done quickly. My husband and I were able to work from home while they cleaned the carpets in two other rooms. They did a great job cleaning and only summer high traffic areas still show wear,. I would recommend using Stanley Cleaners.<//review>

<text>Bart did a very good job in cleaning our carpets.  However, no-one phoned us to tell us that he was on his way as we expected.  We were given a 2 hour time frame and expected someone to call us so we were surprised when he rang the door bell.  Also, we needed to ask him if he would be using his shoe coverings and gloves because he did not explain that to us when he came in.  He wore his mask, but during the visit he had it below his nose while still covering his mouth - the CDC says that's not a good thing to do.  We are satisfied with the carpet cleaning.<//text>< Pics>

I hired them to clean one carpeted room in a house. I was quoted and paid 165 dollars for the cleaning/deoderizing the room. The technician who came was polite and wore a mask and completed the cleaning/deoderizing of the room in under 45 minutes. I was left with instructions to wait until this morning to enter the room so it could dry. Upon entering the room I immediately noticed that the edges/corners of the room had not been cleaned as well as the fact that NO deodorizing had been done. The carpet hardly looks cleaner. I will not be using Stanley's again.</review>

Stanley Steemer sent to representatives who were very professional and cordial and had great conversation.  And some of my heaviest traffic areas the gentleman spent so much time cleaning them and going over it and over it and over it to make sure everything was clean.  I highly recommend Stanley Steemer I had a great experience.< /Text>

Very happy with the quality of work and they called me as a van had became available early, and they wanted to know if I was available early or to wait. This was super convenient for me and so I agreed. I was having a second floor apartment carpets cleaned and the guys knew exactly the best place to set up and the did a perfect job in only a little over an hour. Super courteous and friendly. Definitely happy and will use this company again.<//Text>

Crew did a fairly good job, except he didn't clean an area in the family room near the reclining chair with dirt stains on the carpet,  and which I couldn't see until after he left our home. Perhaps he couldn't see since the light was too bright?  Please send him back to clean that area.</review>

Great quality at a great price. I had never had a service like Stanley Steamer come to my house and clean rugs or floor tile. They came out and were right on time. They surveyed the area to be cleaned and recalculated the cost and saved me money, first thing!
Once they got started they showed me the difference between what my tile looked like and what it now looked like after they cleaned it and what a difference. Couldn't have ever guessed it would be so dramatic.
The two people that came out were very efficient, quick and very polite.
I am going to call them to clean two rugs we were going to throw out, but I'm confident Stanley Steamer will save them.
Great Job!< /Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>My technicians were very professional and courteous! They were very quick and efficient with the service. The only thing that I didn’t like was that my carpet was supposedly a “deep clean” and for $185 in a 2 bedroom apartment I expected to not see any dirt in the carpet but unfortunately I did. It didn’t exceed my expectations as far as the outcome of the carpet, but the technicians were very nice and did their job.<//review>< Pics>

They were prompt, efficient, professional and truly cared about not leaving unless I was completely satisfied - which, I was! They both did a great job on the carpets and sofa!

Thank you Stanley Steemer leadership for investing in & training your people to do the most vital and basic thing....to care about people! The job quality is extremely important of course, however, we need to focus on caring about people first! Some companies (large and small), don't get that simple, basic fundamental and necessity to grow and sustain your company!

I have used your company for many
years for various properties, both personal and professional and will happily continue to recommend you to family, friends and colleagues!

Great job again, Lance and Jason!<//text><userid>103957638051882681337< /userid><rating>5<//rating>< resp>

Steemer associates were professional, attentive and explained in detail their approach to cleaning our dog soiled carpet, and then they cleaned and sanitized it. They also advised on how to handle this problem should it reoccur.

Our couch was very stained, and it could not be cleaned 100%. However, the workers advised us that this would be the case before they started. We asked them to go ahead and do the best they could. They put a lot of effort in to get the best results possible.<//Review>

I was really excited about using Stanley Steamer.  The sectional looks good and clean, although I see a few dog hairs that they may have missed.  I think our marble tile was scratched by their equipment in a couple of places, too.  The grout looks cleaner, but not as clean as I expected.  The price was insanely expensive for what I got.  I probably won't use them again.</Text>

I am so very satisfied. I had them clean everything---carpets, sofa, sectional and chairs. Everything came out so clean! They were very professional, and yet friendly. They finished in a timely manner. This was the second time  Damien did the cleaning, and I would call Stanley Steemer again, and ask for Damien and his partner.<//Text>

Fast and efficient crew who helped me move a couple of things as well.  The carpet was actually blue and not brown afterwards.   The only problem was the terrible odor we had in the house for 2 or 3 days.  I opened the winddws and put in a few fans and used lots of Fabrise.< /review>

The gentleman (I didn't get his name) who came out, did a great job. He got to my place and got down to work. He was done in a timely manner. My place looks great. I didn't give the 5 stars, because they are pricey. Yes, I recommend them!< /text>

They arrived on time and transformed my nasty looking carpet into a fresh clean carpet. They sprayed some “magic” cleaner on the spots and wow the spots disappeared. They also were very quick too. Overall I love my carpets now and Stanley Steemer</text>

Easy to schedule by phone.  I did this because I wasn't sure how to count some of my spaces...like a landing between rooms..is that a room or a hall?  The appointment was for 8:00, I thought...but it was actually an arrival between 8 and 9:00.  They arrived at 8:30.  David introduced himself and asked to see the rooms so we did a walk around and I asked some questions and pointed out some issues of concern.  His partner, a woman started to get the equipment together.  After the walk-through I added 2 spaces; a room and a walk-in closet.  Then they began their work.  All this was good, and the result was pretty good as I have old carpet and some stains have been there a very long time.  The only negative comments are: 1) they didn't do a walk-around after the cleaning as they have in the past.  Consequently I found several stains that I would have asked them to work on more before leaving.  2)  There was standing water on hardwood floors around the 2 area rugs cleaned.  I had to ask the woman helper to mop that up...rookie mistake...and she spent most of her time on her phone in a very loud voice...kind of annoying and very unprofessional.  If she had an important call to make I would assume she would go outside and talk in private.  3) In the past I have felt like the team went out of their way to really inspect everything before and after and make suggestions...not this team.  They just arrived, did the cleaning and left.  They probably could have sold me some upgrades, but they didn't even try.<//text>

<Time>1567787021994< /Time><text>On September 3rd I had my carpets shampooed, and I was so pleased with how the company’s tech David and helper worked together on one accord.
They did a professional job. David did a wonderful, thorough job in shampooing; my carpet was overly dirty; he removed stains I didn’t think he would be able to get out, yet he did. He was very focused on what he was doing and that’s what I appreciated him for; as though he enjoyed what he was hired to do.
His helper worked in unison, making sure pieces of furniture was move in areas needed to be moved and spraying the protective spray afterwards, placing each furniture back in its place. And their attitude was pleasant.
I would gladly refer them whenever asked.
Thank you again Stanley Steemer.
Great job!< /text><GmapID>0x808f8fe12f005939:0xd6bc5d9bbe28990b<//GmapID>< user_id>

Joe  Bayluy cleaned our light gray wall to wall carpets today.  He did a great job and we are so happy with the results. Joe was very thorough and a pleasure to have in our home.  He also told us about Stanley Steemer services to clean the Persian rug and upholstered furniture.  Who knew!  Joe is so careful and knowledgeable that we would have him back to doe that work as well. Highest recommendation for Joe and Stanley Steemer!< /review>

the job was done in no time as he had an assistant, he was also able to move some of the heavier pieces to clean under.  He was so nice and took excellent care of my crazy house.  I hope to continue to get him when I call.  Could you email his name so I can ask for him in the future?</text>

<Review>We've used Stanley Steemer over the years and have never been disappointed.  They are friendly, courteous and very professional . Our carpets always look great. One of the workers also gave us a tip on how to keep our puppies urine from staining our carpets. It worked!  We've normally just have  our carpets and furniture cleaned but recently had them do our hardwood floors too.  They turned out beautiful, we're  very happy with the outcome. Highly recommend Stanley Steemer.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>The assistant was new to the job and needed constant instruction from the lead person. Things were not replaced as they were originally; he did not pre-spray for the leader as I've seen other assistants do; he left our front yard hose unconnected. In short, he needs more training. I don't blame him. I blame Stanley Steemer.<//Review>< userid>

<Text>Excellent experience with Stanley Steamers. I’ve had some horrible experiences with carpet technicians in the past but Stanley was professional and cleaned my carpets better than the past technicians. Very satisfied customer, it’s rare in the Bay Area to have someone take pride and actually do the job your paying them to do. 👍🏾</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Our carpets were in terrible shape.  I know they need to be replaced - but I chose to redo the kitchen this year so they would have to wait.  Somehow Stanley Steemer always seems to make them look so much better. They always do a fantastic job.  They are the only company I call.< /Text><Name>Lisa Nelson< /Name><Date>1562859314888</Date>< userid>

I’m reviewing the job that was done today, 2/7/20.my carpet is still wet and I see 2 stains on my carpet. Ordinarily Damion comes and points out stains he sees, and tells me what he’s going to do to remove them. None of that this time, and the stains aren’t gone.
I’d like Stanley Steemer to come back out to work on those stains please.</text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>The cleaning itself was fine; good job.  The only trouble came from their not telephoning me just before they arrived; or if they did phone they didn't reach me nor leave a message.  Hence, they just showed up, and my 2 cats freaked out.  I would have enclosed them if I'd known the technicians were on their way.  I wound up getting scratched by my cats and the whole appointment started off on the wrong foot.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<user_id>102287909542850414573</user_id><text>DJ was the 1st technician that came to clean our carpet.  He did a good job cleaning most of the carpet in the different rooms. However, he left out the carpet area under the furniture. Thank goodness Stanley steemer provided a follow up visit.

Bartholomew was the 2nd technician that came over to do the follow up and he did a much better service. I  highly recommend their services and will definitely contact them for the next carpet cleaning.< /text><rating>4<//rating><Gmap_id>0x808f8fe12f005939:0xd6bc5d9bbe28990b<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Damion and Jason from Stanley Steemer were on time, professional, and did a great job. My carpets have heavy stains from my two dogs. Damion and Jason were able to get the stains out. The carpets looked and smelled good when they were done. I am very happy with the job they did.<//text>

POOR!! I had my carpet cleaned yesterday and today NO how about last night there are visible spots untreated. The carpet also has a smell after the treatnent which we had to febreze and use scotch guard carpet cleaner. During the years we've use you all before and did not have this experience. We are not happy and will discontinue using Stanley Steamer. I can't which way your stars go but it was a very POOR Job!!</Review>

<text>I was very pleased with Stanley Steemer services. From speaking to the person making the appointment to the arrival of Myron (ON TIME!). My appointment was between 8-9 am and Myron arrived right at 8 am. He explained the process and also answered any additional questions I had. My carpet had groun!d in pathway dirt. I really didn't think all of it would come out. IT DID!  I felt a weight lifted off of me when I saw what a great job he had done. Thank You Myron of San Leandro Stanley Steemer<//text>< pics>

<Text>Larry (San Leandro Mgr),

My wife & I scheduled Stanley Steamer for a November 21, 2018 carpet cleaning in hopes of us ridding us of our pets stains, their odors and of the general foot traffic grime that had accumulated over the years.

We've had other companies & service technician's provide us with the same services we ordered from Stanley Steamer although, the end result never turned out as they'd promised us it would.

It wasn't until Stanley Steamer sent "Dorjuan" (DJ) to our home that we'd finally achieved the results we've always wanted. "DJ" was on-time, very professional, knowledgeable, friendly and he took the time to listen to our needs.

A customers first and final impression determine if that customer is a never customer or, a forever customer. "DJ" met and exceeded all our expectations above and beyond what we'd anticipated and we could not have been happier and as a result we are now a forever customer.

Thank you "DJ". We look forward to working with you again in the future.

Regards,
Kevin</Text>< GmapID>

<review>2nd time for Stanley Steamer to do carpet cleaning. This time only one person came to do the job. It's difficult for him to move the furnitures since he's alone. Broke my antique lamp.

<resp>None<//resp><Review>Haven't tried Peruvian food? Make this the spot to try. This little gem is hidden in the corner of its shopping center and may be missed driving by but it is not to be passed by without trying their cuisine.  I've tried more than half the items on their menu and now it's hard to make up my mind on what I want since it's all delicious!

All plates are worth trying especially any with their roasted chicken. Mouth watering and falls right off the bones!

Parking: plenty available
Prices: great
Service: excellent
Food: A review will not do it justice! Must try!
COVID SAFE: they are taking extra precautions from wearing masks, a sign up form for dining in, and providing hand sanitizer. Thank you.

You will not be dissatisfied!< /Review><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

I adore this restaurant! They provide superb food, they have a rich menu, The chief cook in that place is well trained, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The food is consistently of high qualtity, the service towards the customers  is good. I visit often this place and I not even once was unhappy. Highly recommended.<//text>

We came here to celebrate our friend's birthday and we had a great time.
Deanna or Diana was so friendly and informative.  Everything we ordered was scrumptious.   And even though the place was small,  it was clean and comfortable.   We all agreed we will definitely be back.< /Text>< pics>

<review>This restaurant serves their food so appetizing and the food is delicious. I took my girlfriend June 26, 2020 for lunch   She loved the food also. As soon as they are open for inside dining we will be bringing our friends and family for a yummy meal.

This place is phenomenal!  Stopped here on a whim after getting a haircut locally, and what a good decision that was!  The place is clean and the service outstanding.  Karina was such a great host, very attentive and nice.  Since this was my first time, went for the Lomo Saltado.  It didn't take long for the hot plate to come.  The flavors were all on point, just as perfect as it could be.  Very large portion but I finished it (mama would have been proud)
They have 2 sauces tableside: a jalapeño-based aioli and a huacatay sauce.  Both were incredibly flavorful, with the huacatay being spicier.  I wanted to take the bottles with me, but that would have been rude (but I would have been totally justified).
I'll definitely come back with the family and order everything else.  A must stop if you are in the area.</Review>

It was just okay. By far not the best Peruvian food around. Doesn't even offer the hot rolls for the green sauce like most Peruvian places. Staff is beyond nice, but again the taste is just okay. Wasn't happy with my rice either. It tasted like it was made with dirty river water or something :(< /Text>

<review>Food here is wonderful! I don't know what spices they use but this is the best place for roasted/rotisserie chicken! The fried rice is amazing as well and uses the same chicken.<//review>< Pictures>

I'm a big fan of Higo sushi (super nachos are amazing), so when they moved, I was happy to see that they kept the space and opened a chicken restaurant! They serve the normal Peruvian affair, my favorite being the tallarin Verde. The service is quick, never extremely busy, it's clean, and the staff is friendly. Take out is also available if you dont want to sit and eat there. Oh and the prices are great and I don't feel like a pig after eating as it's relatively healthy.< /review>

<Text>This is one of my faves for Peruvian food and I highly recommend them. It is located in a tiny shopping center with limited parking.  The place itself it smallish, but new and very modern.  The menu is small, but the food is SOOOOO GOOD.  The chicken is delish and so is the Aji de Gallina.  The traditional green hot sauce is REALLY GOOD, too.  They also have a nice selection of Peruvian drinks.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1574284947130, 'text': 'Thanks for coming Amie and for the review!'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Super good food.   Unusual spices.   Be aware of you order fries they may come drenched in their sauces,  which though good,  may not be what you want on fries.   Try the Peruvian punch,  it's interesting.<//Review>< resp>

(Translated by Google) They have a basic menu and it's good, but not spectacular. They have grilled chicken with a touch of sweetness and it already changes the whole idea of ​​the Peruvian recipe. However the taste good. The chicken aguadito with a touch of kion past, for those who like that recipe well. The huancaina didn't have much flavor. The chaufa rice was very tasty.

i really love going to this place. The workers really care about your experience there. they listen to what you want if you are not sure what to get and they are very patient with you while you contemplate what you want to get. i would recommend this place for sure. the food i choose to get here is always delicious.< /Review>

The food is fresh, the portions are generous, and the prices are cheap. The downside is that you can't eat inside, you can only order to-go. The tosticamaron tasted fresh, it could easily feed two people and its only $8.</text>

No complaints! The agua de horchata was really good my kids loved it! Mangonada was delicious just a little too much chamoy for me but still good and the tamarindo raspado was spot on!< /text>

Didn't like it. Fruit was hard, and when I ask for nachos I mean the regular tortilla chips with nacho cheese not the tostitos chips, or the chips they use for the tostilocos. Also they hardly put any cheese and when ask for a bit more they charge more when the first time they only put a tad bit.</Text>

Small intimate venue with expanded seating in a rear patio. Entertainment from the patio is viewed via flat screens.  Good food, must have a baked potato with choice of toppings,  and service with a smile.  Street parking on major boulevard.</Review>

<text>The Baked Potato is a jazz institution in LA!
As one of the city’s most frost formidable and long standing jazz bars, it host a variety of modern and veteran jazz and jazz/rock/fusion players from around the globe. The decor is full of authentic memorabilia dating back many decades with original signatures on most of the photographs. The sound is incredible and is well balanced through the entire club with attention to detail. There is no bad seat anywhere, great views from front left and right of the band. The staff is also amazing! The baked potatoes are huge and equally amazing!!</text>< date>

Man this place is hip. Straight ahead jazz on Sundays and often on Thursdays and Saturdays as well. Seating is a little pricey, but that's what you pay to see the heavy hitters!

Keep an eye on the calendar. Many of the greats show up. Book your tickets well in advance, just not before I do 😉< /text>

A long long time ago ,
The best girlfriend ever took me here for a date. I had a $25 baked potato . I couldn't finish it. It was good. And so was the atmosphere and the band. The band was so close they were IN my baked potato. It was so cool.< /Review>

I enjoyed myself immensely tonight! Keep the music going featuring Joe Bonamassa and all the musicians that he accompanied was awesome! They all played for two hours, special guest stars, you just don't get that anywhere else in such a venue as this. I recommend that you all set yourself up an account, look at some of the live streams that are available. Keep this place going! Don't let it close. Keep it alive. We all need our music, I have seen so many venues,  museums, even in Nashville,,,support our musicians!!!!</review>

This is one of LA's best secrets! If you like jazz, blues, or best of all fusion, there's no place like the baked potato! Baking at the Potato, as they say. An intimate venue, don't come if your claustrophobic. It's about the size of Grandma's living room. Everybody that plays here is a veritable legend. And they serve up a hundred varieties of baked potatoes. With a full bar and two drink minimum, it's downright cozy. This is the place for serious music fans.</Text>

It's a one-of-a-kind music venue that's cozy and charming. You get to be right next to the musicians as they play. The food and drink menu is great and the service is responsive and friendly. I highly recommend The Baked Potato, especially if you're into experimental or jazz fusion music.</text>

Great live Jazz bashing an intimate atmosphere. Unpretentious, cozy and hard to go wrong with a baked potato garnished your way. Only downside is temperature management. Frequently too cold. Otherwise highly recommend stopping by and discovering music in this gem of a joint.< /review>

<review>This is a fun little intimate place for some good jazz without pretentious energy. The whole idea of the Menu is “baked potatoes”.

⭐️ Menu is full of giant baked potatoes of any kind
⭐️ Live jazz shows
⭐️ Great staff

👎 Street parking<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Always a good time here. Love the potatoes. We saw Cosmosquad. 👌 However, the bartender needs to learn how to make more drinks. I had requested a special drink..... And it turned out horrible. But it's alright, they have quite a few other options. Oh, and bring ear plugs!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKcYiSiHAYf9xfS3hvF4zCh8eK6H4r5VfgRuYi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEBKcrqH4V6Cb6xfGwGlgfmmKsev0KSln58N_8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2be46c8139ab7:0x8900c6cfa93b252e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

5 stars because this place is Fantastic!  Mine you... I don't like jazz and I don't like potatoes.

The jazz is Fantastic, the potatoes are addicting and the atmosphere is beautiful!

I'm converted!  Give this place a go.  Great night of entertainment!</review>

You are there for the music that night so I won't rate that. You'll probably love the music you went to see. My problem with the baked potato is 1st you're treated like cattle and 2nd while many seats are fine many are not. I am disabled and was wearing my leg brace and they put me on a tall stool anyway, in spite of my complaining.</Review>

2 stars for the ambiance minus two stars for being so insanely overpriced. The entire time I was in Los Angeles I didn't spend as much money anywhere else as I did here. $15 each person to get in, then they require you to purchase two drinks, and it was $50 for 2 potatoes that you won't be able to keep down after you realize how much money you spent, on potatoes. They were good, but there was no way they were worth even 1/2 that price. I don't think there's any potatoes on this planet worth even 1/2 that.< /review>

<Review>Great potential being lost to an environment that is way too loud to be comfortable and quite overpriced. 15$ cover charge to come in and be told that there is a two drink minimum (+10 for 2x soda) bringing the minimum amount spent on a date night would be 50$ for admission and the requisite 4 of the cheapest drinks. Then the potato’s are 15-20$ each so add another 30-50 to the bill. For 100$ i can take my date to a number of other places in LA that wont damage my hearing and pick my picket while doing so. Shame. I was really looking forward to enjoying this place. We wont be returning unless there are some drastic corrections.</Review><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

<rating>5<//rating><review>If your musical tastes include Jazz-Fusion? THIS is LA's "church". This intimate, funky 60 seater is where the real players play. Don Randi, part of the original Wrecking Crew (If you're not familiar, Google it) opened the now world-famous club in 1970. Full bar and full menu of entree sized of-what else?-baked potatoes stuffed with all sorts of stuff. You gotta be a world-class musician, or have the potential to grace their tiny stage. With concert tickets through the roof,  this place is a deal.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Imagine watching your friends jam in a garage in high school. Now replace your friends with some of the best musicians in the world. That's what a show at the Baked Potato feels like. Last night someone was so close to the stage, his head was less than 12 inches from the bass players head stock. If I lived closer, I would visit pretty often. The friendly staff is an added bonus.<//Text>

<text>Great, small jazz club featuring top players.  If you are into being right in the middle of the action, there's really not a bad seat in the house, so it's a must-do for fans of seeing top-notch musicianship up close, an a very intimate setting.< /text><user>112103154574245699604</user>< name>

This is a classic LA jazz venue. Wonderful staff and really great food!  They do a million baked potatoes and the cook is a super nice guy. Also a solid harmonica player. Do yourself a favor and go see some music at the baked potato. Places like these don't last forever.< /text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Saw a great show here but this place is too small, too crowded and too expensive. Im sure they are trying to get as many people in that they can, but removing 1 bar stool and about 4 or 5 chairs would do wonders for their customers comfort and enjoyment.

Instead of being able to really direct my full attention to the musicians working hard in front of me, I had to prop myself into half a spot at the bar where the required meal was served and there was no room to eat it, which turned out to not be the worst thing (more on that below), I couldn't sit on the bar stool or I'd have blocked the aisle, the host tripped over my foot that had nowhere to go (sorry brother. )  Both of my legs fell asleep along with my backside, tried to stand but that blocked the way. Needed to stay by my food so moving was out and it's not like there was anywhere to go.

About the food, when they named this place the baked potato they must have signed a non-compete with any other foods as every entrée is served on a baked potato. I love baked potatoes, except this one, it's just not a good base for everything. I had the "special" chicken fajitas potato which was a dry unfortunate creation and I can't imagine chicken fajitas with butter which was suggested as a moistener. It's almost like they are afraid to put anything else on the menu for fear of learning what a bad idea the all potato theme is. Lack of food and physical discomfort due to poor thinking and greed resulted in an evening that I have no desire to repeat. It's a shame, I'm a native angeleno and I've heard about the baked potato since I was a youngster, the best I can say is checked that off the list. The barman was very attentive, the waitresses seemed to be on top of things, the host left us standing by the door to be seated and my saintly girlfriend ended up going to find him. To you V, I'm sorry I didn't enjoy the evening, you are a wonder and I love you.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< pictures>

Solid, small, venue. Like seeing a live act in your living room. Great if you find an artist you love. Decent food. Nice atmosphere. Like your basement from the 70's, only louder.<//text>

<Review>One of the best live music venues in all of California. It's quite small about 70ish seats, but because of it the musicians are right there jamming in front of you only a few feet away, it truly allows for such a unique experience and provides some of the best sounding live music I've had the chance to enjoy.

There is a 2 drink minimum per person, but 1 of the drinks can be substituted for dessert if they have any available, due to limited supply. If you're hungry they have these gargantuan potatoes each with an assortment of toppings as well as some different salads. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are very generous. The drinks are also very strong without being over priced which is always good, they also have a pretty decent selection of wines and beer along with the usual spirits for cocktails or whatever.

I can't reccomend this place enough, if you have the opportunity to see a show here don't pass it up you'll regret it believe me.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

How does this place only have 207 reviews?  This place is legendary.  I once saw Eddie Van Halen walk in and do a set.  Only in LA baby.  Get off the couch and head to the potato!</text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>A cozy venue with interesting jazz musicians. I saw Ethan Sultry group on May 23, 2017. A mix of jazz blues and flamenco. I usually have gone on Sundays when anyone is likely to drop in to jam. There is a 2 drink minimum (doesn't have to be alcoholic - herb tea was $5). Prices are reasonable. Their signature dish is a gigantic baked potato smothered in various combinations of toppings, e.g. ham and cheese, Philly steak and cheese.  In all the years I've been last night was the first time I ordered the dish. I wouldn't order it again because the potato had no flavor. All in all, an enjoyable time and nice way to spend an evening.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Great place to see and hear some Jazz. The stage is very close up and your table is just feet away from the players and at the same time you can enjoy a nice meal featuring a variety of Huge Baked Potatoes as well as a full bar. It's small but friendly and the sound system is great.  In the past 18 months I've made the drive there and back (600 miles) to see The Oblivion Express 4 times. Justin and his staff do a nice job to make you feel welcomed. I'll be back later this year for certain</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The club is great. But I went there a couple nights ago and the guitarist scheduled to play was not there because "he is somewhere in Switzerland" as they replied when I asked them . Well they had at least a month to change it on their website or on their Facebook page. I think it's not fair otherwise next time they'll ask me to pay, I'll say my money are somewhere in Switzerland</Review>

However, I pestered the band leader to the point where he finally allowed me to sit in on one song while making me feel most unwelcome. If you're looking for a jam night where the attitude is all about inclusion and opportunity for all, don't to to the BP.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>The performers here are always top notch! I highly recommend Isamu McGregor if you can catch his set, but really any time I've been it's been great music! The venue is pretty intimate and they offer a wide selection of drinks and baked potatoes.< /review>< pictures>

I went there for dinner and for a live concert. The place is cosy. It's not fine cuisine but its tasteful and you're not hungry when you get out.</text>

<Text>Amazing. I had a great experience there. The environment and staff made me feel like we were all part of a big family there it was real great. OHM played both sets and we got to talk to Chris Polland for a good while which was a dream come true. Potatos were HUGE desert was aslo a huge, great selection of potatos including vegetarian and vegan options (if youre into that kinda stuff) prices are not bad at all. the place is a bit small but for me that ads to the charm of the baked potato. When youre there make sure to thank cheff! I recomend highly, i cant stress it enough.  My only complaint is that the drinks are $5 but it isnt a problem whatsoever, its nit picky at that point but yes, amazing music, amazing food, amazing environment and amazing location. Thanks! Ill be there tomorrow to see OHM 10/3/18. Untill then!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Awsome every time, but it's a small place, so you're very close to the act. Baked potatoes are big , so show up hungry. Dress however you would like, no big purses, (serioulsy). Recommend going early, for parking if driving, (Uber it, otherwise) and seating. Depending on the bands playing, most are broken up into two shows. It's still standing since 1970, support it. Not many jazz places left in L.A if any.</text>< Pics>

This place was ok, the people were friendly and the beer was cold, but a cover charge plus a two drink minimum is a major over reach. Don't go there if all you want is a casual drink, it's not worth it.</Review>

This is that place where at any given night you'll find famous musicians jamimg with other famous musicians. Its the who's who of the music business hang out! It's dark small and intimate setting sets the stage "if you can call it a stage" thats literally two steps away from you in any direction! Im grateful that my Famous Uncle Pat Vegas of Redbone brought me here and shared some great stories of back when! The food is good and plentiful so come hungry if you plan on eating! This place is the greatest hip and cool little hole in wall you'll ever discover! If you want to impress your friends on how cool you are this is it!< /Review>< time>

I have been frequenting this place since I was old enough to drive: seeing the likes of Dave & Done Grusin, Lee Rittenour, Patrice Rushen, Abe Laboriel, & Larry Carloton.  it is one of THE best places to see this kind of music in the entire region.

There used to be so many of these clubs but now, so few.  But the Baked Potato was ALWAYS, a step apart.

The quality of the music is their goal not the glitz and comfort!   Justin's effort's, taking over from his dad, are consistent!.  This is the place to go see --  not hot top 10 folks -- but the truly skilled: the musician's musicians.

These are the people who hollywood studios turn to when they need to drop a piece of music in front of them with a movie screen playing before them and say, "Take it from the top -- we're doing this in one take."

An understated homey and warm place to be with friends.  One of the
BEST!  No pretense whatsoever!  You see what you get and you get what you see!<//review>

Music charges and drinks are affordable and easy to enter. Let's make online reservations in advance!

I'm very numb with the performers.

By the way, since I always go alone, the potato has never asked. Everyone is divided by two! Lol

<text>(Translated by Google) A small, ultra-confidential room in such a big city ... it's simply a pearl. The musicians are right next to you and it sends a lot of weight. It is clear that there are many regulars sign of the quality of the place. The food served be potato form can accompany this good time.

Une petite salle ultra confidentielle dans un si grande ville ... c’est tout simplement une perle. Les musiciens sont juste à côté de vous et ça envoie clairement du lourd.

<review>(Translated by Google) The stage and the audience seats are very close and the power is different. Still, the sound is well balanced and all the instruments are clearly audible and wonderful. It's PA's technical ability. I'm sorry I can't take a stage photo.

ステージと客席がとても近く迫力が違います。それでも音のバランスが良くすべての楽器がはっきりと聴こえて素晴らしいです。PAさんの技術力ですね。ステージ写真をとれないのが残念です。< /review>< Pics>

<name>wiso71</name><Text>(Translated by Google) For a European or German, such an experience is unique, I guess. There is certainly no jazz club like this anywhere in Germany in my immediate vicinity (but I'm also not a jazz connoisseur)
The place was amazing. Very small but "huge" show by the artists present. There were individual guitarists, drummers, singers, etc. from world-famous bands who performed there in their free time outside of touring. You immediately felt and heard what great professionalism is behind there.
I would and will definitely go to Baked Potato again on my next visit to Hollywood! You should have done it, even if you have never really or not at all been in contact with jazz / blues.
It's worth it 😉

(Original)
Für einen Europäer bzw. Deutschen ist so ein Erlebnis einmalig schätze ich. So einen Jazzclub gibt es mit Sicherheit nirgendwo in Deutschland in meiner näheren Umgebung ( bin aber auch kein Jazz-Kenner)
Der Laden war der Wahnsinn. Sehr klein aber "riesige" Show durch die anwesenden Künstler. Es waren einzelne Gitaristen, Drummer, Sänger etc. von Weltberühmten Bands anwesend, welche in ihrer freien Zeit außerhalb von Tournees dort auftreten. Man hat sofort gespürt und gehört, welch große Professionalität dort hinter steckt.
Ich würde und werde bei meinem nächsten Besuch in Hollywood definitv wieder zu Baked Potato gehen ! Sollte man mal gemacht haben, selbst wenn man mit Jazz/Blues noch nie wirklich oder garnicht in Kontakt war.
Es lohnt sich 😉</Text><userid>102224955346656238890</userid><time>1529308603100< /time>< pics>
