<Review>This is a wonderful veterinary office! The staff are all pleasant, knowledgeable, and helpful. They were able to work with me in regards to price while still ensuring that my cat received the best possible care. Nancy was kind, pleasant, and highly accommodating, and our veterinarian, Dr. Jessica Gallo, was absolutely wonderful. Her expertise was only rivaled by her kindness. I would 100% recommend this business to my friends and family, and will be taking my pets here for any other veterinary services in the future.</Review>< pictures>

My Dog Barney was in good hand. He went in looking like he was dying and would have if he didn't get the necessary fluids and care that Cottage gave him. He is jumping around like a puppy again a day after he came home.  What I liked most about the whole experience was how they were so open to my questions and emotions. They called me often with updates on his condition and let me in on all procedures as they went along. I wasn’t worried for long and I didn’t have to wait until they called me to pick him up to know who he was doing.  I felt like I made the right choice and trusted them to do what was needed in his condition. Thank you Cottage and to all your staff. I saw the operations your are running during this Pandemic full of impossibilities and you still made everyone feel like their precious pet mattered to you. I saw others worried about their pets and witnessed how quickly everyone handled the crowd of cars pulling up in which your methods of taking their pets for them to return later for pick up was done in the utmost care, order and without incident. Five stars Cottage Pet Hospital, you will be the first one I call from now on.
Sincerely,
Laura (and Barney) Legan</text>

Read the negative reviews. It will save your baby's life. This vet has lost his passion. He does not care for his patients. If he no longer cares he should just stop practicing. His staff is a reflection of him. Just like him, they don't care about your fur babies. Please find another vet that will treat you and your best friends with the dignity and respect you both deserve. My last few visits to this place have been a nightmare. He doesn't show his face to acknowledge his mistakes. He will send his staff that show no emotion towards your pain. Avoid this place at all costs, It is a matter of life and death. Show your fur babies you love them by taking to them somewhere that cares!<//Review>

I dropped my pet off in the morning and was told to call at 3. I did so and told them I would be heading over. When I got there I called again to let them know I was there and the person who answered asked for my name, etc. After waiting 40 minutes I called again and someone else answered, took my info again and said they would have them out soon. Then it took another 30 minutes. There was zero communication and each person I spoke to acted like they would have the pet right out. It was a complete waste of time because if I call at 3 why would it take until 5 to release them? Why didn't any staff mention that, for whatever reason, it would be quite a wait?
All interactions I had with the staff in the afternoon were terse, bordering on rude. I talked to at least 3 different people and their vibes felt like I was a total inconvenience that I wanted my pet back.
And to top this experience off they shorted us on the pet's pain medicine.
In my opinion, don't bother with this place they will literally waste your time.</review>

I took my cat Jeorgie in on Black Friday when almost no one else was available. My little brat had a fight with some other cat and came back with a huge bite mark on his hip.
The staff at Cottage  Pet Hospital were very helpful and the doctor laid out our options for us (use anti-biotics & wait OR do a surgery). She explained the pros and cons for each option  and gave us time to consider.
We chose go with the anti-biotics. The hospital called to check on Jeorgie  twice  and asked me questions in regards to his wound, to make sure the medication was working and its healing properly.

They also sent Jeorgie a card at the end of two weeks wishing him all the best.
So All in all an amazing place to take your pet. They really care about the animals that come into their clinic and are great at following up on your fur baby's health and recovery.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I love this place!! I brought my cat here with an upper respiratory infection and they were so thorough and so helpful. After diagnosing her with asthma, Dr. Gallo was (and continues to be) so patient with my hundreds of questions. We don’t have pet insurance so the x-rays were pricey, but the prescription medications we were given are relatively affordable. I can’t recommend this practice enough, they are excellent!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Our Furgirl was distraught and had fever. The Vet Tech Kayla, stayed with her, gave her water and swabbed her paws until ready for Vaxx.

On Friday 11/13 they gave my cat to a stranger, to a different client/pet owner than me and they did not even realize it until I asked where my cat was. Once again they gave my cat to the wrong person and that person drove away to their house with my cat.

I got there at 4PM after waiting outside for 2 hours I asked where my cat was since they had said they would bring him out about 30 mins prior. It took until 7:30PM for them to return my cat to me because they had sent one of their techs to go pick it up from someone else's house... They lied to me about 5 different times, around 6:30PM I started calling asking them what was going on, they first told me there was an emergency, then that they were really busy, etc.

I don't understand how they made such a huge mistake but the worse is that they tried to shove this under the rug, they told me the owner would call me the next day. This person never reached out, talked to their lead vet Dr. Sahai a week ago and never got a call back. It is disappointing to know that they don't care about their patients or their customers at all.< /review>

I think they charge too much and the assistants are very friendly and helpful. I didn't like the fact that it takes forever to get a doctor to call back with test results. I'm going to be taking my pet elsewhere for better service and pricing.</Text>

<review>All of the staff have been very kind and efficient from entering the office to the end of the visit.  They are very knowledgeable, and very aware of your own financial situation when this is an issue. They do not pressure you.  They have been reasonable in the fees for various visits for both our cat and dog.  Their hours are the most convenient I have seen.  I highly, let me say, HIGHLY recommend Cottage Pet Hospital for your pets health needs.<//review>< pics>

I've been coming here since I moved to SoCal and they've been very helpful and caring towards my dogs. Staff is always nice and gentle with my dogs and very helpful whenever I have questions. Since the 5 years I've been going to them they've had a number of different doctors which is the only draw back for me. Side note, the place looks great after their remodel.< /Review>

Stephanie was there for me when I had to say goodbye to two of my fur babies. I could tell she hurt as much as I did. I wouldn't take my pets anywhere else. Thank you all!</Review>

This has been an overdue review of our overall experience at The Cottage Pet Hospital.
Which has been a pleasant experience from the moment I picked up my phone to call and investigate pricings and booking an appointment. I was greeted by Liz , she took her time in answering all of my questions over the phone. She seemed calmed and pleasant and very informative.
My chihuahua had some type of paw allergies/rash. Being that we were first time customers they had to evaluate  her. It turned out to be  a common grass allergic reaction . She was given an injection that lasted a month and  since then it has cleared. She is due to  come back in soon, for the same reason. The cost of the consultation was reasonable.
Over all our experience was great. We arrrived and was finally able to meet Liz the girl I spoke with over the phone . And was  greeted  the same with the utmost respect and she was a pleasure. She took care of my Roxy!
The staff in general seemed very nice with the office having a general great atmosphere/ vibe!
I will be recommending this place to my friends and family . For all of their pet needs!<//review>

I am so glad to have found this place at such short notice. My little 16 year old senior Chihuahua fell ill over a weekend and they were there for me when I needed them the most. Unfortunately, I had to let my dog Rest In Peace for financial reasons, his age and the state he was in. This hospital had very reasonable costs for the blood work and X-rays and all the diagnosing tests. The euthanasia procedure is not something to ever look forward to, but the staff here and the Dr’s made it very calm and comfortable for my little baby dog. I will forever be grateful for the peace that you have given my little Cujo. Thank you all so much.< /Text>

Everyone there is very nice and take their time with your pets. My lab has always hated going to the vet and the folks at Cottage Pet Hospital have really helped him handle getting his shots/check-ups so much better than our last vet. They are also very up front about costs and check with you before any recommended procedure. I would definitely recommend Cottage Pet Hospital!<//review>

Doctor and staff are wonderful!   They took very good care of my Cat (Tang) while she had her spay procedure done.  And even made sure I had meds for her after care and explained how to continue to care for her.  They are wonderful people and provided excellent quality care! Plus they aren't too far of a drive. And they are reasonably priced.  I highly recommend them!< /Review>

<Review>Cottage Pet Hospital is a great place to take your pets. We took our cat there for 13 years. The service was always very polite and prompt, and Dr. Sahai saved our cat's life several times. Their equipment and procedures are state-of-the-art, and the veterinarians and staff are all very knowledgeable. They really care about the animals. When our old cat died, we adopted two rescue kittens who are now patients at Cottage Pet Hospital. Their veterinarian, Dr. Jimenez, is very knowledgeable and clearly enjoys the patients. Our cats respond very well to her gentle style. We are looking forward to many years with our kittens and with Cottage Pet Hospital.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Friendly staff who cares deeply for the wellbeing of your pet. Been coming here for about 4 years after trying to find a competent vet that didn't just dismiss my cat who was almost dying as a minor allergy. Cottage hospital quickly prescribed antibiotics and my cat went back to his healthy self in about a week. I wouldn't take my pets to any other clinic.< /review>

The office and clinical staff at college pet hospital or warm, welcoming and clearly capable.
For example: My dog Molly does not like to get on the scale for her weight. They are very patient with her while trying to get her on the scale and to standstill. After this she willingly accompanies them to the back.
The doctors are also wonderful. They are clinically very strong and have great bedside manners.
Their hours are very convenient and they make appointments as well as taking walk-ins. What more could you ask?< /Review>

I adopted a dog from this pet hospital and I was so moved by how well they treated this poor fellow. He had been left by his family who never returned and during that time, they took such good care of him. I was notified by a friend that maybe I would like to adopt him which I did. They were so careful in interviewing me to make sure I was going to be a good pet owner. I think they are really great people< /Review>

<review>My dog was hit by a car the Thursday before a holiday weekend (a tragic accident occurred and technically both my dogs were hit the same night but I won't go into detail in this review).   He was less than a year old and weighed 6lbs. The only vets open were ER vets.  He needed surgery immediately and the cost of surgery at the ER vet was astronomical.  Cottage Pet hospital went above and beyond to help me and my 8month old rescue, Bradley.  The assistant who answered the phone said she wanted to call the doctor (on his day off) to see what they could do.  Minutes later the doctor called and told me he wanted to help and was going to find a way to get the surgery done despite the fact that they would be closed in addition to several other hurdles that made the task seem impossible to me.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing and I wondered whether everything would work out as the dr explained.  It did.  Because the doctor cared more about my dogs life than profit, today I have a fully functional healthy 18month old.  I'm convinced that there is a special place in heaven for people this who value life and health and will do ALL they can to save it.  I can't thank cottage per hospital enough.  They are the kindest people I've met and have the best place to bring my pets.<//review>< pics>

<Review>We received excellent care from Dr. Sahai and Dr. Jimenez at the Cottage Pet Hospital for our Murphy and we were always warmly welcomed by staff. We appreciate how close the hospital is to our home and that they are opened 7 days a week. In addition to the wonderful care we received, we also used their boarding facilities which gave us peace of mind when traveling.< /Review>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><review>They took great care of my dog "SPECK" up until his death and even after death they didn't stop caring. I had my dog cremated and they did an amazing job with the ashes and a keepsake paw print, dog tag and a clipping of his hair.  It made it a little easier to have the keepsakes and to know that they don't stop caring just because your animal dies.

I highly recommend them to anyone with a pet.<//review><date>1431835522197<//date>< user>

The staff is great! The prices are affordable & they never try to upsell on things we don't need. They always make recommendations & work with us to make sure our fur babies are well taken care of. They even called to follow up on how my baby was doing after surgery. We have been taking our fur babies to Cottage for over 4 years. We have always received the best care and friendliest service. We love Cottage!<//text>

<Review>This place is a RIP off...my wife took our cat a while ago cuz he had diarrhea, and despite having an appointment, she waited abt an hour
before the dr come to examine our cat...they told my wife over the phone that the charge for the service, will be $45,but she end up pay little over $100😡,also they asked her for her ss#🤔🤨 very weird and suspicious since she was going to pay cash.

Today my wife called em to check abt mail trimming for our dog,she was told it cost $15,but when we went there,they told her that she had to pay an extra $45 to examine the dog,which was never mentioned over the phone when she called!!!

This place is a big RIP off!!
I don't recommend it to anyone!!<//Review>< user>

Dr's and staff are really welcoming. I went on the search for a new vet because I couldn't bear to walk in to the vet I had been going to because that's where we had to put down my cat of 15+ years with cancer. Just the thought of it made me break down into tears. I took my other  cat here on an emergency and was accommodated to the schedule and my cat and I left happy campers.  Prices were reasonable. I'm glad I found a new place for my furry ones.<//Review>

<review>We were traveling with, our 16 year old Yorkie girl, Pepper when she let us know it was her time to go to the Rainbow Bridge.
I called Cottage Pet Hospital and spoke to Nancy.  She explained how Pepper's final journey would be handled.
We took Pepper in on 12/03/2016 and said our tearful goodbyes.
Everyone there was very caring and we appreciate them so much for that during such a difficult time.
We later received a sympathy card signed by the whole staff.<//review>< Pics>

<text>**********PET OWNERS BEWARE********
My dog was diagnosed by Dr Sahai with heart failure approx over a year ago. He put my dog on Vetmedin, Lasix & Enalapril. Dr Sahai continued to authorize refills but not without a price. HIS policy requires unnecessary exams, bloodwork, urinalysis, xrays, etc. EVEN if your pet is on the last of their days in order to refill my dogs meds. I wanted my dog to be able to continue her meds the dr claims she needed. Although these meds did not help subside alot of her symptoms I feel like it slowed down the progression of her illness. With that said, it was time for yet another refill. So I called the office & Dr Sahai would not authorize another refill without an exam, bloodwork & urinalysis. No exceptions! So I took her in for her another exam. The front office staff tried to push additional testing yet again. We refused & said we would prefer to speak to the dr who is going to perform the exam. As we were already aware the “fill in” doctor stated our dog could pass any day now. He understood that we only came in because we had to & all we wanted was to refill her meds to keep her as comfortable for as long as possible until she passed. Tests weren’t going to help my dog in any way whatsoever. Tests were only going to tell us what we already knew & that is our dogs condition is getting worse. Anyhow, the fill in dr was very compassionate, withdrew ALL “so called required tests”, refilled her meds & we were on our way.  Today I called for another refill. Dr Sahai refused to authorize without the tests. He obviously only cares about money & not your pet. He didn’t care that she is dying. Once he found out I was gonna post this review he called me to harass me & because I hung up on him he called my husband & tried to offer him a discount for further testing instead of authorizing a refill. ***IF YOU LOVE YOUR PET, DO NOT COME TO COTTAGE PET HOSPITAL!!!!!***</text>< user_name>

Fully recommended if you think your pet is part of your family.
Big thanks to Dr Sahai who has been taking care of my pets from last 18 years. I have been taking 3 generations of my dogs to cottage pet hospital.
Dr Sahai is very professional. He will never suggest any extra medication or treatment if ur pet doesn’t need it. He treats ur pets as his pet.
And for his whole team there is only one word:- AWESOME.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< userid>

I took my dog, Lucky, here whenever he needed anything done. The staff has always been so kind and friendly. Last year, Lucky got so old that he couldn't stand as long, found it difficult to breathe and could no longer control his bladder. After nearly 16 years together, it was time to say goodbye. The staff allowed us as much time as we needed to say goodbye before and after the injection. A couple of weeks later, we received a condolences card from Cottage Pet Hospital. That extra mile they took by sending that card was just the most beautiful gesture and I will forever be grateful for how understanding and caring the staff were in one of the saddest moments in my life.< /text>

< Review>
I've tried a number of different vets in and around Anaheim over the years. I was looking for the ones who seemed the most competent, the most compassionate and who also provide care that we can afford.  We have found our veterinary home with Cottage Pet Hospital Inc.  Dr. Sahai was amazingly compassionate, skilled and dedicated. Him his staff have gone way beyond our expectations in helping us care for our family dog who had a very serious and difficult to treat condition.  They have worked with us in a collaborative way such us listening carefully to our concerns and gave us suggestions for the care of our dog.  We will be forever grateful for their help through that very difficult time.  If you want an amazing vet for your dog or cat, look no further.< /Review>

<review>I agree to Marti S. You must know I am the one who visit you this afternoon for the first time.

First, I already mentioned that I have a primary vet but it is closed on Sunday. I was worried that my boy wasn’t able to eat for few or several days. I came to get something that I can feed him. Fluid subcutaneous wasn't what I looked for, though I was looking for something else.

Doctor recommended me to hospitalize my boy. I should have straightly answered him that I am uncomfortable about hospitalizing because it could have killed him. He suggested many things, but I wanted to try again after he eats and gets energized. And, of course, I can do them in my primary vet. Reason for visit was to give him something since he couldn’t eat for awhile.

Things he recommended was total (around) $680. I chose to fluid subcutaneous and something that might help me to eat. As soon as the receptionist went out, I heard the doctor said, “That’s it?!” I should have left this place already. The receptionist’s attitude was, honestly disturbing.

Even at the emergency vet and other vets, I never needed to sign a paper *attached photo* I became very anxious signing the paper, which  I should have declined and walked out, after heard the doctor said, “That’s it?!” and with the attitude of the receptionist. I wasn’t able to trust them who took my boy back to the room. Are they upset because I refused the recommendation? What if they make my boy even sick?

And thank you. I don’t know what you have done to him. Or even if you didn’t do anything, I can tell my boy didn’t have a positive experience like at my primary vet.

He sounded very weak on the way back to home. Have no idea why but he started to have a breathing problem and became even weaker. I want to trust you, but I don’t know.

Sorry for only accepting “that’s it?!” options.

<Review>We live in Sacramento. Around 2005 we had a family vacation in Disneyland. Our Lhasa Apso dog named Lucy was still very young and had a lot of separation anxiety, When I found out the Cottage Pet Hospital was in Anaheim, we decided to take Lucy with us in our road trip and board her at the Cottage.

It was great to us to be able to visit Lucy each afternoon after our Disney events. The Hospital did a check up, and we were very impressed with the human warmth the staff treated us and the pets. Lucy had a great time since she was able to be with us in the road trip and we visited her everyday.

We liked Cottage Pet Hospital very much, and still remember after all this time.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Friendly and compassionate staff. Clean waiting room and rooms. The Dr.'s here really care about your pets and are very thorough on checking the animals when trying to figure out what might be wrong with them. I have been coming here for 15 years.< /Text>

Our kitty started having either a weird cough or asthma attack. I took a video and showed it to the Dr, who said to bring in the kitty ASAP. We mentioned we live 15 min away and they close in 15 min, so we asked if it was super urgent or if we should just come back the next day -- but Dr. Sahai said he wanted to see our kitty now and it wouldn't be a problem to show up a little late. We took 15 min to come back, I called on the way to confirm and gave our ETA and the nurse said it would be fine, however when we got there a few min later they wouldn't open their door. I had my cat with me on the sidewalk and knocked at least 15 times before they finally opened the door. A different nurse answered the door, raised her voice at me that the power was already shut down and everyone had left, and shut the door in my face as I explained we had JUST CALLED to confirm it was okay to show up 5 min late. It wasn't even 5 minutes past close.

We absolutely loved this vet up until then and never came back. If it wasn't for this instance I would give 5 stars.

Pros are:
+ Dr. Sahai is wonderful and absolutely amazing at diagnosis while being practical about cost (aka without going into debt)
+ If you are upfront in a polite manner or are like me and super stressed when you pet is sick (and have a million questions), the nurses will do whatever they can to help
+ No appointments needed on weekends for shots, it's a quick and easy
+ (Most) of the staff seem to really love pets and care about their well-being! Our pets love people and bond with the staff when they are in for treatment, which we really love and puts us at ease

Cons:
- There is a sarcastic doctor here that we do not jive well with, we feel she is not as straightforward when we ask her questions and she will often joke to us about how she never brings in her pets to the vet and just lets stuff in their bodies "work out on their own" (how is that professional).
- Sometimes staff would contradict the doctor's advice when we'd ask questions we thought of later -- I think you'll get this anywhere though
- They never remember my pet insurance covers flea medicine! Every time I come in and buy it, I have to pay full price and then get my insurance to work with Cottage Pet Hospital on proactively applying my discount and refunding me the rest. I think they don't even take my insurance anymore, good riddance anyway because I don't need a vet that will tell me to bring in my cat and they'll stay open for me, only to shut the door in my face.<//review>

We have trusted the team at Cottage Pet Hospital with our cat, Kobe, for years! From the standard check ups to a surgery, Dr. Sahai & his crew have nurtured my pet back to health each time. I highly recommend this location & staff with your fur babies!< /review>

<Review>During a stressful time when my little tortie cat Bug injured her leg, the cottage pet hospital was there for me, each one of their staff was personable and friendly, they identified the best solution for little Bug, and just as they said she was better in no time. Give these folks a shot if you're searching around, you won't regret it. Thanks for everything Cottage Pet Hospital< /Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Two years ago I had the bright idea that I would make some money on the side doing dog breeding. So I went out and bought a female French bulldog. Pure breed, paperwork, and all the bells and whistles. This thing cost me almost 5 grand. Well long story short that bright idea didn't workout to well.
I have been bringing little Misty to The Cottage Pet Hospital since the first day I brought her home. I don't have any dramatic life threatening stories about Misty but I guess that in itself is a compliment to Dr. S. He has always treated us like family, making sure Misty gets all her treatments and at the right time. As a first time dog owner, it was rough but I made it through thanks mostly in part to the staff at Cottage Pet Hospital. So I felt like should take some time and write something in their favor. Hope this review helps.<//Text>< Pictures>

The Dr.s are very good, and when my cat decided to eat 3 ft of yarn, they were great at progress reports and caring for my "inappropriate snack" kitty! She came through it without unnecessary and expensive surgery.
They do not push procedures that are costly and unnecessary, but will present all options to you.
They also worked with my little feral rescue. That was awesome.< /Review>< pics>

I had to take my dog in to be seen when she got an infection. I was so worried about what was going on with my girl and they worked to keep not just my dog calm, but me as well. The service I received there is some of the best I ever have. I highly recommend them to my friends with fur children. :)</text>

This place always felt like an extension to our family. We went only a handful of times but every time was caring, attentive and respectful. Structure-wise it's not Beverly Hills but that didn't seem to matter.

I'm devastated to say our four legged grandma's cancer got the best of her but I couldn't have asked for a better team to help us through the most difficult decision of helping her rest. They were supportive at every which way and not only thoroughly informative but a level of sympathy that allowed me to process everything without feeling judged or alone in the process, ultimatley helping me make a decision that I felt was best. From the bottom of my heart, I am grateful for this place and it's staff.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I adopted my senior chihuahua in January. One thing that comes with adopting a new pet is that you have no idea what their previous medical history is. My chihuahua is blind in one eye and was in dire need of a teeth cleaning. I was worried at first about putting my dog under due to his age but both Dr. Sahai and Dr. Ahrabi took the time to discuss the procedure with me and I felt much better. I also told them about a little cough I noticed him having lately. They were just as concerned as I was and suggested we take a few x-rays to see what the issue was. What my previous doctor told me were allergies ended up being a problem with his trachea and minor heart murmur. My dog is now on a healthy diet and medication to help him with these issues. While he lost a few teeth, his behavior has completely changed. He is happy and plays all the time! The care I received from everyone at this hospital has truly touched my heart. My dog is a senior and I know that I may only have a few years with him but they will be happy and healthy. Just talking with the staff you will understand how much they truly care about your animals. Seeing my dog happy and smiling was enough for me. I will never go anywhere else.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

From the first day we walked in with Gizmo the staff and Dr. Sahai have been amazing with our Baby. I am so glad we found Cottage Pet Hospital. They diagnosed Gizmo with Cushing Syndrome and together we worked out a treatment plan. We are very happy with the service they provide. Gizmo even likes going in for her check ups. Thank you Cottage Pet Hospital for making us a part of the family.</Review>

<rating>4</rating><Review>Cottage Pet Hospital offers a warm atmosphere and caring staff in convenient location for local residents.

Pet Treatment: I brought my cat in for treatment after she started scooting across the carpet. Without getting into details the diagnosis was quick and treatment was effective.

Facility: There is a strong smell in this facility similar to most animal shelters I've been in. The staff do constantly clean but the building is dated and may have absorbed years of patient odors. I often see the staff cleaning and disinfecting after each patient and they are currently remodeling the facility so hopefully they will be able to reduce the smell.

Price: The prices for treatment seem comparable to that of Banfield Pet Hospitals found in most Petsmarts. They also seem to accept most insurance plans.

Parking: Since this is a small clinic parking is limited and street side parking is typically taken my near by residents. However, there is usually at least one or two spots open from my experience.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dcd639b105604d:0xffb719dde3017c59< /GmapID></record>

<gmap_id>0x80dcd639b105604d:0xffb719dde3017c59<//gmap_id><Review>My mom got a puppy for her birthday last month as a gift from my father, and he was always active and by her side. She only had him for a month before they killed him with the simplest procedure. Do NOT trust them with anesthesia or sedatives, the dog went in for a simple procedure to get it's bandages removed and replaced and they put him to sleep for it. Why? I have no idea. He wasn't vicious and never growled at anyone. He was just a puppy. I'm a vet assistant myself, and anywhere will tell you that is malpractice. Not only did they overdose him and kill a perfectly healthy, active, and happy family member; they put him to sleep the day before for the same reason. Again, anywhere else will tell you not to sedate a puppy or any small animal within 24 hours of a previous dose of anesthesia. It was Dr. Ahrabi. He didn't even have the nerve to apologize to my father who went in and picked up the puppy's collar and say goodbye. My whole family is heartbroken, the puppy really brightened everyone's day with his happy and active attitude. My mom hasn't eaten or slept much, she is heartbroken beyond belief. She treats every animal like a child of her own, and I inherited that from her. They killed her puppy, our family member, and then called her shortly after; asking her to come in to fill out forms to cremate him. She had to send my father in, and we answered the phone for her, as she couldn't bare to talk to them after what they did. We heard them changing stories on what had happened each time they attempted to explain it. We are pursuing legal action for this malpractice and emotional distress and damage this has caused our family, especially to my mom. BEWARE. BE CAUTIOUS. Don't just assume that because they have a high average of reviews, they won't do the same to your family member. No animal should be sedated for a simple procedure just because the vet is scared to get bitten, that's part of the job you signed up for. If you know how to properly restrain an animal, you don't need drugs to get something done. I want to inform others of what they've done to prevent this from happening any other companions.<//Review>< pics>

I have been bringing my dog, Tammy, to Dr. Sahai for about 3 years now and she is doing great.  Dr. Sahai and his staff are the best and take excellent care of Tammy.  Tammy has a couple of conditions that are a bit rare and not on most Vet's radar, so it is with certainty that I say Tammy is alive because of the care that she gets at Cottage Pet Hospital.  I would recommend Cottage Pet Hospital to anyone with a pet.< /text>

<text>Very nice people! Didn't try to sell me EVERY vaccination/shot they offered, as other vet clinics do. I went with no appointment and was in and out very quickly. No complaints.

I came in because my cat had an abscess on her face that ruptured blood all over my kitchen. I freaked out and took work off to take her to a vet. They cleaned it up nicely and gave her an antibiotic in a shot and  in a gel for me to rub on in her ear for a few weeks. They didn't guilt me into spending 300+ dollars on a bunch of other things as other places had.<//text>< Rating>

<review>My girlfriend has this chubby little trouble maker Pug breed dog name Lucas. At this Christmas family party, he was playing about and suddenly we realized that there was a bar of chocolate (herseys) opened  and he ate half of the bar. Since we've been told that if dogs ate chocolate, they might die, we got frighten and we didn't know what to do.

One of my family members told us about Cottage Pet Hospital and we rushed the Lucas to there right away. This waiting period was a nightmare for us. After the examined Lucas, they told us that everything would be OK and just to be more careful next time. BOY were we relief.

Cottage Pet Hospital did a great and professional job. In the end, we are very glad everything was good.< /review>< Resp>

However, I had an experience with them when a friend and I found a lost dog.
We took him there to be checked for a chip. Because we were going to board him for a day, they took my information of course.
Even though the owner was found while we were still there, the file remained active.
Then I started to get nasty grams from the shelter that his Rabies vacc. was past due. Though I wrote 3 times and called twice, these people are apparently morons. (The shelter.)
After much frustration, I reached out to Cottage for help. I wish I could recall the name of the Office Manager who helped me, but it has been a while.
She was so helpful.
She faxed the entire story and situation to the shelter for me. She did not have to do that. That finally straightened it out and I stopped receiving notices.
As far as I could see, the staff were all very friendly, the office was clean, and if I did not have a long term vet I love, I would probably go there.<//Text>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I contacted Cottage Pet Hospital because I had the unfortunate, yet inevitable duty of putting my dear friend to sleep. It was an emotional moment for the family and the staff handled it with great kindness and care. If a friend was ever in need of such a service, I would definitely recommend them here.

Of course you should always call ahead to make sure you get a the right service/price quote for what you're looking for. I ended up only needing the cremation services :(. It was a little bit extra, but we sprung for the small box of ashes and paw print on a clay disk, $125. They also sent me a nice card in the mail that the staff signed. It was a nice touch.<//Review>< response>

< Review>
My puppy is a small chihuahua mix, she's only 9 months, still a baby and I regret having her spayed by cottage pet hospital. I've had plenty of puppies/dogs in the past and their spaying process was NOTHING like this. They asked me to drop my puppy off between 7:30am-9am and that the sooner I brought her the sooner they could start and finish. I drop her off at 7:30am and they tell me she'll be sitting in a kennel from 7:30am until they start at noon. When I asked why she had to wait so long and if we could wait with her as she has never been kenneled, I was told "that's our procedure and you cannot wait with her". When I picked her up after her surgery her tail was between her legs, she was shaking, had a swollen neck, butchered nails all cut different lengths and into her quick, with the most swollen butchard scar I've EVER seen out of all 6 dogs I've had my whole life. When we got home later than night and I removed her bandage and I had to get heavy duty scissors just to cut through it because it had hardened from how much blood had soaked and dried through the bandage. She took two days to come out of her drug state and start eating again. Never again will I take another puppy of mine there. After she gets her stitches get removed, we will be going to Banfeild Pet Hospital  from petsmart for her check ups. This was surprising to me as normally they are very great, however, they seemed to have been busy that day we took her in so I feel they clearly brushed her aside and "manhandled" her surgery to ensure they get through all their patients. I was very saddened.</Review>

<Text>I have never been to this hospital for visits. My 8 year old yorkie, Rocky, recently passed away. My friend found the hospital on her phone and called asking about burial service. The receptionist was very helpful. She gave us all the information and directions to the hospital. We had 15 mins to make it at the 630pm cut off time. When we arrived they were very sweet and sympathatic. I was too upset to talk and my friend had to handle everything for me. I am so thankful for everyone in the hospital. They had sent out a card to me the next day. It was signed by all the employees including the doctors. Seeing that card made me broke down and cried. I felt very touched and love sent from the hospital.  I did not expect that. I appreciate the thoughtfulness from the hospital. I feel like Rocky is in good hands and it made me feel a lot better knowing the fact that people who don't even know you can still care about your loss. Thank you Cottage Pet Hospital.<//Text>< user>

She explained things to the point of drawing on a napkin the details of how the mouth works and why my doggy was having issues...(i so wanted to keep that drawing to brag how awesome she was! lol) The other thing was price. I make very little, and I mean VERY LITTLE money so when they gave me pricing finally they werent upselling things to get my money. It was more of here is what it cost.. with what they recommend, then extra options if I was interested but no pressure, then showing me what options are recommended, but not nessesary, to cut my cost as much as possible. They didnt look at me as if I was a bad dog owner for not getting an antibiotic because to me it wasnt nessesary but done as a precaution, or dental check up while she was under for something else. They were just really great! Thnx for taking care of my brat, Princess! I learned alot!<//text>< Pics>

<review>I have been coming to this pet hospital for over 6 years. AT first I was very pleased with my pets' care, but the past few visits I have been over charged. The Dr. makes me feel like everthing that he recommends is urgent and necessary, causing me to spend more on vet bills than I can afford. Now I am in debt for about $3,000 or more by using care credit. The last time I was there was this month, May 2016, and I was required to get blood work done on my 9 year old cat before he would clean her teeth. I asked for the presurgical pannel and was being charged for the full blood panel and urinalysis add on. I had to complain that this was not what I wanted and the ladies in the front made a big deal about it because the lab work was already performed. I was able to pay the amount of the smaller panel, but only after much debate. Then a few days later I called becuase I wanted to pick up some cat food for my cat that has kidney issues and was told that the vet requires me to have  blood work done for my cat before I could pick up the prescritption diet KD eventhough they knew I was just there a few days ago and spent $700 to get my cat's teeth cleaned. I am very upset with this pet hospital now and will not reccommend this place to anyone. All the vet caares about is charging for anything and everything that he can get. He doesnt care about his repeat loyal customers. He just wants more money to put towards the add-on to the pet hospital that they are currently working on. I suggest you find a vet that will tell you the truth in what is really needed and not make you feel that uneccessary things are.</review>< Pics>

<review>Well, I wanted to give this place a try, bad bad service, they didn’t like that I wanted regular nail polish for my Pedi, even tho I got the  paraffin wax, they got upset  and didn’t even care to show me when I can dry the color, the girl who did my toes and nails was laughing all the time in a silly way  that was very disrespectful and annoying , waist of time and money,<//review>< pictures>

I asked my friends to be my bridesmaids at this place. They were very friendly and they did an awesome job. They gave us complementary apple cider in champagne glasses. Overall everybody had a good time.</Review>

The place looks modern and comfy but they nickel and dime you for everything. Not worth the wait; dry greeting at the door, the lady I had was slow and meticulous which is great when the shop is empty or you have no appointments waiting... I was handed a stack of gel colors that was thicker than my 6 inch medical journal. They offered everyone around me a drink (soda or water) but failed to offer me anything... The front desk chick rushed through potential (walk-in/scheduled) clients and talked to they staff as if they were children... Take off acrylic = $5. Plain color gel $28. If you want ‘rockstar’ sparkles, add at least $15 more... $50 for a full set... Came in with a friend and was asked if I was paying for the friend at least three times... After I said no the first time why keep asking me!?! No massage chair for the pedicure. Be ready to step up onto a pedestal in order to get your pedicure...  This was a one and DONE experience and I will NEVER come back!</text>

That made it so easy to pick the color you were looking for. Looks like the current management doesn't take the time to do that. Also, making an appointment is hit and miss. Sometimes they'll see you, other times they won't. They still have a ton of color options, which tempts me to go there. But there are better salons in the area now.< /text>< Pictures>

Called right when they opened Friday morning I had the day off and wanted to start with a nice pedicure. They open 1 hour earlier than the other salons in the area. The gal told me come on in. She did not indicate that they were busy and had several incoming appts. They were very busy with a younger crowd, Lots of people for 9:15 a.m. the salon is well kept and very nice looking. HERES MY ISSUE....waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for my pedicure to begin. All the workers talk loudly amongst themselves and laugh and carry On. They make no we contact to anyone waiting, ever, and they don’t seem to be in any hurry to get on to the next customer. The very young , heavy-set gal at the front desk is nice when you first arrive but doesn’t command the team like most front desk people do that work in salons. The workers just talk , talk , talk and they don’t care how many people are waiting. After one hour I was finally put in the chair and there I waited another 15 minutes before she started on me. She was slow and kept getting up to get things instead of having them all ready to begin with. She worked on me for about 4 minutes before she started scolding me for the shape of my toenails as if I waited 2 years to do in! I have health issues and my skin is a bit tough, this is normal for my condition. I also have Arthritis which you can totally tell by looking at all my crooked toes. I don’t need to be scolded. If I could do it myself I would.
So while she’s telling me what awful shape my feet are in I’m correcting her and explaining that I have health issues. I don’t need to be scolded, I didn’t do anything wrong. I can’t help that I have health issues. I try to go once a month for a pedi but I admitted it was 7 weeks. SO WHAT! This is what you do for a living so take the good with the bad. Anyhow, she did take time with me but left out a couple things because of my sensitivity. She painted my toes and left and didn’t come back! The front desk gal wanted to boot me out with wet toes because SHE NEEDED THE CHAIR, after I waited 1.15 to even begin my pedicure. Seriously!? Then, she got upset and decided to not speak to me nicely like she was doing with everyone else. I had to give her the tip for my gal because she disappeared and never came back. Typically they help you put your sandals on and help you up and out when your a bit older - which I am. I not even know if my person got her tip.
Anyhow, my experience left me feeling really sad that these young ladies treat the older generation with such a lack of caring and a high level of disrespect. They too will get old one day and perhaps not be able to move well and care for themselves as they did before. I wonder if you treat your moms this badly? Or if you would appreciate it if she were treated that way??
****ONE TIP.....their chairs are on a platform and you have to step way up which might not be possible for everyone, older, pregnant, disabled. If you have any problems with stairs or stepping up, don’t go here. ******< /Review>

Worst nail shop ever. I had to wait 20 minutes for a mani even tho there were only 2 other customers inside. The girl at the counter has a very bad attitude, she tried to sit someone that came in after me. They don’t use clean tools and the whole shop looks dirty. They keep equipment in rusty containers. They don’t have a good selection of polish. The shop smells like rotten fish.</Text>

place is a bit more pricey than others, they do good pedicures with hot stone massage for an extra charge but the girls there have a full blown, loud  conversation in their language while helping you which I think is rude< /review>

<Text>Their mani pedi was great. However they messed up my eyebrows and after I told the lady she made one way shorter from the front than the other she said it was fine even though it was very noticable. Now I’m stuck with them till they grow back. 3 stars total though bc their nails did come out nice.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I wish I didn't have to give any stars for this place. Yesterday I went for the very first time and was very disappointed in the service I received. I called at 10am and made a 1pm appointment. I told the girl that I'm going on my 1 hour lunch break and asked if there would be enough time for me to get a acrylic full set and a pedicure. She said yes. No problem see you at 1pm. So I get there at 1:07 and the place is packed. I check in with her and she says ok choose your color so I do. By now it's already 1:20. I asked if she's sure she'll have time. Then she says. Yes I'll take you right now. So she has me sit in a seat for 5 min then tells me to sit in a seat where they have the tub for your feet. Mind you. They didn't clean up the previous persons trash that was left behind. Disgusting. Before the woman starts on my hands. I ask her to be careful on my hand because I have a few cuts on them. One by my nail in particular. Then she goes on with her work and eventually scratches my wound. Anyway when I'm all done I go to pay and the lady asked if everything is ok. I say no. You left trash there. It's 2:30 I'm late for work. My nails could have used one more coat of polish. They could have been cleaned up underneath too. Also they left glue stuck on my fingers. Also told her why make an appointment if your not gonna follow through she said well it's because it's the holidays and I had two people work on you since you said your on lunch break which we normally don't have two people work on one person. Which is a lie. My co worker is the one who referred me saying they always have two people work on her. I'm never going back. Thanks for nothing.</Text>

Small, some might even say quaint, not much to look at building but serves up faster than the one in the grocery store here in Willits. Less expensive too and to top it off, tastes better too & it's drive through. I said it already but I will say it again. My wife and I just love this place and all the ladies running it.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Wonderful. A must.  Better than Starbucks and I would rather support a small business that does a great job instead of a greedy conglomerate.</Text>

<Review>Great coffee and the girls were super friendly and fast with my order. Would most definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get coffee that doesn't want to wait in a long line or is in a hurry.</Review>< pictures>

<name>Paul Keough< /name><Date>1532031945472< /Date><Rating>2<//Rating><Text>I asked for a caramel flavored blended drink which they call milky way flavor. It still said it had coffee and i was hot from the gym so I got it. I had to throw the drink away after about 3 sips it was so insanely sweet. It tasted like pure caramel syrup. The whipped cream they piled on even though i asked for there not to be any was less sweet than the actually drink. It had no coffee flavor so I am assuming there wasn't any. I felt sick in the stomach after I had it and still feel awful, even from the small amount I had. My sister had a smoothie which tasted like they added sweetening syrup, it was actually drinkable though. I am never going here again. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the staff were nice and the coffee ny dad had wasn't bad.</Text>< pictures>

Loved it!  1st time customer. Very nice people. Great coffee and yummy pastries.
My Americano w/ honey and cream, PERFECT!!! Fresh fruit too :) I kept adding to my order, she kept going and smiling.
Definitely making this a Waypoint for 101 travelers.
Thank you<//review>

<text>UPDATE: I stopped by yesterday 1/4/19 to get coffee again... Ordered the same drink. Tasted watery and pretty sure I only got 1 shot instead of two. I got half-n-half instead of heavy cream and my 24oz cup wasn't even halfway full (paid for 12oz) I didn't go back because I was driving. Not really happy with the girl working there either. Seemed like she was being held prisoner by the look on her face.

FIRST EXPERIENCE: Great coffee. My Americano was not bitter or watery. Service was top notch and they actually confirmed my order. Will stop by again.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Response>None< /Response><review>Perfect. I asked for a basic just Carmel type blended drink and she didnt ask what one or what I wanted in it short of asking if I needed wip or not. The coffee was perfect. Someone who can take a suggestion and make a delicious drink off menu is someone who does their job right.

Quick service! Love the drive through, very friendly staff. Not sure if the cafe au lait is my fave but still good enough that I will try some other drinks next time I'm in town! Tasted like a decent dark roast, just sometimes I have to be in the right mood< /Text>

We always try to stop at this drive-thru kiosk on our way through Willits. Not only is the service fast and friendly, the Big Train sugar-free blended mochas are hard to beat! A note about the decor rating - not really their fault, they're in an equipment yard next to the freeway. I gave them a "good" rating because the do have an awning over the windows - really a smart idea during the winter rains, asnd it didn't suck to get a shady respite on the hot first day of autumn, either!< /Text>

<review>Smaller version of other Murray Family Farms I loved as well. Same great citrus and avocados. Less of a selection, not a gas station too, but same cherry-painted design on water tower, and general color theme without the outdoor seating, etc. Good selection of samples.

I had eaten most of what I got at the other location, and had been lamenting I wouldn't be able to find excellent citrus again for a while--then we saw this!

Perfect for restocking on the go!< /review>< gmapID>

Little cute place run by polite lady.
We went there on august 8 ,They had almost every fruit that grown from that field except the cherries. Cherries coming from Washington because they are already picked them up

They How kinds of preserves ,honeys that you should try for sure.

They also have a nice restroom very clean organize.</Review>

Super friendly and clean. Plus a great selection of treats. We picked up some finger grapes,  a jar of salted vodka rib glaze and honey. The homemade fudge is also looks incredible. Definitely worth stopping by and it's easy to get back on the freeway</Text>

What a great place to get home made organic jam, organic honey, fruits and nuts. All organic. Very clean and air conditioned interior. The kid working there is so polite and accommodating. Pleasant person to have a conversation and very knowledgeable about his products. You will not be disappointed. They have refreshments too.</text>

Neat place if you want fresh veggies and such.
Same 2 "kids" workings there when I stopped several yrs ago. On that trip my debit card wasn't working so while I was on the phone trying to get it figured out the young man came out and gave me the apples and melon I was trying to buy. WOW!!! I won't forget that and will stop in any time I'm in that area.</review>

Just tried varieties of mandarins and grapefruit I've never heard of - bursting with flavor. No beautiful so you know it has tons of good flavor. Homemade corn nuts are outstanding, as is orange jalapeno marmelade and Hatch Chile green corn salsa. Just off the 5, a mile from the 99 junction. Cherry trees are blooming.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Passed by on a whim after being parched from the drive and seeing signs for fresh strawberries. Such a pleasant little find! Their strawberries were wonderful and sweet! I also bought some great honey sticks and my favorite of all was their homemade oatmeal raisin cookie. They are to die for, I would 100% reccomend this adorable little shop!< /review>

<Text>My daughter and I were on our way home from a trip to Santa Cruz and we saw the roadsigns for Murray Family Farms.  We loved the rocky road and caramel varieties of fudge, the fresh fruits, and sugar-glazed nuts too! Also bought some vine-ripe tomatoes (yum!). It was such a delightful roadside stop, and I will definitely do it again whenever I am traveling either the 5 or the 99!  Beautiful store and most friendly family/staff!</Text></record>

The web site says that the place is open until 8pm every day. We came at 7pm and it was closed. Just lost 10-15 minutes going of the highway and back. The correct information about hours of operation would be appreciated.</text>

I travel from PASADENA To SAN JOSE every week. I NEVER drive past this market on my way home.  Load up with FRESH,  FARM to HOME fruit and vegetables.  of I ever showed up at home without a box full of produce, my wife would make my life miserable.</Text>

<text>We love Murray Farms on Copus Road. We found them a few years ago on a trip to LA.  They are about 25 miles from us and we enjoy taking the back roads through the farms to get there. We order pies from them for special events or just call ahead to see if they have our favorite and it's sitting on the counter waiting for us when we arrive. They have the best TriTip sandwiches too if you're looking for lunch. We always end up with jams, fudge, fresh fruits/vegetables or some kind of many snack options. We were so sad to hear about their fire last year, but are so excited to see they will soon be open again. See you all soon. 😋</text>< Pics>

<review>We drove from Santa Clarita to the Little Purple Barn and as always truly enjoyed ourselfs. Got a cherry pie, fudge, garlic vegies, pulots, peaches, yellow watermelon, olives, honey and marmalade. Great trip. Also learned they're out here at COC on Sundays at the farmers market. We'll have to try that. Love this place.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I feel incredibly lucky to have found a kind, compassionate and experienced dentist office here in Lincoln.  I was in pain, and was seen quickly after my 1st call.  Truly a caring group of ladies!
And Dr. Hermo is fabulous!  Gets right to work and checks in continuously to make sure you are comfortable.  I highly recommend Dr. Hermo and her staff!< /review>

I highly recommend "Tooth Spa Dentistry".  I've been a customer for about 4 years and have received excellent care.I had veneers put on and have received exceptional service.  They are quick to fit me in for appointments and I've never had to wait.  The dentist and staff are very friendly, caring, gentle and a pleasure to interact with.  I look forward to my visits.  They even have a massage chair which is an absolute bonus.  I am so pleased with the service I receive.< /Review>

We’ve been here at Tooth Spa  Dentistry  since 2017 until now, We love everything about it from the ambiance to the staff and Doctors, everyone is so accomodating and professional. The Doctor is really good she knows  her stuff by heart. Staff are diligent, reminding you every now and then about  sched and stuff , for someone like  me who always forgot stuff i really appreciate it. Glad we found this clinic when we moved in Lincoln,  we can smile widely without hesitations. 😊<//review>

Haphazard Dentistry. Highly Unprofessional.

- I recieved 7 fillings total: 4 of them have either fallen out or had to be replaced, just three months later.
- I saw the 'hygienist' reuse old gloves, and he kept burping in my face.
- My 'cleaning' was conducted wit a water pik, no metal instruments.

Conclusions: Poor communication, appalling hygiene, and my teeth have been in pain ever since. The lists of complaints goes on, but I don't want to appear to be dramatic--simply stating the facts of a terribly impactful and unbelievably poor treatment.< /Text>

Absolutely wonderful team! I've had a fear of dentists ever since I had a bad experience when I was a child. I hadn't been to a dentist in years and was pretty embarrassed about my condition. Everyone at Tooth Spa made me feel totally comfortable. They were polite, kind, professional, extremely knowledgeable, to the point and fun all at the same time. They were very sensitive to my comfort during the session. Also they use the most modern and up to date technology, which definitely helps you feel more relaxed and confident in the chair. Not to mention they play great music in there! I won't be missing checkups anymore 🙂<//Review>

Made appointment,  hadn't been to dentist for a few years , I have sensitive teeth.  Informed them I EXTREMELY sensitive,  they said no worries.  They  reschedule twice , due to covid-19.  ( I'm ok with that)
Then LITERALLY just a couple of hours before my appointment,  they  called me and said they wouldn't work on me because of how sensitive I am. Again they cancelled my appointment. They said from beginning, they would have no problem working on me, they would give a topical if needed.. when they cancelled,  (day of, 2 hours before appointment)NOW they won't use topical..
This place is a complete joke..
So disappointed with them..
Very very dissatisfied..< /text>

The dentist here is very kind and friendly. I have been a few times now and she listens to my concerns. I am a very anxiety filled patient. She gets it and has adjusted my appointments to accommodate my needs. Happy with my care.</Text>

The experience at tooth spot dentistry is one of the better dentist offices that I have experienced. Wait times are very little, and the expertise, professionalism, and friendliness is a great thing in my book.   I have to drive one hour to go see Irene and the whole experience with the driving time in mind makes me feel more at ease with the above stated.  Dr. Irene has skilled hands that did my deep cleaning without numbing shots (obviously with the numbing gel though!).   I highly recommend going to tooth spa dentistry if your current dentist makes things seem a bit difficult at times and your curiosity might change your dentist!</Text>

I have an irrational fear of the dentist, all dentists.  I made a long-overdue appt at Tooth Spa after reading about their practice online.  I was initially terrified but the whole staff from start to finish made me feel comfortable and at ease (without happy gas).  Highly recommend if you're a nervous nelly like me.</review>

I was new to the area and had a semi emergency root canal needed. They were able to get me in quickly and proceed with a root canal. They were friendly and the doctor took her time to make sure it was done correctly. I was pleasantly surprised with the entire process.</Text>

<Text>Unfortunatley, my experience was terrible! Receptionist is incompetent with appointment information, was very rude and unprofessional. I have been a registered dental assistant for 20 years ( retired out) and know how a great office should be handled. I didn't even stay for my appointment as I had such a bad vibe from her and her poor attitude. New patients beware about going to this office with this front office woman. I have never, ever had such a bad experience going to a new business.<//Text>< Resp>

I went in for a cleaning and checkup.  They couldnt do what I needed in the time frame so they re-scheduled me for the next day.   I had to check with my babysitter and said I would let them know within one hour of leaving the office.  My sitter wasn't available at that time so I called and let them know right away (within one hour of leaving their office). They told me "I cant cancel or reschedule my appt. " Or I will be charged $50.  They said they require 48 hour notice. However ,I had just left the office one hour ago when they scheduled the next day appt. Which didnt make sense i would be charged $50. I then made a follow appt.  when I could. When i got to the office the receptionist said she "cancelled my appt. " I had the appt scheduled for 6 weeks. It Was real inconvienant.  They then sent me a letter saying I cant come back because they claim "I missed two appointments?" They cancelled my appt   I was there.   Im Rather surprised at this treatment.  I'm a single mother and only rescheduled one appt within a hour of making it.   I made all other appts.  Dont go here unless you like your appt cancelled and no one notify you. Dont go here if in the event you have a emergency come up and have to reschedule.  They will steal $50 from you and make it difficult to return or not want your business anymore.  I doubt they will stay in business long with the way they treat people<//text>

< Review>
I was skeptical trying a dentist that takes DHMO. Usually their all about bringing up their patient numbers and not about building a  great practice. I needed an emergency root canal. I contacted Premier Access Dental. While I was on the phone with Customer Service I was yelping for a good dentist in my area. Tooth Spa Dentistry cake up with great reviews. I called the office on Friday afternoon and spoke with the Office Manger (she is maxing) and she was able to get me in on Monday. I went into the office and they were very professional. The office is beautiful and calming. Very impressive. Dr. Hermo was super educational and patient with me. I was put on antibiotics and asked to come back on Thursday for the root canal. I was fortunate to get a call on Tuesday and asked to come in on Wednesday morning at 8:30. Dr. Hermo came in on her day off and took 3 1/2 hours out of her day to do an amazing job on my mouth. She continually checked on me and asked how I was doing. When my dental insurance switches to Delta Dental PPO I will be able to stay with her. She takes many different dental plans because she believes every patient should be given top notch care regardless of your dental plan. The root canal was done back in March of this year. As of today, I had my first cleaning with the office. The dentist did my cleaning personally. She knows I’m scared to death when a denstist works in my mouth. She kept asking me if I was ok. I feel this is the best dentist I have used to date!!! She has the best office staff as well!!!< /Review>

<text>Great little Mediterranean Food spot. Nice mixture of seafood options as well to go with standard fair of meats & veggies. All food is fresh and made to order. Friendly staff and reasonable prices and the quantity is plentiful. You will not be disappointed with flavor profile as all as everything was fully seasoned. Overall, a spot I will be visiting again when in the downtown Long Beach area< /text><gmapID>0x80dd31f4ddb67849:0xca4d50524f3d090c</gmapID>< time>

Great food, good prices, good customer service and location is ideal for foot traiffic and deliveries. This is a new restaurant and I hope they can survive during this pandemic.
I was a pleased and have no complaints as a first time customer.
I will return and recommend this restaurant.
Thank you!<//review>

Usually a great place that I regularly go to. But they're offering less and less. They've cut season fries, all soups and now alternative milks from they're offering. Has the boss just stopped caring?<//review>

It takes a lot of guts to open up next to Panda Express and serve the same style food, but 21M delivers! A three-item combo is only slightly more expensive than a two-item combo at Panda, and comes with two sides and a drink included! And it's very flavorful, not sitting around like Panda is sometimes. The Teriyaki chicken was so good! Definitely will come back.</Review>

<Text>Came across it passing through the area. Really glad I did. The mayo shrimp was delicious, fried but not greasy at all, batter had a light texture. A box gives you quite a bit to munch on at a reasonable price. The avocado smoothie was refreshing.</Text><gmapID>0x80dd31f4ddb67849:0xca4d50524f3d090c<//gmapID><Date>1548690521472< /Date><Response>None< /Response></record>

Food was great it was my first time and my wife's as well, food was exactly what I was expecting, no that one review where it says it will make you sick is baloney! That person was probably already feeling sick before eating there. Hands down really good food great service as well! Will return one day soon! Thank you guys</review>

This place is delicious, but a giant unorganized mess. If you place an order online, apparently that goes to the boss (who is not at the location) and the boss texts the order to the employee that’s working. But if the boss forgets or the employee doesn’t check their phone, you will be charged and your order will NOT be waiting for you.</text>

<text>This place has an exellent food. One great meal for less $10.00 The orange chicken with pineapple chunks it's delicious. The shrimps cooked to perfection and brocoli simply to die for.  Brown rice at no extra cost and one more side
The place clean, and comfortable. The service prompt and the guy at the front desk attends you with big smile. You get more than the next door place.</text><resp>None<//resp><user_id>102285984691361804937< /user_id>< pics>

The food is not the greatest but it does taste good and they give you alot for the price. The boba drinks are perfection ;) I would recommend the spicy popcorn chicken if you go visit.

<text>My gf and I tried this place out as were walking by during their soft opening.  A girl was handing out free samples and it tasted pretty good so we tried one of their milkteas.  The prices for the drinks are amazing.  $4-5 for a 24 oz is a really good deal.  The quality and taste of the milktea was really good too.  About the same level as Hiccups or Sharetea.  I especially liked their boba, which was warm and chewy with the right amount of bounce.  I'm so happy that a good boba place finally opened up near downtown LB.  No more having to drive to Cerritos for a decent boba drink. I plan to go back and try out their food.  I hope it's as good as the drinks.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Quite simply the best Porsche 992 service in the United States. Erik has been looking after my baby for the past 10 years.  He is a diagnostic genius and only recommends what needs to be done. I called his cell on a Sunday morning about 5 years ago because the alarm malfunctioned and I could not get the car to start after a hike in Will Rogers. He immediately had a fix.< /text>

<Review>I am very disappointed with their work.  They took my car for three days just to change the oil.  They returned my car with two large scratches, dirty outside and inside with oil stains.  They made me wait another two hours to solve these problems, in the end they didn't solve anything.  This service is not for premium cars.< /Review>< Name>

Kurt Bonzell made me the happiest Porsche owner this side of the Mississippi.  I purchased a used Porsche 911 Turbo S a few months ago, and I had some missing records including some of the service history. I contacted Porsche in Beverly Hills, verified my identity, and even though it was many years ago, Kurt was able to was able to see my service history, retrieve (2) repair orders and also include the Factory Build Sheet and the car's Warranty Service History.

These days, most businesses only help you when they are going to make money off you. This work in no way benefited Porsche if Beverly Hills, but they went above and beyond to help me retain as much of the rich history as possible pertaining to  my Porsche. Thank you very much!  I, along with any of the ensuing owners of my car, will be forever grateful. 🙏<//text>

<review>Brought car in due to Engine warning light which they resolved and had them do an oil service. Also asked them to recharge my battery which had gone dead due to little use.
Prior to picking up the car they called and advised:
-Car needs new front and rear brakes.
-Battery didn't take a charge and needs to be replaced
-Rear tires need replacement.
I informed them that I did not want them to proceed with any of these items.
Turns out brake replacement can wait until a warning light comes on (which may be several thousand miles away) and did not need immediate replacement.
Battery did in fact take a charge and has been fine since I picked the car up.
Rear tires were recently replaced and a tire store confirmed they were fine.
The quote for the above items was over $4,000...

<name>Belle Zhang</name><time>1554397768631</time><Text>Scott and Jon did it again for me! Another pleasant experience servicing my car at BH Porsche. Everything from start to finish was a breeze here. These guys really understand that everyone in LA is in a hurry and got me in and out efficiently while addressing my questions and concerns. All car/payment/pricing questions were very clearly answered leaving me very comfortable with the entire process. Would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone who has any problems with their Porsche.

And let me just talk about the rental car that I got... 2019 Porsche Cayenne! Definitely coming back to get this new baby once it's time for this one to go. Almost didn't want to return the rental car because it was just an amazing vehicle.

Ask for Scott if you need any help! He's the best.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

The car is less then a year old and cost me nothing but the service department is so rude and unresponsive that I would never buy another Porsche and would definitely never return to Porsche Beverly Hills for anything in the world. Best way to describe this place is rude and incompetent.  It is really hard to hate a place this much when it is a free service.  Welcome to Beverly Hills Porsche.</Review>< Name>

At 6pm I get an email my car is ready. I head over in the morning at 8am and wait another half an hour while they locate my car, only to tell me it isn’t washed yet, so another 15minutes. For this horrible service I’m also paying 2x the prevailing rates. Oh, and that free rental, they charged me $79 for it. Don’t waste your time with these clowns.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I have seen significant changes in the service department recently that have improved the entire experience from dropping off my car to picking it up.I was kept informed during the entire time they had my car to having a friendly gentleman with a red Porsche hat helping me retrieve all my belongings out of the loaner car and into mine . Great service thanks< /review>

<user_name>Laura B< /user_name><Review>This is my first time using the BH Porsche Service Center. I'm happy to say they made this a very easy experience. They fixed the problem, luckily it was still covered by the warranty. Mario was fantastic. He explained the problem with my car and what they were doing to fix it. He didn't recommend any additional service at this time...I'm always concerned the first time I take my car somewhere that I'll be told I have other things that need to be replaced...that was not the case. They were honest and did great work.< /Review>< time>

<Text>Based upon the snotty attitude of the guy I just talked to in service, contrasted with the complete empathy and care I received on the phone with Downtown Porsche, the disparity is VERY clear.  Stay away from Beverly Hills Porsche if you can avoid them.  Downtown is worth the drive and their attitude of complete customer care CANNOT BE BEAT!</Text>< pics>

<review>An extremely rude person running the business. Essentially insulted us and made it clear that our lack of cheese knowledge was not going to be welcome in the store. Stay away unless you're in the mood for being insulted. You'll get that by the pound here! If you're really trying to support small business, find another one!</review>< pictures>

<Review>Exceptional store, quite unique.  Not only fine cheese, but other great food items including salami, red cabbage, pine nuts, much more.  Small sample size cheese at front counter.  Sounds like French music from back in the day playing to really get that old school European vibe.  Owner has been here 34 years.< /Review><Name>Jason Ruderman<//Name><date>1602865185539</date><Response>None<//Response><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

< Review>
Favorite cheese shop in SF. Great staff with friendly and helpful suggestions about the delicious cheese. I have found new flavors here, highly recommend. During this covid crisis please be considerate to the staff here and wear a mask properly. They are extremely nice and should be shown respect and protected. They have an open door and fan for air circulation but need customers to be considerate too.</Review>

<review>Today, I went to buy cheese to this shop.
The woman was immediately very rude to me. It took me some time to understand that it was because she didn't like me having a backpack (full of vegetables from the farmer market)When I suggested that she could speak nicely, she stopped to cut the cheese and asked me to leave.
I told her that it was discrimination. She pushed the door on me and yelled at the other worker to call the police (which he didn't do)... Then she saws a police car outside, she ran toward them yelling "police, police" and pointing at me yelling "harasser"!
I had a nice discussion with the police officers. They told me that unfortunately, as a business owner, she can refuse to serve to anyone. "This is not how business should be done. There's nothing we can do. We are not the moral police, we can't  tell people how to behave" is what they told me.
Reading the other comments about this woman rudeness and racism doesn't surprise me.
If you want to spend a nice day in Noe Valley, Stay away from this shop!</review>< Pics>

<Review>Great selection, truly helpful and amazing service. I had planned to go to four different stores to get ready for a cocktail party I was throwing that evening, and I managed to get everything I needed there with the help of the staff. I will return again for all of my wine and cheese needs.</Review></record>

They could easily be a five star, but the staff is hit and miss. It is a well stocked cheese shop with a good charcuterie selection (five star). When Larry is working, the service is great, he is super knowledgeable and always helpful (five star). When the older petite woman is working, I don't bother to go in anymore. She is outright rude, disrespectful, and couldn't care less (less than one star).< /text>

I will not patronize this shop again because of the lack of curtesy and customer service at this cheese shop. Cheers and good luck to your business. Merry Christmas.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I want to like this place, but my experiences with the owners or staff in there have been very negative, not just rude, but racist.

I like Jamon Iberico, and they have that once in a while.

One time, I ask for it, and the guy clerk says "we do have it, but it just arrived, so I will not open the package for just a quarter of a pound" (Lb is $90, so OK next time...)

Some other time, I go ask for Jamon Iberico, the same guy says loudly "But you know that it costs $90 dollars a pound". I guess I don't look like I can afford that, OK...

Third time is an old woman clerk (Or owner?), I go ask again for Jamon Iberico, as she is cutting it, she asks me if I am from Spain, I said no, from Mexico, and as I am leaving she starts singing in low voice that I can still hear.. "Let's build a wall, and keep them out"...

OK, I will take my business somewhere else.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808f7e149bf992eb:0x9561ea86ac132f5e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Cheery is BS. After paying to park and walking into their wide open front door, a lady bluntly said “we’re closed.” And I said, “10 minutes early??” She snidely repeated “we’re closed” to which I said, “wow.”  Crappy attitude and a real let down to my nice day in the city. People like that just ruin the goodness of an otherwise great city.<//Review>< Pictures>

She then proceeds to act exasperated over the offense of me entering by throwing her hands up in the air. If you want to close five minutes early, that's fine, but don't be pissy about it and make a scene over nothing. Your front sign says "OPEN," your lights are on, doors unlocked, and other people are inside. I live in this neighborhood and will not give them my business again.

Have walked by this place a million times and always see people inside trying cheese and finally decided to go in this weekend.  There is a large selection of not just cheese, but meats, olive oils, wines and chocolates.  I purchased some Halva which is a sweet treat, reasonably priced and the staff was very friendly.</text>

When I called to ask whether they had vacherin (I wanted to make a fondue), they surprised me by asking whether I wanted vacherin Fribourgeois or vacherin Mont d'Or! I didn't even know I had a choice (FYI, the first one is the one you use for fondue). All other places I tried didn't have that kind of cheese.

<Text>(Translated by Google) The waitress is nice and she has the favorite cheese, Appenzeller. It's hard to find.

Ribs were out of this world! Dry rubbed, but perfectly moist and incredibly seasoned. They were huge ribs, too! Four ribs and the the sauteed potatoes had me full. Any drivers looking for some good food should drop by!<//review>

Good Mexican and American basic meat and potatoes. Good vegetarian choices. Great meals for truckers their main clientele. Be careful asking for everything on a burrito, the salsa is 100% octane and very spicy. Better than any allergy pill I've ever taken. Food portions, good food, ask about the salsa or sauce before ordering.< /Text>

< Review>
I prefer leaner cuts than the Roadhouse serves. A few pieces were more fat than lean. I'm not Jack Sprat but then again, I'm not his wife either.<//Review>

If all you ppl around here THINK that this is BBQ ppppppffffff. Obviously you never had real Texas BBQ now that is BBQ. The ribs we're dry with some kinda seasoning(if you can call it seasoning ) the bread was a lot better! ! If you're ever in go to Lockhart, TX. Where real BBQ comes from. Keep trying!< /review>

<Review>Save your money if you want relaxation and respectful people. You will not find it here. The place has become a hangout for hipsters and entitled millennials. We recently cancelled for this reason and others stated below .
1 - Big decline in member quality in 2019.
New members do not respect private space
of others.
2 - Newer members have turned club into a personal space for themselves. Last Thursday three people on phone in hot tub area. Signs clearly state NO CELL PHONES.
3 - Members treat hot tub/pool area as party zone. Loud conversations, sales pitches, pick up lines, music on cell phones etc. are the norm now.
4 - If you're looking for solitude and relaxation in hot tub, forget it. Staff does not police club rules or posted signs. People simply ignore the rules as if it were there own house.
5 - We paid almost $300 per month for a higher level of clientele.That has has changed dramatically this year. Wife and I no longer look forward to being around our own social class of people.
We are DONE with this place...< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1564423681895, 'text': "Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review, Wes. I'm sorry to hear that you and your wife are no longer members at the club. I can understand the reasoning behind some of the issues you discussed and will certainly take steps to ensure that our members follow the posted rules, but with that said, we support our overall member community regardless of age or social status.\n\nWith regards to your experience in our outdoor hot tub, while we cannot speak to the conversations that are being held, we encourage members not to bring their phones near the water more so for their own device's safety; members are free to use their device as long as it is not disruptive. For a quieter, more relaxing experience, we do offer an indoor hot tub, steam room, and sauna in both the men's and women's locker rooms. Cell phones are strictly forbidden from being used in the locker rooms for the privacy of members.\n\nOnce again, I truly appreciate your feedback as it allows us to improve. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly if you have further questions or concerns that I can address with you.\n\nKindly,\nEric Geeb\nGeneral Manager"}< /response><GmapID>0x80e914771f7bce93:0x6c9422b52628cefa<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

SWELL Santa Barbara Athletic Club is not so SWELL!
As many of us do, I was really excited about joining a Gym and starting a new health program for myself. Based on a friend’s recommendation I went to the Santa Barbara athletic club.  Wow!!! I can’t begin to express the treatment I got!  Excuse me????? Are the workout machines in this place made of gold?  Or is the bad attitude by the employees a “we only like certain people here” a filter! Either way stay away!  You’ll be spared the embarrassment! My opinion:
un-available to return calls.  Could care less about new members!  Snudi and self absorbed! Very uncomfortable atmosphere! In the end just another sweaty gym with a big ticket price and a bad attitude!<//Text>

My husband and I just bought a house in Montecito and wanted to get our in-town gym lined up. We've had memberships to other private clubs everywhere we've lived, and wanted to see if SWELL was as good as some of our local friends said it was. We've learned to always ask current members what their experience is, and try out a week or so before buying a membership....mostly so that we don't get a membership and then constantly complain about it. We signed up separately and staggered our 3-day passes, to test the water of how the staff treated us, and if their sales pitches were different. Our overall experience was a mixed bag:

-Whoever is in charge of the pool chemicals is doing an excellent job--not overly chlorinated and no hair, bandaids, etc. floating around. We politely asked to share lanes with swimmers of similar speed, but there seemed to be a dramatic edge about territory that we're not accustomed to. We're used to masters swimmers who know how to shared lanes. It wasn't enough of an issue to annoy us, because we'll probably open water swim join local masters, anyway.
-We sat by the pool all 3 days we worked out, and were sandwiched in between a group of loud millennials playing music on their phones who said they weren't members but were just using the free 3-day pass to sit by the pool during a hot weekend...and several long time members who complained for a half hour about how a third of the lounge chairs had been missing for over a month, but not replaced yet by Scott. It indicated to us that the quality of the members is probably in decline--and the long time members are annoyed about it, and the non-members/new members are clueless about private club etiquette. I don't envy the drama management must have to put up at this time.
-Despite anti-harassment statements on the front of the pool locker room doors, I got hit on by two drunk guys in the hot tub who had their pitcher of beer sitting on the edge of the deck. Full on comments about my bikini before I even got settled in. Neither were members. That didn't happen when my husband was around...it's 2019, so no surprise there. Just wish that staff would cruise through once in a while and make sure that beer isn't on the edge of the pool, or guys getting drunk, or loud music playing, or towels laying all over the place.
-The front desk staff seemed to be generally stressed out, overworked, and annoyed at being asked to help with locker issues, juice bar requests, and membership questions. IMO, that annoyance seeped over to how members vs. non-members were treated.
-The biggest draw for us was the sheer number of equipment areas. We didn't have to wait for weight benches, machines, or padded spaces for basics like lunges. We could work out barefoot in some areas. The outdoor equipment over the pool is fantastic. The olympic lifting area was a huge plus for my husband, and plenty of TRX zones were great.
-I got zero sales pitches during or after the 3-day trial, but my husband received several.
-Several members we spoke to said they had been members for 10+ years but were increasingly annoyed about membership over the last year or so (decline in quality of people and a high turn over in staff).

We liked the fitness areas an amenities, but we'll probably wait for a year or so and see if the overall moral and cleanliness of locker rooms improves before we buy a membership. The Goleta location is too much out of our way for a daily trek.< /review>

Some of the classes at the club cost members more money and it already is costly to be a member.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I've been a member over twenty years, joined when it was only $70 a month.  I've tried to leave, joining the Y twice, but always return, though it's more than doubled in price.  Why?  Because it's CLEAN and there are no children running around.  I was furious when they compromised the pool by building the spinning room right over it, blocking the best sunlight, but I haven't found better in SB.< /Review>< Pictures>

Outside has beautiful setting.  Other than that, just a average gym with an superiority complex.  If you are not a member who
participates in the upsells that are pushed, you are viewed as a 2nd class citizen.   Ironic that their motto is:  "You can join another gym, but you belong here" Not true. Management thinks members should be grateful just to pay their high dues and just keep quiet.<//Text>

Add pricing to your website or have someone who can quote membership pricing available when I call.

It's really annoying first not find what I was looking for on the website and then to call and not be able to speak to someone who can assist with something as simple as cost.<//Text>

Rude , sexist , and patroniziig.I am in the process of contacting the owners of this club, For years I was member, then I began to visit. The staff has no knowledge of the sytem and how to check people in, the service is terrible and high turnover of staff. Probably because of the abusive management.  Terrible food service , they complain and always are understaffed and / or "closed" . But without a doubt , the management team is rude and dismissive. In fact they are almost never there ( Jeremy) Matt and Chad are less than involved .the equipment is mediocre. Over all run down. Dirty, they never clean the matts or machines. _ heath hazard The spa smells like scum. The management team treated me like a "small woman".  Ran by mem and degradiing men at that Telling me that I ws not a memeber and  refusing to give me a corporarate email for complaints This is what to expect behind closed door not  upscale as they prpomote themdselves. Quite honestly iI don;t know how they can get away treating people this way, when if fact they are not involved , lack of integrity and could care less about anyone who s not paying. I wa sconsidering becoming a member again , until this most resent reflection. I am making it my mission now to let others know the truth.
Jeramy is never there, yet calls himself a manager . He refused to information, and hung up on me.  I will be contacting the owner. I would not recommend this treatment to anyone. They are totally unptofessioinal and dismissive

I will say that many of the instructors are very nice and very good at their skill. I would have become a member again ( as was considering ) until this shocking issue today. I am letting my member friends know about this, they will not be happy about this experience.

Chad and Jeremy work together and are not effective -- scary to see people like this run someones business. This only gym with a pool, and probably the on reason people stay. BECAUSE ITS N OT THE DECLINE OF quality personel or managenemt. If I was the owner I would really take a look as this as a HUGE RED FLAG. How many other re and have been disciminated against, patronized at treated like crap. I am shocked at the behavior.< /text>

The process to order and the delivery was swift and easy. The option to pay online made this so! The delivery guy, Bartholomew, was cool too. The hand off was quick and easy. I will continue ordering from Mountain Remedy.< /Text>

They have always had very friendly and helpful customer service over the years ordering from them and I would highly recommend this delivery service to all my friends! Shout-out to Hariah H, she was is always super welcoming and friendly on her deliveries and just makes the experience feel that much more unique vs other places< /review></record>

<Text>Jessica C was one of the best delivery people that I’ve acquainted with! She was very prompt and kept me updated. When she arrived she had such a good energy and brought a smile to my face.

I always order from here and love it. Yesterday, my order arrived way ahead of schedule thanks to Yassi - what a sweetheart!! She also waited for me to get my money and other stuff together for like 20 mins. There are several dispensaries closer to where I live but thanks to the customer service I'll continue only purchasing from here.< /Text>

< Review>
Rocio is a star!!!!I 🐶 She always asks about my puppy she has met on several occasions. I mean really folks, sweet and efficient is the way I would describe my experiences with her and Mountain Remedy. She also makes sure I check my order to prevent any issues around wrong product without having to return for follow up. Mountain Remedy is my number 1 supplier of thc products. Being a members pays in the form of Cannacash you can apply towards purchases. I tend to try and wait for their specials to really stock up at a significant discount. They always deliver in the time frame stated and they use Onfleet so you are notified in advance of where your driver is as you get close to the delivery.<//Review>

<Review>Gabe in dispatch was so personable and knew his products well. Felt very content with the answers to all my questions and even got him to laugh. Ken, the driver who dropped my order was sincere and personable. He took customer service to another level and I felt I was well taken care of. I hope he did too.< /Review>< Resp>

David made a delivery to me on March 9th, 2021.
This guy was BEYOND AMAZING!!! 😋
He waited patiently in his car because I wasn’t ready, and THEN he sat and listened to me complain about my day! Poor guy...
David is a kind and friendly individual. Thanks so much, 🌺</Text>

All their reps are soo helpful, but Mayra really made it easy. Such a smooth transaction. Their drivers are wonderful, the delivery time is fast, and occasionally they throw in a special "extra" that I TRULY appreciate. Thanks Mountain Remedy and thank you Mayra!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Mountain Remedy is among the quickest, friendliest, most professional and knowledgeable in the industry.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.

I've been ordering from them for years now and the quality has never wavered.

My most recently delivery driver Stephanie was super nice!  Which is common from their drivers and staff.

My #1 choice for sure ⛰⛑< /text>

<Text>Absolutely love this service! Great selection of product and the customer service is beyond excellent. Today a woman named Kate helped me with some questions I had regarding my order, she was so helpful and nice! She went above and beyond to help me and answer all my questions. Def recommend mountain remedy!

I'm adding to my original review just to say that the delivery guy James, is awesome! He is very professional and polite. Everytime I see him it's always a pleasure :) Thanks James!<//Text><user>116404790488067483384< /user>< Pics>

My last order unfortunately had a defect. During my next order I made Jess aware of the defect. She was very appreciative of my honesty and the way she communicated with me was very impressive. I didn’t even ask for something to repair the damages, she offered.  I’ve used mountain remedy, and only mountain remedy, for a couple years and will continue to partner with them as my exclusive provider. Really great to work with an organization that appreciates constructive feedback!<//Review>

<Review>I have had nothing but good experiences with this place. I don't usually leave reviews but I've been using Mountain Remedy for about two years through two addresses and have never had a mistake with my order. My last two drivers Boris and Mayra were amazing because my apartment is super hard to find and they were able to find it without even texting me. Plus they were super chill people. They have no delivery fee and their minimum is 40 which is much nicer than the 100 dollar minimum at other places. I've tried other places around the bay and they just aren't as good.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Amazing experience from start to finish. I haven’t tried any of the product yet but the customer experience.... yooooo my main plug is gonna get cut real soon if he doesn’t step his game up. 😂 The wonderful person, ( I can’t for the life of me remember her name, I’ve taken one too many punches to the head 🥴), who took my order was patient, helpful, super sweet, and had a great sense of humor. I didn’t catch the other wonderful person who delivered my prefer but man that was the cherry on top! She was awesome too! Not awkward at all, super polite, and really sweet as well! I’ll be coming back for all my 420 needs, made a loyal customer out of me. Thank you again!<//Review>

Gabriel‘s phone manner and recommendations could not have been better, but that’s no surprise given the extraordinarily high level of customer service with Mountain Remedy.

There was a little confusion at delivery time about the quoted price, but  the charming and effervescent delivery woman, Aja, straightened it out quickly with a terrific attitude.<//Review>

First time I ordered from this place was back in July, I was feeling a lot of stress and anxiety at work. With Covid and trying to get back to life, I thought.. I really need to smoke lol. Being at work, I couldn’t leave to pickup a cart, but I came across Mountain Remedy nearby and thought I’d shoot a text over to get info on their delivery services. I was pretty surprised by the quick response, literally within minutes. Nick told me about the website and I can check out the menu on there and just let him know what I wanted. He made it so easy and didn’t tell me I had to go through a million steps in order to place an order! Lol. I had it delivered to my work within an hour. That was the best part! I also DIDN’T have to pay with cash, which made it that much more convenient. I have literally been ordering from Mountain Remedy once a week or so for the past two months now. Nick you’re the best! Thank you for all of your help and assistance and for being professional and polite! You and the team are very much appreciated!! I don’t even bother going into dispensaries now because your services make it so much easier and convenient!! Thank you!! :)< /Review>

Driver:
David was a great driver who made sure to handle my Order. I received the wrong item and he made sure to call the office and fix the problem before leaving.

Mountain Remedy itself right now:
-I had a few occasions where my order was wrong, so it’s always good to double check.
-Also, I hope for a better way to pay. I liked how easy the older system they had was, at least along those lines. Or let the customers pay online or over the phone so we don’t need to stand outside. My complex doesn’t have a lot of parking so it’s better to be in and out easily and as fast as possible.
-Also, I think a scheduled time for Next Day delivery should be that time and not include the two hour wait. For example I set a time for 5pm and the time for next day is 5pm-7pm, I feel like I’m waiting around for a cable guy to show up lol

Anyways, I hope this is just because of some “transition” issues. Other than that, I used to love MR! I hope you guys can get back on track :)</review>

I wanted to add today my service was from Erica.  She was friendly, knowledgeable and got my order handled quickly and accurately.  The driver Marz was professional and delivered my items safely.  Again, I "highly" recommend.  So awesome. I wanted some product and it arrived with in 40 minutes. Karielle the delivery person was safe, professional and friendly. I would “highly” recommend to everyone.<//text>

Always cool and timely. Lots to choose from. My driver Stephanie was very polite and maintained a safe distance I felt comfortable with. So far the process was easy and I didn’t have to do much. They sent a link to join as a member and that was beyond easy. Looking forward to using them in the future.<//text>

I love Mountain Remedy! They’re my preferred delivery service. I honestly don’t order from other places anymore. Staff is always friendly, helpful and extremely efficient! I also love how tax is already included in their pricing. They make ordering very convenient! Shout out to Iris, Kyle, Karielle and the rest of the staff. Thank you for all you do! <3</Text>

Great, prompt, professional service. On-time, cheerful, friendly drivers like David, who deliver quality products, can be tracked for convenience and all at fair prices.

Tonight’s driver was Mayra. She’s the best! Fast courteous service, a great representative for a great delivery service. Thanks Mayra.</Review>

<review>Kyle gave me outstanding service from the moment we first spoke until my product was delivered. He was able to assure me “same day” delivery when my initial order came in right on the mark. As a first time guest, I appreciated every aspect of my experience with Mountain Remedy. Stop here now with your search and call Kyle now!!

p.s. the products are excellent!!<//review>< Pics>

<text>I’ve ordered like 5 times from this place already. They usually always arrive a little bit earlier than their given ETA which is great. I can’t complain about anything really.

<text>I have absolutely nothing negative to say about Mountain Remedy. I always place orders on line, always without glitches. Sometimes it seems to take a long time for the delivery to get to me but I just figure they are very busy or I'm ordering at a time they are likely to have minimum staff working.

How can I complain? They deliver cannabis, legally, to my door!! All the drivers are cool. No matter how antsy or irritated I may get while waiting, the sight of the car pulling up makes all that disappear.</text>< GmapID>

Mountain Remedy is fantastic!  The drivers are prompt and friendly.  Anytime I've had a question about stock or dosage, I'm able to call and receive excellent and personable customer service (Kate helped me last time.  She's awesome!).   This is, hands down, the best delivery service in the bay area (...and I've tried a number of them).  Keep it up!<//text>

Just happened today.... I normally use 3 times a week for delivery.... Today get a delivery as normal, $105 plus tip .... normally they text updates, today I only received an initial text and 1 as the driver was 3 mins away.... apparently my order had been discounted to $65 that I was unaware of, and later only found in my emails but had no text, which normally is not how we communicate.... so the driver either left with $111 for a $65 bill as if $50 tips were normal and said nothing, or they are all scamming people using the customers accumulated points for discounts without their knowledge and pocketing the difference..... all they did was give me a $40 credit, which makes up for nothing because they used MY points to discount it anyway... so im still out $40..... im going to use them 1 more time and im done with them.... they just lost ALOT of business</text><userid>115840021445142231845</userid><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

I had a very good experience from start to finish. I was actually further than what they delievered too but we worked out a location. Aunti was so chill and helpful. I even ended up being late and Aunti still worked it out for me so I had did not have to wait long even though the error was mine. How business should be!</Review>

Someday I’ll write a song about Mountain Remedy! Their friendly professional staff is always available to answer questions and make recommendations. I’m new to the area and I already feel like I have friends in the neighborhood at Mountain Remedy! The drivers are always on time. I know who’s coming and when . Even though they’re all the best, I do have favorites (that will remain my secret). The prices are more than affordable and the punch card rewards my loyalty. Thank you Mountain Remedy!!< /review>

Mountain REMEDY is without a doubt,  the best delivery dispensary for your medicinal or recreational needs.  They are very professional, organized and more than willing to help the customer in any way possible. It was a breeze from the initial phone call to front door delivery. It couldn't be any easier. It almost seems unreal. They allow you to track your package in real time. If you give them a try, there is no way you will be disappointed. Their hours are truly accommodating and their prices are extremely competitive with others. No need to keep searching for dependable, consistent and professional service -MOUNTAIN REMEDY is here.</review>

<review>This company is not in Walnut Creek- false advertising. Don’t try claim you’re based in Walnut Creek if you’re not just so you can get the $$$$. Took longer than it should have if it was in Walnut Creek.
Also, the people I spoke to on the phone were super out of it (probably stoned) and rude. My first time purchasing from them and I had a few questions, (which should be reasonable), but they acted irritated and impatient. Not fun.< /review>< Pics>

No cannabis business is located in Walnut Creek as per city ordinance does not allow for licensing within their city limits.  Currently the closest to Walnut Creek a cannabis company can get a license and location to operate their business is Oakland, where we are based.  Walnut Creek is in our delivery zone and we do everything in our power, pending bay area traffic and influx of orders, to get to our customers as fast as possible.  The safety regulations the state of California has in place for delivery services makes accommodating on demand deliveries a challenge, but we always do our best to get our customers what they want quickly!  Company policy and state regulations also prevents anyone on duty in the cannabis industry to be consuming any cannabis product as well, but we never want anyone to feel like they cannot call us and have their questions answered in a polite and friendly manner.

This is by far the best delivery service I’ve ever gone through and the best customer service I’ve received. I pride myself in being genuine and honest in my life and with my reviews! I am not joking when I say they truly do try to accommodate all your needs with total care And thoughtfulness in mind. Ive been a loyal and long time customer and even when I’m having the worst anxiety ridden days and calling in practically crying if not literally some days and all of the dispatchers have alway been so sweet understanding non judgmental and absolutely helpful as heck and getting me to feel better ASAP. Thank you so much to mountain remedy and today especially Carissa for making it so I didn’t have to have a anxiety attack driving to Berkeley. She’s always been wonderful and today she really saved me. To the Owner...you must be a great Boss because all your employees are so fantastic!!!! I very much appreciate mountain remedy.</text>

<review>My first time experience was absolutely amazing! Alec whom I spoke to on the phone went above and beyond! His customer service was phenomenal, very polite and called me back to let me know the driver was slightly delayed. The driver was very nice. My overall experience was so good enough I’m definitely going back for more!!!!! Very nice people and great products! I’m very very satisfied. Again more recognition for Alec!!! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Fantastic, quality cannabis products at affordable prices. From edibles to tinctures. Flower to cartridges. And a wide array of cbd products. They deliver it right to your door with a smile and have a great rewards + referral program. Be sure to tip your drivers! Will be ordering regularly and telling all my friends.< /text>

I’m new to the area and my usual place in Berkeley. I’m currently having anxiety and really needed some relief. Search online and found this place which was closing in an hour I didn’t think I ordered in time but the time I walked up to my apartment I got an alert saying it’s 7 minutes away!!!! Fastest service ever!!!!! Will most definitely use again! Y’all saved me tonight!! Thank you Thank you 🙏🏾<//Review>

< Review>
Had a little hiccup with one of the edibles that were delivered to me from Mountain Remedy— wasn’t really expecting anything to be done about it, but to my pleasant surprise, Mountain Remedy was willing to offer an exchange without any extra cost to me. Alec was extremely helpful throughout the entire process and made me really feel like he was looking out for me as a customer, and really help me. It was super appreciated. Definitely going to keep ordering from Mountain Remedy from here on out. Awesome job, Alec, and thank you!</Review>

<text>Been ordering with Mountain for a little while, and they’ve always had exceptional service. When I text to order they’re so nice and always give great suggestions when I ask; it makes ordering so easy. And my orders always come within 30 minutes or less. They even have no issue on sending you out a new order if you don’t like something about your product, and it’s quickly too! Beyond the easy ordering process the drivers are always nice and friendly and in the best moods; it adds to why I love ordering with Mountain Remedy!

<Text>My review of this place on Leafly disappeared.  Leafly has turned out to be just as dishonest as Weedmaps, so they have lost my business, as well.  All the ratings dispensaries get on these websites are fake and by design, so DO NOT USE WEEDMAPS AND LEAFLY.  If a dispensary gets a bad review, they simply delete the review.

Mountain Remedy fell off the deep end.  I was a long and loyal customer, and they have become inconsistent and a drag to deal with, so I'm done with them.  The quality of bud is too often sad for the price, the employees are reluctant to help when you call with an issue, and they don't follow through on what they say.  Don't tell me the manager will contact me when he actually won't.  Filthy liars.  If I didn't have my full rewards card to use for a free eighth, I wouldn't even have done business with this place that last time.  They've lost a lot of money because of how substandard they've become.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Poor customer service and lack of effective scheduling has belittled me to writing a negative review.
Disclaimer: I don’t know what this establishment is like on good days when they are fully staffed, nor do I know about the quality and variety of their products.
I do, however, know that they have extremely long delivery waits, and failed to inform me of a proper ETA until I called an hour after I placed my order to be told it would take another two hours.
I’ve never waited more that 30 minutes for a delivery.
Hope they get more staffed, otherwise the receptionists seemed very friendly.<//Review>

<text>So if you don’t have WeedMaps and haven’t read my review on this place I suggest going there first, or going straight to Mounatin Remedy’s website.
Now if you’re jus browsing and trying to figure out which cannabis delivery service to use, or maybe you’re a newcomer and need some guidance. Let me preface this with a little disclaimer: I am not paid by this place. Anything opinions I have are my own. Now let me say, what a place. Again if you’re a new one to the cannabis scene, these are the people to talk to. They can explain everything you may need to know. Along with that, they carry an amazing line of products, from flower (cannabis buds), to vapes, to dabs, edibles, creams, these folks have it. They have a knowledge staff, along with a top notch delivery team, add being able to take a credit, or debit card (cash is always an option) with discreet delivery, and CA approved products. As far as prices are concerned , they offer an incredibly competitive price range. From $35 18ths to your more high end exotic strains and oils, you’re likely to find something worth the money you spent.< /text>< pictures>

Very good buds, great service to say the least, order came with a pre roll of some indica to match my initial indica order, Devil’s Lettuce to be exact, great product, the driver Rubin was also very timely and even showed up sooner than the tracker updates had expected, which was awesome for me since this was a much needed delivery for the 21st Bday. Would definitely recommend this spot to all the homies, 510 /415/ 707/916 anyone sliding through the 925 should find themselves impressed if on the search for quality dank and good customer service.</text>

Gmo cookie was instock and priced right.
Aka garlic cookies can be htf especially at this price and its organic which is a plus.
Also got cream brule which can also be htf.
Overall both are excellent and will be reordering my gmo (my fav) and cant wait to try the 2 chainz strain "gas 89 - sour gas" i haven't seen this offered anywhere else before now.
You can use cards for 3.00 fee, i got a 10.00 discount for getting 2 eighths, rewards card, quick delivery mine was 20 min to oakland.
No complaints because i would if there was...believe that!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>I have used Mountain Remedy a few times now and I have decided I wont be trying any other deliveries. If it isnt broken dont try and fix it! This place has it all and at a very nice and fast delivery pace. They are so nice and helpful on the phone and in person. Everything is so legit and makes me feel comfertable. Great products with all info you need and pictures before you purchase anything. They do well with prices and the more u buy they seem to add disscounts and you get some free stuff ur first purchase.
