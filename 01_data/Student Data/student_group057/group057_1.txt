<review>Be very careful with this business. Last year I took my jet ski to be repaired and do an oil change.  I asked the 2 owners of the business to make sure they test the jet ski in the water.  I got the jet ski back and took it to the Lake which it took in water and flooded the engine. I called each owner of the business on 2 separate occasion's and asked if they tested my jet ski in the water and both of them had 2 different stories. I had a friend look at my jecky and he was able to fix it with in a 1/2 hour by screwing down a bolt by the impeller. In the jet ski repair business you have to have integrity since the customer is trusting the business to do what they say they are going to do. In my opinion this business does not have the integrity that I am looking for. So take your time and go to a business that you can trust.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>
{'time': 1590554009118, 'text': 'Hello, sorry you had a negative experience with our shop.  Seems odd that you’d wait a year to write a review without at least reaching out to us to give us a chance to fix any issue that could have been our fault.  Water test would have been reflected on your invoice as such if that’s what was requested and done.  Is the screw by the impeller the drain plug maybe?  We fix 100’s of PWC a year, we’re far from perfect but always try to correct a problem if it’s something that we did wrong.   Service with oil changes don’t typically require any work down by the impeller so this one has me a little confused.   We have many repeat customers and a lot of our work comes as referrals.   Hope your ski is working well, take care. -Ronnie D.'}<//response>

<review>Quick and efficient service. Yuba City Harley Davidson wanted nearly 70 bucks just to balance my rear tire yet these guys took my old one off and put another one I had purchased elsewhere and balanced it for 39. I'm recommending these guys to those that ride like me all weather and not get ripped off by a lousy dealership.<//review>< Pictures>

Crooks! Destroyed our cart. Left it in parts, buried it in trash, left it in pieces. Kept making excuses why it was not done. If they did not want to fix it at least they could have told us to come get it. I wish there was a no star option.< /Text>

I took my jet ski to a different guy before hearing about D D Motorsports.  It sat there for literally 1 month and never got fixed.  I brought it here and told Bill I needed it for a family vacation in a week.  I was asking a lot especially during the heart of jet ski season.  Bill had it fixed in 6 days and it is running perfect! This guy knows what he's doing. Even though I live in Chico, I'll bring all my stuff here in the future!  Highly recommend!< /review>

Bought my first bike there and I couldn't be happier with the experience. The staff there is very knowledgeable and they are riders and know their stuff. They have new and used sport bikes, quads ,jet skis, dirt bikes, dual purpose, gear and helmets, not to mention a full repair shop. They had it all to get me started.</Text>

I brought my 2001 CBR929RR in to the shop for a full rebuild. New plastics, fork seals, chain, wheel bearings, valve adjustment, and electrical work. They were upfront about the wait time and possible costs. The kicker was half the bike was in a box. Tom the mechanic assigned to the job used to have a 929RR and really did a great job putting it back together and getting it loud and fast again. I would definitely recommend them due to the fact that they did everything the right way. They could have cut corners on certain things, but they ordered the missing parts and sorted out some problems. The only down fall was how anxious I was to get the bike back after I stopped by the shop to drop off some parts and check out the progress. They came in way under my budget and didn't try to nickel and dime me. For as long as I'm in the area they get my business. Again, much appreciated guys!</Review>

I have nothing but excellent things to say about this shop. I have a smaller race boat and not everyone will take it in. They took it in, gave me a GREAT price and had me back on the water within a couple of hours. Not too many shops like that around still.

If you want an honest "mom and pops" type shop then come here</Review>

Very poor customer service. No communication at all. They knew I was in a time restricted situation. Still not one phone call from them. The only time I got anything from them was when I left work and stopped in to ask them. Then the owner was still not there. They told me he was busy. If they keep this up he will not have to worry about being busy. The only help was from the employee who helped unload and load my quad. Still runs like crap, ran better before I took it in. Go somewhere else.<//review>

<review>They have great customer service. Fair labor rates. The mechanics that work at this shop are extremely knowledgeable they charged me less than they quoted me for and had my motor rebuilt and put back together sooner than I expected.< /review><GmapID>0x809b530cc6636f09:0xfde246642a75a752< /GmapID>< date>

<text>Poor customer service; I went in to ask a simple question about pricing. The person working the desk received a phone call and got up and walked away. It would have not bothered me so much if he would of been courteous and told me "hold on, I have to take this" or "sorry give me a minute" he just go up and walked away. I waited roughly 15-20 mins (as I looked around the shop) as he kept his back to me. I then shouted to see if anyone in the garage can give me a price estimate, and he shook his head no. He finally got off of the phone, still zero acknowledgement. Over hearing his conversation I was able to put together that he was dealing with a different customer complaint which bothered him; at that moment I knew this was not the place for me. His attitude after the fact was one as if I was wasting his time. The estimate was pricey, customer service ugly; I'm new to this area and was looking for a go-to shop for my motorcycles.

Although the place next door Morris Cycle Supply (MCS) did not have a tire changing machine at the time, the owner's attitude and customer service was a 5 star rating. I will be looking forward to bringing my business to them.

D&D please invest in some customer service training, I will be sure to not recommend your business to my folks on base. Very unfortunate</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I've been in the motorcycle service industry for 12 years and have never seen service as bad as this. I took my snowmobile in for a new pull start and a running issue because I was too busy to do it and wanted it done before the next weekend so I could ride it. I told them I thought the carbs needed to be cleaned because it had been sitting for about 2 years. Long story short they quoted me $400 to clean the carbs and another $100 to change the pull starter which takes all of about 10 minutes.(this didn't include the cost of the part) I declined and ended up having to pay them $85 "diagnostic fee" just to repeat to me what I told them when I dropped it off. I've been around the industry long enough to know you don't nickel and dime people and that's exactly what this place will do.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I've been a customer for a few years now. I have taken my family's quads, and wave runner for service. I know my family is very hard on our toys. I am not the best at taking care of them. The guys at D&D have always taken care of our stuff and the prices have always been fair. On one occasion, I came in with a problem with my Wave runner, which I came in knowing full well I caused it. It was only a few weeks after it had been serviced. They fixed the issue and refused to let me pay for the minor repair. I will always be a customer of D&D.</Text><gmap_id>0x809b530cc6636f09:0xfde246642a75a752</gmap_id><username>Chad Rishel</username><Resp>None< /Resp><Rate>5</Rate><time>1460955183711< /time><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

< Review>
Was passing thru town with a big group of bikes and toy haulers and got a flat tire on my Harley about a block away.  Pushed the bike to the shop only to find they didn't have the tire I needed on the shelf.  One of the service techs John said he had a tire out back that he was just getting ready to put on his Harley for the big weekend but instead sold me the tire.  They put a rush on the job and had me out and back on the road in about a hour.  I'm not from marysville but if I was this would be my shop.  They go above and beyond to make customers happy.  Thanks for saving my weekend D&D!< /Review>

Horrible service.  Had our superchargers replaced on our jet skies.  Used them maybe 3 times then parked them for two years.  We moved and had them serviced somewhere else where they said on one of the skies, the supercharger wasn't screwed down and had rattled around inside and was destroyed.  Called D&D, they said that they have never had anything like that happen (despite the other review of a similar problem) and had a very bad attitude on the phone and criticized the techs in Sacramento for ripping us off (even though I have the damaged part).  I understand that after two years they wouldn't probably be able to do anything for us, but it just is frustrating that we paid to have our supercharger replaced twice and have used our skis a handful of times.  Expensive mistake they cost us!</text>

I went in Looking for parts for my bike and wrecking at local track ( Fish MX ) and nobody had locally. I had a race in a hour and **** out of Luck. Bill working on a Saturday saved the day! He let me take parts off his 2012 KTM 250 SXF to fix bike and was so impressed he let me take parts off a bike on showroom that was for sale and basically made it unsalable until he ordered new parts. Bill was a life saver!< /review>

< Review>
DO NOT BUY A BIKE FROM THESE GUYS!!

I paid my bike off in January,  here it is September. 9 months later !! Still no pink slip. Contacted DMV Investigations.  They stated this place has had numerous complaints regarding same issue!

I've contacted Bill Davis numerous times before I went this direction.    I called on May 15th 2015, he stated it was put in the wrong spot some done file and wasn't processed. he stated I would receive pink slip in 10 days or less.
Called again on June 9th 2015. The guy said bill wasn't in. So I called back with a blocked number and Bill answered . Same story he forgot to process it. He assured me he was sorry and he would take care of it personally.

Called back on July 9th. Same run around. Finally said forget it and waited. Had bike ran through dmv and law enforcement systems bike still not registered to us... finally got fed up and now DMV Investigations had to handle situation.  I hope they investigate the crap out of this.  A business shouldn't be able to survive doing business like this!! Shady as Hell!!

NEVER AGAIN!!!< /Review>

Wow blew my mind just called to see what the financing would be on a street bike. What happened to rock bottom prices lol. Half down and high monthly payments no wonder they will finance anybody.<//review>

{'time': 1590554599373, 'text': 'That’s how our in house financing works if you can’t get credit through other lenders.  1/2 down and the balance paid over 6 months.  We’re one of the only shops you’ll find with a in house financing with no credit checks.    That being said, that has nothing to do with our prices...   Sorry you have trouble understanding.

Their unique recipe for each of their donuts is Amazing. There is no way, we can't stop in our way to San Diego.
My family and I are always looking forward to have them. If one, stops earlier in the morning, you will see the small group of people from the community drinking coffee and chatting. Everyone have their own cup hanging from the cup coffee holder.< /Review>< pictures>

This is probably the only donut shop I will go too. Only because their donuts are always made fresh and the service is quick. They have a big selection of donuts and they also offer breakfast sandwiches or croissant. MAKE SURE YOU BRING ONLY CASH THEY DO NOT ACCEPT CARD.< /review>

<Text>Purchased 3 dozen pastries picked up at 7am expecting fresh and warm for trip.  The donuts texture appeared about 2 days old, the cinnamon rolls had little cinnamon, no raisins or nuts were large flattish things none would eat and the bear claws did not look like any I had ever seen and were filled with an apple sauce that was so sweet it seemed to have come from a can.  Not like what I picked up a couple of years back when traveling through.< /Text><UserId.>107818791152819260827<//UserId.>< date>

The French cruller was awesome - plenty moist. The croissant sandwich was also delicious. The other donut waskind of dry, unfortunately. Also, they only accept cash. If still go back though if in the area again.< /Text>

This place has been around since I was a kid. They make great doughnuts, strudels, cream puffs and a whole variety of delicious treats. They are also open until 9pm, because you never know when you're going to NEED that late night pastry.< /text>

<text>Cash only. The doughnuts here are always fresh and delicious. My wife enjoys the cinnamon twist, and I like the bear claw. The doughnut holes here are decently priced and addicting. I was waiting on some fresh doughnuts and ordered the holes while I wait. I ended up ordering 2 more cups for when I get home. Service here is pretty consistent and I dont have any complaints. Plus I love to support the little guy.</text></record>

Always enjoy Rubio's. Their plates can be creative and all of their food has that "fresh" feel. The shrimp bowl could use a little more shrimp, but still hit the spot as their food usually does.< /text>

<Text>One thing that I can say about Rubio's and probably not many people know is that they have real keto friendly options this being the keto shells they use with any Taco you want.

The Keto shell is basically a grilled cheese Circle that is used as a tortilla and it's really crunchy and adds lots of flavor to the different fish or shrimp proteins available.<//Text>< pictures>

I ordered delivery from Rubio's through the doordash app. As expected, our doordash driver was amazing. Our food was picked up and delivered to us immediately (about 3 blocks away).
Unfortunately the restaurant was not so amazing.
The salad I received was full of old, brown, wilted lettuce which turned out to make up about half of the entire salad.
the tacos were edible, though cold and full of small bits of seafood shell.</text>

Most disgusting experience I've ever had at a Rubio's anywhere. Sure, the food was fine and the service from the person taking my order was great, but it was all ruined by the sound of someone back in the kitchen constantly hocking loogies or clearing his sinuses or something. Over and over again the entire time I was eating. Very unpleasant to think about them being back by the food preparation area. I could see a few other customers giving their orders second thoughts as well. Whoever was in charge of the team at that time should've done something. Very disappointing.< /Text>

Really nice day in Sf, and we wanted to grab some small bites and drinks.
We got seats at the bar right away, and were served quickly. Good views.
We got the fried calamari, sliders, and crab cakes. So good! This place is super touristy, but I would come back if I was in the area again.< /text>

Google clearly said it is open till 9pm. I drove 10 miles and kissed closed doors. On their doors it is said they close at 8:30pm today, but at 8:25pm they were already closed. They screwed up twice. Nice!< /text>

With the amount of noise, you can get away with a bit noisier than normal, but it gives off a cozy feel. They are also immensely polite, refusing to hand you your food but placing it down in front of you personally. The only down side would be the wait-- so don't forget to reserve ahead of time.<//review>< userid>

<Review>I was really disappointed,  I ordered the 3 street tacos plate for about $9. The meat was dry and hard. For 9 doallrs the amount of food I got and the quality was sad. Sorry maybe just a bad day. But i don't think i be back.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Time>1571953577317< /Time></record>

<Text>Rude, rude, rude.  I ordered online and went inside after the time they said my food would be ready.  I waited and waited, there was no one there to help me.  Someone finally approached to help and then she just threw my food on the counter, the bag fell over and she said "everything is in there" and walked away.  After I checked, everything was not in there!  The counter at the sauces and drinks was a mess, dirty, and wet.  Atmosphere = awful</Text>< Date>

The staff are so friendly and the food only takes the amount of time it takes you to choose your favorites from the salsa bar.

Taco Tuesdays can't be best. Where else can you get 1 big fish taco, a meal in itself for 1.75... 1.75!!!

The dining room always has seating and there is always room outside. Did I mention the friendly staff? Not to mention how clean they keep the tables. A great stop for lunch or dinner :-)<//Text>

Somehow the fish (mahi-mahi) burrito was lacking flavor, a little bit on the blend side. Had to use extra salsa and lime squeeze to bring flavor  out.
They shouldn't be afraid of a little garlic and butter.</Text>

The staff was kinda of rude. I ordered a chicken Quesadilla and it almost had no chicken in it at all. When I took it up they were giving me dirty looks and laughing. My friend got a street taco with less than six pieces of tiny chicken. Not the best location.<//text>

I go to Rubios for Lunch everyday and my fiancee and I get the same tbing all of the time so we know what to expect. This is the only location I have been at that did not give me a lot of meat in my burrito. Our Burrito consited of a lot of beans and ALOT of rice and not a lot of meat. Very disappointed because these burritos go for $10 plus for just rice and beans. I expect them to have the same quality food as other locations. Tables are also very sticky.<//review>

I love the food here at Rubio's. I usually go to the one in the Costa Mesa Courtyard or the one in Santa Ana at MacArthur and Fairview.
The only negative comment I have is their tables, especially the wooden ones inside, are ALWAYS sticky. This is consistent over years and has not changed. And, OMG! their new halibut fish taco, which I'm having right now, is off the chain!<//review>

You need to be buzzed into the bathroom but there are no signs telling you...so I waited at a locked empty bathroom for 5 minutes before asking an employee.

There is also no disabled entrance. 🤷🏼‍♂️</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

It was my first visit to Rubios .Very poor customer service. It takes a while to get access to their public restrooms. Have to make several attempts before they open their bathroom door. Will not go back there again.< /Text>

<Text>Has been a staple food us on taco Tuesday night for over a year, but now they appear to have staff turnover  issues: long lines, variation in food,  delays, drinks out of stock etc. Might need to find somewhere else.< /Text>< Name>

<Text>Good rates, but bring your own tape measure. Had a discrepancy over over 14 square feet and was told "tough luck deal with it". Facility is clean for the most part, I saw a dog piss on a parking column. Don't expect covid safety to be enforced, people going into the elevators without a care.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Pros: Clean facility, good value, security, and very very friendly staff

Facility has external gates that are only open during storage hours followed by gates and security locked elevators- you are given a code and you can only access your floor.

Staff are very friendly and willing to help in any way possible. I can't say enough good things about them- if you need a storage, stop by and see it for yourself. Joe is great!

Value: their pricing i believe is on par with the market rate, they do offer specials so it doesn't hurt to ask. But with all that you get, I think this place is worth it.

Con: can't think of any

Overall, when I was searching for a storage, I called around for rates and availability. There were some that were nationally ran where the call center was in some other state and their sole goal was to make the sales. When I called Los Angeles Self Storage, someone actually picked up the call, gave me the breakdown, provided me with directions and when I got there, they walked around to show me the storage itself. Everything went very smoothly and on-site staff were on point with their customer service.  All this was actually at a lower monthly rate than other places I called. So, they definitely earn 5 stars and I hope you will check it out for yourself!</text>

I just completed a move to LA Self Storage and had a great experience! This was my first time doing storage ever so I naturally had a lot of questions but Tony was extremely patient with addressing my concerns as well as showing me different options. I highly recommend LA Self Storage - ask for Tony!</text>

Joe and everyone else who works here are always super friendly and helpful. I have never had any trouble being able to pull my car right in to load and unload. It's also very clean inside as well. The location is super convenient because I can hop right on the highway to head to events or hop right off on my way back to unload.

<Text>I am very impressed with this storage facility.  It is clean, has easy access from car to unit.  Joe the manager & Otto give expert & friendly help.  Great prices for a city storage facility.  Good location for Los Angeles City area.  It feels safe to me, with their use of codes & the layout.  There is lots of parking & plenty trolleys .  In my estimation, they are simply really good at what they do, down to the details.  I am happy that I came to this place.  They get 5 stars +.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<text>I stored my belongings at LA Self Store for almost 10 years while living and working around the world. The store was very clean and safe. The staff always courteous, responsive and helpful. Overall, a great location, facility, staff and experience. And good pricing for a downtown store as well. Highly recommended. I only moved out because Ive relocated to Canada and now have the desire to reengage with our many great memorable pieces, a few luxuries and the wonderful reunion with vintage clothing in store. THANKS !<//text>< pics>

Really well run storage facility. I like that you have to punch in a code so it will only take you to your floor of your storage. We have had issues when our card on file expires or the bank issues a new one and they have always been great at handling that as well.< /text>

The manager Joe as well as the entire staff are extremely professional understanding and compassionate people who understand the needs of their customers I would highly recommend anyone to come to the storage unit and know that your stuff would be safe and secure.

<Review>I called other storage facilities in LA before renting a space here. They were dishonest and unreliable. I found LA Storage to be the lowest price while offering the best customer service. I am particularly impressed with Joe, the site manager. If you are looking for a safe, clean, fair priced storage, look no further.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I had a great experience at LA Self Storage.  Lily and Joe went out of their way to help me during a difficult move. The facility is kept clean at all times and I had easy access to my unit. I highly recommend Los Angeles Self Storage to all my friends and family.

Hi, my name is James Campbell and I have been a tenant at L.A.S.S. for the last  three and a half years and it is to my finding that their staff are very professional and really down to earth people that can handle almost any situation that might occur. I can't explain the relaxing environment at lass as well the comforting music that comes along with the deal.  What a deal!  Keep the great work up!</Text>

<review>LOVE Big City they have terrific customer service! Even though it's a small store they have a huge selection from cookies ice cream Starbucks coffee apple juice orange juice laundry detergent fabric sheets for cleaner to baby bottles. Like I said wonderful selection for such a small store and they're always open till 1:30 a.m. . Which is perfect for me because they are the only store and the 10 block radius that is open that late.</review><UserId.>109869145647998467241</UserId.>< Rating>

<text>Convenient of course if you need something quick. But definitely over priced like most family owned places. .75 cent debit charge. Sometimes I want a quick snack and have no cash. I want a twix or something. I end up paying double for a candy bar. I can go to 7-11 which is not far if needed. Owner is rude. No customer service skills. But the younger guys are very nice and know how to treat people.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80d954179c08869d:0xdb8653c3fc226684< /gmapID></record>

<text>I've been going to the store for the past 25 years sometimes the owner Sam can be pretty rude for example if I purchase scratch off lottery tickets at another store and bring it to his store he gets an attitude also when I purchase lottery tickets on my debit card they charge a substantial amount between 5 and $10 depending on how many tickets you buy this is the only place that I know that overcharge on scratch off lottery tickets most of the time I don't argue or say anything because the story is convenient to where I live that's the only reason why I go there and I don't drink and drive so at the end of 2017 and going into the new year 2018 I've decided to limit my visits to the store or not go at all for me it's time for a change.<//text><time>1514476857301</time>< resp>
{'time': 1517883587551, 'text': 'Chevy, we have appreciated your business. However, it was always your choice to play scratchers and it was also your choice to pay the fees. Those fees were not forced on you, you willingly accepted those fees in order to continue playing. Over the years, we continually told you that excessive gambling through the lottery could severely hamper your future. While we wanted what was in your best interest, it was ultimately your decision to play or not. Here at Big City, people entrust us with their personal issues, a gesture that we take to heart. You were no different in this regard. After all the hours of heartache you have shared with us (very personal things that I would not write on this forum), we are perplexed as to what bad attitude we have had that you could be speaking of. We have always considered you a friend and wish you all the best in your future endeavors, and if Big City is not the place for you then that’s OK. Take care.'}</resp>

Two guys/the people who work there are arrogant,VERY VERY  rude and obnoxious the guy actually said I wish YOU drop dead. After me showing him that I'm going through chemotherapy and all.

Tiny little liquor store.  Poor parking.  Terrible spot to be pulling out of at this corner, no matter what time of day.< /Review>

Love, love, love this adorable little shop. The cupcakes are THE BEST I have ever had! They are worth every penny. They are not the ordinary cupcake. They have layers of deliciousness! They offer something for every taste. They decorate the cupcakes differently throughout the year and they are always super cute and Instagram worthy! The owners are super sweet too! They are right off the 215, conveniently located between San Diego and LA. If you are ever in the area drop in! You won't be sorry!!< /Review>

I've had four cakes made by The Cake Cottage and they have all been incredible. The cakes are always super moist and delicious. I've always been super impressed by their designs too. From simple to complex, their designs are always impeccable. We occasionally get cupcakes from here too and those are just as tasty.< /review>

At first I was a little skeptical but when she handed me the cupcake box I had to sit in my car and stare at it's glory. Why are they so big? How are they so good? Who's responsible for this masterpiece? I couldnt ask these questions for long because its hard to talk when your face is full of cake. I smuggled the last half into the house in my purse where I proceeded to hide in my closet and stuff it in my face like an angry cave goblin. My family will never know.< /Text>

<userid>115404010437258228068</userid><Review>I am looking forward to Susan making my daughters sweet 16 bday cake. Because of covid Susan gave us our cake tastings to go and it was so much fun trying all the flavors and toppings. Susan was friendly and went over everything with us in detail about the layers, designs, and pricing. Her bakery is so cute and she sells different types of cupcakes. People were lined up and calling to buy these cupcakes. They looked so beautiful and delicious.<//Review></record>

Large variety of flavors. I've only had their cupcakes but every flavor I've tried has been delicious. White chocolate raspberry is to die for!!<//Text>

I was looking for a cake that would 'tell the story' of some of my business partners in a humorous, creative way.  Susan and her crew did not disappoint!  The cake they created was not only fun, whimsical and EXACTLY what I never knew I wanted but it was the most delicious cake I'd had since I was a little girl and my grandmother made her homemade masterpieces.  Thank you for helping us create a fun and delicious experience!  I'll definitely be back!<//text>

Susan made the most beautiful custom cake and cupcakes for my baby shower! Our guests raved about how stunning and delicious they were. She was so helpful and easy to work with. I will for sure be using The Cake Cottage for all future events!</Review>

< review>
I looked up bakeries online, I wanted to bring some of my employees some delicious treats. Boy were these the best cupcakes I have ever had in my LIFE! My husband and I are real foodies, We like to search new places to try and just recently moving up to Murrieta we have tried a few places already, But this is BY FAR the best place out of any state or place I Have ever tried and the gentleman that helped me out was very pleasant to speak with. I will def be coming back here again and having them make my kids birthday cakes! Thank you!</review>

The are gorgeous cupcakes. The man working there was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Definitely will go back for my supplies!< /text>

We love the cakes from Cake Cottage. I say "we" because our friends and family are always amazed by these beautiful cakes and they taste just as wonderful. These cakes are the focal point of the event. I have order several cakes from Cake Cottage. I typically go in with a few ideas I printed off the internet, Susan takes all the elements that I love and adds her special touch which sends the cake over the top amazing. I have ordered many different favors such as chocolate cake with Kahlua cream cheese filling, lemon cake with raspberry filling, key lime pie, funfetti with strawberry cream cheese filling and the list goes on. I am always beyond happy with Susan works. If you need a cake for a special event Susan is your lady!<//text>

They are the best cupcakes around and Susan's decorations are beyond compare! I often give cupcakes to my dog sitting clients and she always adds a cute dog bone or kitty with the words "thank you." She makes it so easy for me and my clients and friends are thrilled. I would heartily recommend the Cake Cottage for all your events. Use them for holiday activities or gifts for networking raffles. Convenient and delicious!</review>< gmap_id>

My son and I participated in one of her seasonal decorating class.  Not only was it very informative but well organized.  My son who is 12 had a great time and would like to do it again.  Her products are always delicious fresh and moist.
I have seen several cakes that they have made .... amazingly beautiful is an understatement.  I highly recommend the classes as well as the cakes for those special events.<//Text>

These cupcakes are the best I've ever had. They are very moist and delicious! Susan has so many varieties to choose from. You can't go wrong with any of them. The Pumpkin cupcake is especially one of my favorites!!  She also makes beautiful cakes. She made a darling cake for my granddaughter's birthday. Susan never disappoints us!!<//review>

The Cake Cottage makes fantastic cakes and cupcakes! I ordered a cake for my husband's birthday party; I can only describe it as a work of art! Susan listened to the design I had in mind and made it more incredible than I thought possible! The cake was delicious, too! If you need a cake or cupcakes, the Cake Cottage is the place to go!</text>

My family is literally OBSESSED with the cupcakes from The Cupcake Cottage! We have tried over 10 different flavors and have never been disappointed.  They are moist and have the best frosting and fillings ever.  Our favorites are white chocolate raspberry and key lime.  Once you go you will be hooked.  I promise.< /Review>

<Date>1610512789511< /Date><Rating>3</Rating><Review>I am quite disappointed with this Smart and Final. I went here just to check it out, after visiting the UPS store next door, due to the Smart and Final on Hawthorne and Torrance Blvd shutting down. We came here for one thing- beef. As we proceeded to visit the back of the store, we noticed the line slowly backing up, although this wouldn't have been a problem, if they had enough staff. Anyways, once we reached the refrigerated areas where the beef was, we noticed about 1/3 was missing, leaving us with minimal choices. This wasn't a huge problem; the main problem is that they are understaffed. We waited 30 minutes in line, with only two of the registers open. The line was about 10+ people long, and they had 2 REGISTERS OPEN. To sum it up, these people are understaffed, and could use more help. We may return, just either during opening or closing hours.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2BpYNK5gligJJMtaVZcxh3UAmqbnLEY0wzXOz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

Store was very clean. As always very easy to find things as everything is labeled. I went in for candy and was able to see the candy lane that had many options. I was able to get what I wanted, and somethings I did not need, but oh well.

Waiting in line was great with social distance measures in place< /review>

<text>2775 Pacific Coast Highway, Torrance,  CA

Ava Lee is the name of the person who accused me of stealing.  1.  She asked if I had meat in my purse while I was paying for my groceries.  Claiming the store does spot checks on people's bags.  2.  When I told her that bothered me she claimed she saw me, on camera putting meat in my purse.  I never stopped at the meat department.  3.  I asked to speak to her supervisor and she claimed she was the boss (her words).  I called the store when I got home and the manager, a man had gone home, there was no manager in charge at 6:30pm today.  I asked specifically.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dd4a50ae67205d:0xd227582a3ae8ab7c</gmapID></record>

<review>They need to Mark clearly on boxes do not open if it's supposed to be purchased in large quantity. Other than that I like coming to this location because it's in the same Center that I do business with the UPS store that is right next door to them.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Well stocked. Cashiers usually nice.
Aisles blocked and crowded with food displays making it difficult to shop and reach items when someone else is on the aisle or the the employees are coming with more stock.
Line for checkout had about 15 people in it. Only 3 cashiers. 3 employees were standing around the front by office while I waited in line at back of store. Maybe long line because of curfew panic but it was that way last time too, without the curfew.
I rated a 4 because I usually have a better experience there.</review>

<Text>I hate going because they always advertise fully cooked chicken but the bin is "always empty".  I started coming around 1:30 and there would be around 3 left.  Used to be more chickens after 5:00, so I waited, & waited * waited by 5:30 I was told maybe another 15 minutes.  Poor management. If you put a fresh chicken sign out front to bring people in and there is no chicken, then you've lost a customer. I went to Ralphs.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dd4a50ae67205d:0xd227582a3ae8ab7c</GmapID>< user_id>

No membership card pricing to worry about. The price posted is the actual cost. I love the selection of items and the convenience of having the store nearby.<//review>

<review>I was some what surprised to find out that unlike other grocery chains. If you don't buy 10 items on the 10 for $1.00. They will charge you full price. More than double. It saddens me to think they want to compete with the major chains, but stoop to bait and switch tactics.<//review>< user>

<Text>S&F is a fine value and there larger stores complete well with all the other big grocery stores. Some of the older, smaller stores serve well as a neighborhood market for most items. They do have most of the same departments though there's a smaller selection.
I'm a single guy and I still benefit from buying the big box items. S&F is the only way I keep my monthly grocery bill in check.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

It offers more products since they expanded but checkout time was slow and they don't restock sale items fast enough. And oh they don't give rain checks on alcohol as they used to. They shouldn't advertise sales if they don't stock properly. Work in progress.<//Text>

< Review>
This store sucks, just found out today that they start the weekly special on Wednesday of all days. Went in yesterday & seen a special on a product & said to myself the week just started so I'll come back tomorrow & get it. Not knowing that the special would end that day. Reason for me not knowing was that they had no expiration date for the special nor did they have anything saying when the weekly specials started. How are we as customers suppose to know this without being properly informed?<//Review>

Very nice and helpful staff. Darren was very honest and even helped me save some money by recommending a repair part instead of buying a new one. Thank you for great service!</Text>

<Review>Great place and service for a hat.  I needed a hat for a special occasion and boy did they deliver! Justin the "Hat Doctor" was great and patient in working with me.  Not only did he show me different styles that worked for me but also schooled me on every type of hat that he was showing me.  I highly recommend this place.  The only drawback is street parking.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Owner was not in and maybe he was having a bad  day but the employee was impatient and quite confrontational to my son. I tried to let my 16 year old son handle himself as these are life skills but the employee would not stop pressuring and talking down to my son  so I had to step in and end the sale. We have bought all our hats for my three sons here   we and normally have had a positive experience. Lots of great variety in headwear.</review>

When I asked for help as I was looking for a simple brown hat he gave me a dusty dirty one and come back and sit down on his chair. I asked for a new one or a way to clean it up he said “no” you clean it.

I let that go and I went and pick another model. My size wasn’t available them I asked again for help and he said “ You can’t be so picky with hats”

After this I left really frustrated as this guy was a totally jackass. Needless to said all the bad words we interchange.

Come back to that shop? never!</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1595735615503, 'text': 'I sincerely apologize for this experience. That person no longer works for us. I hope you give us a second chance.'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

<review>The owner of the store really took the time to run me through tons of options since I didn't know what I wanted when I walked in. The guy's extremely knowledgeable and kind. I have a large head and have always had trouble finding hats that fit, but there were more varieties of cool hats in my size here than I could've imagined. (If you have a big head, you know what I mean)
Although this place has every hip or chic hat you could want, I went with something casual I'll be comfortable wearing every day. My dermatologist will be happy I found this place.<//review>< Pics>

Sal helped me out a lot. I went in and gave him a hard time looking for a fine weave Panama with a thinner brim (I was very exact, and very picky) He was patient and if he was annoyed he held it in really well. If you're concerned whether or not he is gonna be open, just call ahead like I did. I didn't get a hat, but if I do decide on anything, I'm going to Sal first.<//text>

< Review>
5 Star storage facility! I needed storage while in transition and the staff here provided me with all the help I needed. The building is very well maintained, clean, and SO secure! Desmon, Ashley, Audrey and Chantil are always ready to help with any questions I had and give me a laugh. They really take it to he next level! Don't bother with the "competitors", there is no match.< /Review>

Great, quick, efficient!
Staff are very sweet and refreshing!
The storage units themselves are very clean, and the security is top tier! I would trust leaving a few of my expensive items in my storage knowing they’re safe!
Great experience overall!
Thank you!!!!< /Text>

<text>Do not use these facilities. While the place is nice and new the staff is horrible! Treated me extremely unfair was disrespectful and just lack class. I have never i mean ever been treated as bad as i have at the place. The project manager looks like she’s on drugs. The other 2 people  were just very unprofessional. I repeat do not use their service. You can only access until 6pm. Just go down the street and use cube smart which you can access until 9pm or so.< /text></record>

I have had a great experience using Public Storage. The place is clean and safe and the staff has been very accommodating whenever I needed anything. Desmond helped me out when we first got our unit and has been very professional and friendly every time I have seen him there. I would definitely recommend Public Storage.<//text>

Very pleasant staff, from manger on down, safe and secure,  Although their cut your lock after 10 days of no payment is a little hard when you have to purchase another lock for $25,
over-all experience I give a 5 Star
1 year plus was my stay,

<Text>A big shout out to Desmond, Audrey and chantil for the help of getting my storage units. I have multiple units here and every time I need another unit I get great help and hassle free renting the units I need . I work for an emergency pack out company and need storage units asap . When I'm in the area I will always use public storage. This facility is well kept . They are sanitizing all the door handles and bathroom's as we were in packing our box truck.. this is a climate controlled storage facility so it's great for storing important items that will not normally do well in a regular storage facility.. these guys are great and always on top of every little detail to helping there customer's.. thanks for all the help..<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Jamie mefford</Name>< Response>

This is a great facility. It is very well maintained, meet and clean. It is climate controlled so I do not have to worry about my things. All of the staff at this facility, are very knowledgeable, super helpful and well versed at what they do. Excellent customer service, by caring professional staff this made all the difference. I have had many storage facilities in the past and this has been by far my best experience ever. I would highly recommend this location because of its excellent facilities and fantastic staff. Definitely a 5 star rating!!</review>

Audrey made my experience very pleasant. She provided me with positive service in an excellent, friendly, and professional manner. She took time out of her busy schedule to listen to my needs and concerns and showed me the unit that would best accommodate me. Thank you Audrey for making this experience stress free!!!!</review>

Very fast and friendly. My movers were running late (typical) and the manager (Chantil) was very helpful and understanding.

Also, my movers underestimated the size of the storage we would need so I had to get another one last minute. Patricia was able to get me another unit in the same building and floor, around the corner from the first unit to make easier for the movers.

Customer service was A+++< /review>

The team at the facility is second to none. They went above and beyond during my brief time of need.  Procuring the rental space and moving in could have been more difficult, but they made it simple and removed some of the stress. They were accomodating and had great attitudes.In addition, the facility is well maintained and clean. Furthermore, every staff member I met was helpful and displayed excellent cutomer service.< /Review>

As you probably know, he is a great asset.
Everyone in the office was very nice and helpful as well.

Good clean storage place, friendly staff, and very helpful.  Audrey was very knowledgeable with the rules and regulations as she showed me around the premises.  I decided on the spot not to tour any other facilities.<//text>

<Text>I was looking for a better place too store my stuff , was in a older storage place where I believed I was getting a better deal. Which wasn’t the case?. So I found P.S. in Spring Valley close friendly. Immediately once I got there they made me feel at home Ashley was very helpful and friendly . She help me pick out the best unit in my price range which was a heck of a lot cheaper then the competition and way more cleaner and up-to-date. Would refer all my family and friends to public storage in Spring Valley Thank you.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The staff is friendly. There are dolly's available. The unit is clean and temperature controlled. Fair pricing.
The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the available hours. They have very limited open schedule to access your space.< /text>

<Review>This place is very clean and the employees here are the best. I’ve been in my unit many times after business hours and they let me finish doing what I needed to do. Every employee I’ve encountered has been very polite and professional especially Desmon and another employee but I can’t remember her name. Thank you public storage.</Review>< pictures>

So with all that is going on people out of work still waiting to get checks from our government. So I called to ask if they were offering anything to help people out during this time and they quick to say “nope we are not “. Shame on I’m you Public storage as soon as we get over all this madness I will for sure be closing my account and taking my stuff elsewhere.< /text>

Victoria is a wonderfully cheerful, sweet, humorous, humble, knowledgeable and HELPFUL manager who helped me meet all my needs I had storing my belongings AND went above and beyond her required duties to explain in greater detail for me, MORE THAN ONCE, all I needed to know and do (because I was in a confused state due to how quickly I had to get out of my former home).  I am extremely grateful to Victoria for everything she did for me and very happy with her service and her wonderful attitude. I will happily recommend her specifically to anyone needing Public Storage's services.</Text>

This is the worst PLACE I've ever seen, They made my sister put her stuff back in the unit just to charge her for a month. The office and District Manger have no Customer service. They're more worried about going home on time. I would never understand how you can mange a place and take peoples money with no understanding of the word Customer Service. Seeing that I work in the Customer Service Field for over 20yrs.< /text>

<date>1587325622634< /date><rate>1</rate><Text>Unfortunately I did not do my homework well enough and used SpareFoot to get a comparison of storage units in my area. I found a Public Storage unit and reserved it. 10 x 15 upstairs unit, climate controlled, for $141/month.

I checked in at Public Storage the next day. The workers did NOT alert me to a difference in price between my reservation and their actual prices. Later that day I saw on the Public Storage website that they were only charging $128/month for the same unit, same characteristics. I had already left the storage place at that point and could not go back for 2 days. At that point I returned to the storage unit, showed the lady at the desk that they were only charging $128/month and requested, since this offer was also available only 2 days prior when I first signed up,  that they adjust my rate to match. They refused and stated they were unable. They also stated their District Manager Rob Fragoso would be unable to help as well. They did give me his contact information. I emailed him and we shall see if he responds.

At this point however, I can NOT recommend either SpareFoot or Public Storage. I am an unhappy customer.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I reserved a 10x25 unit online and was contacted by Desmon. We discussed unit availability and online registration. My move date was 2 weeks out and Desmon called me a couple times to verify my upcoming appointment and provide a status on available units. The registration this afternoon included going to see the unit and completing some final paperwork. Desmon was friendly and knowledgeable. There was no hidden costs and everything was explained fully. Desmon provides OUTSTANDING Customer Service and makes the whole process enjoyable.

Thank-you!!< /review>

Ensure you don't need access to your unit that you pay for when you want. They operate the same business hours that 99% of the work force operates. Inconvenient hours.< /Text>

I would definitely recommend Public Storage in Spring Valley to everyone that lives in the Spring Valley/La Mesa area. Especially with the new building opening soon, Public Storage is the best location and alternative for homes with limited storage space.

<Review>It's nice to have good customer service these days.  I wanted to get a storage space and I went to this place.  Well lit.  Clean.  Safe.  Miguel assisted me when I inquired him about renting.  He showed me my options.  Answered all my questions.  Was very courteous and considerate.  He was very upfront with all the paperwork.  Thoroughly explained everything.  I felt very comfortable.  Miguel was friendly and professional.  I also had a chance to talk to Ben.  He was very friendly and assisted me as well.  A warm experience.< /Review>< user>

<Review>Today I received a nearly incomprehensible VM message requesting I call the Sweetwater location regarding my storage unit which I rented in late June and vacated on Friday, August 3, the precise day I physically came to the facility and specifically announced to the young man at the counter that I was vacating the unit that day- Friday, August 3.

Although I had specifically announced my intent to vacate, I was still required to pay the full month rental instead of a prorated amount since I presented, in person, on Friday August 3 to clear out my unit.

Today, Sunday August 12, I not only received a message directing me to call but I also received an email documenting my move out date as 8/12- not 8/3. I paid the August rental with a bank card there at the Sweetwater location so there will be no problem verifying I was there in person and paid on Friday 8/3.

I called back and spoke with an easily agitated Victoria who seemed utterly incapable or too preoccupied with dismissively um hmming me to even listen to what the reason for my call was. What I requested, and it's an entirely reasonable request, is to have an email receipt reissued that ACCURATELY reflects the actual move out date which was Friday, 8/3 NOT Sunday 8/12, the date Victoria states "they" *discovered* my unit empty.

I don't understand why they would want to perpetrate a bizarre fraud rather than accurately reflect the actual move out date and then provide me with a document that verifies the actual move out date.

I also question why I was compelled to pay for the full month of August instead of a prorated amount which is what would happen when you initially enter into an agreement with Public Storage after the first of the month. Victoria characterized this as a "courtesy" rather than the *policy* it actually is. That characterization makes no sense!

Again I used the unit from 6/28 to 8/3. I simply want the records I must submit for my expenses to accurately reflect the actual period of time I actually used the unit. I don't understand why such a simple and reasonable request cannot be accommodated with the requisite polite customer service attitude, speed, and protocol.<//Review>< pics>

Patricia made our process of renting out a storage quick and simple. She showed us the size of the estimated size recommended for our items. Explained all the papers that we were filling out and what we will be paying for. Answered all the questions we had. Definitely a PERFECT first time experience renting out a storage!!!</Text>

I rented a unit.  Heather gave me the one right at the end of the T intersection.  2 weeks later I realized I needed a little more space. I rented a 5x5. Heather found me one right across from my other unit.  I am happy with this facility.  It sure beats the facility located on Johnson in El Cajon.  Thanks Heather for all your help!<//Review>

This public storage is great, clean and well maintained..Ben is awesome and has exceptional customer service skills and is so down to earth. He has explained everything in full detail, stopping along the way to make sure he has not lost me and welcomed any question I threw his way. I was stressed beyond my breaking point trying to find a storage facility that didn't require you to sign a 1 year lease..I found this facility and happy to say my stressors have diminished knowing my things will be kept safe and protected not to mention its month to month..I recommend this place to anyone.</Review>

Patricia was a fantastic employee, and provided us with excellent customer service, and treated us with the upmost respect. I highly recommend anyone who might be shopping for a unit to stop by and see her. She's very professional, and a joy to deal with. The units are very safe and secured and are all indoor. I feel at ease leaving my belongings at this storage unit.< /Text>

<Text>Most of the reviews I read about this place were positive when I decided to store my stuff for ~6 months. However, my experience was entirely unacceptable. I had no issues with the storage of my goods, however the same cannot be said about their billing practices.

I paid upfront for my entire rental in order to make sure I locked in a good rate. The contract had written across is "Paid thru January" to make it abundantly clear. However, their payment system did not recognize the rate and continued to claim I owed payments. I spoke with people on-site no fewer than 5 times about clearing up the billing issue in their system and at no time was it resolved. I moved my stuff out, again being told the payment needed would go away, only to get calls a month later from a COLLECTION AGENCY! I'm getting calls at 6AM about a bill I don't owe and have asked 5 times to be corrected! Finally it appears they have corrected the issue but this is ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE!!! BEWARE!<//Text>< Pictures>

Maintenance issues seem to be a recurring theme at the facilities I've been to. Doors that are supposed to be locked either do no lock, or are purposely kept unlocked? Elevators are finicky, and so far the staff I came across seemed very quick to attack unnecessarily. For example. In everyday driving scenarios we see and abide by bright red stop signs a long white line that designates Where to Stop. But in this Public storage, they do things another way. At the main gate entrance, the one with the gate code. The pin pad and gate markings are so poorly laid out and so ridiculously close to the gate that you immediately take for granted that they did it on purpose.. Wrong! So make sure you Stop.. not behind any sort of line, or red Posted Sign but, at least 10 feet away on a square painted box on the ground. Then get out of your vehicle and punch in the code quickly before anyone steals your car while you block traffic, Or else You Will be verbally assaulted by miss angry pants.. Even though it's not your fault, and all could still be avoided with a simple 4" minimum LINE... Spanning the length of the gate for the designated SIDE. Just Pick One.. And if really snazzy maybe a normal red STOP sign. Rather than run outside and attack guests and helpers for simply trying to decifer what the heck is wrong with "your" set-up... I'm Sorry if that offends anyone. But thats a few things that have nothing to do with me, and everything to do with how this place is operated. On the plus side, Easy access to carts is very helpful, and the locker doors look very nice... dare I say, new? Just a heads up, I think you can only put one lock on these handles. Where some allow two and may prefer it. I could be wrong though. And I hope I am.<//text>

The facility is very clean and very well maintained, so that's the good part. The bad part is that my husband and I ended up leaving the site and going down the street to rent from a different storage company as a result of Ben's overly-pushy sales pitches. We just wanted a storage unit, period! and that's all we needed and that's all we came in for, but the aggressive way we were being ATTACKED into buying tape, rope and boxes that we simply did not need had such a negative impact on our decision that we are happy we chose another company. Just an F.Y.I. for anyone else who would rather not deal with feeling victimized.<//text>

This is one of the more expensive storage facilities in Spring Valley but it has climate controlled storage which is a huge plus.  Our rent has went up steadily over the previous 2 years.  I guess this is a way to force the folks that have been there a while to move out.  Nice location and they are currently expanding their facility.<//review>

<Text>Sovenia was not only helpful and courteous, but she was welcoming and enjoyable to be working with. The facility itself is clean and well organized.
If I could make any recommendation, it would be to move the entrance and exit keypads so they are accessible without getting out of the vehicle (all the other locations I've used are setup that way).

<text>I am very disappointed with the quality of the storage unit. I paid over $200 to store my brand new furniture to this storage unit because I was told that this was a very nice and neat storage facility. After just one week of having my belongings in the unit I started to see an abundance of cockroaches. The facility at this time was doing all new pavement construction. I notified the front desk and made calls to alert that the infestation was happening. I was simply ignored and told to call CS. I'm still expierencing cockroaches.... I want to reiterate that all my belongings are BRAND NEW. I just want my money back.< /text>< pics>

First I would like to say that Sovenia, was the first one I talked with before choosing your storage facility. She was very friendly, as a matter of fact, because of her cheerfulness and honesty, I choose this storage facility. I also had a great experience with Broolklyn on Saturday 10-5. She was extremely helpful and kind to me because this was the first time I had to store my belongings in this facility. Keep up the excellent work ladies and I will certainly recommend this storage place to all I know who may need storage.< /review>

Staff is friendly but that's the only good thing I can say about this place, they have the worst hours of all storage places in the area, closed during holidays, elevators constantly break down, some hallways are in the dark due to burnt out light bulbs, management does not respond to calls or complaints, I could go on but there's just too many things to list. So I left!< /text>

<review>Due to my cross-border lifestyle I had the pleasure of multiple visits to this facility, dealing with every staff member.  This place must have a great manager who knows how to hire and give incentive, because without fail the staff was openly and honestly pleasant, concerned with their customers, and dedicated to details - and they have fun doing it!

Big thanks to the tall and most efficient woman who forgets her nametag, and to the knowledgable, beautiful and always smiling Cyndy.

Due to my business I have used a lot of storage facilities across Canada and the U.S., and none have come even close to my positive experience here!

The facility itself is great, always spotless, and centrally located.  Mad props to this location and the team!

My only critique: you have a security gate;  I urge you to keep it closed.  Better safe than sorry.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Moved here from another storage place that we were unhappy with. We were greated by a very friendly knowlagable staff that knew exactly what we needed to suit our needs. Grounds were very clean and well kept. Over all an exceptional expirience from where we came from. Plan on using this fecility and recommending it to anyone who needs to store their shtuff.!</review>
