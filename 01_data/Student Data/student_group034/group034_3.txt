<rate>5< /rate><Text>The team at Angela's office is awesome!  Someone on the team is always available to help answer any question on any of my policies.  They have also helped find options to reduce my premiums whenever possible.

The team is also very fast to help.  My last call with Elissa was a perfect example of the type of support I have come to depend on from this office.  She was quick to help add some missing information to one of my policies and then went the extra mile to email me a copy in 5 minutes so I did not have to wait for it to update on the online system.

I highly recommend going to Angel's office for all you insurance needs.  They are very nice and easy to work with.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Arlene is the rep that mainly helps me and has been fantastic throughout my experience. She has helped me walk through the claims process as well as helped me find all discounts I am eligible for. State Farm in itself has been great as well. They are very good with communicating what is going on with claims and very transparent with what you are being charged for. I also use the State Farm app which makes it very easy to get even faster updates and pay my bill. Overall my experience has been real good and would high recommend going to State Farm and Arlene for insurance.< /Text>

Angela is the best.

I work in customer service myself and it is important to make a connection with the person you are helping before you help them. Angela does just that.

"Clients won't care how much you know, until they know how much you care."

Angela is an absolute 'Mama Bear' making sure all her cubs are taken care of. She also is a wealth of knowledge with wisdom her clients get to benefit from. I've not experienced this kind of service in the industry and I am relieved to have her on my side. She is truly an ally and her team reflects her values. I don't think I'd work with anyone else now.

Thanks Angela and team!</Text>

My husband and I worked with Angela on a complete portfolio of car insurance, home insurance and life insurance. She was very helpful, insightful and understanding. She was able to save us money on all of our policies and made sure we had the correct coverage. Overall she was a delight to work with. Very friendly and personable.

<text>I called to get information regarding some of the different services that are offered, and had the pleasure to speak with Anthony Guzman.  He was very professional and answered all my questions, very knowledgeable.  I am looking to change providers because of a bad experience with my current insurance company and have been calling around.   I am so glad I called this office.  Anthony really explained everything to me in a non-pushy way and made me feel really comfortable. I did not get the same treatment when I was calling around.
All I can say is if you are looking to get insurance or change your current provider, call  Anthony.  I'm glad I did<//text>< user_id>

I recently moved out on my own and needed my own policies, which Marian helped me with. Marian did a fantastic job; she was professional, responsive, and always kept me updated on what was going on.

Ultimately I did have to get renters insurance from a different insurance company, but only to meet specific requirements that my landlord had. Otherwise I would definitely have gotten a policy from here. This agency clearly cares and it shows through their employees conduct! I would 100% recommend going through Angela Frangieh!<//review>< pictures>

Anthony Guzman, a recent addition to the office, is easily the best agent I’ve worked with in my three plus decades with State Farm. He’s extremely personable, professional, patient, industrious and honest. I always look forward to speaking with him because no matter the issue, I know he’ll resolve it and then explain everything in a clear and concise way. Please don't ever let him leave!

I had questions abt missing payments on my State Farm accounts due to the pandemic. As I have several accts, I wanted to make sure I wud still be covered. I spoke to LIZ at the IDAHO office and she was very patient with me and thorough, as I wanted to allay my fears of not being reinstated. She told me abt how payments cud be made to “catch up” and assured me that everything wud be ok.Everyone at Angela Frangieh’s San Jose office is always helpful and patient. There are so many problems with this pandemic and LIZ helped me understand how to eliminate this one!</text>

I have reached out to Arlene Gonzalez and Sarah Davenport from Angela Frangieh's agency in the past 3 years. Every six months or so I would reach out to them and ask for a quote and usually it was pricier than what I was paying. They were always patient and helped me understand the various aspects of the policy in a timely manner and explained the pros and cons of the choices. Never got impatient because I didn't buy the policy after doing price comparison.

Finally I was able to get premium estimates from State Farm which was lower than my current policy. Arlene was kind enough to take my existing policies, compare them and provide me with quote which was lower than existing policy-  I was happy to switch! When I noticed minor things in the policy she replied back with resolutions or answers in a timely manner. Overall happy with the switch and service provided by Arlene, Sarah and the agency.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I can't begin tell you just how pleased my wife and I are with Angela's Agency, including her entire staff!  I've been a State Farm customer for over 25+ years and my original agent for all those years, just retired.

Not knowing what to do and very concerned about whether or not I'd find someone as good as Ed Bright, I explored my options by calling a handful of State Farm agents in my area and interviewing each of them.

I found my replacement agent in Angela Frangieh and sooooo very pleased with her, and her approach / methodology in reviewing a  new clients coverage to see where there might be exposure /gaps in the correct amount of coverage based on your assets etc.

Bottom line is, we will be with Angela for as long as we're on this planet and so glad we found her!  Thanks< /Review>< pictures>

For starters let me express how my perspective on insurance changed by contacting State Farm. Not only was this office quick and responsive but it exceeding my expectations on customer service. I had the pleasure of speaking with Marco. He did an amazing job at reading my policies that my current life insurance did not throughly inform me about. With this in mind he was able to find me even better coverage and made sure to inform me about every detail. Marco and his team are amazing, I can’t wait to settle with my current insurance & transfer over to State Farm!< /Text>

< Review>
When purchasing my first home last year, I reached out to Arlene Gonzalez, at State Farm, and other insurance companies for quotes. I knew very little about home insurance but Arlene was very helpful and knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. I ended up choosing her to be my agent and moved my auto insurance over to State Farm as well. I acquired another property this year that needed to be insured and Arlene set up an umbrella policy for me. She's always been kind, professional, and responsive. I know I'm in good hands with Arlene and State Farm.</Review>

Never thought I'd feel so passionately about my insurance! My husband and I just got married and recently relocated to the Bay Area. Insurance can be so confusing but Sarah reviewed our old individual policies and worked to combine our policies based on what our needs are now as a married couple, and helped set up some new policies based on our new living situation in California. On top of that, we had an incident with our home for sale in KY and she helped research and answer some questions about our home owners insurance when our agent back home wasn't being helpful. Angela and her team are truly incredible. Go see Sarah and she'll help simply everything and put your mind at ease!</text>

Angela and her team are just amazing.  I have multiple policies with them and the level of service they provide is stellar.  They take the time to explain all my options and find ways to increase my coverage and reduce my costs.  I cannot believe all the effort they have put in to helping me with life's changes and challenges.  From my accident to my life insurance they are the definition of 5 star service.  They are like family.< /Review>

<review>Angela Frangieh's agency has always been there for me when I needed them -- and even when I didn't truly know I needed them! When I was a college student, they offered me their banking services so I could build my credit. When I moved into my first apartment after graduating, they got me a multi-line discount and combined my auto insurance with a new renter's policy. Now that I'm a working professional, they are initiating a money market account through their banking services so I can start saving adequately and properly plan for the future. I know that this agency truly has my best interest at heart -- I'm sticking with them as long as Angela is around.<//review>< Pictures>

I do not have enough words to express how grateful I am for Angela and her team. They go above and beyond in service and are always prompt, helpful, and make insurance an ease.
I got in my first car accident this year and the claims process was so easy and well taken care of by State Farm. I've heard of others battling with their own insurance in accident cases, but with State Farm this was a good experience In a stressful situation.
I now am protected by disability, life, renters, car, etc. policies and it is such a great PEACE-OF-MIND. Angela has gone out of her way to make sure I am taken care of. Cannot thank her and the team enough!<//text>

We are so pleased we moved all of our insurance business to Angela Frangieh at State Farm.  We have numerous vehicles, boats and house insurance needs, and it seems we are always making changes or inquiries regarding our insurance.   We instantly saved hundreds of dollars a year when we moved over to State Farm and Angela.  Angela and her amazing staff always take their time to answer our questions and provide us the highest level of  industry information and options to meet our insurance needs.   Angela's high level of energy, professionalism, and kind heart keeps us feeling safe and secure.   You are wasting time, energy, and most likely money, if you don't check out all that Angela and staff have to offer.

Thank you,
Liz and Steve O

Angela is fantastic, informative, and genuinely cares about her family. Of course I say family rather than "clients" because she genuinely gets involved in the lives of the people she works for. She literally is in the business because she wants to make sure that people are prepared for the future, and it comes from a genuine place in her heart. She honestly just wants to make sure that you don't find yourself in a horrid situation because you didn't know your options.< /text>

Angela and her staff are WONDERFUL!  Tiffani Brownie there specifically there is one of a kind.  She is very knowledgeable in auto, life, renters/home and very good at explaining how I could save money on an auto loan with State Farm Bank.  I appreciate everything Tiffani has helped me with.  If you're looking for a great State Farm Agent in the area call Angela's office, and ask for Tiffani!!< /Text>

<Text>LOOK NO FURTHER!!!

Angela is the LAST insurance agent you will ever need, because you will never want to work with anyone else! Whether you are a young person looking to start protecting yourself with renters insurance and life insurance, or a small business owner looking for help with a complicated situation, Angela and her team are TOP NOTCH for delivering personalized service that can’t be beat. Angela and her team go above and beyond to ensure that you and your family are best-equipped to succeed in life, without trying to sell you unnecessary products or policies. I recently switched from a different State Farm agent to Angela, and I couldn’t be happier about that decision. HIGHLY recommend Angela and her team! She is one of the sharpest and most driven individuals you will ever meet, and trust me, you want her on your team!<//Text>< pics>

<review>We have been with Angela's agency for several years now and we couldn't be happier with her services. Angela offers great rates and advises on the insurance options. She can put together an excellent portfolio if you have multiple assets (properties, automobile...) We have been with every other major insurance company (Allstate, AAA...) and countless smaller companies and none that we had in the past can compare. Her office and her staff have handled all of our claims very efficiently. I am very certain we will be with her office for many years to come.< /review>< user_name>

<review>As a young adult, the insurance and financial planning world can be incredibly intimidating and overwhelming. Angela's knowledge and expertise are comprehensive, yet she really takes the time to break things down in simple terms. Her willingness to go the extra mile to help me understand exactly what I need to be doing to protect my future is what will keep me a client of her's for life. Seriously, if you're looking for an Agent who will have your best interests at heart, this is the one! Thank you Angela and your wonderful staff - my family and I definitely trust that we're in good hands with you.<//review>< Pictures>

My husband and I have been State Farm clients FOREVER, and several years ago, our previous agent retired.  This is where our relationship with Angela began.  Her office called, set up a review meeting.  We immediately felt like we had known her for years. She is knowledgable, she listens to her clients and helps guide them to products which suit their needs.  Angela is a true professional who knows her products and services.  Her office staff is friendly, caring, and personable.  I would not hesitate to refer Angela to any of my friends, family and clients.</review>

<review>I am very busy at weekdays but Angela is very nice to help me with my auto policy on Saturday. She is very patient for explaining questions and going over the policy in details. She tries to help minimize the premium with the most coverage.</review>< Pictures>

Can't say enough good things about this office and Angela!  I am new to the San Jose area and she was recommended to me by a friend. So, I made an appointment to update my renter's insurance with her, went in and not only did she help me with that, she then blocked off most of her morning to answer some questions I had about IRAs and retirement.  Put simply, it was the most helpful and pleasant experience I've ever had at an insurance agency - and that's saying a lot…  Her and her staff go the extra mile to make sure you're taken care of which, especially in this day and age, has become a nostalgic thing of the past. Thankfully it's alive and well and on full display at her office!<//review>

I love Angela and her entire team, especially Karinna!  She took the time to go over all my polices, explaining all in detail and using real life scenarios to help you understand even more. Karinna is very patient, sweet and extremely helpful. She also follows up to make sure everything made sense and if you need any other assistance. She is special along with the other people that work on Angela's team! That is why they are the #1 branch in the country! Also, Angela is a great person and really treats you like family! She only wants the best for you and your future. I wouldn't recommend anyone else but Angela Frangieh's branch! I even referred a few people over to them, who were blown away by their service, willingness to help, unbeatable prices and policies! They even compensate you with Amazon gift cards! That's awesome! Thanks, Angela.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>It's very important for me to write another review for this amazing company because it never fails to make me a happy customer. Especially with my new agent, Angela. I opened my first hair salon and Karinna was very helpful in assisting me every second of the way! The customer service at this office is out of this World!! They reviewed my coverage and made sure I had the right protection for myself and my business! As a self employeed person opening my first business and not having time on my hands, Karinna CAME TO ME! She made everything very simple and that’s what us self employed people need. This office is the best insurance place and I’m very thankful I switched to Angela. Thank you Angela for making the insurance World easy for us busy business people and Karinna. Sending many blessings and success to this office!! Whenever someone needs anything from me I will be available to you all just like you were with me!!

I called today with a question regarding a student visa. Jasveen answered the phone and she was able to assist me. She told me that Student visa also offers rewards. This for me is a plus because I am getting credit as well as getting rewards! Jasveen walked me through the whole process and made it simple!< /Text>

<text>Second time coming here for tire patching. Both times, the job was done fast and professionally. They offered either patching from outside or inside. From inside is much safer and recommended, but costs more ($20). They just need to be a little friendlier (1 star deducted).<//text>< Rate>

I visited this place for the alignment service needed for my truck, my fourth year bringing my vehicles and the ones of the family when needed since a friend of mine recommended this place. I haven't used any other services offered at this shop but the alignment service is really, really good!<//Review>

The guy who does the alignment is great.

He does a fantastic job! $60 for cars and $70 for SUVs.

You can get an alignment for $55 somewhere else but I've always had a good experience here</review>

<Review>Ramos A&G Tire and Alignment in Garden Grove, CA. It was a really pleasant and accommodating experience. These gentlemen are kind, efficient and organized. I couldn't believe how quickly they finished all four tires with balancing. (Maybe 10 mins).
Thank you so much. Kimberly</Review><name>Kimberly Huet</name><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

<review>I have a nice set of aftermarket wheels, and after telling them to be careful with mounting the tires, they scratched all four wheels they happen to have scratched them all including the center caps when removing them to balance. They are supposed to have plastic or rubber covers for there pry bar and machines so that they don't scrach the wheels but they didn't so all of my new wheels are damaged and they refused to take the blame.  Forgot to mention that they also dropped one of my wheels which caused some damage to that rim. Don't go here to change your tires if you care about your wheels!<//review><response>None< /response>< username>

<review>(Translated by Google) Excellent service and good price, I recommend them, I went to the Toyota agency and they gave me a budget and they recommended me with Ramos tires and I got half the price of what they told me at the agency, that's why I recommend them, and they are professionals.

I’m a contractor and have a big truck with a lot of tool boxes on the truck and one of my employees broke the only key i had for all the boxes and since the boxes need a special key that only 99% of the time you only can get them through the main manufacture Because that’s what the  Ford dealer told me so i started looking for a lock key place like lock smith etc, but none of them would be able to make a key they told me i had to get it from the company that manufacture my truck body, and i did called but the manufacture its all the way down in LA and it would take them 2 weeks to send me a replacement key, so decided to try one more time and found Bill’s Lock & Safe Service on 860 piner rd, santa rosa and they told me to bring the truck in and that maybe they were gonna be able to help me , i drove to their shop and they looked at my tool boxes and they said that they would be able to make a new key in 10min 😳 which was surprising because all while the other places only offered to bust my locks for $100.00 😣  while Martin at bill’s  made me a ser of 2 keys which made my day and i was able to get all my tools out again ..they are really professional and i highly recomend them..</Text>

<Review>I needed an immediate rekeying of a door lock.  I called Bills and they told me they could do the work in about 15-20 minutes.  I removed the door lock, thus rendering the door 'lockless'.  I live in a very remote part of the west county, so I needed to have the lock back before nightfall.  I drove in to Bill's, arriving 3 minutes before closing.  Bill and his staff stayed late to rekey the lock so I would have it that night.  Great service, great attitude, nice clean and well light shop and a great staff.  You can't go wrong at Bills</Review>< name>

<review>This was a great place it was a bit busy while I was there but apparently there was a huge tournament the next week and people were getting in some practice. I rented the bow and a lane for an hour, an employee there (Matt) was kind and knowledgeable quickly showed me proper stance and draw technique. At the end I was able to hit the yellow. Definitely coming back.</review></record>

Drove down from Merced and boy was it worth it. I’ve been into archery for 12 years and typically would drive to big box office stores because of bad experiences at other mom and pop archery shops in my local area. Steve was incredibly knowledgeable, made us feel right at home, and even stayed late ensuring everything on my bow was set up to my complete satisfaction. 10/10 would recommend.<//text>

Steve allowed me to demo different bows on the indoor range before I chose my Prime Rival in target blue. I was even allowed to demo different stabilizers with different weight setups before deciding on two Carbon Craft ones. Even though they have been extremely busy as hunting season kicks off, Steve and Brian always make time to answer questions and provide helpful tips. I love the selection at this shop and the friendly and knowledgeable staff who are always eager to help. I highly recommend this shop/store to everyone.< /text>

The staff is very helpful I came in a half hour before closing fully expecting to be told to come back the next day, not only did they adjust my bow for the correct draw length but they let me shoot well after closing time. Great shop to do business with.</review>

The personnel in the shop were happy, attentive and eager to answer all of my newbie questions. They were happy to set me up and demo some bows and even send me to competitors to try out bows they don’t carry, all with my, the customers, interest in mind. That is, to find the right equipment for my specific needs and fit.

I am an 8 hour drive from the shop but may, beacause of their service, opt to drive back up when i am ready to purchase.< /text>< pics>

Great customer service. I was ignored at another local dealer and was pleased with the helpful information provided here.  Chris spent 5 1/2 hours with me off and on between customers coming into the store.  He allowed me to demo three different bows until I found one that I was comfortable with. (Their on-site archery range was right on for doing that). I compared their prices to online purchases and found them a greater value due to the fact they set up every bow they sell in house and stand behind it. $1700 later, I couldn't be more pleased. No one needs to go any further than this place.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Very impressed with my experience at the spot archery. I didn't know what to expect for my first visit. I brought in a bow that I didn't buy here and asked if I could have a knock put on it. Right away the man at the counter I said no problem measured out and installed the knock while having an informative conversation with my dad. We checked out the range where you can shoot 20 yards with 20 lanes. There was no charge for installing the knock and my dad and I walked out almost surprised about the customer service and satisfaction that we were given. This place is a rare commodity. My dad and I are looking forward to coming back making purchases and shooting at the range. Thank you to the three gentlemen in the store who gave us their time and attention.</review>< gmapID>

< review>
This isn't just a place for pros to buy archery equipment. We had an amazing time there with rental equipment (just $20 for 2 hours) on their range. The guys there (Brett and Bill) were patient, encouraging, and fun, as well as expert archers.  We were cluless, but we had a total blast! I wish we knew about this sooner...came upon it by accident...its a perfect sport thats not too physical with the perfect combination of skill, luck, and fun. Had no idea this was available in fresno. It's not flashy or commercial, so if you're looking for chuck e cheese this isnt you place, but bring all ages of kids here for fun in a no age or gender barriers experience... we will be back to this hidden retreat... i dont think they really mean to be an entertainment experience, just a place for experienced archers to try out equipment...that's probably what makes it so awesome... glad they let us step into that world for a while!< /review>

Granted everything is in a take out container (thanks a lot covid) so occasionally you need to paper towel some food but it is still amazing. Also the red and green sauce are legitimately spicy so is the avocado looking sauce come to think of it. It's fast and I look forward to giving them more business when I can actually eat at the restaurant.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I’ve been here a few times. I’ve had birria one time before and I didn’t like it. I saw the reviews for the birria here and I had to try it and I am so glad that I had! This place knows what they’re doing when it comes to birria 👍 I haven’t even tried anything else on the menu yet but I’d imagine it’s all delicious. Plus the people here are friendly which is nice. This is probably my fourth visit back and haven’t found any reason for complaints 🌮<//Review>

<Review>Not coming back.  Put in a large order, for a large group of people, ordering plenty of goat BBQ.  Waited outside watching people get order after order, still waiting.  30 minutes.  Went up to counter frustrated.  Woman at counter said, we ran out of goat barbecue right after you ordered.  What do you want instead?
We've been waiting for 30 minutes and she couldn't be bothered to come up and tell us that!!!??!!!  After I left her a large cash tip?!
On top of all of that, the carnitas are dry, dry, dry.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This place is close by and happy I was told about it. It has amazing food! I bought a California burrito with carnitas instead and it tasted excellent! Also have tried birra queso tacos which was so bomb. Definitely recommend this place. Wish they had more pictures of the food on here though.<//text>

Birrias El Padrino is a birrieria that specializes in both birria de chivo (made with goat, popular in the Mexican state of Jalisco) and beef de res (made with beef, popular in Tijuana), among other varied fare. Surprisingly, the eclectic menu also contains San Diego-style Mexican specialties such as "Carne Asada French Fries" smothered in sour cream and cheese, as well as "Rolled Tacos" and "California Burritos" -- all of which seem out of place at a restaurant that allowed me a peak into their kitchen while their chef was stuffing a suckling pig for roasting.

Nonetheless, I won't fault the restaurant for doing what they feel is necessary to stay in business in North County, a ritzy region sandwiched between San Diego and Orange County that notoriously underappreciates legit Mexican fare, or edible food in general. I'm sure Birras El Padrino's burritos are pretty good, but I can't think of a reason in the world to order one when there are so many more interesting things to eat here.

I admire a place that does things the hard way, the right way -- and this is evident by the quality of the tortilla de hecho a mano (handmade) they serve their regular tacos with. I had both a "Goat Birria Taco" and "Beef Birria Taco" with this house-made tortilla and was impressed by the heft and flavor of the tortilla and the flavor and silkiness of the meats. According to the restaurant, they add birria consommé back into the birria once it is scooped onto the tortillas, a pro move to ensure the meats are at their juiciest when they're served to you. I much preferred their goat briria over their beef birria. It possesses more interesting and intense flavors, even as the seasoning and piquancy (of which there is much) is identical between both braises. The goat is mild-tasting, but still tastes distinctly like goat.

However, if you come here, you must order the "Quesataco de Chivo," my favorite goat birria taco in SoCal south of Los Angeles. They utilize two corn tortillas, the aforementioned house-made tortilla grilled AND a bagged tortilla dipped in consommé, with both tortillas griddled back-to-back except for the mild white cheese in the middle that melts, forming a crunchy and gooey taco shell that itself evokes a quesadilla de maiz. As the taco equivalent of a stuffed-crust pizza, this is perhaps the ultimate cheesy, spicy, greasy hang-over cure. Just writing about this taco makes me want to drink tonight until I'm cross-eyed so I have an excuse to drive an hour to Oceanside tomorrow morning to make myself right.

The "Consommé de Chivo" on its own was also pretty good with its heavy collagen content making it more of a sophisticated full-bodied, fully-realized rendered goat stock than what I've come to expect from birria consommé. This makes a great dip for the "Quesataco de Chivo," imparting even more flavor to a taco that has its flavor knob already turned up to 11.

This is a meticulously clean restaurant tended to by pleasant people who were proud of the food they are serving, in addition to being both curious and supportive of my current #SummerOfTastyTacos journey.<//text>

Good stuff. I come here pretty often, and have never had a bad experience. Very good food at good prices. They have a family deal with a bunch of food for the family for about 20 bucks +tax. Quesatacos are awesome, which is kind of a mini taco with melted cheese, birria meat and cilantro and onions, with the sauce on the side to did for extra flavor. It's kind of like a Mexican aju. Very good! Also their beans are good too, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to my beans Boi. The staff is very friendly also, and they will get your food out to you pretty quick.<//Text>

I went yesterday to eat supposedly good birria   At least that is what the reviews were saying Had a good flavor but instead of meat just goats skin all I got and we asked for 3 orders very disappointed. First time and last time to come to this place and it is called Birria’s place    If you still decided to go make sure ask for meat in your order.<//review>

Also plan to go back one of these Monday through Thursdays for their $5.99 breakfast plates.

Today we tried one of their machaca burritos. It's like the best one I've had in the area for an awfully long time and it was very large! So worse than money. 👌👍<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dc71a78b78d44f:0xb7b4006e80faef81<//gmapID></record>

Delicious! Best tacos in Oceanside! They handmake their tortillas AND they have Birria tacos which are so hard to find! If you like TJ tacos in Escondido but it’s too far to go to which is my case, this place won’t disappoint you! Oh and ask for the Queso Birria taco! 🌮🌮🌮</review>

<text>Best place for birria, the food is so good! My boyfriend and I usually like getting a quesabirria but today we actually tried the birria fries and they were bomb as well, so juicy. 😋
Customer service is very welcoming and the atmosphere here is very layed back. Along with great mexican music to make everything more enjoyable.🎶 Definitely one of our favorite places!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
This has quickly become my favorite coffee shop. The location is great, right on Santana Row, staff are friendly, orders are prepared fast (most of the time; there has been a couple of misses unfortunately), and I live the outside seating. It is quite limited during Covid, but still I enjoy sitting here and getting my work done!< /review>

<review>This store may be popular for many others. Today I decided to have a coffee outside after months. I have experienced two incidents here.
1. I asked for ceramic cup for my coffee and employee handed to me a cup seem to be unwashed. I tried to wipe off the dripped line of coffee outside with my finger and it did not go away. It means the cup has been like that for awhile. I asked for replace to paper cup and employee did with unhappy face.
2. I have reward to Peets, and today I tried to open the app while I order. The employee was supposed to ask me before she closed my transaction. When I was able to open, and she told my that she already closed my transaction.  And she started to lecture me that I need to do than scanning when I am ordering which is I know. Won’t go here ever again.</review>< Name>

< Review>
Peet's coffee is one of the best brands of coffee houses. Their coffee is strong and bold. Better use some cream if you are sensitive to the acid in the coffee
We enjoyed the outdoor seating for hanging out for a while. People watching is a great pastime and the passers-by offer one an opportunity to speculate on their story and how they came to be walking by just then.</Review>

Our hotel recommended this and cafe choco. We ate at this coffee shop for breakfast but I wanted to try their coffee as well, and it did not disappoint us! The coffee was amazing and strong and nonchemical. The desserts looked delicious too and the staff were very helpful. We will come back and recommend the place to my friends.< /text>

<Text>A couple friends and I stopped for drinks and treats here recently after lunch.  I think they recently remodeled so everything was nice and neat.  Lots of single tables which is nice since most Starbucks have taken out their smaller tables.  I had a nice soy pumpkin chai latte.  Tasted like a regular chai latte so not sure where the pumpkin flavor went.  I did have a nice maple nut scone.  The cashier did ask if I wanted it heat and I said yes but they just handed it me cold.  The code for the bathroom never seemed to work on one of the stalls.  Not sure why.  So overall a good location and drinks.  Not the best, but not great either.< /Text>< pics>

Super cute and yummy!! I ordered the rose milk tea, and shared some snacks with a friend (the potato crisps and the shrimp on sugarcane). The boba was delicious - real rose petals were mixed in, and the boba was perfectly cooked. The snacks are also freshly made and made a great combination with a sweet drink.</text>

<username>Grace G</username><review>Hands down my favorite Peet's in the neighborhood.

Although located on the Row, this Peet's location is very easy to get in and out of in the mornings (before 9am) with several parking spots out front and tons in the nearby parking land lots. The service is fairly quick and the staff are extremely friendly.

For tea connoisseurs, ask for the expanded tea menu.

Another bonus is that for every $25 gift card purchased, you get one cup of coffee for free! Yay!</review><response>None< /response><Pics>None< /Pics><date>1386572397725<//date><Gmap_id>0x808fcadfce97c533:0x294fdfdc3bb2b7d0<//Gmap_id>< userid>

I’ve been going to this Peet’s for a couple of years, every morning before work and on the weekends. :-P The staff are all very cool and very nice. The cafe itself is sort of small but it’s getting remodeled in September. There’s plenty of free parking on weekends and early morning weekdays with the addition of the Splunk bldg, and soon to be more when the new offices/stores are finished on the other side of the theater.</Review>

The service was fantastic!!! Big smile and friendly service 5 stars ++
Oh my gosh!! Best Matcha ever!!!! So so good
5 stars ++
Super busy and it looked like they might have been training a new employee. (The self service counter was a bit messy and sticky)
Overall service and pure goodness solid 5 stars.

Big place with plenty of seating in and outside.  Besides drinks they have a coffee bar also for beans.  The place does take a lot of sun in the afternoon so seating can be "limited".<//review>

Cosy atmosphere and nice cappuccino. Unlike London spots of the same style, the ham and cheese croissant is pre-baked, not a normal croissant with ham and cheese added. Maybe it's a US thing, but I prefer it european style.</Text>

Good Peet's when you are in the area. Seating is limited, so not the best place for work or meeting with friends. Staff is very friendly.< /Review>

Great little coffee shop on Santana row. There is a little seating area when you're tired from walking around and the coffee is simply one of the best in town.<//Review>

<Review>The main problem has always been slow service compared to rivals, and unfortunately this store is no exception.  Otherwise, good Coffee and service like other Peet's.< /Review><Date>1516842025020<//Date><Response>None< /Response>< name>

< Review>
Terrible Customer-service, the worst:  rude, indifferent employees, practicing DISCRIMINATION in dealing with customers, they DO NOT PRACTICE 'FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED'; instead, they serve those customers first that they think look best & whom they think will leave a bigger tip.  Not enough places to sit; small, cluttered, badly-arranged and BADLY STAFFED with RUDE, INDIFFERENT people!  AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT, as THEY PRACTICE DISCRIMINATION!<//Review>

Best Gym this Side of the Mississippi. Veteran Friendly 🇺🇸. Merch is 🔥.  Awesome energy and knowledge that you get from the members here, they are eager to help and will take time with you. Also they understand what you are striving for and they WILL get you there and further, while having fun. The Vibe is intense for every level athlete, and you will love the diverse machines/equipment. #LiftHeavyLiftPlenty</text>

I've lived in multiple different cities and this by far is my favorite gym. They have something for everyone. The whole community is serious but is willing to help and give advice. Communication and equipment is top notch while continuously adding new things. Will, the owner is dope and easily accessible if you have questions. Can't beat it<//Review>

<review>My son has potential to be an amazing powerlifter. Basic gyms don’t offer him the equipment he needs to reach his potential. The iron office has equipment that can help him be safe and reach his PR! Their friendly professional staff are helping to make this our new home.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Time>1602049210091</Time><review>I initially joined because of the flexibility of being able to literally whenever you want. I have a 4 month old and sometimes it’s hard to go during the day so early mornings work best for me. And here you don’t Have wait till 5 am to be able to do anything. I emailed about some questions and they got back to me super quick and were super helpful! I would totally recommend this gym for anyone who lifts and is working on their strength! You go in there and get the gym/lifting/muscle vibes big time.</review></record>

This gym is the best gym in the valley. If you go you will literally see me there. Friendly people and the real deal. Tons of new equipment housing all forms of fitness. Olympic, powerlifting, bodybuilding and more. They just moved into a new building, great location and they just keep adding all kinds of new stuff. Come check it out!
Sincerely,

Best place in town, bar none.
Best equipment, best environment, and best staff of any gym in the valley.

This is the spot if you’re serious about training or competing.</review>

Followed them when they moved to their location on academy in Sanger and even tried to still make time to go to their location in Fresno. This gym started my powerlifting journey, it introduced me to some amazing people/lifters that motivated me to start lifting. I always felt comfortable and confident in their gym and loved all the great equipment they had to offer. I did one mock meet and 3 usapl meets in their gym and loved each experience! Highly recommend this gym for anyone 🙂</Text><gmapID>0x8094f85601117f09:0x32614f69acef8c5b<//gmapID>< Date>

I just completed my second meet at this facility. The meets are well run, the facility is easy to find, access and compete in. They have plenty of equipment. The judging is fair. I drive 3.5 hours to compete in their meets and it's worth it. I highly recommend competing at this facility and if you have the good fortune to live in the area then this should be your powerlifting facility of choice.</review>

I loved this gym when I first got my membership back in June of 2018.

The 24 hour pass was very convenient with my schedule.

As of recently (noticed it July 7th), the scanner stopped working.

I texted the owner and they said they were working on fixing it. It is now the end of September at the scanner is still not working.

There has been multiple occasions where I have shown up to the gym and have no way of getting in.

I texted the owner with no response, it’s very frustating when you have to drive across town to workout just to find that there’s no way of getting in cause there are no real hours.

Really hope this issue gets fixed soon! I paid for the year long membership upfront and would hate for my money to go to waste.<//text>

I ordered through uber eats

Ordered 2tamales de elote (did not receive) had ordered 4 pupusas de queso and chicharron but got 1 cheese (tasty but not an option on uber eats) and 3 cheese and beans (deff not a fan) also ordered 5revueltas and these were delicious, ordered Yuka frita didn't come crispy due to distance n the chicharron was ok they were mostly chewy fat pieces..curtido and salsa were also yummy.<//review>

Food has great taste!!!  small portions for the price though.  Extensive menu to order from.  They have Salvadorian, Mexican and american food.  I would like for them to exchange the utensils they provide with food, for something more sturdy, strong, the small for they give out are  baby size, weak, and break easily.</review>

The food is great ! They serve beer have a good selection they close late around twelve or later depending on the crowd. You can watch sports they have a jukebox and the place is clean. Check it out !</text>

The waiter was cool, the food was a little undercooked. The prices are reasonable, the place needs a little work.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I love the food at this restaurant! I am Mexican and I have tried the birria tacos, they are very delicious and they give you consome !!!! I have tried the popusas and my favorites are beans with cheese and secondly the scrambled ones, the others are still rich even the cheese with grilled, I love the sauce and the tanning for popusas and the spicy sauce for delicious tacos !!!! I tried the red chilaquiles and it is the only thing that has not left me open-mouthed, the sauce they use for the red chilaquiles is different from what I am used to. It is like tomato with bell peppers, it comes with egg and rice and the rice was made very simple, it is white but it does not have vegetables nor does it taste like butter or salt or anything but it is not bad, I love that they put enough seasonings on you, I order at uber eats and they always send me enough napkins, forks and sauce and tanning.

Me encanta la comida de este restaurante! Soy mexicana y he probado los tacos de birria, están muy ricos y te dan consome!!!! He probado las popusas y mis favoritas son de frijoles con queso y segundo las revueltas, las demás igual están ricas incluso la de queso con asada, me encanta la salsa y el curtido para popusas y la salsa picante para tacos deliciosa!!!! Probé los chilaquiles rojos y es lo único que no me ha dejado con la boca abierta, la salsa que usan para los chilaquiles rojos es diferente a la que yo estoy acostumbrada. Es  como de jitomate con chiles campana, viene con huevo y arroz y el arroz se me hizo muy simple, es blanco pero no tiene verdura ni sabe a mantequilla o sal ni nada pero no esta malo, me encanta que te ponen los suficientes condimentos, yo ordeno en uber eats y siempre me mandan suficiente servilletas, tenedores y salsa y curtido.< /review>

We did an extensive remodel with JRP beginning in 2018 that consisted of planning, architectural design with the input of the team.  It was a great collaboration with their people and though the design and building process which is always a difficult one, it was made much easier with the influence of Grant Walker the project manager.  He is a gem of a gentleman and took care of everything soup to nuts.  We can still call on him for help as we need it.  We worked through the beginning of the pandemic, and found the entire team professional.  We had gone through this process once before with another company and ended up not pleased like we are with the quality and service provide by JRP.  Lori & Justin have built a great comapny and team and it makes all the difference in the outcome of your home.  We are tickled we get to live, lay and work in this Oasis!<//text>

JRP did a full kitchen remodel, guest bath remodel, new floors downstairs, and family room TV/fireplace wall remodel. We could not be more happy with how everything turned out! The entire experience with JRP, from the moment you walk into the showroom, is first-class. Our designer, Nicole, was so incredible to work with. Nicole has a great personality, and such a great eye  - she knew exactly the look we wanted in our home - and the finished product was exactly as she designed it. Our project manager, Grant, was awesome as well. I cant tell you how nice it made the experience knowing exactly what was happening on the job from day to day through Grant's daily logs. The owner, Justin, is extremely knowledgable, personable, and articulate - qualities that aren't too common with other companies we spoke with. Justin & Lori's professionalism is an A+. Thank you JRP!<//Review>

A friend recommended JRP to us for our upstairs remodel, which included three bedrooms, a bonus room, a master bath and a hall bath.  After meeting with them, we were confident in their expertise and were willing to pay a bit more for the full service experience.  Justin and the JRP designer, Hayley, had great vision and ideas for our new reconfigured bathrooms and a completely redesigned bonus room.  From demo to permits to finishing touches and follow-through our project manager, Grant, and his crew did an outstanding job.  Throughout the project, they were very courteous and professional, had great communication and completed the project on time and within budget.  We’d highly recommend them.

I don't post a lot of reviews for businesses but I felt I just had to after our recent experience with JRP.  We had our backyard gutted and a whole new design implemented.  Justin and Nicole were incredible during the design phase and they really do have a vision that few others possess.  I am so thankful for their design and am absolutely thrilled to be using our new backyard every single day!
Grant and Brent did a great job of managing the project.  It did go slightly longer than anticipated and there were some speed bumps along the way with a couple weeks of rain and then Covid hitting.  But in the end, it all came together and it is hard to argue with the result.  They transformed my backyard from an overgrown jungle to a beautiful and modern looking yard that I am very proud to show off.
I don't feel that JRP is the cheapest option but I also don't regret a single dollar spent on this project.  I do believe you get what you pay for in terms of quality and JRP certainly delivers quality!  I would absolutely use JRP in the future on any large projects and would recommend them as a trustworthy company that delivers on everything.  I have attached a few photos to show what they pulled off.<//review>

<Text>We manage multiple properties, and JRP Design and Remodel remodeled our personal residence in Newbury Park. From our first phone call, their attention to detail, through the design process, construction and wrap up, was the key in assuring that our completed project was above and beyond our expectations. We appreciated that Lori and Justin present and always requesting feedback to better their team and refine their processes.  The JRP team and systems was essential to help us to stick to schedule and budget. When any issues arose, the JRP team kept our project headed in the right direction. We highly recommend this company!< /Text>< Pics>

Several years ago JRP did a major remodel of our home. We were extremely satisfied with both the quality of their work and their process. Accordingly, they were our first choice to do some additional work - reconstructing a concrete wall and installing a new area drainage line. Again, we were extremely satisfied with both the quality of their work and their process.<//Text>

< Review>
After living in my lakeside home for three years, I finally decided to explore my options for remodeling my home.

I was referred to JRP Design & Remodel by my painter and decided to stop in and check them out one day. As soon as I walked into their showroom and saw their beautiful modern kitchen, I knew I could trust them to bring my vision to life.

Their customer service is amazing! Justin and Corey are very knowledgeable, as well as experienced. They gave me plenty of one on one time and understood my desires for wanting an open space with tons of natural light, a larger kitchen, and a more contemporary look.

I can’t say enough about my rapport with the JRP Team. They took care of everything from planning, implementation, and coordination of small details to major decisions. My project manager, Grant, is THE BEST. He communicated with me daily, quickly solved any issues that came up, and always kept me in the loop.

Everything that JRP promised, they fulfilled. All in all, I’m another happy JRP customer.< /Review>

We hired JRP after researching numerous companies online. We loved the concept of a design build company, where everything is controlled by one team.  The design process started in March of 2018. Justin’s design concept was exactly what we were looking for and we could not wait to get started. Our main concern was getting a functional kitchen that looked beautiful.  After getting our design finalized and permits secured we began construction in August 2018.  Our project consisted of a complete kitchen remodel with addition and composite cantilever deck.  Grant, our project manager, was available at anytime to talk about concerns or issues we had with the project. He was the perfect fit for us. Since we would be living in our house during construction, JRP set up a temporary wall blocking us and our two young children from the dust.  It worked out very well.  Trust me, as with any construction project, you will run into unforeseen issues.  The main difference with JRP and with other companies is that JRP will handle those issues in whatever way the customer wants them handled.  There were frustrating things that happened that were out of anyone’s control, causing our project to be delayed.  However, with our project completed, we don’t really care about the delays because everything turned out BEAUTIFULLY.   Our project was completed in January 2019 and after living in it for a few months we can honestly say we are so happy we hired JRP.  Our kitchen and outdoor space is a dream and we could not be happier with how everything turned out.< /text>

We are very pleased with our Downstairs/Kitchen remodel project done by JRP.  The in-house design team used high tech tools and innovative ideas to take our project conception and generate a complete design that exceeded our expectations.  We appreciated JRP’s turnkey approach of take a job from design to completion.  Their focus was on doing the job right and to our complete satisfaction.  Customer communication was enhanced by having an assigned project manager on site daily.
Jeff Schmucker, our Project Manager, did an excellent job of managing all aspects of our construction project in addition to keeping us informed of on-going and up-coming events.  He spoke with us daily outlining the current project status plus making sure the project implementation was meeting our expectations.  One of Jeff’s primary objectives was to ensure we were satisfied with the project as it progressed.  He successfully resolved all issues to our satisfaction.  Jeff had an excellent relationship with the Thousand Oaks City Building office and the associated building inspectors.  His good working knowledge of city codes resulting uneventful compliance with all aspects of the building approval process.  Jeff also had a great working relationship with the various trade contractors utilized in our project.  He kept the project moving forward by managing the tasking of the trades efficiently. The excellent success of our project was due largely to Jeff’s proficient skills managing construction projects.<//text>

JRP remodeled our master bathroom in late 2017 and we still love our bathroom. Design and workmanship was of superb quality. JRP was great to work with from the design through the finishing touches. Even after over a year of completion they still came out to fix a minor light issue.</Text>

<Text>After meeting with several contractors and designers we made the wise decision to go with JRP to remodel our kitchen and update much of our first floor. Working with JRP turned out to be a pleasure from start to finish.

The JRP design team spent quality time up front to ensure that the design for our kitchen reflected our needs and wants as well as their excellent guidance, expertise, and creativity. We loved their ability to create a virtual 3-D model that allowed us to “walk through” our house when considering design options.

Designer Nicole was wonderful throughout the design development and materials selection process. She had excellent suggestions. She listened well and was attuned to what we liked and wanted. At the same time, she was skilled at guiding us to reach confident decisions when we were unsure about something.

Project Manager, Vinny was outstanding as well. He was charming, professional, conscientious, and responsive. He clearly takes pride in his work and is dedicated to seeing that things are done right. The trades people he managed were always pleasant and hard working. They came on time, did quality work and cleaned up at the end of each day.

I can’t say enough good things about JRP. If you want a stress-free remodel experience, quality workmanship, and a beautiful end product, then you can’t go wrong with JRP.< /Text>< Pics>

I have been using JRP Design and Remodel for 8 years. Justin has always been fair and honest. We count on him for innovative ideas and quality products. These pictures are from a recent bathroom remodel. JRP has done a complete kitchen remodel, three bathrooms, created an office, as well as updating our plumbing and electrical. Their designs are timeless, I still get complements on the first bathroom they completed  back in 2008.<//Review>

<date>1614200266531</date><review>When we first met with Justin, we were feeling pretty claustrophobic, quarantining in our very brown and gold, Tuscan style home. We weren’t totally sure exactly what we needed to do to make it feel more modern, light and bright but we were initially thinking of the flooring, paint and possibly some changes to the kitchen cabinets or countertops. We were looking for major difference makers, while staying within a specific budget. Justin’s suggestions were absolutely SPOT ON! He suggested a bi-folding door to open up our family room out to our backyard, which was a complete game changer. He also suggested painting the whole house, painting our kitchen cabinets and replacing our dated kitchen counter tops and updating our lighting. Wow, our home transformed from dark and dated to light, bright and more modern. The entire process was seamless and the whole crew at JRP was outstanding throughout the process. JRP really is top notch in every way! They are organized and efficient and they make the process as stress-free as possible. They put the calendar and all pertinent details and updates on an app called “Builder Trend,” which not only helped us know what to expect and when, but also helped to avoid any miscommunications or billing surprises, which we have experienced in the past with other contractors. You do not have to worry…JRP WILL deliver as promised! And anything that may go wrong along the way, Justin is amazing at getting right on it and making it right. He really does care about not only the clients being totally happy but that the entire project lives up to a very high standard in every way. And that includes all of the sub contracts that JRP uses. They have all been with JRP for years and they do great work and go above and beyond to deliver. Grant was our Project Manager and he did an awesome job. He was always available if we had a question or concern and he worked really hard to make the project run smoothly and efficiently. We had a few unforeseen issues occur and Grant was able to come up with solutions in a timely manner. We really enjoyed working with Grant. Nicole was our designer and she was very patient and a great listener. She did a fantastic job of helping to guide us through the material selections and design process. She suggested things that we would have never thought to try and we love how it all came together. And, she somehow managed to make the remodeled areas work with the rest of the house. Our whole house feels so light, bright and modern and we LOVE it. We would not hesitate to recommend JRP Design & Remodel to anyone looking for a top notch, quality remodel. Thank you Justin, Lori, Grant, Nicole and the rest of the crew at JRP for everything you did to make this process a great one. You did not disappoint!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

We used JRP to remodel our second floor (three bedrooms, two bathrooms and an office). This is a full service contractor from beginning design to ending walk through. We are extremely happy with the service and our new second floor.  Our project manager, Grant, was easy to contact and answered texts/phone calls/emails right away. Our project was complete basically on schedule and all the subcontractors were professional, courteous and did great work. As with all remodels, there are always hiccups, but any issue was resolved quickly. We also added a few other improvements and, those too, were completed. I would recommend JRP to anyone as they do excellent, quality work.< /Review>

JRP Design and Remodel is one of the finest companies with which my wife and I have ever had the pleasure of working.  From the architectural and design phase through demolition, reconstruction, finishing and warranty work, JRP has been exceptional.  We actually had three separate projects/phases within our entire scope of work.  The overall project lasted more than a year.  While no project of that scale is painless - there are always some unknowns - JRP was completely transparent and incredibly fair at every point.

They are also remarkably clean and punctual.  We chose to live in the house during the renovation (probably would not do that again).  JRP's team showed up every day at 7:30am like clockwork and finished each day by completely cleaning up all areas that were impacted by that day's work.  We knew, in advance, what each day's process was going to be and had a chance to plan our lives accordingly.  Finally, excepting for changes that I requested mid-project, everything was completed on time and on budget.

I was a Mercedes-Benz dealer for 20 years.  I state that only to point out that I understand high quality, with physical products, with service levels, and with communication and customer treatment.  You will have to go a very long way to find a better company, people or product than what JRP delivers.  I highly recommend them.<//text>

Wishing you and your family many great memories in your new home.\n\n-Lori Pecikonis'}<//Response><Review>My wife and I did a comprehensive remodel with JRP Design & Remodel that started with design discussions in late 2018, and then actual remodel started in April May 2019 and we moved back to our home in October 2020.  The remodel was happening during Covid heavy restrictions that we did not anticipate when we started and thankfully to JRP construction team, it continued during Covid and JRP didn't miss a beat!

We started the project with limited knowledge on what we wanted other than new siding and a few other repairs to our aging home built in the 70s.  But with the help of JRP's design team (Kirstin was lead designer with the owners Justin's and Lori's hands on input too), we quickly changed our mind that there was much more needed to be done to bring our home to a higher quality home for our family to enjoy and also bring additional enjoyment and value to the home.  There were areas that needed repair that were outright dangerous to our family if we didn't address them (some wood support beams that were damaged, old electrical and plumbing, and even a small gas leak JRP detected under the house!).

JRP's 3D design work provided us with the pictures we needed of various options of the entire exterior and interior where we could see and understand the outcome of the home based upon various design scenarios and color schemes (a picture is a 1000 words!).  This was exceptional and very helpful to our decisions each step of the way.  My wife and I didn't have a particular design in mind when we started, and did not have a view on what we wanted to do.  It was Kirstin and the JRP design team that gave us the clarity we needed and helped us through every step of remodel re: design, color, options to consider, and other decisions on appliances, faucets, etc.

The day-to-day contracting team led by Vinny LaPierre was professional, very clean, and ensured the highest quality in everything they touched.  And JRP went out of its way to ensure we were completely satisfied including they didn't hesitate to adjust or rework a few areas that didn't quite meet our and their expectations...  JRP also provided us a 2 year warranty on the entire project which has given us peace of mind.  We already had some warranty items due to house settling a bit, and a couple of other minor things.  Vinny from JRP was quick to address and fix them.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< UserId.>

JRP Design and Remodel were wonderful to work with when designing our kitchen. The process of concept, design, and decor all under one roof made the entire process seamless from start to finish. The attention to detail, communication between client and staff, thorough follow through, daily updates and communication, and timely response to any issue made the entire project enjoyable. Our kitchen is absolutely beautiful! It is evident in the quality of materials, layout, and exceptional design and decor. Shoutout to Brent Stevens for his focus, accessibility, and ease in working together. First class and 5 star, for sure!</Review>

<review>We had a great experience completing nearly a full home remodel with JRP.  We found JRP to be accountable and we appreciated daily logs and thorough updates on project progress.  The subcontractors were all excellent and we felt they went out of their way to make construction timely and of high quality.  They anticipate, listen, respond and deliver.  We definitely recommend JRP strongly and would use their services again.<//review>< pictures>

We first heard of JRP at our charter school because they remodeled the onsite YMCA and the Teachers’ Lounge! Wow, it turned out gorgeous!  Since we had seen and heard so many amazing things about JRP, we felt we had to speak with them about our backyard remodel. We had completed an extensive and painful remodel when we bought the house in 2009, which ended badly. We had so many issues and defective work. It took another year to hire out different contractors to make the repairs and finish up the project.  As you could imagine, we were very wary of another remodel project. After the first conversation with Lori, we knew JRP was right for us. From the initial phone to their follow up and execution establishing our first meeting, the experience we had surpassed any other construction firm we contacted.

Once we met with Justin at our in-home consultation, we could tell JRP was a custom to creating luxury spaces. The ideas Justin discussed exceed our imaginations; their design process, project management, and their cloud-based client portal sounded all too good to be true. We quickly signed a design agreement and got started with the design process with our Designer, Kristin. Of course, we discussed lots of fantastic ideas, and the team always was quick to explain the incremental cost associated with the changes and provide input from other workarounds.

With the JRP process being so seamless and efficient, we quickly began construction. Grant was our Project Manager and was onsite regularly to ensure JRP’s high-quality standards were met. Any time we had a question, Grant was available to answer. The cloud-based software allowed us to stay up to date with progress by providing access to daily updates, pictures, and viewing the construction schedule. With any remodel, we undoubtedly ran into some unexpected issues, but the JRP team addressed it head-on and solved it quickly. One of our sticking points from the last remodel was the Punchlist. We wanted to be sure the completion of the project was accomplished promptly and thoroughly. And once again, JRP didn’t disappoint. Grant met with us, walked us through the finished project, delivered our warranty book, and added our concerns/issues onto the punch list; within a couple of days JRPs team wrapped up the final details.

We can’t say enough about JRP! They have a fantastic reputation, and now we understand why. They do it better than any other company we have dealt with before. From start to finish, JRP understands how to meet and exceed your expectations - especially that of a construction firm. We expected terrific results, and we certainly got that, but on top of that, we received an excellent experience. Our backyard is now beautiful and to our taste, and we couldn’t be happier with the results. We would highly recommend JRP to anyone looking for a high caliber build with a luxury experience.<//Text>

A complete kitchen expansion and remodel six years ago, an exterior makeover with new hardscape  and landscape, and recently remodeled our bathrooms.
The kitchen project involved everything from structural design to final decorating touches.  Of course we loved the new look so much we expanded into the Family Room for a comprehensive makeover.
The exterior project included new driveway, replacing wood siding with beautiful stone, new windows and doors, and a new landscape design.
The bathrooms were completely remodeled, each unique, but with some common elements for a cohesive feel.
The Design Center team are talented, knowledgeable, and frankly FUN to work with.  Participating in the concept through fine details makes you feel like a partner in the project instead of a customer whose space and routine have been disrupted.  The Project Managers are very "hands on" and present, checking in on every phase.
The crew are skilled, professional, punctual, polite, and neat.    Justin and the Project Managers were responsive to emails and texts whenever we had questions.  We are very happy with the end result of all projects and had many compliments from friends and neighbors.
We will definitely use JRP for future projects.< /text>< user_id>

<Review>We purchased our home knowing we were going to have to do a fairly extensive remodel given it was pretty dated. Being new to the area made it more challenging as we did not know many people, so finding the right team to take on this project was a bit daunting. We first chose to research JRP largely because we kept seeing their sign on existing remodels in our neighborhood, and other nearby neighborhoods. “If that many people are using them, they must be good!”
It was quite clear from everyone we asked about JRP, that they only delivered high quality. There really was no comparison in the confidence Justin provided, versus other contractors we interviewed: from creative ideas, to ensuring quality work, and selling us with the turnkey services offered through the Design and Build process.
Seeing the virtual renderings of exactly how our home would be redesigned, provided the comfort we needed when making this extensive investment.
Justin also made recommendations for things to consider, that we had not thought of, and I can honestly say they are some of the items that have made the most difference to us. So always listen with an open mind.
We travel significantly and were gone a lot of the time during the whole project. It was most critical to have a team we could completely rely on. The JRP team did not disappoint. They took care of EVERYTHING.
They were always responsive, and kept things moving, even when our lack of response slowed things. As with any remodel project of this scope, we certainly expected to encounter issues. However, unlike many other companies and contractors, JRP operates with extreme integrity. Every single issue we encountered was resolved in fair and equitable manner. (Special shout out to Vinny who was always available to hear me out and help resolve my escalation items- and always did so with extreme kindness)
Everyone was always very pleasant and kind throughout the whole process. The quality of product delivered is exceptional, and our home is beautiful. Very happy feeling settled in our place. I could keep going on, but I think you get the gist – Use JRP!< /Review>< time>

We just completed our kitchen and master bath remodel with JRP - Both spaces are beautiful, perfectly match our style, and add tremendous value to our home - we love it!  And it was a real pleasure working with the JRP team. We are no strangers to remodeling - we've done this all before, and it is such a pleasure to work with real professionals who care about their work and their clients (obviously this is not always the case!). Starting with design: Kristin did an outstanding job - thank you!  She listened to our ideas, merged those with her own, and brought us materials, appliance ideas, etc. that work perfectly together.  Our project manager/ contractor Jeff was a real pro - his communication with us was excellent, and if questions or concerns came up he was immediately responsive and found solutions every time. He's probably the best general contractor we've ever worked with.  And the team he brought in:  Fidel, Guillermo, Danny...too many to list, were great - excellent craftsmanship, attention to detail, and willingness to hear concerns/ make adjustments if needed. These guys were in our house a lot through the past couple of months, but they kept things clean and were very careful... and very kind with our kids, who were inevitably underfoot. We are perfectionists - so, we ask the same of those we hire -- and the JRP team met and exceeded our expectations. Huge thanks to Vincent our project supervisor, and Justin and Lori, the owners -- this company and team have our highest recommendation for others looking to remodel.<//text>

Remodeling can be downright disruptive and overwhelming (we had gone through it once before); so, it was very important to us to find an outstanding contractor who could provide “one-stop” services. In other words, one team to conceptualize, design, coordinate, and remodel our project. Fortunately, we found everything we were looking for and more in JRP. Justin and his team exceeded our expectations! We first worked with Justin and his team on a master bathroom remodel and were impressed from the earliest stages of planning. He and his design team have great aesthetic sense but are practical and transparent with pricing. We were fortunate to have Vinny as our project manager. Throughout the process, the JRP team was professional, friendly, conscientious, courteous, efficient, and tidy. The design was exactly what we envisioned, and their attention to detail and commitment to quality was evident in their work. Justin and his team promised and delivered a spectacular bathroom. We were so pleased with the outcome that we didn’t hesitate to hire JRP again for more extensive work including a 500 square feet addition the following year. In addition to a beautifully remodeled master bathroom, we have a gorgeous wine cellar that has been the envy of our many oenophile friends. Needless to say, we were delighted with the results. From start to finish, JRP takes care of its clients and long after the work is complete. We are truly impressed by JRP’s exceptional quality of work and integrity. We enjoy seeing photos of their beautifully completed projects in and around our town. It is no surprise that JRP has won multiple awards over the years.

Just finished a remodel with JRP and the final product is outstanding.  We began in March with the demolition of what seemed our entire house and the watched patiently as Jeff and his crews reshaped and created a state of the art kitchen, a beautiful living room, a stately library and a new office from which great ideas will surely spring. From top to bottom a class organization and a pleasure with whom to work.   Many thanks for all your efforts.</Review>

<Text>JRP did a beautiful job remodeling our 1970’s home into a modern, but functional coastal California oasis.   Both the outcome and the process to get there, far exceeded our expectations.

Justin and his team’s creativity and big picture thinking caused us to rethink our approach and resulted in a significantly better outcome than originally planned.   From the start of design to the completion of building and through to follow-ups, JRP provided an outstanding customer experience.   The design process was a true partnership – Justin and Jen were receptive to all of our feedback and concerns and worked on numerous iterations until we were comfortable with the design.

The building phase was smooth, efficient, transparent, and actually fun with Vinny leading us step-by-step through the process.  The highly detailed planning led to minimal surprises throughout the project and therefore few unexpected, but required change orders.   Of course, with a project of this size, issues did arise.  However, Vinny and the JRP team took accountability and just got right into problem solving mode until any issue was resolved.   That action alone, removed a great stressor from the entire process.  It truly made us feel like we were partners.  We were extremely pleased with the quality and craftsmanship of the work, as well as the coordination of all the subcontractors required in the early building phases.

The entire JRP team is extremely talented, professional, hard-working, thorough, willing to go the “extra mile”, and especially good-natured, fun and family-friendly!  We love our remodeled home and would highly recommend them for any remodeling projects.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The talented design team worked to truly understand our taste, and goals for our master suite and hall bathroom remodels.  Without their expertise and assistance in selecting the right details and design elements, we never could have narrowed down the infinite options available to us.

Grant, our project manager, was on top of every detail and ensured that we (as homeowners) didn't have to worry about our home or the workers who tirelessly and VERY professionally accomplished this mission.  Grant  was exceptional, both he and Justin earned our trust and confidence from the very first meeting.  Grant and the JRP team managed the various subs and support staff to make sure the job got done right the first time, minimizing the inevitable surprises in big remodels.  Grant always made time for our questions, no matter the issue, detail, or time, and our happiness was an obvious priority from start to finish.

We LOVE our new spaces and look forward to our next opportunity to continue creating our dream house with the help of JRP!

We have used JRP Design for multiple projects over the years: first, the complete remodel of our master bath, then two other bath remodels, plus recent construction due to fire damage.

Justin came up with some great ideas for our first project, and did multiple modifications until we were happy; it was a major redo. All of his team are excellent craftsmen: professional, meticulous, and polite.

The two project managers with whom we've worked: Grant and Vinnie, are calm and pay great attention to detail. In fact, they're perfectionists, finding at times small items that needed fixing that we did not; at others, being completely in agreement with us when we needed something fixed.

They and their associates are adept at all types of projects. If you're looking for a company that does great work with strong attention to detail, then you should contact JRP.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>We recently finished a house remodeling project with JRP Design and Remodel. What started out as a desire to update our kitchen and change out some flooring, turned into a wonderful “mini” home makeover. With the guidance of Jennifer and Corey, the JRP design team, we were able to create a beautiful new kitchen and install new flooring throughout the house, both of which blend seamlessly with the rest of the house decor.  The design team focused on making sure every decision, down to the hinges, was perfect and exact before the construction even began. Grant, our construction project manager, his JRP crew and all the subcontractors were so professional. They made living in our home while the remodel took place very manageable. Our kitchen was done for the holidays just as promised. We are absolutely thrilled with the end product!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

We are so thankful that we hired the JRP team to handle our complete home remodel.  We had interviewed several other contractors before working with JRP Design and Remodel, and within five minutes of talking with Justin, we knew that this was the team that could deliver what we were looking for with our home.  Every step of this process has been a first class experience.  We love how our design team, Justin, and Laurie, were mindful to combine their innovative and creative design concepts while understanding our family’s needs, lifestyle and budget.  They also have a finesse of merging my wife and my different tastes to seamlessly achieve a design that we are both excited about seeing in our home.  Their detailed renderings created by their in-house designer were so helpful to visualize and perfect our collective visions. The JRP office team has kept us on track throughout the entire process thanks to their organized accounting and tracking of our allocated finances.  Our project manager Vinnie has made this experience as stress-free as possible thanks to his constant communication and accessibility, excellent care of the job site and the professionalism of all of his employees and subcontractors. In any major project, things come up, and it is how those challenges are dealt with that separates people, and in that regard, Vinnie gets our highest praise.  The collective can- do attitude and integrity of the entire JRP team has allowed us to feel very confident in the outcome of our project and to enjoy this amazing adventure! Thank you JRP for making our dream home a reality!</text>

<review>Thank you JRP for transforming our small guest bathroom into a bright new space.  I'll never forget Justin saying "no job is too small for us" when I stopped by their showroom to see if they would be interested in taking on our "small bathroom" remodel.  The whole process was a great experience from the design phase with Laurie to the project phase with DJ and his various crew.  Everyone was professional and worked very hard to meet a fairly tight deadline to accommodate our travel schedule.  One thing that resonated with us is that JRP is a family business and it definitely makes a difference when you put your home in their hands.  Thanks again for a job well done and we hope to engage your services on other projects in the future.</review>< Rate>

Justin met with us regularly as we discussed architectural design, selection of gorgeous building materials, and creative ideas and storage solutions for every room.  His open concept transitional design surpassed our imagination. Our 350 sq. ft. addition, kitchen relocation, new bath, and additional 2 bathroom makeovers led to a fabulous whole house remodel, inside and out. Laurie's color and design sense added to the transitional flow through the house. For the duration of this two phase project, Justin and his experienced friendly work crews provided excellent craftsmanship, worked everyday which included daily cleanup. There were no problems with city inspectors.  Supervisor, Vincent, is very knowledgeable, personable, and managed sub contractors well, keeping things running smoothly.

Phase Two, our hard scrape, patio trellis and landscaping were just completed. Neighbors out for their constitutional cannot stop praising us on how fabulous things look on our corner lot and thanking us for raising property values in the neighborhood. Another quality JRP project completed. The vision for this endeavor exceeded our dreams. We live in a stunning new home, surround by outdoor beauty; perfect for entertaining family and friends.

With this top shelf team, there were no problems, only solutions. We love JRP and you will too. Trust Justin, he's always right about the finished look!</Review>< pictures>

We’ve worked with JRP on several major projects over the years and we keep coming back because we know that when the project is completed we will be happy with the outcome.  Justin, Vinny and the crew are really good at what they do and they take care of their customers.  Whenever issues have come up which they inevitably do, JRP has always stepped up and done whatever is necessary to make things right.  They have stood by their work and even helped us out in a time of need when it wasn’t related to a JRP project.

If you are planning on a home remodel, I highly recommend JRP.  You may be able to find a contractor that will give a lower price, but as they say, “you get what you pay for”.< /review>

<Date>1514313449939<//Date><Text>The owner Justin and his foreman Vinnie did a spectacular remodel for me 4 years ago.  They put in a totally new kitchen, fireplace, all doors and windows, changed the configuration of the master bedroom, 3 new bathrooms, bookcases, roof, add new closets and more.
I was so happy with their work that two years later I rehired them to totally re landscape my back yard.  They also built a completely covered outdoor kitchen with fire place, outdoor TV, covered sitting area and putting green.
The quality of their work is unparalleled and completely organized and efficient.</Text></record>

<text>Not to be lazy, but I guess I'll just repeat my Yelp review...

They did our roof, added three great sky lights... painted the outside of the house... and took our horrible looking,white whatever the heck it is garage door and did that great, brown wood-like, faux finish.  That added a lot of curb appeal right there and gets us many compliments.

They also did a beautiful stone walkway to the front door, redid that door and all our outside doors and added a pedestal light to the front and some cool light fixtures.

The guys are always professional and on time... and if there is anything off they come back to fix it or touch it up... so the warranty is key!

They stayed within our budget and what we agreed to and gave us great craftsmanship and value.  I just wish we had the cash to re-do the kitchen, as Justin showed me what it could be... Sigh... Another time for that.  In the meantime, I would definitely recommend JRP!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>We began with JRP remodeling our master bath 6 years ago and were very impressed with the quality workmanship and work ethic. We then completed a remodel of a second bathroom and update of our home’s second level, again using JRP. We could see more improvement in attention to detail.
Then, three years ago, JRP completed an entire remodel of our first level, including an addition of square footage to our kitchen. We didn’t think the quality of workmanship and work ethic could be any better, but it showed in our beautiful new kitchen, living room and family room!
Now, we are in the process of building a new home In another state. Justin offered to look over our plans for us, which he did, and suggested improvements. We did implement several of his suggestions and are very grateful for his input.
We highly recommend using JRP for your next remodeling or new-build project!<//Text>< date>

I highly recommend Justin, Lori Lynn and Vincent.  After meeting with many designers and architects, we hired JRP to renovate our kitchen and bathrooms.  It ended up being a wonderful decision and I have never second guessed the choice.  They have always been very honest and upfront with what is possible, how long it will take to accomplish specific goals, and are transparent about costs.  Furthermore, they always cleaned up after a hard day’s work and I could not be happier with the results.  JRP also completes projects on time or as close to on time as possible.  I truly endorse them without reservation and I will not hesitate to choose them with future projects.< /Text>

JRP Design remodeled my kitchen and three bathrooms and they did a fantastic job!  I was very happy with the final results.  They were quick to respond to any questions or concerns and kept me informed about the process along the way.  I would highly recommend JRP Design & Remodel (and have to many of my friends and colleagues) to anyone looking to redo a home.< /Review>

<text>I used JRP for a major redesign and remodeling of our main residence. We called them because we saw that they were doing a lot of work around our neighborhood. What sold us was the fact that they would handle everything, from concept, to design, to engineering, demolition, building and construction, permits, etc.: essentially, one company responsible for absolutely everything.

The job wasn't simple. It entailed an extension of half of our house, and a complete redesign of the interior of this half. It was essentially gutting this area entirely, first and second floor included, extending it and entirely remodeling the inside, electricity, plumbing, dry walls, floors, lighting, appliances, doors and windows, pretty much everything.

First, we loved the new design. Justin, his architects and designers used the space intelligently to create exactly what we were looking for. Work on this new design went on for about 9 months. We lived in the other part of the house while this was going on, which was a bit uncomfortable, but Vinnie and his crew were so nice and so competent that it really wasn't all that bad after all.

We would meet with Vinnie on a regular basis to supervise the progress, answer questions, make last minutes decisions and provide important feedback. I can't say that work finished on time as promised, because it didn't. But I have to say that they went as quickly as they could under the circumstances, and most importantly, they worried more about the quality  of workmanship than rushing to meet a deadline.

The finished product was close to perfection. A year later, I must have called them a handful of times to fix problems, which I consider minor, and they scrambled to get it done every single time.

In addition to that, they are all real nice people that you love to talk to and hang out with. I couldn't say enough about how good these people are.</text>< UserId.>

<Review>I was lucky enough to have JRP design and build me a set of custom built in cabinets for my living room and entertainment center and I could not be more happy with how they turned out. Everyone that comes to our home comments on how beautiful they are. While the guys were on site they were neat, efficient and friendly and I would refer this company for something as small as my project to as large as a whole home remodel. They can literally do it all.

On a side note, I work with JRP on a professional level very frequently and I know they have a very well run business. Justin the owner leads his team of qualified employees with his right hand man Vinny doing a phenomenal job at managing their projects out in the field. These guys are the hardest working guys you could ever meet. They work endless hours to make sure their jobs run smoothly and the client is always happy. I have yet to find a client that would not refer them after their job is complete. Because of their work ethic they also get a lot of repeat business from happy clients.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>We hired JRP in May and are midway through phase 1 of our complete home remodel. We interviewed several companies before hiring JRP and couldn’t be happier with our decision.  My husband and I love Justin and the insight he brings to the project. His design team is great and always has several options for us to consider until we have just the right fit.  We’ve found that everyone on the job to be courteous and professional. They do a fantastic job of keeping the worksite clean and are very respectful of our space. As phase 1 for us is an entire downstairs remodel!!!
We are so excited to see the complete transformation of our home.  JRP came highly recommended and we  have since recommended them to several of our friends.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I interviewed three other contractors for my remodel, and though JRP was not the least expensive, I believe you “get what you pay for”- I did!

I met Justin and Lori at a Boys and Girls Club meeting where we had been invited by mutual friends.  My friends had used JRP on FOUR projects and were very pleased so I figured that is as good a recommendation as anyone could want. I liked Justin and Lori right away and both were very easy to talk to.

I had a Tudor house built in 1979 that was showing signs of “wear and tear”. My husband and I were the original owners and it was definitely time for updating this “dark” Tudor. I wasn’t sure what I wanted and was “blown away” by the design the team came up with. To Justin’s credit he suggested that I just do the downstairs (of my two story house) first as he knew the project was overwhelming for me. My husband had died two years prior and I was not used to making all these type decisions alone.

Once things got under away and I saw that I was not “alone” I decided I would do the entire house.
Some of the meetings going over plans were exhausting and invigorating at the same time. JRP always had snacks and Hershey’s kisses to keep me going. Justin’s assistant, Corey, was terrific and helped me make decisions and, in her very tactful way, held me to them as every choice I made seemed to be just right in the end. Vinny and Jeff were my project managers and both were fantastic! Both were easily accessible and accommodating. Towards the end it was just Jeff that took care of the final details and he was so attentive and seemed to go out of his way to make sure I was completely satisfied and happy! They all feel like they are my friends! The workers were so nice, neat, capable, and polite. Diego dropped everything if he saw me and thought I might need to talk.  (Is there anything Diego can’t do?)

With JRP it is “one stop shopping” and that takes a lot of the pain out of a remodel! I love my new, light, bright, state of the art kitchen and would not change anything in my rather contemporary house. Its still got a traditional feel though no longer Tudor. Rather than list it right away I have decided to stay for a while and enjoy it.  It was worth the time it took to complete!

Thank you JRP!

<text>I have done a few remodeling projects with other companies, and JRP is by far the very best! We recently decided to remodel our master bathroom. I spoke with a few other remodel companies and when I met with Justin at JRP, I knew he and his team were the right people for the job. They have an innovative approach and one that makes great sense. You begin with a designer who listens carefully to your ideas and desires. A 3-D design is prepared and shown to you so you can actually see what your project will look like. It is amazing! This really helps so much. The next step is to work with the designer to pick all your finishes and fixtures etc. Once that is complete, the project begins. Because JRP gets the design and drawings and products taken care of before the project begins, you don't have those last minute urgent requests to "pick out tile" or whatever it might be. The project flows very smoothly. I had a once a week meeting the project manager, Vinny and he kept me up to date with what was happening and if I had any questions at all, he was more than happy to listen and help me out. The people who work for JRP and their subcontractors are considerate and respectful. They clean up every day and take great care of your home. All workers arrived on time and worked diligently until the end of their day. Our master bath is beautiful and was completed several weeks ahead of schedule! We did not have ONE complaint. JRP is a joy to work with. Everyone knows a remodel project can be a real test of patience, but working with JRP was easy! If I have any future projects, I wouldn't hesitate to use JRP.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< time>

JRP is an outstanding company.  Justin, Vinny and team do amazing work.  I have very high standards and they continually exceed them with quality work and innovative design.  We have had them do four projects for us, both indoor and outdoor, and they have transformed our home into one we truly enjoy living in.  You may find a contractor that is cheaper or one who will promise a job done more quickly, but you won't find one that will do better work that stands behind the results for years afterwards.  Highly recommended and we will be discussing project five with JRP sometime next year.</Review>

I used JRP for a complete downstairs remodel, including removing a wall, raising soffits, remodeling the fireplace, new floors, cabinets, new windows, and on and on.  Justin made it all fun and did the most amazing job.  He has a great eye and didn't let me make any mistakes.  I don't usually write reviews but have to now because he did such great work.  I'm a big fan and I recommend JRP without any reservations.  Also, they're big supporters of the Alzheimer's Association and I respect that big time.  Doing great work and giving back to make the world a better place.  Thanks for both, Justin and Lori.</text>

JRP was there to help us after the Wosely Fire. He originally built our deck 8 years ago, unfortunately it was fire damaged and had to be taken down and  rebuilt.   For the second time  we  have a beautiful well built  deck<//Text>

We highly recommend Justin and his team for any remodeling project, large or modest, indoor or outside.  JRP Design & Remodel is a professional company with talented craftsmen.  We have received countless compliments on the custom cabinets as well as the tile work and overall design created by JRP.  We absolutely love our new master bedroom and bath!

We are grateful to JRP and their beautiful and well-crafted work.  During the process of our remodel Justin spotted considerable water damage and rotting within a major supporting wall.  Justin's eye for safety saved us from a major disaster.  Following Justin's recommendation we rebuilt two decks.  We have not had any leaks since.  We would trust Justin with any project.  He is fair, professional, knowledgable and truly cares about his clients.</review>

We recently completed a major family room remodel with JRP.  Our project included a 100 sq ft room addition, new sliding door and changes to a structural wall.  We interviewed several contractors before starting and chose JRP because we had confidence that they would finish the project on time and on budget.  Overall, we were very satisfied with the entire JRP team and can’t say enough good things about the quality and timeliness of their work.

Our project manager (Vinny) was the ultimate professional and knowledgeable about all aspects of the remodel.  Unlike most contractors, he was friendly, provided regular updates and was always responsive to our questions.  The on-site construction crew including painters, electricians and  carpenters were also hardworking and kept the job site clean.

Overall, we would strongly recommend JRP if you are looking for a combination of high quality work and friendly customer service!< /text>

< review>
We have just finished a three-room renovation with JRP, and we are not only thrilled with the outcome in all three rooms (kitchen, powder room, laundry) but have been extremely pleased with each and every step along the way, from initial design through finishing touches.
Starting with the design process, we knew we were in good hands. Justin and team came up with ideas we'd never thought of but also heard us out on our own priorities, however idiosyncratic. Their expertise shown throughout.
Any renovation of an older house will most likely face structural surprises: JRP rolled with every punch, and even the most unexpected revision resulted in only minimum delay. There was not a single day during the four-month project that we didn't have active work going on, ie no down days or workers who didn't show up.
The house was left better than broom clean each and every afternoon. And with each new phase – from structural underpinnings (plumbing, electrical, etc.) to cabinetry, appliance installation, painting, floor refinishing, tile work and more – we felt like we were dealing with not just craftsmen but artists, such was the level of care the crews put into their work.
Our Project Manager, DJ, was on site nearly every day and was always available by cell for any question, no matter how small or redundant. We can't have asked for better workmanship or oversight and are very glad we selected JRP.< /review>

<Review>After deciding it was time to totally remodel my home, my next task was choosing a contractor. I am so glad I was referred to Justin and JRP Design & Remodel. From the initial meeting, I was impressed. Justin and his design team completely captured everything I wanted ? and beyond. The construction crews were courteous, exceptionally clean, and highly skilled; the Project Manager made sure that every aspect was organized and ran smoothly. My project was done on time and under budget and any minor issues that I needed addressed were taken care of quickly and thoroughly. I absolutely couldn't be happier with the results of my home renovation and whole-heartedly recommend JRP Design & Remodel.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1625609789656, 'text': 'Mary,\n\nThank you for entrusting our team with your home.\n\n-Lori Pecikonis'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

After years and years of dreaming, saving and imagining my new kitchen...I finally pulled the trigger and made the decision to go for it.  I will say upfront that I am not a big researcher when it comes to comparing companies and collecting bids.  When I find something I feel comfortable with - that's it.  I had seen JRP trucks around and had a suspicion I would be hiring them before we even met.  My intuition was absolutely correct.  I have rarely been so completely happy with someone I have done business with - and I've been around a while.  I have read some of the comments by previous clients and agree with every one of them that raves about Justin, Lori and the team they have put together.  I hope to comment on some of the things that maybe weren't mentioned.
After looking at pictures of previous remodels they had done and meeting with Justin...a concern was actually - would they take me on as a client?
Most of the homes that I saw were big beautiful North Ranch / Lake Sherwood type homes and I love my home but it is a regular Oak Park sweet little house.  He assured me that they treat every project with the same excitement and attention to detail - he genuinely seemed excited to help me and I never felt slighted or "less than" once.  Although I had in mind exactly what I wanted done - I was walked through a very thorough process from design - picking absolutely everything from paint color to sink to counter tops to grout consistency and flanges (?) - to being able to see a 3D rendering of my remodel on a screen from every angle possible.  By selecting and deciding the details up front the project manager was able to order everything needed prior to installation so that it is ready and waiting for that day.  No excuses about something not coming in or the manufacturer was out of whatever or waiting and wasting days for a part to come in.  Every single day someone was at my door at 7:30am ready to work - and work they did until 5pm.  Although it is an unpleasant and disruptive process to go through...JRP made it as comfortable as possible - setting up a temporary kitchen in my home office with my old refrigerator and micro-wave.  The work area was completely sealed off with zippered plastic tarps to keep down the dust and at the end of every day it was swept and as clean as it could be with all tools put away.  I trusted my team completely and didn't worry at all leaving them in my home while I was gone.  Each and every tradesman was professional and kind/courteous and an expert at their trade.  Now that the remodel is complete I find myself just staring at my beautiful new kitchen (and fireplace and guest bath and office and balcony/deck)  - so happy with everything and smiling until it hurts.  I can't wait to have JRP remodel the rest of my house.
Here's a nod to my Dad who used to say that you can trust and count on a guy with a clean white truck.  Right on Dad!</Review>

< review>
What separated Justin and JRP Design from the other three contractors we interviewed for our complete interior and exterior home remodel was Justin’s superior design and vision for the space. Justin’s unique ideas allowed us to transform this older, outdated home into a more modern, open floor plan. The ability to actually see his plan on the big screen at Justin’s office prior to the project beginning took all the guess work out of what it would look like after the project was complete and allowed us to make changes before the work began.  JRP designers help you pick out flooring material, cabinetry, finishes, etc. so that it all comes together at the end.

Our current open floor plan, transitional kitchen with a giant island is the envy of the neighborhood. And true to his word, unlike other contractors, when any issues arose after the project was complete Justin and his team were there to makes things right.

It is with the utmost confidence that JRP will do a great job that we recommend Justin and the JRP team for any of your home remodel needs.

We have used JRP for many projects over many years, over time remodeling our entire house except for 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms (so far).  Major kitchen remodel moving walls, utilities/appliances, etc.  Stairway with custom iron railings, entry doors, flooring, custom fireplaces/mantels, and more.  They execute superior quality work, providing high-end results that meet or exceed the most demanding expectations.  We would use them again and recommend them highly.< /text>

We used JRP Design and Remodel to do extensive work on our house in Westlake Village that was built in 1987. It needed a new kitchen, new guest bath, floors throughout, a deck, and numerous other projects. We chose Justin and his group because of his very reasonable time line and prices, and loved him because they stuck to their timeline and did fabulous work! I was very impressed with all of his staff, from the carpenters who built the kitchen cabinets on site, to the painters, to the electrician and the plumber. They were all nice, trustworthy, and did great work. Not only was the workmanship superior, but they have followed up with us on a (small) punch list without the slightest delay or complaint. I would, without hesitation, recommend JRP to anyone who wants great work done at a very reasonable price< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We recently completed a major kitchen remodel with JRP (all new floors, raised ceiling, new appliances, updated layout, moved pipes, new cabinetry…the works – existing kitchen was ripped out to the studs).  We’re very happy with the results and the way that it was managed.  Can’t say enough good things about the owner, Justin, and our project manager, Vinny; both were extremely professional and reachable anytime on their cell phones.  When we had a problem, they fixed it, no questions asked.  As with any project, there were opportunities to clarify expectations and they handled those with a high degree of professionalism that is often lacking with contractors.  We highly recommend JRP and will use them for our next remodeling project.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>JRP did a whole house remodel for us in 2014-2016. We had used them previously when they exclusively focused on kitchen and bath remodels. We had been happy with them when they remodeled our kitchen. And when we hired them subsequently to remodel a new home for us, we found that they were much more proficient on the interior than on the exterior. We were among their first whole house remodels as I recall. After we moved in, we discovered lots of shoddy work on the landscaping install (many of the plants died), the irrigation (which was not up to code), exterior doors and windows (a very expensive accordion door was installed inside out, as determined when the manufacturer inspected it due to it leaking) outdoor pergolas (which we had to repair lest they collapse) and - most significantly - the roof.  The roof had some low spots which we brought to JRP's attention. They blamed green wood used in the original construction.  Wrong. The problem has gotten much, much worse in the past 5 years, so bad we hired a structural engineer in 2020 to inspect the roof.  He determined that JRP applied roofing materials that were too heavy for the structure. Since the repair entails removing both the roof AND interior ceilings, this would have been good to know when we had the house torn apart. When we bought the issue to JRPs attention they claimed no responsibility and said we could hire them if we wanted the work done. Now we are looking at needing to move out for two months and spend some $75K for the repair.</Review>< Pics>

<text>After waiting 10 years to remodel my kitchen, I was lucky to find Justin Pecikonis from JRP Design and Remodel. I read many reviews and was very impressed by what his customers had to say. Justin came to our house within a week of my first call and after 10 minutes, we were completely sold! He made excellent recommendations to maximize our budget and resale value of the house. We had about  $500k worth of ideas of things we would like to do and about half if that to actually spend. Justin really helped us narrow the scope to fit our budget.

Ultimately our kitchen remodel grew to a much larger project and we couldn't be happier with the result. JRP installed a balcony on our second floor, removed windows on two floors and installed beautiful wood sliders - all of which required engineering and permits. They took our kitchen and family room down to the studs and replaced the flooring and baseboards on the first floor - this was a BIG project.

From beginning to end we have been so impressed with the professionalism and quality with which Justin and his team performed this project. We spent well over $200k and feel we got every penny's worth. If you are looking for a Designer/contractor / remodeling company that offers exceptional quality, has a team that is professional, courteous, and the cream of the crop in terms of skillsets...you should contact JRP. I am amazed that they did absolutely everything and minimized the inconvenience to us (as we lived in the house throughout the entire process). We never had to worry about permits, inspections, or any of the details that go along with a large remodel - his team handled everything. The design team and Justin K (our Project Manager) were exceptional and consistently responsive from beginning to end.

I am so excited to share the beautiful results with my friends and family. Since we are in the last few days of finishing, I will post pictures of the work he completed, you will be amazed by the transformation.

The best compliment I can pay to JRP is that I am already saving my pennies for the next project on our home...we will most definitely return to JRP for all future projects at this house and beyond. When you find someone this good, you hold on tight!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Rate>

We asked JRP to execute a rather large and complicated project within our main residence while we stayed living in the home. They did a great job, handled the unavoidable hiccups like pros, and completed the job within promised timeframes. They’ve been back a few times, at our request, following the completion to fine tune a small issue here or there and have done so as they promised in the beginning. We will continue to use JRP and the team!

<text>Delicious chicken quesadillas! We saw burritos being ordered by others and those portions were huge!

Highly recommend this place. It’s just before gate 64, but even if that’s not near your gate, just walk over there, it’s totally worth it!< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-Ag30k2pCgy00_vzTL0vx5n1IvpDiJzB_frPg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4prfD-in523sF2BPW4jbMVBfTFuVVpwKoqSET=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSbZIK1wEmYN0aHV9-5sk13vCdWsVbuzAlTqM8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_PlYb7UOvwrJAnsSiaD2-4rW9jP3_uRtaBmg3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdZc6glg5qjJ0de9EzmMVlB3zXYQw0NiFI3LPt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

Wow, yummy, yummy, yummy! We ate here both times we fly into SFO on our trip to Oahu (3/15 & 3/20). We loved it so much! The cilantro rice was my fav! Polite service & prices very reasonable for an airport. Loved it!< /Text>

<Review>Gave it a shot, solidly meh. Yeah it's perfectly edible if you're craving a burrito, but seems their strategy is to make it spicy enough so that you're just thinking about how your mouth is on fire rather than how it's under-seasoned everything is.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Massive tasty burritos!  There were 4 of us and 3 of us decided to get burritos.  All three were monster size.  And they were really tasty!!!  I'll be coming here for sure.  Probably the biggest burrito I've had in the last ten years.  No joke.</review><date>1572021308775</date>< userid>

Chipotle-quality experience with a happy hour combo special on draft beer 5pm-close.  5 or 6 handles, including local beers on tap. Reasonable prices for airport food - almost real-world prices during happy hour. Best looking food in Terminal 3.</Review>

Cause I can’t give it 0. Worst airport food I have ever had. So incredibly unnecessarily spicy. I like spicy food but this stuff is level 10 with zero flavor. Also cartridges leak everywhere, which is the worst possible thing to have happen when you are constantly moving in an airport and getting on a plane. Worst experience I have ever had in an airport getting food. If I weren’t already on the plane, I would have said this to their face.</text>

<review>I don’t recommend to eat from there!
The service is okay without the cashier actitud that is not polite, plus the food was not good,  the chicken was fishy and the cashier charged me 1.35 dollars extra. I paid Almost $15 for a burrito that wasn’t worthy!</review></record>

I would have to disagree with the majority of the negative reviews here. Firstly, the customer service was not bad. Definitely no worse than the majority of burrito places I've been to... And I've been to MANY. Secondly, in regards to price. Yes it's more expensive than the average burrito joint OUTSIDE of the airport. But it is the airport. To put it in perspective, a chicken burrito will normally run you $8-9 outside the airport. Here it costs $11. Sounds about normal to me for an airport mark up. And lastly, on food quality, it's a mediocre burrito. Not bad, not excellent. But if you like burritos, you won't complain. It beats some $@## food from burger king. Happy burrito eating!<//review>

Best breakfast burritos west of the Rocky Mountains. Your choice of meats are bacon, chorizo, and ham unless you want to go in for the kill on a Pork Chile Verde or carnitas burrito for $2 extra. Vale la pena!<//Text>

<Review>Their tortillas and guacamole are vegan, so this was the best option I could find for vegan food in SFO terminal 3. Quick, pleasant service and a huge, tasty burrito at reasonable price.<//Review>< Pictures>

Average burrito, taco, and breakfast shop in the San Francisco International Airport located near gate 65. Food is reasonable, nothing special. Prices are typical San Francisco Airport which means hi.< /Text>

< Review>
If I could give less stars I would. I ordered a burrito with sour cream and guac plus a small water and the total was $19. With that being said, the burrito was bland and the rice was undercooked. I expected a first class burrito for $20. If your looking for good food, keep walking. Taco Bell would be better than this for a tenth of the price.</Review>

Food is OK. Charge $0.50 for corn salsa. The burrito comes with (per the menu) meat, beans, cheese, and salsa. Oh, but not corn salsa. Seriously?  For $12.65 for a burrito, I'd think corn salsa wouldn't be an issue. Their definition of salsa is "pico/tomato" only.
I love their receipt which has the "suggested tip" table at the bottom. Yeah right.</Text>

<Review>It's a bit of a struggle to give out 2 stars here, but it was technically food and they were . . . efficient . . . through the process.  Still, the food was way overpriced, even for the airport, and it wasn't good.  Like really wasn't good.  And that efficient service was anything but friendly.  It may look good, like Chipotle or Qdoba (one of those is still questionable), but it isn't.  I'd have to try the other places around this terminal, but I'm betting most of them are better than here.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Decent burrito. HORRIBLE customer service. I asked the guy behind the counter to mix my burrito's ingredients and he clearly ignored me. The cashier was better, but clearly had a "I don't want to be here" attitude. Time to purge some of the crew, or management if they are the ones making these people so miserable.< /Text>

Well, this place is pretty bad. The servers look annoyed that they have to make your food and the prices are somewhat high (as expected given it's in an airport), but the one-star clincher is that the food is just no bueno.<//review>

<Review>Flight was delayed and needed some food. This was the closest place to my gate.

Seemed like a Chipotle knock-off with the portions being MUCH smaller, but more expensive.

Got a veggie bowl. As I said, portions were SMALL, but prices were HIGH.

Food was decent. The rice was a little harder than I'd expect, but it served it's purpose.....feeding me before a 6 hour flight.< /Review><user_name>Tamara Y.

Insane price in San Fran Airport - $18.70 for a Burrito Bowl and a large water. Insane. They took a month and a half to charge my Corporate Amex, and the best part is they charged me twice! For business travelers this is an expense report nightmare.<//text>

The bacon burrito was actually pretty good, the salsa will sneak up on you later in the form of hersery squirts. But the place really only needs one thing, queso. It's kind of shameful to sell burritos and tacos without queso.</review>

<review>Wow... if you’re going to be a Chipotle knock off, at least try to improve it (not a hard task)! But this place is so bland!!! I couldn’t even get through half of it....<//review><username>Brett Poteet</username><time>1549334810869<//time><gmap_id>0x808f779182f83855:0x9b8bd8db3b653f6c</gmap_id>< rate>

Ridiculously surly staff that TRULY hate their jobs. Wow. Lots of yucking it up and curse words in spanish ( like I don't understand ) with each other but like zombies with customers. Was asked twice what kind of meat I wanted on my chicken burrito ! Just read the reviews about food poisoning and double charges and wishing myself luck. Its no wonder they don't have a website, but it is a wonder that they have a contract to sell in SFO. Wonder what it cost them...<//Text>

I got the carnitas burrito. The carnitas was full of fat and I couldn't finish it. My friend got the steak and it was also fatty. This place tries to mimic Chipotle and does fairly well on taste but fails on quality.<//review>

<Review>Card chip didn’t work, neither did the card slide (even though I definitely had money on there)
I had some cash, but was $3 dollars short to pay for burrito
The Asian lady refused to give it to me, even though it was already made
I went to Burger King after that and my card worked
Pretty heartless place< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>My favorite stores are Nike, Adidas and Crate and barrel.  It needs more healthy organic, vegan restaurants. Christmas time was decorated really pretty with the World’s Tallest Tree! It was amazing to see it up close.< /review>< Rating>

< Review>
Went here specifically for the vans outlet store. For decades they have had discounted vans buy one get one 50% off!

Got myself two pairs of the same nebulous blue and white shoes because I haven't seen this color in vans since I was in middle school 20 years ago..

Got my wife 2 pairs of shoes,  black pair for work the multi color for whatever.

All 4 pairs $139. ! What? I know it's a steal.

Very good customer service as well.</Review>

<text>This is not a review about the outlet. But there are two guys who run a taco stand there. It’s so good. Make sure you get the extra hot sauce. Thank me later. Pay them in cash and add some tip.< /text><user_id>115956668707503240521</user_id>< pictures>

Great place the shop for nicer items at a fair price. I stop there on the way to and from San Diego for Starbucks coffee and a walk around the mall. I usually end up buying something</text>

Great shopping experience!! I love the deals one can get at an outlet mall. This place is well designed and offers lux places to spend a little dough or cool off with some shopping therapy! The Bathrooms here are very clean so kudos to the team. Have fun and also enjoy the good eats located close by. GOD Bless!!< /text>

This place is a nightmare, especially on the weekends. Too crowded, lines to enter the stores. Why even bother, just shop online.<//review>

We haven't been back to this outlet for many years because when we first visited it, it has only few stores we liked. Now, they can compete with other bigger outlets. They have most of the stores you normally see from other premium outlets.< /text>

<review>This outlet has Adidas, Nike and Under Armor, my three go to stores.

The Adidas store seems like the discounts are way better than other stores, you can get shoes anytime for $25-$40!< /review>< pictures>

Small and clean outlet with many brands like Lacoste and Polo RL. Variety of stores from restaurant to small café. Nice to spend time there during the weekend.</text>

Pandemic? What pandemic? This place was crowded. It was curious to see that every shoe store had really long lines of people waiting for their turn to enter the store. The wait time quoted to my wife to enter The Disney store was 60 minutes!

Can't wait to see what the theme park will be like, ticket availability and prices, if Newson ever allows Disneyland to reopen.

We drove our EV from Aliso Viejo and was pleased to see they have numerous EVgo charging stations. Thanks to Nissan, we topped off our battery for free while enjoying a Blaze Pizza.

A lot of the stores were shuttered or had Reopening soon signs. Brook's Brothers was open, didn't have a line and everything was at least 40% off, which was good since that's the main reason I drove to Carlsbad.<//text>

Beautiful outdoor mall. Quite the collection of clothing and shoe stores. We have our favorite stores, but just about anyone should be able to find what they are looking for.

Dining options are a little limited. Ruby’s Diner is a nice option though. Great desserts!

Getting in and out can be an issue. A little secret - if you are expecting crowds, DO NOT use the Palomar exit. You’ll avoid some stress and probably save some time using Cannon or Poinsettia. Get off Poinsettia and then take Paseo Del Norte right to the mall.  Exit to the north and use Cannon to get on the freeway.<//review>

If your looking for bargains this is the place to be! It's an outdoor outlet mall so even during Covid-19 you are able to shop. Some of the more popular stores do have lines waiting to get in, but they seemed to move at an average speed. There are so many different types of stores to choose from, but id say the majority are clothing stores. Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Feragamo pop up store, J Crew, Guess,Theroy, 7 for all Mankind, Joes Jean's, Lucky Brand, Levi's, Old Navy Kids, Tory Burch, Kate Spade, Micheal Kors, Coach, Vans, Nike, Adidas, Puma, Swarovski, Crate and Barrel and Sunglass Hut are some of the stores with amazing deals at the Carlsbad Outlets. They all have heavily discounted merchandise that's in style and for what I consider to be a steal. I defintely recommend checking out this outlet mall... Especially for Christmas shopping!<//review>

<Review>Parking was terrible, they had big selections closed off, no sign as to why. They also had most of th bathroom stalls locked off, also not sure how or why that would be needed even with social distancing. But otherwise it's a decent outlet mall with pretty good stores.< /Review><userid>112890766185935352363<//userid><rating>4<//rating>< gmap_id>

<text>Heather and Emily, staff at Michael Kors were extraordinarily helpful and made the experience for the exchange students visiting from China feel welcomed & took the extra time to help them pick out the perfect gift for their parents back home who are celebrating Chinese Lunar New Year. This was especially hard to be away from them and this really made them feel cared for and special. They also helped me pick out a gift for my best friend who just had a birthday. The sales prices were definitely worth the trip and they have smart watches with the ability to scan a code for a China compatible android device. The Nike store was worth mentioning as well. We were able to get an entire athletic outfit for under $40.00. The staff was also respectful and was attentive. We also went to Kate Spade and the sales prices were amazing. The best by far and the products are high quality. They seemed a bit understaffed though for the volume of visitors though. The staff did a great job handling the rush. Very impressive experience. I especially like that this outlet center has designated parking for veterans...so, I was able to find nice parking without the hassle or worry of an acceptable and accessible spot. They do honor military with a discount although not every store honors it. I’ve learned that in passing. Overall I give this experience a 8/10 and 5 stars for today’s visit. I’ve been here multiple times over the years. Good job and shout out to the management of this outlet!< /text>< Pictures>

There’s little train that kids can ride on for $5. The bathrooms are clean and big. Usually no wait times at the bathroom. Will return.< /Text>< pictures>

Had a wonderful day walking through the outlets. Most of the sales people were friendly and helpful. Went a little crazy at the Coach store. Found a beautiful leather briefcase at Wilson's Leather. I was very pleased with all my purchases and my savings. I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Carlsbad, California.<//Text>

Nice outlets. Although I don’t like the practice of certain stores saying they have a sale just for the weekend I happen to be there, just to keep the same sign up year-round.<//Text>

It was a beautiful rainy day and I enjoyed it very much. Got a great price on some running shoes, had one of the best meals I've had in a while at Ruby's, and felt like I didn't even touch everything I wanted to see. This has always been an awesome outlet mall and continues to be.</Text>

Great variety of stores, products, food and services. Definitely something for everyone can be found here from delicious chocolate desserts to actual food. Luxury hand bags wallets, Eyewear, shoes and even some clothing although Barney's New York proved to be one tier too high for people's budgets I guess. Ruby's Dinner is awesome too.< /Review>

Nice outlets. Although I don’t like the practice of certain stores saying they have a sale just for the weekend I happen to be there, just to keep the same sign up year-round.<//text>

Love Tory Burch but I cant shop with very persistent sales attendant following me and offering everything im looking at. So Kate Spade is by far the most wonderful store to go in specially they have 40-70% off for grand opening!< /text>< pictures>

<review>It was a beautiful rainy day and I enjoyed it very much. Got a great price on some running shoes, had one of the best meals I've had in a while at Ruby's, and felt like I didn't even touch everything I wanted to see. This has always been an awesome outlet mall and continues to be.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Visited other outlets and there are some good collections overall worth a visit.

Location seems a bit far from San Diego city nevertheless worth the drive<//text>< Pics>

Good prices and all the major stores have a presence here. Nice open air layout, and in a nice/scenic part of town. Parking tight during peaks, but manageable.</review>

<review>I like shopping at Carlsbad Premium Outlets. It is big. There are lots of medium to high-end stores, several chain eateries, and clean bathrooms. The plazas are maintained immaculately, which is difficult given the crowds.

Prices can be quite good during sales. The active military is given additional discounts.

Parking is free, although the lot can be quite full. Lots of benches and shade. There's even a train for the kids to ride.

Everything is ADA compliant.</review>< pics>

<review>A very nice mall to walk around and find some good deals. They have a little bit of everything. Food choices are not to bad if your planning on eating there. Parking can be hard to get at times. The spaces also run on the small side. You also get a really nice view of the flower fields when they are in bloom.<//review><Name>Nicholas Powell< /Name><resp>None</resp><UserId.>105424689977385408613< /UserId.>< Pictures>

This is one of my favorite outlet malls especially for visiting the Kate spade store as I am a huge collector and I always seem to find clearance Kate spade items that are her specialty line towards the back of the store. This is a quaint outlet mall with very good stores and deals. I should also mention that it is very well kept and clean.<//review>

Loads of great stores, mixed with good eateries...  Good deals to be had all around.  This outlet has been around since some time in the 1990's and has been very stable, which is testament to some ongoing management quality.</Review>

<Review>I love the outlets.  They change shops every now and again which makes for nice surprises. It's beautiful there and s great place to walk around after a snack.  Disappointed that Bellefleur restaurant was replaced by a store.  Beautifully decorated for the holidays.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dc72fb37895853:0xb4f60b7ac07956f2</GmapID>< date>

Love these outlets! Great selection of stores ranging from children's to adult clothes, sunglasses, designer bags, food, etc. The sales and discounts are usually pretty good. It's an open air mall. There are some kid rides and a mini train that is fun for the kids to ride. You will have sooo much fun. Lots to do here!!!< /Review>

The property is well maintained as an outdoor venue, lots of food spots and generally just great for a stroll.  You'll tend to get good deals on the merchandise because it is an 'Outlet' location, selling discontinued or older version goods.  But it's all great quality stuff from some of the top brands in retail.< /Text>< Response>

<text>Good values. Pro tip: ask the sales associates in the stores if they have merchandise from their retail stores. Some have items that have not sold in retail, so it is sent to the outlets.

Love these outlets! Great selection of stores ranging from children's to adult clothes, sunglasses, designer bags, food, etc. The sales and discounts are usually pretty good. You can also capitalize on holiday weekend sales in top of discounts. It's an open air mall, so it's best to go when the weather is nice. There are some kid rides and a mini train that is fun for the kids to ride.< /Review>

Love shopping at all of the amazing places like Kate Spade and puma. Great place also to eat. They have great place for restaurants as well and snack food from carts. I love the ice cream from Ruby's. Very family friendly and they have some fun things for young children to ride on a train or on an animal.<//Text>

A big outlet that contains the famous luxurious fashion brand names with very attractive prices.
You got to spend a lot of time to search wonderful items with good selling chances.< /text>

We shop here often. There are so many stores that you're pretty much guaranteed to find what you're looking for. Often there are terrific sales too. However parking is often impossible. The lot fills up and you can spend quite a long time driving around looking for an empty space.< /review>

<text>We visited on the evening of Thanksgiving on our way back from visiting friends for Thanksgiving dinner. We thought of just driving past but couldn't resist stopping after learning about several sales. So we pulled in and the place was packed! We had to wait for people to leave and follows them to get parking. The sales were phenomenal! Many stores had 50% off and we took advantage of the sales. Clark's are one of our favorite shoe stores and we ended up buying 5 pairs of shoes - all 50% off! Major score there! We also were able to take care of some Christmas shopping. Great deals, convenient location that easily accessible from the freeway, and a clean and safe shopping center. Plus awesome sales frequently throughout the year. This place is one of our favorite shopping centers.< /text></record>

<Review>Great place for great deals, though not as good as a Macy's or JCPENNEY sale...still,  very nice. Most upscale shops can be found here but service is not like the major brand stores; i.e. Nordstrom,  Bullock's,  Macy's,  etc. You will be 90% on your own to find the best deals.<//Review>< user>

The only dislike I have about this place is the parking but that's to be expected. The stores around here always have decent deals so its worth making a trip every once and a while. They have a pretty good selection of restaurants to choose from as well.</text>

Last time I visited was for a Cars and Coffee on a Saturday morning, which has moved. There is a wide variety of very nice stores, including  Srarbucks, Ruby's Diner, Tumi, Brooks Brothers, Coach, Polo, Ecco, Calvin Klien, Cole Haan and many more. I came especially for the Tumi Store today and wandered through the mall and into a few stores.  It was pleasant and relaxing and I plan on returning very soon.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>The outlet malls have a good amount of variety. For those that are into fashion there are plenty of great stores to choose from. When I was there the Kate Spade store had a line going out the door. There must have been something really good going on inside. At any event so many different alternatives and the sales make it worth the trip.</Review>< username>

<Text>This outlet mall is the best outlet in San Diego county in my opinion. With great access to Legoland, they have every store and yummy places to eat you could want in any shopping day! Great sales when applicable.</Text>< user_name>

<Review>Basically has every store you need from traditional casual items to high end clothing. Plenty of food places to pick from as well and you're not far from the beach in the event you want to take a drive near the ocean. I will just give caution the parking can be hectic, especially during holidays. There are many areas that are easy to get into accidents or hit people so drive carefully.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<text>Good location, quite central compared to other outlets. I have liked most of my experiences here and have found great discounts at create and barrel and kate spade but the parking is difficult and food options are not great. Would suggest that the outlet consider a more high end food court or eatery center.</text></record></dataset><record>

There is a wide variety of stores and they all have good deals. They also have plenty of regular priced merchandise so not everything is a deal.

There are some good decent food choices, fast food and sit down restaurants.</review>< Pics>

A bunch of overpriced outlet stores! I guess lots of overseas tourist like to shop here because of the name brand stuff they can take home. Always busy and crowded. Interesting place to just sit and people watch.</review>

< Review>
An obligatory shopping stop during the holidays and most will find something here, but not my favorite outdoor mall.  Incredibly crowded during the holidays and summer as the "outlets" title brings no shortage of bargain hunters but beware, there are some great deals but also an equal amount of full priced items.< /Review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>I love shopping here! My favorite shops are Le Creuset, COACH and Calvin Klein. It is an Open Air Outlet Mall (not to be confused with a Strip Mall) located just off of the I-5 San Diego Freeway. It has sidewalks and plazas as well as sit down dining. They provide ample parking; however, the stalls are very narrow, during the holidays you will find it challenging to find a place to park, Valet Parking is available, and there is more than what ADA requires the facility to provide as it relates to Disabled/Handicap parking (which is a HUGE +). The restrooms are always clean (there are 3 locations)  they have several stalls to choose from, including Handicap/Disabled stalls, and there are changing tables for babies. There are Electric Vehicle charging stations on the East side of the mall. They have a Nursing Mother's Lounge. Security. Stroller rental. ATM Machines. Complimentary Wheelchairs. And the evenings and early mornings are less crowded</Text></record></dataset><record>

This is a personal favorite that I make a point of stopping at whenever I am in the area.  They have a really great Brooks Brothers store there that is always worth a browse.  The Starbucks location right across from the Ruby's Diner is a great combination, especially for breakfast.<//Review>

<Text>Low security!

I really love the shops and the selections they have.
Probably the best Polo Store I have ever been to.
You will find more sizes and selections than OC outlets.

Been there around 7:30 and parked the car in the outlet’s parking and when I was heading out I found my back glass broken and a backpack stolen!!
Took us a while to find a security! Which was of no help anyway.
Cops were around, turned out 3 other cars had the same incident.

There were no CCTV in the parking lot, not a security guide.<//Text>< Pictures>

An obligatory shopping stop during the holidays and most will find something here, but not my favorite outdoor mall.  Incredibly crowded during the holidays and summer as the "outlets" title brings no shortage of bargain hunters but beware, there are some great deals but also an equal amount of full priced items.</text>

Nice mall.  The outlet stores have alot more selection of the brands you really want.  Just for shoes, they got Adidas to Vans.  You can check out the same pair of Converse,  in 5 or more colors.  Very casual dining.  It is an outdoor mall, so more areas with shade and benches would appreciated on those hot days.<//review>

< Review>
The stores are apparel focused.  Great mix of mid to high end brands.  The deals often coincide with holidays, which mean crowds.  Plan to arrive early.  Otherwise, parking is nightmarish unless you are willing to pay for valet parking.  Overall, good shopping experience and selection of stores.  Recommend!< /Review>

The only store that wasn’t welcoming was Fashionphile (100D) they had a decent selection, however the only person that spoke to me was the security at the front door. This is disappointing, I wouldn’t have minded adding to my duffle bag collection.Smh</Text>< pictures>

<text>We love visiting the Carlsbad premium outlets. It's a family friendly outdoor shopping mall with most of the shops you'll need for the entire family. The only reason I am not giving a 5 star is because of the parking. It is almost always over crowded, and its difficult to find parking spaces.<//text><rating>4< /rating><Name>Daniela Solis<//Name>< gmapID>

The outlets are a good place to shop.  The venues that I shop (Lucky Jean's and Vans) always have great customer service, and sales that benefit the trip better than I imagined the trip to be.  Today I went to pick up some Jean's for my brother, and walked away with Jean's, a button sweater, a 4 day 3 night in Vegas and 5 day Cabo and Mazatlan cruise....all for $150.00!!  To say the least, I left with a smile<//Review>

<review>I get to Carlsbad outlets when it’s time for new dress shirts. Just white. Ok, sometimes a stripe shirt when I’m feeling really bold. Been bargaining at Brooks Brothers since forever. Bought a belt there in 1906 just before WWI and it still looks new. Ok, may I’m off a hundred years or so. But Brooks Brothers will last you till it’s time to visit the Goodquill.</review>< Rating>

Very nice outlet, but wish it has more stores. I always have to stop by Michael Kors when I come here. I usually buy their dresses and blouses here for work. They also have casual clothes here that I also like. The girls that work there are very helpful too. Check it out!<//review>

The mall is not very big and only has few good stores to shop at but it does have some of the popular brand stores found at most outlets.< /text></record>

<Text>Definitely the upscale Mall in the area. This place is nice and it's great to take your kids in the stroller or even your dogs if they're well-behaved. Don't be bringing your crazy mutts around. Have a bunch of different kind of restaurants ranging from snack foods to sit down meals. And all kinds of shops.< /Text>< user_name>

<review>Parking is easily available for me all the time. Maybe because I visualize and really feel there will be an open spot as soon as I get there. Works every time. Anyways, the outlet has a great atmosphere, and Is always filled with some interesting tourist; stores are well organized and welcoming. Personally the best part for me are the  Good vibes, cute girls and clean bathrooms!</review>< GmapID>

It IS super busy. So much to see and visit. Very popular. Popular for good reasons. We visited Create and Barrel, to find they are no longer a full C&B location - only filled with overstock, discontinued and one-of. Bummer, but we enjoyed walking the aisles.< /Text>

<text>The outlets are a good place to shop.  The venues that I shop (Lucky Jean's and Vans) always have great customer service, and sales that benefit the trip better than I imagined the trip to be.  Today I went to pick up some Jean's for my brother, and walked away with Jean's, a button sweater, a 4 day 3 night in Vegas and 5 day Cabo and Mazatlan cruise....all for $150.00!!  To say the least, I left with a smile</text><Response>None</Response>< date>

Good selection of stores but parking tight during holidays and like most outlets really not a good selection of restaurants unless you leave the property. Fortunately, San Clemente outlets is open and thus no need to drive the extra 30 minutes each way.< /Text>

<review>Love this mall, not so much the parking! To find parking here is insane! Last time we went we took about 25 minutes looking for parking. People are in such hurry to find a parking or to get out of there that they forget manners... If you go, be ready to go on a scavenger hunt for a parking space.<//review>< pictures>

This place is great. There's a huge variety of stores with amazing sales going on year-round. There's a nice fountain where you can sit down with the option to charge your phone at the new charging posts.  If you are a people watcher like myself, you will appreciate the diverse crowd of foreign people on any given day. The Carlsbad Outlet is a popular local attraction for families and business men/women visiting southern California.<//text>

Bestest one stop shopping. Prices vary depending on what you are looking for but for the most part reasonable. Clean restrooms, Great atmosphere. Out of all the outdoor malls I've been too, Carlsbad Premium Outlets is by far the prettiest. People ate not rude.</review>

<Review>Those Zoo Animal Ride things are an unbelievable nuisance. Watched a girl (who looked about 12) run into an older gentleman with a cane and knock him over. The girl stopped, never got off, and never helped him up, other people did. This all happened right in front of the booth where you rent the animal scooters, the girl that worked there did nothing either. Lawsuit waiting to happen.<//Review><response>None<//response><date>1564350606527< /date><username>Jenna Clark< /username><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80dc72fb37895853:0xb4f60b7ac07956f2</Gmap_id><userid>108076419338252273708</userid><rate>1</rate></record>

Great place to snag designer items. I always go for the Clarks outlet but usually walk around finding other things. If you go once a month get the savings pass it's helpful! The mall is located behind the tulips which is a gorgeous backdrop and you're minutes away from the beach.  Nice place to shop in Carlsbad. If you go on a busy busy weekend parking is crazy otherwise I've never had a problem<//Text>

This is a great outlet mall.  It hasn't been there long I think it opened last Christmas.  Plentiful parking and a lot of high end stores with great discounts.  They've had live music there on the weekend.  They have some restaurants there with stunning views.</Text>

Don't go on holiday weekends as parking is very tough to find.  Lots of tourists and eager shoppers looking for a discounts.  Otherwise one of the better outlet malls in San Diego.<//review>

Honestly a really cool and very convienant outdoor mall. I would highly recommend going here if you are looking for something to do in your spare time. They have all the popular locations you could want. definitely needs more recognition and hope this mall doesnt go anywhere :)< /text>

Those Zoo Animal Ride things are an unbelievable nuisance. Watched a girl (who looked about 12) run into an older gentleman with a cane and knock him over. The girl stopped, never got off, and never helped him up, other people did. This all happened right in front of the booth where you rent the animal scooters, the girl that worked there did nothing either. Lawsuit waiting to happen.</Text>

Great place to shop with good deals since it's a outlet center.  Only complaint would be the parking was terrible.  They do have valet parking if you don't mind paying.  But besides that had a pleasant time there.  Flower garden is right next to the center.</Text>

Parking is totally insufficient for the crowd the outlet brings. I was asked where the bathrooms were twice my last visit because the signs pointing toward them may not have been clear enough. Its clean and well kept.<//Text>

I am still exploring all the shops and need to go when I actually plan to go so have more time. Enjoy finding nice, quality clothes at reasonable prices and so far have been happy with shopping here. Even bought my first red sweater at banana republic - that's a big deal to add this piece to my wardrobe. Parking is horrible though, don't drive around just wait in one spot is better.</Text>

We enjoy walking the mall. There are always some great sales and discounts to be found.  The whole mall is dog friendly so we usually bring our boxer.  She comes with us into the stores and often gets treats from the sales people.<//Review>

You really have to dig for actual competitive prices. They layout can be a bit confusing as well.

The WiFi is made so that you're subscribing and giving emails to various vendors, not a single network for the entire venue. Annoying.

Wasn't worth the travel for savings unfortunately.< /Text>

The set up was very nice. Shoe stores in one section, purses in another, clothes in another, kids in another, and food in another.
I feel like it could use some more variety with clothing shops, as there are very many pricey clothing stores it's hard to really buy anything. I purchased a Dooney & Bourke purse and some Puma sneakers while I was there for some really good prices. Definitely a great place to shop at.</text>

<Review>This is the best premium outlet to shop at, you get great pricing, and it is a beautiful mall to shop at. Not only that but I was impressed with no smoking, no cigarette butts any where on site. Parking can be a problem as this place is pretty popular on weekends go early or stay at home, or bring lots of patience.
In the area lots of great places to eat.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Love that this place makes it a fun place for families. A lot of little rides for little ones to play. Very hard to find parking though so I suggest going about two hours before close.  Recently some stores have been closing making the place look a little depressing.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Oh how I love this outlet. It has a lot of the stores I love to shop at. The prices are really good. They're always having sales on already great prices. Parking is usually a pain, but that's only cause it's such a great place that everyone and their brother shops there. : ). I've never had an employee in any store be rude or neglectful. So proud of our outlet!< /Text>< pics>

This outlet mall is a huge joke. Everything is the same prices you would pay in store.  If that doesn't bother you, then you might enjoy it, but do not go expecting to get any deals. You are better off shopping online.</Text>

This place has a nice interface that helps you find items quick and easy. Also, the sales staff here is very helpful. Michelle was helping me find a youth soccer ball for my son and went above and beyond to help me after finding out they didn't carry it in the store. Thank you!</text>

This is a nice outlet mall at a good location. The store selection is varied but parking can be bad. Some stores have really good deals that are better than a typical mall but for others it is better to stick to the mall.</review>

Love that this place makes it a fun place for families. A lot of little rides for little ones to play. Very hard to find parking though so I suggest going about two hours before close.  Recently some stores have been closing making the place look a little depressing.</review>

<rating>4</rating><review>This mall is so much better than SY next to Mexico border.  But it is step down from the one near palm springs but it is a better occasion.  The parking is a challenge.  And the management should clean their public bathroom.  It stinks like the SY Mexico mall.  It would have 5 stars if their bathroom were better kept clean.  Hey come on.  Everyone has to use the rest room eventually.< /review>< pics>

For a Premium Outlet Mall, it has a good variety of shops at a less then premium price. Good place to walk around. Not that many eating establishments but has a couple to satisfy some people.< /Review>

As with all outlets, either the products are full price high-demand objects or they're seconds or discontinued products. I usually go to the Adidas store for the clothing deals, and have gotten some good clothes at good prices. There are lots of different brands in the mall and parking is especially tough on the weekends.< /text>

There are also some great restaurants and places to snack here if you need a break from shopping. Parking can get insanely busy during the summer so give yourself some extra time to find a coveted spot. The fountains have sadly stopped running because of the drought.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>A nice place to stroll about even if not buying anything. A few places we love here are BASS they have good shoes, great pricing specials. Rubies dinner is hard to beat - hamburgers are likely the best you have tasted in a while. There is a Starbucks here that always is crowded. The Polo shop is loaded with your ubiquitous Polo shirts that are more a classic than quick changing fashion, still expensive so don't think you are getting any deals at this outlook. I notice a lot of languages spoken by patrons here, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Russian and who knows what else? Tourist love this outlet mall near the Pacific Ocean.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

And "Outlet" to have "Outlet" Pricing. Its crowded with normal priced merchandise. If you ever travel across California. Grapevine Tustin Outlets beats this outlet across California. I can say the least. This one is the last place of outlets. Even San Yisidro and Viejas outlets seems to be better priced. The parking lot gets crazy. And your car may get dinged. Be careful!</Review>

When you are near San Diego visit the outlet. This is not to big but you can find awesone stores. A lot of clearence. I has been visited This mall for 15 years. The mall shows new stores ofrenda. There are restaurants in the mall or crossing the Street. The parking lot is free and safe.< /Review>

Fun outdoor factory outlet mall that the teenagers love because of their marked down prices and people with brand name tastes.  Also it is by the flower fields when they are blooming in Carlsbad and they have special free concert events.< /Text>

<text>It’s a small outlet, it doesn’t have as many stores as Las Americas. Also they don’t have many stores for young people, they used to have Papaya but it’s now gone. Everything else is expensive and not very fashionable.
Parking can be a big pain there, it’s always too crowded and there is not enough space for so many cars.
Also, they only have one coffee place (Starbucks) which is very small and it’s always too crowded. It doesn’t have much place to seat outside (and nothing to sit inside).<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dc72fb37895853:0xb4f60b7ac07956f2< /GmapID></record>

Obviously since it’s outside it gets very hot especially walking all over parking is very crammed and not much variety in stores in all honesty you’re better off driving 10 minutes north to the Carlsbad mall for AC and much more stores and food options<//Review>

Come with a healthy wallet although if you shop well at the right times, you can find bargain deals for high quality merchandise here. Plan to circle around a few times for parking during peak hours. If you don't want the hassle you can park right accross the street and cross the intersection to get to the shops.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This outlet has some of the best stores around Carlsbad, Oceanside or San Diego at a great price everything nearby in walking distance and very very good prices I was really really surprised at that all around 5 Stars they even have restrooms in walking distance ,stores in walking distance restaurants in walking distance car dealerships in walking distance ...<//review>

Great place to shop, with plenty of bargains to be found. The only downside is that at busy times, such as the holidays, there's not nearly enough parking for such a large mall.

Nothing more frustrating than to have to spend 20 minutes cruising-around with dozens of other wanna-be shoppers, all acting like vultures the instant someone is spotted getting into their car.< /review>

<Text>The outside of the Mall looks nice bathrooms are very accessible but the stores are very small and it's a headache finding parking if you come here on a weekend you better come early because the Outlet parking lot fills up by 11am and you will be driving in circles for an hour until you find a spot if you are lucky. And the Valet parking has one third of the parking lot blocked off. And  I also noticed stores like Nike and Adidas don't have a good variety to choose from. You are better off driving an hour south to Las America's outlest in San Ysidro not that they are great but the outlets are a little bigger and better that carslbad. And yes I said an hour because with traffic you won't get from Carlsbad to San Ysidro in 45 minutes.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Rating>1</Rating>< response>

Outlets have pretty much become a fad and the places in the outlets are either the same price as normal stores, or they make special, cheaper merchandise to sell in the outlets.

<review>Good selection of stores. It is best to visit during the week to avoid the crowds. There is a few options for food including a Japanese fast food (which I highly recommend) I was able to find my favorite brands including Reebok, Bose, Nike, Under Armour, Gap, Ralph Lauren, Asics, Clarks, and Disney Store.</review><user>111920511179917274423<//user>< time>

The parking here can be a mess on busy days. Stores are good. Over all, they dont have enough bathrooms( one os closed forever now) and parking. There is no good place to sit down and have a beer unless you go across the street to BJs. They need to make a better place where the husbands can hang out.  They need many more EV chargers they only have 2 for this entire mall.</Text>

<Review>It's a nice outlet mall, they have good deals in all the stores, but my problem was always parking ! Now they have solved that issue by installing a new hand car wash called Lotwash, they detailed my car and parked it for me it was so convenient to shop have lunch and then come out to a clean car the guys did a magnificent job😊 I will definitely continue shopping here not only for the savings but for the great Carwash< /Review>< rating>

We made the mistake of going up there on the weekend. Don't waste your time on the weekend. You'll wait 15 to 30 minutes to even find a parking space if you're lucky and the place is so crowded. You'd be much better off going during the week. It's not a bad outlet center but I've been the ones that are much larger that have a lot more shops in them. This is located close to Legoland as well as the flower fields and that's why there's so much traffic. Lots of families are there.<//text>

Parking here soured the entire experience. The valet had the signs out but were full. There was literally no parking. If it's at all busy, just go straight for the street parking. That said, we got what we needed. There's a good selection of stores as well.<//text>

<text>Very popular outlet mall. It's part of the "premium outlet" group, so if you're familiar with them, you'll have an idea of the types of stores. My favorites are Carter's, Brooks Brothers, Le Creuset, Ecco and the soft pretzel store.

If you're making a day of it, there are some good casual lunch options which are all conveniently located in the same area. There are also a few full service restaurants across the street.

Parking can be challenging during popular times. If you can get there before 11:00 am on week ends, there should be ample parking available.< /text></record>

<user>107966002656882049530< /user><Pics>None< /Pics><review>People love this outlet mall. There are lots of stores and bargains, and very close to restaurants. However, parking is a nightmare and it's absolutely crowded every weekend. It's still crowded during the week, just not as bad. Most people in San Diego and OC have heard about or have been at this outlet mall. If crowds don't bother you, then this is a good place to go shopping.</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_name>

<Review>Stores and deals are great! Lots of options and sales. They lose a star for their parking situation though. I may have just been there at prime time, but I literally drove around the lot for at least 20 minutes looking for ANY open spot. There were NONE. I ended up having to valet. Rip off. Get a bigger parking lot and/or cut down on the space you reserve for valet.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rating>

My wife and I went there for maternity clothes, which major department stores have stop carrying. We didn't really explore the outlet to much. The parking is a bit of a pain, no one really pays attention to the stop sign. You would have to shove your way in and hope no one hit you. Plus the car next to us left their dog in the car, it 83 degrees in the shade.<//Text></record>

<Review>The deals here over independence day weekend were to die for and there were so many high quality stores packed in such a good little mall. The selection of things was great, the customer service at every store was quite helpful, and even if they weren't having a sale, these prices were too good to pass up.<//Review>< pics>

Love Dooney & Bourke. Traveled to California and remembered CPOC has an outlet store so I made it a point to visit and was not disappointed. I actually made two trips while in CA. Lovely store with wonderful prices. Will definitely patron the store when in CA again.<//Review>

People are so greedy with parking here. Parking spots are too small (hence people park like jerks) and this place is a nightmare during any holiday throughout the year. Some stores are better than others but there's nothing special about the place.</Text>

My favorite and go to place for quick shopping . I like to browse through kids stores, lucky jeans , Calvin Klein, Tommy hilfigur, Ralph Lauren to name a few . I also frequent Starbucks/ Rubio's/ Godiva / haigen Diaz depending on what I need .easy parking .bit upscale compared to The border mall but within city if you are in coastal SD or north county inland<//text>

<text>Not as big as San Ysidro but still a nice place to shop. Theres a few restaurant but It would be nice if you have more options for dining. In spring time, you can sneak into the flowerfields after you done your shopping or vice versa.< /text>< name>

< Review>
I gave it a 3 star because several stores are going out of business or are already closed. I come on vacation here and bring a empty suitcase to shop.I favorite the Ecco shoe store it is closed. When asking ones going out was told rent doubled. Was looking in the carter, oskgosh, kids stores the deals where not there. Offers at the information booth coupon book for discounts with a AAA card. Outdoor outlet mall,  easy to find, clean bathroom and large in size. Michael Kors had great deal on purses with a extra 50%off. Awesome staff. Lucky jeans buy 1 get 1 50% off plus 20% off in coupon book. Those where my finds. Off to next shopping outlet mall still room in suitcase.</Review>

Great strip mall right next to the flower fields and Legoland. Most of the stores give pretty good deals, even in the off seasons. The only problem is if you come during a peak time (vacations/summers) crowding can be a pain.< /review>

This outlet mall has a good cross-section of stores, some that are very unusual, like Barney's and Kipling. The new Nike outlet is a welcome addition, so now people in North County don't have to drive down to Las Americas at the border.
There are the usual popular outlets like Gap, Lucky Brand, Tommy Hilfiger, etc. The smaller outlet stores tend to go out, like the now-gone Harry & David. If you are planning on a trip there, you should check online for the current listing of stores.
This outlet mall also has one of the best selections of food for an outlet: Ruby's Diner, plus King's Fish House and PF Chang's across the street, and plenty of fast food in the area.
Yes, the parking can be a pain. Stalking people for a space is the easiest, and come early if it's a holiday weekend, because it will be a zoo.</review>

When I think of an outlet mall I think of name brand stores with a big discount on items that have not sold. This is not what this outlet mall is. Don’t go looking for a good deal, it’s not going to happen.</Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>It had been awhile since I went to this outlet mall. It's still a solid experience.

There was a time when the outlet mall was an destination unto itself. You'd think nothing of driving halfway to Vegas, but not actually going to Vegas to visit outlets. That experience has died thanks to the internet.

But the outlet mall experience still has it's places, and those built at a destination that's near civilization will continue to survive, even if they won't thrive.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Nicer outlet mall that continues to grow. It is however super crowded on the weekends. You can park in the satellite shops across the street and just walk over.</Text>

The outlets in Carlsbad were so so. I wasn't all that impressed. However they did have quite a few different stores, but the prices weren't all that reduced I found. So it wasn't really worth it to go there over a normal non outlet store. we went at night so parking wasn't an issue. I don't know if it gets crowded on weekends or not.<//Text>

You can find some great deals there, however some stores over price things so it looks like you're getting a killer deal when you are really paying an average price for similar items elsewhere.< /review>

Vehicle was broken into  while sitting in the parking lot, under lamp.  No cameras, security guard on Segway stayed on sidewalk.  Nice place, just beware. Carlsbad police officer came, said this was not the first time this has happened.<//Review>

Good prices and several options, robust selection - I gave them one star because we got broke into our car in the parking lot. Beware and don't leave or unload your shopping in your car, there are thieves roaming around.< /text>

< review>
There is a large variety of stores ranging from quick eats, ie Blaze Pizza and Panda Express, to well known brand names, such as Coach and Tory Burch. Although I have enjoyed the frequent discounts and numerous choices of consumer products, some areas are lacking. There are always long lines at stores of well known brands, which is understandable.
However what I cannot accept is the costumer service. In multiple stores, in my experience, employees were very rude. At one time the employees were berating a customer who did not speak English. There was no patience and although the employees kept the talking to behind the scenes, it made me extremely uncomfortable and offended as I was stuck having to hear them speak this way towards multiple customers while I was in the changing room.
Overall my experience here was okay. Although I am reconsidering coming to this area as I feel uncomfortable with some of the employees working here.</review>

Good average sushi. Udon is under par; overly sweet and salty at the same time. Toro was of good quality.</Text>

PARKING SUCKS! If you are coming here on a weekend, prepare to fight for parking. I lived in Cardiff by the Sea which is maybe 15 minutes away. I have been here about 8 times within 1 1/2 years. If you come on a weekday, you will have no problem finding parking. If you are one of those people who get frustrated when you can't find parking, don't come.

Other than that, the outlet is very clean and has good stores. Whenever I go into any of the stores, it's organized. I can't say the same thing about Las Americas Premium Outlets in San Ysidro. Their stores look trashed like a burglar ram sacked the place! But not so at Carlsbad Premium Outlets.

The prices are okay, but not great. I recommend going during one of the popular holidays or after Christmas when there are many returns.

After you are done shopping, I recommend you take Pacific Coast Highway on your ride home. It's very close to the outlets.< /review>

Be careful when you shop at this mall when I was shopping with my family we left our car at the parking and we were victims our stuff was stolen from our car. Security not good at all and parking has no security cameras plus police showed up one hour and half later to make the report.</Review>

Good selection of stores, and ample parking. Outlet stores seemingly don't really have heavy discounts these days, but clearance stuff still can be a bargain.</Review>

There are many options in these outlet stores, they're pretty clean for being "outlets", and it feels safe in the area despite the low prices.< /Text>

Same bad layout as other outlets by the same operator. Outside of shops it's all outdoors open sky. No shelter when it rains. No place to stay warm when it's freezing in winter. Very few benches (outdoors only) to rest your tired traveling legs. Outdoors very poorly lit when dark.</Review>

If you're coming from Los Angeles, Anaheim or Irvine, you have closer outlet malls that is actually bigger and better than this one. Check Desert Hills, Ontario Mills or The Citadel.< /review>

It's a great place with a wide selection of brand stores but giving it only 3 stars because outlets are supposed to have discounted prices compared to their parent stores and this was NOT the case here.  Very expensive!!!!!<//review>

If you're looking for high-end stores like St. John, Etro, Maje, Ferragamo, Gucci, etc. these outlets are not the place. They do have your usual outlet shops like Gap, Banana Republic, Coach, Disney, Gymboree, Carter's, Ann Taylor, etc.<//Text>

Lots of new/improved stores there over the last year. The only complaint is parking during weekends, which can take a lot of time.<//review>

A nice collection of Outlet stores including most of the Premium brands like Polo-Ralph Lauren, Guess, Coach, Nike, Reebock, Kate Spade,  CK, Tommy Hilfiger, Gap, Crocs, Brooks Brothers, Under Armor, Banana Republic, etc. They also have nice selection of Food Places like  Ruby's Diner, PF Changs, Blaze Pizza, Panda Express, Subway, Motto Japanese and of course Starbucks Coffee. They also feature some Kids activities like Mini Train, Coroussel, etc. Ample parking but always a crowded location due to many Tour Operators stopping with Visitors from other countries. Remember to show your AAA or AARP card to get additional discount book from Customer Services Kiosk.  Happy Shopping.< /review>

I will not come here again.  Just go to your local mall.  Price point is about same.  Quality of products are subpar.</Text>

Great deals to buy everything.  If you have a AAA card, get more discount , all you have to do is go to the office to get the discount book before you start to shop.</text>

It's a nice open atmosphere for shopping and having lunch. Parking can be a nightmare during peak shopping times of year.</review>

<Review>After the Mad Max premiere last year, the sun-faded Charger bolt sticker plastered cars started to include screams of "Vahalla!" as patrons look for parkings spots in this sea of lost hope and despair.

After 25 mins of following that couple you think may be leaving and finally going shopping, your choices here range from the obvious (Gap, Crate and Barrell) to the odd (BBXDFADFDD?). They also added a Wetzel Pretzel booth for mid-mall snacking, although the pretzels come from the anchor store at the other end of the outlet and they frequently run out of pepperoni twists.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Response>None<//Response><review>Parking takes at least 45 mins on Sat and Sun.  30 mins if ur lucky.  Management of this place knew the parking problems for many years and has not done anything.  Now people have encroached lots across and adjacent to it that dont belong to the outlets.  There goes ur savings--$ for gas and emissions.  Who knows how many more parked at Costco.

Lots belonging to other establishments around this outlet should now seriously implement towing or make money for parking.

Seriously if youa re saying there are great bargains here then you've never been to San Ysidro, Cabazon or Citadel outlets.

(I know because I live close to Palomar Rd and we shop in all four outlets at least a month)

Save urself the hassle--the Las Americas in San Ysidro, and the Cabazon outlets are bigger, more shops, and more parking spaces.</review><user_name>Joselito Sucayan<//user_name><user_id>108206829228582321941</user_id>< Time>

Weekends and holidays - Parking situation is atrocious. ATROCIOUS. You'll circle the lot, stalking pedestrians for 15mins... then you'll abandon all hope and pay $10 valet parking. All for the pleasure of shopping with 10,000 equally frustrated strangers.</Review>

<review>This is more of a store specific mall not outlet. They have a ck store Nike store and so on but not much is incredibly discounted.  You can go to Macy's when they have a sale and get everything there cheaper< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< name>

I go to the outlets hoping to find good deals. Some stores are better than others. Inventory is usually limited and the best items are likely regular price. I do love how it attracts folks from all over the world. Announcements are made in several languages. My kids love Wetzels Pretzels, so a day at the outlets is never a bust.< /Text>

Although the shopping mall is small, it is convenient for dining, shopping and leisure. Love the clean environment and relaxed atmosphere here. But this time it was found that another shop was closed.

每次往返落城和圣迭戈之间，都会选择中途在这里休息一下。购物中心虽然不大，但是餐饮、购物和休闲，都很方便。喜欢这里干净的环境和轻松的氛围。不过这次发现又有家店铺关门停业了。< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCYYbtbwr9miJQVb0trZUvraUJb08RB4r1Nq_w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrTOonFEnckpeN16cNrXYClUr1H1wnOrO510L7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqIggBl_pbwXGiDIjAstQbJsCMWJ8BeeuI4QVH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHecBIPD2bWli0AtxIos4mbmqRiEtw9ntRuHrH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7L01A03cxi_tHlhuwqRQVSeyJVGvQBI7q57lA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZHmbYXUvLKGu2D7oo11ENNdhMe0KKqjSw4rnf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlvrLvGSY5fdgC6RNVtkcLnI65xb9Vz3OtJu8Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVubi_v5D3ieSxjVyTsjpunKnjJ7x9yTRn7oQO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX-Oblx_FQ64Q2SR775UgjY-cBOS9JKYOLZli9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcqFkwD171VeMUejZ6_29U-9B-q-95sl-thcPC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhwO4zCx-4qSKWptGQF3sJkUrWd2jCOknsV9I0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc72fb37895853:0xb4f60b7ac07956f2< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Calvin Klein is absolutely ignorant. The display of the wrong product and the price indication of the product may require a further payment in the calculation and the price of the clothes and the price of the calculation may be completely different. The manager and the staff were unfriendly to the customer about the mistake that they complained about the position of the shop unkindly. The manager was a very unpleasant woman. Here, Calvin Klein really shines. The products were not so varied and really messed up. I still do not feel good. And the outlets here are almost expensive. Of course, there are many cheaper ones, but most cheaper ones are 40% and 50%, so the original price is so high that discounts are not so much. Of course not all of the shops. There are many places that are kind and price is good. However, on next visit, Calvin Klein will not go again. It is like an impression that the employees are not doing well in the store as a whole. The general atmosphere of the outlets is pretty and nice. 
Calvin Klein seems to have no training from the manager to the employee. I was honestly also racist.

Calvin Klein은 절대 비추천l 입니다. 맞지않는 제품의  진열과 제품의 가격표시로 계산시 더 지불해야하는 경우가 발생하고 옷의 가격과 계산의 가격이 완전히 다르게 나올 수 있습니다. 그것에 대해 매니저와 직원은 불친절하게 가게의 입장이 맞다며 우겼고 뻔한 실수에 대해서 오히려 불친절하게 손님에게 대했습니다. 매니져가 참 불쾌한 여자분이더군요. 이곳에서는 캘진 클라인은 정말 비추입니다. 제품도 그리 다양하지않고 정말 엉망이었습니다. 아직도 기분이 좋진 않네요. 그리고 이곳 아웃렛들 거의 비쌉니다. 물론 싼것들은 있지만 싼것들은 대부분 퀄리티가 별로인제품들이 많고 40% ,50%한다고해도 워낙 오리지널 가격이 높아서 디스카운트해도 별로입니다. 물론 가게들이 전부 그렇지는 않아요. 친절하고 가격 괜챦은 곳도 많아요. 다만 다음 방문시에는 캘빈 클라인은 다시는 가지 않을것 같네요.직원들이 전반적으로 매장의 일을 잘 못하는듯한 인상이네요.  전반적인 아웃렛 분위기는 건물들이 이쁘고 좋아요.
캘빈클라인은 메니저부터 직원까지 교육이 안된것 같아요. 인종 차별적인 느낌도 솔직히 받았습니다.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXHGHtgUeA_UjFo3btImKEA2LRyCGcxKPJ8Pg-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEpbZ5SWeeN5Q_tpvT16On6rl8QsZHwa2DkD6h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNReXBErYrk-fX6MDxZRABjL2GUredXWreMN1Qp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNORIWDgCJSWZMgcak_n9QR6hOxH6FGLIsW9EsJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORSFZ3luNYvuMkfRBxdAGm8naNktH52WVWQdgX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuzio-YqA2ZexL_uAk7zB7MJqk4zjU4F_Z-Sey=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMynwBlS66yStrA3fLqIz0rJAja74puf5fCNhAl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdjGmEzeVHwgkJdbI4lVihtV0NMBT-wZGfwZLA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWPEWzIp0sVm0oF7ABq7u5HqFXtGgpNxV2bvBV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbR0xugGZOZGSO4nzGY0rWeyTVxt7Fqajy25Pe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPMZzkUKxeD7ugH4f6T5D3i4MTCNFYr3aDCMW4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSBwA73p56G4QCO4fxGA7CvEYgoCcwYOhtUjBE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNl9k_zHGLp3NlO_TSX9u9QFC08XEyIwhdiGJ9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwAgcBidtSOzRaG58QmRMkZ5lAnIQ2mRLqTpBw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNF5EazdKA_x2Su9ekmjpSUoUIsZV6UpmuX0z6l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuhvGsHLyHwxsQ0w__FoY4i7RbbJ15Zi3oBxpT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-bjEgxubYwATbpFvK8KJRHXWm8gXSjTa5RuNR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeBRNkrYuGick5Mlm9ep1udtfr-r7mrf_xzPUm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsJn_7qGb6d2XFEMfqFFHjObIclJvFXkzWc3Si=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT7AWwP8_dl4U1MW_oy5Ume2qsg9Qseev1fFMl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMx6wKr6rbJUhiAJDbLZ1yUXvvQ45MptwLsmpul=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2CVvHgrMZJhxY-niXkF2cQsV5FHM0Ls6-4LDO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzA3CoCMj1dmMFZtRUJwuZ4mcZVFxcID52m7n4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBPNQcKuXrW9DstiXLnKA8d3YKAUOXN8JtjpR5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ_iogga1dgw-AsW-TgpVYVxyjh0G8bBCjq6w1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNabkII0tpoxP80t6UIw9jQGNs0DnuS3wIl312U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVLfyzm4YKgjq4BxbO06sjgNNf0NC8yMm04Eg1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxRGN6pmDfaZuOGod9iLQIcVNUcM7HRfOhqZD2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1mG0LW_zq_jmtQpJeu2wpOxXh2BuwBqc3m2Vj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcjGk75tOkQcMgD7QwipKo6LLJKRH2_XGdKSVr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNR7Y00aaLn2T6JRRvWwqY5Yqj08Ck4cPGU3qhP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7zIuaR-xdZi-QaO-fuQga9pRr2YcOYRKnU9T-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOu4ryNUf_8_seOujyCwghAZhJCRxVFd-fThc-G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYm_plge732h_sMIxc1YPGNVoxzqNJS_2XxRwP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB2A6ySiJ4KtviMlfym9LsAVypp_ci6DcZdrdd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNtNQCNrwtl-y9zHfF_2ZzfYB77gFL2XIYZnS2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4PSGFKv_hWNAK4P_xyBw2SPQTrHzPJxe8W_XH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPu7vhWscg5XWhCcDDS-vGVeEtkxqvczPV-vYax=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBhRfnaeibJtODfjYaojdD5U9QvggvfhAfpNHZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPviJEs7Hgt_xukoUZ_Y57zMyCWVH06zOpckD1O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Others don't want to go shopping, first buy bags, although there are at least a lot of people in order, the service staff will arrange the bags at any time and anywhere, making people look, pick, and buy more comfortable!
When I pay the bill, I wait longer. It takes about 20 minutes ... There are many people buying. The waiting time is definitely necessary. It is rare to buy it. Please wait patiently!

這outlet比較小，全部逛完花不上3個小時！其他的不想逛，買包包先，人雖多至少有秩序，服務人員隨時隨地都會整理放置好包包，讓人看、挑、買的舒服多了！

(Translated by Google) The coach is always there.
Buy a folding umbrella.
This is a great souvenir.

The Outlet Mall in New Jersey was better (because clothes and shoes were tax-free), but it's also recommended because it's cheaper than buying it in Japan.

(Translated by Google) It was crowded even on weekdays. I wonder if Japanese people are happy to get into the bathroom right away.

(Translated by Google) It's about an hour's drive away from Irvine. It is operated by a company such as an outlet operated by Shinsegae in Korea, and the overall atmosphere is very similar. The coach is very cheap, and if you find a good store like Nike, you can do it. I bought it for $ 31 Air Max.

얼바인에서 차로 약 1시간정도 떨어져있습니다. 국내에 신세계가 운영하는 아울렛과 같은 회사가 운영해서 전체적인 분위기가 매우 흡사합니다. 코치는 아주 저렴하고 나이키 등 매장도 잘 찾으면 득템이 가능합니다. 에어맥스 31불에 샀네요.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) There aren't many stores. But if you have a specific store to buy, the outlets aren't wide so you can shop comfortably.

(Original)
매장이 많지 않아요. 하지만 구매해야할 특정매장이 있다면 아울렛이 넓지 않기 때문에 편하게 쇼핑할 수 있을것 같아요.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Quite a big shopping center. Built in the Californian style, ie. you walk down the street, and go to the shops in the premises. It may not be very convenient during the rain, but it should be tried to get to the rain. To get even more discounts, you need to register on the site.

(Original)
Довольно большой шоппинг центр. Построен в калифорнийском стиле, т.е. вы ходите по улице, а в магазины заходите в помещение. Может быть не очень удобно во время дождя, но это надо постараться, чтобы попасть на дождь. Чтобы получить ещё больше скидок, надо зарегистрироваться на сайте.<//Text>

<Time>1407043965749< /Time><Review>(Translated by Google) Calvin Klein is a favorite at the outlet here. The product lineup is more abundant than Japan, and the price is good. The size was still XS, but it was M to L in Japan. Check out the COACH men's shop. Outlet that you want to go to many times personally.

I like how large selection each shop has.And the price is also good comparing to these outlet malls in Japan.I personally like Calvin Klein, Guess, and COACH men's in here.I will come back and get some more before I go back to Japan.

(Original)
ここのアウトレットではカルバン・クラインがお気に入り。品揃えも日本より豊富で価格もお得感あり。サイズはやはりXSでも日本のM～Lサイズだった。COACHのメンズショップもあるので是非チェックしましょう。個人的に何回も行きたくなるアウトレット。

(Translated by Google) It's not the best outlet I went to, but it pleases me to be calm, beautiful and comfortable.
Some stores double the value of the merchandise and then give the supposed 50% discount. I don't understand if this practice is common in outlets, but I noticed this one.
Not far from San Diego, by car it becomes a beautiful ride.
It is worth giving a check.

(Original)
Não é o melhor outlet que fui, mas agrada por ser calmo, bonito e confortável.
Algumas lojas dobram o valor da mercadoria para depois dar o suposto 50% de desconto. Não entendo se essa prática é comum nos outlets, porém observei nesse.
Não muito longe de San Diego, de carro torna-se um belo passeio.
Vale a pena dar um confere.< /review>

(Translated by Google) It is a good outlet for shopping, however, it is somewhat small and the variety of stores is not so wide. Of course, there are higher level stores or more pulling premium, for example, for women there is Coach, Michael Kors and Tori Burch. For some purchases for which you do not have much time, it is a good option.

(Original)
Es un buen outlet para ir de compras, sin embargo, es algo chico y la variedad de las tiendas no es tan amplia. Eso sí, hay tiendas de mayor nivel o más tirando a premium, por ejemplo, para mujeres hay Coach, Michael Kors y Tori Burch.

(Translated by Google) Very nice premium outlet not far from San Diego on the coast. Very clean and well sorted. Located directly on Interstate 5. Again, do not forget to pick up the ViP Shopper Discounts. Very nice also the flower fields above the flowers themselves cut. Have fun shopping.

There are fewer parking lots than I expected, so it's difficult to find a place to park your car during busy hours.

(Translated by Google) The plaza is small, it has few stores compared to some outlets in San Diego, it has some food options.

In general the prices did not seem low to me, I thought that in the US outlet the prices would be much cheaper than in Mexico but they are the same, in Mexico if you find a good offer you can get cheaper prices in the department stores and from them brands, even on the internet you can find cheaper prices than these.
Maybe the good thing about these outlets is the black friday

La plaza es pequeña, cuenta con pocas tiendas a comparación de algunos outlets de San Diego, tiene algunas opciones de comida.

En general los precios no me parecieron bajos, pensaba que en los outlet de USA los precios serían mucho mas baratos que en México pero son los mismos, en México si encuentras alguna buena oferta puedes conseguir precios mas baratos en las tiendas departamentales y de las mismas marcas, incluso en internet puedes encontrar precios mas baratos que estos.
