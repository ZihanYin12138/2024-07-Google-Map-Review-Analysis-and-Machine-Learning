He is pleasant and has remedied my beginners problems with tips from the install of electronics to tips for preparing for flight to tips for being in flight.

I used Aquatic Aviation to purchase my flyboard for the first time and I am 100% pleased with the service and quality of my flyboard and accessories. I dealt with Paul through the process and he was there every step of the way and also gave me is cell number to contact him with any questions i had. Very pleased with the service and will defiantly by buying more equipment soon.< /review>

<Text>Just want to give a big shout out to the Aquatic Aviation team. Special thanks goes out to Mark who has been a great help in support, advice and quick responses. The process of purchasing and getting the equipment was easy and I was well informed of every transaction.  The Aquatic Aviation Team really delivers customer service. If you are thinking of starting a watersports business or just want a water toy for yourself, I highly recommend the Aquatic Aviation team.
Thanks so much guys.</Text>< pics>

Paul was an AMAZING instructor!!! We had a headset on while we were riding the flyboard and he gave us real-time critiques and if it wasn’t for that our experience wouldn’t have been half of what it was! We did the one hour private lesson and my husband and I both were able to get up on the fly board (our first try). Aquatic aviation is a great business, very organized and well ran. 10/10, highly recommend!!!!! Thank you again Paul!!!<//text>

This was my first time fly boarding. Had Shane as my instructor. And I couldn’t have had any more fun than I did. He was super cool to begin with. Very patient with you when you are first learning out in the water. And super supportive when you are struggling as well as doing well for your first time.<//text>

This was one of my best experiences ever. It was my first time trying the flyboard and it was so much fun. My instructor Hanna was so helpful and supportive.
I definitely recommend Aquatic Aviation.<//review>

We had a wonderful experience.  I bought this for 2 teenage boys as High School Graduation presents.  We are all still "high" from the great experience.  Both boys were feeling quite confident by about the 10-15 minute mark, making the last half of the 30 minute experience a chance to really "get it".  They are already talking about their next go.  Mark and team were awesome to work with and made sure we were happy with all aspects of the experience!  We really appreciate their going above and beyond to make it an excellent time.  I suggest coming a bit early as parking took quite a bit of time to locate.  Also, there is no shade on the end of the dock for watching.  Wish we had brought an umbrella.  Highly recommend!</Text>

<review>My Boyfriend and I booked a 1 hour private flyboard lesson, and we were extremely nervous yet hype to try this new sport! Shane, our instructor was nothing short of AMAZING :) he guided us through the entire experience and provided us with precise instructions/details to master the sport! Needless to say, we’re still novice after 20 minutes of attempting to be great! Lol Look for us sometime in the future because we’ll definitely be back!!!

Just had a class with Bruno. My girl and I had been wanting to try this for so long.
The guys Bruno and Mark were GREAT!!!
Good positive people and very patient wth us.
We had a blast and defiantly recommend this company if u were thinking of trying it. 30minutes was plenty of time to get up and do a few tricks. If you’ve snowboarded,skate or surf then this will be very much the same.
Thanks Bruno! You helped make this a fun experience.

<Review>Flyboarding is as fun as it looks and Aquatic Aviation provides an exceptional experience.  We had a group of 7 people, ranging in age from 20s to 60s,  and everybody was able to fly.  The instructors are friendly, enthusiastic and very good at teaching you how to get up and out of the water.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I had a 1 hour hover board session with Marc - absolutely loved it! Marc explained everything and let me fly and jump all the time how I wanted to. If you know how to snowboard, this is for you. Very easy to learn, but be prepared for some severe muscle pain after even when you are in good shape. It's an awesome experience, very different from wakeboarding or surfing - you can actually fly at your convenience!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Best Thing I've done on water in Years.  So easy, your mom could do it.  So fun, you'll want to do it again right after you're done.  Wow.</Text>

What an experience! This is one of the coolest things I have ever done! The feeling is like being a dolphin with the ability to fly!

They provide you with a wet suit and gear, all you have to bring is an adventurous spirit to have a good time! (and maybe some towels).

Mark was our guide, and definitely made the experience just that much better. He gives great tips on how to control the board (in a South African accent), and he loves it when you spray him with water (haha, jk).

Parking: It's best to park across the street in the residential area. There are no time limits and it's free.</text>

< Review>
To the OWNER of Aquatic Aviation,

The purpose of this email is to bring to your attention the phenomenal ambassador you employ for your business. My daughter bought one of your water boards for her fiancé’s for his 40th birthday. My son Dustin and I did the install on my Seadoo RXT 300 and experienced some difficulties. In the parking lot of the lake we reached out to Mark at Aquatic Aviation for help.  Mark’s genuine concern and assistance was beyond our highest expectation.  He tried to help us solve the issue and then researched “You Tube” videos we might find helpful. Since we were trying to meet a timeline of a birthday party his assistance was exceptional.

For my daughters birthday this weekend we decided last night to order the smaller boots for her. I called Mark and he walked me through the process seamlessly. Our order is guaranteed 2 day shipping and complete thanks to Mark.

Personally owning customer service oriented businesses with more than 140 employees I understand and fully appreciate exceptional customer service.  If I had recordings of our calls to Mark throughout this process I would utilize them for my staff to hear what “the best” sounds like.  I felt you deserved to know how impactful Mark’s service is.  We will be referring others to your business as they see our water board system because of Mark!

Sincerely,< /Review>

<Review>I've been shopping here periodically for several years. It's always clean & the staff is always friendly. It used to be one of the largest thrift stores around as well. Unfortunately the remodel appears to have reduced the size of the store significantly. It's more focused on clothing & small household items rather than large items now. It's still one of the best thrift stores around though & items seem to always be cheaper than they are marked !< /Review>< UserId.>

Excellent! I am a rather large person (6'6" and 285lbs.) and I found four 3XLT shirts! Can't ask for more than that!!! Good service and another customer and I looked for shirts for ourselves and each other. Great fun.</Text>

<Review>Good selection,  great prices but very unorganized! Cloths mixed together & looks like not by the customers either. Kids section had girls, boys & baby mixed together. Needs more than 2 cashiers when it's is as busy as it just was when I came in. I did purchase some items.< /Review><userid>106726495536093180831</userid>< GmapID>

< review>
They post hours on their website as closing at 7pm. I came to their store at 6:30pm..Employees are walking out to their cars and tell me their closed already? Why have hours of business posted if you're not going to those go by those your open. Is a reason I gave  two stars otherwise I would have gave  five stars cuz I love their store they have good deals on Friday and Saturday especially.<//review>

Wonderful place to shop for clothes, furniture, and other items when on a tight budget!

While the inside is a tad run down it's kept up pretty well and there is always a good selection of items. It also has a wheelchair accessible ramp up to the store which is great for anyone who might otherwise be unable to go there.

The items there include clothes for under $10, sometimes even new. They also have excellent furniture as well as washers and dryers which were great if on a very tight budget.  It is good to note not everything is cheaper at thrift stores as sometimes new can be the same price, however this is usually not the case.

On Thursday I believe there is 50% off of all items and I'm not sure about other days, but it tends to become very crowded during the half off day. There is a senior discount, though I can't recall what it is.

Overall it's a great place for clothes, furniture, kitchen items, and even has some great electronics if you know what your looking for.< /text>

Their price is getting too high. They DO NOT have to buy the items so their "wholesale" = FREE. Brand names should not even come into play. They are not a DISCOUNT RETAILER. They are suppose to be a CHARITY.

There is a difference. When they get into the "brand" mark-ups, they are no better than the retailers. They are WORSE because they get their merchandise FREE. A 50.00 tee shirt should NOT be seen as a 50.00 tee shirt once it hits the SA.</Review>

This place is expensive for a thrift shop, but you can get things for a reasonable price on Fridays and Saturdays when everything is 1/2 price. I get a lot of jeans and pants here for the men and boys in my family. They have nice suits, and a lot of shoes. Once they had a huge amount of donated brand new in the box little girls' shoes. I picked up a pair for $4 and they lasted quite a while. I pick up some very nice girls' dresses. It's very crowded and the lines are long and slow. It's hard to get a cart and they have so many things I can use for my family that I really need one. They have a couple dressing rooms.</Review>

<review>Jessie in furniture is a true professional and kind human, he is always so welcoming and helpful to all customers.  If it were not for this store me and my children would not have furniture, I sincerely thank God for the 50-75 percent off deals...having basic furniture and a refrigerator are blessings <3 thank you, and the staff on the registers, always kind no matter how busy they are!</review></record></dataset><record>

This place has really weird rules like you need to give them your ID to use their bathroom key and if you don't have your ID my wife had to leave her expensive sunglasses to get their dirty key to use their restroom we went there to look for uniforms for my daughter the children have to stay by their parent which is understandable but the children are not allowed to be in the kids section or the toy section for some reason they snap at people but other than that there's furniture and big items are usually On sale< /text>

EXPENSIVE!Me and my daughter. used to shop there.My daughter was going to buy a pair of shoes had no price went up to the register was told,name brand price $45 dollors.They are very rude and nasty. Really think this positive reviews are from their employees. Not even new name brand clothes I have seen tags $45>$65 dollors.and NOT on sale THAT  day.Redicules! Coffee cups a dollors Give me a break.some or most clothes stink, By the time I pay the  dry cleaners it gets expensive.The women there put the prices.. What ever they think k an item. I'd worth..A wornout, bend, scratched skillet with  no lid are very pricy.It gets rediculus..Won't shop there,
PERIOD!!only reason 1 star is so I can post.</Text>

This store may not be the prettiest but you sure can find some great deal's on used clothing here, and the 50% off everything on Friday and Saturday make shopping here that much greater. there are also allot of book's and decorative things to find at this store. If you want you're money to go along way this is the place to do it.<//Review>

I had the worst experience yesterday..I walked into the furniture area where I was greeted by a nasty manager. I asked and her name is Flora. She said that no pets allowed in the store. I kindly let her know that my dog is a service animal, and she said NO he is not. As I walk away she is talking in Spanish about me to another manager..I let her know that I speak the language as well.My Dog has saved my life in more than one occasion. This Lady FLORA really needs to learn the LAW.< /text>

< review>
This particular Salvation Army Thrift Store forgets that they are a non profit and they should be helping the local community.  This place tries to sell their items as if they were new, so that they can get as much out of the DONATED item in "Profit." Just not right.< /review>

The store website said they closed  at 7pm
however they close at 5:45pm according to the manager . At 5:30 they turned out the lights . They also don't have a posted sign with their hours on it. definitely an inconvenience.<//text>

Banana Republic Factory Outlet is awesome. They always have deals on late season and last season clothing. I spent $60 on what would have been $200 in season at a BR in the mall. Two very nice pattern shorts, 5 boxers, and a t shirt cost me $60 to look good. When I need suits I will get them at the Malibu store which carries BR's latest fashions.<//Text>

<text>They have a good selection, my biggest complaint is checking out. Never have enough check out people and it seems the manager never seems to do anything about it.

<Review>Was told that the pants were preshrunk.   After one wash, the pants were highwaters.  When tried to return, told they would return if 1/4 an inch shorter.  The store manager pinched the top and bottom to show it was less than 1/4 inch like some carnival trick.  Whem i laid the out, it wss a good imch.Honestly, it's not worth the fight.  Despite meeting their defective standard, it wasn't worth the hastle.</Review><Date>1524936946495</Date></record></dataset><record>

Haojun zhu I was at the store that exact day Mr. Haojun zhu... He did step on a pin. But he had thick sandals that never touch his skin. He made a big scene in the store demand 50%off and an apology from all the managers. They did apologize. Told him that they could not give him 50% like that and offer to make a report and have the company  send to the hospital. But he yelled and refused to work with them.</text>

I stepped on a pin in the fitting room. The manager kept insisting that they 'checked' each fitting room before letting a customer in and they were very rude. I never received an apology as they promised.<//text>

Wasn't to impressed with this car wash. There is no trash cans near the vacuums, or anywhere for that matter. The vacuums don't have any hoses. There was no curtsey bell when nearing the end of your time. The high pressure wash and brush did operate correctly though. Only took $3.00 to wash, scrub, and rinse with wax for my vw golf.< /Text>

< review>
I really don't recomend this place anymore. I used to go there to wash my car and I went there 2weeks ago and the soap part wasn't working so no soap to wash my car, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I went there this week and the foam brush didn't work, they will refund but you have to send address and all that, what a nightmare. If you like nightmares take your chances checking to see if the stations work but I wouldn't recommend it.
Thank you for reading.</review>

<Review>New and much needed addition to the community.  Friendly staff and has many options for car wash. Automated car wash is great and quick and provides machine wipe option after the wash. This place is always clean. All the equipments are working. As part of a deal they are currently giving 50% off on next car wash, which is valid for 15 days after the first wash. They also have a unlimited monthly car wash deal. You won't be disappointed 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</Review>< user>

<text>Waste of money, come here because it’s close by when I need a quick wash. Every time I come in hopes for them to fix the vacuum that never has any suction. Soap barely comes out . It did not have the last minute beep to let you know about the time. The Hose for the rinse gun , and hose for brush are always overlapping. Trash everywhere . There was a guy in the wash area spray painting his car black  with a spray can and it was flying all over cause the time there was a breeze.</text>< rate>

Rough, especially at night, homeless living behind car wash ask for money. Car wash itself was  run down and didn't have spot free rinse..had to take it to another afterwards. Not much options in the area though.<//text>

<Review>The worst place in the area...the equipment malfunction today 04/17/2019. the high pressure rinse was shooting out soap so then i tried another station same issue I had to drive my brand new vehicle with soap all over it to the next car wash off of Mountain View behind the gas station. Now I have soap spots  and wet spots  all over my new  black vehicle SMH.. do not visit the Loma Linda location PLEASE..also if you want nails or screws in your tire stay away from this place<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcab7f4a5835eb:0xd2f083eeeadf27c2</Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures><rating>1<//rating>< Name>

<response>None<//response><text>I would say this is a pretty old fashion car wash. Nonetheless it's efficient and always works. There vacuum services so you can get your car completely clean. Honestly it's one of the best self-service car washes I've been to. The only drawback is that it's a bit outdated so it looks a bit old.< /text><gmapID>0x80dcab7f4a5835eb:0xd2f083eeeadf27c2< /gmapID>< UserId.>

This is somewhat new. Never had this up before, and so far no one has enforced it. I get that there could be people waiting. However, in all the years I've gone there I've only had to wait twice and for like 5min. There is no other place with shade to dry your car to avoid sun spots. The equipment is still in consistent. Sometimes you get a good amount of soap sometimes nothing, sometimes the water sprayer is strong sometimes not. Often you have to wait about 15sec for the new option you switched to work..but you time is s th I'll ticking away. Sometimes the coin machine eats your coin. There is no one there to help.  It's cheap..and you get what you pay for.</Text>

<Text>We started with portobello fritters that comes with an outstanding aioli - so ask for extra sauce. We split everything and it was very filling. We shared the Caesar salad -excellent with amazing croutons. Then we had day- boat scallops on risotto very good. The bread is wonderful and crusty. It comes with creamy butter and salt but you can ask for olive oil that’s extraordinary. We had hot fudge sundae for dessert. Need I say more? Pure decadence!<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_id>

I arrive at this superb place from time to time because I enjoy the ambiance that is exist in this place. The crew is awfuly attentive and professional. The service is extraordinarily fast. Not to mention, the food they cook is perfect. I frequent more than once and I was always satisfied. The expense is decent. I recommend this place to to all.< /Review>

<text>I was happy to have finally tried Dave's Hot Chicken and was a good gluttonous meal before Lent. The menu was extremely limited (they also had a small collection of standard bottled beer), so unless you really loved their take on Nashville hot fried chicken, your visits may be limited. Although I enjoyed the food and felt it was reasonably priced, I would be an occasional diner at best (I needed to try the mac & cheese!) if I needed a chicken fix since they were relatively close to me. Plus, it was always a pleasure to support a mom & pop small business. I found very good value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (TOTAL paid experience was around $22.00 BEFORE any discounts and/or tip). And, they accepted my credit card of choice... AMEX! 4.0 STARS<//text>< name>

Close to lots of stuff, free parking, cute patio seating, comfy inside. The chilequilla (sp?)was soooo good. Was a bit disappointed in the cinnamon roll French toast. Looked so good but not very good. Staff was really friendly. Nice breakfast spot< /text>

<text>Excuisite menu, highly accommodating and safe place to dine during COVID.

Rivoli succeeded in resurrecting the timeless spirit of the nomadic connoisseur at a time when it was needed the most by creating the decisively smooth atmosphere, perfectly placed hospitality and seasoned staff.<//text><Rating>5<//Rating>< pictures>

<review>This has long been a favorite restaurant and my recent visit there was the best one yet! I ordered the Moroccan lamb tagine and it was just fabulous. The other people I was with also enjoyed their meals. We had a table by the window looking out on to the garden which is always a treat.

Wonderful and quaint atmosphere. A little gem where one would not expect it. Most guests appear to be locals. However, I am sure that OpenTable has filled their dining room with additional guests (just like me). Great personal service. Refreshingly not so San Franciscan. Wonderful restaurant, delicious food, and superior service. They were so accommodating to our party (which kept adding latecomers to the table) . We will definitely be back!</Review>

<Review>This is a totally biased review. I have been an avid fan of Rivoli since it opened. I have dined there countless times over the years (until I moved to Europe in 2016) and was never disappointed. It is my favorite restaurant in the world. By far. Wendy (I'm glad you're back!) is an amazing chef, consistently turning out creative dishes of the highest quality from the tiny kitchen at Rivoli. You cannot go wrong with any item on the menu, but don't forget to try their signature fried portobello mushroom appetizer (enough for two) and hot fudge sundae for dessert (you won't want to share this!). Roscoe has always prided himself in finding amazing wines from small producers and offering them at very reasonable prices. And the wait staff has always gone out of its way to make my visits the most pleasurable possible. Amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing value. Wendy, Roscoe, I really miss you guys!<//Review>< response>

We visited over the holidays. The meal was intended to be special and lived up to our expectations. We had made reservations well in advance and were shown to a table promptly upon arrival. The dining room is small and overlooks a lovely garden, which is lit at night. The food was fabulous and the wait staff was excellent. Although the prices are high, the quality more than compensates. The portions are average-to-small so nothing went to waste.< /Text>

<Name>Berny Stamp< /Name><Text>This is our go-to spot locally. It’s a small, intimate place, perfect for dates, anniversaries or any special occasion. There’s a lovely garden outside one wall of glass. It’s quiet. It’s a little dark, sometimes making it a challenge to read the menu, but that’s the ambience. The service is always excellent and the food is sublime, changing menus often to take advantage of what is fresh. Make sure to have an appetizer and dessert as these are always great. You almost always need reservations.</Text>< Resp>

Delicious food and wonderful service! Highly recommend Rivoli and ask for Henry as your server. Oysters and deviled eggs were amazing, loved the goat cheese soufflé, and the ravioli. They also have good, reasonably priced bottles of wine.< /text>

Menu changes so I don't expect my to remain there forever. Today I wanted to eat light: I had a steak tartare on a tiny toast to start with, Caesar salad, their smoked salmon appetizer dish, followed by tastes of desert ordered by my dinner companions, a sample of fudge sundae and a sample of their chocolate bread pudding with orange sauce. All absolutely delicious.<//review>

< review>
This very special little restaurant is a treasure. The site design is beautiful. The rear window shows a lush garden. The dining room is well designed taking into consideration comfort and noise management. All of this pales when compared with the food, wine and service.
The menu is small, but it covers the bases. Food is fresh and seasonal. I'm not sure my words can do justice to the food. It's magnificent. We enjoyed succulent little oysters, portobello fritters, lasagne and salmon. For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding. I would encourage people to go experience this little haven. Be prepared you pay for the quality.</review>

<review>The service was good, our food was just okay.  The portabella frittata was fried, completely hiding the subtle mushroom flavor. The Sea Bass was sold out before 7:30 so we settled on scallops which turned out to be nothing special and the corn souffle side was bland. Overall the experience left us feeling underwhelmed and overcharged.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The service here was terrific, which is really nice to have when you are out for a special occasion. Unfortunately the food did not deliver. The "saffron paella" did not seem to contain any saffron and did not much resemble paella. It did contain some lovely fresh peas. The duck dish was far too sweet and floral, so difficult to enjoy. The salad was overdressed and dull at the same time; the portabella fritters were good. The deviled eggs tasted mostly of Dijon mustard. My husband thinks they were trying to be too "experimental". That being said, if you are not too concerned with the cuisine, the place is lovely and the people who work there are wonderful. They will do their best to make sure you have a nice dining experience.<//Text>

Step out of your comfort zone you pepperoni people and try this place. Excellent pizza that doesn't skimp on the cheese or jack up the price, like so many other vegetarian pizza's do. You won't regret it. Oh, but expect lines and very limited seating. Still, it's worth it!< /review>

Best restaurant in the bay area. Consistently superb food, drinks, and desserts. They do the most amazing things with chickpeas. I often order their vegetarian dishes because they do better vegetarian than anywhere else. Worth the long drive, if you're on the other side of the bay area. And affordable -- much pricier bay area restaurants never come close to Rivoli's quality of execution.< /Text>

We had a reservation for 3 on Mother's Day and they wouldn't accept us because they said we had a reservation for 2, despite my e-mail from OpenTable confirming we had a reservation for 3. The hostess and manager exhibited poor service despite the fact that we were patient and polite. They offered us a spot at the cramped, crowded bar if we were willing to wait. This wouldn't have suited the special occasion we had planned so we had to leave and find another restaurant. Lucikly we had a great meal at Lalimes nearby.</text>

We had a poor experience with this restaurant. Maybe we are spoiled since we live in the wine country with many fabulous choices. We found the food good not great. But the portions were ridiculous. A $36 dinner was literally an appetizer size. And the service was mediocre at best. The server barely came to our table. I would not recommend this restaurant.< /text>

<review>After reading that this restaurant had somewhat slid from it's lofty height, I went somewhat expecting to be disappointed. I suggested, and my wife acquiesced to my suggestion we each order an app, entree, and dessert we had never tried before. From beginning to end the meal did not disappoint. The vegetables and protein were absolutely fresh, and seasoned delightfully. We came away with new favorites, which is one of the best results you can hope for. The price was also 20% lower than I was expecting. Will definitely go back.< /review>< rating>

< Review>
I have never had a bad meal at Rivoli.  Come to think of it, I have never had a meal that wasn't great.  The food is excellent and the dining room, though a bit small and sometimes cramped, has a wonderfully romantic feel.  One of my favorite things about Rivoli is the wine list.  Nearly every bottle is under $100 and most are under $50.  The somelier doesn't try to overwhelm you with a long wine list, but rather has chosen ~4 pages of full bottles and 1 page of half bottles that all pair wonderfully with the food.< /Review>

<time>1477862660619</time><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>My wife took me here for my birthday after painstakingly searchung for good restaurant in the Berkeley area. She had heard good reviews of this place and decided this would be suitable for our celebration. Upon first impression, I thought the place was quaint and cute and cozy. The dining area was cramped but intimate and very crowded, typical of a Saturday evening. Let me say I thought the food was delicious and the maitre 'd was very professional. I thanked my wife for taking me here on my birthday and amazingly the maitre 'd must have heard me because he treated us to a sundae with celebratory candles which I thought was a nice gesture.

However, the service was sub par. I could see the place was busy but I also saw 3 waiters serving a room of about 25-30 people. Our server kept bumping into me as he was serving the table next to us and several times I had to lean out of the way so he wouldn't hit me as he was serving, clearing, and pouring water. I didn't care for him reaching across my face to pour. We spent almost 200 dollars for the dinner and my wife ate half her meal, requesting a box to take home. They completely forgot her leftovers after she specifically asked for TWO separate boxes. This was no cheap meal and she didn't get to finish it.

I will state for the record that I value my wife's taste and was definitely exited to try a new eatery based on her opinion. We both agree that we felt the service started out well but then deteriorated into feeing like we were being neglected and forgotten. If they wanted to clear the table for waiting patrons, they should have been more attentive. They expect a high premium for there food. We deserved an equal caliber of service.

Never going back. There are better places that we intend to spend our hard earned money. The night started as a 5 star. The 2 stars is for the good food.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>Chez Panisse still stands strong as a top 10 best restaurants in California or even the US. A trip to Northern California, is never complete with-out a visit to Chez Panisse. The food, the service, the atmosphere, etc, etc. BUT....... a small blemish.... Ahh the lost art of properly crumbling a table - the sweeps left and right and then...<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x8085794af3fd1465:0xd4328f9b72334eaa<//gmapID></record>

One of the most overrated restaurants I've ever been to. Ordered a shrimp 'entree', it was more like appetizer size with 5 medium sized pieces of shrimps and a few asparagus. It tasted OK, nothing special and cost $27!! It was the first time I left a restaurant still hungry!

It had a nice and cozy atmosphere. I was the first one arrived at the restaurant and got seated near the entrance/kitchen instead of near window with nice view even though the restaurant was completely empty and there were tables available for two near the window.

On top of that, I asked the guy in suit (I think the owner) what the password was for the wi-fi which was listed in the list of available wi-fi networks on my phone he told me he didn't know the password??

Overall I don't see anything worth of it's current rating about this restaurant other than the atmosphere which comes after food quality and customer service for me. I think this is one of the restaurants that caught the 'high rating fever' and stopped caring about customers.<//text>

Happy to see a menu with almost everything vegan. The staff was really nice and helpful. Plus for clean restaurant and reasonable prices.<//review>< Pics>

Wonderful place! I have been eating here since they opened. Still fantastic service with takeout. I truly appreciate the care taken when they package their food. They always package the wet items so to prevent any car spill, soups always have the noodles packed separate from the broth to prevent soggy noodles, and fresh herbs toppings are included separate. Great owners. Highly recommend< /review>

As a vegetarian, it is so nice to go to a restaurant and know I can have everything on the menu. About 98% of the menu is vegan, anything that isn't vegan is clearly noted. Food is delicious; I wish I lived closer so I could eat here every day!</text>

Really delicious fresh vegan dishes with amazing sauces. Not a fancy place, but definitely worth returning to. I bought 5 dishes to take back home to SF after my trailrun on Mt. Diablo. I recommend eating here.< /Text>

< Review>
Veggie Today tops my list when I want my fix of meatless vegan food. The Drumsticks, Thai fried rice and Mongolian beef are my favorites as they are simply delicious! Their soup varieties are worth trying too. I have visited this place few times with my family and the food is consistently good. They also have extensive menu items. Best vegan menu in the area!</Review>

This is one of the only vegan/vegetarian restaurants in this area. It is my favorite place to eat because I know all but 2 menu items are vegan. I have taken non vegan friends and they love it. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming. Oh and it is so affordable, Such a great place to have so close to home! Two very enthusiastic vegan thumbs up!<//Text>

<text>I've actually never been here personally cus I live in Sacramento, but my friend who lives in the bay Bay area knows to bring me the "chicken" drumstick things from this place every time he goes. They're SO GOOD. OMG. Literally broke my diet just to eat a whole bucket of them. With the sauce they send with it... It's pretty much perfection.< /text><user_name>Mel Cat<//user_name>< pictures>

<Review>EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I eat meat, but if I lived in Concord,  I swear I could EASILY become a vegetarian! Extensive menu,  expertly prepared, well-seasoned dishes, FLAVORFUL sauces!!! OH SO YUMMY!!! (This is where we usually go, when I visit family in the Bay Area). Can't wait for the next time!<//Review><username>BACK ATCHA< /username><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

They've increased their prices recently but it's still a fair price place to go considering how good the food is and the portions they give. The service is great and I always love the food here. I've been coming here for at least two years and I'm never unsatisfied by service or food.< /Review>

Amazing vegan food. I recommend the beef noodle soup and drumsticks. I've never had anything like their "fish", it tastes so much like the real thing. Fast service too. My favorite vegan place in this area!</Text>

Veggie Today is new to our area, and a very welcome addition. Their menu is extensive, they are open for lunch and dinner, and they will work with you for special dietary needs. We had green beans and tofu over rice, a sesame and eggplant dish and curry vegetables over rice. All were excellent. The service was pleasant and fast. We look forward to going back here again and again to eat their healthy dishes. The restaurant is small, but pleasantly decorated. It is just two blocks from Todos Santos Plaza, west of Concord Ave. on Salvio St. There is lots of free parking around. It is about a 15 minute walk from the Concord BART Station.</Text>

<Review>Couldn't be happier to have chosen this restaurant! I am a visiting vegan from the island of Kauai where we don't have a wide variety of vegan choices. I was really looking forward to coming to California and enjoying a menu dedicated entirely to meat alternatives. Veggie Today was my first choice and they have set the bar very high for any other vegan option during my visit......although I do plan on a very thorough investigation:)< /Review>< pics>

Every time I go it's a toss up for two of my favorite dishes. Luckily they are both big enough to share. The seafood soup and the Vietnamese crepe. Any of the fried rice are also a delicious addition.< /text>

<review>I love this place because they have the best vegan options. I had the Mongolian beef one day. Last time I was there I had the scrumptious sweet and sour beef. They have many other vegan/vegetarian options too. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a healthy meat alternative.< /review>< UserId.>

<Text>Very tasty food. Veggie focused meals. I personally really love their salt & pepper tofu (unlike any other place I've tried), and their claypots.

Their lunch is also great little rice and something meals.</Text>< resp>

<text>This place is really amazing. I was with three other people and we all ordered different items to share. The food is 100% veggitaren and made to represent the real thing. The food itself is an interesting variety of different Chinese dishes and the cooks seem to care about how they prepare your food. Everything is very well priced and you get alot for your money! Three main dishes a large salad and two appetizers came up to around $54.

The building looks like a standard Chinese hole in the wall restaurant. There is a television that plays the usually sports or news. The dishes and utensils are of the same standard.

I am not a vegetarian (I eat meat about three times a week) because I haven't found something that could replace meat. Veggie Today is definitely a place to go if you are looking for a vegetarian meal that taste like the real thing!

I'd recommend the dish 5.1. I really enjoyed it and if I didn't know that it wasn't meat I wouldn't have figured it out.< /text>< user_name>

<Text>Ordered the Tofu Special for take out and...MY GOD!  SOO DELICIOUS!  Crispy tofu on a bed of sliced carrots & cucumbers with broccoli and cauliflower.  If you dont like it spicy, be sure to have them skip the sliced jalapenos.  Otherwise they're a nice kick of heat with the awesome flavor of this dish.  Was well worth the wait and they were quite busy for the lunch hour too.  Going to have to come back.< /Text><user_name>stfu_tabs Twitch (stfu_tabs - Twitch)< /user_name>< Response>

They always treat customers well and answer all questions. I like that they recommend what’s best for you and take there time with (us) the customers. The place is always set up nice and clean. The items they sell are very well worth each penny. Strongly recommend this place for anyone looking for any type of body shaper.<//text>

The service was wonderful and very fast. He really cares about the customer, not rushing the person to buy them right out the door. Also the work was done such in a professional and respectful manner. I would recommend this place, for anyone who is searching for quality not quantity of the product.< /review>

My mom goes here all the time and tells me how great Ms. Bertha's customer service is. She got a body shaper (faja) and its really working. Its helping my moms shape like a hour glass. I love her results. I just got cosmetic surgery and in a week I'm going to need my 2nd stage faja so I will be heading over to Ms. Bertha really soon. My moms waist is looking snatched !!!!!</review>

This store is very helpful. The material is very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this store if you want to get a gurdle (faja) and get shape or slim. 100/100 recommend !!! As well as very polite customer service, they want to help you as much as they can !< /text>

Loved the customer service this couple gave
Both Juan and Bertha were helpful and very informative with my post op surgical care
To what garments I should be wearing and which I should not
The garment was pricy but the customer service does not compare to any other garment shaper shops
So it was worth every penny< /Review>

I got my first faja from here almost a year ago, and it’s still in great shape! I just went back again to another one from them and I also took my sister because she loved the quality of mine. The owner and her husband are super beyond friendly they don’t make you feel uncomfortable I will definitely be going back!</review>

<Review>I am very satisfied with the service I got from Bertha and Juan. Purchasing a faja is not as easy as it seems. Bertha and Juan took the time to listen to my needs and concerns and narrowed it down to exactly what I wanted and needed. I got the perfect faja for me and have purchased two more since my first purchase back in June. I highly recommend this place!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I went a couple of weeks ago and they were very helpful, they know their products, gave me a lot of new info on the fajas I’ve been using and the lady even showed me how to put it in correctly 😄I have been doing it wrong all this time and she also suggested other varieties that save me $$, they made me feel very comfortable and the knowledge they have is impressive< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I started with the XL girdle and I liked it. I had to go back for an L. The material is good and the girdles last a long time. I 100% recommend coming here to buy from Berta and Juan. They are friendly and help with all kinds of questions you may have. Very kind 😊

Very interesting concept. Had the Beef Currywurst: it was spicy with curry/turmeric flavor mixed with sweet ketchup/BBQ sauce. Get something to drink with it cuz it is spicy (in a good way). This place should have move reviews. I found this type of food more interesting than Eggslut.

Pro tip: avoid using fingers to eat otherwise turmeric will stain you yellow</review>

Let me tell you, mouthwatering! Just finished 2 traditional brats in a bun with grilled onions. There is nothing i could possibly want different. The sausage was perfectly firm and juicy, the sweet grilled onions paired perfectly with the slight vinegary taste of the sauerkraut. And the bread! It just brings it all together. Nothing of this meal says "fast food". I honestly didn't even use the ketchup and mustard. Perfect as is. I worshipped every bite.< /Review>

Definitely a hot dog guy. But I mean it wasn't the best hot dog iv had taste wise  (see costco) but it give it more more stars cause of the various varieties that is pretty cool :)  but the hot dog isn't my favorite alone though. Gotta add some stuff to it for me< /Text>

I've been wanting to check this place out for a while, and finally got the opportunity today. Great service, great menu options, and great tasting food, but -- TINY portions at the cost. I really enjoyed the bratwurst breakfast hash, but it was so small that I was still hungry right after finishing. One would think that a bowl of meat and potatoes with egg would be pretty filling, but nah. Literally had to get more food right after eating. I don't mind paying $20 for a meal, but my hope is that it's worth it, and this left me feeling a little buyers/diners remorse. Might be a good place to go if you have a small appetite and don't mind dropping a lot of cash on a very tasty snack.< /text>

They have food that tastes great. It's full if flavor with a twist of spice. I get the currywurst bowl with sausage, potatoes, sauerkraut and a over medium egg. It looked small, but I was quite satisfied. That's saying a lot because I'm 235lbs 6'2".

I don't know their beer but would enjoy seeing what they have on tap.<//text>

<review>The cook was talking on the phone all the time, he got several orders wrong. He was handling his phone, then grabbed the bread with his hands and served it on my plate. He was constantly coughing on the food and just didn't bother to cover himself. The worst part is you're waiting for over 15 minutes for him to cook a sausage and your staring at him doing all that for all that time, oh and you pay over $15 for average tasting food.<//review>< Response>

I had never had it before, and it was great.  The skin was super crispy, and the meat was very tender and juicy.<//review>< Pictures>

Great bratwurst, fries, kraut, etc. The only disappointment for me at a currywurst place is that their curry sauce is not very good; it's overly sweet and has just a hint of curry. Not bad, but not great either. Stick to a brat in a bun with great kraut and onions, and their lovely house brown mustard< /Review>

GERMANY 🇩🇪
Eat the World LA review:
Anytime you are not in Germany, currywurst is a dish that there just is not enough around for satisfaction. Some renditions are around town but fall flat, even in good environments. Here at Grand Central Market, the environment is not terrific, but the dish is done right. Berlin Currywurst is originally from Los Angeles, but has also set up another shop in New York City. It offers a fairly compact list of options, something of a necessity for this market.
°
Dive straight in and make one with the original style bratwurst and original curry sauce, served with bread. The menu lets you dictate your sausage and your sauce, so follow your original with the käse (filled with cheese) on your second visit. Curry spice levels can be adjusted as well, and 3 out of 4 was already giving great kick.
°
Add a side of fries, knowing that one of life's simple pleasures is dipping one in both good curry sauce and mayonnaise, which is available in a squeeze bottle. Most importantly, the little stand has a beer and wine license, and a few selections of German beer. Sausage and beer is not rocket science, but it kind of is at the same time.<//review>

<Review>Let me tell you, this place inside Grand Central Market was a nice little find. Never been a fan of their neighbor EggSlut and their long lines (I'm glad they are making money, it's just not a place either personally like).  I stopped here because there wasn't a line and I love sausage in my mouth!!

I ordered a breakfast sandwich that was amazing. German sausage topped with kraut, onions, and a sunny side up egg. Sprinkled with a little curry!

I hope this place makes it, I will definitely be back.

Check out my pix, the food looks great and it tastes even better.

Until next time...<//Review>< pictures>

This place is right by Eggslut and when I was in line there I noticed the menu here. Months later I returned here to try something. I'm not sure the egg did anything for the sandwich, but the paprika sausage was certainly good. And the sauerkraut salad was great. I'm not a fan of sweet, but with the sour from the kraut the flavors were really good together.< /Text>

<text>A native Berliner reviewing a Currywurst stand in LA - and trust me, I'd love to give this little business some more credit as the idea of bringing original Berlin Currywurst to LA deserves 5 stars, let alone the use of the Berlin bear, the logo of the city.

Currywurst originated from Berlin, invented by Herta Heuwer in the late 1940's. It's basically a slightly fried pork sausage, topped with a special ketchup (the secret sauce!) and curry flavor. Sounds simple, but it's soooo good.

At the Berlin Currywurst stand in the Grand Central Market you'll get a decent tasting Currywurst either on a paper plate (original) or in a bun (American). You can add fries (original) or Sauerkraut (American).

But folks, $6 for one small Currywurst?! You gotta be kidding me. This is street food. It's like selling a taco for $5 just because it's from Mexico. Also, $4 for a super small side of Sauerkraut is nothing but ridiculous.

After paying $11 for a tiny Currywurst and a spoon of Sauerkraut my stomach felt as empty as before and I queued up at the Thai stand to get a plate of fried rice. Wow. I just paid $20 for my lunch.</text>< Pics>

Very small portions and expensive. The currywurst was nothing special and 3/4 the size of a regular hot dog. Total cost of meal was $16 and was still hungry.</Review>

< review>
Family owned. I've been going for years. One of the few spots I can go to and if I needed a favor they would trust the word of their customers. I have a issue asking for anything without paying but when I been short in the past it wasn't the end of the world like 7 11 or university liquor. They have the best alcohol deals in the area and one of the few stores in riverside that sell liquor and stay open til 2pm.<//review>

<text>Are your sick of facing the responsibilities that plague us daily? Are you exhausted by the  thought of anything based in reality? let go of your grips on existence by DROWNING yourself in overpriced alcohol and BLUR your pains away into a pit of meaningless stagnant substance abuse. Forget about working out, forget overcoming your obstacles in life, GUZZLE THE PAIN AWAY!!!!!! Suck the corporate dong of the alcohol industry and be a good consumer. That's boy, bow down and obey.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This is one of my local watering holes, and the people know and always friendly. Prices are good, and selection(especially craft beer) is exceptional. All the liquor you need, and other party favors and such.

I have know the family who owns the store for a over 3 years now, and I was a lil bummed out the last time I went there it was 7pm and I was getting paid at midnight and I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, and as I always do I offered to pay more for the pack or bottle I needed at the time Always squaring up “on time” flawless 💯 I had always come in the morning when the owner usually works and he is the one they always extended me these kind of credits, but I came by in the evening and a younger gentleman was working and said because that was up to the owner it was out of his hands. I’m not mad at him it is what it is I guess, but I guess I’m just let down that he didn’t act like it was possible. And still at midnight I was there buying my liquor, cigarettes and munchies as no where else In like a 10 mile radius was open.

This is a great store and I believe anyone looking for a good liquor store would be cool rolling thru here. Don’t let my personal experience discourage you from coming here. As many of you reading these probably don’t have the financial struggles I have sometimes, I just felt it was worth mentioning as I have always kept my word when I asked for credit.</Text>< name>

A small but friendly store. I was actually surprised at the variety of alcohol, non alcohol drinks, snacks and other assorted items they had. From what I saw it was reasonably priced for a convenience store.</Review>

<Text>not a great variety of sodas or snacks. The employees are nice but generally seem rushed to get the customers out. The store is clean but not very well organized. It is awfully cramped. I wouldn't recommend but I would definitely shop there again.

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Bought a car from this dealer about a month ago. I went in there after just receiving my SSI after surviving an aneurysm, went there with my kids and my elderly mother. The owner Ariel didn't like questions, and was rude to us. He lied about the engine being rebuilt changing his stories and the day after the warranty expired the engine light went on. We went to the ford dealer and was told that there's no way the car could've passed smog legally. There's a multitude of issues with the car now after casual driving for just over a month.

I feel I was taken advantage of and very disrespected by the owner Ariel.
I don't recommend taking a chance with this dealer.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Always checking on world motors website for good reliable vehicle’s, I have purchased about five cars from them always happy with my purchase, now let’s talk about about the repair shop very knowledgeable mechanics, plus the owner is a engineer in automotive mechanics with many years of hands on experience, besides being one of the most honest person I’ve ever dealt with , Whether you are purchasing a car from him or having one repaired. Which we all know is hard to find in that industry.All that being said good luck finding a bad review on this website, if you do see a bad review Ignore it because if you know these guys over there at World Motors you know it’s not true.</text>< pictures>

I went to get a transmission fluid change, and the guy was so honest with me about what was going on with my transmission fluid. Basically the guy made me feel comfortable about what my choices were and didn't try an burn me for money. I didn't receive service today but another day I will.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I have used this mechanic for nearly 20 years and their prices, service, and honesty can't be beat. Ariel, the owner-operator of this place, is an experienced mechanic and engineer with multiple degrees. He does great work and stands by that work after it's completed. I've also purchased multiple cars from this dealer and been exceedingly happy with their price and performance. If you're in the market for a car or just need some work done, this place can't be beat.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Rip Off Report ..... On June 2, 2012, Gary & Vanessa Fortson purchased the [2001, Saab, 9-3 SE] from World Motors Incorporated in the amount [$4,300] . When my family and I arrived at World Motors Incorporated, I Gary Fortson test drove the 2001, Saab 9-3SE. I noticed that the fuel gauge indicated empty. The owner (Ariel Verna) indicated to my family and I that he was driving the car from his home to work daily and it was a good car.

I asked Ariel Verna if there was enough gas in the car to make it to the nearest gas station and he replied “yes”. I drove the car to the nearest gas station. I gave the gas attendant $40 to fill the tank. But, to my surprise the  2001, Saab, 9-3 SE only took $10 to fill up the tank.

Despite repeated attempts to repair the car by [World Motors Inc.], Frank’s Transmission & Auto Repair and AAA Auto Repair.  The 2001 Saab 9-3SE remains defective. The 2001 Saab 9-3 SE was sold with the fuel gauge not working,  electrical problems, motor leaks and transmission leaks.

Note: I (we) would not have purchased the 2001 Saab 9-3SE if World Motors Incorporated had disclosed all of these problems to us<//Text><date>1354117222190</date><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

The mongolian is super good and they are really good with portions and serving. Just be mindful because they charge by the pound so a nice tray for two can add up a bit but it's totally worth it. Get a side of rice too as the Mongolian doesn't come with any!<//Text>< Pictures>

Wow how amazing is this place. Looking for a veggie option and pleasantly surprised. Plenty of veg options and all very fresh. Staff and service were very friendly and cheap as for 2 huge meals with rice! You gotta go as you can have some of the pre-made dishes which looked great or choose to have your own dish made. Highly recommend food and backed up with friendly service<//text>

This place serves some delicious Mongolian food. They're usually packed even during these covid days. So no more self-service, but they do accommodate for the social distancing pretty well.< /text>

It's much better than standard Chinese food in a strip mall with a clean interior and friendly staff. I always get a little Mongolian grill with a little of the Chinese food so I can experience a great variety of food.

Corona pandemic specific, the process is very easy as staff will prepare your buffet food for you. Plenty of protection guards everywhere to ensure safety along with staff correctly wearing gloves and masks (no barely just covering the mouth here!).</review>< gmapID>

Just incredible! We ordered 2 Bloody Mary kits, and 1 BBQ oyster kits. They showed up fresh, and delicious. Had a great day drinking bloody Mary's, shucking and enjoying oysters. We may make this an every other week tradition during quarantine. Support these guys if you can. Great company, and a great product!< /text>

We have been here twice and found the food pretty good both times. The variety was good and the food was fresh. We loved the Mongolian pork, spicy chicken and the coconut shrimp the most. The fried chicken drumsticks seemed dry and the meat was stretchy!I won’t recommend any deep fried meat from here!< /review>

This place is #2DIE4 !!! I was out one day in an unfamiliar part of town for me when I stumbled upon this restaurant. It's great because it is an all you can eat, I  believe, so take out is charged by the pound. Which means no restrictions or having to choose one item over another. You can have a little bit of everything! Service is warm and welcoming. And of course the flavor is DElicious!!!< /text>

Love the place but cant wait until back to normal. I want to put whatever I want in the box. The lady I don't know if she acts dumb about what I want in the box or the language barrier. But this still causes not the best customer service.<//review>

Ordered from here before with no problem, however, this time was different. I often take my food to-go. This time I found bugs in the broccoli. So unappetizing! Never coming here again.

By the pound Chinese food. They have pretty good tasting food and it's always crowded for a reason. My favorite from here is the coconut shrimp. It's self serve then they weigh it at the register. Good location on the corner of Hawthorne and Century with a nice sized parking lot.</Text>

They sell steam table Chinese food by the pound that's taste pretty decent. I liked the shrimp with mayo (no walnuts). I think the price was $4.10 per pound as of December 2019.</review>

<Date>1558884085938< /Date><Rate>2<//Rate><review>I traveled all over Southeast Asia and I know Chinese food quite well.  This restaurant is a solid 2 star and nothing more in my opinion.  Average value with bland taste.  Nothing in this place stands out.  It's just an average place with average taste for people who don't know the taste of good Chinese food.  Not the cleanest either, but at least I didn't see any roaches. Once you add the rice, the price goes up. Mongolian was descent, but lacked flavor.  Next time, I'll find somewhere else with better taste.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

In other words get as much as you want and pay per pound. Is really cheap for the food and worth it.< /review>< Rate>

They charge you by the pound for Chinese food. (3.80) By the pound!!!  I eat very small and I spend $3.60 for less that a pound of selected food. And since is a busy place food is being cook fresh, to refill the empty containers of the station. They also have Mongolian grill at the same place.<//Review>

<Review>This place has a variety of asian cuisine and charges by the pound. It's like a buffet style set-up and you can choose the items you want from beef and broccoli to coconut shrimp. The also prepare Mongolian style food and variety of drinks with or without bobba. The staff does a great job at providing fresh trays of food when running low.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

You have 2 style options, either Chinese Fast Food style or Mongolian Style. The difference between other Chinese fast food restaurants is that here you serve yourself as much or as little as you want and mix as many options as you want. The cost is based on weight so prices may very.</text>

This place sells the Chinese food by the pound so you can get a little of everything and also has a side Mongolian BBQ fire pit right in the establishment. How do they do it? Go and see. They do it with a stick and a little water and then that she sizzles and then it's like wow here's my meal.<//Text>

<text>Great Chinese/Mongolian in Inglewood. You can pick between the premade Chinese food buffet island in the middle; or the fresh meat and veggies on the side which they cook right in front of you. They charge by the pound, so you can get as little or as much as you want.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Don’t trust them with your credit cards or any kind of card you pay with. Cash only! Since paying twice with them, I have had to replace my card those two times.

Keep in mind, I used both cards with different numbers to pay here. Furthermore, what’s very unusual was that I was getting charged refunds from other establishments I’ve never been to; refunds with the exact amounts I paid  Mongolian bbq. For example, I paid $13.11 and then all of sudden I was getting charges for $13.11 and immediately refunded $13.11 from other restaurants. Maybe the owners are trying to see if my card works ?

Now im not pointing fingers at New China, but I want the reader to make their own conclusion. Whether your cards should be used here ? I’ll let you decided on that. Also, their food is very delicious, but from now on I will only pay them cash.</Text>

Mongolian food is bomb!. Chinese food is also very good. This is a must if ur craving Aidan food.
Only bad thing is it's always packed. And resgister ladies can be rude at times.<//review>

From self serve to selecting what i want on my plate, all is done with such ease. This is weigh and pay. Dont be surprised if you go bonkers on all that greatness. So dont have to be picky because all your favorite Asian togo items are available and fresh. And the guys at the wok are awesome and nice. Never feel shy to ask for anything. Restrooms spotless and beverages in stock. Soda to boba nice.</Review>

<review>This is my go to place for Chinease food. It is a buffet style place where you serve yourself. You pay by the wheight of your box. Honestly, the food is good and has better quality food than most other chinease food joints. The customer service here is nice. Only concern is that during peak hours there is little seating. Overall, great food and service.<//review>< Date>

<time>1549735209263< /time><Review>My favorite Chinese buffet in the entire LAX area. I could choose anywhere in LA to stay as I travel for work, but I choose Inglewood anywhere near the new Rams stadium they're building because it's right next to LAX so I can get to the airport in a few minutes and the traffic is way better to access the different interstates and highways. Not to mention the city seems to be nicer than the descriptions I've heard years ago since I'm from Georgia.
The Chinese restaurant is within walking distance from my hotel and they charge by the pound so I can determine how little a quantity I want instead of having to choose an item based off of it's set price. This place  has a mix between Chinese, Korean and Mongolian style dishes. My favorite choices there are the pork galbi (Korean style short ribs), the peppered chicken and the coconut shrimp is to die for! The best coconut shrimp  I ever had in my life. They have lomain, fried rice and also give the choice of regular white rice! Yeeeeeessss! I'm half Korean and white rice is what I crave when I have a choice. You can also stand in line and get the traditional Mongolian style food cooked in front of you as well. I think the price is between $3 or $4 per pound. I got 3 to go boxes for $17 last time I went which was less than $6 per person. I haven't been eating Chinese much these days until I came across this place now I eat it as regular as I do all the other restaurants and comes out to be cheaper than McDonald's or burger king</Review>< user_id>

Great place for by the pound Chinese food and Mongolian BBQ. Spicey Chicken, Honey Shrimp, and the chicken and mushroom dishes are the best!!<//text>

(Translated by Google) The food is very good and rich ... the bad thing is the cashiers who ask them for something and they don't want to give it to you

(Translated by Google) What I love most is that you can also take what you are going to eat raw and the boys already cook it very rich.

(Original)
Lo que mas me encanta es que también puedes tomar lo que vas a comer crudo y ya los muchachos te lo cocinan muy rico.😋😋😋😋.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Absolutely try. Best go 2x. The first time I tried the large selection of already finished food and in the evening the Mongolian grill. Here you pay for weight and price performance is right.

(Original)
Unbedingt probieren. Am besten 2x hingehen. Beim ersten Mal habe ich die grosse Auswahl an schon fertigen Essen probiert und am Abend den Mongolen Grill. Hier bezahlt man nach Gewicht und Preis Leistung stimmt.<//review>
