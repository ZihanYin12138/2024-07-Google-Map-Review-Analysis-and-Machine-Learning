What a find! Amazing FRESH food- no microwave or reheated items! Everything in house.  Fabulous family run establishment with friendly service and personal attention. The food matches the service- every trip has been delightful. Hot tip- the grass fed burgers are superb!!</Review>

My first time here on Sunday, I ordered a Bbq pork burger and garlic fries. I love their grass- fed burger options. The fries were delicious and the bbq pork was amazing. The owner was friendly, great customer service. I definitely recommend this restaurant 🍟< /Text>

Glad I did. The burger was delicious and the tater tots were incredibly crispy and tasty. It's definitely on my list of pre-movie eateries now that things are opening back up.</review>< pictures>

It's a good idea, clever name, fun location for us clmt'rs, and friendly people.  Good times can be had!!

I think, and don't know for sure 💯, that all the food here is frozen, thawed, and then heated up.  Seems to taste that way...  Even the grass? fed? burgers?  I guess that's ok?

Anyway - hope this place gets better over time!<//Text>

My husband and I have tried all the top rated burgers in San Diego and this one by far is one of our favorites! Great menu options, delicious and fresh taste, with wonderful service. BNC sauce is great to dip in their crispy seasoned fries! Can’t wait to keep coming back and try everything on the menu.< /Text>

I had a chance to eat here 3-4 times and I like the burgers that I ordered and it's good enough portions to satisfy my ferocious appetite. I like the fries, but I love the tater tots. I only know one other place that has them as sides.

Update: Wow a celebrity mom was spotted eating here at The Butcher N Cheese, none other than M J Shannon from Kim Kardashian show. This is amazing. Is this the next low key celebrity hangout spot or what.</Review>

<Text>Great burgers and fries. Ordered the swiss chalet burger with beef patty, it was delicious, loved the sesame seed bun. Also had the French fries which were great. Only downside was very busy so not alot of available seating and if you get a table you have waiting dinners looking over you as you eat. Staff were friendly and fast service.<//Text>< time>

<user>112124485229687982755</user><Review>Excellent service. Wonderfully seasoned fries and onion rings probably the best I've had in a while. While I didn't have the burgers they looked amazing and there were good comments made regarding them. The wings however were of poor quality and were extremely fatty (breading, a thick layer of fat and grease and then some edible meat on the inside) which made me a bit queasy I couldn't enjoy the sauce on the wing because I was trying to dodge the fat. If you go I suggest the more traditional route of burgers and chicken sandwiches. You won't be disappointed.< /Review>< Rate>

<Text>New place and very good. the food is a little inconsistent but overall pretty good. I had a hot dog with a fried egg on it. Might sound a little strange but it was delicious. They had to redo the fish-and-chip because the fish was a little overcooked.you can tell alot of loved one into creating this business. All new furniture. Immaculate kitchen.

Have had my eyes on this place for some time! Was pretty excited to see they had finally opened. First impression was the decor was pretty nice, the wall artwork definitely catches the eye. The menu is pretty expansive, even offering chicken wings (which weren't half bad.) I went with the "Good Ol Burger", which was pretty tasty. The beef is certainly of good quality, and the toasted brioche bun had the right amount of bite to it. The french fries left something to be desired, and the portion could have been larger, but they were hot and fresh with the right amount of salt so no real complaints there. Cost is a little high for the area, but for the quality of ingredients is more than acceptable. I will definitely be returning in the future.
PROS: Good quality for the price, food is fresh and tasty, diverse offerings without feeling hipster
CONS: Could have been more generous with the fries, for a place with "cheese" in the name the cheese plate offerings weren't much
OVERALL: I would definitely recommend this place. Nice to have a proper burger joint in Clairemont.<//text>

The bison burger and lamb burger were delicious!  Our bison came out well done when we asked for medium rare. The patties were small for the price but overall the experience was great!  Super busy on a Friday night and Dinos next door had a cover band outside for entertainment!< /Text>

After watching a movie, we decided to go try out this restaurant and the food was delicious.  I ordered a patty melt and it was yummy. The service was great and the owner is very nice and friendly . I recommend this restaurant for sure👍💕</review>

<review>Burger not cooked as ordered, not once but twice.
Owner threatened to refuse service after I raised my voice to be heard over a large party of screaming and unruly children whose parents where more interested in becoming over served with beer.
Had two previous positive experiences but tonight I cannot give more than 1 star despite not having been charged for two extremely overcooked burgers.
Due to the unprofessional threat of owner which was entirely uncalled for and unjustified, I say caveat emptor or buyer beware.<//review>< pics>

I had a crispy, delicious Patty Melt and my wife had the Better Burger, which more places are offering today. Here, the Burger was properly dressed, was on a brioche bun and was delicious. The location is convenient, plenty of parking, and right by the  Clairemont movies so great for a meal before or after a film, or whatever.<//review>

Very pleased with the new burger joint.  The 'good ol burger' was spot on.  My wife tried burger of month, rhine.... something, had beer cheese on it, was good as well. Fries were very good.   Definitely will go again.</text>

I wouldn't go back. Crab cake sandwich was overfried (batter was borderline burned and hard), not sure what the crab mixture inside was made of. Did it contain any crab?  Couldn't tell. The bread wasn't well toasted.  There was far too much gloppy sauce slopped over the fish. The French fries were very good. But the iced tea was tasteless. My husband's fish and chips also overfried and tasteless.  The condiment bottles on the table hadn't been wiped off (e.g., grimy fingerprints and mustard stained), which always puts me off (and concerns me). So, in short, for $40 for lunch for two with no alcohol or dessert, I expect far better. The menu choices sound very interesting but what I ordered wasn't well prepared.<//text>

So I went there the other day not knowing if they could fix my phone because I assumed they only fixed laptops, so I went in and said can you guys fix my phone and they were so chill about it, they were like yeah and I left like a small fee only as proof of my deposit and received my quote and I'm like that was easy  after like 3 days they were like Your phones good and when I got picked up my phone , the cracks were gone and they also got my phone to work for me since it would not connect to any WiFi and they did that for me free of charge. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone having tech problems  👍I can't thank this place enough for fixing my phone<//Review>

Took in an iPhone 7 to get a battery replaced . Went to 66 battery health in less than a month . Not going to blame it on them maybe it was my phone but I never had it that low before with my old iPhone battery which was a 76 when I took it in to get exchanged .
Definitely suspect though .<//Text>

I needed my Dell battery replaced and they took care of me while I waited. I found this shop from a Google search as I was desperate for the help. I had ordered the new battery from Dell and I paid Dell for in home service when I purchased the laptop. But Covid changed everything so I had to find outside help...these guys are great I would go back.<//text>

This Review has been Edited to reflect the business and Idotechs great customer service

(Before) I got a screen replacement for my iphone 8 Plus, I paid 80$ and was assured that it would be a great quality however, they blatantly lied. My phone fell about 2 feet off my bed with a case AND a screen protector on and the screen cracked. A noticeable crack straight across the top and two straight down. Want to know how I can tell how cheap this is? My screen protector is completely fine with no cracks! How did the phone break and not the screen protector?! This is one of the cheapest screens they could probably get and straight up lied to me. My phone lasted a week and half with this screen, I will demand a refund once they open.

EDIT: Current Review
After writing this review and calling them they responded immediately and asked me to go to their shop to see what they can do for me. I went in a month after because I am still unable to drive and live a bit far from this place so I am very thankful that they even considered replacing the screen again. Although they did not do it for free they offered me a 50% discount so I payed 40$ to have the screen replaced again. These guys have great customer service and I appreciate them for offering anything whereas other places would probably not do anything. Although I am still unsure of the quality of the screen the phone looks and feels like new I just hope it doesn’t break again so easily or soon.I also want to say thanks and ultimately recommend this place to anyone looking to fix their electronics.

Dltr; Great customer service, screen looks nice, Responsive, good people< /review>

They are quick to reply to messages, I took my iPhone to get the battery replaced. They were less expensive than other places I had looked at. Had my phone ready when they said they would, and they are very polite.</review>

Brought in my PS4. They're very professional, and courteous. It took a while to get the part that was needed to fix the PS4. Which was the only inconvenience, once fixed I picked up my PS4 and it wasn't working still. Took it back the same day and they took it apart immediately to fix the problem. It was fixed right away. Nonetheless they did a great job. My system is running perfect, and with the price I really can't say anything bad about this place. Customer service was excellent. Professional, courteous, and they delivered. Definitely will be coming back to future tech problems.< /review>

I highly recommend this place.  I have an old desktop HP PAVILLION along with a HP monitor.  The monitor was not powering on.  I called Idotec on a Sunday and they happen to be open.  Spoke to Michael and took my PC and monitor right in.  He knew right away that the problem was the monitor and it was no longer repairable.  Upon reviewing the computer he noticed that my software was very outdated and that it had a virus.  He cleaned out my computer, upgraded it and sold me a used monitor.  By the next day it was ready and all done at a very reasonable price.  Michael even helped me take my PC to my car in the pouring rain!  So happy with the whole experience.  Thanks Michael.<//review>

<Time>1627780016496< /Time><Review>This restaurant is set up for faster service. So the interaction with the staff is at minimum, similar to a fast food restaurant. Another downside to this setup is that customers are not waited on after the food is delivered. After one placed the order with the host, one is given a number. One is free then to choose any available table.

The atmosphere here is better, in my opinion than the one at the older location. The outdoor seating is nice.

While I think the phở at this location tastes the same as the one at the original restaurant, my spouse believes the meat here looses its texture because it’s overcooked. All the different styles of phở come in only one size bowl: enormous. The broth is savory, the noodle on point. The condiments let one customize one’s bowl of phở: the herbs are fresh, the pickled onion offers an added dimension of taste.

I will suggest a return to this restaurant when we are in this neighborhood.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Got the spring rolls, beef pho and passion fruit drink. Absolutely fantastic and worth the wait. One pho bowl can easily feed over two
people, and prices are very reasonable.< /review>

After we ordered we came to the table and waited for our food. It came out pretty quickly. Everything tasted delicious. Would definitely come back to this location instead of the other one.< /Review>< pictures>

Voted best in OC and I can taste why. This is the second location located adjacent to Rodeo 39 right outside the big door way.

You order and pay at the door then seat yourself (at least we did because we sat outside, maybe they seat you if you sit indoor).

Everything on the menu is $10. Super cheap and authentic quality. Usually oxtail would be extra but all 16 items is $10 each. You get a choice of large or small noodles. Go with the small, it’s less starchy and filling.

A plate of veggie herbs came out, plate bean sprouts and extra onions. Along with sriracha and hoisin each in a two ounce cup.

The pho is served in a metal bowl. I took a sip of the broth and at first, it was salty but that’s before I mixed it or added limes. After I did, the bone broth was flavorful. Everything came together.

Most importantly is MSG, we are very sensitive and stop eating at places that uses MSG. We didn’t taste any here or it’s very light which is a plus.< /Text>

Visited PhoHolic twice to confirm table service. On the second and final visit on 8/18/2021, it is clear that customer service falls below expectations. If you want your drinks to be served five minutes before end of meal, then come here. During serving the basils plate, if you would like to ask for chili oil right before the staff member simply turns walks away while you are still trying to communicate then come to this place. Select what you would like to have, pay prior to seating at the door. Then all the disconnects happen between that point and when you get what is served. Their systematic flow design is a failure. Food taste can satisfy but not the best. So two stars for this broken serving style and terrible customer service.< /Text>

Reasonably priced and very good tasting soup. Restaurant is clean unlike the original Phoholic location. One complain I have is the tendon is slightly too tough. If they cook the tendon another 30 minutes it would be perfect.<//Review>

Quality of pho changed sometimes. But it's good overall. Depend what time you get in during the day of the week, it's super good. There's a lot of complaints about servers, but as I see with my eyes, there's a very nice lady who serve us in a very professional way, her name's Phuong. She's very helpful and nice to every customer. Keep going lady! Everywhere was competition in the job.</Review>

Nice, clean place for delicious Pho.
Fresh veggies is what stands out from other restaurants.
The service is fast, standard/basic friendliness.< /Text>

<Date>1615690294243</Date><Rating>2<//Rating><Review>Food here is pretty good with big serving. However, service is terrible, but it was expected from other reviews on Yelp.

Reason for 2 stars:
1. Wait staff speaks minimal English
2. Waiters not responsive to requests (Asked for water 4 times, never got it. Also, the waitress that we asked water from passed by us multiple times.)
3. Had to remind for order for drinks they forgot

I should never have given tips when I ordered. (Tips are only 0%, 15%, 25%)<//Review>< Pics>

Ordered take out, only to find out all the veggies and fixings were missing when I got home. They are all important parts of pho, can't really enjoy pho without them.  Check your order before leaving the restaurant people.<//Text>

<Review>Hnay đi ăn phở này trước khi ra sân bay, mình cảm thấy thất vọng về dịch vụ và phở ở đây. Mình order 2 tô phở tái nạm bò viên, đợi 20 phút mỏi mòn. Tí họ mang ra 2 tô đặc biệt, thì nhận ra là giao phở nhầm bàn bên cạnh, và 2 khách kế bên dc ăn trước 10 phút nhưng là tô phở của mình . Nhân viên éo xin lỗi một lời, lẳng lặng bưng vào đợi 5p để làm 2 tô khác. Tới đây là bực muốn đứng lên về lắm rồi. Sau khi ăn xong, 2 ng khách kia ra phàn nàn là họ order đặc biệt nhưng lại ăn tô bình thường. Nếu là ở nhà hàng Mỹ, chắc chắn bạn sẽ nhận discount hoặc refund từ waiters Ngay lập tức, ko để bạn phải nói nhiều và mất vui. Nói túm lại, phở đây ko bằng phở 79 nhé. Và mình ko bao giờ quay lại vì dịch vụ quá kém cỏi. Mất mặt với ông chồng vì ăn tô phở nhớ đời. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Best local spot for meat. Ranchera, cecina, smoked pork chops, pork ribs, beef ribs they got it! Weekends you can pick up grilled chicken and ribs being smoked outside. Love this place, been a customer here for over 15 years. Highly recommend. Also if you like spicy guacamole, they got it!< /Text>

<text>Carries all kinds of meats, produce, and other daily essentials.

Staff is friendly and helpful.

They make delicious roasted chicken and ribs outside in the parking 🅿 lot, smells really good when you pass by.

I gave it a 3 Star 🌟 though because it's name does not really stand for what a real Mexican Chapala market would carry.

Lack of Mexican products and beers. Their sweet bread can go hard after sitting in the bread box.

Employees are not to be blamed, it's management.

It's very clean though.</text>< pics>

The meats they have taste very fresh and the chicharron they have is to DIE FOR! They have a decent produce selection, very good priced Milk and eggs and the guacamole they make packs a huge kick! (Me being Mexican, I absolutely approve) Very nice people too, always friendly<//review>< Pics>

Carniceria Chaparral is convenient and has exceptional service. It is one of the best butcher shops in California. Their price points are extremely competitive and the value is amazing giving how expensive food is today.
I highly recommend them.< /Text>

Grill chicken is way too expensive, not very tasty, the lady in the cashing section is not very nice, not the best service,  if there was a 0 stars or negative stars I would give a negative 3 stars.< /Review>

If you are poor this is the best place to shop. Everything is so inexpensive so it is perfect for my family. It is a little small and needs a little cleaning but I still trust it.<//Review>

Their pizzas are REALLY good. This is my go to when it comes to pizzas. When I order in person everyone is nice and I get my order pretty fast considering it has to go through the oven. My only issue is when I order through UberEats, for some reason they haven't gotten that right. MULTIPLE times I've gotten part of my order wrong, sometimes after I place an order through the app I will call the store to double check that my order is going to be right. It never is. Sometimes I'll even purchase something extra and ask for it to be replaced for the item I really want, and I'm paying A LOT of money, and they ignore it. It has gotten to the point where if I'm hungry and crave pizza, I just think of the unnecessary hassle they make me go through and I don't want pizza anymore.< /text>

<text>The pizza it's super good and also the waiting time it's not bad. But on Saturday I order over the phone a large pizza half pepperoni and half Hawaiian they gave me the total of $10.75 and when I pick it up they charged me a little over $13 I didn't ask because that's about what I have paid in other places. The thing that the pizza was for a little party for my daughter and when I open the box was only Hawaiian🤦🤦🤦 I called the store and they told me that I should of go and returned and I told her "I just told you it was for a party and I was already home" and all what she told me was well sorry next time bring it back and I was no next time I will check my order because I'm not going to trust that you giving me what I order😒😒😒😒<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c93ea5598975:0x640b451bd8794572</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The food is good. The employees that I have encountered do not appear to be educated in customer service. It appears as if they do not want to be there working.  The Tumby's on Figueroa and Manchester or the one on Western between Manchester and Florence display way more customer service and are way more inviting.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2c93ea5598975:0x640b451bd8794572< /gmap_id></record>

<text>Place made me got get money from ATM because a "policy" if you don't carry an ID you can't use a debit card??? Come on the bank doesn't even ask for my ID. The pizza was made with low quality ingredients because it gave bad stomach habits to both me and my buddy. Really bad service to be honest.</text><userid>112170520851705378505< /userid></record>

<Review>This was without a doubt among the less appetising pizza we have had. When we first got it home we tasted it and thought it was not the greatest pizza we had had but it was ok. That opinion changed very quickly. Each bite we took was even more tasteless. To give you an idea, my 14 year old son who can easily plow through half a large pizza in one sitting, had two slices and wouldn't have any more. Their chicken wings were equally tasteless. Not going there again if they close every pizza joint in the city. If I could give it zero stars I would.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Perlman Clinic in Scripps Zymed location. One of the fastest, nicest, and most amazing urgent care experiences I have ever had. Came in because my little one had a toe injury, and the doctor was SO nice, she checked him out and was even able to refer us to a specialist that she recommended in the same building.< /Review>< user_name>

I highly recommend Dr. Nick Canelo at Perlman Clinic in La Jolla. He is extremely knowledgeable and caring. I appreciate his willingness to combine minimal medication as well as lifestyle changes to address my high blood pressure. His suggestions have worked well and created such an improvement in my overall quality of life. He actually listens to his patients and combines professionalism with comprehensive communication. I cannot recommend Cora more highly. She is patient and caring and an asset to the clinic. Highly recommend Perlman La Jolla for health and well being.< /review>

This clinic is spacious, super clean and the lobby is comfortable and nicely decorated. I was an urgent care walk-in patient and the ladies at the front desk were very sweet to me and helped to get me checked in right away.

100% of the time I get the best care. Stephen is fantastic &Dr. Perlman really cares about her patients. I love the staff and feel like all of my concerns are addressed when I come in. I don't have long wait times, my calls are always returned quickly and they treat my family like we are their family. You can't go wrong with the Perlman Clinic Team.<//Text>

Spot on service on short notice. I had an acute situation and the team, including Dr. Perlman and Angelique PA, were completely accurate with the diagnosis, compassionate, and calming. I live out of town and was visiting but I intend to make this my "medical home" since I am in the San Diego area frequently for business.THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart.<//Text>

<Text>My experience withPerlman  clinic on Ivanhoe on November 12 was Very  satisfying and comforting. The staff were all lovely.
Dr Macy is  warm-and patient and so intelligent. She set me up on a schedule to help with my pain medicine after a knee replacement surgery.
She Spent a great of time talking with  me in the office and then a long time  on the phone, teaching me what pills to take at what time. Shd left me  with  a great deal of confidence
And she  will help me wean off the medicine
I cannot write enough good things about her,

As usual, my appointment with Dr Canelo on 11/14/19 was very positive. I am extremely pleased and comfortable with him as my P.D.  He is and has always been interested in my health issues and works to improve my overall well-being.  Thanks<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Dr. Canelo is one of the best doctors I’ve ever worked with.

I’ve seen quite a few different doctors over the years, and it is uncommon to find one that truly listens to you, does not make you feel rushed, and works with you to find the best resolutions to health issues.

Dealing with health concerns can be challenging and require someone with compassion, persistence, and understanding to help the patient feel as comfortable as possible, especially when dealing with unfamiliar and often stress inducing potential diagnoses. Dr. Canelo encompasses all of these qualities in addition to a wide range of knowledge and a thoughtful, strategic approach.

I would gladly recommend Dr. Canelo to anyone in my family or my closest friends.< /review>< Resp>

Office is organized, clean, simple, and uses some new tech I've never seen in a doctors office.

Dr. Canelo spoked with me for an hour, which is the longest a doctor has ever done that. Mad respect for this man!< /text>< pics>

I am very happy that Perlman Clinic opened a downtown La Jolla location. I work in La Jolla three days during the week so it is much more convenient for me to go to their new location than to have to drive up the road and get stuck in traffic. Perlman Clinic definitely has the best doctors in San Diego and they have always been amazing during even the most minor visits.< /Text>

Kelly Snowden PA-C is a superb healthcare professional. I had recently moved to the area and needed someone I could trust for help and guidance. Over several mo dealt with issues ranging from simple to complicated.  Kelly Snowden always provided comprehensive, caring and effective health care services, guidance and quality referrals when needed. I could not recommend her or the entire team more highly.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< username>

I was so glad I went to the Perlman Clinic in downtown La Jolla, even though it was not close enough to where I lived.  I have seen twice by Dr. Jenny Fleming and I was really impressed by her excellent patient treatment service.  She was such a caring, concerned, focus and attentive  to my needs and health questions.  I would definitely come back for all my future appointments.<//text>

Unfortunately, I wasn't accurately diagnosed yesterday. I learned after visiting another doctor today that I have shingles in my eye.  Having an accurate diagnosis is vital because of possible eye damage. I'm sad so say that I received inadequate treatment. Sad, because the very young staff was charming.</review>

Finally found my beach! Truly lovely. Right size, perfect quality and choice of stores.

There are also other interesting areas/smaller beaches and cliffs to explore. Breathtaking views!<//review>

We love this beach. Even if it's overcast and cloudy during the drive to this beach, odds are it will be sunny in this cove. This last visit we saw sea anemones in the beach waiting for high tide. It's an awesome opportunity to teach your kids about nature and respecting the living beings all around them. Been going here for the past 12 years. Never miss it when we are in town!!<//text>

Avila is much more quiet than most beach towns, but its also undergoing more renovation than its surrounding counterparts. A great place for people to escape to with an excellent blend of commercialized shops and restaurants and the locally owned stores.< /Text>

<text>Avila beach is a gem. It has swings, a life gaurd, great waves to body board on, local shops, bathrooms and several other great amenities. But most of all it has a nice strip of beach that has a good vibe all the time. It's not too boisterous and it's a great place for all ages.< /text></record>

The best beach on the Central Coast. It is almost always the most sunny, warm, beautiful beach. It is South - facing so it tends to be beautiful weather. The tides make it fun with Tide Pools, and a</text>

This place is super clean and professional. It's also very friendly and welcoming. The artists are fantastic. I personally come for Mat Hurtado he is fantastic. Be warned...they are on the pricey side of things but to me they are worth it.</Text>

Umbrella Face (Mike) is a super cool dude and does clean work and specializes in neo traditional. the shop inside is really cool. its like an old Victorian building full of art. pretty pricey but hey its Nico's shop after all. only reason why i docked a star is because they had a guy walk in (they have a sign inside saying they do walk ins) and asked for some script. they (Not mike, not gonna say names) gave him some crazy high price quote and joked when he left saying he'll probably get it for 60 bucks somewhere else. idk maybe he thought it wasn't worth his time< /Text>

I'm working with Mat and he is fixing a HUGE mess another "artist" in Fullerton did. I am very happy with it and I would 100% recommend him.
Also THEY DO NOT DO PIERCINGS SO STOP CALLING FOR THAT.< /review>

<Review>This is one of the best tattoo shops in the country if not the world. You probably want an appointment with an artist before you get there. It's best to contact them via email first so you're not disappointed when you arrive and they are busy working on people who have been waiting months to get in to sit for work. It is well worth the wait for top quality work.</Review>< username>

These guys are a joke. First, when I went in there was no one there in the middle of the day. I literally had to walk arou d the building to do d someone. Secondly, they dude was way to arrogant when I was just inquiring about prices. Third, speaking of prices this place is charging Hearts of Hunnigton prices, with no where near the quality of of Hog. If I could afford to pay that kind of money do you think I would go to some run down place with no name tattoo artists? No I would just go to the best.< /Review>

Good food and service.  Steaks are ranch style, not aged.  So know this going in.

Edit: they are aged 14 days thank you for clarifying.  When i said not aged i meant in the sense of other steak houses that marbelize and dry age their beef 30+ days< /Review>
<resp>{'time': 1623274204736, 'text': 'Hi Andrew! Thank you for the review and visit! Cattlemens serves all-natural beed from Harris Ranch. We age it on premises for a minimum of 14 days, but really until it is aged just right. We hope to see you in again soon!'}< /resp><pics>None</pics>< GmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Me and my wife had an amazing dining experience here tonight. From the kitchen staff preparation to the waitresses amazing hospitality and very on top of every need we had. They took amazing care of us! It was our first time eating here, we are from out of town and saw it coming through and stopped with no intentions on how amazing this place would be. We will DEFINITELY be back, I recommend this to anyone for a date night, special occasion or just a casual stop in. The dress code is casual. The atmosphere is very laid back, and satisfaction is their top priority. Just a sample of the first part of our meal, it was amazing!<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZSxkXFiknV7dlkA1ZbGoemXj3bcDQ2_drcu-Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>The baked potato was great, the salad was good but no tomatoes, and my prime rib was too rare. I should have sent it back. Med rare to me should be a little solid. This was very very pink and soft, raw soft. Service by Tati was very good.</Review><time>1623561490077</time><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

Well. The food was great and cleaniness was top notch. But the service was not on point. Missing drinks and food was wrong. Had to reorder the right food to take home. Other than that everything else was good.< /text>

<review>Great meal and drinks. Didn't even get a picture as was too busy devouring to remember to review. Would say comparable to Cool Hand Luke's more than a Fleming's or Ruth's Chris for atmosphere. Meat quality and taste seemed to run with the best of them. Would definitely be a spot to return to, even if it is a 50 minute drive from my house.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

Love cattlemens but they disappointed today. I placed my order well in advanced they told me it would be ready at 7:30, they call me at 7:30 saying that they don't have 2 options of my order. I am outside walking to pick up my order. Not only did they waste my time but my fuel I don't live close.< /Text>

<text>Well, what can I say. We were greeted by the entryway and were advised that there was a 30 minute wait, and that we had to wait outside until we got a text. We went inside to get something to drink and noticed lots of tables available in the bar.Hmmm. Yet we were told  we couldn't have a drink in the bar. Anyways,  we were asked by the front desk if we were waiting and they proceeded to seat us immediately.  Our waiter Stefan was most courteous and took our drink requests.  We got our drinks and ordered some tumbleweeds for the appetizers,  these are the best onion ring extraordinaire.  We ordered Dakota Chicken with bacon, mushrooms,  and a honey mustard sauce. My sister had the New York steak, which came out perfectly cooked. I ordered the Salmon, blackened with baked potatoes all around. Your bread is the best...with the soft dough in the center, and so hearty crust. Tastes so good with lots of good butter. What makes this even better than most other places is that the butter comes soft, ready to smooth on the bread....not tearing up the bread. We enjoyed our meals as always, and left a hearty tip for our waiter. He really enjoys his job, which goes a long way during these times. We try to stop at Cattleman's whenever we come across one in our travels. Thanks again Amigos, for making our visit pleasant and very enjoyable, Robert, Jennie, and Mary from Kingsburg.😎😎😎<//text><Response>None</Response>< time>

The dinner was so good.  We had not gone out to dinner for a very long time.  The pandemic kept us from going anywhere.  The atmosphere was great,  the servers or so polite made you feel like home.  I had a lobster dinner and it was perfect.  The steak and shrimp was also good, we had not had that great tastes in a long time.  If you’re looking for a great dinner great meals go to Cattlemans, in Selma.</review>

Need to call ahead for reservations due to pandemic rules. Had a steak, very good. Meal comes with salad, beans and a side. All was delicious. We didn't get reservations so our wait time was over 45 min. Other then the wait time service was great.</review>

< review>
The soup and beans were cold. The beans also came in a small soup cup for our entire table of 5 to share. I ordered a fillet and came overcooked and was offered a new one. The second steak I was brought was cooked perfect but was not a fillet, but a NY strip steak. At that point the rest of my table was done with their entree so I stuck with it. The apple pie dough was also raw in the middle the 1st go around. The appetizers were good at least but that was about it.</review>

<text>It's very unfortunate that Cattleman's has moved their business outside. I ordered a full lobster dinner, by the time I got done taking the shells off and checking them for any random shells they were luke warm. By the time I was about to finish my first tail the meat and butter were cold. My daughter ordered a sirloin steak medium well. It was still bleeding and a cool center to touch. She showed our waiter and he was kind enough to order her another one at no cost to us. When the new steak arrived at our table, it was worse then the first one and she requested the second steak to be well done. Overall the company was great and our waiter was very helpful. But we won't be back until they are able to open the restaurant and we can eat inside.< /text>< gmapID>

Food wasn't as good as I heard it was, super disappointed, server kept disappearing, 3 other servers were more attentive to us then are own server. I ordered the prime rib sandwich it was all fat. Their bread and artichoke dip was a 10/10 but that's about it. I most likely won't be going back<//text>

The drinks🍹 are amazing (I had the Mai Tai), the appetizer (buffalo wings) were awesome! They had this outer crispiness that was so flavorful, I will definitely be getting those again! And the food was cooked to perfection! The steak 🥩was so tender and juicy and the lobster 🦞 was perfect!

We went as a group.  Everything was nice. It was nice to be able to go to a nice restaurant and be served inside. Our meeting room didn't have much ambiance. They brought straw cowboy hats to our people celebrating their birthdays and gave them a very good serving of vanilla ice cream.<//text>

The freshest sourdough bread in the Central Valley with the most amazing real butter.  Ribeye so tender and the Cowboy onions make a great salad and leftovers!  The baked potato is perfectly cooked, moist and filled with everything you would want.  Cody was an excellent server, he provided top notch service, pray you get him waiting your table!</Text>

<Text>4/13/2020 Thank you again for a great meal again.   Today was my birthday and being able to pick up this delicious meal made my day.

This is our families go-to place for a good steak and an all around satisfying family dinner.  It is the only place we will order a steak.   The service is excellent.  Servers our right there when you need something.  Everyone is so attentive and friendly.  It's nice when you can count on some things not changing.</Text>< rating>

Very good food and service. Manager came to our table to say hi and tell us if anything is not to our satisfaction to let him no. Drinks were good. Prime rib dip is delicious as well as the mother lode hamburger. Beef back ribs are very good.<//text>

Clean restaurant, friendly service, and the steaks were cooked almost just right. The food portions are generous but the drinks are a bit overpriced. I would say it's a good spot overall.</Text>

I still had to wait 15 minutes witha car full of dogs for my order.
Amanda was sure to apologize to the people behind me for being upset but what was my apology?!
Sometimes people spend $70 on an expensive meal to feel better about everything horrible going on. Wish my first experience here was as magical as I thought it would be.< /review>< Gmap_id>

I couldn't resist the urge to pass up this Cattleman's location. This is the 3rd location I've tried and by far this place had the best tasting 2lb mouth watering Sheriff Steak. We had the steak outside, since indoor dining is limited due to the new covid pandemic. Couldn't have made a better choice. If you are craving a steak don't wait until later or next time to have Cattleman's, do it NOW!< /review>

< Review>
Clean restaurant, friendly service, and the steaks were cooked almost just right. The food portions are generous but the drinks are a bit overpriced. I would say it's a good spot overall.</Review>

My experience here were the seats were torn our service well was very very rough I must say that the waitress was somewhat in a rush defeated a big party next to us and our food has small little steaks for what we paid for a family of four was ridiculous for the service that we got I would recommend that anybody who comes visits here please please tell the waitress about their service<//review>

<review>First time ever to this place as my brother wouldn't stop talking about it. He chose outside dining due to the COVID restrictions, and they sat us outside at a table that looked like they found in a shed with folding chairs that were messed up.
Once this was rectified and we were sat inside, the food was fantastic. The service was ok, but even my brother was disappointed.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x8094f03e54e050fd:0x28b03e1124014384<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Excellent service and high quality food... Best Restaurant in Fresno County!!! You will not be disappointed...Go with family, friends or co-workers.  It is the kind of place where you can celebrate any occasion.  Best salads, appetizers and bread...Their entrees are delicious.  You can select steak, salmon, ribs, chicken... and much more...<//Review>

Good bread, baked potatoes and beef ribs. Grilled shrimp came out cold (server said that's how it's normally served 🤔). Sent it back and shrimp was then warm, tasteless and rubbery. Daiquiri wasn't good. Spent a lot of money but definitely not worth it. Speed of service was good.<//Text>

I take my family to this restaurant  a lot! This is the best place to dine.  I visit this spot at least once a month. The meals are just great, the staff members are polite and the cost is good. I like being in this place to have a tasty meal.</Review>

<Text>Best place to come have a delicious steak! Drinks and desserts are also recommended. I absolutely love the bread and butter they give before your meal. Come prepared with a good appetite because your not going to want to miss a bite.</Text>< GmapID>

This is usually our favorite spot for the Dinner For 2 with the porterhouse with crab and lobster and went to celebrate Valentine's Day on Feb 16th hoping it wouldn't be too crowded. When we got there at 415pm it was quite busy. Our waitress was helpful, upbeat but very busy. She took our order, but as our items arrived it went from bad to worse. I asked for thousand island for my salad and got Italian and we asked for no onions and got onions. No big deal. I didn't want to bother the waitress as again, she was extremely busy. My coffee was served to me cold. The porterhouse was rare, not medium rare. The crab was super dry and over cooked and so was the lobster. We were stunned because everything is usually really good no matter which location we go to. Unfortunately, for $100, we decided from now on we'll stay in town instead of taking the 20 min trip out.</Text>

<review>Had a rough one tonight. Most of the time this place is on point. Tonight it missed heavily on everything. We came here for our 2 year anniversary. Wifes strawberry lemonaide was just pink water. Took them 15 minutes to come replace it. I gave her my soda in the mean time so she had something.  Ordered filet migon and they brought a ribeye.  On top of that we ordered loaded baked potatoes and they brought regular. So they brought replacements and it just had a huge spoonful of unmelted butter in it. Do not know if it was short staff or what because of covid but definetly not worth the $70 price tag<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Service was really good... That's as much as I could say for a good review the 45 minute wait on a  Wednesday night I was thinking the food would be really good... I was wrong.. The prime rib was dry and mealy... I've had better At sizzler... My dad's Alaskan king crab was the size of pencils.. Mom's lobster tail was like eating tire rubber... And girlfriends bacon wrapped shrimp was dry and tasteless Over cooked...  It's too bad  I was hoping for a really good dinner. I may not be a pro food critic but I know a decent meal when I taste one  And this was not it..! I haven't been in years now I remember why...</text>< Rating>

<Text>This is a great place to go for steak dinners in our area if you don't want to travel all the way out to Harris ranch or up to Fresno. The steak dinners and all of the sides are delicious the service is always friendly and they have a great bar and lots of parking.  Always Make sure you make Reservations ahead of time.<//Text>< pics>

We went there on Veterans Day and had reservations. I would recommend reservations for any weekend. The place is very busy. The steak was marvelous but the lobster was a bit tough. The service was exceptional.  The wait staff was friendly.  We have visited this restaurant much in the past, I cannot remember a bad steak or prime rib. The salad was fresh and not full of water as sometimes happens with a big bowl of lettuce.  We had a very enjoyable time.  I  can recommend this to any steak lover.  We will not be disappointed.< /review>

Nice American steakhouse. On previous visits I had steaks and was not disappointed 😉. Unfortunately, this time I chose the "healthier" shrimp and was quite disappointed. Tasteless, rubbery, veins in and overall unsatisfactory. Guess they should stick to their core competencies. Service was good and the endless salad is a nice feature.<//text>

What a great experience!  Liam by far is one of the best servers I have had the pleasure of meeting.   He definitely made it a fun evening.  The food met all expectations being from a reputable steak house!  Get the filet smothered in cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms.  To die for!</text>

Food is great!! Servers are very friendly! Never had a bad meal there and have always been happy with the staff. I recommend their haystack as an appetizer! My wife and I like ranch dressing with our haystack, but we went through the ranch they brought us, so I asked our server if we could have some more....she came back with a Gravy Boat full of ranch dressing...she smiled and said she likes ranch too👍👍</text>

<review>Service was absolutely horrible. We had to ask over and over for everything we ordered. We had to ask three times for salt and pepper!!!!! The bread never got there until after our food was delivered and we were almost finished eating. No one ever came to see if we were okay, we just had to flag then down. Food was okay but nothing we would recommend as special.< /review>< Pictures>

Service was really good... That's as much as I could say for a good review the 45 minute wait on a  Wednesday night I was thinking the food would be really good... I was wrong.. The prime rib was dry and mealy... I've had better At sizzler... My dad's Alaskan king crab was the size of pencils.. Mom's lobster tail was like eating tire rubber... And girlfriends bacon wrapped shrimp was dry and tasteless Over cooked...  It's too bad  I was hoping for a really good dinner. I may not be a pro food critic but I know a decent meal when I taste one  And this was not it..! I haven't been in years now I remember why...<//Text>

<Text>Tried this steakhouse while working in Fresno. It was highly recommended.
I only have it 4 stars because the service was very slow and the place was not very busy.
My rib-eye was cooked perfect.
The endless salad was of good quality and the sourdough table bread with butter was exceptional...just give people more butter than the single pat!
There are more of these restaurants scattered over the southwest so I would be sure to try one if the opportunity pops up!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I love this place for the great food and the amazing customer service all of the employees demonstrate. The steaks here are better than the "fancy steakhouses"... and you get a full meal. If you are lusting for a steak dinner, think Cattleman's!</Review>

<rate>3</rate><review>Went there to celebrate hubby's birthday. Our waiter didn't give us the all u can eat beans that is supposed to come with the meal. He also didn't tell us some of the sides had an extra charge. When we ordered, he asked what we wanted for our side & listed all the options, but again, failed to tell us that some of the sides he listed would cost extra. The food was mostly good, however, my daughter kept complaining her steak wasn't good; that it tasted like they didn't season it. Mine was great so I thought she was being picky. However, I finally tasted hers & it was true, it didn't seem like they seasoned it. Overall, we were more disappointed in the service. Unfortunately, if the service isn't good, then it ruins the whole experience. Therefore, only three stars.</review>< Pictures>

<rating>3</rating><review>It was pretty par for the course.  It's steak and that's great,  but I definitely didn't feel like it was worth spending 30 bucks on it. If I'm going to eat at a restaurant,  I need it to taste better than something I'd grill up at home.  I'm not a chef at all, but this just tasted like a steak.  Not a special steak.</review><Name>Philip Costales< /Name></record>

If I could give ZERO STARS  I would!! I Was just there for Father’s Day. Made a reservation for 6pm and when I arrived 10 mins earlier the host told me they were running behind! 8 other parties ahead of me. I waited in my car because there were crowds of people. 45mins later we got a text saying our table was ready. They sat us down .. then we waited another 40mins just for drinks!!! Our server was Megan and she was very stressed out. I could tell she couldn’t handle her section. We ordered my daughter’s food right away because who knew how long that was going to take. But when she took our order we order an appetizer and 2 entrées and drinks from the bar. When all of our food came out..I asked her why our app never came out.. she said “oh yeah..I’m sorry.” I told her forget it..Please take it off the bill!! And that’s all she had to say about it. We ordered steaks .. we had no salt, pepper, or A1!! She never came to check on us!!  My steak got cold by the time someone finally  brought this stuff to us. When I asked her for sour cream.. she literally dropped it and ran! I’ve been in the service industry and this service was horrible!! We didn’t even get a table touch from the manager. She could have turned it around if she offered to take care of desserts or discount on the bill. She didn’t care to make things right! I won’t be going back for awhile. They’re not fully staffed.. and because of that your experience and dinner will suffer for it! I’m leaving this review because I’ve been a manager of a restaurant and you'll never be able to fix this issue if you didn’t even know you had one to begin with.<//Review>

<Review>I waited 15 minutes for a table on a Friday night. It was worth it. The food is awesome. The plates range from $25 and up. Service is fantastic. It's a little loud making it difficult to talk to your partner at times but a good place to eat. I recommend this place.</Review><user>108792971838760370881<//user>< Rating>

We sat at 6:20 did not get food until 8:30 we were told they were backed up and that it be out shortly this is at 45 min. They said they'd send a manager that hadn't happened. At 8:00 a lead came and told us the manager swore cooking our food. When it came out our medium rare steaks were cold, tough, overcooked. We didn't even eat. This was so disappointing we live over an hour away and it was  our son's birthday. They offered to remake but we didn't have the.time to wait or the trust that it be.done quickly. Our meal was comp which well we didnt even eat it. Well instead the baked potatoes cause I was super hungry. Was planning on reserving Valentines but will be going elsewhere.< /Review>< response>

<review>My 1st visit to Cattleman's on Valentine's day. The place was slammed  and for good reason. The food is spectacular! My husband and I had the entree for two special for $70.00 which includes an appetizer, soup or salad,a side choice of mashed potatoes, pilaf, or baked potato and dessert. A lot of food! We had some large doggie bags! We couldn't eat it all. I had the prime rib. Only one word can describe it, perfection. Service was on point. Great casual atmosphere. Looking forward to my next visit.</review>< pics>

The food was excellent.  The service was outstanding.  The one complaint I have is the water tasted a lot like chlorine.  A restaurant of this stature and price should be using bottled water not tap water.<//review>

Came here for the first time and we really enjoyed our experience. We made sure to make a reservation and we were seated fairly quick. The food was amazing, our steaks where cooked they way we asked. The sides where also great. For our appetizer we had the trip tip tacos and they weren't bad. The cocktail portions are good for the price. Our servers were awesome and quick. We will definitely be coming back.< /text>

This place has a very laid back western atmosphere. The sirloin and lobster take was some of the best food I have ever had! I also really enjoyed the way that they celebrate birthdays by not only singing "Happy birthday" but also by giving the birthday boy/girl a cowboy hat to take home. This is an all around great place, the only reason I did not give 5 stars was due to very slow service. We had to constantly remind the server that we had ordered drinks and were still waiting, as well as remind her what drinks were ordered.<//Review>

I had the worst experience here, first off the food wasn't good. I had to send back my food twice and to top that someone broke into my truck. I was told by several people and employees that cars had been broken into all week. When the cops arrived they went to ask for the surveillance and they didn't not have cameras. Cattlemens has not done anything to insure the safety of their employees cars nor the customers. 😱😡👎<//Text>

Great steakhouse. Our server Jake was right on it. polite and very attentive. food was amazing. i recommend the 14 oz rib eye. we had a party of nine and we never had to ask for refills or bread. if you go on a Friday or weekend,  expect longer waits for everything. the wait is worth it. this steakhouse wil make any vegetarian cry.< /text>

This was a pleasant surprise. A few years ago I stopped eating meat, so even the occasional trip to Cattlemen ceased. But I joined a party and found that Cattleman had a very nice salmon available.  But aside from a very well prepared salmon dish, I was impressed with the service and the other meal choices. Good green salad served family style. The potatoes and other side dishes were excellent. Overall, I'm very pleased with Cattlemen Steakhouse.< /text>

I was really disappointed when I couldn't go to Cattlemen's for my birthday. So I am glad I found out that you can make reservations online. I am glad I did, because it was busy in there! Liam was an awesome server. He made sure to get my kid's food out first. The wait was a bit long for the adults food, but with bread, salad, and more delicious bread I'm not complaining. The bread is so good I could just eat that! My appetizer, artichoke dip, was yummy. My filet mignon and baked sweet potato were also so good! It is pricey, but worth it for a once in a while treat.<//text>

Bottomless fresh tasty salad. Flavorful but tired king crab. Toughest prime rib south of the Picket Wire. A generous cut, but not enjoyable. Baked potato was nice. Cheesecake very good. Fine service.<//review>

Great food and service. Get here early! They open at 4pm. If you wait until 5 or 6pm, especially on weekends and fridays, you'll be waiting awhile to be seated. The pork baby back ribs were good. Hope to be able to eat here again soon.</Review>

It is on the pricey side, just so you know and can be ready. They are good sized on the portions, and accommodating when you need to substitute for an allergy condition. Highly recommend making a reservation. It's not mandatory, but may be the only way to get served some nights.<//Text><Time>1545371659812</Time><response>None<//response>< UserId.>

Prior to CoVid19 cattleman's was a 5 star restaurant...now it's barely a 3 star restaurant...sorry but it's the truth the food has changed and not for the better.</Review>

Food is great!! Servers are very friendly! Never had a bad meal there and have always been happy with the staff. I recommend their haystack as an appetizer! My wife and I like ranch dressing with our haystack, but we went through the ranch they brought us, so I asked our server if we could have some more....she came back with a Gravy Boat full of ranch dressing...she smiled and said she likes ranch too👍👍</Review>

We waited about 15 to 20 minutes to be seated which was not bad at all. Right after we were seated our waitress Ashley Botello was just awesome she recommended a drink that was excellent she was very courteous ride our dinner tour table right away it was excellent. She came to our table three or four times check on us asked us if we needed anything. Totally recommend this place our dinner was excellent customer service was great thank you Ashley for making the night a great night.</Text>

Large dishes with good quantity of food. Pricey establishment. Suggested dinner reservations especially for weekends.  No reservations than sit in the bar-restaurant area.  Clean environment and excellent service.  The pre meal fresh baked bread is delicious.</text>

The food was all awesome. I just got a sirloin, but it's the best steak I've had; definitely better than Chili's or Applebees, and better than Outback Steakhouse as well. The only place I've had better was Ruth's Chris, but that's also much more expensive. The atmosphere and decor are great. Bread and beans are free and unlimited, and most meals come with salads. I knocked off one star because the service was very slow. I'm not sure if maybe that's kind of normal here because of the way they do food, but it was kind of annoying.</text>

< Review>
Husband and I went for my birthday. The second we walked in, we were seated.  As soon as we were seated they placed warm bread and butter on our table.  We skipped the appetizers and ordered our dinner. I ordered the steak and shrimp.  He ordered Pete's Special.  Our meals came with all you can eat salad, our choice of side, and beans.  We must of been having a great time. It only seemed like minutes after we ordered that we got our meal.  Every item that was ordered was delicious! It was one of the most satisfying meals we had in a long time.  The service was great.  The atmosphere is country cozy.  Definitely a place we will be visiting again.< /Review>

I felt like the service was really good. My family celebrated my great-grandfather's 80th birthday today. We had a party of 25 people and we had only one server helping us. He did a great job but it probably would have been easier to serve us if he had someone helping him.  My food was delicious i got a specialty hamburger. My brother and sister ordered t-bone steaks and they were a little substandard. One was severly charred and one tasted a little like soap. Over all it was okay<//review>

<time>1565134220826<//time><Rating>4<//Rating><review>Good food, but it's a good idea to make a reservation as the wait can be long. Our last visit was on Fathers Day. We had a reservation, so we got seated right away. The apps came out fast, but our order got held up by a long time. It was really busy, so I cut them some slack, but it ended up taking a really long time. People seated after us ate and left before we got our food. Our server was really nice and apologized a lot. He made it right at the end, so I'm not going to ding them with a bad review because they usually aren't that slow. I'm chalking it up to it being Fathers Day.</review>< pics>

<Review>I also saw employees eating food off people's plates after they left. The food was pretty good so I guess I can't blame them too much. Service was a bit odd... Almost too much attention. I'm glad they kept coming by to see how we were doing but they didn't need to constantly interrupt with small chat and questions not related to the meal. I good place to go if you like the western theme and good food.</Review>< Pictures>

It seems like they forgot it in the oven and toasted the cheese too much. It was burnt around the edges and stuck to the dish. Has anyone ordered this entree before?

It beats the fancier places up in River Park by a mile, better food, better serving staff, one of the best steakhouses by far.< /Text>

Drinks were not mixed well and bar service was terribly slow, again, my bet is not enough coverage. My group also appreciated the value. The selection, and cook quality was on par with more expensive steakhouses we've been to.< /Review>< Pictures>

Disappointed. There was four of us for dinner with two of the three steaks over cooked. The one steak that was ok had a large strip of fat and gristle along the edge.  They brought one meal out and it took over 10 minutes for the remaining meals to come with two needing to be sent back. We had to ask for beverages and they refilled one with the wrong drink. They did give us two free desserts but we asked for coffee with the dessert and didn't get it until the dessert was about gone. This was the second time the food wasn't that good for an expensive $125 meal for four. Not worth the money.<//Review>

Good food if they get the order right. We've been there many times and I'm particular about how my steak is cooked. I would say 30% of the time, my steak will not be cooked to order and often have to have it cooked more. Last night I switched steaks with my son even though they were different cuts because mine was under done and his was over done.....besides that....the food is great...if the order is done correctly.<//review>

Wow, the steaks are great! And you'd better come with a big appetite! Our meals came with all-you-can-eat salad and bread. Expect a lobby-full of people ahead of you at dinnertime on weekends. Service was friendly but a little hit-or-miss, possibly due to the influx of dinnertime patrons at the time. Not sure.< /text>

The Sourdough bread here is home made and extremely soft and fresh. I ordered the T-Bone which was cooked to perfection and my girlfriend ordered the butternut squash which I had a taste of and I thought it was cooked perfectly as well. The garlic mashed potatoes that come as a side are amazing. There is also a lovely ambience here that just makes you feel at home and welcome. 5 stars all around</text>< pics>

The steaks are made to perfection and the lobster tail is tender, sweet and so far, never over cooked. Make sure you get the twice baked potatoes!
The last two times we've got the dinner for two. There's so much food that dessert has to be to-go!<//Text>< user>

So if you'd like to wait at LEAST 30 mins. after your reservation time, this is the place.  My time is worth more than an overpriced meal, no matter how good it is.<//text>< pictures>

Had a group dinner. The service people need to ask their customers who wants butter, A1 sauce, sour cream, etc -prior- to the arrival of their main dish. One should not have to wait for butter while their potato gets cold or A1 sauce for a cold steak. Employees were friendly and the food tasted great.  We will be back.< /text>

<Text>The service was great, all the food except the steak was also great which is the reason for the second star. To elaborate on the steak it was not cooked correctly, covered in onion strings which was hiding the fact that it had absolutely no grill or char marks on one side of the steak. The other side had partial grill marks going one direction only that tells me they never turned my steak on the one side. Not sure how the side with no grill marks was cooked but it looked like is was cooked in a pan with low heat. The restaurant was not busy (they had just opened on a Sunday afternoon) so this being my first time eating at this steak house i was super unimpressed. I will probably give this place one more try and if that doesn't pan out ill never be back. We spent over 120 dollars (just my wife and I) on this dinner with the expectations of having an amazing steak dinner and we were both greatly disappointed.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>NAPKIN POLICE!!! Came here for a special dinner with my family and spent well over $200. The cloth napkins are dirty and used so we asked for paper napkins instead. The waitress said she had to get permission from the manager to give us paper napkins!! Finally the manger shows up with NO JOKE, exactly 1 single paper napkin for each of us! He said the paper napkins are very costly at about 30 cents each so they only offer them to high paying customers< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Stopped on our way to Lancaster for the holidays as we had a great experience a little over a month ago.  Got the Cowboy steak and my wife got the steak and lobster.  Both were perfect!

Best part was having Michelle as our waitress.  She was prompt, courteous, pleasant and always had a smile.  We sat in the bar which can be hectic on Friday nights, let alone during the holiday season.  It did not waiver her attitude a bit, very professional!

We will definitely be stopping again if driving through during dinner time.< /Text>

Had a group dinner. The service people need to ask their customers who wants butter, A1 sauce, sour cream, etc -prior- to the arrival of their main dish. One should not have to wait for butter while their potato gets cold or A1 sauce for a cold steak. Employees were friendly and the food tasted great.  We will be back.<//Text>

The food was spiced well, but the cut was extremely fatty. All you can eat salad and bread redeemed quite a bit though. Overall the place is good, but I don't think it is justified by the price.</Review>

WOW! This place, though. Let me being by saying this restaurant was beautiful in and out. It was my first time being here. I was in awe, we did have to wait a. While for the food. But man did it was worth waiting for my order. They being with the appetizers, then some salad. Then for the big reveal my plate of steak. (Which was so good btw) when I was finally done, they asked me for dessert and waited patiently I received a beautiful slice of cheesecake!!!<//Text>

Waste of time, wait was too long, food was dry, the ranch style beans were pinto beans seasoned with really tart spices, the steak was tough, the baby back ribs were very dry as well as the baked potatoes, the salad after onions were removed  could still be tasted, very overpriced.
Do not go off the beaten trail, not worth it, go to the Dog House Sports Grill in Fresno, great tri tip and excellent prices!</Text>

<Review>We did the Valentine's dinner...sirloin with lobster tail and all the fixings. It was delicious meal. This is your second time here during Valentine's Day, reservations is a must, waited no more than 5 min. Nice place servers are fast, nice,didn't wait long for our food. The only thing I would have liked was dessert considering we paid $70+ not including tip. We'll be going again probably every Valentine's day. 😊❤< /Review></record>

1st time for my wife and I after seeing the sign from travelling the Hwy 99...
Big full parking lot did bother us since we had a reservation. But being handed the light up buzzer and waiting outside did bother us...
Large parties kept our server delayed to attend to us...
The salad/bleu cheese dressing and the sourdough bread, beans and twice baked potatoes were worth the wait but wife's salmon and my rib-eye steak needed help in the flavor dept...
We might give them another try but will stick with an appetizer and salad/bread...< /Text>

<Review>As a as a regular at this restaurant and long time Selma resident I have to say that I am not happy with what this place has become. In my opinion the food has been on a decline for a while now but that was always substituted by excellent service, but this was not my experience recently. Our server Josh was extremely rude, did not make eye contact once while taking our order, seem to be inconvenienced and annoyedat our request for anything. I thought someone at our table might have offended him so I asked our group if anyone knew him, no one did but everyone noticed the attitude. This will be the last time at Cattleman's for my family and myself.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Sorry to say, but it was not a good experience.  This was not the fault of the service.  I don't know what happened in the kitchen. Of our party of ten, one person's dinner baby back ribs was burnt which cause a delay, another's dinner raviolis was delayed later than the ribs and the 3rd dinner beef ribs had to be boxed to go because it was so delayed.  However there was no charge for these dinners. Their food is good but I wanted my steak well done but it wasn't.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Got the Cowboy steak and my wife got the steak and lobster.  Both were perfect!

Best part was having Michelle as our waitress.  She was prompt, courteous, pleasant and always had a smile.  We sat in the bar which can be hectic on Friday nights, let alone during the holiday season.  It did not waiver her attitude a bit, very professional!

We will definitely be stopping again if driving through during dinner time.</review></record></dataset><record>

Our server SAYA gave us outstanding service! The food/steak is well seasoned and cooked to perfection of our liking! Everyone is extremely friendly with great big smiles! A great team Cattlemen has! Love this place & definitely recommend it!

*Advice for first timers, make a reservation & come on time because they are ALWAYS packed & busy! Enjoy!<//Review>

I have been to this steakhouse a few times and my favorite dish is the sheriff as it is a 2lb steak which is super savory.< /Review>

Good prices, great food, service is awesome. Atmosphere is fun, they sing for birthdays and anniversaries.  Can get a little loud so not really a place for someone looking for a quiet dining experience.<//text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Very good food, though sometimes they may tend to over cook steaks. Service is always top notch. I drive from Madera to eat there, lobster is usually very good and bacon wrapped shrimp is a must. The place is in desperate need of a remodel though, especially the very old carpet.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I had such a great time at dinner tonight.  I got the bacon wrapped shrimp and a steak that was cooked to perfection! I loved the endless bread and salad.  Also Jessica G. went above and beyond during the entire meal.  i have a huge family and I hate taking them out to eat because they can be messy and loud.  Jessica took care of us! thank you Jessica.  I cant wait to come back here again!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Stuffed mushroom awesome, as well as the baked mashed potatoes smothered in cheese, bacon, and sour cream.
The meat on the other hand.... not impressed at all. Which is why you go here. Probably wont be back. Not for the price. Can buy a better piece of rib eye at B&L Meats in Visalia and have my fiance grill it better then they can!<//Text>

The food is great, big portions of quality food, good mixed drinks, excellent wine selection.
But the service really made this the fun and satisfying experience this was. Our server Leah really was the cherry on top for our visit. It wouldn't have been the same without her.
She was funny, bubbly, cute and really an amazing server. She did mention that service hasn't always been the greatest, but they have a new manager now and he's a really nice guy. Unfortunately, she did mention that she's leaving soon :(

I definitely recommend this place regardless though, we WILL be coming back.< /text><UserId.>107482770517523165617<//UserId.></record>

We made reservations for 6 and were seated right away.  The table was in the middle of one of the dining areas.  Immediately I knew seating was going to be tight.  Our party had 4 adults, my 12 year old grandson and 8 year old grandson.  We stood there trying to figure out where to sit 6 people at a table suitable for 4 adults.  We finally settled in.  The service was exceptional.  We ordered appetizers.  The shoe string onions were cold.  Then our salad arrives and were are trying to make room for in the middle of the table.  Our dinner arrives.  My New York and my daughter inlaws Filet Mignon are cooked well not medium as ordered.  The beef ribs off the childrens menu are huge and apparently cooked hours before they were served and mostly bone with very little beef.  I ordered broccoli as my side and it was cold.  Our bill came to 186.68 which I paid for and a $35.00 tip was left for the waiter.  We were celebrating my son's 38th birthday and it was he choice to dine there.  I only gave 3 stars because the service was good not the food.<//Text>

Came here for dinner on Easter with a party of 5 and although the restaurant wasn't crowded, got placed at a table designed for 4. Service was slow and some of the food arrived late and cold. Steaks and prime rib were tasty but on the fatty side. This would probably be a 2 star review but giving an extra star considering it was Easter and likely short staffed.< /text>

<Time>1506652852692<//Time><rating>1</rating><review>We heard this place was very good. We went for my husband's bday and we were not satisfied. The service was very poor. Our waitress did not bother to ask if we needed refills. We complained about our steak having excess fat and our waitress ignored us and slowly walked away. It was very awkward. There was a few times that she would walk right pass our booth and ask other customers how they were doing and didnt acknowledge us. The only time we seen a big smile was when we got handed the tab. It was extremely pricey. I do have to say the brownie and cookie desert was good. The sirloin steak that we had was average. We were handed nearly empty A1 sauce and ketchup.This is our first and last time visiting this place. I hope everyone else dining in would have a better experience.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>The staff is super friendly. There is however a long wait time Friday and Saturday nights for tables and booths. The bar area gets super packed as well on those days. Food is kinda over priced for what it is. Even happy hour prices for food is over priced.<//Review>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Tonight a group of me and my co workers went to celebrate a birthday and this being my first time ever coming here I couldn't wait for the experience. Well just no this was my first and last time I will be visiting this establishment!!   We had reservations at 730pm didn't get seated until almost 830pm and the server has attitude from the beginning and fail to tell us that they were out of alot of items. I don't see how a restaurant that is open only 5 hours a day can't provide enough food for the night. And when a steak is ordered rare come straight out of the refrigerator cold as hell. And when you tell the manager he could careless. I guess I will just stick to the taco trucks on the side of the road were you get awesome food and way better service for half the PRICE!! If your wondering what location that if you guys have more Selma👎</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
We made a reservation for 17  Saturday at 7:00 a few days before our event. When we all arrived they lost our reservation, we had our email confirmation and they said it would be 15 min. An hour later still no table... We had little ones with us who were hungry...we would of left but where in Selma could you get dinner at 8:00 pm for 17. 8:15 we were seated. 8:30 they finally took our drink order. 8:45 we got our drinks. 9:30 we got our dinner which was overpriced for the quality of food and the steak was cold.We left the restaraunt at 10:00pm  without any discount or apology for our inconvenience. We will not be going back.< /Review>

I called same day to make a reservation for 5 at 630pm. We showed up and were promptly seated. The staff was friendly and attentive. In our party we had my parents both retired snd over 55, my wife and I both in our late twenties and early 30s and a 12 year old child. There was choices for everyone. My wife and I loved our meal although my wifes steak was medium well and she ordered well done, the steaks had great flavor. The child enjoyed his food, my mothers steak salad was not impressive to her, she felt the meat was too tough. My father over all liked his steak but felt it had to much fat on it. Deserts were all great, the  new york cheesecake is great, about 4 inches thick and very fluffy. Over all a great dinning experience. Had everyone in my party been impressed i would have rated 5 stars.<//review>

Overall it was good. The service was stretched thin. Our sever was overwhelmed??, but she tried to make things right.  2 out of 3 steaks were right on the money, the third was tough and lacked flavor.  Everything else was great.< /Review>

<Text>We recently celebrated our mother's 70th birthday here. While the servers were very polite, they obviously don't have the staff to handle the crowd they get. We were sat in the corner of very back room(there were 11 of us). I am disabled, but I was able to squeeze in between the wall and table.
Our drink & appetizer orders were promptly taken, but I was never offered a refill the entire time (though my brother who was sitting right next to me was offered one, even though my cup was empty and his was half full). I figured I'd ask for a refill when she brought his back, but she pretended to not hear me when I started talking to her. I guess the eye contact and my moving lips threw her for a loop.
The chicken I bought was rubbery and not worth the price at all.  The mashed potatoes were dry and chock-full of very stale chives or green onions that was like chewing cud.
Thankfully my mother appeared to be enjoying her meal, and never needed a refill or any extras.
I also asked two seperate servers for a straw and never received one(even though I later noticed most servers had them in their apron).
All in all, it seems I was ignored because I was sitting at the end of the table, and therefore an inconvenience for the servers to bother paying attention to.
I didn't complain because I wanted my mom to have the perfect day, and she was having a good time(though she later told me her steak was very tough). But my brothers noticed the staff ignoring me, as did the family at the neighboring table. They even apologized to me because they felt bad(the family, not the servers).

On the way out, as I was slowly making my way through the crowd near the entrance, a Cattlemens employee quickly walked right in front of me, kicking my crutch out from under me and didn't even stop. If it wasn't for a man who was waiting to be seated who jumped up and helped me stay on my feet, I'd have fallen hard. It was really quite embarrassing.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Favorite steakhouse. Usually come about 2 to 3 times a month. If you have a big party make sure you set a reservation. Even if it's 2 people call ahead you'll save time and won't have to wait. They have different deals during the week.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Horrible lobster, steaks were fatty, lamb was cold and mixed veggies has onion in it, worst dinner here in a long time, not going back anytime soon. Random guy delivering steak to dinner wanted to bet my husband $200 that it was the best steak ever.< /Text>

The service was very poor. Our waitress did not bother to ask if we needed refills. We complained about our steak having excess fat and our waitress ignored us and slowly walked away. It was very awkward. There was a few times that she would walk right pass our booth and ask other customers how they were doing and didnt acknowledge us. The only time we seen a big smile was when we got handed the tab. It was extremely pricey. I do have to say the brownie and cookie desert was good. The sirloin steak that we had was average. We were handed nearly empty A1 sauce and ketchup.This is our first and last time visiting this place. I hope everyone else dining in would have a better experience.</Text>< Pictures>

The staff is super friendly. There is however a long wait time Friday and Saturday nights for tables and booths. The bar area gets super packed as well on those days. Food is kinda over priced for what it is. Even happy hour prices for food is over priced.< /Text>

First, it took our waiter 15 minutes to bring out drinks, and another 15 minutes for a refill of water, that we requested 4 times. The fried onion appetizer and salad tasted good. I ordered a ribeye, that was dry and didn't taste that great. There were four of us, naturally we all ordered steaks, they were all dry and tasted okay. The service was awful, in my opinion not tip worthy, it shouldn't take 15 minutes to refill a water cup, the waiter walked passed our table plenty of times and not once offered a refill. Long experience short, we will had more fun talking about the bad service and won't be returning for a second chance. If I'm going to pay money for a steak I want it to taste good.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x8094f03e54e050fd:0x28b03e1124014384< /gmapID></record>

A lot of people i know say this place is really good. So i went there for the first time and i thought it was ok. I order a Filet Mignon and i didn't expect for it to be charbroiled. I'm not a fan of that. But i will say the tender. The flavor was not there for me.</text>

<review>First they stuck us in the back kids room with screaming kids out of control..... parents were complaining and letting their unruly kid scream to high heaven.  No excuse...... destroyed my whole evening with my son.

2nd. The food was all late getting to the table.  The other guests were already half done or all the way through their dinner before they brought me my food.

3rd.  Once the food arrived it looked like it was frozen chicken that they smothered in sauce.  They must have sent someone out to get chicken wings somewhere else like a 7 eleven or something ? Sucked big time.

4th.  Then they forgot my soms lobster..... what a joke.

5th. The the manager looking like straight up Mexican Cartel members approached our table and acted as if everything was alright even though they did not comp the meails.  Walked out with $ 165.00 tab, left a $3.00 tip.

6th.  I'll never go back unless they change cooks and managers.

Please make sure that you consider all other options before going to the Cattlemans again..... I got sick after returning home, so i am sure they put something in my food.

<text>Food was ok, employees were something else. We sat next to the kitchen entrance and wow. Employees were eating off of people's plates before they went out to the table. Employees were locking there fingers before grabbing the plates. I mean wow, and the head chef was just standing around doing the same thing. Will not, definitely will not return, we felt grossed out.<//text>< Date>

Just a tad over priced for what we got. Ordered a Mohito, bar has no business making one all they did was add ice a sprig of mint in a highball glass and add 1oz rum and soda water. No crush in the mint in the bottom of the glass after adding  sugar, or. and lime to release the flavor. Tasted just like bad soda water. THEN we waited and waited and they never brought our cowboy beans! Brought both to their attention and to get the FULL bill, no correction​ what so ever. Bad....< /text>

If your craving steaks you go here. Dont go to flemings or ruth crisp and spend an arm and a leg where you can go here for half the price and enjoy a better steak with good service.< /text>

I went with my husband Under the Legarreta reservation the service was horrible, the waitress was so unprofessional,  our steaks were then half fat, this is first time we were unsatisfied with Cattlemen's,  it was so so DISAPPOINTING,  IT WAS OUR FIRST TIME TAKING OUR GRANDSON WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND WE WERE SO EMBARRASSED BY THEIR SERVICE AND QUALITY OF FOOD< /Review>

Incredible dining experience, I couldn't find anything wrong.
Great food, filet mignon was perfect, every part of the meal was perfect.
Excellent service, my server Nic took care of me proper, very attentive & on point.
Well, worth the money...

I'll be back for sure.<//Text>

Love Cattlemans! The service is always good, food is fabulous (I always order the filet mignon). It takes awhile to get a cocktail in the bar if you are waiting for a table on a busy night, but overall this place is great!</Review>

<Time>1531720748160< /Time><Rating>3< /Rating><text>Our group of six ate here for a birthday dinner on a Thursday evening. This place stays very busy since is the only steakhouse for miles.Three of us ordered prime rib with twice baked potato (tbp), one had a filet with tbp, one had a ribeye with tbp, and one had ribs with fries.
The prime rib and steaks were cooked as desired, but all lacked flavor compared to Texas Roadhouse steaks. The twice baked potatoes were over seasoned for three of us, the other two didn't notice.
Server was friendly but took too long between courses even considering how busy they were. At the end we had to chase down our server to get a bill so we could leave.
We consider Cattlemans to be over priced for what you get. They do a great business as they are the only steakhouse for miles,but we won't be back.<//text>< Pictures>

Ordered the father's day special today. The chicken was really dry, the tri-tip was stringy, and it was a very poor value for the price. Don't plan on going back.<//text></record>

Waiter charged me for a tip on my card without knowledge and took the cash I handed him for the tip without telling me they charge your card for a tip. Horrible service all around. Mash potatoes were cold when I got my food. Horrible experience would not reccomend this restraunt at al< /Review>< Pictures>

Cattlemans has really stepped up on customer service & food lately. We drive all the way from Visalia to get a good steak. Sure, we have a few steakhouse here in Visalia but they're no comparison to Cattlemans in Selma. Kudos to Jose and his team.< /review>

< review>
I've seen a lot if reviews for this restaurant, so I thought it would be the best pick for my son's 22nd bday party.. Boy was I WRONG! In the middle of SUMMER, the thermostat was set at 85°F, the steaks didn't have ANY seasoning on them, the JUMBO shrimp were a lot more like MEDIUM BUTTERFLIED shrimp! My daughter in laws shrimp scampi was NOT scampi. For anyone that hasn't been to Cattlemens, but wants to check it out, you can get WAY BETTER at The Outback or Tahoe Joe's or even Cool Hand Luke's! Cattlemens SUCKS! LITERALLY! IF U DON'T KNOW WHAT A GOOD STEAK IS, CATTLEMENS IS YOUR PLACE!<//review>

<text>The waitress taking our drink order didn't know what grand Marnier was. The berry mojito tasted horrible. We asked for pinot noir and she came back what kind of rum do you want with that? The steak that was ordered was the boneless rub  eye steak and we got a steak with a bone.everytime the waitress made a mistake she would rub his shoulder and say I'm sorry. We won't be back!!<//text>< GmapID>

Took about an hour for food to be served and at that food was cold. Managment wasnt great at all. They had mixed up our orders twice untill the third time they finally got it right. After an hour and fourty minutes we finally ate. Worst experience.</review>

The waitress taking our drink order didn't know what grand Marnier was. The berry mojito tasted horrible. We asked for pinot noir and she came back what kind of rum do you want with that? The steak that was ordered was the boneless rub  eye steak and we got a steak with a bone.everytime the waitress made a mistake she would rub his shoulder and say I'm sorry. We won't be back!!</Text>

<review>Took about an hour for food to be served and at that food was cold. Managment wasnt great at all. They had mixed up our orders twice untill the third time they finally got it right. After an hour and fourty minutes we finally ate. Worst experience.< /review><user_id>100050766954768357395< /user_id>< resp>

Started off by getting drinks at the bar. Was ignored by three staff, one bartender was actually directly in front of us polishing wine glasses. Meanwhile my date and I sat until they finally decided to get us a drink ( there was nobody else at the bar mind you). Worst watered down drink I've ever had. I asked for a double and couldn't even taste any alcohol. Then our buzzer went off so we could be seated and I couldn't be happier. We sat down and ordered a two person dinner. Appetizer never came until it was asked for ( which was after our meal arrived) and the meal was barely luke warm. Also for it being a "steak house" the steaks were less than an inch thick. My date got the fillet which was not a round cut of meat (which I thought was a general characteristic of a filet ). Bad service all around. I used to go to Cattlemans growing up and I thought it was a special place. Sad to see that it is being run like this. Seems like managment doeant care about quality anymore. Will not be going back anytime soon.</Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Text>horrible dinner last night 10/10/14.
we had 7:30 pm reservations for my wife and myself, got sat in a booth and pretty much forgotten about. about 8 pm a waiter finally came by and introduced himself and left. long story short, we had bread with no water or beverages from the bar that we ordered for a long time. then he took our order and tells me they are out of prime rib after i order it. i then ordered a rib eye steak rare and the wife ordered triple threat brochettes medium. we still dont have water. dinner comes out, the wifes dinner was a obviously a combination of at least 2 different cooking attempts, half was well done and the other was raw, mine was a medium but do able. her baked sweet potato and my baked potato both needed another 20+ minutes in the oven, very hard and not a soft baked potato at all.
i talked to the manager 2 times but he was difficult to understand at best and he suggested i call him before coming next time and he will save me a piece of prime rib, really?
it was friday payday, how can they be out of prime rib at that time and the service was horrible.
we usually have a good dinner there but last night was rather upsetting.
i think it will be Black Angus next time. its cheaper anyway and alot closer.
we spent close to $100 and had to go to McDonalds when we were done!<//Text><UserId.>109602952386381195363< /UserId.>< rate>

They have horrible  service,and they also take way to long to bring your food and the waiters don't even bring all of your drinks and I would order anything on,the menu and they also take to long to bring your check, I would not recommend this place to eat at.< /review>
