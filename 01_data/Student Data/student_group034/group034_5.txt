I rarely give five stars, but this place has great food.

I  toying with the idea of going vegan, so I'm looking around for  vegan options. I discover this place. Four out of seven items on their menu are vegetarian, and could become vegan with a couple of special requests.

You won't miss the meat, and they have two chicken options of you insist on that sort of protein.

I hope they are a success and open more restaurants. The only one that stays open for dinner is at Figueroa and 7th. The other two are only open for lunch.<//Text>

<Review>Food served here is sublime. The staff here are friendly. This is an all you can buffet, where the food comes to you. Vegetarian food and some curries might be little on sweet side.

The ambience is good but the food tasted average. I'm used to more spicy food. The buttermilk is best thing you can get. The dessert varieties are not great.</Review>

Their potatoes are huge and honestly worth it's price. I wouldn't suggest getting your own if you just want a snack. The combinations a pretty weird but they work well together. I got the steak spud and I was just  couldn't really finish it by myself though.<//Text>

I get the channa masala bowl and I love it.  Fresh, masaledar and comes with freshly copped onions on top - feels like home.

The mango lassi and samosas are good too.  I like their green chutney - the yellow/orange one is good too.   Lines seem long sometimes, but they move along very fast.<//Review>

As a "noob" of Indian cuisine I cannot speak to the authenticity of the food, I can only speak to what it tastes like on my palate.  I basically stick to the Chicken Masala or the Chicken Curry.  Both wonderful dishes on their own and in combination of the garlic naan that they have.  There are pros and cons to the chicken curry though.  The chicken is cooked thru a little better so the chicken is more tender and moist but if you are going into a client meeting in the afternoon, don't eat it for lunch.

Hot and Cool
Be aware, the spicy sauce, drum roll please......is freakin' spicy.  Go figure right? A spicy sauce that is finally spicy.  A little too spicy I may say, but it may be awesome for more manly men than me.  The good thing is, there's also a cool minty sauce to cool down your tongue if you accidently add too much spicy sauce!</text></record>

If you are looking for chicken tikka masala or chickpea curry on the go in Downtown LA, this is the place for you. They are fast, convenient and the service is always nice and friendly. They also offer vegetarian options with their tofu masala or curry. I'm always a sucker for their plain naan too. While it doesn't offer the wide variety and expertise of a typical sit-down Indian restaurant, I definitely go to this place for a quick lunchtime eat.<//text>

<review>The chicken tikka masala is my favorite bowl of them all.  You get a reasonable helping of chicken and sauce on top of rice that makes for a satisfying lunch.  The basmati rice is slightly mushy but it's good enough.  The chicken is grilled breast white meat and you can see the grill marks and it is tasty.  The sauce keeps the chicken from getting dry and it has good flavor as well.

Nan bread has that doughy consistency with flaky crisp edges that go well with the tikka masala sauce.

This place always has a line so you can tell it's popular with the regulars.</review></record>

I dropped my coffee getting in my car (complete sadness), refusing to start my day like that, I went back for another one and they didn't charge me! So sweet to do such a courtesy.  Great customer service! (Crew on 9/17 in the morning).</review>

<review>It's kind of a shame that the only Starbucks in this particular area is so small and in a horrible geographical location.

The drive-thru is the worst part, this place was not designed with a drive-thru in mind so having one here results in a giant line every single morning. The other issue is that the place inside is in general very cramped and small, again creating huge lines and making it a very uncomfortable place to sit and enjoy your beverage and/or use your electronics.</review><date>1542779688661< /date><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

It’s been getting worse, but today was bad! I made my order as usual, after waiting quite a few minutes for the lady doing the dishes to finally come to the counter, with chocolate covered hands. She never put my cup in order for the barista, but after seeing multiple other customers be served, even those after me, I realized she never corrected the problem. I brought it to the barista’s attention and was met with attitude, being told that she didn’t have a cup for my order. I explained that I oroit and paid for it, so it needed to be made. She just shrugged her shoulders and continued making everyone else’s drinks. I had to approach her again, when yet again I was met with attitude, being told, ok I’ll make it now. This is horrible customer service. The second I told her that she missed my order, she should’ve stopped the others that were after me and started making mine, rather than giving me attitude. To top it off, the lady that took my order said, I think someone took it, even though I had been standing there the whole time watching every drink come out. Why would someone have taken it if she didn’t even have it in line in the first place?? Nice taking responsibility for your initial mistake! Nothing was done to make the situation better either. She finally just plopped my drink on the counter and gave me the stink eye. Unbelievable.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

It was nice to see the fossils and learn some new things about paleontology. My son is an enthusiast so he was excited to go. I think it could have been a little more for them to see and do but overall great experience<//review>

< Review>
It was closed the day I visited, but from the other reviews it looks like I didn't miss much. Almost all the exhibits are outside the locked doors and are available to view in the zoology building. Some had information, most just a name. I loved seeing the Tyrannosaurus up close. There were several other skulls and a few other skeletons. Another highlight for me was the cast of Lucy, the hominid found by Dr Leaky and his team that inspired so many people's interest in anthropology. It isn't a very big place, and as interested as I was, I only spent a couple of hours. Several tour groups came through spending more like 10 or 15 minutes. It's a place to visit if you are interested and near the campus, but I wouldn't call it a destination into itself.<//Review>

<review>Not really a museum. There were few nice casts of dinosaur skeletons and some triceratops heads. But they are just in a lobby area. And no signage to help you find it.</review><name>Sydney Osborne</name></record>

NOT a museum, most were replica displays. Don’t go if you’re looking for a real museum. Shouldn’t be advertised to the public as a museum of paleontology since access is for research staff only.<//Review>

It's technically a museum but not really. You will, however, see a full T-Rex skeleton in the stairwell area of a prominent science building at a beautiful college campus.< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It's not really a museum, it's just a space for dinosaur fossils in the atrium of the UC Berkeley Science Museum. However, if you are visiting UC Berkeley's itinerary, it is a must-see attraction! Quiet and bold entry into the Science Museum building is right!

(Original)
不是真的博物館，為UC Berkeley生科館中庭的恐龍化石展示空間而已。但是若是參觀UC Berkeley的行程，則是必拍景點喲！安靜的大膽的進入生科館大樓就對了！</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Although it represents a time of war and hardship, I am glad to see we have something in our little town that in our way show respect and gratitude for our men and women in arms. God bless those men and women, we owe them so much for what they do for us by serving, & protecting  our Country.  God Bless United States of  America.< /Review>

<Text>Really nice memorial, cool tank. Seems to be restored with maube plaster or bondo, but really neat. Seems like homeless community leaves junk underneath, but otherwise well kept and monitored.< /Text>< Pictures>

Very nice grassy area to walk through. If interested in the military, this would be a great place to check out. A couple monuments and tank. Not really a place for kids since there isn't much to entertain them with.< /Text>

One of the best places to buy live coral frags.  Not very big but very good selection of SPS, LPS including montis and zoanthids etc.  Small but good selection of reef safe fish as well.  I've bought several pieces over the past eight months: maxima clam, pink Montipora, favia, acropora, anacropora, clove polyps, ice fire echinata and trachyphyllia.  I have not lost one piece, all were very healthy and remain that way.</text>

Visited the store for the first time to buy some Aragonite for my African cichlid  tank and had the pleasure of meeting Jason. He was very helpful and answered a bunch of my questions. This place is one of LA's hidden gems. Will definitely go back for more supplies going forward 👍 Tell all your friends, I know I will.</text>

<text>Great Store, Good Selection, Nice People and Fair Prices.
One thing I was surprised about upon bringing the frags home was the amount of Aiptasia I found on them. Aiptasia is always a bit of a red flag when it comes to deciding who to buy frags from, but its pretty hard to avoid when you have as many frags as they do. I didn't notice many other pests on the frags but there was definitely a few things I saw coming off during the dip and is the reason for not giving 5 stars. Other then that I was very impressed and will most likely be going back.</text>< Name>

This place is so awesome. The owner goes above and beyond for his customers even offers help through text message if you need it. I drive over 100 miles just to come to this store. They have a large selection of corral and fish. Totally recommend this store to anyone with a slat water tank!</Review>

<text>#1 place for corals. We religiously shop here on a weekly basis. Their prices are incredible and their selection of corals are out of this world. It’s the only place we will get our Saltwater and RO/DI water. Never had any pest in our corals and haven’t gotten a sick fish there too.The owners are friendly and will help you with any questions that you might have. Can’t wait for the new store to open.< /text><rating>5</rating><user_id>111674460519219150600<//user_id>< GmapID>

<review>Staff puts customer service and professionalism first, a great representation of the brand. Especially during COVID times, with guests that complain and blame, the team answers with a smile, keeps everything clean and organized. Worth driving past other fitness options to workout at a place like this.

After upgrading to this location I hope to never go back to the other 24 hour fitness gyms! It is attached to the The Shoppes at Carlsbad (mall). The front desk staff always has a smile on his or her face and asks if they can help. Super nice and helpful. Especially Micheal, he has a great smile and customer service! I really appreciate the warm welcomes here from him and others too. My husband and I normally use the jacuzzi and shower. Huge plus there is lockers with complimentary codes you can enter for free for use. (If you don't have your own lock.) The people who come here are really nice too when we enter or exit the jacuzzi or someone is walking by, other members are kind to turn the knob to give jacuzzi more time since it is only in 15 minute intervals. Huge plus with getting super sport membership along with the lockers you get complimentary plastic bags for wet clothes if needed, and a machine to dry your swimsuit in a matter of seconds! Another huge positive is I never ran into any maintenance people! And I'm here normally in the late evening or graveyard times. There are friendly staff, friendly other fellow gym members, clean space and complimentary/convenient items for you! This is a great gym.< /Text>

I've been a member of the gym for 25 years and now I'm really disappointed of all the changes that they made.  Is not at 24-Hour fitness gym, it's only 20.  They closed it for 4 hours to clean, but nothing gets cleaned. There is mold in the bathrooms, chalk and water bottles through out the gym floor, dirty paper towels everywhere. The mirrors have never been cleaned, and management doesn't seem to care or do anything about it.  The gym is supposed to reopen at 4 a.m. when I like to go, but lately that has not been happening.  Sometimes they will reopen at 5 or later, whenever the lacs-a-dasicle decides to show up.  This used to be a really nice gym, but they really let it go downhill.<//Text>

Stopped by to try out local gyms since I just moved into the state. Lady at front desk said I'm not eligible for the 3 day guest pass since I have an out of state license. I let her know I won't be getting a state license since I'm in the military and we move around frequently. So she told me it'll be $25.00 for a day pass. I'll give my business somewhere else..<//text>

Went in to join, manager actually got mad at me because I wouldn't give them my phone number and email address (their terms and conditions say they can give your info to anybody they want). His reacting to my concerns about data privacy with anger and demanding personal and bank info for a silver sneakers membership is outrageous.<//text>

Tha absolute worst experience I've ever had dealing with sales people and management. I went in to join this gym because of location (5 min. from home) Shane greeted me and was initially very kind. I just wanted a membership but he up-sold me with group personal training. That was great at the time as I felt I needed a trainer. I explained to him that I had some concerns because I have MS and must to do many modifications with my workouts. Needless to say, he sold me a master trainer. I was never assessed. Shame on them! Actually, the next day I went in for training, NO trainer was there. Then I looked at the schedule and decided to give it another shot the next day, again, NO trainer present. I was so angry and wanted a refund and everything cancelled. Shane said I needed to talk with his manager but he wouldn't be in until Monday. I was so mad I drove all across town to the 24hr. fitness on Laurel Tree in Carlsbad because I know that's where the corporate office is. When I walked in I was greeted by Alicia who initially was very accommodating. She ended up up-selling me to a one one one master trainer which again I agreed to (she was trying to salvage the deal) I did have a session and was pleasantly surprised by this trainer. I scheduled another session for the next day. I showed up and both the trainer and Alicia greeted me. Said they had bad news, the trainer had to leave and could not do my session (apparently he had scheduled me but forgot that he had a class in San Diego for his masters program) who forgets that???? I had it at this point, I was absolutely done and incredibly turned off about everything with this gym. That was all a month ago and the personal training was cancelled and money was returned, however, I'm still a member and being charged and they have not cancelled my membership even though it was within the time period. So today I called to try to rectify this and was told by Alicia that she had spoke with her GM Fletcher and he was supposed to call me back. I do feel this was a made up story as she never said he was going to be the one to fix this, I've never heard from Fletcher and she said he will be in on Monday. I'm just getting the run around at this point and I'm super angry with all the fowl treatment I'm getting at this point. I just want all my money back and I feel they bank on the fact that people will just forget or most probably get annoyed just trying to deal with the whole circus. They are impossible to deal with and once they get your credit card they will just keep on charging. I'm going to report it to my credit card company so they can get my money back for me. This place is a joke!<//review>

The gym can be quite crowded even at non-peak hours. That said there is plenty of equipment. The outdoor area is great with lots of racks and bumper plates.

No towels is a bummer and the sinks have uncomfortably low water pressure.

Overall a good gym.<//Review>

<review>It Only Takes One Patient Person To Make Your Day SUPER. So Today Mr. Sebastian At The Front Desk Did That And Took About 5 MinutesTo Make My Day Much Brighter. It’s Not Always About Talking But Listening That Does It. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND HELPED ME WITH WHAT HE COULD AND LEFT THE CLUB MANAGER DETAILS TO FIX WHAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO. I PREDICT THIS PERSON WILL BE RECOGNIZED FOR A GREAT JOB DONE AND SOON HE LL BE MANAGER OF JUST THIS CLUB OR EVEN SEVERAL CLUBS. Being In Customer Service  For Over 30 Years I Can See And Love To Make Recognized To Corporate  Offices That They Should Be Very Proud Of Mr. Sebastian’s Skill Set And Use Him To Become Well Represented For 24 HOUR SUPER SPORT LOCATIONS. YOU PAY MORE FOR SUPER SPORT BUT ITS WELL WORTH IT. TRAIN HARD AND EXPERIENCE THE BEST LIKE MR. SEBASTIAN AND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. AT THIS OR ANY OTHER SUPER SPORT LOCATION. STARTED WITH REGULAR BUT THE UPGRADE OPENS SOME BEAUTIFUL DOORS..... GO SUPER SPORT YOU CANT GO WRONG😇🙏❤️❤️❤️ THANK GOD AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND PLEASE BE SAFE FOR THE 4 TH OF JULY AND ENJOY 😉< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The last time I was in a shower as moldy and grisly, it was in the third world.  I recommend 24 Hour Fitness take some of that cash they are saving on towel service and invest in some Tilex and a guy to mop the dirt off the locker room floor every 2 hours.

I signed up for a 3 day trial online and once I arrived at the facility they didn’t honor because I didn’t have a local ID and didn’t honor a military ID. Seeing how there’s a major base 5 miles away, I didn’t see the issue. On top of that they offered one day at 25$ without even showing me the facility. Like what< /Review>

<Text>I like this gym except that the showers are really gross every time I visit - last week there was a spider in my shower and the drain was clogged, so I ended up showering in inches of filthy water. There are also rust stains on the walls of every shower - and it is a new facility! BLEACH and routine cleaning are desperately needed. Also, no one ever wipes down the equipment as far as I can tell, so hygiene is a major challenge at this site. MAJOR. I asked other guests about it and I heard "OH, I would never shower here" often. Also, the volume on many of the machines does not work - cannot be heard well, and finally, MORE TVs with cable news, movies, etc. You don't need to advertise to people  - the 24 hour channel  - when they are already in the building.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x14e38239821de06f:0xb928c3ef28488d4c</GmapID></record>

I love this gym, but many times the bathroom just doesn’t have toilet paper!! I tell them when I arrive after using the bathroom and they always promise to put some in there, but when I leave 1 1/2 - 2 hours later, the toilet paper is still not replaced! This has happened multiple times. It’d be a different story if they hadn’t promised to replace it. It’s just super annoying to sit down & realize you had to use a toilet seat cover that crumbles & falls apart when it gets wet! Ugh!!< /Text>

I really do l love this gym and everything it has to offer, however I tried to bring a guest one time and my guest was very rudely told NO, because she once had a membership 10 years ago. We tried to explain to the girl working at the front that she was interested in checking out this NEW gym and switching back over from planet fitness, but they literally wouldn't even let us have a guest pass because she was a member 10 years ago. Ridiculous that for what I pay each month, I can't even bring a guest.</Text>

This used to be one of my favorite 24 locations, but lately all of the stair masters are always broken. Be cautious because they aren’t always labeled as broken. All they do is “fix” it and take the sign off and it’ll be broken again within the week.</review>

Quite disappointingi when you wake up early for a cycle class on the schedule and the instructor doesn't bother to show up? Asked the person at the front desk and they had no idea what happened or why? Has happened to me twice in the last two weeks, once at Oceanside sport and 2nd time this morning at Carlsbad super sport? I would rather have slept in! Or gone to work early and worked out later. Tough when you have a tightly scheduled day!</review>

The availability of child care is the most important thing to me because I otherwise will not be able to use the facility. I have had to wait 45 minutes or longer on several occasions because the Kid's Club was not appropriately staffed. The hours of the Kid's Club was also recently reduced which has been inconvenient as we like to go as a family around 4pm and the Club doesn't open until 5pm which doesn't allow enough time to work out and get the children home in time for dinner and bed time.<//review>

If you have children and are looking for a gym.... DON’T JOIN THIS GYM! I have only been a member for two weeks and have had to wait to put my kids in their childcare EVERY SINGLE TIME sometime for over an hour... up to TWO hours! It doesn’t matter if you come before the child care center opens.... other parents are there already waiting. They are ALWAYS understaffed in the childcare room. There are plenty of other staff members standing around but none to help in the kids room. It’s awful. We pay twice as much as LA Fitness charges... and half the time you won’t get to workout. I am going to leave this gym and go back LA Fitness—I NEVER had to wait there.</Text>

<Text>12/2018 Update: The towel service is being discontinued this month. The posted notice regarding ecological reasons is false, as it will have the reverse effect. It is also a degradation of services provided with no cost compensation offered. Reduced rating by the one star gained when they finally the broken shower heads after two years.

Picture is from the recent 2018 heat wave where they propped open the door with the air conditioning on, which made the only comfortable place in the facility the check in desk. This continued all summer.

They have recently repaired the showers in the men's locker room, where previously only one had fully functioning shower head now at least 4 do. This moved my review from 1 to 3 stars. If it were a sliding scale, it would be 4 stars :)

Equipment is nicely varied, though minimally maintained. Many creak for loose fittings a no oil for at least a year.</Text>< rate>

<review>I'm really dissatisfied with this gym. The front staff knows absolutely nothing and the management is no help. All I wanted to find out was the time of a yoga class event and was basically dismissed by the manager. He didn't even try to find out for me but rather said he didn't know and walked away. Most of the machines are broken, the spa is always disgusting and for the money you pay to go to this "super sport" it isn't worth it. I'm over you 24 hour. Been a customer for over 15 years but I'm getting really sick and tired of the way this gym is run.

<Text>Good equipment and clean showers    thats where the positives end.  Appalling customer service and when i voiced a concern / complaint was told   we have 10,000 members so we must be doing something right !
The so called manager of the place is arrogant and self important ,    like to watch TV when i work out but they never allow to switch channels, to watch soccer for example   even if the place is empty    the answer is always   the manager has the controls and he is not in .... but even if he is in he will not change as he can sit back in his seat from the office and watch what he wants to watch    yes seriously        great overall gym but the customer service is so bad ...... cancelled membership< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Sales guy, Edward Myers, just happened to forget to make clear that even though im paying $49.99 today as an Inital Fee... the ANNUAL fee of the SAME AMOUNT will be charged 3 months after you open the account... so not only is it an Extra $49.99 Today ON TOP of the 1st and last months rent, its an Extra $49.99 in 3 months...

I was under the impression that the 49.99 I was paying today was that Fee. Nope.

Oh... and that is 100% non refundable per the contract you sign ELECTRONICALLY.
(Called corporate and they refused [per signed contract] to even think of making an exception)

0/10 - Will never use 24 fitness again. I feel manipulated and not valued as a customer.< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Do not ever fall for this scam! It is shame this 24HF is sponsoring US Olympic teams, while scamming club members! I have paid over $3000 for personal training sessions in Sep 2017 and Jan 2018, but due to my move out of the state, I have requested refund for unused sessions in March which I have yet to recieve and it has been going on 6 months now. After they ignored my request for months, I finally claimed a dispute thru my bank in May. Then the General Manager Dennis Fletcher denied the refund. My bank reopened the case and then he told me and my bank he would refund $953 dollar credit back on to my account and that was June. Of course he lied. I never recieved it back. I sent two more follow up emails to him for the refund status and he ignored my email. I am so speechless with the way they do business. I'm contacting my bank again to get this taken care of. They want your business but once they take your money, they turn into a thief!! Do not fall for the scam!!! I WILL MAKE sure to warn on Yelp and also send a copy of my email to the 24HF Corp. It is really shame that 24HF Corp hired a GM who is not only such a liar but also very incompetent and unprofessional!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

This long review can save you money.

I joined the club in August and planned on only using the club late at night due due to the up to date floor plan being too small for the large amount of members.

1.) After signing up online I was told I get an employer discount on the joining fee which I had paid and that the difference would be applied as a credit. I recently found out that that is not possible, but no one ever notified me that they would be going back on word so I was expecting the credits.

2.) I was not billed for 2 months and my annual fee was not charged to my card on file. I had enough money in the account and my card never had a hold on it. I called or spoke with someone in person regarding not being charged and they confirmed each time that my account was in good standing. On November 10th I spoke with somebody who said that due to my discount I would not be billed until January for anything what so ever. So I spent the money I set aside for they gym on my upcoming wedding since I was told and confirmed that I did not owe anything and would not have to pay until January.

3.) On the 19th I was billed 120 dollars and was told that I also owed $50.00 dollars. I was okay paying the money, but I can't afford it all at once and I can't afford the membership going forward due to their negligence. The manager did waive the $50.00 but that still does not help me after unexpectedly having my account withdrawn.

4.) I was told and confirmed with the manager that only corporate can let me out of my contract. When I called the corporate number they confirmed that they would not be able to do that and only the manager can do so and that she may not have done this so she doesn't look bad for her bosses.

While I do not think most of the lies were malicious or deliberate they did make several mistakes and unintentionally lie. They refused to correct those mistakes or work with me what so ever. As someone who works for a fitness facility with over 18,000 members I would never allow so many of my staff to be this poorly trained and would correct any mistakes made swiftly.<//Text>

< Review>
Came here as a guest and was basically told to sit down and shut up until they were ready to sell me on membership. After 20 minutes of waiting (and on a timeline due to a class I wanted to go to, and travelled over 30m to come to this specific location) asked if I could meet with the rep after the class and was told no. Needless to say we weren't happy about the lack of customer service or consideration. See ya 24-fitness! We went across the street and found a much friendlier place to take our business to.<//Review>

Idk why but I feel like this 24 Hour Fitness feels like home to me. The staff are always smiling, they make me feel welcomed, they always lend a helping hand, recommended good protein if you ask (and they won't go for the most expensive ones right off the back like some places), and the staff is always there to answer your questions and needs. Alyssa Goold (I remember her name because of her card she gave me) helped me and helped me with a military discount that they forgot to give me last time. She was very helpful and as we're all my questions. Richard and Martin were very professional and motivational!! Richard helped me with setting goals, finding my weaknesses, and giving me advice on how to tackle those weaknesses and turn them into strengths. Martin Helped me with putting my goals into motion when I participated in one of his classes. He was very professional and I can tell he liked his job because he memorized everyone's name. This 24 Hour Fitness is one of the best by far.<//Review>

I like this 24 hour Fitness location, however this place never gets the ladies showers clean, I been coming here for the last two months and not once they have clean the ladies showers, doors are all nasty and stain, floors and walls never cleaned in the stalls. It is sad, it keeps getting worst and worst.< /Review>

Ok this place has received some bad reviews. But let's cover a couple things.

First to the guy who suddenly couldn't afford payments because they didn't take the money for 2 months then even waived $50 for you. You lack knowledge in the finances brotha man. When a company is owed but doesn't take it for some reason, you don't spend it. Cmon man.

Customer service? This is a gym. Come in and get yourself in shape. You want your hand held? There are expensive gyms that can do that to you.

I've been going to gyms for the majority of my life. Nothing matters at a gym but this. Can I get in the best shape of my life here? The answer here is yes, yes I can. So go do it. Or don't. Up to you.<//text>

<text>They wouldn’t honor a 3 day pass which they advertised because I didn’t live in the local area and had been to a 25 hour fitness location before. Then tried to get me to either buy a day pass for $25 or sign up for a membership. No thank you, I will never go to a 24 hour fitness again.<//text>< GmapID>

We got some rhubarb pastry, a chocolate almond croissant, and some focaccia (pizza?) with Bulgarian feta that was very tasty.</text>< pics>

The best in town or maybe just how I like em. Nice bit of crunch on the outside, not too sweet, and interesting flour/flavor combos. Happy to see pizza slices are also back in action.</review>< Pictures>

Best Pizza in Berkeley as far as I'm concerned. Piping hot or half baked, it's great stuff. Quick and easy to pick up after school, for an easy dinner. Also amazing pastries.< /text>

<name>Benito Delgado-Olson<//name><review>This bakery and their staff are a local treasure and have been one of the few tastes of normalcy during the Pandemic. Their pizza is delicious, breads are fresh and the pastries are second to none - everything is from scratch. We love the macaroons, while my niece and nephews love their other cookies. Their coffee and iced coffee is also strong and ideal for coffee lovers and you can buy their coffee beans.</review>< Pictures>

Kind people, wonderfully tasty pizzas. The price is right. It sometimes feels like a variable & long wait, but I take it as their secret ingredient so you'll enjoy it that much more<//review>

If you like ginger cookies,  one of the best.  And those chocolate things?  Yum.  We'd share pics but everything is always gone before we remember to take.< /review>< pics>

This place is a local treasure. Everything here seems to be made by experts and assembled with love. Time your visit when they have Pizza by the slice for an extra special treat. The chocolate cookies with chocolate chips are fantastic; perfect.</text>

<review>Fantastic pizza. They have a different kind each day, so there is only one choice, but it's really good! Closed Monday and tuesday. Pizza is served 11:30-2 and 4:30-7. Get it while the getting is good.< /review>< Rate>

Lovely neighborhood space with good coffee.  The morning pastries are mostly good, but occasionally the savory pastries can be greasy, heavy, or poorly seasoned.  Morning buns, cinnamon twists, cream cheese pastries, and cookies are consistently good. Each pastry is about $5.  One thing I like is the variety of options - this is not your typical chain coffee store pastry selection.  The staff is really nice and helpful.  The pizzas are very good - different toppings daily. $3 slice, $24 whole. Closed Mondays and Tuesdays.</Review>

I think between the hours of 11 and 2 they serve pizza and each slice is $3.75. they also have this awesome station with some sort of herb infused chili oil that tastes very good with pizza. I also love the environment there this is a bakery so you can also buy a big Goods there there's a piano I think they let you play with. They have a couple of sitting outside so if you have a dog you can buy what you want and eat it outside. It's located next to the fire station and right across the street from 7-Eleven.</review>< pictures>

<review>I grew up eating Nabolom baked goods with Julia, then raising my daughter on them as she grew up.  I was so happy when Julia re-opened it.  I LOVE the Jalapeno Cheese scones and the Nabolom standard cheese rolls.  My now 4.5 year olds love the pizza!  Highly recommend!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

They have very good pizza, you order how much pizza you want and they always have a good pizza of the day. That being said their selection of baked goods is somewhat lack luster and never looks that good. Its a good place to stop by if you want pizza, but if you're looking for a bakery with a good selection, I'd recommend looking elsewhere</review>

The pizza is great. It's not a red sauce base, but it's flavorful & delicious. Go for the pizza & if they have a prune danish, buy it. Otherwise, I would skip most of the baked goods.< /Review>

<review>Nabolom Bakery has the best Pizza in the Elmwood! A lot of the cheeses in the Pizza menu have sharp flavors that include; feta, pecorino, and many more. What makes the Bakery in whole so delicious is the simplicity in the flavors that pack a punch in taste. Their scones are effervescent with the right amount of baking soda, and their selection of beers are a perfect match for the main attraction; did I say amazing Pizza! Lastly, the team of Baker's and assistants really make this a feel good, friendly, local spot; and there are outside tables, for you to enjoy your baked goods.<//review>< Pics>

Less than a month opened and Nabolom is back better than ever.  Fantastic pastries, great coffee, and their pizza is incredible...in fact it's from the same "family tree" as Cheeseboard.  So, so glad to have this community gem back under local ownership.  Check it out, you won't be sorry.<//review>

Great coffee and pastry made on premise. Resident band playing every Saturday morning. Somewhat ridiculously hard to remember the hours they keep. Often we would come and completely miss their 2pm deadline for ordering pizza.<//text>

This co-op bakery will knock your socks off with their selection and quality of baked-goods. Lots of vegan options to choose from as well. I'd recommend looking at the 1/2 off day old section before dropping some cash on the fresh stuff.<//Text>

<rate>2</rate><text>The treats may be be good but the hours of operation for pizza is rediculous. How is someone supposed to remember, 1230-2pm, then closed, then open 430pm-7pm.  And no Monday-Tuesday. If the hrs were easier to remember, maybe more folks would visit. I love to support local businesses, but every time I go to N, it doesn't have what I need.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>2 stars for being friendly but this place is such a let down from the old Nabolom.  Apparently it's a pizza "cheese board" bandwagon place now because the pastry selection is nowhere near what it used to be.  There is now only one vegan item and it's fat/sugar free (maybe gluten free, too?). Ugh.</text><gmapID>0x80857dcd98ee53a3:0x288d6d0cd58f87c7</gmapID>< Name>

<review>This is my fav coffee shop in the Bay Area.  It's not slick, clever, or anything but down-to-earth and real - the fruit of which makes for an overall atmosphere of comfort and clarity.  The coffee is excellent, the baked goods also excellent (I like the sandwiches); the workers are quick to interact in an authentic way, and it's easy to be there.  Different than almost anywhere else in all the best ways.< /review><rate>5</rate><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pics>

New ownership. Not worker-owned anymore. Pizza just OK. Trying to be like cheeseboard with slice a day. Not very welcoming atmosphere either! Walls all whitewashed. Very different than old nabolom.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Exceptional value for really good tasty Mexican. The vegetable burrito was more than I could eat but they offered to box the rest. Salsa had a bit of a bite and the chips were tastier than usual. A small selection of domestic and imported beer and a larger on draft that went well with the meal.
Couldn't fault the place really.<//review>< Pics>

The food always tastes fresh and is served quickly. They use quality ingredients and you can tell. They have a great menu and offer a variety of drinks. There are a few tables out on the courtyard of a small neighborhood strip mall. The traffic - both cars and pedestrians- is not to busy. It is always an enjoyable experience!< /Review>< username>

OK, here is a good surprise! I rate La Hacienda 5 of 5 stars. Sometimes the best Mexican restaurants are the little hole-in-the-wall locations. La Hacienda is relatively small with a few patio tables. The shining star is the food and salsa. Perhaps the simplest Mexican menu that I've seen with a hand-full of choices, but, easy to find several favorite choices in the set. The chips and salsa are really enjoyable. The food is outstanding! Yes, I was surprised. It was really good. It took a Groupon to get me to notice this place, but, I assure you that I'll be returning.<//review>

<review>La Hacienda is a nice, quaint place. The quality of the food is always consistent.  I love how each meal begins with the small cup of albondigas soup. It is tasty. The Chile rellenos delivered a satisfying blend of Chile, sauce, and cheese. The meat of the chicken enchilada was a tad dry, yet flavorful. This is a nice place that will certainly please.</review><Response>None</Response><user_id>114523756661530881770</user_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< time>

I've been going to this restaurant since I was a kid! The family that owns it is the best. The food is authentic and delicious. My favorite is the enchiladas suizas (sp?) and the vegetarian burrito! Can't go wrong with either.< /Review>

OK, here is a good surprise! I rate La Hacienda 5 of 5 stars. Sometimes the best Mexican restaurants are the little hole-in-the-wall locations. La Hacienda is relatively small with a few patio tables. The shining star is the food and salsa. Perhaps the simplest Mexican menu that I've seen with a hand-full of choices, but, easy to find several favorite choices in the set. The chips and salsa are really enjoyable. The food is outstanding! Yes, I was surprised. It was really good. It took a Groupon to get me to notice this place, but, I assure you that I'll be returning.<//review>

Best Mexican food in San Carlos. Better and less expensive than Lulu's. Family run, all homemade and fresh daily. Chimichangas are my favorite.<//review>

I got my tattoo from F. Fabian. My wife introduced me to him cause she liked his colors. I loved giving him my idea and having him listen to me when we met in person. I felt he cared about the piece and making sure I was happy. In the pictures you can see how his art evolved with my input and desires. I’m in love with the final product, thank you!</Text>

I was tattooed by Nayelli and i had an awesome experience!!! They were very knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable while I was getting my tattoo. The tattoo came out better than I could have imagined and I can't wait to show it off!! 11/10 would recommend and would come again! ❤️</Review>

Had my tattoo done by Filip yesterday and I couldn’t be happier! He really took the time to make sure everything was absolutely perfect, and that I was comfortable the entire time. His artistry is unmatched!</review>

< Review>
I came here for the first time about six months ago to support a friend who got her tattoo from Maggie. The staff was nice and her design came out nice. Going along with her made me think more seriously about getting my first tattoo. I booked an appointment with Sid and he was fantastic. He walked me through the whole process and made me feel very comfortable throughout the whole sitting. At some points it was almost relaxing with the classical music in the background. I am a very anxious person so I'm very glad that I tagged along with my friend last year and was exposed to Black and Blue! I'm very happy with my new ink.<//Review>

Michael was phenomenal!! By far one of the best tattoo experiences I’ve had so far. He was so nice, payed attention to every little detail, and made sure I got exactly what I wanted. He also had such a light touch. I walked out so happy and I highly recommend them.<//Review>

<text>I have to commute from Santa Clara to San Francisco and to me it's worth the drive. I'm so happy with my results. It took me a long time to find an artist that could fulfill my tattoo expectations. I would highly recommend Luke for all your traditional Japanese tattoos.< /text><Rating>4< /Rating><Name>Rose Simmons</Name></record>

<Review>Today I got my second tattoo from Sid, and boy is it GORGEOUS! He did a large portrait of my cat on my inner right forearm, and I couldn’t be happier with it. He’s an extremely talented artist, and a consummate professional. Sid’s artistry is extraordinary, and he has and impressive eye for detail. My wife and I had previously gone to him for large botanical tattoos to commemorate our wedding, and he brought both of our visions to life beautifully. If you’re looking for a tattoo artist with a heart of gold and a singular talent for nature-inspired tattoos, Sid is your man. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I had my first tattoo done by Filip back in November 2019 when I was visiting San Francisco. His line work is very impressive. I had another tattoo artist back in my home state tell me how amazing the line work was.  The other artists there are amazing as well. Wonderful vibe and great artists. HIGHLY recommend if you're looking for great work.<//review>< user>

Super amazing shop with great trust worthy talented artists. No one takes work that they don’t think they can do an 110% amazing job at and everyone treats each other and clients with the most respect. Gentle hands and great bedside manners help guide clients through the tattoo as comfortable as possible. Heaters, blankets, fans, comfortable seating, water and snacks all provided for clients comfort and creates a luxurious experience.
Can’t say enough great things about the shop!<//Review>

Sid is cool and does amazing work. All the artists here do amazing work. Clean shop with good tables. He was respectful and I absolutely can't wait to get me next tattoo. Shows you your new needles so you know they are unused. Look for the artists on Instagram to see their work.<//Review>

I had an awesome experience with Jackie!!. She was so incredibly engaging, personable, and excited about working together. I chose one of her rad sketches for a Friday the 13th flash sale and it came out better than I could have imagined!!!!  Her work is so unique and she puts in the time to make it something you’ll be so excited to show off. I can’t wait to keep coming back for more with her!

My partner was tattooed by Androidoh and it turned out awesome! He has such a unique and bold style, exactly what my partner looks for in an artist. He was really happy to create something according to my partner’s taste, while also making it his own creation.

We had such an awesome time here! The shop is incredibly clean and everyone is respectful of each other’s work. Cool people and great location. Such a good vibe here- highly recommend!!!</text>< pictures>

She was really responsive in communication and she took the time to ask questions and really understand what elements I was hoping for in the design during the consultation process. The final draft was everything I hoped for and more!

For the actual tattooing, she was kind, patient, and fun over the three hour period, making it easy and a pleasure to sit (lie down?) that long through the pain. And, of course, the work is amazing! She is one of the best in the business and there are few, if any, that can work the magic she does (though it's all from hard work really, she just makes it seem like magic). All in all, it was an amazing experience and I highly recommend her if you're cool people and can somehow get on her books.

<Text>Love the atmosphere! All artists have outstanding portfolios, I had my piece touched up by Mariel. She’s very talented and I would highly recommend her! Staff are friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Women owned and queer friendly is a plus! Will definitely be going here again for future tattoos.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I had a fantastic experience at Black & Blue Tattoo. I've had a fairly skeletal idea in my head for quite some time and Idexa worked with me collaboratively to create a piece that was exactly what I wanted. An extremely welcoming environment makes for a comfortable experience with limitless free expression. Top tier talent, low ego, open environment and absolute professionalism. I highly recommend Black & Blue Tattoo.</Text>< pics>

Mariels work speaks for itself, and she also has excellent communication and was easily the most professional artist that I've met- and I've been tattooed by 6 other people! I'm sooo happy and can't wait for another session! I've been to 4 other good studios (in different places), and I'd recommend B&B over any of them.</text>

Got a super cute tattoo from WHO and I love it. Their tattoos are a lil pricy, definitely gotta plan ahead for it, but they get in a really good quality tattoo quick. Very clean, very thorough throughout, all the employees were super nice and helpful. WHO’s work is incredibly vibrant and colorful, but they also do a fantastic job with line work and lettering. I wouldn’t have ended our visit to SF any other way- with a souvenir I get to see everywhere I go everyday! If you have the time and money, hit them up for sure!</text>

I had the honor of being inked by Claire the other day. Could not be more happy/proud to wear her work.
Claire has a very light touch and is very talented. She also is very knowledge in her craft. Claire is a very good listener and can make magic happen with her art.
The shop is very clean and well organized. The staff was very friendly and professional.
Thanks again for a fantastic experience.< /Review>

Idexa was 100! She listened, was patient, and pushed me to finish up my vision (despite a little discomfort...but it is a tattoo, after all!). What I got in the end was exactly what I had envisioned. Simple, linear geometry up my arm, across my shoulder, and down my back. Perfect lines. She doesn't set false expectations, takes her time, and ensured that I was more than comfortable and happy throughout the appointment. I am looking forward to future pieces with her! Would highly recommend.</text>

This tattoo place is absolutely phenomenal. It’s super clean and professional and our tattoo artist was impeccable. I came in for only two small ones on my wrists and ended up with two more big ones on my chest and arm. I would send anyone here that is interested in tattoos! This place rocks! We also chose this place because of the quality of inks and toxin free ink. Michael Dematty is seriously a genius and his work is excellent!!</review>

<text>I cannot express how happy I am with the tattoo I received from Idexa at her shop Black & Blue. She was so great to work with. I came in with a concept of what I wanted and Idexa made it a reality. The process was very collaborative and I really enjoyed getting to know her. Idexa's style is bold and abstract but many independent contractors work at her shop so if that is not your style, there is plenty of variety to choose from. Everyone I interacted with in the shop was incredibly kind and professional. They take their job very seriously and are clean, careful and courteous. Would highly recommended this shop.<//text>< Pictures>

I saw Brucius here, after admiring his work for years. He was well worth the wait. We spent at least a couple hours just sitting together, working on the design of the tattoo. When the time came, he was meticulous and precise, but with awesome bedside manner. I don't have the greatest pain tolerance, but he coached me through it and I adore my new tattoo. The whole Black and Blue staff were friend, courteous, and professional! Definitely will come back here for more work.</text>

Tattoos here are in a class of their own. Brucius did my tattoo, and let me tell you, it's worth the six months to a year of waiting to have it done the right way. The styles and quality of work here is unmatched.<//review>

I told Michael the concept I wanted to commemorate the birth of my first grandchild. I left it to his talent for the execution of the piece, as far as the lay out. He nailed it perfectly. I am more than pleased & satisfied w/this excellent result. The shop itself is clean & staff are friendly, & helpful.

<review>Vinh was incredible. I would recommend him to anyone - keen attention to detail, had a light hand, and worked super quickly. Vinh also communicated with me via email so after the initial consultation I was able to continue to tweak and evolve the sketch until the day I actually got tattooed. He was incredibly accommodating and responsive.< /review>< Pictures>

I had an incredible tattoo experience with Idexa. This was my first tattoo and I spent many months sketching and trying to find the right person. I was drawn to Idexa's style, and appreciated how she avoided the obvious tropes and brought creativity and a unique perspective/hand to all of her artwork. Her vision, artistic balance and precision, and flexibility to adapt, allowed for a beautiful end result. The experience itself was actually meditative and invigorating. Her supportive approach, the collaborative process she creates, and her intuitive, calming vibe enabled a truly gratifying experience. I LOVE my tattoo (more each day :) and feel incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to dive into the tattoo world with Idexa.</Review>

She was very nice and friendly with an amazing style. It's feminine but strong with very nice linework. She also seemed to be a very gentle artist, she worked well with the skin as well as the canvas herself.  Also provides numbing if you need it. I think they do it pre-emptively anyways.< /text>< pics>

<text>My relationship with this establishment and all of the artists has always been pleasant. And over time (2.5 years now) I've become family. While Courtney O'Shea is my primary artist; I also have had Michael DeMatty work on me and have always been completely satisfied with the results. I have always been treated with respect and made to feel important as a guest and client. Every piece of work I've observed has been nothing but well executed. I recommend Black & Blue regularly. It is the first shop I walked into where I didn't feel pressured and/or was talked down to. I've never considered another establishment..and unless Courtney leaves them...never will.</text>< Rate>

I came all the way from Wisconsin with my boyfriend. Let me tell you, I would fly all the way back to get another and I don't think I will ever go to anyone else. He is so friendly and he would never settle for less than perfection for you or anyone else. He is gentle, clean, extremely knowledgeable and so so talented. My boyfriend is coming back to San Fran with me to get one from him as well. You know when you step into his office that you've made a great choice and a good friend who will really be there to answer any questions you might have.
I was scared for my first tattoo, truth be told i was shaking like a leaf (although I tried to hide it) Brucius gave me a cup of water and he walked me through everything. When he started I was still nervous but he kept talking to me and kept my mind off the needle. It ended up such a fantastic experience. I was really at ease and so happy with the outcome. Even after a year it still looks great. I'll still be coming back for a touch up and definitely another one. Great shop, but an even greater Brucius</review><Response>{'time': 1470987593309, 'text': 'Thank you kindly!

Idexa did a tremendous job on a rather onerous mathematical tattoo of mine.  I'm thoroughly impressed.<//review>

Brucius was amazing! I waited 5 months to get a small piece on my bicep of the Farallon Islands and the wait was worth it. We worked together for several hours to create the design that was personally meaningful and beautiful and Brucius was extremely attentive to the details that were important to me. I chose him to do this piece specifically because of his mastery of fine detail and natural realism. I had so much fun with Brucius - he was warm, welcoming, funny, and endlessly curious about the natural world. Our conversations that made the time fly by and the actual tattooing process was so much more comfortable than I expected. The shop and artists' workspace are beautiful and everyone at Black & Blue was so nice. From the moment I called the shop to schedule a consultation I was struck by how welcoming and unassuming they were for a shop with world-class artists. Thank you Brucius and Black & Blue!</review><name>Jane Khudyakov< /name><userid>103788467904285224369</userid>< GmapID>

{'time': 1618461788890, 'text': 'Sorry, you are outraged by our prices. $100 is actually very low for a SF shop to charge for a few words. You must have had a newer artist, because tattoo artists with 5 plus years of experience would have charges you much more. We are actually a high end and quality shop and tattoos are permanent. Hope, you still like what you got! xxx'}< /resp>

I am very disappointed of this place. Use to be good before Covid hit, now their food doesn’t even have flavor. Order beef broccoli, but they give us chicken broccoli. There is sauce enough on any their entrees. The quality of food just went down hill. It’s very sad, because I did really like this place.< /Review>

I been have been going here for years. Never have I had a issue with my order. Yesterday for the first time I brought my food home and no sauce. But not only did they make it right, I have never had my food taste this good. I love this place!<//review>

Definitely my go-to Chinese spot. Also, they are very clean and are taking a lot of safety and sanitary precautions with Covid which makes me feel really safe and confident in going there.< /Text>< Pics>

They are making the whole experience very Covid-19 safe (masks required, ordering before, waiting outside). Huge portions even though you can't fill your own Mongolian bowl. Always super friendly.</text>

Just not good to me... I've eaten here a few times in my life and it's the same to me everytime it just isn't that good to me... the kung pao chicken and coconut shrimp were just okay to me actually the kung pao chicken was actually really watery and was not at all hot the way it's supposed to be.. coconut shrimp was drowned in the sweet white sauce... I won't go back that was the straw to break that camel's back... oh and the noodles look like white thick worms... Panda Express has WAY better noodles then this place no disrespect.< /Text>

Use to be my go to spot but now they've increased the Mongolian prices, which use to be for all you can eat. Now you are paying more for one bowl only, set portions (you cant over load the bowl) and no soup. Sigh...< /Review>

<Review>I love Mongolian bbq and they do the best! You have to fill out a paper if you walk in with what you want, you just go thru and circle what you want as far as type of meat, veggies and how any scoops of the different types of sauces. If you are not sure let them know you want flavor and or if you want it spicy and they are more than happy to help you fill it out. They will hook you up and it is the bomb. The Mongolian bbq is $10.77 out the door, it comes with your choice of chicken fried rice or white rice and a veggie egg roll. Mask is required to enter and they do have plastic up around. They do ask if your ordering any thing else besides Mongolian bbq call the order on ahead of time and pick it up (signs posted). The portions are large and me and my husbands can share and get full!< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Mongolian BBQ food was excellent, place meh not so much. I didn't order anything from the menu for Chinese food. Restrooms and place need update from inside.<//text>

I had ordered a dinner for my family at 7pm well before closing. They cancelled my order after telling me 3 different times that it was on the way. I waited 1.5 hours for dinner that was never going to be delivered. Thanks guys! Superior service!</Text>

Alot to say. This place is very good. 10 out of 10 would recommend to come more than once. One bowl normally fills me up but it's to good to stop. The food quality is outstanding. The staff are attentive and very pleasant. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the restrooms. Little on the outdated and unclean side but everything else. Is absolutely the best.<//Review>

The Mongolian food is not as good as it looks. There’s no flavor in the food at all. The seafood soup tasted horrible and has imitation crab meat. Wouldn’t recommend this so someone I hate, this place is horrible. If you had a bad experience here as well or are reading this before you come PLEASE try Wong’s Canton on watt ave. Superior service and food at WONGS CANTON...</Text>

They offer Chinese food and an all you can eat Mongolian BBQ. We always get the Mongolian BBQ and love it.  It's made fresh and you select how much meat, noodles and or vegetables you want so you can make this as a very healthy meal. You also select the sauce you want to flavor you meal, giving you an endless combination of flavors and types of meals. They have chicken beef and lamb meats to choose from.< /review>< pics>

<Review>The silver Gardens did it great place if you'd like on Golden or Asian food. They have been there since about 2001 2002 and I have eaten there since that time. The management our staff are all more than polite when you go in there. I go by and get a fried rice or any of the other week. Great place give it a try<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< username>

Love this place.  The Mongolian is amazing. The servers are friendly and helpful as well as fun.  I've been here more times than I can count for the Mongolian, but haven't tried the actual Chinese menu yet.  I have no doubt that it will be great and change this to 5 stars!!</text>

<review>This is a great place to take the family. Great value (can't be beat)! The food is always fresh and comes out super hot. We've been going there for over 10 years and love both the Chinese food as well as the Mongolian BBQ. Always fast and friendly service! Must try it for yourself. It could use an update in decor ;)< /review>< Date>

<review>I have been searching for a good Chinese food restaurant. There are many that are okay but so exspensive for just okay food. This place was delicious! We ordered a family meal that was for 2 people but wow so much food! Plenty for left overs! It came with egg rolls and fried rice, cheese wontons, and foli wrapped chicken. The entrees were mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken. It even came with hot and sour soup which is a personal fav of mine and i usually dont get since entrees and side are always so expensive. I would definately recommend this place and will be ordering again soon!< /review>< date>

<Review>Kind of a hole in the wall place that could work on their interior decor. Their food though... It's fantastic! Everything is always fresh and cooked wonderfully. The servings are huge as well. I consider myself a pretty big eater and I have only left here once without left overs after ordering the dinner special. The servers are wonderful as well. Plus, they have Mongolian barbecue buffet for dinner if you're not in the mood for standard Chinese. This is one of my top Chinese food choices for sure.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809ad9282e99a27f:0xf3168a13fc67cba1<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is a laid back restaurant, and serves the only Chinese/Mongolian food we eat here in Sac. We order dinner special #C and are never disappointed.

The people are very friendly and personable. We like to be silly when we go out and the staff here join in and laugh at our lame humor... Makes the outting more fun to share a smile and giggle.

Anyways, we haven't used the wok option to eat, but there is always someone in line to get it.
Perhaps next time we will branch out for something new.
But until then, give this place a try and enjoy.<//Text>

<review>I've been going here for nearly 20 years since I was in high school. Anytime I'm back in town I go here. Great selections, great tasting sauces just don't be afraid to put quite a few scoops of the sauces to get bold flavor. Same cooks since forever,  great work guys! The only place that I know who let's you take your left overs, even during the dinner all you can eat!<//review>< user>

Kind of a hole in the wall place that could work on their interior decor. Their food though... It's fantastic! Everything is always fresh and cooked wonderfully. The servings are huge as well. I consider myself a pretty big eater and I have only left here once without left overs after ordering the dinner special. The servers are wonderful as well. Plus, they have Mongolian barbecue buffet for dinner if you're not in the mood for standard Chinese. This is one of my top Chinese food choices for sure.< /Review>

This place hands down was some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The customer service was amazing, they made us feel like regulars. They were extremely quick and brought out SO much food for only 30 bucks I was shocked! Their drink menu is dirt cheap too. This is one place I would not judge by its cover. At first I thought it might be awful because of its location but nope, I was wrong. Best place in town. Definitely going back for seconds.</Review>

Love the Chow Mein here. Also I like the fact that if you choose Mongolian Style they will prepare your food in front of you. You also have the option of menu, which you can either dine in or take it to go. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the inside of the restaurant isn't very  appealing. Everything is pretty old and worn out and the ceiling has huge brown water stains and it doesn't look good especially if you are dining in the restaurant. Other than that, they offer lots of great meat and seafood options, the portions are large and the price is worth it and the food is amazing< /review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>I started eating here when this place first opened. The restaurant was clean, the food was good, and the staff was friendly. Most of that hasn't changed.

I visit for the first time in years and am taken aback by how things have deteriorated. Outside the restaurant was swarming with transients, some waiting outside the door to hit people up for money. I'm all for helping people but let the business do business! Inside looked run down.  It looked like they hadn't changed anything from 15 years ago when they opened. Literally nothing.

It took an exceedingly long time to get our drinks and appetizers. When we did, all of our drinks were noticeably and insultingly watered down.

On the positive, the food was still good in spite of the lack of ambiance. The person who helped us was polite and accommodating. Cant beat the cream cheese wontons. I just hope they clean up some issues.< /Review><Rate>3<//Rate><Resp>None< /Resp><user_id>104755843662789879498<//user_id>< date>

<Review>Great place, large portions, and good american Chinese food. Would have given another star if the two times i went for mongolian bbq didn't finish after my friends plates came from the kitchen.  Other times i had to wait for the chef to come out for the bbq, and both times my friends meals are done by the time he starts cooking. Not sure what to think of it.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x809ad9282e99a27f:0xf3168a13fc67cba1</gmap_id></record>

<text>We've been going to Silver Garden for over 10 years - they have the best fried rice I've ever had.  The people are very friendly,  the prices are good,  and the food is fabulous.   The only place we ever go for Chinese food  - wouldn't want to go anywhere else!<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Great place, large portions, and good american Chinese food. Would have given another star if the two times i went for mongolian bbq didn't finish after my friends plates came from the kitchen.  Other times i had to wait for the chef to come out for the bbq, and both times my friends meals are done by the time he starts cooking. Not sure what to think of it.</Review>

<rating>4</rating><text>My family has been coming here since 2001 and we treat friends to eat here whenever we could. The food is that great as is the family that owns it. It's always busy on weekends and holidays but thankfully they have takeout. Some changes have obviously occured, like changes in chefs, their hours of operation, and rise of cost of food (gradual consequence of cost of living); but the menu has stayed relatively the same. Warning: they stop accepting calls for orders thirty minutes before closing. Even lock their doors. Don't bother going unless you eat dinner relatively early.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>THIS RESTAURANT WAS YELLOW CARDED ON 9-18-2018 FOR FILTHY CONDITIONS AND THEY HAD TO THROW OUT THE FOOD!

AND WAS CLOSED DOWN DUE TO COCKROACHES ON FEB 18 2016!

I went into Silver Garden today for lunch and I always check the Sac County Restaurant Inspection Placard posted out by the front door. There's also a mobile app you can get on your phone to instantly check to see if it's a minor offense or something that might want you to think twice!

It stated that Silver Garden had a previous closure. So I kept walking until I could check it out. Here's the link:

emdinspections.saccounty…

I decided to go somewhere else because after you read the report from Feb 2016 regarding cockroaches crawling over food and "severe grease and food build up" it's hard to enjoy your meal.

Truth be told, honestly I've never eaten here but I wanted to have my fellow Yelpers fully informed when they make decisions where to eat and where to spend their hard earned money.

Appetite ruined....</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

okay so this Mongolian place is like always super busy I've been coming to this place since I can remember they are very authentic I mean it's a little outdated but if they're always on spot with their food you can always pile the food up high they're fine with that too so what I have to say about this Mongolian definitely five star I love you man golion and if you're in Sacramento I advise you to get off the freeway right there and go check it out.< /Review>

Food was absolutely terrible. Lots of it for a small price but I only took one bite before realizing how bad it was and throwing it away. There are about a dozen better chinese food restaurants 20 minutes away or less.</Text>

<Text>Food was absolutely terrible. Lots of it for a small price but I only took one bite before realizing how bad it was and throwing it away. There are about a dozen better chinese food restaurants 20 minutes away or less.< /Text>< Pics>

okay so this Mongolian place is like always super busy I've been coming to this place since I can remember they are very authentic I mean it's a little outdated but if they're always on spot with their food you can always pile the food up high they're fine with that too so what I have to say about this Mongolian definitely five star I love you man golion and if you're in Sacramento I advise you to get off the freeway right there and go check it out.<//Review>

<Review>Food and prices are always great. You can order Mongolian bbq which is made fresh right in front of you for around 10 or 12 bucks or you can order from the "chinese food" portion of their menu which averages from 6 to 30 bucks depending on what you order. I have had their soups, combo meals, and Mongolian bbq and I have never been disapointed. Order their cream cheese ragoons they are some of best I have ever had!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Rating based on the food. The location is a whole in the wall kinda run down resturant. In a cramped parking lot in a seedy, busy part of town. The resturant itself looks slightly rundown inside.However the Mongolian is top notch and I love going to this place.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>With a decor stuck in the 80's, this Chinese restaurant /Mongolian barbeque has a wide variety of food and good service.  The Chinese food is of the very deep fried variety. A bit to crunchy and tasteless for my taste. A plus was the sweet and sour soup; well flavored and not to sour. The Mongolian selection was fresh and varied.<//Text>< user>

The only reason I'm giving It 3 stars is the service really needs to be improved. We came in and we're sat next to a dirty table that remained dirty our entire evening.

Staff is getting friendlier... Food grom menu is good and I love their wings as well as their all you can eat Mongolian Bbq which comes with appetizers, a cup of rice and a cup of simple but good soup. Prices are very fair. Not fancy but nice to come with family & friends if u are looking for a casual comfortable place.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This is a Chinese food and Mongolian bbq place.  I have never eaten the Chinese food...the Mongolian bbq is so good.

They give you free eggroll...soup...and fried rice with your meal. They have all the typical items for Mongolian bbq. I really like this place a lot...because most places use water to finish cooking your bowl of food...but this place uses a sauce which allows for more flavor.

The staff was very friendly and assertive. Only $7.95 for lunch.< /Review>< pics>

I was told by the lady in the front that they have the best fried chicken and that was a lie, I was told I would get 7 pieces and received only 6 and my fried shrimp was mushy. Very unhappy and this will be my last choice for a restaurant next time in hungry.<//Review>

<Text>Mikey and I ate here on February 8, 2017. The food was gud and they give you soo much. The staff was friendly I would have given 3 and a half stars. Mikey voted for 3 because they did not  have certain things he wanted. All in all it was a nice evening out with mother and son,  his treat made it even better</Text>< time>

<Text>Anyone who doesn't like Silver Garden has no taste buds and is probably a communist. Best Chinese food in Sacramento and quite possibly the country. Portions are insanely plentiful for the price, especially considering the quality of the food. If you go there and hate it, best stick to Panda Express.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

This is one of our most regular restaurants, been eating here for at least 10 years. Not the most spectacular looking places, but staff is nice and food is good so that's what matters. I like that I can get a to-go box if I only do one bowl through the BBQ, because I never finish.< /Text>

<rating>2</rating><Review>I love Mongolian BBQ places and I may just have been to every to every one of them in the Sacramento and surrounding areas. Decor is older and the food was greasy and bland (sauces watered down?). The service was very fast and friendly. I will give this place another try at some point in time but I can't recommend it for now.

Edit; I had tied it a 2nd time and it was just as bad.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Great food, low price, and lots of it. Although the decor is somewhat dated, and there is simply no theme in the restaurant, what it lacks in visual appearance it makes up for in quality of food.</Text>< Time>

Mongolian bbq is very flavorful if you know how do it right. Make sure to put plenty of sauce in your bowl before it gets cooked, then add a little afterwards for a great meal.< /Text>

I don't get the negative feedback on this page. This is my wife and i's favorite chinese restaurant. We come here at least twice a month. Their Orange Chicken puts Panda Express to shame. Excellent portions as well. I never finish it in one serving. Great prices and good service. Highly recommend this place.</review>

<name>Kris Lamont< /name><Rating>5</Rating><text>MBBQ is always fresh products up to closing. The chinese food is wonderful. Fried chicken wings are addictive, the egg fu young is fluffy and consistently the best I've eaten. It is always busy which I feel is a tribute to the tastiness of the food. Staff is friendly, fast and keep on top of things. You don't ever feel rushed to leave. YUMMY GOODNESS.</text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Food is pretty good, I enjoy the honey walnut shrimp combo with white rice and chowmein . My husband always gets their chicken wings with added jalepenos same sides. It comes with a creamcheese wonton star and eggroll. Customer service is generally awesome however last time seemed our server had a sour attitude. Everyone has off days. Other than that pretty good place for chinese food and mongolian bbq.<//Review>

The food is good if you know what you like and are experinced at Mongolian BBQs. You have to stay attentive though so you grilling doesnt include cups of soy or house sauce. Lewrned that one thehard way. He cooking is linear so I dont understand that but there is a big box covering the power to the grill so maybe they need to concentrate on that instead of handling multiple meals like experienced places.

It is relatively clean also but overall I guess the asian restaruants have a lower threshhold for keeping things looking fresh and new!<//review>

<Text>Nothing I like more than a local Mom n Pop family oriented restaurant that serves excellent food! Friendly staff, good service, great food and extremely affordable price.

Been a huge fan of this place for over a decade. They have everything here. Awesome lunch & dinner combos. Chinese Food and Mongolian BBQ. A nice option to pick from.

Let's start with their Mongolian BBQ. I like it hot. Left over eating cold is even better cause it taste better than 15$ a La Bou Salad. For a good sized bowl filled with meat and vegetables, 1.5 scoop of all the dark sauces and 2 full scoops of oil ( combo of sesame and hot.) bowl of  cabbage soup, rice (steamed or fried) and egg rolls comes with it! Cheese wonton with dinner combo. Did I mention they make BEST cream cheese wontons in the world???

Their Chinese food is out of this world. I can't find another place to compare it with. Wor Wonton Soup is super hearty with chicken, beef shrimp loaded with cabbage. A meal within itself. Their Fried Rice and chow mein is un believably tasty. Walnut prawns, is so creamy it melts in your mouth. Chicken wings, cheese wontons, general chicken & triple delight. YUMM! I can't name everything off the menu. But EVERYTHING they make is good!

It's Chinese American Fusion and I am addicted to this place.< /Text>< response>
