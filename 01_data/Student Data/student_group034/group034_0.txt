Things sure changed after finishing college a decade ago, starting my career and then having twin sons. One BIG change was my exercise regimen and my body fat! I tried indoor fitness classes, lifting weights and running on treadmills but something was missing...fortunately, for me and hopefully you, I found it at ZogSports! It came down to being outside in beautiful LA, connecting with other people and playing fun sports under the sun. I've played soccer and volleyball for the past year and have grown friendships and decreased my fat while building muscle, endurance and stamina. I highly recommend ZogSports here in LA and around the country. To top it all off, Zog donates money to a charity of your team's choice if you win the season. Great company, great people and great to stay in shape. What are you waiting for?</text>

This is my third season of flag football with Zog and it gets better every time. I don't go into it with the plan to meet new people, but it's too easy and everyone is so great. We head to the bar after most games and it's truly a great break from the work week. & you have to love the charity aspect. & they occasionally have a photographer come and capture your interceptions.< /text>

Zog Sports is the BEST thing I've done for myself since moving to LA. I've played on multiple leagues over the last year, and formed some of my most cherished friendships. Having games spread throughout the work week is such a great way to decompress and have a little fun. I honestly tell everyone about Zog because it has become such a source of happiness for me. Highly recommend!!! Especially kickball :)< /Text>

Zog has helped to bring back the love I have for softball!!! It's been great playing for and winning 4 league championships with my team and looking forward to a 5th. The fact that we are playing for charities is a huge bonus in winning. Way to go Zog and way to go Upper Deckers!!!!< /Review>< pictures>

Though our team had the spirit but with a talent gap, I had a good time. Folks were nice and it's a well organized league. I recommend it.</Review>

<text>I've been in LA over ten years and have played in a number of sports leagues, ZogSports is a step above. They have the biggest variety of sports and levels, are available in the most neighborhoods across town, attract really fun people, and of course the charity tie-in is awesome.

I've tried several leagues since moving to Los Angeles, and have been very happy with my experience. Scheduling is consistent, seasons are affordable, and play is great for both people looking for a competitive experience, and those who just want to put fun and exercise together. Highly recommend.<//text>

<review>Zog sports really changed my life. I know that seems cheesy, but I moved out west to LA from Ohio and knew no one until I started playing kickball for Zog. Now, I've got more friends than I can count on all my fingers and toes. I even started working for them as a ref part time. A great company that gives back to the community through charity and building relationships across communities. Any city would be lucky to have them and any person would be lucky to lay in their leagues!</review>< pics>

<Date>1581449025180</Date><Rate>5</Rate><review>This is the first time my coworkers and I joined ZogSports Basketball league and simply put, we are having a great/fantastic time. Everything is organized (no confusion in schedule, games always promptly start on time, communication for any questions always answered), people in the league are respectable (surprisingly no douchebags... actually maybe one but that's it), and the competition seems pretty balanced. Each venue/gym we play at seems to have their own set of refs, meaning some places the refs like to call more fouls, another place the refs let the games be a little more free flowing with less calls, nonetheless, all fun and games.

Quick shout out to Desi (which I believe is short for Desiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii) Carson for always being on top of things and going above/beyond to answer questions/handle any problems. She gets things done and isn't afraid to punch you in the throat with facts/jokes/knowledge. Overall, my communication with the Zogsports team has always been pleasant, efficient, and informative.

All in all, hoping this smooth ride continues and we return for the following season.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>I love this organization. Whether you're looking to continue / re-establish your connection to sports, get to know folks in your community, or just try something new - Zog is a great outlet to be part of. Organized and friendly culture, s/o Desi!

Being from out of state: I think the best feature they have is the option to enter as a free-agent. I've made some amazing friends thru Zog and am going into my 4th year.

Happy to play here.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I have played in a few different leagues and I have stuck with zog through several seasons because it is fantastic. The atmosphere is fun and the people are amazing. It's competitive enough but still fun and welcoming. Also they have plenty of refs which is a struggle in many leagues I have played in and they have quality equipment. Also the charity prize is a great touch. I highly recommend giving zog a try if you are looking for a league to join.<//Review>

ZogSports is amazing to be a part of!  Not only do you get to be active and play the sports you loved as a kid, you get to give back to charity, and meet great people during happy hour!  I owe ZogSports everything for introducing me to people I consider friends for life!  Shout out to Matt, Josh, and Casey for making it happen everyday!< /Text>

<Review>Always have had great experiences playing with Zog. Was expecting to have some fun playing with friends and ended up having a great experience meeting new people and making new friends on every team we played. The refs (especially this past season) are very fair and friendly.  Despite there being some definite competition on the field, Zog manages to foster a good sense of comradery among all the players both during the game and afterwards at the bar!
Constantly look forward to game nights as a great workout and break from work.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b8a52b94885b:0xced5a39fa3efd059<//Gmap_id></record>

ZogSports has been a fun and easy way to meet new friends and be active and play a variety of sports.  I've really enjoyed playing softball and beach volleyball throughout the years and curious to try other sports.  The staff are friendly and super helpful, and always try to make games fun and competitive and there is a large variety of shirt colors :).  It's also great to be able to play for charity!<//review>

This league is a blast! I had soooooo much fun. It brought back a moment of my childhood that meant a lot to me. Unfortunately I was injured first game... however, Matt took great care of me and my membership with ZogSports. He was helpful through the entire process and very timely on getting back to me when it mattered most. Despite my injury, I HIGHLY recommend ZogSports (especially for soccer). It was a blast while it lasted. Old injuries suck - keep good care of your knees!</review>

I joined ZogSports since I moved to LA four years ago! I didn't a lot of people when I moved here and playing for Zog has allowed me to meet cool people while playing a game we all love. We are now four years in with our team and every season our team grows closer and we get better, while the league becomes more competitive. I have played in many different soccer leagues in LA and Zog is by far the most organized and the one with the best balance of fun and competitiveness! Thank you all at Zog for making this league the best co-ed soccer league in all Los Angeles and to many more years of playing!< /Text>

I love ZogSports! I've made so many friends and met so many wonderful people competing in ZogSports LA Softball every Sunday! The games are co-ed with always friendly competition, super awesome people on my team and the teams we compete + ZogSports has happy hour deals with a nearby bar where we can connect further before or after our games. I've been playing in ZogSports Softball each season since 2014 and I never want it to end! Matt Worley and his staff do a great job organizing it all and makes me look forward to Sundays getting to play softball :)</review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Season after season of good experiences until this Spring. The regular field for soccer had to cancel and instead of refunding everybody they tried cobbling together fields and games. The result was double bookings, confusion, cancelled games, and entire teams not showing up due to the mess Zog created. I brought this to the attention of Zog staff who told me that they are as frustrated as me over this. No, you're not. You are responsible for the confusion and missed games. Our last 2 weeks (out of 6) we had no opponent. They refused any refund or partial credit for a future season until days and days of back and forth emails detailing their poor administration of the league, and even then it was a trivial amount and still they refuse to acknowledge their faults. Unacceptable behavior, take responsibility for your mistakes.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Zog has provided me several years of good times with great people, and the gratification of social give back.  All of my interactions with the LA office have been stellar.  I've dealt with Josh Ellis the most and I appreciate that he follows through, does what he says he will, and that he responds to my many emails.  Mad props.<//Review>

I've been playing with Zog since 2013.  After my first season with them,  I was hooked!  Zog has divisions for all levels of play and although I joined with a few friends, I've added many more from the teammates I've had over the years.  I've played football, beach volleyball and indoor volleyball with them.  They've really expanded leagues to different areas of the city, so now it's not just a Westside league.  It's a great way to stay active, play organized sports and enjoy socializing all while giving to charity!<//text>

I have been playing with Zogsports Softball for almost a year now, and I still love it!  I wanted a way to meet new people and get some exercise, and this is the perfect situation for both.  It's a good deal for the price, and you can sign up as a team or individual player.  I also tried out the bowling league for a season as well.  Matt, from the softball league, is very friendly and easy to communicate with, and is eager to help answer any questions.  I highly recommend Zogsports to anyone looking for a fun recreational sports league!< /Review>

If I could leave negative stars, I would.  This league is a complete mess.  They can't seem to put together a schedule -- they change game times last minute (without informing the teams) and sometimes forget to even schedule games entirely.  AND IT'S SO EXPENSIVE! Last season they had a "mix up" with our schedule 3 times! WE ONLY HAVE 6 GAMES.  And, when you complain, they do absolutely nothing to remedy the issue. This league is dying and a waste of money.  Never coming back</Text>

<Review>I've played in 2 league with Zog thus far and can honestly say that I've had the best time ever. Not only is this a great way to meet people, but you don't even realize that you're getting a legit workout in while having fun! To top it all off, Zog does a great job by donating to the championship team's charity of choice instead of wasting money on a useless trophy. 12/10 recommend you joining a ZogSports league!</Review>< time>

Zog is fun, the people you meet are great, fun and funny. You make new friends. Matt Worley is always helpful, he came through for me on many occasions, whether it was an answer to a specific question, or coming through with a tee shirt request. I was Keats assisted in a quick, responsible and timely manner<//Text>

<Review>At this point, I've participated in five or six seasons of beach volleyball with Zog.  I've met some great people - several of whom I now play with regularly.  I've found that the league has a really good balance of being competitive-but-not-too-competitive and social.  The only issue I've run into is that the league could sometimes do a better job of evaluating players to ensure they're being placed at the right level.  Especially in a sport like beach volleyball, one or two weak players (relative to the rest of the team) can leave a team non-competitive for a whole season, so that's something to look out for.  With that in mind, I suggest, if possible, finding reliable folks at your level of play and forming a team with them, that way you know who you'll be playing with heading into the season.  In any case, my experience with Zog has been great.  I look forward to my games every weekend, and expect to play in their leagues for many more seasons going forward.  Oh, and Casey, Zog's GM for LA, does an excellent job and has always been super responsive when I've reached out with random questions.  In general, their staff has been very positive in my interactions with them.< /Review>< Resp>

They are truly one of the GREAT organizations out there, between their charity oriented ideals, fun loving referees, and a few too many beers Dog Sports Makes me feel like I belong....

I started playing with Zog well over a year ago now. And it is the highlight of my week. So much so that if I have to miss game the extra week waiting weighs heavy on my heart. Everyone at Zog (football is my experience with them) is friendly and competitive. I've met people with remarkably disparate levels of experience and everyone has a blast. If you have ever thought about joining a recreational anything league. Consider Zog, we'd all be happy to have you.
And then play you.
And then drink with you.</Text>

TL;DR  Multiple 3 team leagues, poor communication, missing/late refs

3-team leagues are really a bummer. You play a double header every other week against the same people, and eventually people get tired of it, which results in forfeits nearly every week. I made the mistake of signing up for 2 Zog leagues at the same time (flag football and soccer), and it turned out that they both only had enough players for 3 teams.

Here's a pretty good snapshot of how disorganized Zog is:  During Week 2 of my Hollywood Friday night soccer league, there was no ref. Afterwards, we went to the bar that's partnered with the league (you get deals on drinks). The manager at the restaurant literally asked, "What's Zog?" He had no idea what we were talking about.

The league contact, Jeffrey Hajek, hardly replies to any emails. I sent him 4 emails asking to put me in touch with another Zog representative to talk about the 3-team league issue, and he never did. Four emails.

My best advice is to do LASportsnet or Clubwaka. If you need to do Zog, be sure to ask how many people are in the league before you sign up. If they don't tell you, or something seems a little off, don't sign up.

Maybe Zog is better in Santa Monica, but in Hollywood, it's pretty bad.

*****As a disclaimer, the Hollywood Basketball league is actually great (run by Barbara Davis). Great refs, plenty of teams, and well-organized. Other than that, I wouldn't do any Zog sport in the valley.< /Text>

Zog Sports is legit.  I've played basketball through Zog for 4+ years now and have always been impressed with the facilities they utilize and the quality of the Zog staff.  Casey has been particularly helpful and friendly.  I started out playing on a team full of random guys that she just happened to pair together.  Four years later the same team still plays together and brings home championships.  Nothing but positive things to say about Zog!</Review>

<review>There's not enough good things I can say about Zog! Sports, playing for great causes, staying active, drinking, making new friends,  - what more could you ask for? Matt, who started the LA branch of ZogSports, is the best! He really tries to make everything equally competitive, fun, and social for everyone - you might even see him out on the field. I've been in a couple other co-rec leagues for football and basketball, but nothing compares to the atmosphere that Zog provides. My personal favorite is the Touch Football League in Santa Monica on Sundays and, the newest location, Hollywood on Saturdays. If you're looking to get some exercise, meet new people, and/or play for your favorite charity, I guarantee that signing up for Zog will be one of the best decisions you'll ever make!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

If you want to play for fun and you are not overly competitive this is the league for you. As for myself I have played competitive softball pretty much all my life not to mention i have played in college too so I find the level of competiveness a little on the weak side. I have met some cool people and they do give some money to charity so that's a good thing. Not sure how much goes to them but at least they donate. I think that's their motto, playing for a cause since their league fees are super expensive.

There a few things I dislike about the league. One is that they claim that we have a sponsor but never get anything from the sponsor. So how is that sponsorship? Not sure about that one. I would usually not say anything about it but they put the sponsor on the shirts that WE pay for. Shouldn't we decide if we want the sponsor logo on our shirts or not? What happens if we don't like the sponsor ? haha anyway...

Second thing I dislike is that some of the umpires are new never had experience umping a game. They train them which is fine but are not completely aware of the rules. This causes a lot of conflicts between teams of who is right an who is wrong.

Lastly, this is a 'for profit' organization so the fees are pretty high compared to other leagues. This league only has seven games plus playoffs. If you don't mind paying that then give it a GO.

Hope this helps...< /Text>

< Review>
I have now played 2 full seasons for the ZogSportsLA softball leagues (Sunday league winter & Tuesday night winter league) and both were equally incredible and special.  The Sunday league I joined with a friend who I play beach volleyball with (we met this year actually) and we didn't do very well, but I got to meet her friends (my teammates) and we all bonded in a way I didn't think we could.  The Tuesday league however was where the magic happened.  As a group of free agents we came together to play in the most amazing league -the Tuesday night westchester league - a league I had not played in since I was a kid playing with my mom and dad on our church league in westchester. Thanks to Casey ;) she convinced me to play and I am so glad I did, otherwise I would not have met my incredible team!!  ZogSportsLA allows you to express your competitive side while making friends in a positive reinforced environment welcome to all skill levels and ages :)< /Review>

<text>Zog has been one of the most important aspects of my life in LA. Through Zog, not only have I had countless hours of fun, but more importantly I have developed some friendships that now exist outside of playing sports and will last forever. A special shout out to Josh Ellis for always taking special care to enhance my and everyone else's Zog experience by accommodating any and all requests and successfully managing to keep hundreds of people happy even though it means he spends hours upon hours rearranging a season schedule or making phone calls to make sure that we always have access to the best fields, facilities, and dining/ drinking establishments.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Fast friendly service.  Ample parking. A bit pricey for a sandwich but packed with quality ingredients and filled with flavor. It all balances out in the end. Yes, I would suggest this location to friends and family.<//review>

Been coming here for years now. It’s the local “cheers” bar in Tierrasanta where every one knows your name ... the drinks are cheap here! $3.50 well drinks and many beers to choose from - draft or bottle. They have mini pitchers which is the way to go. Good bar food .. $2.00 taco Tuesdays and 50 cent wings on Thursdays. Their burgers are the best. The crowd here can vary depending on the time of day. Most of the locals from the neighborhood are here earlier in the day through happy hour. (Happy hour is 7 am - 7 pm).  They are a special group of really nice people ranging from early 20’s up to 85 yo! After 8 pm is when the much younger crowd files in. They have a band every Friday night with no cover. Pool tables, dart board and music!!  Weekends used to be for football and was a blast but sadly they decided not to renew their football package so you’re stuck watching whatever happens to be televised on a local channel. This is a fun local dive with great prices.</text>

Karaoke was fun and after I got to know all of the regulars everyone was really cool. I knew the names of Maria, Joey, Lelu and they'd chat with me while smoking except for one woman who walked away from me the first time I said hello.

I will never return because this same woman accused me of mooching immediately after a friend bought me my beer. After she accused me to the manager, he accosted me, saying if I don't buy the next one i have to leave, and I have since to return. I had never felt disrespected at the bar before the manager took it upon himself.</review></record></dataset><record>

Great location but every time we would go in to get food, they didn’t have  certain items on the menu. Drinks were ok, because we just got a pitcher of beer mostly and sat at the bar. But when you plan to go out to drink and plan on staying a while you want to have a snack. So it would make our visits very short, we would invite coworkers/friends and family but they didn’t want to come back because of the food and service. We kept trying to come back in hopes that maybe the service and food is better but nothing after 4 years has changed.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dbfe3fb6879197:0x730fd5ddcdc42c79</GmapID><time>1602116238481</time></record>

<Review>The decorations look really cool. The drinks taste nice, and not so expensive.
The only issue can be that the music might be too loud for a place that people prefer to sit and talk rather than to dance.< /Review><userid>111126654498936014527< /userid>< pictures>

Great place to hang out... Everyone is friendly... I have had some fun times watching a game or just chatting with another patron... I am more of a Daytime guy... I hear it's great at night... Seth really has changed this place around and it seems he is always making it better... My favorite neighborhood bar without a doubt... They don't serve food... But, there is like 4 restaurants in the strip center that will bring your food over... Check it out...</review>

Cougar Karaoke 1 or 2 nights a week.

I told her wings then when they came out she threw the paper towels at me and hasn't even checked on me been to busy talking to other customers and having conversations about God there are only 9 people including myself so disappointed in the service here.< /Text><Time>1584298748371<//Time><response>None</response>< UserId.>

Laid back and chill. Love this bar and by far, my favorite around. They have amazing deals, like happy hour on food (I recommend the potatoe skins), and free pool on Sunday and Monday. They have an electronic dart board too that's pretty fun, once you figure out how to use it. They have karaoke on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 9pm from what I've heard; I haven't gone during those times, but I cant wait for it.< /review>

<Review>Local hole in the wall bar where everyone knows everyone. Decent priced drinks and food is mediocre. JoJo is the good cook, others not so much. When I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare, I got it well done. When I told the kitchen manager Ryan this he said “oh I’ll make sure it’s right next time.” He didn’t even bother to make it right the same day. Oh and to add, some of the bartenders are drunk and pick fights with people.<//Review>< pictures>

Pretty empty for Football on Sunday, but fills up during afternoon. Can't beat the beer/drink prices. Food decent and cheap too! No NFL Sunday ticket though, although all the broadcast games were on multiple TV's.<//Review>

Great neighborhood bar ! Very good food, awesome bartenders and nightly entertainment. 2 pool tables, darts and multiple T.V's with all the relative sports. Sun a.m. breakfast and football a real treat.</Text>

Had a little time to kill and stopped in JP's Pub. It appeared to be a great spot. There were a few friendly regulars around the bar. The drinks were very reasonably priced. The service was prompt and friendly.

I don't live very close so I won't become a regular but I'll definitely be a return customer ... probably once a month when I'm in the area.</review>

I am local to the bar and decided to have my birthday party here. I called today because it was for tomorrow and spoke to a manager named Darin. I let him know we would have 20 or 30 people and I would be in about 5 pm to save some tables. He said, "no that's too many people and you will take up too many tables." I thought he was joking. I asked, "are you seriously telling me that because it's a busy night for you that my party of 20 to 30 people who are heavy drinkers and will be there for hours are not welcome?" He said, "well you'd leave no other tables for others." Wow....just WOW.  Then he proceeds to tell me that he will do a room charge for me for $10/head. Oh so you do have the room and now want to charge us additionally bc we chose this location? Again, WOW. When I told him that I would call the owner back sometime and I would make sure this goes viral, he said, "oh ok." And hung up on me.

I am sure if he's the one managing this account then this will be deleted. Again, WOW.< /Review>

Just another dive bar.  However, the service is friendly and the beer is cold.  Sometimes they are a little short staffed, but the service is pretty good.  This is a busy place a lot of people go, so you dont feel 'sad' drinking here.<//text>

I recently moved to Tierrasanta and I drive by JP's everyday.  I was a little discouraged to go in because there are always lot of bikers out in front and seemed like a much older crowd.  It was a random tuesday night and a friend and I decided to go in and check it out.  Surprisingly, it was larger than I expected with pool tables and a karaoke section.  Since it was during the holidays the place was decked out with a Christmas tree, lights and decorations which made it feel very warm and seasonal.  We sat down away from the bar (which was full) and ordered two mixed drinks during happy hour.  Pretty great prices at 2.50 a drink!  Overall it was a chill place and close to home so will probably come back to check out Karaoke sometime.< /review>

<text>It's definitely a dive bar, but free pool several nights a week is worth it. Other than that there's not much to write home about. Drinks and prices are ok, staff is ok.

It is actually much bigger inside than it looks like from outside.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dbfe3fb6879197:0x730fd5ddcdc42c79< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I talked with Steve about a piece of siding that I needed to replace and he helped me figure out exactly what I needed to match it. Then the shipping charges were added up and he knew it was too high for one piece. He instead told me the name of a competitor that is located in my state and had me write down exactly what to tell them so I could get what I needed. This was after spending a big chunk of time with me and not even getting my business because of the unavoidably high shipping cost. I feel kinda bad that I had to go through someone else after all his work. This is a guy that knows what he is talking about and will put the customer first. I was very impressed and thankful for his assistance. (I had read some reviews that the customer service was lacking, which made me nervous to contact them. I think his customer service was great. He isn’t bubbly, but he is an expert and very professional.) I strongly suggest going through Hemet! Thanks!< /review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We have been purchasing metal siding and sheeting from Steve for 15+ years. Steve is extremely knowledgeable on metal siding patterns and has kept us from buying the wrong metal many times. Keep up the great work Steve.
Thanks

I wanted to say a couple things about this place. I’ve been coming to them for years.. they are the nicest more kind professional people you will meet. They are great and fixing systems and more, but also has a great selection for sale. I will continue to always come here. 5 stars 100%. Thank you for always being so kind and great!< /text>

The deals are right on for a 2nd time visiting!  Picked up an Xbox1 and very happy with the price and warranties, etc.  I took my son with me and together we had a wonderful experience!

Broke my super smash edition joycon and they fixed it, like it never happened. Super reasonable pricing too; they won't charge you for what you don't need and they get the job done. The number one go to spot if you need any repairs on a any gaming system; new or old. Quality service, fast and friendly, will definitely be coming back to them for any and all my gaming repair needs.<//text>

Ps4 was overheating is very loud havent used it for a good 3 months. They took it in and fixed my ps4 pro within a day at reasonable price, customer service is great due in part that they explain how to further the life of your ps4. Overall great service if i have any more problems i will be coming here from now on.< /Text>

I just wanted to say that the gentleman running the shop is wonderful. He was great over the phone when I wanted to know if he had 2 specific wii games and let me know it was in stock and how much it was. I wanted a wii & 2 old games for my birthday and im glad i called him. Made my birthday hunt stress free. He was very kind and helpful instore as well and went above & beyond. The prices are fair especially as these games aren't made anymore. He made sure the games were clean and working. Ill Definitely be coming back for any repairs or accessories, thank you.<//text>

EDIT: I received a call from a gentleman who was very apologetic. He stated the opening staff had called off and he was unable to get there in an adequate amount of time. He then stated that he would deliver my PS4 to my home for the inconvenience, 30 minutes from the store.

This level of customer service and his kindness warrant the 5/5 star review. Although my entire morning was wasted today, I work in the hospitality industry and I know good customer service. Thank you for taking ownership of the issue and making it right.

Original 1 star review: I live pretty far from this store and I have a tight work schedule, so I timed my visit to pick up my PS4 exactly at 10:30am when the store is supposed to open. It’s now 11:20am and it’s still closed! There is no one here and the gates are still up.

If you are scheduled to open up at 10:30am, you’re expected to open up at that time. That’s basic business. These guys are friendly enough but this is incredibly inconvenient.< /Review>

<review>I've been going to this store for a few years now and it couldn't be better! Instant nostalgia when you walk in, Joe and the whole staff are always honest and give great customer service! If you have something that needs fixing, they'll fix it. If something's defective, they'll fix it. If you aren't satisfied with something, they'll fix it! If you have a bad relationship, I'm sure they could fix that, too.

My point is that this store is one of this town's hidden gems! If you need games, have old games/systems that need repair, or even systems you want to recycle, go down there and give them a try!

Thanks GameGeeks for all you've done<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

So I’m trying to get some controllers repaired and I call in and ask about price range and timeframe, I’m told it will be about $50 to fix and I was told over the phone it would take tops 2-3 hrs, so I let the guy know That works for me and head over to drop them off. Upon arriving I talk over the issues with some other guy?(not sure if it was the same guy on the phone) as he’s finishing with his explanation he assured me it will be no longer than 2-3 business days, assuming he said that just to give himself some extra time and finish before hand I agreed to the service and dropped it off Tuesday, Saturday comes around no call or anything so I pull up to the shop a little before noon when they should be open according to the sign at the door, and guess what closed, so yesterday which was the sixth day (they close Sunday’s) I drove by after work and was told by a worker, after he had been looking for my controllers as he couldn’t seem to find them, that I’d have to wait till today, because apparently the guy that was working on them didn’t finish closing them? So now I’ve waited a whole week on a fix I was told would take 2-3 hours.... then assured would be no longer than 3 business days, so I finally pick up my controllers, pay for my service, he tells me he gave me a discount approximately $6, I notice I had asked for my thumb grips replaced as well and they were left untouched, ask about it and he tells me he has an order coming in next week and he’ll hook me up with them, at that point I just want to get home and test it
Right away I see the thumb stick drift that was supposed to be worked on has the exact same issue. Overall not a great experience.
Lots of wasted time and trips.
Now I have to call and probably drop off for another week and hope it gets fixed correctly.< /text>

(apprently this is a common failure on the XBOX X, not to be confused with the Black Screen of Death we comes across from time to time). I was refered to this shop by other gamers and I was extremely surprised at their level of customer service, friendliness, pricing and quick turnaround. I was called the same day with an estimate for repairs, I gave them the OK and the next day my console was ready for pick up. Total turn around, less than 24 hours!!! This has to be OC's gamers choice of console surgery. Good work, highly recommended.< /text>< Pics>

Great place! I worked with Joe. He was very kind and polite. Gamegeeks does great work and has very reasonable prices. And they fix the old stuff! They repaired 2 original Xboxes for me. No other place was willing to even try. This is a great place, I highly recommend it. I'll be going back for anything else I need done.<//text>

<review>They buy your game and console for a low price and sell it for three time than what they pay you. I ask them how much is the PlayStation 2 Half-Life. I was shock when they said hundred something. Couple months later I bought Half-Life with Metal Gear Solid 2 and Extermination for fifteen buck on eBay</review>< pics>

I love this place. This place is such an amazing store to go to. It's very family friendly hole in the wall shop that everyone should buy, sell and trade here. I love new and old games and I'll be coming here every often to complete my console collection. This is by far the best game shop that I've ever seen.<//Review>

< review>
I went to this shop in Garden Grove travelling from Long beach, Joe and his associate really helped me out with a Sega Saturn. Answered my questions, tested it, cleaned it and even gave me a new battery for the save system when i purchased it. Very prompt and courteous service. They have a neat selection of games and controllers too. Great thing is they also do warranty and repairs on electronics.  I recommend this place as a good place for retro game fix and electronic care.< /review>

This place is amazing! I have never seen so much quality vintage gaming supplies in my life! NES, PS1, Sega Genesis, and even stuff older than that. Tons of vintage games and consoles- even some in the box! I would even come here just to ogle the stock, but of course they had something I wanted. :) Owner is super nice, very attentive to customers. They also do repairs. This place is worth a visit even if you have a long drive.<//review>

<review>The employees here are awesome and their boss or supervisor whatever he is is incredibly helpful. They always go out of their way to give satisfaction to return customers and make new customers feel welcome with open arms. They answer questions about retro games and consoles with great accuracy and will give you their honest opinion on newer games even if it's a negative response that would turn you off from buying it. Every time I've visited the employees are more concerned about you having a good experience rather than just sell sell sell.  Overall great store and great atmosphere.< /review>< pictures>

These guys are great. They had my ps4 repaired in just a few hours. They were very polite and courteous, and gave me a great price. They also took the time to explain to me what exactly was wrong with my console and told me how to avoid problems in the future. I will definitely be coming back in the future.</Review>

I am sitting out here currently it is 1125 and they are closed. I looked them up online and it said 1030-8pm. Their signs say 1030-8pm. What is going on with this place? I read another review where they were late to open up! If this is an on going thing just move your business hours back if your people can’t get to work on time or fire them and hire people that will show up.<//text>

Awful service. Said because I am a woman, I don’t understand how to repair a video game console. (Stated that if I were a man, I would know) Even hung up on me when I said he had insulted me. Didn’t answer my questions.<//review>

Very friendly service this guy is actually a "game geek". He helped me find the part I needed and even offered to help me if I needed help installing it and gave me advise. I know people write reviews like this all the time but believe me it's true I highly recommend them if you love gaming .</Text>

I'm thankful to have found this place! They fixed our water damaged nitendo 3ds at a fair and affordable price!
A week ago, I accidentally washed my husband's nitendo 3ds in a blanket. We immediately tried to save it by putting it in the sun and drying it inside rice. We waited at least 4 days before attempting to turn it on. To my dismay, it never turned on. But, after calling a few places and getting recommended to try this place, Game Geeks offered a free check up and told us they would see about fixing it. If the price to fix it went above the price of the game system or if it was too damaged to fix, they promise to let us know. I was very skeptical that this could be fixed! However, after 3 days, Game Geeks notified us stating that the 3ds was fixed with all the memory even intact!  It was pretty much a miracle and dream for both me and my husband! Thank you Game Geeks!
I highly recommend you come here for any system or phone repairs. They even said they do computer repairs. The team and staff are very knowledgeable and good at what they do. They are very trustworthy as well! Oh, and this store has a bunch of cool, retro games too if that's what you are looking for.<//Text>

<Review>Best game place to get systems and fix any electronic device and system.  I always go to this place for all of my electronic and gaming needs.  The team they have is the best they always take care of me and always get my request done in a timely manner.  Prices are also the best way better than any other game store I've been too.  They have always beaten other prices of all the other game stores.  I recommend this store to anyone that needs games, game systems, iPods, iPads, phones, computers, just your any electronic gaming experience.</Review><userid>110893435668318245431</userid><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pics>

<review>I came here to support this mom and pop store bc I usually shop at GameStop. As soon as I went in the store I noticed that it was organized but very small. Within 5min in the store I felt very claustrophobic. The guest service here wasn't good, nobody greeted me or even acknowledge that I was browsing the store, this is a surprise to me bc it's run by Asians and they are usually nice, but not here. The games were overpriced and felt that most of the games here been abandoned bc of all the dust.
I will definitely won't be coming here anytime soon. For now I'll stick to Amazon, eBay and GameStop, at least they are nicer and acknowledge their customers.</review>< Gmap_id>

Games I wanted were either not for sale (so many console items are display only) game was  lost when it came to finding the disc of what I wanted also.  Prices on most things are eBay even higher even on old Xbox one common stuff.

<review>They rip you off on games and I have bought 2 controllers from them that don't work and when I returned one for them to fix, they never got back to me for 2 weeks. When I went in to ask they told me they couldn't fix it and couldn't give me a refund but gave me another remote only for it to not work</review><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

<Text>Been here 4 times now and I noticed that it's always clean and organized for the most part, but sometimes it's under staff or over staffed; and everybody that I saw work there can speak good English and Vietnamese, they are nice while you ask questions, and they always keep a positive vibe there.
People who write a bad review about somewhere, and they haven't been there in person are ignorant.
I think you should give this place a try before you go to GameStop/Best Buy because GameGeeks has everything that GameStop/Best Buy has, but GameGeeks has things at a cheaper price and more things that GameStop/Best Buy don't have; like for example a Play Station, Nintendo 64, and much more.
I hope my review help some people out on choosing if this is the place to go to.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Date>

<review>Friendly service and tasty treats. They have a clean, nice ambiance and ladies behind the counter were friendly and helpful. They have a large selection of ice cream, shakes, crazy pineapples, watermelons, and apples. They have a staya of options to choose from. I will definitely be going back and would highly recommend.</review>< pics>

Absolutely the BESTEST ice cream anywhere!!! The owner and her team deserve props. They are a very friendly, helpful and kind group of women.

<Text>The self-service kiosk at this location fails to work in nine times out of ten and the workers here are unbelievably rude. I was not allowed to purchase postage for a large letter to be mailed later and was told if I purchased postage, they couldn’t give the envelope back to me. Only a government entity could remain in business being run in this manner.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dd267da4efa2cb:0xe648b2141e6f7a7e</gmapID>< userid>

<Review>This place is a HOT MESS! There was an hour and a half wait today! I skipped the line and paid double to use the self-service instead of sending it media mail (which has to be done at the counter). They are completely understaffed with only two employees at the window yet they can have numerous management walking around? Get behind the counter and help out! Sure, have one manager go around to assist but taxpayer dollars would be better spent if this place could figure out how to be organized. Ugh. And don't even get me started on the passport fiasco! They're jumbled in with people standing in line so there should be a SEPARATE area for passports. Just because this is a government agency, doesn't mean it automatically has to be dreaded like the DMV. Figure it out!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

They lack security and don't have working cameras and too many hobos sleeping and hanging out there at night. Even people in cars stay there all night steeling from open boxes like these. See pictures of what we pay for. Right that must be security alarm tape.<//review>

I live in Fountain Valley but always go to Huntington Beach USPS on Warner close to Golden West. They always met my expectation in regards to controlling the line if you have people that needs to mail out 50 or 100 packages. One more good point about them is the front desk agent, specifically the representative named Thuy. I was there on Tuesday and Wednesday and would like to thank her for being very courteous, nice, patient for thoroughly went through to explain to me different options for my mail. Most importantly she always have a happy face when dealing with me. Thanks Thuy for such professional and courteous attitude. Hopefully everyone is able to run into a USPS representative as nice as you are.</review>

Hit or miss at this office. I either get very friendly people or the complete opposite. Waiting is usually long unless you get lucky. One of the managers needs to relax and realize that yelling at you workers in front of customers is not the way to do things.<//Review>

I never take the time to publicly rate things as I hate Yelp but OMG this was by far the worst post office experience of my life. Go anywhere else by all means. 1 hour of my day gone and I'm not the only one. The tension from people waiting and not getting the service they need is palpable. I do not understand how one entity can do so fully incompetent of the publicly needs.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Today is Monday November 16th, 2020. This review is intended to be a positive & historical review for the USPS. Earlier this year the US 🇺🇸 was hit with The COVID~19 Pandemic. Because of this, Society@Large has been encouraged to use the USPS for the delivery of meds and so on, including our Mail in ballots due to be postmart no later than November 3rd, 2020. We are now in the 2nd foreseeable and expected wave of The COVID~19 Pandemic when cases and deaths are on the rise once again and being historically documented. We just had a Presidential Election surrounded with suspicions of "alleged" Postal worker frauds & fraudulent activities within the USPS.
I just want say that after the rise in requested Postal deliveries from Society@Large on the USPS when bombarded with so much more needed services at the beginning of The COVID~19 Pandemic, the USPS has truly gone above and beyond in their dedication and service for the US. Thank you so much for rising to this important yet unfortunate occasion.
Great Job USPS! 👍🏼 Great Job! 👍🏼< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
USPS misplaced the same package twice. So I finally went to this post office and tried to track down the package. I gave the clerk the tracking number. She tells me the package is still in Los Angeles. I showed her the latest USPS Tracking info from my phone that clearly shows package left Anaheim location and still not arrived after 4 days. She says "I don't care what it says. It's still in Los Angeles" Hahaha. It was like talking to a 5 year old who doesn't know how to read< /Review>

<review>Get your passports here! Come in with your application filled out with supporting documents ready. Make the appointment online. It takes 15 minutes for one person with photos. I don’t understand why people complain. If you have an entire family of passports to apply for, it obviously takes longer. This is by far the best post office I’ve ever used. Keep doing what you do!</review>< Pics>

<review>This place has been really sketchy lately, mail coming super late in the evening now after leaving early early morning. Had a package go missing that they eventually found in a bin (Yet was scanned as delivered when it had not been), the people at the windows can be a bit rude. There are great workers here like Jeff, Harry and others. But some act like its a jail, come mail your packages convict kinda mindset. They are focused on Passports, they prioritize this at times over taking U.S. Mail customers. They also push the automated kiosk. Be aware the scan these packages get is different from a window scan, it states it was mailed at a self service kiosk vs acceptance until it is scanned again. They will have one person at the window with a long line and will send one of the only workers out in a red vest to roam around, get them at the window accepting customers packages. Overall, I am a big fan of USPS and they do a great job overall. But this place has issues, I think it starts at the top on who is making decisions.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Delivery people won’t deliver packages to entire complex. Now I have to pick up from local usps which is overwhelmed because the core job of a mail delivery person is not being done. Might as well shut it all down and let it be absorbed by UPS.< /Review>

Staff was rude, short and snotty. They were helping me, and told me to stay there while they pulled other people in line in front of me while I was standing there. Not to mention I was slowly pushed out of the way while she helped others right in front of me. The line was not long, and there was no reason for this. I grabbed my stuff and moved down to another register where the gentleman was nice and helpful. Every time I go into this post office everyone seems like they hate their job, and are incredibly rude, and just trying to go through the motions and get everyone out as soon as possible. I do recommend the post office on Magnolia and Atlanta in Huntington Beach. They are ALWAYS friendly, kind and helpful.</Text>

Waited all day for a priority mail letter that was supposed to be delivered by 3 p.m. and didn't get it. I had tracking activated on my phone to make sure that it came through. At 1:29 I get a notification that a delivery attempt was made but the business was closed. I'm sitting 3' from the front door with 3 cars in the parking lot with more than just me here. This isn't the first time this has happened - USPS is an absolute joke< /Review>

<review>Would give them 0 stars if possible. Once again they say they pick up my Priority Mail packages when, in fact, they are still in the same spot as I left them this morning. Package pick up is successful once out of 10 times. They say they pick up, but don't. If they can't complete the service, then don't offer it. Tried to talk to someone last time this occurred, but to no avail. Do not ever use their pickup service, you will be sorely disappointed.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This is a follow up of my other review about a month ago. As I said the man from the post office who was supposed to help people with the passport application didn't even look at me. I asked him about the documentation I had to send, but he ignored me. Now, one month later I receive a correspondence from the Department of State telling me that my documentation was incomplete. Now I have to spend time and money going back to the post office to send the documents that were missing. Luckily my trip is not until 2 months from now.</Review>

Seconding that the passport people are incredibly rude.  I was trying to get my packet in order and the gentleman "helping" me wouldn't give me a second to figure out where one of my pages were.  Then, when I found it and told my friend we'd go elsewhere for her passport when we were done, he told me I needed an attitude adjustment.  I'm not a goddamn teenager, you're an old man on a power trip with people's livelihoods.< /Review>

Today 4-3-19 I visited this post office and only one attendant was working.  The line had about 15 people waiting.  Wow!  Bad service.  A blonde lady was sitting down in the right back part of area and was just watching.  Totally bad service at this post office.  It's sad to be powerless where no one seems to care.< /Review>

<Review>There is something wrong about how this place operates.
I've consistently gotten notifications of delayed deliveries because of some terrible excuse of "incorrect address." There is -nothing- incorrect about my address and there has -never- been anything incorrect about it.

I called once to ask about why I got another "incorrect address" notification on one package and the woman there told me they don't do "same day deliveries" from FedEx out to residences.

That's a load of crap. When 2-day shipping turns into 3-day shipping, there's something they don't want to tell us that went wrong. I picked up the package from FedEx instead and what was written on the box was "can't find apartment."

If the drivers bothered to take a moment to LOOK at the labels on the DOORS, they would notice my apartment CLEARLY LABELED, but they didn't and instead deliveries turn into incompetent messes. I even once had someone post a "missed delivery" notice that said "incorrect address" ON THE FRONT DOOR OF MY APARTMENT.

How is it you can't deliver a package, but you can post a note on the door of an apartment that states you can't deliver a package when you could have just LEFT THE PACKAGE instead of a note saying you CAN'T?Completely stupid!<//Review>< GmapID>

I always ship packages UPS or FEDEX, but decided I should start utilizing USPS Media Mail to save money.  Wait was fast, and they were extremely helpful.  Plus, I saved over $90 in shipping costs!</text>

<text>Worst post office. Slow service, rude workers. Avoid at all cost. 1.5 hours to process one family of 5 for passports. I made a mistake on one form and was forced to wait another half hour when the family behind me had nothing filled out. Don't come for passports. One female worker said she hated it anyway.< /text>< gmapID>

The two people who process passports are rude. One of them was telling this elderly lady to wait in line, when in fact she was told to ask for a specific person. She was trying to explain this to him, but he just kept telling her to get in line.  He was finally told by another employee she was told to wait there. The other person who processes the passports was not even helping anyone on the passport list.  She kept helping other people in line for stamps and sending packages.  This system her is rediculous.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Before I lived in city of Westminster, the mailman always delivery packages in front my door and knocked door to let me know. They were friendly and more responsibilities even though my apartment was in the ending unit. I am not sure why Huntington Beach office is so different. I had urgent oversea parcel (with my phone # on top) with signature confirmation required but they just dropped a pink slip in the mail box ask me to pick up in the next day. I called the office a few times and finally did all the process with answer machine, since no real person respond. I required re-delivery to my door and ring the bell as they should do. I waited, waited, and waited, nothing happen. I went down stair and checked in the office, they just drop my parcel there. This time they did not even care my signature or not. I am new in Huntington Beach and I thought this city should be more professional but I guess I was wrong!</Review><pics>None</pics><username>Eagle Chen<//username><date>1461104723889</date><response>None< /response>< userid>

Thought I'd add my experience after moving out of HB.  Hopefully things have changed since I moved out.

First Irvine, they actually try to get through the line as fast as possible and the carrier never made delivery mistakes.

Next Fountain Valley, also significantly better than HB.  Always courteous and helpful.  Again, the carrier didn't make mistakes.

HB
I called late in the day, 4:45, and I was lucky enough to have some one pick up.  I was calling about a complaint, our carrier mixes up our mail every once and a while and I live in a 4 unit apartment complex.  I've never had this problem until I moved to Huntington Beach.  They informed me I had to call back tomorrow because everyone had left already.  I guess that's fine.  However, the person who picked up was very short with me and I thought I was being fairly courteous.  Ah...the postal service.  Service with a smile as always.< /Review>

Very sad. I am assuming these folks don't make a ton of money, but I am sure they have great benefits, a retirement plan, their work is as easy as pie, and the most difficult task asked of them is to sit in those training classes on how to "SLOW DOWN & ACT OVERWORKED". Even the postman that delivers my mail is angry and unhappy. I guess life was better for him in China. Right.<//text>

My experience was with supervisor Ernesto p. And of course he wouldn't give me his last name. He treats everyone like they r the scum of the earth. He acts like he owns the place. My opinion if your not happy with life don't take it out on everyone else it only makes you look immature.<//text>

I'd give ZERO if possible. Waits at the PO are interminable. But local delivery is even worse: frequent failure to deliver, frequent misdeliveries, my regular carrier is so unfriendly that it's rude and he is so blind to the customer that he has trampled across young growing plants.

The misdeliveries happen so regularly (and not just to me - I've found neighbors' bank statements on the sidewalk) that identity theft becomes much more likely since they've involved bank account statements, retirement account details, mortgage bills, phone bills. IRS letters, DMV info, medical communications - pretty much all anyone would need to invade your privacy, steal your identity, and empty your bank and investment accounts.

Despite many complaints over the years, management is either unwilling or unable to fix the chronic problems at this PO. I don't know if they are incompetent or unconcerned with the customer, but it doesn't matter. The bottom line is that the service provided by this PO is terrible.<//text>

I've lived in many states across the country and this is the single worst, most frustrating, inept group of postal workers and mail carriers on the planet. Congrats, you guys win. I was awaiting important medication to be delivered today. I was in my bedroom, adjacent to the front door, when I heard a car drive off. I looked out the window and it was the mailman. I ran out to the mailbox to grab the package but it wasn't there. Just a "sorry we missed you" slip with instructions to pick up at the post office the next day and an illegible scrawled tracking number. They didn't even ATTEMPT to deliver. No doorbell ring. No knock at the door. Nada.

Immediately tried to call post office. Can't reach a human.

Meanwhile, I waste my time redistributing mail to neighbors that is erroneously put in my mailbox DAILY. There are days we, the neighbors, meet up in driveways to trade all the misdelivered mail. It's insane.

If you want to experience sloth-like speed and having a conversation with a bowl of Jello, then visit the actual HB Warner location in person. Given the choice, I'd rather go to the DMV, or have a colonoscopy, any day over dealing with this post office.</Review></record></dataset><record>

My mailboxes are being replaced and we were told that we can pickup our mail from the Post Office. Knowing positively that I do have mail, especially a check, the incompetent fool there, said I didn't have any mail. These people are incompetent and just plain rude. Typical for blotted salaries as a federal government employee. If they were a private corporation, they would be out of business. This is the reason as to why they are loosing money and people have such a distain for the USPO and the Federal Government. CAN'T wait, when they are irrelevant as many of us are using emails, UPS, Fed. Express... ONE WORD, WORTHLESS third world country attitudes.</Text>

<review>Horrible service. I have a package stuck in my package mail box that has been there for four days because the key does not work. I've asked they remove the package and take it to my door 20 feet away, but instead they tell me the key does work and to try again when it still does not work! Completely incompetent. If they could get the key to work, they could take my package out and figure out the problem.<//review>< pictures>

This post office people are so stupid. That's all I can say.  They tried 2 times to wrong address with my certified mail and I got so mad because my son waited for 2 full days and nothing came and the tracking information keep saying they attempted 2 times and no one was there etc... so left the note..
However at time 3 people were at home and no one heard anything and no notes left.  It's already second time same thing happened and the management office said they often do make same mistake over again(confusing ours from other apartment complex).  I have no idea how they pass the post office exam.  Should be whole bunch of cheaters... such idiots they are!< /review>

Tried to call regarding mail pick up - our company has not had any mail picked up since Tuesday (it is now Monday).  By the time you cycle through the menu several times there is no point in continuing.  Just hopeless.</Text>

The worst post office I have ever seen . I have been losing all my mail and I complained to the manager name RAM and he doesn't care about the customer .
And finally I called the main post office and I made three complains about this office and it's the same nothing change.
I don't know who else I should ask him for help or who should I talk to about the this office .</text>

The guys who run this place are very nice & knowledgable. They listen to your concerns, diagnose, and inform you of what they think you should do. They break it down so you understand. Their prices seem reasonable compared to other places I've been. They're fast and keep you updated on when your vehicle will be ready and they'll work with you on payment. I don't know much about cars, but I always feel at ease when they work on mine. 6 stars for zero - runaround. No suggesting services you don't need for a price bump, like some other shops. They're honest and thorough.<//Text>

Just picked my Outback up and these service people were extremely nice. Got things done quick and washed my car. Felt welcomed not like a bother like other local Subaru dealerships.
No let's see how well the work was done< /Review>

I shopped around my area for different auto repair shops and most of them had no idea what was wrong with my car and I didn't have very much confidence in them, until I came across Hyperion Auto repair. They were quickly able to diagnose my car and explain my check engine light issue. They were professional and seem honest and reasonable with pricing. There was an issue with one of my coils being damaged during the repair, however the manager took care of it and did not charge me, which really made me feel like I could trust them. Very honest and friendly people. I am one satisfied and happy customer, great experience and service! This is the only place I will take my car from now on. You guys have gained a for life customer, I highly recommend these guys! Thank you again!<//Text>< pics>

I have been coming to Hyperion for 5 years now and never been let down.  Hyperion takes the time to talk you through what your car needs and shows you the work that has been done.  Having worked as a mechanic in the past I am comfortable with the service he and his crew provide.  If you own a Porsche, Audi, or BMW this is the place to take it.<//review>

This review is long overdue. I've never written one before but it's so hard for people to find Mechanics they can trust. I have been customer with Hyperion for over a decade and not only are they my favorite Mechanics, they are some of my favorite people on the planet. Gabby, Alex, Eddie and crew are, highly skilled, kind and most importantly, trustworthy.  They are like family and have always delivered top quality repair.<//Text>

<review>I sorta live in two places (San Francisco and San Rafael).  If my cars breaks down in San Rafael, I go to Firestone on Irwin (they are the best), but if I'm in the City, I go to Emerald.  I found out about them through the person who sold me their car.  They are the best!

I'm from NYC and I drive cross country, but when I'm here this is my auto shop. These folks are super helpful, considerate and affordable. They have always done a great job and will have my business while I'm here.</review>

Out of town friends had windows shattered from break in on Christmas Eve.  After several calls to mobile window repair companies, friend called me.  Knowing the make of her vehicle, I called Tommy here and confirmed that they are open until 6 pm.  She drove there, kids in tow, and he was able to remedy the problem and make the vehicle operational on her drive back home (several hours away).< /Review>

Smith is always willing to look at our car and give his honest opinion. He always assesses and let's us know what's going on. He's honest, fair, nice and friendly. We always go to him. Never met such an honest mechanic like him. If he doesn't have to do anything to your car - he won't make up something to charge you more. Great and reliable. I try to always call before I go to make sure they have enough time for my car.< /Review>

Also, their quote for an oil change for my Infiniti was $20 less than the competition, and they also did a visual inspection of the car, unprompted, while it was in the shop.  That inspection yielded a lot of very helpful comments along the lines of "hey, just thought you might want to know about X," and zero pressure to purchase or replace anything.< /Text>

Shouting from the rooftops I have finally found a car repair shop that I trust. Staff is very enthusiastic and knows what they are talking about. Came in with several different issues (in need of oil change, nail in tire, and a shaky motor) and they were incredibly helpful in each situation.</Review>

Found this STAR Smog Checker on Yelp. If your car is older than year 2000, just heads up that you'll have to make an appointment with them. However, it was easy to make one for next day at the time I wanted (they seemed very open to any time.< /text>

I was just there today because my tire pressure light came on... I called the day before and showed up at 11am for my appt time. I was in and out in about 30 minutes both with the diagnosis and the repair. I'm happy that they could get it done quickly in time for a weekend trip.< /text>

These guys are super friendly/honest and will always give you the best deals.

I was recommended to come here by my barber when I told him my car was making a weird noise. I went there afterwards and they told me my power steering fluid was low. They filled it up and let me go FOR FREE.

Ive been coming here ever since for their honesty and unbeatable prices. Last time I went to change my tires, they only replaced 2 and said to come back in a few months to replace the other 2 because they were only 75% worn out.</Review>

What can I say that hasn't been said.  This is a very good place.  It seems impossible to find an honest place and good prices but I swear this is the real deal.  Stacey (yes...it's a dude) he is great.  He'll talk you ear off but it's because he wants you to understand what is wrong with your car, why you need or don't need something done and why it costs what it costs!  I bring our cars there and hope he stays comfortably busy and in business for a long long time.</Review>

This shop has worked on my vehicles for 15 years. They are the BEST MECHANICS OF ALL TIME!!! I can not recommend enough. I strayed a few times and had the typical nightmare experience we all dread with car repairs. I learned my lesson. I will never stray again! Hyperion Auto is honest, fast, and they never try to upsell or push you into unnecessary repairs. Just straightforward quality work. Girls don’t have to be afraid here. Every customer is treated equally fair. Love, love, love them!< /review>

These guys are not just in the auto repair business, they are in the people business. I cannot express this better. It's like having a family doctor who knows you and your family and cares about you and your health. You and your friends are always welcome and will always get superb service.
Thank you Alex and Gabi and Edward and Nick and all.< /review>

<Text>Honest. Honest. And oh yeah, honest. These guys won't try to cheat you. They won't try to pump up your bill and charge you for unnecessary repairs. They quickly diagnose the issue and let you know what is wrong. This is the second car that I've taken to them for repairs, and they haven't let me down yet. My go-to guys for all auto repairs.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

We were on vacation.  It was our last day and the night before we were having radiator cooling issues.  I called Hyperion based on their reviews.  I called and explained my situation and they said bring it in.  I was in their shop 20 minutes later, that was 8:00am.   They had the problem diagnosed, ordered the part and had my car repaired and out the door by 11:00am...incredible.  We made the 6 hour trip back home without a problem.  These guys saved the day.  Finding a mechanic when you are traveling can be more than concerning.  All the customers that came and went while I was waiting for my car knew the owner by name and chatted as if they had known him awhile.  That made me feel even better.  I don't normally write reviews, good or bad, but I felt compelled due to my experience to write one this time.<//Review>

They recommended this place so we took a chance. They kept our car and told us the alternator we had bought was bad. They kept the car then early the next morning our car was ready to go. This place saved my mom Car the Noth of us being girls we felt everywhere we went they were trying to over charge.

<Review>I don't know what these guys did to my spouse's 2000 Toyota Corolla (well, actually, I do: new clutch and front brake calipers) but now it actually drives like a normal car for the first time in years. And at a very reasonable price. And done in one day. I used to be ashamed and afraid to drive this old clunker, but now I'm just ashamed. I'd recommend this place to anyone I like (people I hate, I tell them to take it to the dealers and spend all their money and then laugh when their car breaks down again).</Review>< pics>

My family has been bringing their cars to Alex and Gaby before Hyperion Auto Repair even existed. So, bringing my car for repair there is like taking it to a trusted family member.
I cannot recall any negative experience.< /review>

<text>Why there isn't a " Best Dentist Ever!!" sign on the outside of this office is a travesty! Dr. Scherer and his crew of wonderfully skilled peeps are the absolute best in the business!! Never have I been nervous or afraid of any treatment I have had with them. The atmosphere in the office is welcoming and warm, like you've known them all forever, like family. Highly skilled in all aspects of dentistry,  with all the latest and up to date methods. I highly recommend anyone to this office where you can trust and be comfortable with the care you'll receive.  I love this place! And I love my Dentist!!!< /text></record>

<review>I’m so happy with my smile after getting my braces off. It’s everything I was hoping for, and it’s all thanks to Dr. Shotell and her incredible staff. Dr. Shotell’s assistant Suzanne was especially a pleasure to be around and really went out of her way to make me as comfortable as possible during each and every visit. If you’re looking for orthodontic treatment, this is definitely the place to go! You’ll look forward to every appointment.< /review>< date>

I started out as a patient of Dr. Scherer after I recently moved to Sonora and had popped off a crown while flossing and needed someone ASAP that could fit me in!  Thankfully Dr. Scherer and his staff were able to fit me in right away! The whole experience was so awesome I decided to see him for my regular dental exams and cleanings.  After my first appointment Dr. Scherer mentioned they were offering free orthodontist consultations at the time.  It was actually something I had always thought about doing, so I decided to jump on it!  So glad I did.

I just finished almost a year of invisalign and couldn't be more in love with my teeth!  Having invisalign as an adult made me a little apprehensive but I could not have asked for a better experience and don't know why it took me so long to get started!  Dr. Shotell took such pride in the work she did for me and truly cared about giving me the absolute best results possible.  I also was able to experience the digital dental monitoring that Dr. Shotell does sometimes and as someone who moved away from Sonora shortly after I had started treatment, this was a life saver for me! I literally can not say enough great things about this dental practice!  Dr. Scherer and Dr. Shotell are not only great at their jobs but they are genuinely great people.  I feel lucky to have found them!</Review>

Have you ever walked in a house of someone who loves being a homemaker? That is what it is like walking in to this office.  The doctor's love what they do, and why they do it - so you see it in all the details! Here are five reasons for my five stars:

*The office is beautiful and welcoming and so professional and clean all at the same time.

*Both the doctor's really know what they are doing and you see it in their extensive education as well as their desire to share their knowledge in continuing education at colleges across the country.

*And the staff.....they are smart and kind, I feel like I have found new friends!

*My orthodontic treatment plan has been clear and concise.  I have had everything explained to me up front in an easy to understand perspective, and I have always been given the opportunity to to ask questions or get clarity when necessary.

*I love the attention to detail!  Just because something may be easier,  doesn't mean it will be done  - only the best options  are chosen, and it shows! I am looking forward to the finished product,  mostly because I think my teeth are looking great - but I know I will miss seeing everyone in the office consistently.< /text>

I have been going to Dr scherer for 2 and a half years. I came to him terrified and with major problems. He has calmed me and made me feel very important as a patient which is huge for me.  I walked out of the office with a new smile and feeling much better about myself. The whole office is very kind and willing to work around my crazy schedule. I have had absolute torture situations go on with other dentists so I came to them completely scared and they comforted me and have restored my faith in dentists. I would recommend them to any one. I love them and im very pleased to have found them♡ Jenny  horner<//Review>

Our daughter just got her braces off. She ended up with a perfect 10 smile in 18 months. Dr. Shotell is phenominal. She and her husband have the cleanest, most up to date office in the county! The office staff are friendly and very professional. By far the best Orthodontist ever!! Their office is state of the art. Dr. shotell uses all digital imaging- no gross alginate for her impressions. She made my daughter's retainers onsite in their lab. I can't say enough good things about this office!< /review>

< Review>
Some reviews are hard, but this one is easy. There aren't enough stars to do justice to a practice that excels in every way. I'm 71 yrs old an over my life I'm been a patient of some talented dentists but Dr. Scherer is in a class of his own. He'd be a huge success in NYC or L.A. or any major city. And the support staff is amazing truly empathic and friendly. I remember Siskel and Ebert and I'll say the same. Two thumbs up, way up.
Because of a med that I was taking I lost 5 or 6 teeth and both jawbones were infected. But the repairs are nearly complete now. I believe that good health requires good teeth. It's a mystery to me how Tuolumne County attracted a world class dentist. It's probably the lifestyle here and natural beauty of Sonora. There's Yosemite, the High Sierras, fishing, skiing and mountaineering plus the proximity to Cities like San Jose and San Francisco. That's what drew me when I moved here. I've never given ten stars because there's no 11. I'll give 5 stars, but I'd like to give 9 out of ten.

I came especially to the IDS conference in Germany to meet Michael and learn all about digital printing and 3D design of dentures
He is definitely one of the world's experts in this field and is so generous and willing to  impart information.
After spending over an hour with him I can safely say that if my own dad was living near to him, I wouldn't hesitate to refer him to Michael for implant or 3D printed dentures</text>

<Review>I just finished my orthodontic treatment with Dr. Shotell and Suzanne, (her amazing assistant) and I could not be happier!  I was on the fence about getting braces at my age, (over 50) but I was put at ease upon my first meeting with Dr. Shotell.  Having worked previously in Orthodontics, I knew what I was looking for in an Orthodontist and in the staff.  I found everything at Dr. Shotell's office!
Dr. Shotell is very knowledgeable, highly qualified, and up to date on the latest treatments to get the best results for her patients.  I highly recommend Dr. Shotell!</Review>< Name>

I feel so fortunate, or blessed, truly to have found Dr. Shotell right here in Tuolumne county!  I started looking into tray-based tooth alignment when I lived in Portland OR, and it seemed like the team I encountered there was using me as an experiment to see if they were capable of using the technology.  Completely different experience with Dr. Shotell!  It’s not just that she’s a scientist first and foremost, who keeps up on all the latest technology - she’s also supremely skilled with her hands, and she has the mind of an artist when it comes to dental aesthetics.  She has always taken the time to explain the processes to me in detail, and I’m so pleased with the results - I don’t have any self-consciousness about flashing my teeth when I smile anymore, and I can feel that my bite has been corrected to the extent that I don’t worry about erosion, marionette lines etc.  I always look forward to seeing Dr. Shotell and her incredible assistant Suzanne!  It’s wonderful to meet a team that is so professional and effective, yet with such great ‘bedside’ manner.  Their office staff are great too!  I highly recommend this practice; I dreamed of even teeth for so long and they made my dream come true and beyond!< /review>

After going thru 60+ years of dentistry I finally found the true Picasso of dental hygiene. I've had great dentists in the past but the service I received from Mike & his quality staff goes beyond my expectations. He employs a expert in partial replacement/repair & did a excellent job in restructuring my upper partial that now fits like a glove. Their cordial staff goes overboard in making your wait as comfortable as anyone can. You receive quality hot drinks at your request to pass the few moments while you wait. He uses the most updated technology & his x ray equipment is beyond belief. If you have "gag" issues like my wife has they have a machine that does a 360° scan where you never have any film loaded in your mouth! What a relief for my wife who nearly threw up from taking films in the past. All in all he's the most complete dental institution I've been to. Did I mention he's Dental Board Certified? Like a driver's license once you've completed your exam/drive test you get a license lol. So how many horrible drivers are on the roads? Board Certification means he's a approved dentist by the board of dentistry(he's the only dentist approved in the Sonora area) & you will see once you enter his office as to why. To end my review I just wish to thank Mike & his staff for a job well done. They told me my issues, made multiple recommendations & allowed me to choose my poison. You seldom find any dentist who LISTENS! Again thanks to Dr. Scherer & his staff for a job well done!< /text>

Thank goodness I found them!!!
I moved here 2yrs ago and worked for a dentist in my previous home . I had a different  dentist in this area tell me , on my first visit to them, I needed extensive work which I knew was untrue. I went to Dr Scherer had i was worried I'd have the same false info. But to my happy surprise-he is nice, very smart , incredibly talented at his work,  funny and HONEST!!! No work needed !

Hard to find an honest dentist so run to this one and stay!</text>

Everyone is very professional and caring.  I always feel welcome.  My health really depends on my being able to eat healthy foods and keep my teeth in the best shape I can, to do just that, eat!
I cannot say, "Thank You" enough, for all the service and care.  I never miss an appointment.  Everyone seems to really enjoy their work and have fun at it, I love the friendly environment!< /Review>

State of the art equipment but most impressive is his skill as a CLASS A dentist. His staff is quite efficient together with friendly personalities which eases the stress going to a dentist.< /Text>< Pics>

Dr. Scherer has not only the passion for dentistry, but a desire to employ the latest technology. I always feel like I receive the very best care available. He and all of the staff in his office are some of the nicest people I've met, too.< /Text>

<Text>[Update 082119] I did not know what I did not know about how confident you can be with straight teeth.  I did not expect that I would be this happy before staring the ortho treatment with Dr. Shotell.  I am on 1 aligner away from my last aligner and my teeth looked really great already... and Dr. Shotell is the true professional.  She took another record of my teeth today to MODIFY the treatment to make it even more perfect.  To me, my teeth already look so wonderful, and I dont know what can be done to make it look better than now.  For Dr. Shotell, 'good enough' does not exist in her dictionary.  She really wants to make sure that my teeth look beautiful and ready to be presented on a national TV show if it needs to.  I am going to post the picture if before and after once everything is done.  Very happy with the outcome.

If you hate going to dentists due to bad prior experiences, worry not.  This is the office that you trust and feel at home for all your dental treatments.  The office is sparkly clean, modern, and new.  Everyone in the office greets the patient with a big smile.  Not a fake smile but a genuine and sincere smile that you make you smile as well.  I am currently receiving an orthodontic treatment from this office.  It is ClearCorrect and I think they do offer Invisalign too.  Dr. Shotell is the only board-certified orthodontist in the area, and she is an amazing doctor.  My teeth are moving way faster (2 times faster at least, I think) than the normal treatments because Dr. Shotell used a special technique (Propel), in which I did not feel any pain at all.  In our appointments, she always makes sure that I am feeling comfortable.  And it is always comfortable enough that I fell a sleep multiple times during the treatment.  I do not feel like I am in the dental office at all!  I love my aligners and am already seeing the results of my teeth being straight with just 4th alighners!  Dr. Scherer is another doctor in this practice who does implants and etc.  Knowing that I once was a mechanical engineer, Dr. Scherer showed how computer aided design is being used in dental fields, and it's amazing!  It's like back-2-the-future scenes where everything is so advanced in the practice.  Dr. Scherer is a true expert in implants and dentures.  He's honest as well.  During the exam, he looked at my implants and the chipped crown and concluded that everything is looking good and did not proceed to change the crown. In his opinion, such change was not necessary.  I love it when I meet people who are honest and professional.  Lastly, they both seem to be pretty famous in dental fields as they teach other dentists worldwide.  These doctors are hidden gems, and everyone should pay a visit!<//Text>< pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Spent a lot of my 70 years in a dentist's chair.  Thought I'd seen it all.  In walks Dr. Michael Scherer, new ball game.  No brag, just fact, this man is the real deal.  Look up smart in the dictionary and you'll see his picture.  I can not believe we have him in Sonora.  Tell no one, or SF, LA or NYC will steal him.  Latest and greatest....be prepared to be amazed.  Computer fit and finish.  It is not overstated to say this man, this office, can give you your life back.  When we were young, eating with good strong teeth and  our smile, we took it for granted. At 70 you've worn out two sets of teeth, now mashed potatoes and pudding.  Enter Dr. Scherer.  Life begins again, MAGIC.  Run, don't walk to this artist's workshop in Sonora.< /review>< pictures>

Dr. Scherer and Dr Shotell are very professional and yet have a warm and inviting manner that  makes you feel at home in their office. Very qualified and up to date on all services one might want or need. They handle the insurance billing so there's no need for intervention on my part. Over all as good an experience one can expect for dental services. Good Job! Bob Parriott< /Text>

<text>My first visits were good . I had 2 bridges made by Dr. Scherer, in which turned out beautiful. My lower front bridge was finished Jan. 2017 on May 19th 2019 my lower bridge came out. I called to get an appointment on  Monday May 20th at 8:00 am they said I could not get in until May 22nd at 4:00. In the mean time take it out to sleep and eat. That to me is long time. I ended up going to a different dentist to re-cement it(on May 20th,2019 at 10:30am)<//text><gmapID>0x8090cf7212114f8b:0xcfb37fd6844c66d1</gmapID>< user_id>

Dr. Sherer's office has not disappointed me yet. I love my new hygienist, Sarah, who had read the notes in my file as to particular instructions to protect my veneers and crowns while giving me an ultra-clean mouth. Thank you all!</Text>

The front desk staff and dental techs are all very friendly. Dr. Scherer is smart and funny and committed to getting you to LIKE going to see him! As an older person, I so appreciate his handle on and enthusiasm for new technology. For a crown prep to take a half hour vs. 2 hours is innovation indeed!< /Text>

Dr. Melissa D. Shotell is a wonderful orthodontist. We appreciate her professional manner as well as her personal attention and friendship. Dr. Shotell is very knowledgeable and proficient with technology, using the latest hi tech equipment. She pays great attention to detail. As the “Mom,” I appreciate the extra time she has spent explaining the process, while straightening my daughter’s teeth. I have rarely been as confident with any Dentist as Dr. Shotell. Their rates are very reasonable, more than competitive with easy financing. We enjoy each and every visit since she has the FRIENDLIEST staff ever!<//review>

I am beyond grateful to have found this dental office! Dr. Shotell and the staff are some of the most genuine people. Walking into the office, you're greeted with big smiles and by name! I was turned away by 3 other orthodontist offices due to the severity of my case. Without Dr. Shotell and the office willingly taking my case, I wouldn't have my braces! So many thanks to the office! ❤<//review>

Going to the dentist is a fact of life so finding that one dentist that always makes you feel safe and comfortable is important.  That is what I have found at Dr. Michael Scherer's office.  Every appointment with him has been  a positive experience .  Dr. Scherer is a dentist with very high standards.  His staff are always kind and considerate.
I consider myself fortunate to have found a dental office that I am happy to walk into.

I had always dreaded going to the dentist, even for a cleaning - bad childhood dental traumas, if you are over 50, you probably had them too.
Yesterday I went in for my regular cleaning.  I chatted with the great staff; met Holly, saw Jessica's latest picture of the adorable guy, followed Joelyn back for my cleaning, chatting the whole way. My cleanings are now something I actually look forward to, WOW, never - ever - thought I would be saying that! My teeth are in the best shape they have been in since the 80's. The office is clean, up-to-date, the staff friendly and professional.  Recommend< /Text>

I have known Dr. Shotell for several years. She was the practicing dentist at my very first dental hygiene job. I actually got the pleasure to work along side her and experience the dental world from a different point of view. She is a great teacher and very precise in her work. Dr. Shotell always made sure to explain any procedures and made me feel confident when I was working next to her. To have a doctor like her you know you will be in great hands.</Review>

I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Scherer, the dental hygienists, and front desk people. They have all been friendly, professional, and accommodating. The two dental hygienists that have cleaned my teeth over the years are the best dental hygienists I have had work on my teeth. They were both through, polite, and great at communicating what it is they were doing or needed me to do. Dr. Scherer did a great job on the few fillings I have had, he's very professional, great at communicating, and patient. The front desk ladies are always so nice to converse with and help to make the trip to the dentist/hygienist a smooth and pleasant one.< /Review>

Dr. Scherer is by far the best dentist that I've ever had, with qualifications that amaze me.  His office staff is professional and friendly with an upbeat manner that put me at ease right away.  The initial exam was extremely thorough and subsequent dental work was surprisingly painless.  I find myself looking forward to my next dental visit and believe me, that's never happened before.  My gums are healthy again and I'm very grateful to be a patient here.  Thank you, Dr. Scherer!<//Text>

Dr. Scherer and his staff are professional, efficient and friendly (and I've never had to wait past my appointment time).  I had Angie clean my teeth for the first time, and she was great...just as Jolie has always been.
Thanks for keeping my teeth healthy,

AH ! what a relief to find dentist that really care for your health and facial looks.
As my search for implant docs  revealed, there is a difference among them...
Caring, down to earth, professional yet very friendly and authentic, staff filled with young and friendly ladies, these folks  taken the concern of a
skeptic to the realm of a comfortable and fearless patient.

Thank you ! Doc. Scherer

I am  just starting my dental journey with Dr. Scherer but so far am very happy with his friendly, relaxed style of communication.  I thought that he would be stuffy and arrogant but instead he is funny and kind and besides he likes dogs !   His office is full of lovely, equally competent young Ladies who make you feel welcome  and well cared for.  I had some baggage after a string of unpleasant  dental experiences over the years so it took some skillfull encouragement by the office staff just to get me in the door !  Now that I have met them and Dr. Scherer I am encouraged  and have hope that in the future I will never have to search for a Dentist again or avoid care due to fear.</Review>

I would like to thank Michael D. Scherer and all the girls in the  Offices
I came in and I was so full of fear , I have never had a good DDS time and always a lot of pain. It was at the point my teeth needed to be removed and  complete dentures. Michael D. Scherer and the all the girls in the office work me to help me not to feel so fearful and not to have a anxiety  over being at the DDS, They all told me what was been done and how it was going to work. Now for the first time in my life I can walk into a DDS office  and feel happy. They have give me back my life all my bad teeth are gone , and my new teeth look great and I love them.
I just wish to thank them all for given back my life ,  If you have great fear of the DDS I'm going to tell you hear is a place that can help you get thought what work you need to have done, They work with your fear to feel good.
Thank you for giving me back my life  and feel just great again, Nara</Review>

I am a New Patient of Dr. Michael Scherer, who is also new to Sonora. He donated a new patient exam, cleaning and Sonicare to a Soroptimist Groveland Fundraiser, and I bid on it and won (bought)  it.
Today I had my new patient exam. I have always hated going to the dentist, but Dr.Mike and Karen, the hygienist, as well as all the office staff were so friendly and did everything possible to make me feel welcome and comfortable.
I had the most thorough exam I have ever had, including X-rays, photos, measurements, smiles, jaw exam, and more. Thankfully no major problems were found, and I didn't feel at all like the recommendations were being made just for the dentist to make more money, which is what I have experienced before.<//Text>

It is hard to express what this entire office has done for my family. I am beyond grateful for all that they have given us. Dr. Scherer began helping my daughter whom  has a rare medical condition that has caused her to lose her teeth on the right side. He gave so much of his time and heart to making her the perfect retainer that not only helped with her being able to eat and chew evenly on both sides, but he helped with her self confidence too and now she smiles like never before. Dr. Shotell has also been very valuable and supportive for my other daughter when it was time to start looking at getting braces. My daughter struggled with this process and was very resistant. The patience, care, compassion, and knowledge that Dr. Shotell gave to her and I, was priceless. We are now almost ready to get the braces off! Both experiences were hard, but it was made much easier having both Dr. Scherer and Dr. Shotell caring for my girls. The entire office is so friendly  and really care about us, as well. I can't believe we have this type of knowledge and care in our small town.</text>

To truly describe this dentist/ doctor would take sometime .

So let me sum this up for anyone searching  for the best of the best !

The first meeting with Dr Scherer I knew this man was more then a absolute perfectionist in his skills , he is a artist pertaining to individual human facial structure, dentistry , and he is by far one of the kindest human beingsI
have ever met .. The honor was mine ...🎐 remains mine. 🌼🌼🌼

The old story  remains like many women ?

I'm a 56 Native American woman , all these years as we wife's and mothers sometimes do .. I placed every family member ahead of myself .

So the day just several months ago came when my day arrived . Every appt with Dr and staff was like family .

So after this mold and that' Dr Scherer working his brilliance .. 😆
I walked out over a month ago with the first smile in YEARS ...

😂😃.. I traveled 2.5 hours to receive his services one way , and would do it all again.

If $ is your reservation , find a way . Nothing feels better then to be able to truly smile 😁😂😃😄

Teeth just a showing ..

On a personal note , when I walked out the door and got into the car with my sweetheart husband I just cried ? Many reasons ...the kind ness show me by each staff member (Jessica) and co workers to the fact that Dr Scherer made me feel like and he meant it 🎐🎐 that I was the most important patient of the day ..

So Dr Scheere .....God bless you and the gift given you ..

Just smile as Tony  Bennett would sing to us lol 🎐. 🎐. 🎐

Dr Schere ,..I repeat is the best of the best ..

And there comes a time in life that we as human beings become the best if the best

Forever grateful to you Dr and staff
Blessings in all you do

Thank you will never mean enough ..
Respectfully with gratitude 🎈🎈🎈

<text>I worked alongside Dr.Shotell for a few years as one of her assistants. She is one of the greatest dentists I have worked for and I would highly recommend her. Dr. Shotell makes sure her patients are well informed about procedures and has the patience to answer any/all questions that they may have. Dr. Shotell also takes her time and puts her best effort into all of her dental work. I really liked working with Dr. Shotell also because of her very upbeat and positive attitude. I have confidence that any patient of Dr. Shotell is a happy patient!</text><username>Airika Beardsley< /username><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

It's a privilege to have Dr Scherer as my dentist. He really shows he cares about his patients' dental care and is extremely personable, postive, hard working, and delivers incredibly high quality care. He's made a commitment to investing money into technology to ultimately enhance the quality of care his patients recieve (while being able to streamline many of the processes when compared with traditional old school dentistry).

Dr Scherer spends a lot of his own time reviewing cutting edge technology to ensure his patients always have modern dental procedures available to them. This means that the Sonora area has and top dentist/prosthodondist available who is capable of making his patients feel that they are cared about with an equal measure of compassion and a great sense of humor. I was a walk-in last year and, not knowing Dentist A from Dentist B in the area, I'm very happy I decided to walk through his door.< /text>

I am convinced Dr. Scherer is the best dentist in the whole world. He also has a fantastic staff that is incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. If you want it done right, then you have to see Dr. Scherer and company. Extremely knowledgeable and friendly beyond words. I had no idea what to expect when I had my remaining upper teeth removed and a dental implant called "All on 4" put there in place. I had heard good thing about having the procedure done by Dr. Scherer but there is always the possibility that something will go wrong. I am happy to say everything went great! To such a degree that at this point, I have to seriously consider an "All on 4" on my lower teeth. The incredible bite force and maintenance free operation of my upper implant is a "Win, Win Situation".  The cost of doing implants one by one and that they are not all connected together like they are on an "All on 4", is one of the reasons I decided to have Dr. Scherer do the procedure. Also, all the work is done on one fateful day. I highly recommend that you spend the extra effort to get set up with Dr.Scherer. Call and speak to Jessica or Holly in the front office. Jo Lee is their insanely fantastic higenist. And also honorable mention to Dr. Slim Bouchoucha, an unbelievably great oral surgeon, is in order. Together they are symphony of excellence.< /review>

Very nice Ross, store was clean, organized, and not too crowded. Friendly associates was greeted by multiple associates, there wasn't too much of a line ( probably because it wasn't too crowded). Was able to find a few items I needed for my household.< /text>

people are constantly stealing without any consequences and it feels unsafe to shop when there is a severe lack of security. Especially when rowdy and aggressive customers are starting to shop here regularly. EDIT: It also has a very sour odor when you go to the areas toward the back of the store.< /Text>

I enjoyed shopping this morning, all safety protocols are in place. Sanitizer available, contactless payments. The store was super clean nothing out of place. Restrooms are not available still. My only concern while having a 3 year old so it cuts shopping to a minimal.

Staff is pleasant,  very bright in store so.many this to choose from.< /review>

<Text>My wife and I went to get tested for covid-19. The video consultation was quick and friendly. They were able to get us in the very next morning. The staff was pleasant, efficient and prompt. We were the 23rd vehicle in line(most vehicles had multiple people inside) and we were tested in under an hour. We also received our results in approximately 2 hours (both negative). All in all the experience was much better than we expected it to be.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

It is my first time to write a review on Google because of a VERY RUDE operator. I called them for getting to know more about my insurance coverage, and the operator was so impatient, rude, apathetic. I would never go there, no matter how good it looks on Google reviews!!</text>

It would have been quick to get a covid test and when they finally were able to get to us, the test itself was quick and easy.   The NP that took care of us was pleasant and explained the procedure well.  We ended up having to wait about 30 minutes because the car before us had some issues and a child that was uncooperative (not the tester’s fault).   Overall a good experience.</review>

<text>I had an appointment for a COVID test listed at between 11 - 12. I got to the Urgent Care at 11:05 and there was one car ahead of me waiting. No sign of Urgent Care staff or a note saying they were running late. It was at 11:45 when we were checked in and then waited another 15 minutes. When they came out to test us it was over in a flash. A little more communication would have been appreciated.
However, I’m very happy to get my test. They are still hard to come by.</text><gmap_id>0x808fcb874c008c23:0x86291a6c21e5e4ea</gmap_id></record>

Drive up Covid-19 testing. There were A LOT of people doing it so there were MANY MANY cars lined up. The process was smooth and fairly quick all things considered. The test itself only took about a minute (if that). The staff did a great job.< /review>

IUC gave me a wrong COVID test for travel on 5/8.  We called non-stop for an hour with no answer, I had to rush to San Jose Airport for testing again, they charged $170 (vs. $238), result by 2pm the next day with a copy of CLIA cert.  I posted my review and got a call saying that he is so sorry, that he will refund my charges.  I told him that I already took another test, please refund me and call my sister who hasn’t gotten a new test yet.  He called back 3 hours later, claiming that the test was the right one, they just messed up the paperwork.  So he “fixed” the paperwork to indicated PCR was done, (but the CLIA number on the report was not correct).  Then he refused my refund claiming that the test and paperwork were correct.  I have already disputed with my credit card.  Anyone needing a PCR test for overseas travel please google COVID test San Jose airport.  They are cheaper, they know what they are doing, totally professional!  If you read the reviews, this is not the first time they have given antigen test instead of PCR!

I needed a RT-PCR COVID test for travel, this was communicated during telemedicine with a doctor.  The wording for test result provided only said “RAPID SARS COV 2 AG, QL IA...”. No mention of RT-PCR, NAAT, or RNA, keywords accepted by the airline.  At this point, the airline is rejecting the test result.  We tried to called the office to get help, but there’s no answer.  I need the test for traveling on Monday.  This is totally unacceptable, I would like to give 0 star, but that’s not an option.<//review>

<Review>They have you make a set appointment then send you an email telling you to show up within an hour window of that time. I was second car in line. I waited 15 min. Before anyone checked me in, then they verified my ID. Then waited another 25 min. For someone to come out. It was like they got 10 cars parked before they came out and tested anyone. I’ve had several covid test because I am a essential worker, this is the first time they stuck the Q-tip up my nose and twisted it into the membrane over and over and over again in both nostrils. It hurt like hell. When I’ve had it done before they just swab around the inside of the nostril did not hurt or bring tears to my eyes like this one. I would not recommend “Urgent Test Care” for your rapid Covid test.</Review>< userid>

This was a relatively painless process to get a rapid test. First was an online screening with a doctor which went very well. The test itself was very quick with very little wait time. I highly recommend this process< /Review>

Went here for my COVID19 test. Got appointment for video visit within 20 mins and then appointment for test on very next day. Testing was streamlined and you don't need to leave your car making whole process safe and prevents exposure. Overall big thumbs up.< /Review>

Had a really good experience with a very nice nurse name “Zakari.” There was a wait but it is San Jose. Regardless you’re gonna be waiting for a while. Would recommend for people trying to get tested!< /Review>

<text>Took a rapid covid test. The virtual visit provider joined 40 minutes later than our scheduled time. For the rapid test, had to wait in drive thru line for 1 hour. One parking attendant and one professional for taking swabs were catering to all the cars. I understand this is peak covid time, but adding more staff would definitely help move things faster.

They did call me in 4 hours to let me know my result. I appreciate it.< /text>< rate>

<text>The PA who did my telemedicine visit was curt and did not want me to have a rapid test. She finally agreed to it and said I would be sent a appointment notice within a few minutes. Never happened, I had to schedule another telemedicine appointment and after sending two messages through the portal someone call and reprimanded me for making an additional appointment. She said the system programmed my phone number in wrong and that’s why I didn’t get the appointment for the rapid test. I finally got one today. While in my car I noticed that the staff performing the tests don’t change their gloves between patients. This seems like a great way to spread Covid. Still waiting for the results.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><date>1610153463092<//date></record></dataset><record>

<text>Instant Urgent Care is not a trustworthy place.
I took the test on 12/22/20 and they did not send me my result in writing, they just told me that it was positive and I did not receive my test.  I already sent them emails and texts and I have not received anything yet.  I did another test on 12/24/20 and it came out negative. now I don't know if I was positive or not</text>< pictures>

<Text>Well organized fast intake. Still slow in delivery of covid 19 tests. Up to 5 days or more. While that is not really their fault as I do not believe they are running the test themselves but rather sending it out to the big labs to do it. Fact check me on this

We need to get the 15 minute check out to the public. I do not look forward to days of not knowing.<//Text><Rating>4< /Rating><user_id>116916274147235539175<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x808fcb874c008c23:0x86291a6c21e5e4ea< /Gmap_id>< time>

<Review>Lining up on the busy street with cars expecting to drive in the lane I was stopped in waiting for COVID was extremely dangerous. I was waiting for a car to plough into the back of my car. It was a terrible location- no room to wait safely or park easily and only two individuals testing. It took forever.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808fcb874c008c23:0x86291a6c21e5e4ea< /gmap_id>< username>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>We need to do Covid-19 PCR tests for travel and had to meet doctors through telemedicine for each family member separately. However, the doctor made a mistake and ordered rapid test for one of us. We found it out after receiving an appointment confirmation text. We called them immediately for correction. They said it was changed to PCR.

Today we went there on time. There was a long line: only one technician was talking samples. The parking lot was tiny, making it even slower. We had to wait for over 2 hours. When the technician came to us, we found one of our family members was still rapid test. They didn't make correction when we called two weeks ago. They cannot make corrections today. The rapid test is not acceptable for the destination we will travel.

I would avoid using Instant Urgent Care by all means.</text>< gmap_id>

Urgent Care took excellent care of me from start to finish. My own Dr. was having trouble fitting me in. Urgent Care did a video consultation on Friday and I was tested for exposure to CV 19 the next day. The staff was wonderful, friendly and professional. They also accepted my PPO health insurance. Highly recommend, they are open weekend's too.< /Review>

This Urgent care provided fake information to the patent. I have never had appointment or care provided on 12/8/2020. But my medical record from Urgent care shows that they provided me telemedicine care on this day. And they referred me take Amoxillin 500mg and Ibuprofen while i have no sickness symptoms.
They are doing their jobs so wrong< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I came here for covid testing 10/21/20, not very busy at 2pm. The woman who did my covid nasal swab was super sweet and super gentle. I’ve been terrified to get tested but it was nothing like I thought it would be. She talked me through everything and had me do breathing exercises during the swab which honestly helped a lot. I wish I knew her name, but I can’t thank her enough for making my experience a good one!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Had an online appointment within 2 hours of calling with a great kind Dr Matt. Referred me next day to their office drive in and stayed in my car. Took about 40 minutes wait I did not mind at all. Felt so badly for the women doing the testing in the upper 80’s in their PPE sweating. Test really quick. Thank you all so much for the great customer service, and special thanks for the first responders.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Awesome service and the people were so kind. However, it was very disorganized and no sense of a line whatsoever. Luckily I got there before the rush so I was helped quickly, but when I left there was a huge line blocking the street when there were tons of open spots to park so people could be tested. Very poor signage and a very noticeable lack of organization. However still a good experience for me and I am very thankful to the people doing this work. However, management needs to be doing a better job.</Review>< Pics>

<Response>None< /Response><name>Amelia Kusar<//name><text>Highly recommend for COVID testing!! You have to have a video conference with a doctor before you can schedule a COVID test, but there were same day video appointments available, and the call was about 5-7 mins. I needed a rapid test done within the next two days (I completely dropped the ball on scheduling one earlier, so was panicking a little!) The doc was able to get me an appointment for a test the next day in Santa Clara (about 40 mins from me, since the closer clinic was closed on the weekends. But hey, I was fine to drive a little extra if they could get me in on such short notice!). Once the doc ordered the test, I was sent a 2 hour window in which to show up to the clinic for my test. I highly recommend getting there as early as possible in your window (maybe even a little earlier!). The way that the staff handled the drive-up testing was extremely organized and efficient, and everyone was very kind! JUST BE PREPARED TO: 1) wait in a line of cars for a bit, as they move folks into parking spots as earlier cars leave; and 2) wait a little bit more once you are parked (bring some work tO do!) I was in and out in exactly 1 hour, which I will absolutely not complain about. The line looked a little longer as I was leaving, so I imagine the Alesia could be potentially longer than that. But hey, it was nothing compared to some of the nightmare waits I know others have experienced. THANK YOU SO MUCH, INSTANT UC!!!</text><user>110972167194822026749<//user>< Gmap_id>

The site where I was tested was a small center but the staff there arranged the incoming and outgoing traffic very well and my wait for the test was shorter than I expected.  I would have given IUC five stars if my experience getting registered for the test hadn't been so darn tedious and getting in touch with anyone to assist you with that hadn't been difficult also.<//Text>

I like the services they offer at instant urgent care. They offer you simple lab exams in the office, to better solve minor health problems you might have at the appointment. The facilities are clean, organized and well equipped. My primary care is within the group and I really like her job. She's knowledgeable, courteous, attentive to details and she really listens and offer advice to patients.<//review>

I had a noon appointment and arrived around 1120am. The website didn't mention the testing would be done outside. It did mention over the phone after I had made the appointment to see a doctor via web but I couldn't access that at home. Once I arrived I was greeted and all my information was taking and I was told to downloaded the app to be seen prior to testing. I waited in my car for a provider to speak with me for almost half an hour. I had things to do and unfortunately the testing wasn't going to begin until 1pm. I stayed on the app GG or another 30 minutes after leaving their parking lot. So I was never seen via the app. I was called a little after 1pm to get me with a provider, but I had an appointment I couldn't miss. I had them cancel my appointment. Maybe I a I shouldn't go around lunch time. I will go to the free pop up testing sites tomorrow.< /review>

If you need testing done for Covid -19 please go else where. My husband and myself were promised test results in 4 days. It’s been almost two weeks and still no results or phone call. We have called and emailed and no one has gotten back to either of us. The most irritating thing is that the doctor told us that the testing is free, but we received a rather large bill in the mail. It’s pretty convenient that they can get the bill out faster than our results.. Very disappointed with our experience, do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time.< /text>

<Review>Covid-19 - went to website and scheduled a quick telemedicine session which allowed me to then come in the next (or same) day and get a test. It seems cumbersome but it speeds things up when you ge there. Had to wait a bit but the staff are very nice and understanding. Definitely worth it.<//Review></record>

Online Reservation and Payment System is totally broken.

The intake process is super confusing, slow and broken.

Go somewhere else!<//review>

<Review>I had the best experience! First of all, I had no trouble setting up a same-day telemedicine call and the physician was phenomenal. Receiving my covid test at the drive-through, the staff were extremely kind, professional and thoughtful. Highly suggest getting a covid test with instant urgent care.<//Review>< Rating>

This Covid deal is no joke but the staff was cool and got me in and out in 10 mins for my antibody test. 10/10 and these women deserve a raise, a high five, and a beer!!!!</text>

First time visitor to this clinic and the service was exceptional. I called prior and the front desk was very helpful in answering my health insurance questions. Dr. Stanley Ma, was quick to diagnose my health issues, which turned out to be a severe sinus infection along with asthma related symptoms.  Prescriptions were called in and filled promptly. I was able to pick those up and take the antibiotocs immediately to alleviate the symptoms. All in all, I definitely highly recommend this clinic.<//review>

<text>13 DAYS ago, I was tested here for COVID-19 and I still don't have my results back. I have called every phone number I can find, trying multiple options and leaving voicemails. I have sent a message in the online Athena Health portal. I check that portal every day, multiple times per day. No one has returned any of my calls or messages.

Bunch of incompetent doctors... they can’t treat even common cold. My entire family fell sick. Please don’t go to this place. I have been there thrice all three times they didn’t treat well. I ended up going to other doctors. There is no option to give 0 rating. Please consider rating as 1 minus 1.<//review>

<Text>The last thing I want to do is to complain about front line workers and this is not a complain about the worker just how disorganized their system is. No one answers calls and no way of emailing anyone. I was supposed to get my Covid-19 test result in 3 days and I’m on the 8th days and no result.
Nurse got back to me on wed that they’re doing the last test and I should have the result the next day. I’m still waiting. If you need to get your result in a timely manner I suggest you go somewhere else and save yourself from the headache of chasing them. The lab that they work with is the problem.

Update: today is the 8th days and still no response and no one is updating me on my result. I'm sure it does not matter bc they charge my insurance anyhow.</Text>< pictures>

The lobby wasn’t the cleanest, maybe because it was the long weekend!  Staff were polite. I was taken in about 15 mins after my appointment time. The doctor on duty was friendly. Suggested I do a related test at their other location. Overall a reasonably good experience. Will know better once my problem gets resolved.<//text>

<Text>This time was different with a different provider. They wanted to do a rapid flu even though I had zero symptoms other than a stuffy nose. I felt I was an attempt to add a test because the girl at the front desk had told me IF a test is needed it would be an extra 59.00. Then all the sudden I need another test. I said no thank you. It is not the flu. It is a sinus infection. Smh. The provider got mad apparently because she slammed the door as she left. If I have to see that provider again I will not return. Unprofessional. Otherwise they are great.</Text>< user_name>

Great staff, very helpful, knowledgeable, caring, relatively quick and great bedside manner. I have come here twice now for X-rays regarding possibly broken bones. The first visit we tested the area and it looked pretty bad so we took an X-ray. The second time, the Doctor (Charlie?) tested the area and it didn't really look like I needed one, so I went home with some good advice on how to take care of it and recover. I am happy to avoid expenses and radiation if I can help it!
And his advice was just what I needed. On the mend, no problems.

I am a fairly active guy, and between motorcycling and martial arts I am sure I will be visiting Beacon again at some point down the road.<//Text>

<Text>The doctor here should be embarrassed of her work. All my wife and I needed was for her to perform a physical and sign off on a bill of health for our adoption process. My wife and I had to come back twice each (to different locations) for no reason other than to be billed.  We were also billed out of pocket for the initial visit because “they didn’t take insurance for a physical”. Only to find out after we paid cash they they absolutely do take insurance. There was nothing that could not have been done over the phone (outside the physical). Never coming back here again. I wish I had gone elsewhere.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Staffs and Dr are very kind. I'm so glad to find this place.

My son injured from skateboarding today (Sunday afternoon). Some reason my son's health insurance will start back tomorrow, however we don't want to go Vally hopital even we have insurance because it will be long waiting time.
We googled and found some urgent centers.
First we went Active urgent, Hamilton Ave around West gate shopping center. They told us it will cost minimum $200 to check in, it will cost total $400 to stitch my son's chin.
It wasn't bad to compare to gong emergency.
My son wanted to check other place and we came to "Beacon". First of all, we really felt that staffs were so kind. It wasn't long waiting and cost was very reasonable, we also saved $$.
All Staffs are so friendly. Thank you for working on Sunday.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Went in today for back pain. Made an appointment online for about 2 hours later. Got there before my appointment time and was helped as soon as I walked in. The doctor, the nurse & the front office lady were great. Walked out of there in a short amount of time with the necessary prescriptions. Very quick. Thank you for your professionalism.<//text>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>Coming here was a waste of time. I came straight here after a car accident, was quickly taken by very nice staff. The doctor that saw me did none of the tests that should be done to someone who had just been in a wreck—no concussion examination, no X-ray, no real recommendation for an X-ray or treatment. Save yourself some time and go straight to the emergency room. I gave it three starts for pleasant staff and clean facilities.< /review>< pictures>

Top notch care and exceptionally clean facility! I called beforehand for a same day appointment. When I arrived I quickly filled out only 2 pages for their information. Doctor was very knowledgeable, efficient and friendly. If I need medical care again (I was visiting from Southern California) I will definitely return here.</text>

I showed up late almost 7 o'clock they took me in and took care of the paperwork and short order at  Front desk.  I can't remember the receptionist /medical tech name but very  Friendly rifled through the forms chit chatted about KD of the Warriors going down  Shes a real multitasker.
The nurse took care of the preliminaries weight hieght and blood pressure and pulse   professionally and made me feel at ease.
Oh then Dr Dalizue came in and diagnosed like Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. .
All in all if I was the boss on undercover boss .They all would be going to Hawaii for a month long vacation.<//Text>

<text>This place used to be Beacon Urgent care and it seems Instant Urgent care has taken over. Beacon Urgent care used to be such a great place but I visited Instant Urgent care first time few days back and experience was really bad. Pathetic, everything. For example: Beacon used to have X-ray there but these guys dont have and so they asked to get X-Ray done outside. I did that next day one place outside and they sent the report to Instant Urgent care. When I called to check if they received the report and if doctor has seen it, they asked us to visit (and pay office visit) to find out what doctor has to say. Seriously? That explained to me why they dont keep XRay machine there. When I asked this to the front desk, she was just rude. I will never go back to this place again.<//text><user_name>Rajesh S</user_name>< Gmap_id>

I came in with nausea and vomiting on a Tuesday afternoon. There were 2 people ahead of me and although I threw up several times in the lobby I had to wait almost 2 hours to be seen. The MA and PA were great! They were very friendly and knowledgeable but ended up sending me to the ER due to severe dehydration, they did not give me IV fluids there which was surprising because they have before. Instead I received medication for nausea and a cup of water.
The front desk staff and medical team are good but the wait was horrible, I should have just gone straight to the emergency room :-(</Text>

Professional, clean, quick, personable.  Got results of bloodwork back the same day and they called me, pronto, to discuss.</review><pics>None< /pics>< name>

I fell off my bike and went to see if I needed to get stitches. I arrived a few minutes before they closed but they were still kind enough to see me and were very friendly. Turns out I did need stitches and they did a great job patching me up. They had to stay much later than the closing time and I am very thankful that they did. Dr. Blackshear and Joshua Ebarb (hope I got their names right) were great. I hope you don't have to go to Urgent Care, but if you do, I recommend this place.< /Text>

I was sent there by my chiropractor to have an x-ray of my back only person in the whole place waited period of time X-ray Tech Cathy Tran takes me back to the X-ray room as I'm standing there in front of x-ray machine in a gownd getting x-rays be taken asks me to signing paperwork. Which didn't have a problem signing it but why wasn't I given this ahead of time  with all the other papers. Very unprofessional . when I brought that to her attention she got very upset and left the room and then left me sitting there for about 15 minutes and when she came back wanted to argue and debate with me regarding her attitude I will never go back to this</Text>

<Review>Appointment means nothing! It took ~ 40 mins to get back to the room to be seen. Entire apt took over 2.5hrs to be given Gatorade, despite patient being pregnant and as such should have been a priority. The PA who saw us  was not knowledgeable and had a terrible bed side manner. The medical assistant was the most helpful and seemed more informed than the PA. Will never be back here again. If it was an option would have not given any star.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>They were covered by my insurance.  Got some labs done.  Many things went wrong.

1.  Doctor didn't use gloves when drawing blood.
2.  Doctor didn't believe me when I said my veins move.
3.  Doctor proceeded to stick and needle and dig around in my right arm, trying to find the vein. Ow.
4.  Couldn't find the vein in the right arm, period.
5.  Doctor proceeded to stick and needle the left arm.  Ow, again.
6.  Doctor referred to a piece of medical equipment as a "thingie".
7.  When the blood results came back, they called my emergency contacts without telling me first.  As a result, I got a panicked call from my parents for pretty much no reason.
8.  I had gone in for a stomach issue with cramps.  The doctor's first diagnosis was appendicitis.  I think it was actually indigestion and stomachache and my time of the month.
9.  Who knows when the urine results will come back.

Would not recommend.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Today I cleaned my cabinet. I saw the health report I received about three years ago from Beacon Urgent Care.
In April 2014, I went to Beacon Urgent Care to check my health. The doctor, Monica Ball, checked my vision. She shouted out to me loudly several times in front of other employees and patients: “You are blind! Your vision is too bad!”
I said to her: “I am not blind. I can see the sign of Beacon Urgent Care without glasses.”
She shouted out anxiously to me again in front of all other people: “You ARE blind! The sign is so big! You ARE blind!”
She really embarrassed me. She is too rude and unprofessional, without courtesy.<//text>

I frequently visit the bay area and when I'm in San Jose / Santa Clara this is my go-to spot if I come down with anything like a sore throat. They're also great for quick vaccinations to prepare for the flu season.

Horrible, horrible.  Will never go back.  We were the only patient there and yet still had to wait 30 min to see doctor.  Husband finally went out to act like he had to pee, they came in right away and the doctor had been out in the main area sitting and visiting with the staff.  Bed side service was awful.  Concerned my son had a broken arm and they just grab it and pulled, no sympathy from doctor or nurse.<//Text>
