< review>
Bank of America as a whole is horrible, especially for business customers but this branch is THE WORST. The branch closes at 4pm now, when it’s actually open. Often times, it’s not open for no apparent reason and without warning. It’s hilarious and embarrassing that mom and pop businesses have learned to update their hours on Google and Bank of America still can’t figure it out. They don’t care about your business because they already got your money.<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>My biggest regret is moving my personal and business account to this bank. This branch is near my house so I thought it would be easy to be close to my bank. There can be a line to the door (and there often is) and there will still only be 1 or 2 tellers. You can never make a quick trip to the bank. Its a joke.< /review><Date>1598653832864< /Date><username>Robert Wasson</username>< pictures>

During this pandemic, it is already hard enough to get into the bank. I went on monday at 3:44 and they were closed despite their hours showing 9a to 4p.
The Bank of America on Ave L is getting ridiculous.< /text>

This incident happened back in 2009 I felt I should share it. I really never got over it. All I have to say is I went to get cash I received my money in a timely manner. I then went to sears to buy some gifts. Sears told me my 50 dollar bill was a fake. I said I just got that from the bank. I then left the gift and went back to the bank. The teller told me they can not exchange my bill because it was a fake. I explained I received the bill from there branch they did nothing but look at me like a fool. Never went back but I’m here to warn everyone else about Bank of America in general never had a great experience with them. I never got my 50 dollar bill replaced and i find it very shady but don’t let this happen to you please check your bills and bank somewhere else if possible.</Text>

This bank is a joke. They have like 5 windows and only one open with a teller, 12 people online waiting for service 4 employees walking around doing nothing...well greeting customers. If you love to be online for good 20 min. For a transaction this is your bank.

<Review>Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Friday afternoon @4:30 12 people in line and 2 tellers working. But there are 3-5 walking around behind the glass doing nothing to help the people in line. They use to have a business service line but they have removed this service. So you end up standing in line for over 30 minutes to make a 2 minute transaction. If you are looking for a bank please choose another.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Well let me begin: I arrived at 5:30pm and waited to be attended to. Sat there watching him talk to his colleagues for 10 minutes for the man to just tell me that he was with his last customer. I asked how long my  process would take and he said 15-20 min. Mm according to my calculations he had enough time. Sounds lazy to me.</Text>

Severely understaffed. One teller who ignores people and shuffles back and forth behind the glass doing anything but assisting the ten customers who've been in line for a half hour. I have a business and I don't have time for this blatantly poor service.< /Text>

<Text>Bank of America as a whole is horrible, especially for business customers but this branch is THE WORST. The branch closes at 4pm now, when it’s actually open. Often times, it’s not open for no apparent reason and without warning. It’s hilarious and embarrassing that mom and pop businesses have learned to update their hours on Google and Bank of America still can’t figure it out. They don’t care about your business because they already got your money.</Text><rate>1<//rate><Time>1618353203863<//Time>< Pics>

My biggest regret is moving my personal and business account to this bank. This branch is near my house so I thought it would be easy to be close to my bank. There can be a line to the door (and there often is) and there will still only be 1 or 2 tellers. You can never make a quick trip to the bank. Its a joke.</Review>

During this pandemic, it is already hard enough to get into the bank. I went on monday at 3:44 and they were closed despite their hours showing 9a to 4p.
The Bank of America on Ave L is getting ridiculous.< /review>

This incident happened back in 2009 I felt I should share it. I really never got over it. All I have to say is I went to get cash I received my money in a timely manner. I then went to sears to buy some gifts. Sears told me my 50 dollar bill was a fake. I said I just got that from the bank. I then left the gift and went back to the bank. The teller told me they can not exchange my bill because it was a fake. I explained I received the bill from there branch they did nothing but look at me like a fool. Never went back but I’m here to warn everyone else about Bank of America in general never had a great experience with them. I never got my 50 dollar bill replaced and i find it very shady but don’t let this happen to you please check your bills and bank somewhere else if possible.</Text>

<review>This bank is a joke. They have like 5 windows and only one open with a teller, 12 people online waiting for service 4 employees walking around doing nothing...well greeting customers. If you love to be online for good 20 min. For a transaction this is your bank.

Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Friday afternoon @4:30 12 people in line and 2 tellers working. But there are 3-5 walking around behind the glass doing nothing to help the people in line. They use to have a business service line but they have removed this service. So you end up standing in line for over 30 minutes to make a 2 minute transaction. If you are looking for a bank please choose another.<//review>

I went in to withdraw 1,000 I've never been asked for an ID. I know my pin. I give them an expired I'd since I wasn't carrying my updated one. I didnt think I needed it. I was told refused to give me my own money. Not to mention I waited over 30 mins just to get to the teller<//review>

If I could give zero stars, I will give zero because the assistance manager is an unprofessional person. I have a problem cashing my check and instead giving different options to solve this situation, I was mistreated.  I don't know if they receive human resources or human relations courses because they act rude as if they were making me a favor instead of doing business.<//text>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>This place has really good food. Although my sister went in today ( December 2, 2020 ) and asked for no cilantro on my burrito or her tacos and we both received our food with it. It wouldn't be such a big deal but my sister and I are one of the many who eats cilantro and tastes soap. I felt the need to post this because I am currently picking out as much cilantro as I can and it's taking me far too long. Its delicious food.. but I'd appreciate it if they would actually listen to what was ordered. I would definitely recommend this place but I suggest double checking your order</Review>< pics>

Maybe they're new and still tweaking things, but I've had better. Pork tacos were dry, sauce-less, and tasteless. $3 chips & salsa were a big pile of cold, Costco chips and 1/3 cup (the cooking size, the serving cup had barely anything in it) of Pace picante sauce that I already had the *exact same thing at home.* Burrito was mostly rice and sauce, very little of anything else, it wasn't safe-temperature hot or grilled very long, and the tortilla was tough. No website and difficult to find the menu on some social media platforms, but at least the menu doesn't have a million things on it (Paradox of Choice-effect). It was ready fast and it has a good location, but other than that, nothing to write home about so far.<//Text>

Being a vegetarian I've visited Rico's Taqueria twice to purchase a veggie burrito and their enchiladas.

Rico's food has been excellent!!

I'm a Cuban and not an expert on Mexican food, but I can surely insure you that Rico's food is "Rico" "Sabroso" and priced right.

The two other Mexican food establishments in Paradise need to be aware because Rico's is going to take over this town.

I highly recommend Rico's. Located where Celestino's once stood on Skyway. Give this local business your patronage.< /Review>

<Text>Brand new place and I really enjoyed the good. I picked up a pork burrito for lunch. I'm used to either a Chile Verde or carnitas when I order pork at Mexican joints, but this was different in a very good way. It must be a dry rub of some kind. Or something like that. It was a way of seasoning and preparing the pork I simply hadn't had before and I really liked it.

I can be super picky about food and they indulged all of my requests. The young man behind the counter was working really hard to get everyone's order right, and act as translator for the ladies that were cooking, and he made sure my food was made exactly as I like.

Place is starting to get a good reputation in town and it's deserved. I'm super stoked to see a new restaurant opening in town. Will definitely come back.<//Text>< pics>

We drove up 30 minutes to try this place out because of the reviews. What we encountered was a bit different than others reviewed. First we checked out the menu, which was different from the one we saw here on Google reviews, their prices definently went up but they have a larger menu now. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, it looked like there were only two employees there tonight, so thats understandable and not the reason I rated 4 stars. Ordered cheese nachos and added refried beans for one kid (4.99 plus a dollar for beans), this turned out as store bought chips and hotdogs stand cheese sauce. The refried beans were good tho. Next kid got a cheese quesadilla for 4.99. This wasn't bad, tons of cheese on a massive tortilla. Husband ordered a heart attack burrito for 10.99 it was beyond massive worth the price on that alone, however it was super greasy on top and extremely dry insides, that was an overall "meh". I ordered the street tacos with beans and rice on the side, these were very good, I was a tad disappointed at the amount of beans and rice, however, the amount of meat I got on the tacos was well over what was needed, haha, so meh...kind of a disappointing experience, If I drive through I would try it again, but I won't be driving just for this place again.  Hope this helps!<//Review>

EDIT: 3 out of 4 people in my office that ordered now have food poisoning, myself included! Not happy at all

Service was okay, my boss bought my colleagues and I lunch here. The gentleman at the register was kind of rude and when we asked for a big thing of salsa he said it was in the bag. Well as soon as we got back to our office it was a tiny cup of salsa. Not sure if I’d personally go back.< /text>

< Review>
Just went there about 15 minutes ago.  Very limited menu, cold bean * cheese burrito that I ordered.  No sauce offered or in my to-go bag.  Akash (manager) did not have a mask on!  Not happy about that.  This county would like to see this Covid go away and it is places like this that continue this on.  I will pass on this taqueria- there are better trucks in our area.<//Review>

I called in prior to my visit and the customer service was great to the least of my expectations after I had been having a nightmare ordeal with at&t... Lina the manager made me feel a bit more at ease and assured they would their best to work with our situation and make sure we were happy in transferring over to them - We visited the store the next day and were greeted promptly,  courteous - I had asked for Lina specifically considering she was familiar with my circumstances and I didn't want to repeat myself to much in dreading.. In long story short, I feel they are owed at least of a review - They were very detailed and clear in servicing our needs and understanding our needs as well as a customer.. They are very detail oriented and relaxed, I didn't feel rushed or pressured as just another number in sales.. They treated us as they want to be treated. The vibe is comforting and sociable. I didn't dread being in the store during our visit. This trip was well worth my time and hassle free.. and the store is super clean!! Thanks for the deals and taking care of us well

Thank You Lina, Elizabeth & Staff!! 🙌 You Rock

Keep Up the Awesome Service, Thank You for everything you all did to provide the phenomenal service to keep us sane and you saved us money

Your New Customer for Life 🤗</text>

Wanted an upgrade and new service provider while in California for work, but the phone I really wanted wasn't in stock.. I was informed that they can set up my service and have the IPhone shipped overnight, Elizabeth and Robert explained everything very well and were also friendly. If your in the Stockton ares definitely come to these guys,  the entire staff is amazing.<//Text>

This is, by far, my favorite T-mobile store to go into in Stockton. Every time I need help with something, be it upgrading my phone or adding on a line, Lina is an extraordinary help. I recently added a line to my phone and she helped me through the process and even was able to help me keep the number I wanted, she was great! i highly recommend this T Mobile location!<//Text>

I went to T-Mobile in the Weberstown Mall today 2/16 to pay my bill and Jazell was a total Doll! Super personable and handled my payment FAST! After my bill I decided to look at phones to upgrade a line and Lina was very knowledgeable and wasn't pushy at all with any suggestions. I happily made a decision and while waiting for her to get the items Marlisa began my transaction and paperwork. It was insanely easy, FAST and fun! They were all so happy and explained everything I needed to know and of course promoted deals I was eligible for without pressure. THANK U LADIES!!! <3</review>

This was hands down the best visit I ever had to T-Mobile.  My experience at the Manteca location has always been terrible.  Dante and Jazell demonstrated their mastery of customer service.  Dante was knowledgeable, helpful and was very welcoming.  He offered great recommendations based on our needs and even took the time to hand write our bill break down.  He is an absolute asset to this company, and I heartily recommend this store to anyone if the other representatives can live up to his example.</Text>

Jazell Amador Welcomed Me As Soon As I Walked Into The Store. Super Friendly And Good At Giving Details On The Phones I Asked On. I Need To Upgrade Fast Since My Phone Is A Low End Phone. She Recommended Me The Samsung J7 Was A,Good For Its Price. Then Asked On The High End Phones. She Personally Recommended Me The LG V20, Over The Samsung Edge 7 On Price. Just What A Customer Wants To Hear. So Now I Have An Appointment Next Weekend To UpGrade Out Of The Samsung J7, Maybe The LG V20, Or Samsung S7. Decisions????<//review>

5 Stars for our maintenance team. EVERYONE on this team is hardworking and courteous! They are fast and efficient and always a pleasure to see! I have been here 2 years and I want to point out that Brian has always done an outstanding job in all areas of maintenance. He has never said he couldn’t fix something or address our needs. He is kind and hardworking and always willing to go the extra mile to help out. My family and I are blessed to have Brain as our #1 MAINTANANCE MAN. Thank you Brian ✌🏼🤟🏼<//review>

The Glendora Avalon team is very helpful and pleasant! As I walked in, I saw unity within the office and their attitudes was the attitude of service, how may I help
you resolve the issue which was my mistake. I was reassured they would find out what they could do to help and the team did just that!!  The issue was resolved immediately. I always get a call back or if I call someone picks up and helps me. I feel really good about moving into explore this adventure with the Glendora Avalon Family. It’s close to shopping centers and things I need so I’m happy!!! Thank you Glendora team for making the visit a pleasant one!!<//review>

We have lived here over 2 years and there are multiple instances that we needed the support from maintain ace and they never disappointed us , they have resolved the issues timely withe due diligence. Especially Matthew he is amazing, knows his work, very fast and most important follows all the guidelines of being safe. He brought all the necessary measure like plastic covers, masks, shields to protect him and us. Thank you Avalon Maintenance and Management for being good at what you do .< /review>

I have had multiple instances when needling a staff member to help solve an issue. Lucy has been able to help me in a timely and professional manner each time! She even went out of her way to help me jump my car early in the morning! Awesome customer service...and an even better individual! Thank you Lucy!</Review>

Honestly the maintenance staff is my favorite part of living here. Mark D. is always so helpful.

Down part here is security is shot. We have had people trying to break into our storage lockers, stealing packages from the doorstep and nothing is really done to find out who is doing it. The only security measure they took was replacing the locks on storage with dead bolts.</Review>

It’s been a very pleasure experience living here! Convenient parking right outside of apartment on the same floor with gate which feels exclusively convenient and safe. Leasing office is super nice and all the officers there are friendly and helpful. I have once encountered a unpleasant conflict with their safe guard but it all resolved with proper apology and they managed to swap the guy. To be honest, if Avalon community has more in dtla, I’ll definitely still stick with them.<//Review>

A big thank you to Matthew, who always took care of our service requests with his utmost care. He examined our food disposal and noticed that it did had a small leak in it— in less than two days he ordered a new one and immediately got it fixed for us! Last time he came he helped us fix the water stopper in our bathtub. Thank you Matthew for always helping us maintain work area clean and by wearing boot covers, and still be willing to handle our service request at this difficult time! Thank you.<//text>

Because of Mr. Reyes I’ll be able to get a better nights rest and that makes a world of difference to me. He is surely an asset to the team and I’m happy to have a reliable staff member at Avalon.<//Review>

It’s been a great experience staying at Avalon. Starting from the leasing office staff Elsy,Hernan are very friendly and able to help every single way to make our stay comfortable and very patient in answering all my questions. And regarding service agents Irving Reyes is exception among his knowledge over the amenities in the apartment. He will respond almost immediately as soon as the service ticket is put in place.</text>

This is not to be alarming, but to simply warn anyone before they look into this system.
I have been dealing with the leasing office since we decided not to take an apartment. Not only are they keeping the partial deposit, but are also trying to get us to pay the rent for the days they apparently took it off the market. I have been passed around to everyone, and they are threatening to send this to collections. I can’t imagine if we were actually residents here.</text>

<Text>If you would like to be woken up by faulty fire alarms then come live over here ! Or even better ! If you would like to have a homeless man live underneath the stair wells of the apartment building, then you have come to the right place! All of this for the crazy high price of 2,000+ ! Can’t get better than that ! Hate the management . They do not care about their residents, and brush off every credible and very valid compliant as if it were nothing . They need to become better or lower the cost of rent !!!!!

I’ve been here since August and I love this place! Veronica Hecker has been so amazing sine day 1! Showed me a few different floor plans and was so patient with me and all my questions.

<review>Our Avalon experience has been great so far.
Recently we had a minor issue in the kitchen that was quickly resolved by maintenance tech, Brian Noriega. I submitted my request after hours and he showed up at our front door early the next day and fixed the problem in minutes! He was very kind and had great customer service. Valuable employee of Avalon!<//review>< pics>

There are also great amenities on the property like the 24 hours gym, doggy spa and pool/spa. The environment is friendly and very clean!

My roommates and I recently moved from a 2 bedroom into a 3 bedroom. The time span that we had to do this in was restricted which made for a chaotic mess. Alicia, the manager, was amazing during the whole process. She was friendly, helpful, and understanding of our situation. Her demeanor as she helped us is what made the transition so smooth. All the other girls on staff were such great help during this move also!

The maintenance is also wonderful! They are always willing to help you and are sincere about their relationship with you.

Overall, the apartments are gorgeous and the staff is great!

<Review>The walls are extremely thin, I constantly smell marijuana. The floors are also extremely thin! everything echoes. They had a 6 hour test of the fire alarm only giving us 24 hours notice 3 times in the same month! While the maintenance staff is great, and it is a pretty place to live. it's just not worth the money. They don't even have security cameras in the garage. Also the garage was poorly planned out (too narrow). I'm moving as soon as my lease is up.</Review>< pics>

I moved from out of state to the Avalon for a work relocation and have found a very comfortable home to live in. Besides being part of an award winning school district and walking distance to Glendora village, I find the property is always well maintained and the rules are fair and enforced regularly. The couple incidents that I have had were addressed with management immediately and resolved within hours. I also really enjoy the community and the folks who live here are generally friendly. I have three children that live with me part-time and they really enjoy the extra activities like the mothers/fathers day pottery, food trucks and other events that the property sponsors. Overall, I am very satisfied and have enjoyed my time here.<//Review>

The amenities on site are great - dog washing station, nice gym, dog park, pool, clean and well maintained cooking areas, and a billiards room/lounge. The apartments are new, fresh, and the units in building B and C come with AMPLE storage in the garage. Main building storage is less than thrilling in terms of sq. footage given.

I've lived here for two years and never had an issue with neither management or residents. Maintenance is always kept up and the apartment grounds are always free of litter. Brian from the maintenance crew is very attentive, special thanks to him. I did notice some college students since APU is close by, but that doesn't bother at all. It is still a good, quiet place to live... But maybe not to retire.<//Review>

<Name>Jackie Derarus<//Name><review>We have lived at Avalon Glendora for a little over a year now after relocating to L.A. due to a work transfer. We love the community and the management. We just recently moved from the 3rd level to the 1st level and love our bigger apartment. The only issue is our new neighbors above us are extremely noisy and sound like they are coming through the floor. It starts around 6:30am on weekends until late in the evenings. Pretty frustrating. The maintenance crew is great but there seems to be a little confusion when it comes to submitting requests for emergencies. We submitted a request due to an issue with our toilet and exhaust fan running continuously today and we never received a response. We have a 1 bathroom apartment which would be considered an emergency request. Other than that it’s a great place to call home.</review>< resp>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Everything is nice, actually, very nice here at Avalon. The only thing I can say is, if you have  friends and family who choose to visit, parking for them is going to be a major issue.
For the size of this place (huge) the number of spaces for visitors to park is very, very limited. It’s not very often a friend or family member can come over and find a space. Very frustrating! Some of my friends and family would rather I leave my apartment and drive to there place due to the extremely poor parking availability.

Additionally, if you have people living above you, be prepared for the extremely loud noises (footsteps, vacuuming, moving a chair,          etc.  . . .). Many days, a child will run back and forth above me. It sounds like an earthquake, ughhhh. Whom ever designed and built this place did not include any soundproofing whatsoever. Extremely irritating!

The amenities here are top notch (pool, spa, gym, mailroom and free dog spa). Again, the only complaints I have are availability of guest parking and the severity of noise from above apartment.<//text>< pics>

Ashley is AWESOME.

I'm quite the picky individual, but Ashley was nothing but accommodating. She answered all of my questions and provided prompt responses to all inquiries regarding the properties, leases, amenities etc.

The world needs more Ashley's because she makes the leasing process just that much easier and better.< /Text>

I have lived in Avalon Glendora for 3 years and the price of this apartment is very high comparing to other apartments in the area. The Avalon looks like a safe place from the outside, but it isn’t. There aren’t a lot of surveillance cameras in the parking garage or anywhere. My friend had a Mercedes-Benz C63, all four of his wheels got stolen one night. Last night, someone stole my carbon bumper trim. So if you have a decent car, look elsewhere! You should not consider living here.< /review>

Thanks Ellie, she helps us very much since we are aborad. Through the e-mail with Ellie, we rented and settled down the basic furniture before we arrived here. She is really good and considerable. Withour her kindly help, we couldn't have so smooth settled down while landing. My daughter loves the place very much. Besides a good swimming pool, there is a little area for kids to play. And the best preschool in Glendora is just nearby. We plan to attend the preschool later! It's really fantastic to finish everything in one time!

Other members in the leasing office is always welcome to give us help if we need. The place is safe and clean. And a supermarket is just nearby, we can get almost everything we need.

The community has great environment with swimming pool and spa  ( 8:00AM to 10:00 PM), well-established fitness center, and great maintaenance team. When we had some troubles inside our apartment, we just gave them a call, and the fixation is included the renting. The maintenance team is professional and quick, we don't need to worry about to find others for help.

Besides, the community is very friendly to pets. If you have a lovely pet, you should love this place very much!<//Text>

Great place to live! Very calm & mellow here nice atmosphere!
Great staff and management , Veronica and Connie always there when ihave or need anything and are very friendly and communicative !
Maintenance staff great ppl!
Area is great as well!
Pool and amenities are Great! (maybe later hours for weekends? , would be nice)
Little guest parking

Trash rooms and hallways leading to can use a little more upkeep and maybe add air fresheners...

Have had a few (3) garage theft issues that were uneasy to understand due to gated community and security ,plus cameras and has happened relatively close in timing (some concern there considering ipark in garage)<//review>

It is a beautiful and well designed complex. I am on the 4th floor and my main window looks out to a gorgeous courtyard below. The kitchen is spacious with a lot of cabinets and an island which gives me plenty of workspace and doubles as our dining area. The 2 rooms are spacious and well lit. The little private balcony is perfect for sitting out and enjoying some quiet time. I love that we have access to a 24 hour gym within the complex and that the mailroom has parcel pending convenience.  We can pay rent, check our status, ask questions and put in service requests online. When I did put in a service request to fix a leak under my kitchen sink, maintenance responded the very next morning and resolved the issue promptly. Moving can be quite stressful, but the leasing office at Avalon Glendora helped make the transition for us a relatively painless process. I am very happy that we chose Avalon Glendora to be our new home!</Text>< user_id>

1, no grass for the dogs, little dog park
2. trash shuts smell really bad no air ventilation
3. too far away from the street so I had to buy a carriage to take my dog to go pody
4. I was lied to, I was told that Route 66 wasn't a very loud street and I found that it was and many fire trucks came loudly by everyday. Don't rent on the street side, very loud traffic.
Dog rent to expensive since there isn't any grass

On the other hand the staff are helpful< /text>

I am so astonished that this property has gone this down. Regardless any problem happened, the way they raise their review is to somehow buy fake review. I clearly remembered less than three months ago, the review is super bad and around two star. How could it be possible that all of the sudden there are so many great reviews and they are even from one year ago? Unfortunately I did not take screenshot of that time, cause I don’t know this is how they improve their service. To be honest, the maintenance team is fabulous. But the manager office, I have no comments. They constantly changed the team and now the new team seems like super hash on their residence. Not even mention everything is overpriced, noisy college kids. Now the guest parking became almost none since the realtor shop on the first level opens which took almost half of the guest parking. I agree every apartment has problem. Just too disappointed the way they handle the problem, given they are Avalon and suppose to be more professional.

By the way, check the Facebook review, how bad it is. But maybe they will soon buy good review on FB too.

One year ago my review: Overall, the apartment is brilliant, clean, quite and brand new.

However, the guest parking spaces are limited and they have to be put on the safelist after 9:00pm (only 10 slots for each month per residence, which is not enough for some time).o< /Review>

Management is a little slow to solve the issues but they got them fixed, clean amenities and a really nice neighborhood; the gym is open 24/7 which is a really good thing for me.<//Text>

Quail lake is really nice place to go fish and enjoy the scenery. There is a trail around the lake. Good place to bring the family and enjoy the outdoors during this time of lock downs. Very few people on the weekdays that I have visited. There are portopotties in the parking lot but some were so full they were usable. But aside from that all was fun times!<//Review>

<Review>I had been driving by and admiring the view for years until recently when I stopped and hiked. Very nice lake. Much more to it than can be seen from the road. Worth stopping for. Good hiking, fishing. Maybe camping too?<//Review>< user_name>

<Text>It use to be a nice, clean, secluded place to fish. Now you have people actively over fishing, ignoring the law, littering, and sometimes even dumping all their trash straight into the lake. Truly disappointing.  The locals barely fish here anymore because of problems from people from outside of the area, often from the LA basin.

It can be great again if there was more law enforcement in the area, as well as Tejon Ranch making good on their promises.

Only time will tell if this lake will go back to being what it was.</Text>< Pictures>

Wow if you want to get mad at the disgusting and careless leeches that you call humans come to quail lake. The lake is dirty and filled with dead bait from the fishermen. This "lake" is more like shreks swamp but with more garbage and broken glass from the crackheads pipes.</Review>

<Review>I love it. I been fishing at quail lake for very long time. I remember there was only a hand full of people who respected the lake kept it clean. Now we have lots of poachers or the throw nets to catch fish. I even picked up a 100 foot net. There’s also these asians go there and they go in the water or netting smaller fish without license. YOU CANNOT SWIM at Quail lake. It’s water that comes out of your tap in Los Angeles. Hello people respect the lake keep it clean and don’t act like you can’t speak English.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Absolutely beautiful and worth the trip from LA. Make sure to climb the steep hill to the right of the Redwood grove for some great views. The park was stunning and well maintained.< /Review>

Giant sequoias and California redwoods (also called coast redwoods) are nature's skyscrapers. These enormous trees exist primarily in Northern California, Oregon and Washington and though they have a number of common characteristics, including distinctive cinnamon-red bark, they are different

visit redwood grove park and enjoy the shade of the redwoods and the fresh green of their branches, as their height is spectacular.

It is a small but very cozy place, the only thing I do not like is that most people do not wear masks to protect themselves and to protect others.  I feel that we still need to be taking care of ourselves, even if you are vaccinated you must protect yourself. If you want to visit it, take your mask for safety.
Hermoso parque muy tranquilo y de muy fácil caminar con un sendero muy bien cuidado y accesible.< /text>

Wonderful place to come with the family. Only place with so many redwood trees in Socal. Great place to take photographs and walk among the giant trees. You can feel the temperature difference on a hot day due to the tree canopy.< /review>

Beautiful, peaceful, serene, and relaxing little walk. Go by yourself for some meditation time or with the kids for an adventure. Great place to take your horse, or walk your pups as well. ❤< /Text>

Amazing getaway from the sea of urbanization. Even on a hot day you might want to bring a light jacket because as soon as you get close to the grove, the temperature drops by a considerable amount!< /text>

Very calm place, the Groove itself is just a small bit of the trail but definitely with checking out. There are some benches scattered but not many. Nice to sit and listen to the birds after a walk.<//Text>

It's fairly small but still worth seeing. The trail to the redwood is very easy. The path is fairly wide. The trail is dog friendly. Definitely recommend leaving your dog on leash since there are plenty of cyclists on the same trail. The trail is easy enough for young kids as well. Stroller accessible for the most part, although I'd recommend using the sports stroller.<//Text>

This little "secret" spot is beautiful and I wish I would've known about it sooner. As someone who's never found an opportunity to drive up to the big redwoods up north, to get a little taste of the experience 10 minutes from home was awesome!</text>

<Review>I loved this little grove. It’s so cute and it’s not far off of the main park area. It’s also very cool compared to the rest of the trail, so it’s quite refreshing.

It is definitely worth checking out in my opinion.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Name>Shelby M< /Name><time>1596419273068<//time>< Response>

A little hike, but they have the red woods and reindeers for the family during Christmas. They kept this hike interesting because they had Christmas Gnomes posted all the way till u get to the Redwoods. It was a very entertaining way to spend a Saturday. My kids lived the petting zoo and the arts and crafts. I recommend that if u didnt go this year to make sure to get tickets next year.< /Text>

The redwoods are a refreshing respite here in SoCal.  Read all the information plaques posted as you walk or ride through.  The temperature drops 10-15 degrees by natural cooling of the redwoods.  The redwoods are a natural wonder for us here in SoCal!< /Text>

<text>If you’re looking for a hiking spot in North Orange County, I would recommend this trail. The trees are only a small portion of the potential adventures you can have. There’s a trail that goes to Carbon Canyon regional park, and if you’re feeling fit, the initial trail down to the redwoods is steep and makes for a good workout. There are water fountains among the trees to fill up your bottle too.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>I love this place. The hiking trail is mostly flat and easy, but watch out for poison ivy (which is clearly marked) and red ants. Most of the trail is sandy dirt and there is hardly any shade, but once you get to the redwood trees everything changes and it is just beautiful. Plus these are probably the only redwoods in Southern California so its definetly worth the trip.<//review><GmapID>0x80dcd479b0b0ec0d:0x53e047e97b4a6819< /GmapID><time>1537626625745</time><Rating>5</Rating><response>None</response><userid>115465714557371197776<//userid>< Name>

tucked away from chino hills state park, this redwood grove was planted in the 70's and features redwoods that are nearing 100 feet tall. walking though the grove, you can feel the difference in temperature and how much cooler they keep the surrounding air. great spots for kids or a short hike.<//text>

The directions led us essentially to a suburban neighborhood. We ended up going to the park and paying the entry fee, but the actual trail and parking lot was closed. Confusing and disappointing!<//text>

It's a great place to see redwoods rarely found in SoCal.  A nice place to walk if it's not too hot. The Redwood Grove was planted from seed in the 1970's donated leftover seeds froma local bank give away.  - - - There are larger Redwoods and Sequoia near Mr. Baldy on the Ice House trail N. of Claremont, CA, when sometimes parking can be problematic on busy weekends -- at times it's best to visit on a weekday.< /Review>

<text>This is a serene hideaway nestled between Prospect trail and Carbon Canyon Regional Park hiking trails. There are a few benches and trash cans available for picnicking. It's wonderfully quiet, far away from any street noises. Upon entering the grove, there's a sign warning of the possibility of seeing a mountain lion. We did not see any wild cats, but we did see a coyote walking through the area. Just be aware that you are walking into a place where animals may roam.<//text><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dcd479b0b0ec0d:0x53e047e97b4a6819<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

Its nice, calm and relaxing nature area to visit. Even on a hot day, the temperature feels much cooler because of the shade provided by the redwoods.< /Text>

Super fun short hike. There are about 240 Redwood trees in the grove. Perfect on a hot day.<//Text>

Awesome little paradise of redwoods in southern california! Easy access park at carbon canyon for 7 bucks. The trail id say is a mile behind park. 30 min hike time. Make aure you stay to the right so you do not take a trail that veres off in the park. This trail will lead you to a grove of redwoods. Lots of different birds small animals and reports of mountain lion. Fun for a date hike, bringing the family, scout adventure, and so on. Id say the hike difficulty level is only a 1/10. Dogs are allowed on leash and i believe park is open from 7am-5pm<//Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>My friend suggested we try El Salvadoran tamales and oh what a wonderful experience! We sat outside. The place was full of people who seemed to be Salvadoran, a very good sign.

The lady I assume to be Xina was warm, calm, kind, and unflappable. She made me feel like her only customer while the room was packed with people.

Sitting in the sun outside to eat the tamales, she served us in the same manner as inside, warm, calm, kind, and unflappable. And the tamales were beyond incredible! I'm already hooked on Mexican tamales. These were entirely different in texture, seasoning and in taste and they were fabulous. The vegetable was mixed into the masa harina dough and the beans were a paste inside. Sorry those of you used to this presentation thinking, "Duh!", but it was all new and exciting for me. The price is right too. Where are 10 stars when you need them?< /text>< response>

You got to try the pineapple spicy burger and the lupus as with jalapeños. Both of them are extremely tasty.

This is one of those hidden gems in a small city.  I had the chicken and cheese  pupusas, enchilada and hot  cinnamon milk with roasted corn drink.  Everything I ordered was very good including the price.  People working there were very nice. Definitely a good place to try.</review>

<Review>This place is unbelievably good! The pasteles were WARM and so delicious! I even tried the Tres Leches cake, and it wasn’t DRENCHED with leche but it was still soft and exactly what I was craving after a long hike. Support this local business! This plaza also has a variety of food choices—from fish and chips to authentic Mexican and Salvadoran. I want to come back and check this place again and the plaza!</Review>< username>

Also like their corn cake.
I have tried their semita alta too and it was decent.its basically like a thick gooey cake which has some fruit jam like layer.< /Text>< Pictures>

Based on my exp. We called 2 weeks ago for custom cake , they asked for design by sending email. We send info of the cake and when we call the next day, they ask of what kind of cake do we want (or flavor) so we gave it already, they said they will call for the price. After a week, we decided to call and we found out that the one who will make the cake left for vacation so they cannot make it. Isnt this stupid? Good thing we asked for a month or atleast we will celebrate without a cake. Never again.
No for recommending as they apply unprofessionalism. At least try harder. If you are in my feet, you know the feeling.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The service is great, they always recive me with a smile on their faces and with the order just made, the music that is heard in the place is not bad either. But the pupusas god if they are like in my country. It's a bit of El Salvador. Returning to the service, the food is almost instantaneous and breathes harmony. When you eat there, you are always taken to the table with delicacies. And then they come over from time to time to see if we need something else. Simplify 5 stars. Many thanks for Xinia's Bakery service.

(Original)
El servicio es magnifico, siempre me reciven con una sonrisa en el rostro y con la orden recien hecha, la musica que se escucha en el local tampoco esta mal. Pero las pupusas dios si son como en mi país. Es un pedacito de El Salvador. Regresando al servicio, es increible la comida esta casi al instante y se respira armonia ademas cuando se come ahí siempre te llevan con delicafesa la comida a la mesa. Y luego se acercan de vez en cuando para ver si necesitamos algo más . simplimente 5 estrellas. Muchas gracías por servicio Xinia's Bakery.< /Review>

I just rented a second time from Midway. The staff there is friendly, professional and make everything easy as can be. Last time I rented I needed to switch cars because I needed an SUV and they made it easy and painless. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.< /text>

Rented with them twice during my trip. Great rates and the service is even better! Both of the guys were extremely personable while still being professional. The service will definitely make this my go to rental location when I'm in the city!<//review>

<Review>I am so thankful for the help I received from Joey since the beginning of my rental journey. My car was at a body shop and for some odd reason it took MONTHS to fix and required me to continue extending my rental and/or getting on to a new rental. Joey managed to help me through these months of rental by finding me the best car for a good rate. He knows how to handle stressful situations and stressful customers like me. Not at one point was he ever rude or had bad attitude. Upon picking up my rental he even showed me cool features of the car and how to use certain things. He also explained payment information very well and safety coverages. Joey did an amazing job helping me with EVERYTHING. I definitely recommend MIDWAY RENTAL. Thank you Joey!

Oh AND during this pandemic, they sanitize EVERYTHING. THANK YOU!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Response>None< /Response><Pics>None</Pics><Review>I had an easy and uneventful experience here, which is all I ask when renting a car. I had reserved a Prius and received one. Picking up the car took about ten minutes, and dropping off was even quicker. The staff were all friendly.  As some other reviewers have noted, the car was not brand new or in pristine condition, but it was newly cleaned and perfectly fine for the purpose. I would definitely come here again.<//Review><name>Danielle J.Wood< /name><rating>4<//rating><GmapID>0x80c2bb76fec7401f:0xfc579d41832c4d86<//GmapID>< date>

<Review>Visiting my son in Midway Car Rental Los Angeles West LA and needed a car for the day for a trip to Muir Woods.  City Rent-A-Car was excellent!  They made it easy to reserve, pick up, and return and were extremely friendly, too.  So glad I passed up the "big name" rental car places.  Midway Car Rental Los Angeles West LA rates were lower, too.  I will rent from them when I visit San Francisco again.< /Review></record>

<Review>This place has amazing service. I originally booked a car with Payless and was vastly disappointed with their long wait times and lack of professionalism. In contrast, I was quickly assisted at Midway and the front desk employee helped me navigate the different options before I made my ultimate purchase. Also, Midway includes free roadside assistance which is especially helpful when traveling in a new city. I highly recommended Midway if you're traveling from CAX or just need a car in CA!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Amazing service! This is the second car I purchased from City Toyota and both experiences has been easy. Midway Car Rental Los Angeles West LA  and Yessenia are a power team. Chris helped me with the financial aspect while Yessenia assist me in choosing the car that fits my family. She explained every feature and made sure that it was what I wanted and needed. Chris made the paperwork part painless. He broke down the numbers and ensure that it was affordable. I definitely recommend coming to City Toyota for your next purchase!</review>

Turo has comparable prices, but Turo always has mileage limits whereas Midway Car Rental Los Angeles West LA doesn't, so you can drive to CA and back if you wanted to. Also, even if you're not sure if you need a car, just reserve it since they have free cancellations on the basic cars.</review>< Date>

<Time>1388436562625< /Time><rate>4</rate><Review>Some of the reviews below are certainly outdated. I was in LA two weeks ago and the service was outstanding. I called them after I landed to pick up a car, not only did the person on the phone go through a number of choices and prices, they were running a sale for the weekend. I got a nice Mustang GT convertible for the day (originally), paperwork took a few minutes, because they didn't take any information over the phone. Outside of that, they had the car ready to go, total time was about 15 minutes at the store. The girl that helped me walked around and pointed at the minor blemishes and marked them on the paper. On Sunday, I needed the car for another day, so I called them at 10am, and requested to extend my rental, they had no issues doing so and kept the sale rate for the second day. I didn't even have to go resign any additional paperwork, what a convenience! Returning the car was also a breeze! They offer pickup and drop off to my hotel so don't even have to worry about taking a cab there. I have an office nearby and will certainly rent from them again even though there is another car rental in my hotel! Only reason I left off one star is that the car's exterior could've been kept a little cleaner, it was probably hibernating since 60 is "cooler" in CA, I had come there from 30 degrees in NYC so I can understand. Also - they close at 5pm on Saturday, which isn't bad, but the gated lot prevented me from taking the keys and coming back later for the car since my friends were waiting to go out (however, I would have a gated lot too if I kept such nice cars)! Thanks Midway - I'll see you again soon.< /Review>< Pics>

The people were initaltly polite but the service was the worst of all time. I will never rent from them again. Had to wait an hour and forty-five minutes for my car which had been reserved for two weeks and then instead of the compact I wanted I was stuck with a minivan. On top to that, the manger was a jerk and offered to allow me to return the vehicle half full and then hassled me when I did what he told me to do and wanted to charge me. WORST RENTAL EXPERIENCE EVER!<//review>

We recently ordered clown cones from this location, they were ready the next day and they really went above and beyond our expectations. We asked for lots of frosting, and they added Christmas trees to the reverse side of each cone. It was adorable! Great job crew at Clovis Baskin-Robbins<//Text>

<Review>“Manager” Kasey just refused to give me my quart of ice cream employee Julianna forgot to put in the bag and told me he couldn’t give me his managers name! I called after I realized she forgot the quart and she told me to come back and she’d give me one. Then Kasey intervenes and tells me  I have to find the receipt, even thought Julianna didn’t mention anything about needing my receipt. Kasey  made me feel like a thief. I gave Julianna a $4 tip so why would I try and steal a quart of ice cream? I had to bug my friend to locate and text me the receipt and guess what, no apology from anyone in the store! Worst customer service ever!< /Review>< Pictures>

Ordered a cake with a photo on it went to pick it up and the photo was not even recognizable! Pixilated and it came out almost completely neon green they never bothered to call. All they told me was their boss just said that’s how the photo ended up printing, I would think if they knew the photo didn’t come out right they would call to let me know or send them a new picture but they were super nice about a refund.< /text>

<text>I would give a zero star if I could. I ordered a cake for my son's 9th birthday over a week ago online and when  I showed up to pick up they had no clue. I've ordered cakes from other Baskin-Robbins and never had any issues they would call me a day ahead to confirm my cake.. This place was unprofessional about the situation trying blame other people for the mistake because "they didn't see the order" on their end and ruined a surprise for my little boy on his special day. Thanks for nothing!</text><Date>1588007652638</Date><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

Zero stars!!!!
Was given a time to come pick up an ice cream cake I ordered over a week ago. I went to the store at designated time and no one was there, the store was closed. (i wasn't the only one waiting for them to open) I then called every half an hour and no one answered. Four hours later I went down to the store AGAIN and they were open. The cake was late to the party, this was a needless hassle.  The employees didn't even seemed bothered by all the trouble they had cause by "opening late".

EDIT: the previous post happened last year. I thought I'd go back since I saw that they had $1.50 scoop on the 31st of the month. I even checked online to make sure they were participating in this deal and the website said they were. I went in and waited in line only to find out that "corporate doesn't do that anymore" I wasn't the only customer annoyed.< /text>

Super convenient location. Not too much indoor seating, so be prepared to take it and go if you are with a crowd.<//Review>

Friendly staff and Limited hours make it a fun afternoon/early evening hangout, but not a rowdy get drunk kind of place.  Tried both the Alpha Stout and Apple Lager, both amazing.

Back for another visit... compass rose lager and an enigma cloud of confusion IPA... place is still amazing!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7OokuyD-hCWFhzGQ3S1wXEcG-UBO0t7s0A8s2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPII545voWL2jxgFB6T3w6VpariNH4CP49W5jWD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2767G-BtsqmXNLW4-f8CJZSGbHWa_mzaeO_CI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Absolutely amazing beer at this place, we went for their 3rd year anniversary and they had so many ppl and it was just great company. It was my first time here but definitely worth multiple visits. They had live music, catered food and amazing beers. I had their sampler and got to try 12 beers! So good! But I have to say their trailblazer is the best! Well if you like dark beer. But if you like light beer their guava beer is soooo good! It tastes like lemon/guava beer man I love that one to! If I had to summarize this place I would say its simple, a hidden gem and definitely worth multiple visits. If they keep up the great work I will certainly return!<//text>

This is an interesting place and probably one you may not have been to before. There is every kind of beer here imaginable and it is a great place to get together with friends. The people who work here are so nice and answer any beer questions you may have. A lot of fun for a reasonable price.<//text>

<review>These guys take their time and make great high quality beer. The jalapeño beer doesn’t just have a nice pepper flavor, it’s HOT. The porter and boysenberry sour were also excellent. I check out all the breweries in the area and this one has the best beer so far in the highs desert. Come support them and enjoy some brews in this heat!<//review><resp>None</resp>< Pics>

Small but mighty.  Great beer, good people.  Their beers are good and stylistically correct.  Give me another year or two and I'll hack google to give them six stars.</Text>

< Review>
I wanted to try this place about a year ago and when I chatted with a few guys at another restaurant (Los Domingos!), I was told that on Thursday nights at 7pm, they do trivia night "Geeks Who Drink" and so I went there to taste the brews and play and had a great time with the people there....very friendly and somewhat hip.  My favorite: the Imperial IPA.  Will definitely do another visit and will bring a friend.</Review>

Decent beer, definitely overpriced!! Encountered a rather rude and unfriendly server Fri aft, 30 Mar.  And they do not have the traditional glass growlers and at the same time refuse to fill other growlers - instead, they tried to sell me one of their steel growlers for $60 - seriously folks what are they thinkin?!!! In spite of decent beer they have lost me as a customer and I won't be goin back!!!< /Review>

Must go place for beer lovers!  DON'T THINK, GO!

The Hefewiese was the best American made I have had many Hefe's from breweries from Coast to Coast try this and they have all failed to capture that Bavarian essence.  Reminds me of a Ayinger Beer I love.

I'm a hop head and their IPA'S are killer.  From nose to finish they are very satisfying.

Most tap rooms  have there standard pablum offerings for the cross over crowd/market.  This is not the case here after having many offerings of the 13-14 brew in house and on tap. All beers are above average to great.

The tasting room is as tasteful and cozy as any tap room I've visited in my travels across  America.

The family of Brewers are very hospitable and appreciate their customers.< /text>

<text>This place is probably the best (and most convenient) hiking park in the south bay. Plenty of different hiking paths mostly flat some with moderate slope. There are a lot of shaded trails too.< /text>< user>

< Review>
The views were amazing and the hiking trail was challenging. There were areas where the gravel caused the ground to be a tad slippery, but overall it was a great hike with even better views. We hiked a total of 10km and felt great after.<//Review>

My favorite hiking spot! There are different trails of various difficulty level. One sees a lot of wild life here.
On weekends finding a parking spot can be difficult  7:30 am onwards. There is plenty of parking, though. Sometimes I go back and park on Cristo Rey drive and hike a mile (on a trail) to the Preserve which isn't a big deal.
Beautiful wild flowers in spring and, if the winters bless us with good rain, a pretty creek to throw pebbles in.<//Review>

Great please for hiking with family to the farm which is approximately 1.2 miles each way. For the hard core hikers or runner, they can go up to PG&E trail and even up to black mountain. Parking is challenging on weekend.<//text>

<Review>This is one of my favorite hiking parks because it has some challenging parts paths and some simple paths. It's a great place to go for ease or a challenge. And most of the paths I have taken can be completed in 1.5 hour or less.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>One of the best areas to go hiking in the bay area. So many different trails to hike on and explore. Lots of trails with good shade too for hot days. Should try the pg&e trail, it’s one of the hardest ones there but really worth it for the views. There’s also a farm too, great place to take children. One downside is that parking can sometimes be impossible on busy days.<//text>< pictures>

This is THE place for getting a good exercise by hiking! The wildcat loop trail has a very good elevation and is absolutely gorgeous! I totally reccommend this trail! The vista point was beautiful too! This reserve has many one-way trails due to the pandemic and they are very comfortable to be explored 😌 If you have pooches that are adventurous, then this reserve is not for them since dogs are not allowed. But it is amazing for us, humans, to get a fresh start here! The weekends are very busy though, so I reccommend coming earlier in the morning to get a parking spot! It's great for kids too, especially since they can be engaged with picnic tables that are everywhere for quick snacks and also because of the wild turkeys, deer and the cute animals in the farm located in the reserve! I also recommend you to take lots of water and snacks to stay hydrated ☺️☺️</review>

Large park with a lot to offer. Great for all different levels and families. The park is rather full from 10-12pm and parking can be difficult.</Review>

A great place to walk during the week. You can get fantastic views of the South bay, and nice walks through the woods, and through the open spaces. Weekends are a bit crowded however, so if you can make it, see it during the week.<//text>

Very decent set of trails... Great views from some of the peaks. The one challenge sometimes is parking. Often difficult to get quick parking at certain times of the day during the weekend.... But that also shows how popular the location is...</Review>

Nice place to hike albeit a little long at 8+ miles if you take the high meadow trail. Lots of crowd especially in the weekends and parking gets full pretty soon. Views are not exhilarating but there are a few points to lookout for. Restrooms only near the parking lot as expected so plan accordingly. Trail is moderate and can be done by beginners as well. Deer can be spotted.<//Review>

I have hiked every trail. Do you doubt
my conviction? The proof is the
pictures. Depending on your comfort
level you can choose your own
adventure! Bring your water,
sunglasses, trail mix, a proper hiking
hat, shoes with good insoles and a
enthusiastic mind that desires to
wander and meander FREE. The most
preserve parking spots around.
Rancho will not let you down. Rejoice!
Starting out with Deer Hollow Farm
is great. What comes next is up 2 U.<//review>

Love this place for weekend hikes. Get here early because the parking lots get packed. Many trails of varying lengths good for the hiker who has an hour to those who have all day. Enjoy!</Text>

<Text>Beautiful place, though on weekends and during covid it is actually extremely crowded, even at 9am. Parking later than that can be tricky.

The deer hollow farm is closed for the time being due to the pandemic, but sometimes you are lucky to see the animals through the fences< /Text>< pics>

The staff has done a great job creating one way trails with easy to follow signage.    Hidden in the hills of Cupertino, this is worth the drive. Beautiful views, seasonal water and a farm!(not open due to Covid). Perfect for hiking, picnics or just to relax in the open meadow area.<//review>

<Review>This place paints a different picture, answers my different call and brings a certain comfort for me each time I need to get away from the chaos of urban living, stressful work weeks and noisy busy streets.

Though a popular spacious place and often filled with floods of people on the weekends, this space has a variety of offerings--lush greens, wandering animals, beautiful meadows, bubbling creeks, leisure paved paths and higher trails that lead to more quietude for those that crave for moments of peace and meditation.

If you're intentional about seeking out some solitude to clear your mind, listen to the sound of nature and spend a little time in contemplation while admiring God's creation right in your South Bay backyard, this place just may be a sweet gem you need without committing to a long drive--it's easily accessible and a quick ride from most of local neighborhoods.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Great hike. Took a wrong turn or missed a sign somewhere and ended up on the PG&E trail. Ended up as a 4 hour hike but all worthwhile! Signs could be better 😉< /Text>< Pics>

Amazing place to hike, very nice and clean trails. I highly recommend to go here, but remember to bring water since there are no taps there where you can refill your bottle.<//Review>

<username>Amy C< /username><text>My favorite place to go hiking. There are multiple trails to choose from with great views of the Bay Area. If you go early in the morning, you're more likely to catch deer grazing. There's also a lot of wild turkeys. When it's hot out, be careful of rattle snakes sunbathing in the middle of the trail. Due to the rainy season, there's been quite a spectacular bloom of wildflowers. There are nice restrooms in the two parking lots closest to the trails and a restroom by the farm. On a good weather weekend, you'll need to come early, otherwise, expect budgeting time to hunt/wait in line for a parking spot.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNitARtoy-LNdAFjsc6LfbWVGvG0jJdCzknR64c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFQ9HDY3dHkhnbEWl5MkUGGdsjjcgd2vHevnKW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOu6Rn9snmscg78_6-tZIlIlOFc1unmvqFnGin=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe8NrJnnhfjyZFocfV_4MMLBF4_Fd-YsN1rROp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5OFOguKVuckUeAVkBJDB0krC1TwUv686kbOti=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCmhcjujhKT0B6xbKlLDSifMybLY69fZ-sm8cx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyVAj8pdeNEHNz9OWm5LjCAYDSJ6-bpSI7M07N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM71hqreYnUeRBoIJM76s2ckABL0quAoWOHv8QS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIyOFGZMiCs30hlto0UmmVYZND188lPYxwoB4q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><rate>5< /rate>< gmapID>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>This is an amazing getaway right in the middle of bay area. Very easily accessible from South Bay and is hugely popular among locals. This is not a local city park, it's a natural preserve and stretches across the santa Cruz mountains and is gone to local flora and fauna, including the elusive mountain lions.

The park has many trails and thus doesn't bore you even if you are a regular. If your are training for a marathon, this is the ideal place as it has mostly shaded trails with fair amount of elevation gain. Kids are welcome and you will do many of them. Bikers are welcome too and is a great opportunity to get some mountain biking training done here.

There is also a petting farm located about a mile from the parking lot and is fin with kids. They have goats, sheep and cows.

Make sure to get early as the parking lot gets full very quickly. Or get in later when the earlier ones are leaving.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiCfXgAF1cN-4AQZnl_Nzyf59Fv7HlT-De31ZP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOImHHrfZAF4AE5ak3Y7bpB9KsZY5TfOoZLeKtu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzFfh2VCVYxHxu8EdQ9YoVrHG6ErwR5SIZ_L_e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6MYGaLvpjbtuj0CWL_0uIggGsVHTDjm4PqfWN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEch5pwOgp1YB51MwX7wT3oMItNpQSBhpep3C2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKzlMxVHvM1xQ58zNN4QhBRasZPGP80dXgqwHR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWUm3MmvY1wPdS5JPuzZMLGTo5j0U2N0bM4-Ap=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPznYRq8rgHM7dOQohG_qsOQ3DT4Lo3Lq6ZTKKf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJxtRA8qYoCT3SNssIgwMYE6A_lrwPs-0fKXqX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV3UhQ2HNH9i5RYpvaA2xyvhBcH7gS5T7wBBG2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcV1bt72RUvHVuZ0W0j8HPUVPo4x_fl2d7GZAh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVQM3ZkX5pyv9Z1figTdManbvpKTiMVKUDv2-z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPv5XaMTOONBrwQ-6PlS6pjRnSe9gjzeYhQQihX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1t--XBTS2qT1C4Xj-awC6XHOW8JK4g0kgM_0I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtbnLvYRBWZ6mG2NxcvgF0CxkQK_NSMXGE4Pe5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPM7Ra8Skt7vZnb2VaftDiWw3gBzfL7wj7-iKas=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics></record>

<Review>Amazing place for short and long hikes there is a farm in between that is lovely to watch if you want to separate from the crowd go towards the farm and make a left in interact the left side is more shaded and after rain you will hear and see water flow next to you if you prefer open space go right or continue straight. Bikes are only allowed untill certain extent so plan accordingly.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Large nature area with over 20 trail of various difficulties. Scenic with wild turkeys and deer. Great for family or seasoned solo hikers. Benches around for relaxing sits and some picnic tables for groups. Paved road for walking makes for easy treks for those of us with a bad ankle or knee. So close to home right off I280. Remember to bring water and enjoy nature.< /review>

One of the best places in the bay area for hiking, biking, or to go visit with farm animals. The trails are well marked, and most of the reserve is accessible for kids as well. The kids will love Deer Hollow Farm where they can get close to goats, sheep, pigs. All in all a beautiful way to disconnect from the Silicon Valley and always on internet... And get closer to nature.</Text>

<Review>Excellent ranch, very recommended for family workout with kids. Clean and well made trail for both pedestrians and bikes at all levels. What’s amazing is the delicate farm full of cows, sheep/goats, ducks and hens/roosters! We also saw wild deers and turkey close to the trails! Kids love it so much! Thanks to park/farm management and volunteers who preserve this place to be like a hiking paradise for the community! Will definitely visit more often in future!<//Review>< pics>

Amazing experience. Really scenic and good walking paths. The awesome weather added to the experience. My one-year old nephew loved his evening stroll here. Saw some turkeys and deers on the way. I was taking pictures of the turkeys from a close distance and thankfully a park ranger came and warned us not to get too close as they might attack.< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>A very expansive hiking area with miles of incredible trails. You can choose to stay in the flats along the hillside or ascend up the hillside to experience the great Bay Area views. One of my favorite hiking areas in the Bay Area due to the variety and magnitude of trails and size of the preserve. The canyon trail and hike up to the vista point would be my favorite two in the preserve. Well worth a visit if you love to hike.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Something for everyone here.  Need a easy walk with a stroller? Yes.  Need a long climb for your Grand Canyon prep? That too.  Just want to hang out with the kids and chicks (young goats and chickens...) at the farm? Sure.

The parking is lots better since the second lot was remodeled.  If you're thinking of biking, there's a totally different route (not hilly or car-y) for you through the neighborhood in the other side of 280, it's very convenient.< /text>< Pictures>

Beautiful trails, some are designated one way for social distancing. Can get a little crowded on weekends.</Review>

It’s a hiking trail for all ages. It has almost all kinds of trails. Greenery all around. Shades all around👌 very soothing and relaxing for eyes. They have farm to show some animals to kids. Parents take their kids there to show them cow, pig , goat, lamb, many produces like few green vegetables.

You can bring your own food and have a potluck there. I see many teams or groups go there for hiking and after that they have breakfast/lunch/evening snacks etc.

Many fitness freak people also go to this place for their running, elliptical exercises and get a feeling of nature’s lap.

During your hike you can see many deers, peacocks and many many birds chirping. Overall it gives you an amazing feeling.

I personally like this place very much and o often visit this place to do my weekend workout. I feel hiking gives you enough heart pump to get you feel that you are alive.

I strongly recommend everyone to go for walk/little hike/steep hike/ fitness minded friend get together etc. it’s a place for everyone ☺️.

Please check my clicks around this place and you will see what I am I talking.< /text>

Awesome workout place for different levels of fitness and training--from an almost flat 2 mile round trip to the Deer Hollow farm, to a moderate (550+ ft climb) 3 mile closed loop hike/run along Coyote trail (my favorite), to a difficult (1600+ ft climb) 9 mile closed loop hike/run along the PG&E trail.

There is a lot of parking, but this place is extremely crowded during weekends and holidays. Be prepared to wait up to 15-45 min to get parking during busy time. Definitely advise car-pooling if coming here with friends and family. Consider the 'waiting for parking' as a meditation exercise before your workout!😃

Now the best part! This place has awesome trails (especially when various streams have water running), lots of wildlife (birds, snakes, wild turkeys, deers, rabbits, and occasionally mountain lions), and multiple restrooms. The CA park rangers here are always vigilant, and helpful when needed.

The Deer hollow farm is a nice stop for small children if your are here for a casual visit. Updating (3/7/2020) with pictures from the farm (1-2 day old baby goats, and wild tom turkeys performing mating dance).

Update: May 03, 2020. Today we spotted a great blue heron in the preserve. It has been several years since we last spotted them here.<//Text>

Awesome trails for all types of runners, hikers. Steep hills for gruesome LT workout, downhill well paved trails for constant low impact form work.
Been there twice for trail running/ hiking, no complaints, restrooms are quite well maintained too.
It gets dark in some areas of the trails due to trees so make sure you check sunset time before starting your hike/ run.
Climbed 1600, still so much more to go.

Starting at PG&E is better in my opinion as there are more gravel sections which are easier for uphill. Coming down on Coyote is better due to more smooth downhill and no gravel.

Lookout for small tree roots sticking out in the trails, they can be deceivingly high, I tripped on one coming downhill, not a pleasant experience.<//text>

<review>This is an overall great place for outdoor activities...
Great hiking trails, picnic areas, lots of parking options, well kept, dedicated area for RC plane flying, lots of wildlife, and a farm with a diverse range of animals for people to interact with as a bonus.
I highly recommend!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhgSMM5WC6dd5r54pw63TgEeag57Sku703xImN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSAoxSj0YaNXnH5eUpZhGi51DI9UT_hFTauofS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZbEJTTetGnU6OmMq5P_USPm0nr1XKb-lIsnE1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb8jYfi1bqg7nLXnWT8C30poBkPgOLuKD5cBnX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCxPpXGfFrqE_15MfM8Lb4z2xmjix2g6ipHPLN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUhvD71wHYhPUwGBONox99Z5BYiaIP0vIyqV6T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHBfR-9pF2_kd62jH5ZOV6r2pmsBNZd3fLiC1e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTFKIG_hCiDKzfoBgbJjL9DvgeWpXU2SBaQMzr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBJcOStwsCR5mpls06p9cfTRP3REzRZ8-iZykN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8MZJA4LwP7WCiARguPVL-NsCJ9M-Vo4yRrUS5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-Pu2SnCUByPEIFqpUYcf9Pzfw5l5aRoZWumte=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY9g7B0DoM6Jv2qUy4R7pVXg7aCXJ9XojJ5h39=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e<//gmap_id></record>

It’s a great family and kids friendly trial with many trails at various terrains. Free parking but be early to get a spot. Enough restrooms and water fountains.

Animal farm is a mile away from parking lot and everyone loves to witness it. Close to nature just 5-10 miles away from Sunnyvale or Cupertino.<//Text>

Beautiful views and fairly well maintained trails make this a great place for hiking or biking. There's a modestly sized flying field for radio control airplanes and the like. Parking is plentiful, though it got a bit crowded later in the afternoon. Social distancing was not difficult and mask discipline was fairly good if not perfect. Narrower trails have been marked one way to promote distancing, so it's a good idea to consult the map posted at the trail head.<//review>

There are many good short hikes here, and at some view points you can see a view of the south bay and peninsula.  You can also do longer hikes up black mountain, to Rhus ridge or Hidden Villa.  There is a good mix of trails with varied terrain.  Scenery are green after rain, but otherwise some parts are quite yellow in the summer and fall.< /review>

A nice park. There's a good variety of trails - easy ones by the parking lot and tougher ones farther in. The trails have a mix of open views and wooded sections. The farm is neat too. Parking can be tough though.</text>

<Review>Beautiful area. Lots of wildlife to see. Must visit at least once. Lots of nice hikes for all difficulty levels. Some hikes are also stroller friendly.

Make sure to bring sufficient water/ electrolytes.

Always watch your step in the hikes. I have seen people fall and get injured.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

It's a beautiful, sprawling land of dry, dramatic hills and valleys covered in grass and great trees and thick vegetation. Beautiful views.< /Text>

Amazing hike in the Bay area. Covered with trees. Wonderful water streams running beside trails.
If you're planning for weekend hike, parking is limited inside the reserve.
Must do hikes..<//Text>

< review>
Lovely easy nature paths with a sweet creek next to the walking.  Well maintained and my favorite,  the petting zoo after a reasonable over one mile walk. Animals are well cared for,  a very kind docent that was very happy to explain that area and the history. WHAT MYSTIFIED me were the 3 dead wild turkeys we encountered driving away from the place, in the open field across the street from the park. There's bike paths with various levels of difficulty as well as other paths for walking.< /review>

<text>We went at 1pm do there weren’t very many people there which was great. So peaceful and it was a beautiful afternoon. Did the wildcat Loop Trail about 4 miles. It’s the best place to hike. Saw squirrels and wild turkeys. No deer this time<//text>< pics>

<review>Nice hike trails . Lot of trail options from easy to level of difficulty , tree shades along the trail helps during summer day . Verul good option for family.

<Review>Great place to hike. Very accessible - stroller and wheelchair friendly. Maps, restroom, water fountains available. Parking is very tough on weekends though - come early or circle around to get lucky. There is an old animal farm there as well - kids love it.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQNsmQPfZbruDu_wizDdkLvJMz7k_L_EFecls=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMOXw13y4jA_Wb0eMQ6ZkutYIpky8dvvENyEc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvFMIo9o2Q58fY9z5KgYHemV_hj2TOdu3rk-Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm2vBj_RmzIBsGRh49qqw42QL7MU7ewFgvmd8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e< /GmapID></record>

< review>
I went on a Tuesday morning between 7am and 10am. It wasn’t too busy, just enough people to feel safe hiking on my own. The view from Vista Point is worthwhile and a relatively short hike from the farm and entrance.  Saw tons of wildlife and enjoyed the canyon trails and high meadows. Would suggest wearing layers as the temperature change can be quite drastic from trail to trail.< /review>

<review>The parking lot was busy but seeing as it’s a huge park you can have the trail to yourself. Loved the accessibility -saw both elderly and tots enjoying the lush oaks/trails and babu animals at the farm.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>We picked an easy trail.  Round trip was only 2.5 miles.  This was our first family hike since...forever.  at the end of our hike to Deer Hollow Farm, there was a nice little educational shack that kids can learn fun facts about the animals around the area.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>It consists of lot of trails with dense trees. If you are planning to take a longer one (black mountain trail) carry sufficient water as there is no water source anywhere. It is a good hike.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Best place to hike. Has all levels of hike. Mobile Network coverage is good through out. Difficult to find parking. Restroom available at the trial head. There is a small farm for kids to see farm animals. Also, has a launch area for remote controlled air planes.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Great place to go for hikings.
Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic trails are now just one way so you are forced to walk more.
For me that's great but for others who aren't in great shape it might be difficult.</review>

Park itself is very well maintained, lots of trails and wildlife, but by 6:30am, a half hour before sunrise, parking lots were getting crowded.<//Text>

<Text>Enjoyed the hike. Very nice place to start the day. Could spot many deer along the trails. There are multiple trails for hiking. Ample of parking available at the entry. Park opens at 6 in morning (after sunrise) and usually remains crowded on weekends.  One can reach there in 15-20 minutes from Mountain View in early morning. Must visit place if you're travelling to silicon valley for business.< /Text><gmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmapID>< time>

Beautiful open space and trails. We went a bit close to sunset so had to rush, but will definitely return! We did a loop hike that was about 2.5 miles. Perfect for our five-year old. She loved the farm! Looking forward to our next visit!< /text>

Deer Hollow farm loop trail is an easy trail, where the trail paths are well constructed roads. you can take your children along ,and they can ride their scooters as well.
There is a nice ranch created at the end of the trail. The ranch has sheeps ,goats ,baby lambs, turkeys,cows and pigs.
There is a small museum near the Deer Hollow farms , the museum has display of stuffed and preserved animals including red fox, owls, eagles , mountain lions and many more. You will also enjoy the touch table with bones, feathers, leaves,  seeds , fur ,nests and more</Review>

<text>Love this park. Great trail runnning there. Get there early on the weekends! Gets packed very quickly. Also, try the Coyote Creek trail as an alternative to the more popular PG&E trail. Here's a photo I took from top of PG&E trail.</text>< gmapID>

Open free to the public 365 days a year. Open 30 mins before sunrise to 30 mins after sunset.

No dogs allowed.
Helmets required for bikes/scooters/etc (even for adults).
No drones allowed. Fix winged RC aircraft allowed at the runway. (Located near the main entrance).

Parking is competitive on the weekends, easier on week days.

Some beautiful trails, the deeper you go in the less people you encounter.</Review>

This is my favorite place for hiking especially in feb-apr. The creek is flowing and I love it.
There are couple of trails. Also there is a farm which is an attraction for little kids. Usually takes about 1:30 -2 hrs for wild cat loop hike. There are longer hikes available too.
Parking is not exactly limited but it is favorite spot so its hard to find parking no matter what time of day you go.</Text>

Good place to visit for trail lovers, be careful while bringing your children as during summer time you can see snakes near the grass/bushy places. Also there are warning of mountain lion. As we trail we have seen deers and also some creepy sounds inside the forest. Really must try place. But please bring water to keep yourself hydrated.< /review>

This is a great place to hike, bike or run trails. There are trails for every level. Plenty of parking spots with three parking lots. Water fountains are at the Equestrian Parking Lot and the main parking lot at the bottom of the entrance road. It opens earliest in the Summer at 5:30 am depending on the month. It closes at Sunset. My favorite trails are Coyote Trail, Upper Wildcat Loop, Black Mountain Trail, High Meadow Trail and Stephen Arbors Trail which most locals know as PG & E Trail.< /review>

Great place for biking and walking. The area is well kept and there's is plenty of space for everyone. It doesn't feel as crowded as other Bay Area trails such as Sawyer Camp.<//text>

This is the most beautiful hiking place. I have been there almost every weekend for the past 18 years. I saw deers, turkeys, coyotes, snakes, but not mountain lions yet. You can adjust your paces according to your own strengths. Slots of trails for you to pick.<//Review>

Raw nature and beautiful scenic trails that provide walk through both wilderness and open views. Took wildcat loop trail through the vista point. Car parking could get tricky, so better to arrive around sunrise. Will definitely come back to explore more.</review>

This is a go to hiking place if you live in Cupertino, Saratoga and near by areas. There are plenty of trails here. Place is generally busy. Even though there are lot of parking, it can be hard to find parking in the mornings, since it  is a extremely popular hiking spot. PG&E trail is one of the popular trails. You can bring children to show farm animals, there is a picnic area near the farm as well. Great place to visit if you are a hiking enthusiast.<//text>

Deer hollow farm is a popular destination for families with young kids. You can walk or bike there (separate paths). On weekends parking is difficult due to the popularity.< /Review>

Great place to connect with nature and farm life. Park close to the 280 bridge, and walk in to a system of small stroller friendly hikes leading to a farm with goats, chicken and other animals - that kids would love. There is a small picnic area too (restrooms are smelly).
If you want a more strenuous hike, there are trails that lead all the way up the mountain (or around it) and provides some good views from the top.<//Review>

<review>Ranch I San Antonio is a mixed bag overall. There are many great trails to hike, but parking is a nightmare over.

They have done a great job of trying to make many trails one way, but many people violated this. The one way trails also made it difficult to plan a hike as we didn’t know which ones were one way before we came upon them. This not anyone’s fault, but something to know.

It is pretty here and we did see some deer as well l, which is always great, but we likely will hike elsewhere until after the pandemic.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Very popular park - parking lot will get full as early as 6:30am. Come early and be prepared to wait.

Cars usually queue to get a parking, please be considerate and get in the line. Also, parking is first come first serve. You cannot stand on a spot to hold a place for your family. That’s not how it works here.

Always a fun time in this park. Lovely sceneries and great trails to really exercise and enjoy nature.

When we pulled in the parking lot was mostly empty so it appeared to be safe to hike. People on the trail were wearing masks and keeping social distance. The farm is closed for safety. Bathrooms are open for hand washing, etc. The start of the trail has a lot of sun so bring a hat/sunscreen.< /text>

Decent place for hiking. But it seems very popular so parking gets full. I would prefer not so crowded place for hiking.<//Text>

<review>I love the trails BUT hate parking here. People will just wait at an enterence until a spot opens up and cause everything to back up. I wish they have better security circling around to make people move or have signs that say no waiting/stopping. I would just park on the streets and walk all the way to the trail. It's far but at least you don't have to deal with that.< /review>< Rating>

< Review>
This is one of favour parks in the Bay area.  There are lots of hiking trails for all levels.  I have been hiking on the PG&E trail for the last 15 years and never got tired of it.  There are lots shades, ups and downs.  Almost every turn is a new scenary.  I just love it.</Review>

Great beginner friendly trails, nice location. You can also visit the Deer Hollow Farm and don't miss the small cabin there, it houses several taxidermied animals, animal skeletons and other artifacts.< /review>

<text>Beautiful and big park... Only downside is that it can be hard to find parking when it's really busy.  But once you're in the park, it's lovely.  The farm is a big hit with our kids.</text>< Pictures>

Be prepared for a crowd on the weekends, but if you're an early riser and want to run some trails the views can't be beat so close to civilization. The Chamise Trail to Black Mountain Trail is highly recommended for a11 mile loop.< /Review>

This is perfect place for walking, running, cycling, picnic or drone flying. They have spearate path for cyclers at many places. The area is huge and connects more then 10-20 trails. They have barn also inside which was a nice surprise for us. There are multiple places for picnic too. They have 3 parking lots, the first and second one are small but the last parking lot at the bottom is big. They have drone flying zone near first and second parking lot. This is the default place if I am not able to find a good trail to go for a weekend run, thus I have been here multiple times.<//Review>

I would give this place a 5 but parking is EVIL.  There's hardly ever any parking,  bring a lucky person with you when you visit.  If you're able to secure a spot, you'll enjoy this place.  It's good for families and kids and there's a small farm with goats and chickens.

Good place for long distance runs, varying surfaces and good for trail running<//Review>

This trail is so nice and peaceful. Many trail and has a animal farm for kids to play in. Beautiful color changing tree leaves. It can be cold or super hot defending g where you're hiking, make sure you have enough water. PG&E trail is very long and some part are pretty hard. View is amazingly nice<//Text>

I've been going here since I was a kid. Parking is improved and there are a number of trails well kept and of differing length and difficulty, took my infant here and could have done the stroller instead of the carrier with the paved trail to deer hollow farm.< /Text>

<review>Plenty of parking. Very nice hilly trails to run. They recently created One Way routes for most -used narrow trails in respect to "social distancing", so go to the home main page to take a look at the trail maps for new/diverted routes before planning your hike or....just follow the new One Way signs when you encounter them. Happy hiking, stay healthy!< /review><Response>None< /Response><Time>1585710904137<//Time>< rate>

The bit of the trail that’s under construction is said to open later this year in 2020, and hopefully there’s more parking then.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Very easy hike, at least the first mile to the farm.  Our hike today included an encounter with a rattle snake. It was in the intersection of several popular trails so the park rangers moved it to a safer location.

Beautiful area, able parking, perfect for families, hikes and joggers alike. A good mix of paved trails for bikes and strollers and hiking trails. It also had a small farm with cows, sheep, chickens etc. For the kids. A family of deer laying around is great too.< /Text>

This preserve and the trails were my regular weekly haunt years ago. Went back to see how it's changed - 7:40 am on a Sunday morning - and i found the lower parking lot completely full. Saw a few cars occupying two slots, now that's on them.

This preserve has a variety of trails - there is one that will match your own desire for level of activity. From the parking lot, you can tell this is a very popular place - so if you like walking with lots of people, kids, babies in strollers, joggers, this is the place to be! If not, there are hundreds of trails in dozens of open space preserves in the south bay...<//review>

<text>Went for the first time this weekend with a friend and hiked a decently inclined hill, so I noticed if folks wanted a even easier trek there were some nice flatland trails as well. It was pretty populated but that wasn't surprising since it's so close to town but it was a gorgeous get away and we saw so many little cottontails and deer off in the distance. My favorite wildlife surprise was the rafter of turkeys we saw close to sunset! It was also need to see people flying there model plains out there. The people watching was just as good as the walking!<//text>< pictures>

Nice ranch! Lots of beautiful wildlife. I would recommend going there but stay on trail as there are lots of snakes and I once accidentally got near one while staying on trail, so be careful there don’t go in the bushes while hiking.
There at the entrance is a parking lot and bathroom. Another nice thing is that when you get inside the rancho there is a huge plain and on it is a picnic area shaded by a large tree.< /review>

<Text>My favorite place for trail running near Mountain View. Rancho has miles of well-maintained trails, all marked with signs to keep you going in the right direction. You'll get to see a variety of plant and animal life here, from bay trees to California thrashers. Keep an eye out for interesting mushrooms, too. Got kids? They'll love the working farm, which keeps chickens, goats, and pigs. Parking can be difficult, especially on weekend mornings.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Very scenic open preserve. The entrance and parking is free compared to other state parks. The trails are well maintained and very scenic. It's a great place for evening walk and morning hike if you live in south bay area.<//Text>

Many trails, short and long, can take you up all the way to Black Mountain (about 16 miles round trip, 2500ft climb). A lot of wildlife to see, primarily deer and turkeys, some birds, and occasionally a coyote. Easy access, however parking can be challenging at popular visit hours.< /text>< pics>

As a hike, it's pretty easy. A fair amount of wildlife (mostly turkeys, other birds, rabbits, deer, etc.), and on most days, there's a nice view of the valley. Parking can be difficult on weekend mornings.<//review>

<Text>The trails were ok, but probably not enough to justify the crowd and the difficulty parking.  We arrived at 8:30am in the morning on a Sunday, and despite four large parking lots, could not find a single place to park because it was so crowded.  Then on the trails, it was filled with even more people.  It was just too crowded.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoWTF7n9pnlIcfTBZGTLcm_KSgEfwLzxKIVoBy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
From casual intensity flat trails to Deer Hollow farm, to strenuous hills on the PG&E trail, this park provides a wide variety of hiking experiences. Frequent sightings of wild turkeys and deer. Magnificent views of South Bay from several vistas.

Can be difficult to get a parking spot on good weather weekend afternoons.<//Review>

We went on Sunday afternoon! A lot of people! Recently they are making some of the trails one-way so people don’t have to run into each other. However the “one-way” instructions are a bit confusing because some of them are not one way and they might be connected to one-way trails without further instruction . We end up walking into a one-way trail with wrong direction and was very embarrassed when people come tell us that we are in the wrong direction. Beautiful scenery though!< /text>

Beautiful trails, turkeys, deer, birds, bunnies!  Various trails of different lengths.  Great views from the top.  Parking is challenging in the am...just be patient...A space will free up.< /Review>

Amazing trails around here. This place has plenty of parking (there are many lots but still you come late, you will find it hard to get one). I did the wild cat loop trail which was really good. There is a short one you can do or make it longer, depends on how much distance you want to go. The moment to trail the trails at entrance, there are maps detailing the route. I THINK you can also go to the Black Mountain through one of the trail paths!</review>

I visited this place on 09/26/2019. The trail is long and there’s a lot of sheds and trees. You can enjoy with your family specially the small farm with the kids.< /review>

The place is great for a day hike or a morning run to the top of the mountain. The first 3km are pretty flat. After that is all uphill. Trees become more scarce half way to the top so is a good idea to wear susncreen and glasses. Parking gets very crowded very early in the morning during weekends. If you want to make sure to find parking arrive before 6am. Bathrooms are located in the parking lot and water fountains are available. There is also a small farm where you can buy organic eggs and other vegetables.</review>

Nice open space preserve run by the city of mountain view. Plenty of parking (although it can be quite tough to find parking during peak park hours), free entry, some really good hikes. This preserve has something to offer for all. Deer hollow farm and small hikes for the young ones. PG&E and black mountain for anyone looking for a longer hike. High meadow Vista point hike if you want a quick hike for the day. Almost always spot deer and turkey on the trails when we hike here.<//Text>

<Response>None<//Response><review>A few long trails. Some are uphill, and requires some good lungs! There is a tennis court 1/2 mile in on the north side on a trail and that one leads to the petting zoo as well. The trails uphill are long and it's best to do them in the early AM...when it's not so hot. It can get VERY hot there. Not alot of tree cover on many areas on the trails. They have bathrooms by one parking lot only. We have seen a rattle snake there and bunnies, wild Turkeys etc.Views are great over the valley when up on the trails. Nice few hours in the woods. For being in CA, it's not too bad! Bring LOTS of water!< /review>< Pictures>

Its beautiful to be sure and lots of chances to see different wildlife at a leisurely pace, but the limited parking compared to the massive numbers of potential clientele makes the parking a nightmare. If you don't go early, especially on weekends, you'll end up stalking parking spaces for leavers for ages.<//Text>

Absolutely a running/walking heaven. Anything from a cute little walk to the farm with kids to a 17miles hike/run and anything in between. They have maps when you enter so really easy to navigate and choose the right route for you. My favorites are: to the farm and upper Wildcat for about a 7 miles loop. Enjoy!<//Text>

I really enjoy this trail. Easy to get to. Lots of parking. Good trails. Not a ton of people.

Let's start from the beginning. Parking. This reserve has a lot of full sun areas so most people are here before 9am on weekends. They have multiple lots, but the bottom most lot is the largest and is closest to the reserve entrance and bathrooms. The closer to 9am you get there, the harder it'll be to find a spot.

As for the trails itself, wear trail running shoes or sneakers you're okay with getting dirty. It's all dirt paths. Also watch out for horse poop.

Bikers are allowed in parts but dogs are not. Parking is also free.

They have bike lanes but they're not labeled well so everyone just walks wherever. It's never been a problem when I've been there though because the paths are wide.

As for the trails itself. There's a lot of shorter ones that when combined, become longer hikes. We've always gone to the lookout points so you get a 4 mile uphill climb to about 1000ft, then 4 miles back down. You can combine some so they're 11-13 miles if you want something longer or more difficult. Same with the other way around. You can stay on the flatter beginning path for an easier walk.

As for the sights, they got it going on. Lookout trails have beautiful views. Tons of nature, hills and views like the Apple donut campus, NASA building and redwood City salt mines (are they mines?... Lake?...)... They also have goats. So that's cute.

Most trails are part sun and part shade so wear breathable clothing, hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen. I've definitely seen some women wearing very little because of the heat, but they're beat red and don't even realize how burnt they are.

Trails are pretty wide for the most part. A few spots where we walk single file because of hikers coming the other way. These are not trails for strollers. If you bring one, stick to the easy flat part only, don't attempt the harder hikes because of the elevation.

They have bathrooms at the lowest level parking lot, and two portapotties further in on the flat area. No bathrooms higher up.

Overall, it's a really nice hike that's quiet and challenging but not too long. I also like that the first half is uphill while the second part is downhill. I've definitely done it the other way and that's less fun.</review>

Be sure to go on a week day morning if you want a parking space. Trails get busy on weekends, sometimes with large noisy groups and even some people carrying mini-boom boxes while hiking. If all you want is a noisy place to walk please spare the rest of us the noise and go to the mall. Let the rest of us escape from the hustle bustle of city Life and enjoy the peace and quiet of nature.<//Text>

I have been there twice ! It is always fun to go there with friends or family and have experiences together. It is recommended if you have never been here. Good to be out in summer to have a great picnic and fun with family. Water rides are amazing too. Park is huge and can keep you busy the whole day.<//review>

Usually ultra-crowded in the weekend, and hard to find parking if you go there after 8a. There are many trails, for all levels. Bring your bottle full of water with you though, because you won't find any fountain if you get half mile away from the parking lot<//Review>

<text>Great trails here, yet too many people on a weekend. Stick to higher elevations and steep trails to avoid the crowd. Nice flat garden area with animals. Check out the goats! Parking can be a challenge.</text></record>

Come here often. Love that there are flat trails along with longer, more difficult incline trails. Cute farm for kids (and adults!). Parking is difficult to find but worth the effort.< /Text>

Great for hiking.  Watch out if your car is parked in the lot after park closes.  You will get a ticket.  Deer Hollow Farm is a sweet spot for farm animals.<//Text>

I have been hiking in the Bay Area for years and Rancho San Antonio remains my #1 place to hike. They have 3 parking areas but they can fill up on weekends and holidays causing you to have to wait for people to leave. There are a number of trail options but hiking to the top via the PG&E trail gives you the best workout and the best view. The trail has a good amount of shade so even on the warmest days you will get some relief. If you hike early enough you might see some deer and wild turkeys. There are always a good number of people there so you won’t feel as though you are out in the wilderness by yourself.< /Review>

A convenient park for elevation and distance training. Quick one-hour loops to comfortable half-day hikes. Preferable to Mission Peak for hot and cloudless days thanks to shade on many stretches of trail. The animal farm is a popular attraction (but not always open). Trails are muddy after rain. Reception is pretty solid throughout the park. Parking is free, but can be a challenge on swell days. Restrooms available at trailheads.< /text>

Most trails are loops and there are maps you can pick up on your way in to plan your route. I really like the Rogue Valley trail for a moderate hike, but I never get tired of exploring and trying new trails. There's a lot of parking, but it does tend to fill up - don't worry though if it says "Parking Full" when you get there, people are always leaving and I've never not found a parking spot.<//Text>< Time>

This park is one of my favorites to go for a quick hike/bike ride. It’s suitable and easy enough for all ages. There are great trails and some amazing views. Every time I go, there are deers and turkeys roaming around everywhere.
There are multiple lots for you to park at. Parking on weekdays doesn’t seem to be too bad, but on weekends I recommend getting there early (like before 8am).<//Text>

I always go running here, every chance I get. Its a great place to just get away and enjoy ones peace at mind. I've been going here ever since I was a youngster with my mom, dad, and sister.
Now I go buy myself just to run. Usually I go Thursday's and Friday's.< /Text>

Popular, expansive park... great for trail running (with challenging climbs), lots of groups hiking & running... avoid weekend mornings, unless you get there pretty early... you'll be driving around a while looking for a place to park...the 5(!) parking lots fill up quickly.  Family friendly animal farm on-site, with cows, goats, ducks, and hungry chickens (which they let older kids feed).  Docents around to educate you.  Yes, cows are really huge up close...</review>

<Review>It's an awesome outdoor loci where it has something for everybody. I see folks flying drones and model planes on the upper fields next to a paved parking area. As you drive down the road l, there're more parking spots; and there's a public restroom in the middle of the parking lot that I consider clean and no signs of drug use. Rangers patrol this area quite often, they're knowledgable and eager to help. There are multiple trails but every one but the Black Mountain Trail (high elevation gain) is easy. Not into hiking? No worries. There's an animal farm in the area too so everyone is welcomed!</Review>< Time>

Such a wonderful place to hike. There are flat trails that are good for strollers and more inclined trails if you want something harder. I've only gone with my baby so I've stuck with the easier hikes, but it looks like there's plenty for a real hike.

My son loves seeing the turkeys and deer wandering around.<//text>

We love this park where it has nice hiking/running trails.  It is kids friendly park where there is Deer Hallow Farm which is a petting zoo and open for everyone. There is a hiking trail of round trip around 4.6 from parking lot to the Vista point. The Vista point has a nice view looking towards south Bay.  Park is very beautiful and green, especially after the rain.</text>

Very nice hiking trail with well preserved nature. Combine some trails, we can make different length and difficulty level trails. Along the trail, we can see many insects, lizards, deers and wild  turkeys.  Around farm gets a bit crowded with many children. It is nice working farm and number of farm animals out all the time. There are a few parking areas, however so many people visit the park, parking can be challenge especially on weekends.< /Review>

A great place to hike, with a nice view of the town from the top. There is a small farm at the bottom of the field, which houses sheeps, goats, hens, and rabbits. The hike has some shaded and some non- shaded areas, so it could be a little sunny on a hot day. Overall, it is a great hike!< /Review>

If you come before 4 pm you get to interact with farm animals. That's always fun for kids and adults alike. There are plenty of hikes for all levels. To top it all, we almost always encounter deers, brush rabbits, California quails, and turkeys.</Text>

This is a beautiful place for hikes, picnics, runs, bike rides with family and friends, weekends and weekdays. Hide up to Vista Point from the many trails options, and see a great view of the valley. Even SF and Oakland are visible on a clear day. You can see deer, squirrels, lizards, rabbits, snakes, turkeys, and bluejays. Bobcats and mountain lions have also been sighted. The farm is great-pigs, goats, cows, herbs, flowers. This place is on my favorites list. Parking can be hard but with patience, you can get a space.</Text>

I love the trails BUT hate parking here. People will just wait at an enterence until a spot opens up and cause everything to back up. I wish they have better security circling around to make people move or have signs that say no waiting/stopping. I would just park on the streets and walk all the way to the trail. It's far but at least you don't have to deal with that.< /review>

To be honest, I have known Rancho San Antonio since childhood and the park has always served quite a few purposes. I never really used the tennis courts or the exercise structure but I have heavily relied on the decently sized flying field and the brilliant hiking trails that this park has to offer.

I wish I could give this place a 5 star review but ever since they added the strict rules and regulations for the flying field, it never was quite the same as it was for decades on end.< /Text>

Such a beautiful place I kinda hate to tell everyone how nice it is because I'd like to keep it a better secret.  If you want the perfect place to get out of the city without driving for hours this is your place.  Great clean tails with and without elevation,  some paved and some dirt.  Great for hiking, biking, picnicing and mostly relaxing.  There's a nicely mowed grass airfield with wind velocity and wind socks for flying your model planes,  helicopters or drones.  Public bathrooms are available at the beginning of the trails and more just after Deer Farm where the is a petting and viewing area of all the animals.  Parking is the only down side. And it's not terrible.  Early in the day and later in the day it's never a problem. I'm just thankful they haven't wiped away more nature to pave more parking.  If you enjoy the outdoors this is your place... but don't tell anybody else let's keep this gem a secret!<//review>

Very shaded trail (Rhus/Creek trail). If in spring, go fully covered. Nice parallel coverage to stream. Very green.
Parking is limited to say 10 cars, so go early</Review>

Great spot to check out nature, free, and free parking. What more to ask for in life? We hiked the trail with a 3 year old and he did fine. Also, we hiked all the way to the farm. Live animals, free to visit. Fantastic.<//review>

December no one is there, April crowded! Can be hard to find parking and the trails can be packed. After 2 miles you will be free of the crowds, and more than likely see me.</review>

I could use a better map. It most likely me but I get lost a lot. Take kids but keep their bikes on the paths you do not want to run over a poor little snake. Stay on paths and you will have no problems. It has a great area and people flying planes and drones. I recommend this park highly never gets old.<//Text>

I've been here a couple of times and I always love it. It's a nice hike through the trails and when you get higher up you can see a lot of the silicon valley. You get some cool tree shade throughout a part of the hike on the wildcat loop trail.There are bathrooms & water fountains at the very last parking lot.  Keep in mind though that the parking lots get pretty full especially on the weekends.< /text>

There is an abundance of wild life as well- wild turkeys, predatory birds, salamanders, deer and maybe, hopefully not though, mountain lion. Bring water. Bring vibes. Bring family. Being your horse even.< /Review>< Pictures>

I live right near the park and it is a dream come true. I do hikes ranging 4 miles to 8.5. I have memorized the trails in this park. I was hiking an someone asked me for directions and I led them straight where the wanted to go. It is a beautiful place. I am so blessed to live in a town with such a beautiful space to take a leisurely walk or a hard-core uphill hike. Rancho is an amazing park and I hope I will be able to enjoy for years to come.<//review>

Took our kids here a few times and it's always a fun time. From spotting wildlife to checking out Deer Hallow Farm and climbing on trees the whole family is entertained. There are multiple hikes and a wide variety of difficulty which is great as if both kids are on foot we stick to flat ones that they can handle. Highly recommend checking it out!<//text>

<text>Nice, shady trails. You can do a short farm loop, or long hikes with beautiful views. The farm has pigs, goat, sheep, etc.
Parking situation is not great in weekends even though there is a lot of parking since it's a very popular spot. Arrive early morning or around 1 PM to find easier parking.</text>< pics>

This place is great.  Excellent hiking trails. Both easy and harder trails are available.  This is a great place to take kids.  You can hike a little and stop at a small farm to see goats, pigs, chickens and other small animals. Lots of open space.</text>

A remarkable park!! Lots of different levels of hikes, there's one for every skill level. Parking lot to farm - great for toddlers, go past farm towrds wild cat loop trail - beginners but make sure you turn back before the hills, mid level you can go up the hill but turn back before the last extremely steep hill. PGE trail (Abbors trail) - a difficult hike but even there you can turn it into a mid hike but crossing over near the first electric pole on hike, but if you continue make sure you really are used to a difficult hike. TAKE WATER!!

The views of the valley are spectacular with a lot of photo ops if you are into that.< /Review>

A great place to go trail running, be prepared to encounter plenty of walkers here. Can connect to other parks to create a long distance course if you take the proper trails.< /text>

It's crowded because it's so convenient. The trails are are hilly and full of people; kids on bikes or kids running around, adults walking in groups, etc. It is very hard to find parking here; Uber or bike or show up at dawn, or just go somewhere else. Deer Hollow farm is in a canyon that is 10 degrees colder than the surrounding area so bring gloves and extra layers in the winter if you get cold easily. You can usually see deer here and sometimes turkeys. There are some views of the South Bay if you hike a few miles.</text>

<review>The open space preserve is adjacent to the Rancho San Antonio county park. Lots of easy hiking trails through pretty terrain. Look for deer, coyote, and occasional mountain lions. Parking is very difficult on weekends, so come early if you must bring your car. Bicycles are not allowed on dirt trails.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<review>Beautiful and extensive trails offering an open feeling with plenty of sunshine. Lots of trail options to appeal to a broad section of population. You can go rugged and do hills or opt to stay on flat paved walks. Plenty of miles. Very popular so parking on weekend mornings are nearly impossible past 9:3am.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Went to the park on a long weekend, it was very crowded but we managed to get a parking spot in a few mins (feels easy enough to get a spot anytime). I personally liked it much better than going to mission peak. Beautiful trails and lush green grass amid some tree line made it a nice and easy hike. Most of the trails are flat except a couple of them.< /Text>

Loved coming here for a hike with a friend and by toddler. Great retreat away from the busy lives of the silicon valley. Can't believe it is so close to the hustle and bustle of city life. I only walked on the east route but saw so many options for those who don't have a stroller. Restrooms were clean. Parking is hard to get but I got lucky on a weekday. Spotted 20+ deers so close to us. My toddler loved seeing the sheep and goats too.</review>

Rancho San Antonio is a preserve that combines both accessibility (it is right on the border of Los Altos/Los Altos Hills) and enough miles of trails to pack in a serious hike for the day. You could hike nearly 19 miles from the main parking lot up to Black Mountain and back, or you can exit the preserve at Hidden Villa and get ferried back from Moody Road to your car. The main area, within a mile of the parking lot and the Deer Hollow farm can feel crowded on weekends, but start hiking out a mile, and you'll start to find the solitude enjoyed by most serious hikers.< /review>

Great walking trails through open and wooded areas. Deer Hollow Farm is fun and educational for young kids, with goats, sheep, cows, pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese on view. Parking is ample, but everyone wants to park in the lower lot, so if you're there during busy hours save yourself some aggravation and just park in one of the upper ones.</text>

Great place for a workout. I've been here multiple times. It can be very busy on weekends and after work. Good for a hiking workout and parts of it are good for running. There are shady spots, which is where I happen to see a few rattlesnakes, otherwise lots of areas of no shade and hot. Bring some water.</review>

Great open space preserve, but not a lot of shade. Miles of trails and beautiful views while on your walk. There is ample free parking and bathrooms that are a little stinky.  There are water fountains to quench your thirst. I recommend you go early while it is cool.<//Text>

Beautiful, well-maintained trails. Accessible wildlife and breathtaking views. The only drawback of this preserve is the parking. You need to arrive before 7a if you are going to find a spot without stalky some existing spots, waiting for them to open up</review>

There is something for everyone here and it is just one of the many reasons this is a much better place to go than Mission Peak or Communication Hill. It is outdoors in a scenic area and the trails are well maintained. Just don't go after it rains. The trails very in length such as moderate trails like Wildcat Loop or much harder ones such as the PG&E trail. Although if you do the PG&E trail on a clear day you can see San Francisco not to mention the abundance of wildlife from deer to snakes.< /Text>

<Review>Wonderful place to hike. Parking can be difficult during busy times, mostly on weekends and holidays, in the morning. If you get an early start, you're fine. We usually do the Wildcat Loop, about 6-ish miles. We love it!</Review><Name>Nancy Moser< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Tons of great hiking that is super convenient if you live locally! There are definitely more scenic hikes out there, but it's hard to expect too much when it's surrounded by South Bay suburban sprawl. Still, I really like hiking here, and if you're willing to take the time to go further into the hills, there are some trails where you feel like you really are getting away and out into nature. If you live nearby, check it out!</review>

I was really surprised at how much wildlife I saw along the trail.  Humming birds, quail, rabbits, chipmunks, lizards, mice, cool blue birds, and the list goes on.  The trails are very well maintained if not a little too wide.  Plenty of room to stretch your legs, but not enough room to escape the rude groups of people who think the trail is the perfect place for loud conversations.  It also seems impossible to get away from the buzz of high tension power lines in this area.< /Review>

<Review>It is the closest open space to Sunnyvale. It has several vista points where you can see the bay area. There are many trails with different distances and difficulties.
You can hike all the way to the black mountain peak, which is 8 miles one way. You can also pick an short easy trail.
There are many runners running on the trails in the afternoon and evening. Trails are not that wide. Please always stay on right.<//Review><user_name>Lake X< /user_name>< gmap_id>

Awesome nature here. It's not at all uncommon to see free range turkeys, deer, quail and of course lots of ground squirrels. And the farm is sure to be a great attraction for kids, with pigs, cows, ducks and chickens.
Besides the animals, the hike up towards the farm is admittedly kind of boring, lots of open space and not a lot of trees, it can be pretty brutal on the hottest days, but once you get into the forest it's quite pleasant.< /Review>

This is a nice place to hike with your family, friends, or by yourself. It's not very challenging;however, it has some steep climb at times. Remember to take the trail leading to the animal farm! Enjoy the breeze and the sound of water running along the creek, it's beautiful.<//text>

<review>No winding roads to get here. Quick drive from Central San José. We arrived around 10 am on a Saturday and the couple of parking lots they have were full but people were coming and going so finding a spot was easy. The trails are very well maintained and mostly shaded. There were children on bikes, scooters, wagons, and strollers and many elderly people, so I would say the trails are fairly easy to hike, not a lot of elevation. My 3 year old hiked for almost 4 miles with no complaints. Perfect for beginner hikers. The farm, with chickens, goats, sheep, and pigs, was a plus.<//review>< Pics>

Good place for hiking. Recommended going there early during the weekend to do d parking, because this place attracts a lot of crowds. I did the PG&E trail to reach the vista point and took the night medow trail back to the parking lot, which makes for a good 8 mile hike. I also saw some deer.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I've hiked every trail in this preserve and I will never get tired of them. The parking lot can get a little busy, but they're adding an extension to it so it'll be better very soon. Great place for running, hiking, bird watching, some horseback riding, and there's even a little farm! This is my go to place to take friends for a day hike anywhere from 2 to 16 mile loop trails.< /text>< gmap_id>

Really well maintained and nice park. Good variety of trail loops for jogging, with moderate to steep climbs. Unfortunately, it has become very busy on weekends recently and the parking situation is a joke. Arrive anytime between 8:30 and afternoon and you'll be searching for a spot.</review>

Great place for hiking, views, running.  Visit the farm (with or without the kids).  Parking a challenge on weekends. You can hike all the way to the top of Black mountain (several hours each way).<//Text>

Lots of trails, covered and open, ranging from easy to strenuous.  Also has a farm which is nice for the kids, but you have to hike to it (easy hike though!). Viewpoint on Upper High Meadow Trail is under an electrical tower and straight ahead view is restricted because of the overgrown brush but there is a bench and there is a nice view to the left and right.</Text>

Parking may be an issue as this is a very popular place. Short walk to the farm makes it an attraction for parents with young kids. You can get a good exercise on the PG&E trail. Alternatively, you can take shorter trail.</Text>

<review>It's a great place for nature lovers who hike on the 24 miles of hiking trails, enjoy the views and visit the zoo. Local residents bring their children to walk and visit the zoo. The zoo has pigs, goats and 1 cow. You also see visiting deer, turkeys and other birds and animals.</review>< gmap_id>

Multiple options here.  Good easy kids walk/bike out to the farm to see the animals and gardens on pavement or trail.  Also good real hikes up in the hills above the farm.  Plus there's an RC airstrip next to the upper parking lot, which is fun to watch.</Text>

<Text>Beautiful, gorgeous, peaceful. Totally great workout doing the full loop. Gorgeous SV views from the top. Watch out for mountain lions — be EXTRA cautious if jogging as mountain lions like that. Jog with a buddy (or five) and DONT wear headphones. Lots of animal viewing—turkeys, deer, birds. Farm is lovely and all the families with their kids is so wonderful to see</Text>< Rate>

No better place to run for hard core and casual runners. Beautiful trails, wildlife, easy trails, a monster uphill advanced hill run, intermediate runs, hiking, horseback riding, it's all here. My favorite place to run in the Bay Area (a frequent visitor from Pittsburgh).</review>

Great for the family. They have a farm house with sheep, goats, rabbits, a few cows, and chickens. There's even an open air barn for lunching. Otherwise, truly an open space that gets super hot. Make sure to check the lot down the hill for parking.</review>

<text>My family's best weekend hiking spot so far. Good views, mostly well shaded and family-friendly (there's an animal farm inside the park). There's plenty of trails to choose from, with differing lengths and difficulties. Huge (and free) parking lots and there are many amenities such as picnic areas, toilets, benches and drinking water.</text>< pictures>

A great open space for hiking, which is very easily accessible.  Lots of easy hiking trails for the kids and the PG&E and black mountain trail for those looking for a good cardio workout. The petting zoo, picnic tables and the RC plane strip make this an ideal place for outing with the kids.< /Review>

Good hike, withIn 20-30min of home, free animals viewing for kids and water stream. It has everything one require in this month to unwind from daily office routine. Parking can get tough iver weekend so my suggestion is to take whatever you get instead of trying to get closer to gate. There are multiple parking lots and last one has restrooms too.<//Text>

<review>Love this place, I go for PG&E hiking trail from this place. This place has nice little farm, where kids can see cow, chicken, turkey, Horse.
The trails is beautiful, it has many paths. One, which goes around 1800 ft high has similar cardio as Mission peak. However this trail has shades and trees not like Mission peak. One path goes by stream, that is very beautiful.< /review><username>Sandip Devnath</username><GmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e< /GmapID>< Date>

Nice park but can be very crowded and difficult to park.   There are lots of nice parks in Santa Clara County but this is one of the few with free parking and a Children's "Deer Hollow Farm."   It's heavily used by the local Cross Country teams for practice.    The model airplane flying field is one of the few places where it's legal to fly.</text>

Lots of well maintained trails, and eating areas. Noticeably free of garbage despite the large amount of children. Even when it's packed you don't feel crowded. Little petting zoo about a mile up the trail with goats and other small farm animals.  Great for trail runners, no major inclines<//review>

<review>Best hiking place near mountain view. It has an animal farm inside called deer hollow farm with goats, pigs, chickens, ducks, cows, sheep, rabbits. All it's hikes are beautiful.

<Text>Rancho San Antonio is a true hiker’s paradise right in the center of the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley! It’s huge, just under 4,000 acres with 24 miles of hiking trails. The Open Space Preserve supplies a detailed map of all the trails, get a paper map at trail heads or PDF on website (paper map larger). You can hike an individual trail or combine a few to form loops of various lengths. Most trails are people-only, but there are some that allow bikes and horses (I avoid those – marked on map). There are 3 or 4 places where you can begin your hikes (parking can be a challenge on weekends, but weekdays are easy). I usually park at the end of Mora Drive, which gives you access to multiple trails. Trails vary in challenge. An easy beginner’s loop is the Rogue Valley trail, about 3 miles. If I want more of a challenge, the Chamise Trail is good, about 5 miles out and back and takes you through the Duveneck pasture, a quiet tranquil (400 foot elevation gain). The PG&E Trail is challenging, 4 miles with a 1,600 ft elevation gain. Wildcat Canyon is a good trail, shaded mostly, and brings you back to the Deer Hollow Farm where they keep some animals. Black Mountain is the most challenging, another 1,800 feet in elevation gain after you get to the end of the Chamise trail! Be in good hiking shape and take your time! Take lots of water with you on hot days! Don’t step on the lizards! (Western Swifts are everywhere).<//Text>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Rancho San Antonio is a true hiker’s paradise right in the center of the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley! It’s huge, just under 4,000 acres with 24 miles of hiking trails. The Open Space Preserve supplies a detailed map of all the trails, get a paper map at trail heads or PDF on website (paper map larger). You can hike an individual trail or combine a few to form loops of various lengths. Most trails are people-only, but there are some that allow bikes and horses (I avoid those – marked on map). There are 3 or 4 places where you can begin your hikes (parking can be a challenge on weekends, but weekdays are easy). I usually park at the end of Mora Drive, which gives you access to multiple trails. Trails vary in challenge. An easy beginner’s loop is the Rogue Valley trail, about 3 miles. If I want more of a challenge, the Chamise Trail is good, about 5 miles out and back and takes you through the Duveneck pasture, a quiet tranquil (400 foot elevation gain). The PG&E Trail is challenging, 4 miles with a 1,600 ft elevation gain. Wildcat Canyon is a good trail, shaded mostly, and brings you back to the Deer Hollow Farm where they keep some animals. Black Mountain is the most challenging, another 1,800 feet in elevation gain after you get to the end of the Chamise trail! Be in good hiking shape and take your time! Take lots of water with you on hot days! Don’t step on the lizards! (Western Swifts are everywhere);’</review>

Great place to run. It's scenic and partially shady. There are nice hills or flat runs. There are also water fountains. Parking can be difficult though.< /review>

I wanted a hike and love elevation.  We took the 7 mile PG&E trail.  It was a good workout and gave a great view of the Bay.  There are several loops you can do if you aren't interested in the one I did.

I did it early in the morning and saw tons of bunnies as well as a few deer.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Love coming here. It has something for everyone. For families, the trails are easy to run on, and on certain days there is a small farm with goats and other animals for the kids to see.

For the runners, there's enough paths where you can leave the crowd and go on to more challenging runs. They have nice vista points to reward yourself to getting the top. Parking can be tough but not impossible, it's ok to park up the hill. You're going to be walking anyways.<//text>

I'm sure it's been said a million times already, but they desperately need more parking. The one consistency of this place is that you can count on circling for parking unless you show up at some very odd hour.< /Review>

All kinds of trails that you can think of, easy to moderate to hard, both in terms of elevation and distance. If you're a trail lover, you'll find your favorite American trail right here. Being under half an hour's drive from anywhere in the South Bay, this is a haven for all the Silicon Valley folk. Love this, and will miss it sorely if and when I do leave NorCal.< /Review>

<Text>love rancho, the only minus are the crowds on weekends. ppl get a sort of road rage when they can't find parking.. park rage? yelling, honking.. just plain rude.  lol.. kind of takes away from the peaceful nature of the area..

also, if you want a quiet reflective hike.. the popular trails are littered with large groups of ppl talking loudly and or running as well.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>When I lived in the Bay Area,  this was my favorite place to hike.   It is absolutely beautiful.   If you hike to the top of the hill,  you can see the whole Bay Area on a clear day.   However,  being a dog person.  I am disappointed that they don't allow dogs here anymore.   Perhaps too many folks let them off leash and craziness ensued?< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Hiking trails to accommodate many ability levels. Hike to the barn the first time. Then later as you develop take the pro-trails like PG&E and WildCat, it'll work-ya.<//text>

What a contrast to the gridlocked concrete torture of Silicon Valley.
Only 20 minutes drive from there, u can quickly experience that  kind of arid, almost starched beauty that reflects this region well. The hike is quite easy, with a wide mostly paved pathways snaking around the hills. The views are spectacular of the mellow landscape. Shame about the obscene electric power lines... 1 star less for that.
Honestly after a dog-eat-dog binary-focused day trapped in the tentacles of whatever tech business u slave away for, this is like sinking smoothly into a lush golden bath of melodies that stroke ur soul.</review>

Awesome park for running and hiking. Unlike other parks in the peninsula, this one allows non-millionaires to enter and enjoy the beauty of the views. Parking is really hard on the weekends so if you have time on the weekdays is the best time to go. Otherwise go very early<//Text>

<text>I enjoy hiking rancho San Antonio because of its mix of trails and the farm where you can see animals. My only criticisms of the park would be the first part of the walk is fairly boring and long to get to real trails and that parking is a pain. I feel like we find parking only 50% of the time but at least it is free.<//text><Rate>5</Rate><gmapID>0x808fb1779c15d4d9:0xc406f4b91b86595e</gmapID><response>None</response>< userid>

A staple park for the locals wanting to get out a bit without spending a lot of time driving. You can pick trails that can keep you entertained for hours. Also had a small farm with various types of animals which is popular with parents with younger kids.<//Text>

<review>Fantastic park near Mountain View. Follow the trail up for a great view of the southern part of the of the San Francisco Bay. Model airplane enthusiasts fly their planes on some days. Come early and see the wild turkeys and deer. I heard there are also mountain lions and bobcats, but only saw a bobcat in the far distance once years ago.<//review>< pictures>

I like this trail so much. Very peaceful. It has lots of shades, and the path is not too stiff so it's suitable for someone not so active like me.</Text>

<Text>Awesome place to trail run but parking is always a problem on the weekends. If that is when you plan to visit, I suggest looking for a friend or family member that can drop you off and pick you back up later.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Amazing views, good begginers hikes with well defined paths and trails. Parking can be challenging but there's a lot of parking areas. If you like nature and photography, bring your camera!< /text>

Great walking paths, lovely trails and farm with animals. Model aircraft field an added bonus and was something extra to look at. Only downside was that parking was extremely difficult, even on a midweek morning.<//review>

Five stars only based on the memory I had of going to this place around 2007 - 2009. Now, yes, I do the favor of introducing people to the dizzying number of turns and intersections of this place before cutting them loose to visit on their own, but it is no longer the weekly weekend trek of the grueling PG&E trail or just to get outside for one of the quicker, easier loops. PARKING has become a stress-inducer. People have gotten ugly. I have witnessed a parking confrontation primarily due to the arrogance of one driver and nearly became involved in one myself had I arrived just seconds sooner. Throughout the years, the grounds and trails have been well maintained, though I attribute the wider trails to people not staying within the boundaries. Wildlife sightings are hit or miss, but I have seen a banded snake, a rattlesnake that was within striking distance but luckily too young to know that I was a potential threat, deer, turkey, hares, pheasants, ground squirrels, birds of flight that I'm too ignorant to identify, and my favorite: a California Newt. So, if you don't know any better, have never been, want to get outside, need to work in some cardio, like nature's creatures, then try the place out. You'll figure out when to go so actually can find a parking spot. And people of all ages are afoot on weekends, so it really is a place for a everyone - hence its popularity.</text>

I love hiking here, the trails are beautiful and well maintained.  However, the parking situation is awful, so few spots for the size of this park.  The wealthy neighborhood next door to the parking lot, where every house has at least a 2 car garage and a driveway, has recently instituted permit only street parking which makes the situation even more frustrating.  I pay my taxes that pave your road and ya'll have more than enough space to park your Teslas and BMWs.< /Text>

For  hiking alone ,it is a good place but I found it very dry and dusty in some parts .I have been here 3 times and I feel the deer hollow farm is a good place for kids to watch domestic farm animals ..apart from that the hike is okay if not great.</review>

I very much enjoyed our hike, but parking was nearly impossible on the weekend.

Most of the walk is pretty flat and well-maintained, but there are some more challenging trails a bit further in. We ended up doing a 7ish mile loop.< /Review>

A wonderful place to hike. It gets pretty crowded weekend mornings. You can see the wild deer and coyotes if you're lucky. There are organized tours for kids about Ohlone culture. You can get an Uber to and from this place during the day.<//Text>

Best place to get fresh air and enjoy greenery. Near to Santa Clara. Getting car parking is bit difficult on weekends. But there are many lots. If you wait for 5mins, you will get one.</Text>

Good hike - many many different trails here with varying lengths / height variances! Signage was relatively good for a complex set of trails. The view could be slightly better (perhaps if I had tried a more difficult hike it wouldve been better)</Review>

<text>I was saddened by the end of our walk many years ago by the area you call the "farm". I am appalled by the breeding of the sows you have there and the cute little piglets that will have to be slaughtered for bacon on somebody's pizza. Please consider the humane route. It would be far better to save the ones who are downed en route to slaughter. Please stop raising pigs for meat! Thank you, N. Chiodo, (back to being an Oregonian).</text>< Rating>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>The trails here are well-maintained and not too difficult, so it's perfect for a relaxing hike for people of all ages. Many parts of the trails have plenty of tree cover, so don't be too worried about being sunburned. The park is super popular, so it may be difficult to find a parking spot.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Hiking with toddlers and young children under 5. If your're lucky you will see deers, quails, snakes and anyway there are many farm animals. Have fun!</Review>

Always too crowded, NO PARKING space. We had to park a mile away. I walked to the farm whit a 2 years old, anxious to see the animals and we were told that they had a found raising event and we had to pay $7/ea to get in!! REALLY!?
"How about posting a sign at the beginning of the trails going to the farm?"
That would have save me a little guy disappointment and the unfruitful walk....<//Text>

This is a very special place. I hope it's cherished and preserved for many generations.<//Text>

It's a good place to take kids, there are easy hikes (long walk) and a fun farm to visit.  Parking was very crowded and it took half an hour of circling, so carpool if you're going in groups.</text>

Easy access to the South Bay and Peninsula for some good nature time. At certain times of day it is crowded and loud and detracts from the beauty of the Area. Try to go when there are less people.< /Text>

Too busy! The Cupertino crowd fills this place on the weekends. I rather get further away from the city.<//Review>

If you can find parking, there's many trails and activities to choose from. The lower trails and loops are packed with families/strollers/bikers. BUT YOU CAN'T ENJOY ANYTHING IF YOU CAN'T FIND PARKING. I've turned around and left multiple times because of lack of parking and overall overcrowding. Maybe an entrance fee would help?<//review>

(Translated by Google) A very nice place to enjoy with the family.
You can go have a picnic, you can ride a bike, you can walk or run.

There are various animals, and various paths to choose from.

They have several parking lots but they fill up so you will walk around until you find one.

They have toilets.

The place is clean.

What I recommend is to put more garbage cans in the canine since I found several bottles of water thrown away and those harm the animals and insects of the place.

But I recommend it 100%

Un lugar muy bonito para disfrutar en familia.
Puedes ir hacer un picnic, puedes pasear en bicicleta, puedes caminar o correr.

Hay varios animales, y diversos caminos para elegir.

Tienen varios estacionamientos pero se llenan así que vas dar una vueltas hasta encontrar uno.

Tienen servicios higiénicos.

El lugar es limpio.

Lo que si recomiendo es poner mas tachos de basura en el canino ya que encontré varias  botellas de agua tiradas y esos dañan a los animales e insectos del lugar.

Pero lo recomiendo al 100%<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a good place to be with children. There is also a course where you can enjoy more than an hour of trail while you are pulling a stroller, and you can climb the mountain and see the Silicon Valley. There are deer farms in the middle, and there are many people who can see sheep and pigs. There is also a place where you can eat lunch in the middle, so it is a good place to take lunch and hike.
The parking lot is quite wide, but there are a lot of people, so when I arrived at 12 o'clock, it took about 10 minutes to park. At 2 o'clock there were more than 10 cars waiting. Please refer to parking time ~

아이들과 함께하기 좋은곳입니다. 유모차를 끌고도 한시간 이상의 트레일을 즐길수 있고 등산을 해서 실리콘밸리를 조망할수 있는 코스도 있숩니다. 중간에 사슴농장이 있는데 양과 돼지 소 등등을 볼수있어서 사람들이 많이 있슺니다. 중간중간 도시락을 먹을수 있는곳도 있어서 도시락을 챙겨서 하이킹 하기에도 좋은 곳입니다.
주차장은 꽤 넓지만 사람도 엄청 많아서12시에 갔을때 10분정도 주차가 걸렸고 2시에는 10대 넘는 차가 대기하고 있었습니다. 주차시에 참고 해주세요~</text>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful place to walk! Lovely livestocks in Deer Hollow Farm. Great scenery at a vista point.
A pleasant place to stroll and climb. When I visited in early May, I had plenty of parking space. There were quite a few people but it was very easy to walk. The scenery is beautiful, and you can see livestock such as sheep, goats, cattle, and chickens when you visit the farm. Be sure to visit Deer Hollow Farm. It takes 20 to 30 minutes from the entrance to the farm.
Wild turkeys are easy to see. I could see wild deer or rabbit, but I could not see it. If you climb the Vista point for 30 minutes on the farm, you can see the view from Mountain View to San Jose. There are many people who come to the stroller because the road is wide and flat. The vista point on the farm is not steep, but there is a little slope and a narrow section.

Beautiful place to walk! Lovely livestocks in Deer Hollow Farm. Great scenery at a  vista point.
산책하고 등산하기 쾌적한 장소. 5월 초에 방문했을 때는 주차할 곳이 넉넉했음. 사람이 꽤 있었지만 길이 넓은 편이라 걷기 편했음. 경치도 아름답고 농장에 방문하면 양, 염소, 소, 닭 같은 가축을 직접 볼 수 있음. Deer Hollow Farm은 꼭 방문하길. 농장까지는 입구에서 20~30분이면 도착.
야생 칠면조는 쉽게 볼 수 있음. 야생 사슴이나 토끼도 볼 수 있다고 하는데 보지는 못했음. 농장에서 30분 정도 등산하면 나오는 Vista point에 올라가면 마운틴뷰부터 산호세까지 전경을 볼 수 있어서 아름다움. 농장까지는 길이 넓고 평탄해서 유모차를 끌고 오는 사람도 많음. 농장에서 vista point는 길이 험하지는 않지만 경사가 조금은 있고 길이 좁은 구간이 있음.<//review>

<username>Sveta Baimukhametova<//username><review>(Translated by Google) Great vacation spot with the whole family. Huge area. And almost in the city. You can get acquainted with wild animals and domestic animals. You can ride bicycles and even horses. We saw deer, heron, wild turkeys, a lot of earthen squirrels. Maybe not enough benches. Parking is problematic at the weekend.

Прекрасное место отдыха всей семьёй. Огромная площадь. И практически в городе. Можно познакомиться и с дикими животными и с домашними. Можно кататься на велосипедах и даже лошадях. Видели оленей, цаплю, диких индюшек, много земляных белок. Может маловато скамеек. Парковка проблематична в выходные.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Moreover, the course is diverse and it seems that you can enjoy trail running. However, as I went deeper into the mountains, the number of people decreased, and there was a mountain lion sign, which made me a little scared. There are bears in Japan as well, though.

(Translated by Google) It is an excellent place where you relate a lot about nature and especially being with animals and listening to the songs of the animals that live there.
