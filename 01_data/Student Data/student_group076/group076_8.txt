<Review>Now that the stores are back open, you still can't go in and look at any products. The employee (manager?) that came out to talk with me was very nice. He gave me a sheet of paper with a phone number and the note to call LOYALTY TEAM to disconnect the line to my Chromebook which fell apart after one month and I had to return to Samsung but there's no such thing as a loyalty team and I still had to wait a half an hour on the phone for someone to answer.  The phone number listed here is not answered by people in the store and it goes to the Verizon customer service where you again wait and wait and wait and wait for someone to talk to you.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1598824386213, 'text': 'Thanks for sharing your review, Carol.

Drove to this corporate store as recommended by 2 other stores located in different towns.  Sales people said open hours were in place until 7pm.  We rushed to Citrus Heights only to have the door closed and locked as we tried to get hrough door at 6:30pm, without an explanation.  I stood at the door anyway.  An employee approached the door laughing that they were closed.  I explained I just needed a return envelope so I could return my trade-in.  She stated nowhere does it indicate in their advertising that the open hours are until 7pm.  It actually states it everywhere, even on the voicemail when I called the store to speak with a manager at that moment.  Incredibly rude people.  I will not be going therea gain and will consider dropping my 22-year patronage.  Zero stars would be given, if possible.< /review>

Everyone working in this store is very kind and professional. They did all they could to help as I was trying to help my parents with their existing account and getting new phones.

Unfortunately there is only so much they can do in store. Most things need to be taken care of through calling the support line. Each of my 3 calls had over a 30 minute initial wait time and then more time on hold as I was passed along to the person who could help. All of them were kind and helpful, but I finally needed to switch carriers to find the type of in store customer support and phones that will work for my parents.<//Text>

<Name>Jada Hayes</Name><Text>We had the worst experience with Verizon yesterday and this store and workers literally offered no solution except go to an authorized retailer or wait four days (since it was the weekend) for the phones to be shipped. Found out we couldn’t even go to an authorized retailer because the promotion we wanted could only be through a corporate store. We couldn’t wait for the phones to be shipped either as my phone had stopped making and receiving calls two days prior. Also called the 800 number provided to be told we couldn’t pick the phones we wanted up at any store within 50 miles because there wasn’t a corporate store for pickup yet we were standing right at this corporate store. All of this happened after credit was already ran for the phones. We eventually gave up on Verizon and went right down the road to AT&T, received excellent customer service and left in under an hour with the exact two phones we originally wanted from Verizon but for even cheaper. Thanks for nothing Verizon and thanks for everything AT&T. After this experience we will definitely discourage anyone we know from going with Verizon. Poor customer service.< /Text>< GmapID>

I bought a new phone from Verizon Wireless online two days ago.  Was having problems getting phone activated and information from old phone to new phone transferred over.  Looked up the closest location which happened to be the Birdcage Mall location.  Was told that they don't assist with setting up and activating phones.  So now I'm paying for service yet I can't set up my phone.</Text>

This is a corporate store. Spoke to a gentleman by the  name of Thomas C., and highly recommend him. He was very patient and took the time  to make sure I got the right phone for my usage. He even helped get my phone number ported over. It was clean, well lighted, and well stocked. They even have some Google products. He would have been happy to sell me a prepaid phone or one that was on a contract- it did not matter.<//Text>

I will be honest though, coverage and internet speed is slower than I expected. Is there a reason for this?<//Review>

This is for Michael, whom didnt want to honor the list price of iPads on display today while we added to our plan. He claimed it was from black friday specials, which was a full week ago. I said can you ask your manager, he came out saying "are you sure you want to honor that", to the manager, who said yes. When he came over he now tried saying that wed have to buy a phone in order to get that price, or pay 50 more for the actual price its supposed to be, which seemed to be a total lie and made up. He immeditely took the label off of the iPads once I told him no thanks and didnt want to waste anymore time! I doubt he'll last long with how unhelpful he is, I know he wants to save his daddy's money by not honoring prices listed, even when asked why there were no fine prints saying restrictions apply, to indicate a phone would need to be purchased for that price, his response was just that the label is very vague and that hes here to explain, which hes there to not sell it looks like. If a manager says go ahead I'm not sure why hed make up stories but I didnt want to stay any longer and had to leave. Unreal.</text><rating>1</rating><userid>116823490170488668583</userid>< resp>

Employees don't know anything. Data speeds seem slower than T-mobile, and phones are so full of bloat ware that you just want to throw your phone. I have no idea how Verizon is still number the number one cell phone carrier.< /text>

Depends on who you get to work with. Some people are VERY nice and helpful, others are actually douchey pieces of crap I personally wouldn't employ. To each their own of course. Oh and I've never been here when it isn't busy, which seems to feed the employees taking their damn time with each customer. 'Oh we're gonna be busy anyways, just let em wait' seems to be the attitude. Oh well, still most convenient store to me so..<//review>

<text>The may have the "best coverage area, but their customer service is the worst. I broke my moto e screen. So I went on line to Verizon to buy a new one the same model. I found it on best buy website and bought it. I paid for my plan before the change and was not told you can't transfer the funds to your new phone. But it didn't matter. I went to best buy to have it exchanged for one that works. They refused because it was past 10 days. I didn't know this. Then they sent me to Verizon. They refused to exchange it and told me to go to Motorola. This is not customer service! This is passing the buck! I was so frustrated with Verizon I told them to keep the phone. And stormed out of the store. Angry & majorly dissatisfied. This is the perfect way to loose new customers like me. And existing customers too. #majorverizonfail<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

My girlfriend and I went in to get help with her  prepaid account with Verizon. Her phone service was shut off and we came in to get help paying more money to upgrade her plan to 7g of data/month. The man we spoke with us was not very helpful and very rude. Verizon is by far my favorite service provider, but the customer service at this location is terrible.< /text>

< Review>
I wouldn't give this verizon store a star but I have to so I can share this review. Stay away from this verizon store at Birdcage!!!  My father who is 78 went in this store looking for a phone for traveling and emergencies only. He came out with a flip phone, hum, and adaptor with a 2 year contract.  I called verizon customer service about my father’s purchase.  The customer service rep said to bring the phone back within 48 hrs from the purchase date and he would be able to return his phone/hum/adaptor without any charges. When we arrived at the store the service rep did cancel the contract and we were able to return the phone/hum/adaptor, but not without a restocking fee of $35 each.  I asked the verizon rep if they could waive the restock fee because of my dad’s age and with him not understanding what she was selling him at the time.  She said she would have to talk to her manager.  She walked into the back office and within 30 seconds returned with a, “sorry, we can’t do that.”  So my dad paid the $105 to return the equipment that they removed from the box and set it up for him.  It was an expensive lesson for my father.  I have heard other horror stories of this store from co-workers and acquaintances and even the other Verizon stores say that this store gets so many complaints all of the time.  Because of their ethics, I would suggest, keep any elderly person, if not everyone you know away from this place. If you are looking to upgrade by trading in your old phone to help pay for your upgrade, they will try to get you purchase accessories with your phone credit. Their ideology is for you to use that phone credit for accessories not for the upgrade.<//Review>

<review>This Verizon store unfortunately reflects my experience with not only other Verizon stores , but the company as a whole. I would have to write for hours on my negative experience with Verizon, so I will try and keep it short. First off this store location has an arrogant and condescending manager and staff 95% of the dozens of times I came in. I have been told / sold to and made choices, only to be told later that the rep was violating Verizon rules...but that does not matter because you the little guy will have the eat it. 2nd They sale you on a  buy one get one free phone and but good luck on the 792 dollar rebate. Every time I call into rebate center, they have an excuse why they didn't send it...from strangely my zip code showing as New Jersey,  where the "rebate is invalid" ,even though my copy sent it has my CA zip, to the new added line showing Verizon did a number change instead of a new number, even though it is a new number and an added line, which was a part of the criteria for the Bogota offer. I have spent virtually dozens of hours on the phone with dealing with billing problems and one 4 hours on the phone with the rebate problem...yet they are charging extea fees according get to Verizon because of the cost of "customer service" man hours! Go figure, you can't collect a dime when their sales people cause you financial harm and it takes a day off work and all day on the phone to fix it. (And still not fixed)  3rd. The plans are changing so often and are so confusing, partially because the plan is according to the sales person who is interpreting wrong at best and in some cases "working the Verizon system" to make the sale. When you make a choice based on what the rep is telling you only to find out he lied and this compounds other problems you already may have, they can not handle it...combined problems from their creation of what seems to be purposeful chaos,  is too many levels deep for anyone who already is acting arrogant and condescending. So it appears that companies, like Verizon, make out like robber barons because "Money Out of Chaos" works for them. As soon as I possibly can, I will be leaving this company, it maybe sooner because the rebate is still not in my hands, soon they will be eating a very big bill. The phones $1600 in phones will be kept as collateral until they pay the bill I send them for consuming massive amounts of time, causing great stress and not honoring the apparent lies and bad sales the employees make. It is just a matter of time before everyone has to experience such a horrible company and they take their business somewhere else. When Google (such a stellar top notch company and the Google shrine with candles in my bedroom has nothing to do with it) rolls out with their worldwide cell and Internet service, they will be putting all these robbers out of business. In my opinion, Avoid Verizon like the Black Plague...this is my experience and may not be everyones and does not reflect the handful of great people who have went above and beyond to fix any problems. This reflects the company as a whole and the employees that support such bad service, attitudes lack of abilitiy to correct issues and the pursuit of money at the expense of people at a level that would make the worst NY slum lords look like Mother Teresa.< /review>< Pictures>

<Name>Suren Divanyan< /Name><Text>I have been paying $240 a month to Verizon for what I thought a superior service.  This Verizon store has shattered this believe with employees who are horrible at listening and helping. The staff here cannot tell if Verizon sim card works or not. I had to go to apple store to get my iPhone checked and sim card tested on another phone and comeback so that Verizon employees can properly register a sim card. When tried to bring this issue up with Umar who works there, instead of listening he started coming up with excuses. I had to get to manager to finally make them understand that Verizon staff should be smart enough and trained enough to tell if a sim card they installed is properly registered.

After a slight kerfuffle with my to go order and speaking to the manager I decided against giving them a bad review. Got home... although not perfect as it was the original time I sat down and ate inside the restaurant... the food was still fabulous and the flourless chocolate cake is the best I have ever eaten. Can't wait to go back.< /review>

<Review>The food was so good i had to actually make a review. Ive never had Mediterranean food before but i started working at a different post office so I decided to try it out and they did not disappoint. The employees are really nice, a woman gave me some really good recommendations on what to try ;) Worth checking out.<//Review><time>1601433551524<//time><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x80c2bda4b39d7c49:0x9d37dee94515e7f9</GmapID>< name>

<Text>Delicious selection of fresh meats, salads, and many Mediterranean favorites. The dishes are flavorful and the portions are very generous for the price. The staff is warm and friendly and their homemade lemonade is delicious. It's nice to have a place with so many fresh options for a change of pace.<//Text><response>{'time': 1574113272682, 'text': 'Thanks for the 5-star rating, Shannon.

The lavender latte is so good, servings are pretty big and they have limited options of fresh deserts that are different every time I go in.< /Review>

Delicious, fresh and good value. My favorite spot. Great chicken shawarma and many salads to choose from - love beets and baba ganoush. Waiting for the opening of El Segundo location temporarily closed due to covid.</review>

I thought I would stop in and try a falafel the gentleman asked me if he could take my order his name is Jamall I was thinking it's a 50-50 chance at this place is any good let's see what happens I won't say anything they asked all the right questions and I answered all the right answers I got a falafel with a little teeny sauce to go and eat it in the store front outside the falafel was unbelievably amazing Very impressed fresh and healthy<//review>

See you soon!'}<//Resp><text>I really like this place. Good quality fresh food in a simple package. Better than most offering this type of food with one exception (why 4 stars instead of 5), they are inconsistent and, even worse, restrictive with substitutions. Even more so than other similar places. Specifically, not offering fries instead of rice or fried eggplant is an issue. It's not cheap, so don't be cheap with the customer. I suggest raising the price by $.20 and offer people what they want if it's that costly to provide the fries substitution. Just my thought.< /text></record>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>They should call this restaurant Same Same since it exemplifies what all Americans with bland and no cultural taste consider Mediterranean food. It no longer astonishes me when I read the reviews of people in Brentwood and the Westside of Los Angeles consider this food excellent. The food is fresh but this is not Mediterranean food. This is Mediterranean style food for the unsophisticated palate that is widespread on the Westside of Los Angeles. I am not a Shawarma eater any longer but I have had some amazing Shawarma in my lifetime and have traveled all over the Middle East and this is not Mediterranean food. This is the equivalent of New York like pizza or cheesecake but no where close to the real thing. I had Linner with my sister at "Same Same" last night and she confirmed what we knew from our two previous experiences at this restaurant. Fresh food with no real character and definitely not real Mediterranean food.<//review>< Pics>

I ordered food and wanted additional sides. I added sides rice and falafel. I was charged $3.95 for rice and $1.95 for the falafel, in which the menu had a count of four.
I got my order and checked for correctness, but noticed that there were only 3 pieces of falafel instead of 4. When I asked about the quantity discrepancy their response was that they provide a reduced quantity because the pieces are bigger.

That doesn’t make sense - why not keep it the same size to match the quantity and price listed in the menu!?!<//Text>

They have a big variation of movies. They have reservation available.  They order more than enough movies but there is a big population around it plus its the only movie rental in the area.  Movies are 2.47 with taxes included new
Movies are one day rental and the other ones are from three days to five day rentals.  Lots of video games old and new ones.<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Seems like the comments are coming from friends and family of theirs.Especially when they say almost the same thing verbatim.I go to this store out of convenience because it's so close to me. I've had a few bad experiences specifically with the girls.On occasion they have been rude and flat out lazy one time even refusing to help.The only reason I can see that they have a job there is because they must be related to the owner somehow. The latest incident happened today.They decided to give away a movie I was wait listed for simply because I missed their call.(I had called back within 20 mins)</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>(Translated by Google) It has a very good assortment of movies. The only thing that once asked for one and told me next week arrives. And so they brought me for 4 weeks. But it was only once, from there on out I like it.

This donut shop is hands down the best donut shop in Ventura County!! I've been eating here since I was a kid. The quality has never changed. I always knew I liked them but I first realized how amazing they are when I started working. When I bring donuts in to the office people rave about them and I get requests for them. The owners are kind and always happy to see customers! It is truly a great donut shop!</text>

I have been going to this donut shop since I was a little boy, and now take my two sons 20 years later who are about the same age I was. The same owners run the shop, and the donuts remain the best I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and make the stop, it'll be worth it.<//Review>

I think I've now tried all the donut shops in Moorpark, and Donut Shop West to me is the best. They have a good selection of donuts, and I especially like their apple fritter (fried or baked) and the tiger tail. The couple that runs the shop are warm and friendly.<//Review>

Best doughnut shop in Moorpark! The couple that owns the shop is amazing! Came in look for a special doughnut and they made it happen. This is a classic CASH ONLY shop, not for the bouji people who want bacon confetti bars.<//text>

<Text>I highly recommend Maritza Fox. She is knowledgeable, has patience , and very helpful. I have learned so much from her . I’m glad I chose Fox Microblading and PMU Academy. I live in San Diego , almost 2 hours away .  I did my research from other classes closer to me , the reason I chose this academy was because you get more knowledge on line and 3 days in class . The price is affordable . Thanks Fox team for all your help !<//Text>< date>

<Review>I would definitely 10/10 recommend this academy! Instructor Maritza Fox and coordinator Alan genuinely want the best for you and want to see you succeed and they will do what ever it takes to make sure you succeed. The class is 3 days online and 3 days in class which is perfect for anyone who has a tight schedule, and wants to get into a career as fast as possible! I learned absolutely everything I need to know in the 3 days. Ms. Fox takes passion in what she does and she is amazing at it! Thank you and I will definitely be recommending this academy to my friends!< /Review><user>112670495347876704099<//user><pictures>None</pictures><Gmap_id>0x80dd25c378dd0c19:0x73dc432df42aefcf<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

Coming from out of state, I was uncertain of which Academy to attend, but I am so glad I came here! Along with her super sweet and helpful staff, Maritza also is a knowledgeable and a patient instructor with a diverse background. She implements key fundamentals of permanent makeup in her course along with her own experiences and perspective with her business background. She took care us each individually to target areas of improvement and even made herself available as a resource and mentor. I feel confident running my own business in such a short period of time. Thank you so much everyone!</Text>

And helps you with everything from A-Z I really enjoy the 4 days class even it’s pandemic, they was really curious and clean!

<review>I can now say that I am a certified Permanent Makeup Artist, all thanks to Maritza and her welcoming staff! I took the in-person microblading certification course and learned so much. Maritza Fox, the founder of Fox Microblading Academy, is undoubtedly a true professional, well experienced in her craft, helpful, passionate, and just amazing! There was so much to learn and take away from all of Maritza’s training and advice etc. I would highly recommend taking her class and starting your own beauty business journey! No regrets!<//review>< UserId.>

She is a perfectionist! My eyebrows were sparse and totally uneven when I went in. I hated waking up and feeling like I had no eyebrows. My best friend highly recommended her to me and I’m so glad she did. She treats you like family, makes sure you’re comfortable, and makes sure you’re happy with the results. Best decision ever.</review>

The knowledge that the Master Instructor Maritza shared with us is so valuable and the curriculum  was very organized and very informative.

Maritza and her team are amazing. They give you their full on attention the second you walk in the door. You don't ever get the feeling of not being able to catch up with fellow classmates since every student gets the same one on one attention fully focusing on what you need the most help with. I'll be forever grateful to have came across such wonderful people that clearly make their students success their number one priority.< /Review>

If you’re an aspiring Pmu artist looking for an amazing/informative academy stop looking because Fox is it! I have had the best experience in the class and even weeks after that I have completed the course I still have contact with the instructor Maritza Fox and she answers very promptly to any questions I may have. I 10/10 recommend this academy if you’re looking for one on one training. The Fox’s won’t disappoint!</text>

Fox Microblading academy taught me gave me everything they promised and more! Maritza is an amazing instructor who equips you with all the tools you need to succeed! She goes above and beyond to guide and support you into becoming the best PMU artist possible. The small class size and detailed instruction make for an amazing learning environment. I’d recommend her course to anyone looking to develop the skill and knowledge of the PMU industry needed to be a well rounded  professional. Thank you so much to everyone at Fox for empowering students like me to grow in this industry.</Review>

Very well deserved 5 star rating for this academy. Super clean and presentable ambiance. Maritza is the sweetest instructor ever. She wants to see you succeed so she pours her knowledge on her students with patience and love. Alan was very informative regarding enrollment. Thank you Valeria for being super sweet and helpful to everyone.  Walked in one day and in less than one week I  started the program. Thank you Fox Academy for your guidance and diligent efforts in preparing your students for the ever growing world of Microblading. Love always, Lauren.< /Text>

< review>
The microblading class was amazing. From the start of registration, Alan was very helpful and professional. I called several training facilities, which were rude and acted like I was wasting their time by asking questions, not Alan. Every question I asked was answered and he said if you have any others questions please let us know.

Maritza the instructor was absolutely amazing. She was very patient, informative, professional, and her demeanor was so inviting, it literally made me so comfortable and interested in her training. Maritza is one person and with several students in the class you never feel you did not get enough of her time. Not only does she give plenty of her time in training, she also stated if we have any questions after the training class we can contact her and she will assist us.

Being trained by Maritza will set you up to do amazing eyebrows. She is very well known in the industry, from brows, lips and corrections. Her training facility is extremely clean and her assistants are nice and helpful.

Thank you again Maritza........

Oh my God, so much to say about this wonderful academy, that words fall short., I will only say that moving from New York to California to train with them, was the best decision !!!  This academy offers much more than just learning a technique. This school prepares you to be a true PMU art professional.  I loved my instructor Maritza Fox and all her professional and friendly staff.  I recommend it 100%.< /Text>

I was fortunate enough to attend Fox
microblading & permanent make up school a few months ago.  It was the best thing I have ever done for my career. Maritza is extremely knowledgeable in permanent make up and passionate teaching others everything she knows. The Fox Academy is extremely clean and her staff is amazing, they always made you feel like family!

You won’t be  disappoint !< /review>

I have had the most amazing experience the past four days attending the microblading training course here at Fox! Maritza and Alma my instructors were SO passionate for this industry and assured they would do everything in their power to set us up for success before we go into the real world! Training was hands on, very detailed and in depth. They were always encouraging us to never give up, this experience has done wonders for my confidence and improved my skill like crazy!! I feel confident from the training/information provided in this course, making taking on this big industry a little easier on me! There are many places to chose from but I see why I had a good feeling about this one!</Text>

<Review>I would highly recommend Fox to everyone.  I know reviews are likely done when there is a complaint and when good work is done it is forgotten.  Which is why I am making this review because this place deserves recognition.  Maritza is as talented as she is kind, so is the rest of the staff.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I had a great experience taking the Microblading class. The instructor, Maritza, is so kind and informative. I felt nervous because the course is only four days but I honestly got all the information down and learned so much. Not only was the learning experience great but she offers you so many benefits after the course so you can keep practicing and improving your skills.< /Text>

I began researching schools that would help me excel in the world of permanent makeup which I find to be very passionate about because it is a technique and skill to help others feel completely beautiful about themselves. I want to help change lives of many and help them look and feel their absolute best. After countless hours of this search I came across Fox Microblading and PMU Academy where Maritza and the other staff have been nothing but welcoming and helpful to me on my journey. The abundance of knowledge and the level support is nothing short of amazing. You can tell that her heart is about making each one of her students successful.
Maritza’s experience as an instructor has led her to be successful in opening her very own school and I am grateful for that. She has taught me not only technique but everything from the Legal side to the customer service side of this industry. She is not about making a quick buck for someone to pay for school she really wants you to become the best you can be. When you are done with school do not think that she will be done with you the academy offers continued support.

Of the highest of highs, I recommend Fox Microblading Academy and PMU.</Text>

I recently attended Fox Microblading Academy and received both my Microblading/PMU and Microchanneling with camouflage certifications. Maritza, the instructor was a phenomenal teacher and really put her whole heart into teaching the material and making sure I understood all the fundamentals of the trade. She not only showed me all of her amazing transformations, but her mistakes from when she first started out and how she fixed them so that I could learn from them. She taught me how to choose the right pigments (color), determine eyebrow shapes, and execute the task on clients, as well as county health standards & regulations. I could not have been more satisfied with my learning experience at FOX and highly recommend this academy to anyone interested in the microblading or PMU industry!<//Review>

As a Student’s Sponsor, i’m very well pleased; of note is their willingness to assist students after the course, providing opportunities to improve technique & build confidence; Also the seriousness with cleanliness/infection control.  Price - very reasonable, teaching in-depth, Student - competent/prepared to succeed.</Review>

<Text>I’ve taken a few PMU courses here now and I super recommend fox microblading! I was very selective when I chose my training , I looked all over social media, had messaged private artists schools all over so cal I even considered flying to another state to maybe take some classes and man I am sooo happy I chose to stay here in SOCAL with Maritza! Not only affordable but  the class I took was very small only about 6 students so we each had that individual attention where we could really ask questions and learn step by step. Additionally the school is there to support you in the long run with not just techniques but marketing, tool selection sanitation setting up your place etc u name it! I have watched  soo many online tutorials on all permanent makeup techniques but I’m glad that I chose to go in person to fox because now I understand than no online course can replace the in person hands on training she provides!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>LOVE Fox Microblading and PMU Academy!  I have had my eyebrows, eyeliner and Needling done twice on my face and neck.

Ms. Fox, Owner has done the work and she is an absolute expert, explained every step, insisted on my comfort level be maintained plus she provides a very sterile environment.

Ms. Fox follows a strict protocol to ensure absolute safety and clean environment preventing injury and infection.

I highly recommend having work done here and you will be more than satisfied!</Text>< Rating>

<Date>1528844485078</Date><Text>Maritza is by far the best instructor out there for Microblading and permanent makeup. She is very knowledgeable at what she does, very supportive and the sweetest person ever. There is not one question that she can't or don't have the answer to. What I love about Maritza is that her goal is to help others to be successful! You don't see that often I can tell you that from my experience. I came from another school and am not happy at all. I did not learn anything from that school but not with Fox Microblading & PMU Acadenmy. Thank you so much for your love and care Maritza!

<Review>I don’t know where to start... Maritza is an excellent and a very genuine teacher. She has a lot of experience and talent and she is not AFRAID of sharing it with her students. I searched for schools online before meeting Maritza and she was the first one I met but she and I clicked right away so I didn’t even want to shop around. I started my program right away and today I’m certified!!! Thanks Maritza and team!!!< /Review>< pics>

I highly recommend Fox Microblading and PMU academy to everyone what to be a real pmu.

<review>I had an excellent experience at Fox Microblading & PMU Academy. I was trained in Microblading, Lips, Eyeliner and Skin Needling. I am very satisfied with all the great methods and extensive knowledge I received during my training.

Maritza Fox, the instructor, is a genuine, smart and supportive person. She was very detailed when providing training in safety protocol, marketing, legal issues and off course in every aspect of Microblading, PMU, and Skin Needling. Maritza was also  great in responding to any and all my concerns and questions. Maritza also provided extended time to make sure, I fully understood each subject. During practice sessions with live models, Maritza was patient and always made sure students followed and understood the importance of personal protective equipment and its use for both, the client and the student. Following all safety protocol is crucial for both the health of each client as well as each student. Her persistence in making sure each student follows all safety and health rules increased my trust towards her as an instructor and as a person.

I highly recommend Fox Microblading and PMU Academy. The facility is very clean and provides a great learning environment. The staff are very pleasant and professional. Maritza Fox is a great instructor who truly cares for her students.

Maritza has continued to encouraged me to give my best without being intimidating. She has a lot of patience and a genuine interest in seeing her students succeed in this industry. Her ongoing support is very valuable to me and is highly appreciated it.

Thanks Maritza for your great guidance and teachings!

This is my story. It's NOT just a review but a story that I will continue to tell. I am a licensed and certified microblading artist. I came to Maritza with so many questions. Even though I was already in the business I feel like there's so much more I can learn. I was debating whether I should spend the money and time to go to another school or not. Since Maritza offers an advance class I decided sign up for it.

1st and foremost, KNOW what school you're going for. Many schools are really just out for your money. You're there for a few days, in & out with very little knowledge. This is the truth, some will struggle mapping & drawing. Some will struggle with color theory. Many will struggle with marketing. This academy will cover every ounce of it. There is not one thing that will be left out. Some schools are misleading but this academy is pretty straight forward. You're not only here to learn but you will develop a relationship with Maritza too. She makes you feel comfortable, confident, she makes you feel IMPORTANT. I've never been so excited to get up every morning to come to class. I love coming back. The class is intimate so you get a lot of one on one time with Maritza. You learn several techniques, multiple ways to map brows, pigments, color theory, marketing, information on everything!!!

Now, I want to take a moment to mention about the other staff here especially her husband. I had so many questions about the business side of this. He listened to me and inform me in any way he could. Both Maritza and her husband are very knowledgeable about everything. Anyone can tell they're both genuine who truly cares about your future. They will support you even after you're finished with the courses. Trust me I know because I'm STILL HERE, soaking everything I can. Whenever I have questions I come in and I will get the help I need. I had an issue and they both have helped me get back on my feet and back in business. I'm a mother of 5. I don't have the time nor the money to invest aimlessly. This academy is WORTH IT. I'm forever thankful for their help. Now I'm looking forward to finishing all the other courses that I'm taking. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this school. I can go on and on but if anyone have any questions, I'm your go to girl! Thank you Maritza, you are truly amazing.<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I have been searching to get into the eyebrow trend.  I was so nervous , because this was my first time getting mircobalding. The students was wonderful. My eyebrows are so beautiful. Believe me when I say, they know what they are doing. They are so professiknal in every area. The whole staff was friendly. The place was so clean, I felt comfort enough to rest. Everything was wiped down properly and the sharp objects was put in sharp container.  I was so lucky to find Fox  Microbalding &PMU associations
I have alreasy set another appointment for another service. I have already been telling everyone about this place. I will be back.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Fox Microblading Academy is by far the best academy I can recommend to anyone wanting to learn how to microblade. Maritza is heaven sent. I learned so much in these last couple of days that I didn’t think was even possible. She taught me a lot of information and different techniques on how to be successful in Microblading and PMU. The atmosphere is beyond amazing from the cool, clean environment, amazing smell, very sanitized, amazing staff and overall you exit with lots of knowledge and with a mindset of knowing you can accomplish any and everything. I have trained with some of the worst trainers, I’ve wasted money, I’ve shedded several tears on investments I made for myself that went terribly wrong due to lack of training. Finally I found my place I’m grateful to call my second home. Even after leaving she is still with you, there to help you to continue to grow and answer any questions you may have. You are never alone with Maritza as your trainer. She’s so sweet and so humble. Eager to help others in anyway she can.  Train with her today and invest in yourself with her skills, guidance, and technique or hate yourself tomorrow.</text><Time>1527296970498<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><user_name>Deborah Lorea'l</user_name><gmapID>0x80dd25c378dd0c19:0x73dc432df42aefcf</gmapID><Response>{'time': 1531615149643, 'text': 'Thank you Deborah!

I honestly dont know where to start there are so many many good things about Fox Microblading Academy, coming here was the best decision i’ve could made it completly change my life, it took a different route, but love it and I don’t regret it at all.  My experience in this academy was extraordinary starting with the Maritza, her daughter Valeria and not to forget her husband they all make you feel so welcome and they so nice and very helpful with any needs you might need.  I learned so much from basics to advance techniques that just make me feel passionate about this career.  Thank you soo much Maritza for your patience, your knowledge and that passion that show in every class it just motivated me more to learn more and more and not stop i feel like this is my second home.  Another good thing about this academy is that they offer classes in spanish for all those people who can not understand english and would like to take the class in their own language. Overall this academy is amazing the enviroment so relaxing that time goes by fast and you dont want to leave.  Thank you for all the knowledge Maritza and your good advice, thank you Valeria for being such a sweet and nice person and making us all feel like queens.  I highly highly recommend Fox Microblading Academy to all those people who like to change their careers, trust me you wont regret the money you pay is totally worth it, give it a try, it it was for me i will give more than 5 stars.<//text>

Omg!! I am thrilled and beyond amazed by how AMAZING my brows look after getting micro bladed by MARINA. i work and do hair at salon ambiance right next store and when this place opened up i was excited! I got my brows microbladed about 5 years ago and they have faded sooooo Much. So it was time for new brows. I scheduled an appointment with MARINA and wow, i am totally pleased and sp happy! It only took about 2 hours total and she made me feel comfortable and not anxious i even fell asleep! I will definitely reccomend anyone who is looking to get permanent makeup to come to fox microblading.  Ask for marina or miss foxy herself ;) without these 2 girls; i wouodnt feel as amazing as i do right now! So much happier and now i dont have to feel so insecure about my brows when i wake up in the morning.
THANK YOU MARITZA AND MARINA FOR MAKING ME FEEL JUST ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS. i have my confidence back and just in time for my 30th birthday.   :)< /review>

<Text>I don't know where to start when it comes to FOX Acadamy.  Maritza Fox is a Mentor and a friend. I’ve learned so much from Maritza than I had with the previous school.  I like hanging out at her studio, whenever I’m there her husband and daughter made me feel welcome. They’re wonderful people.
I highly recommend Fox Acadamy to anyone want to invest in a new career path to get started with Fox Acadamy.  Maritza will teach you everything she knows, and she continues to nurture you after you graduate.
I can't rave enough about Maritza; she is an inspiration.  She’s a woman with a gift and mission to help her student succeed. The rest's up to you!
I love her; and her family.  Her studio is a second home for me.  I love hanging out, practicing, visit at Fox Acadamy. Yes, Maritza is that great!!!!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I recently received my microblading certification through Fox academy and the experience was everything I was looking for. I gained knowledge on subjects that I had no idea would apply to getting this career started. Maritza and her whole staff at Fox are very welcoming but most importantly they’re eager to enlighten their students on what it takes to succeed in the industry. I can honestly say I walked away with the confidence I needed to get started.<//review>

She was very kind and answered all my questions from day 1. She and her team are very friendly and with a lot of human warmth. and they make sure that one is well tended. The class is very knowledgeable and professional. Asta took another class after the Microbladin. From day one to the last day everything was better than I imagined. Maritza helps the student more. Thank God the fox academy didn't bother me. They are beautiful people. I recommend them ..

(Translated by Google) Hello, if you are looking for an academy for microblading, I recommend Fox microblading, you will love it not only because the instructor is magnificent, but also because she makes sure you understand every detail of the class, she answers every question you even have. If you have questions or doubts after the course you can talk to him at any time .. I loved it. 🧡

私はMicrobladingのクラスをうけました。講師のMaritza、その他のアシスタントの方々もとても親切で、丁寧に教えて頂きました。必要な物が整っており、清潔な施設で安心して毎日過ごす事ができました。アットホームな雰囲気、少人数制です。オンラインのクラスも音声、字幕付きでわかりやすいです。是非みなさんにお勧めします！</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>So first off I know ordering sushi to go may be a no no to some. But considering we live 5 minutes away was our exception. Then we asked for it to be made later for pick up and clearly it had been sitting for a while so they did not listen to our request they just made it as soon as we called. Then it was suppose to be a certain amount and obviously charged a tip included but yet still asked for a tip on top. We were charged an extra $15 from what the bill should have been. Food was awful and basically looked like it was thrown in the containers. No ginger included, bare minimum for sauce included. I won't continue but we will not come back and I do not recommend.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxCVx3vkMzB9pWW4wNQqYzyNlCeE5Enb8HCC8J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTm3fMcvl5ZI3jp0DLGFQYr_RhSfdgpWtP6XNK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Quaint and friendly, and probably most important......great food!  There is almost never a wait I think mostly because it is in a supermarket plaza and just not as glamorous as their competitors down the street.....but I find myself frequenting this place more often for the smaller more intimate environment, good sushi, and friendly staff. Prices are good too! Seriously I really cant think of complaint, ive always felt satisfied every time ive been.</Review>

Hon Sushi has the highest quality sushi and level of service. They treat their customers with warmth. They serve excellent, high quality, great tasting food. Everything is kept extremely clean. Large pieces of fish grace perfect mounds of sushi rice. They serve unique rolls in addition to the common staples. Everything is done magnificently well. It is such a treat when I get to go eat here. Kate and Jin run a true gem of a sushi restaurant. Hon Sushi is truly a diamond in the rough. I have celebrated Valentine's Day and my birthday here and look forward to spending other celebrations here, as well.</Text>

They're so creative and original with their sushi. Absolutely delishes. Cuisine forward with ancient traditions. The staff, one and all, are lovely. They're attentive without being intrusive and there is no such thing as, "not my table." We have been treated like regulars since the first time and now we're regulars because we're treated like it's our first time!</Review>

Service really sucks. Waitresses seat you and dont give menu. I had to ask for a menu on every visit.  We come here once a week and service always sucks. Take a long time to take order. Food is good.</Review>

This sushi place is located in a plaza with plenty of food choices . They have plenty of free parking , which is always a plus . Came to this place since wanted some all you can eat sushi . With all the great reviews wanted to give it a try.
So came in and we stood there for a few seconds,  not knowing if we go to the people or they come to us .
Finally someone seated us and gave our menus , as we were looking at the menu there was nothing mentioning the all you can eat sushi .
After a few minutes we were able to get someone, and asked if they still offer it .
So we finally decide and our items come out, and As usual their was some confusion a few times.
We got some items that we ordered, and some never came .
We also were not asked if we wanted more food or a second round . Which I'm assuming that's how they work . Maybe I'm wrong though since they never asked .
Regarding restaurants I really don't expect much , but one thing that can be really annoying is if you have a table that has all you can eat . Please come back to them ask if they are in need of more stuff .
Another thing is I really didn't appreciate the comment , one of the staff members made . After we ended up almost finishing an order that was a mistake .
It is not our fault your staff made a mistake , but I also didn't want to get charged for extra food . If we do end up eating majority of it , kindly please do not mock your customers .  Most of my reviews are pretty fair , but by mocking us I think as a business kindly please re-evaluate how you treat new customers .< /Review>

From my waitress who taught me about the Korean writing system, to being able to practice my Japanese with the friendly chefs and minding their constant humor, Hon sushi has a warm, homely atmosphere that is so rare among even great restaurants. Once I walked through that front door it was like I was in Japan all over again. I will be happily returning tomorrow, hungry for more.< /Review>< resp>

Came here tonight & it was a disappointment. We live in Hemet and driving the 2 hours wasn’t worth it. It use to be great when I lived in Monrovia. The service was horrible. She sat us down but forgot to give us our menus. We had to get up and ask for one. It took them 15 minutes to ask for our order, they burnt my sons order of sesame chicken & served my 2 year old burnt sesame chicken as well. I asked for a side of ponzu & she completely forgot I had to ask another gentleman to bring me some. They were so attentive to everyone else other than us. I’ve never been so disappointed in food service ever. I should of saved my full tank for something closer.< /text>

We came here for all your can eat sushi for around $30. The sushi was decent, nothing amazing, and the staff was friendly. We had a party of 8, and they couldn't accommodate, we had to be split into two tables. Granted the restaurant is small, but it was a little annoying not being able to talk some people.

Our group tends to get our money's worth, and the staff was happy to help in that regard. No bad looks for eating so much which was nice.

I'd come back but with a smaller party. Only if I want to stuff my face.<//Text>

<Time>1502056307944<//Time><rating>5</rating><Text>Saturday night was our are double date night, and we gave the other couple suggestions one that included Hon's Sushi. The ambiance here is perfect for those occasions, not to mention the perfect location because you can take a stroll around the beautiful downtown Monrovia. The rolls here are extremely fresh, and the waiters are attentive stopping by every 15 minutes to ask us if we are okay, or if we need a refill.
We meet up at 8PM and got seated right away, however it took us a while deciding what to eat because they have a wide selection on fresh, baked, and fried rolls, not to mention their sashimi. Finally we ordered, and while we waited the sushi chief gave us a tuna roll on the house. That actually impressed the other couple so points for us right? Haha it was save to saw the dinner was good, and they will be going back soon. As for us Hon's Sushi is our monthly sushi craving spot. I recommend the heart attack, and bryan rolls to try. You can trust me. I am an internet stranger.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

oh wow, this place not only has great food, but also superb service!

I came here for dinner, and our waiter was super friendly and nice. He had plenty of suggestions on what we should order, and he even had a few jokes to share with us!

Sushi Pizza - about 6 or 7 pieces of sushi that taste like...well...PIZZA!! it was a great combination, and I felt that pizza aftertaste in my mouth (score!)

Rainbow Carpaccio - various sashimi wrapped in leafy greens (salad)...healthy and tasty!

Garlic Crunch Roll - mmm one of my favorite rolls there..strongly recommended if you love garlic!! its garlic-y with some sweetness to it (must try)

Baked Salmon Skin Salad - omg so yummy...the salmon skin is nice and hot and crunchy! it pairs really well with the salad...make sure to order this early as it takes some time to make<//Text>

<Time>1340313203083</Time><rating>3</rating><Review>My girlfriend and I ate there several times for the all you can eat sushi. We went there during a quiet time during the day at which point "assuming the manager/owner" told me because we didn't finish a roll (we each took one bite and didnt like it) that we would have to be half the cost of the roll above the cost of the all you can eat. I explained to him that we didn't like it and he said oh well thats to bad. If i allow everyone to come in here and try things they dont like on the all you can eat i will go out of business. I kept my patience for the moment and explained to him I had ordered other rolls similiar to this one and did not like it. His response was the same. So I warned him that if he charges me for it we will not be returning and I will not be tipping his employees as the cost will not becoming out of  my pocket for this absurd rule. That was 1 1/2 months ago and we still have not been back and will not go back anytime soon. We eat sushi upwards of 3-4 times per month. You do the math on what he has lost.<//Review>< pics>

I love this place! they are very friendly and provide excellent service.  we ordered a roll they set on fire using bacardi 151!! so awesome.  i go here all the time after work and during the weekends.  it is a hidden gem in monrovia and WAY cheaper and better quality sushi than mikomi. mikomi is overpriced as hell. anywho! enjoy the sushi everyone!<//review>

A nice spot to grab a *huge* slice of pizza for a very fair price.  The owner is quite friendly and goes out of his way to have a good customer experience or have a friendly chat.</Review>

The only great thing was the food. I guess it was "dads" turn to watch over his kids this weekend, that there are two gremlin kids that take over the parlor and are all over the place you can eat peacefully. watch over your kids "dad" they can cause an accident.<//text>

I had 8-10 family member help me move and my wife suggested these guys. They have pizza that can feed 15-20. We got that pizza and it was more than enough and fresh. This place menu had it all but all I needed was the pizza. It was so big, they could make it 3 different types of pizza in one pie. I highly recommend it. The delivery time was alittle slow but it was also the basketball playoffs. So I expected that.</Text>

Best pizza place in the Bay Area. Dough tastes great and their sauce is unbeatable. Have been coming here for 20 years and will be for another 20 easily.<//review>

Solid pizza. Kinda pricey, but convenient since I live so close. If I lived farther away, I probably won't come here.< /Text>

<review>Sorry to rated a bit on the low side but there's a lot to complain about. Did appears there's always somebody new working there and you don't get the feeling that they care much about the job. The window washers are always torn up and it's hard to even clean your windshield. Paper towels are usually out 95% of the time. It's just a minimalist run operation there.<//review>< pics>

I guess it could be worse which is why its getting two and not one star. Place is gross and dirty. Wanted to get snacks but not a lot offered and they only take cash. Ew.</Review>

My 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0 got a transmission quote from AAMCO less than $2,300 including labor; 90 days warranty.  The car has already been paid off a long time ago.  It's also a family heirloom at the same time, and soon my 15-year-old is going to need learn how to drive; so it's kind of a win-win ideal situation for me at least.< /Review>

Utilized their services for a check engine light. I called many other places and their quote to just do a diagnostic test was outrageous. This is a Veteran owned company, and they were very professional and knowledgeable. They didn't end up charging me cause it was a simple fix. I will be utilizing their services from now on!<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>The guys at Aamco Oceanside were extremely helpful with diagnosing the problem with my transmission and getting me the answers I needed right away. They run a very professional business. Due to some logistical issues with my vehicle’s warranty, I ended up not having them work on my transmission. However, I would most definitely feel comfortable taking my vehicle back there for transmission and all around vehicle service. 100% would recommend.<//Review>< pictures>

Hello.  Steve and his crew did a great job.  I needed a new flywheel/flexplate.  They diagnosised it for free, called me to let me know the cost and the work involved.  He then sent me  a picture of the broken plate.  Very nice to see what I'm replacing.  He put the car back together and I was on my way.  Very nice and personal place to get work done.  Highly recommend.< /review>

<Text>Steve and the team at Oceanside AAMCO Transmission & Total Car Care did an excellent job of diagnosing and rebuilding my transmission!  They took the time is diagnose the true problems with my transmission.  They all were very kind and conscientious, communicating along the way was excellent, and assured me after the repair that my vehicle was running better than before!  Highly recommend!  A team with experts and care is hard to come by.  Thank you again.</Text></record>

<Text>I brought my Honda Accord Car into AAMCO Transmissions Total Car Care Shop for my 10 a.m. appointment with Steve this General Manager for a Free Oil Leak Inspection.
This inspection took one hour for Juan their mechanic to perform this Oil Leak Check.
Juan this mechanic did a very good job.
I set up another appointment to come back at a later date to get my Honda Accord Car repaired to fix this problem on my car.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcMkuGffSIRh1BaH4oOV9D3eeGvplJN7mpBGum=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrEa1H4ZkuYZPZFc1aZzceaSGwDzKbf6m_swrr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNz1gQ6u5IJ4KG3RFM4iki7OTsKHHIBertQ_XPo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMq6heZq08w79GaIpxlh2ScGbvebqkyIVtTfOi7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBVjh3t5Y7TSP9F9XFjC9CBf6ecEi-jVSuW1y5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3fnwYQBw-GAdy8pHDqOvz0Iy7HJ5Zv_8LK2nl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBOWDSM_sKijnmFjaURUtnrmcGmuCfXJi6WFUo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQinrhwzmSpUuxQpmEkgRl6Az9ldz6LGkaXTBT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

Ben the owner, was amazing! Steve was very nice and happy to check me in and give  me a fair price out the door. Being on a budget, I greatly appreciated both of them. Ben was kind enough to take me home while the car was being fixed. When it was ready the next morning, Ben kindly came and picked me up to get my car. I absolutely  found the shop for me!!! I trusted, and I'm very glad I did.
Thanks so much Ben, and Steve...... much appreciated  Robin</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Ben and his team at AAMCO were unbelievably helpful and accommodating with my transmission service. From the minute I called asking for a quote, I knew I could trust Ben to take care of my cars needs. It was easy to schedule a convenient time to come in. I would recommend AAMCO Oceanside for any service, I will be coming back for an oil change soon!< /text>

They were very thorough in explaining the options and the process for rebuilding my transmission. They also gave a very fair price about half what the dealer quoted. And they helped in getting 0% financing for 12 months.</Text>

I spoke with the owner Ben who was real friendly, straight forward, & kept me updated on my car. He’s got a very professional team with great service. I took my custom 1985 Buick Regal in for a bad transmission leak in the pan. Once it was repaired, they asked if I wanted to have it looked at since they noticed some late shifting which I had noticed before as well. They let me know what the problems were and what new parts were needed. I chose to have my transmission rebuilt at a reasonable price. They also had financing available, which also helped. They were done within a couple days and when I got it back I noticed right away how much smoother it felt driving and I see I have no more leaks anywhere around the transmission. These guys know what they’re doing.</text>

These guys are super friendly with a strong focus on Customer Service. There was a misunderstanding on the service I needed which resulted in them ordering the wrong fluid (the needed fluids were much more expensive). Not only did they eat the cost, they lowered my price for the inconvenience of coming back the next day. When I went back, they had me in and out with a smile. Mistakes happen, but they sure made up for it with top notch transmission and customer service. I will for sure use these guys again.<//Review>

<review>I usually never leave reviews but the professionalism and quality I received from AAMCO Transmission definitely deserves a great review. I brought my car into other places to get a quote on a repair for a transmission leak and AAMCO was able to give me a quote the was over $200 less with the same type of parts and quality work. They were also very flexible in getting work done in a timely matter. I was able to bring the car in for an initial inspection and get the transmission leak fixed the day after. If you ever need help or work done on your transmission Ben and his team at AAMCO are definitely a highly recommended place to call.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Let me say I don’t post on here much but I had to talk about a great place to have your vehicle serviced. I “had” and older work truck which was starting to act up so I took it to AAMCO for an inspection. A day later I get the bad news ( the price of the repairs) and was given a few options for payment.  The options were great and then as we talked the owner even went more out of his way to help make sure my truck was back on the road. While this is a national chain, this shop is owned by a small business owner and person we all need to support. If your car or truck is not running just right, take it hear and rest easy knowing it will be repaired properly without breaking the bank!<//text>

This place is great. Last week I did some maintenance on my vehicle and  unfortunately it broke down the next day on a Sunday early afternoon. I start calling around and hoped one of the closed auto shops would pick up. I got a answer from Ben the owner at AAMCO. He was super friendly. Came in when they were closed to open the lot so I could get my car towed in. Also was super nice when I had to call him back to come open the lot because I needed something out of my car. The next day they were able to give me answers of what happened within 2 hours of working on my car. On Tuesday morning I went in and got detailed information on what I did wrong and how to properly do it by one of theyre mechanics Juan. Really smart guy would trust him and anyone on Ben's team todo work on my vehicles again. I will and already have recommend them to people who need work done. I've driven my car alot over the last week an no issues!  Great people, great customer service, trustworthy maintenance preformed.<//text>

We were SO STRESSED- the money, the fact it was a weekend and most shops are closed, and especially Covid throwing a wrench in EVERYTHING! But first thing Saturday morning we called AAMCO and spoke with the owner, Ben. The calls from the shop were being forwarded to his personal phone, and he was all over it trying to get us helped. We had AAA tow it to the shop, and he went straight there from his house to meet the driver. He took it apart to diagnose is first thing Monday morning. We felt relieved that his prices were 500-$1000 cheaper than what the dealerships were gonna charge to replace the clutch, and he gave us a timeline of about 48 hours to do the work, where as the dealership said anywhere from 5-7 days.. possibly more. When they took it apart LUCKILY it was just an axle and not the clutch. He took care of it and had it ready by the next day. He worked with us and had offered some discounts. We will definitely be bringing our vehicles back to them if we have any other major issues. Ben was very personal and made us feel like a HUGE weight was lifted off our shoulders when we first talked to him on the phone. Thank you and your team for all you did to get us back on the road!!!<//review>< resp>

I have a Mercedes GL350 with a Transfer Case that failed. I thought this was a job that I could do myself and went out and found a refurbished part. I quick determined that this was not a job for the common man :-)

I visited Ben over at AAMCO and looked at the car and confirmed the issue was the Transfer Case. Ben and his group went the extra mile and I dropped off the car and within 1 day the vehicle was repaired and running like new again....at a great price.

Would highly recommend these guys ....great service at a great price.</Text>

I really do hate leaving a bad review for this company because at the end of the day they fixed my vehicle and at a reasonable price. Still,  I can't shake the idea that though they are extremely nice that they cannot fully be trusted.

I contacted AAMCO because I thought I was having transmission issues with my vehicle... It would not go into gear. In fact, when I talked to the staff here I first mentioned that I may have a transmission issue. Staff went out of their way to accommodate my vehicle showing up after regular business hours. They also diagnosed my problem for free. These are the only reasons I gave two stars rather than one.

The next day, I was told that my transmission was indeed out and would cost $4,500 to repair. I explained that I might just give up the vehicle and they kept pushing me to take out loans and find other ways to be creative about making the payment. During one of these conversations one of the workers slipped and mentioned to me that the strap was broken on the steering and should only cost a couple of hundred dollars to get fixed. when I mention why I would not just do this then he backtracked and said that this broken strap was indicative of a transmission problem. They also told me that I had seven transmission codes.

At this point, I still believed they were being honest. However, I decided to see if auto shops near my home what cost less than in Oceanside. however, when I called the shops near my home they were thoroughly surprised that I was quoting a transmission replacement even though my strap was broken. One person specifically told me that a strap can be replace for $200 and that a broken strap has nothing to do with the transmission.

I called another shot to verify this information. This third shop also told me that a broken strap will lead to no codes for transmission. They told me that they would only recommend replacing the transmission if I had a few hundred transmission codes stored.

I was extremely upset with AAMCO for misleading me and making me believe that my vehicle need a new transmission in order to run properly. Because I live an hour away I could not simply come and pick up my vehicle. I decided that my only options were to either tow it to a different shop or allow them to repair the strap.

I then called them and explained that I would have the money for the transmission in a couple of weeks. I told them that if we could fix the strap today that I would come back for the transmission. They fixed this strap for about $550 (I had other oceanside bids for about this amount). I picked the vehicle up the next day... again, I am unsure if I can trust this company. It seems to me that they were being misleading on purpose. I will never go back.

One more thing I should mention... I was told that I would be given a military discount as I am a disabled veteran. This was not honored. Supposedly though, the $550 price included a 10% discount for using cash.< /text>

< Review>
I took my 2002 Mr 2 Toyota Spyder to AAMCO Oceanside for a clutch issue.  I usually go to the dealer for any work on Mr 2.... but I have been hearing the AAMCO Ads done by Tim Conway Jr on KFI am 640 and decided to give my local AAMCO Oceanside a try. I had no idea that AAMCO had so many services for vehicles!  From the first phone call to picking up my vehicle, I can not say enough good things about AAMCO Oceanside! AAMCO Oceanside...is a Hidden Gem!  Ben (also the owner) was honest, professional and extremely helpful in getting me and Mr 2 back on the road!  I really appreciated Ben's honesty and the thorough inspection to what Mr 2 really needed!  All the work is guaranteed and under warranty nationwide with any AAMCO.  I personally know this car inside and out when it comes to 'bad noises' so I knew when the  Screech and grind noise I was hearing... must be the clutch....  Well, picking up Mr 2 today and driving her home... OMG! I thought I had a brand new car!  Shifting is so smoooth (even better than before!) and the drive home was so fun once again!   I will be making AAMCO Oceanside my regular 'go to' hospital for Mr 2! I am very happy with the service, the professional treatment and of course... the quality of the work that was performed! Thank You so much Ben of AAMCO Oceanside!<//Review>

He bent over backwards to accommodate my time constraints and made sure my car was taken care of in a timely manner.

My daughter attends college and resides in Oceanside, CA. When her car started to run roughly I told her to go to AAMCO to have it checked out. They did a very thorough evaluation and provided an estimate to take care of the problems. As the car had 175,000 miles on it I decided to replace the car rather than put more money into it. AAMCO allowed us to leave the car in their secured lot until I could have it picked up. I know they didn't have to do that but I am appreciative the did. Very professional operation, top to bottom. Thank You.</text>

<text>If I could give no stars I would.
I have an absolutely long, ridiculous, messy story over my visit here but my point is DO NOT REPAIR YOUR TRANSMISSION HERE. ESPECIALLY SPORTS CARS. You have been warned.
For starters, their automatic price for labor is a thousand. That means taking out the transmission, and then the install. Price for the actual rebuild is even more. Yes, all the seals they remove that fall apart are SUPPOSED TO be part of the job/cost, but they CHARGE YOU anyway. (Which is illegal by the way)
I dropped my car off for a transmission repair because I was made to believe they are "experts" and know what they're doing. WRONG.
After around 6 WEEKS (or more) I finally get my car back, which cost me a total of over 4 thousand dollars, 4K!! Around not even a month later the transmission was toast. Same exact issues that I had before only now I don't have the built gears and high performance parts in there, so I knew this was a bust.
I take it back and they refused to cover it under warranty, saying I needed to pay for an entire new rebuild. Spoiler alert they ended up covering it after I decided I was going else where.
This time I drive my sports car like an absolutely baby even after 3-5 months hoping this transmission doesn't fall apart. (Who owns a sports car and doesn't step on it??) Well it ended up falling apart anyway. Tired of the mess I went to a different shop not in the area around Base because these people love screwing over Marines. I found a very reputable performance shop in the Riverside area and they did the exact same job for 1,600!!! Their labor was 400!!
I had them inspect the transmission I had and to no surprise the job they did was absolutely terrible. No trace of any high performance parts on top of a lot of mistakes. Never going here for anything EVER again.
For those of you who are looking for anything that has to do with cars and services, get a hold of me and I'll guide you to the shop you need! Save your time and money!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

After a long search for someone who was able to help me with my transmission problems I finally found the place. I spoke to Ben if he was able to fix my transmission and without hesitation he said yes! Not only were they able to fix my issue, they are incredibly fast! It took a total of two days for them to fix it when other shops said it would take about 2 weeks. Ben also gave me a great price! I would recommend everyone to AAMCO in Oceanside!</Text>

< review>
(THESE INDIVIDUALS SCREW YOUNG NAIVE MARINES) Do NOT go here, they will charge you a ridiculous price for terrible service. I had my transmission repaired twice now, and it already needs a 3rd repair within a span of 8 MONTHS. They are either complete scam artists, or utterly incompetent. They followed up on my warranty, but instead of installing a brand new transmission like I requested, or at least doing SOMETHING different, they repaired the old one, and apparently did nothing of value, and within months I was experiencing the SAME ISSUES AS BEFORE. I'm disgusted, and I WILL make sure than no Marine gets screwed over by these weasels again.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><review>This place was a joke. They weren't able to perform any tests on my radiator because the leak spilled water out quickly. So all they did was look at the crack with a flashlight and calling their Corperate Technitions over the phone. It was a guessing game. And of course they want there $125 for testing the vehicle, which they didn't do. This is the Oceanside AAMCO off Oceanside Blvd. 92054. The manager Steve will do anything to get you to pay him in cash. He will lower the price on any job if you pay him in cash. And when I paid him the check fee, it went right in his pocket. Don't take your car to AAMCO!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1507732850098, 'text': 'Abe, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback about your experience with us.

<Date>1399533023791<//Date><rate>5</rate><text>The dreaded warning lights for transmisssion  popped up and I felt some of the gear slipping on my wife's Acura TSX. So immediately , the worse case scenario popped in my head as rebuilt transmission came to mind. I took it to the AAMCO shop and was given an update within 1 hour after dropping it off.  I was lucky because the technician found it to be chewed through wires probably from pesky mice.  So instead of 1000’s of dollars I was dreading the cost for the repair to be; it  was less than $100. The biggest fear of dropping off any  car is the unneeded up charges we hear horror stories about, well chalk this one up in the honest and fair mechanic category.</text>< Pics>

Next I was going on the assumption my repair would cost me alot but was quickly pleased when over the course of time in the shop that it was suggested that I had plenty of options to choose from.
Lastly my experience was centered around my needs and I was given the chance to be given the ability to have a good relationship with the aamco team.
I highly recogmend this shop to all my friends and challenge anybody to find a better place.<//review></record>

When I showed up for my appointment for the requested service, the price quote went from $130 to $256.32 with no changes in the requested service.
I feel I was baited in with a low price and once I was in their shop, they raised their prices.
If it was an honest mistake, then the shop should have honored the price quote.
In the Marines, we honor our mistakes.< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>1</rating><review>It does not matter what your problem is or what the "manager" promises I promise you are better off pushing your car off a bridge. This is without a doubt the worst service I have received in 30 years. The work is second rate, the prices are unacceptable, and the manager will do everything in his power to avoid honoring a warranty.  you owe it to yourself and your family to go elsewhere for your automotive needs!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Quick fast and reliable service. Im one of those DIY type of mechanics and I messed up. These guys were able to resolve the problem get the parts and the car fixed in a reasonable amount of time during the Christmas holidays. Highly recommended for future repairs will be taking vehicle there for my transmission and any other mechanical needs. A++</review>

< Review>
Had to get my transmission rebuilt on my 96 Dodge Ram 1500 this last month.  First local place I took it too in Carlsbad said they wouldn't rebuild (even though they weren't sure if it was just a part of the transmission that needed work or the whole thing) and pushed me towards spending $3k to get replace the whole thing with a used one, no warranty.

My friend suggested I get someone else to check it out as it could just be a part of the transmission, rather than replace the whole thing.

Decided to give AAMCO a try.  Jimmy was my contact at AAMCO and was straightforward with me from the get go explaining everything.  They found out nothing mechanically was wrong with the transmission, just a few parts needed to be re-built, not the whole thing.

They had me back on the road in 2 days and gave me a 1-year warranty on their work.

Saved me some cash, were honest and upfront and got me back on the road quickly.  Couldn't ask for much better.

Truck is running great!<//Review>

Yesterday, I took my car to Aamco in Oceanside. I was having problems with what I thought was a transmission issue. Ben and his staff took my car on several test drives and determined that I was actually low on fluids. They checked all of my fluid levels and brought all of them up to where they should be. Then, they refused payment of any sort. This level of professionalism and service is so rare these days. I recommend them to anyone who is having car trouble. You won't be disappointed!

Disappointed on the outcome when I thought everything was taken care of now I'm back to square one.
........................................................... Good guys here I called about my BMW to get the transmission diagnosed the boss said to bring it in and they ended up finding the issue which had nothing to do with the transmission it was with the engine misfiring causing the  error codes to show it was the transmission. Anyway they corrected the issue cleared all the codes and now I'm a happy camper.

Two thumbs up for these guys I spoke with the mechanic and he showed me the defective part and explained what was happening but we couldn't find the cause of the issue which is fine now that the car is operating normal. Spoke with the owner on the way out he's an ARMY Vietnam Vet doing good things I was also in the ARMY glad to see ARMY people doing good. They do all kinds of services on cars not just transmission repair so this could be my go to shop from now on. Thanks again.<//text><pics>None<//pics><gmapID>0x80dc71c4cb9f9099:0x69d7e281ae53155f< /gmapID>< response>

<Text>This place was a joke. They weren't able to perform any tests on my radiator because the leak spilled water out quickly. So all they did was look at the crack with a flashlight and calling their Corperate Technitions over the phone. It was a guessing game. And of course they want there $125 for testing the vehicle, which they didn't do. This is the Oceanside AAMCO off Oceanside Blvd. 92054. The manager Steve will do anything to get you to pay him in cash. He will lower the price on any job if you pay him in cash. And when I paid him the check fee, it went right in his pocket. Don't take your car to AAMCO!</Text><user_name>Abe Reles<//user_name><Date>1506731035742</Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1507732850098, 'text': 'Abe, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback about your experience with us.

Both had the same quality of service, but the one in Oceanside left a stellar impression. I had a great experience every time I go there. The price quotes I got were cheaper than other places. When they did my transmission, they also gave me a free oil change that I didn't even expect. Service was quick yet thorough. The owner Ben is very personable. I coincidentally ran into him at the mall, and he actually remembers his customers, so I had few minutes of chit-chat with him there also. He treats you like a friend rather than just "every other customer".</review>< pictures>

I am writing this review to help prevent others from suffering the same aggravation I suffered as a customer of AAMCO in Oceanside, CA. I have been building Jeep Wranglers for Off Road use for the last 16 years. I am currently in my 5th Project build a 2008 Jeep JK.   I noticed my Clutch was starting to fail and didn't desire to spend a few nights at the hobby shop on base as I have a new born at home. I brought my Jeep in to AAMCO Oceanside.  The Owner Ben was very friendly and supportive of the Military, and made me feel like I would be taken good care of.  He said it would be a day maybe two to replace the Clutch on Monday.  Well Friday comes around and after repeated calls for updates that were never returned I finally get my Jeep. Everything appeared to be in working order other than some Transmission fluid on the bottom of the Transmission.  I just wrote this off to them not cleaning up well.  Two weeks later, after having driven less than 300 miles. I noticed a dripping leak running down from the top of the Transmission. I begin to investigate the cause, and trace the drip to the Shift Tower.  I removed the center console and discover that the Shift Boot and foam Buffers had not been re-installed properly, as well as the clip on the Shift Boot had been broken.   I removed the foam ring and Shift tower foam Buffer (which was soaked in fluid) to find there was a large dent in the body from Shift tower coming in contact with the body re-installing the transmission. The impact with the body caused one of the mounting bolts on the Shift tower to snap, and broke the seal leading to the leak during operation of the vehicle.  I resealed the Shift Tower temporarily fixing the leak.  Minus the bolt still stuck in the Transmission housing as I did not have to correct extractor at the time.  Having had corrected the issue myself as I needed the Vehicle for work the following morning.  I chose not to pursue the issue with AAMCO Oceanside because of the potential for argument that I damaged it doing the work to fix it myself. You can read more on my experience if you go to YELP as I am out of space on google.< /Text>

<text>I have been a loyal AAMCO cusotmer for years, having had a number of major services done, such as transmission rebuild, radiator, water pump, starter, alternator, battery replacement, and smaller jobs such as oil changes and tire rotations. My most recent visit was for my brakes, pads & rotors, which I had replaced a couple years ago there. Needing pads and rotors again, due to many miles and my hard driving, I was disapointed to find out that my warranty had expired and I was faced with paying full price to have them replaced once again. Ben, the owner of the Oceanside shop, and his team were extremely helpful, even offering me a ride home. Even though my warranty was long over, Ben astonished me by offering to work with me on the cost through reduced cost on parts and waiving the ENTIRE labor cost!!! I could not have asked for better service or a better experience, especially since they had no obligation to help me in this way. Then Ben raised the bar even higher by offering to help out with the price on my next oil change too. Amazing! I will continue to be a lifelong customer and fan of AMMCO of Oceanside. 5 stars all the way, every time. Thanks Ben and team.<//text>< pics>

I am so impressed with Aamco Oceanside, I will write a review. I never do this, but here we go. I was told by my trusted mechanic that I needed to replace my tranny on my 2001 Tundra. I have had this mechanic for over 25 years. Well, a friend of mine said to check out Aamco. Glad I did. It was a tune up issue vs a tranny issue that saved me about $2,500. The guys at the shop (Steve in particular) was professional, straight forward, honest and kept me up to date on status of my truck. They could have went ahead and said I need a new tranny, but NO, they were honest. I highly recomment this Aamco to everyone. They are a 5 STAR company with 5 STAR employees. Thanks Steve. Pat L. Carlsbad, Ca.< /text>

<Review>My first time to aamco was scary but when I got to talk to a real person my fears were subsided.
Next I was going on the assumption my repair would cost me alot but was quickly pleased when over the course of time in the shop that it was suggested that I had plenty of options to choose from.
Lastly my experience was centered around my needs and I was given the chance to be given the ability to have a good relationship with the aamco team.
I highly recogmend this shop to all my friends and challenge anybody to find a better place.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dc71c4cb9f9099:0x69d7e281ae53155f< /gmapID>< Rate>

< Review>
The dreaded warning lights for transmisssion  popped up and I felt some of the gear slipping on my wife's Acura TSX. So immediately , the worse case scenario popped in my head as rebuilt transmission came to mind. I took it to the AAMCO shop and was given an update within 1 hour after dropping it off.  I was lucky because the technician found it to be chewed through wires probably from pesky mice.  So instead of 1000’s of dollars I was dreading the cost for the repair to be; it  was less than $100. The biggest fear of dropping off any  car is the unneeded up charges we hear horror stories about, well chalk this one up in the honest and fair mechanic category.< /Review>

Horrible. Rebuilt transmissions last less that 25,000 miles. And it took them 3 tries to do it.</Review>

<review>It’s an affordable price, I use to love coming to this gym before,  the employees were supper clean. They were constantly cleaning the machines and disinfecting. Now the new people just stand around and don’t clean its extremely dirty and dusty inside. It starting to stink. Common Fitness 19 keep it clean!!!!</review></record>

I love that it is a small gym. It allows me to get in, get my workout done, and get out. Staff is friendly. The equipment is maintained nicely. If there ever is an issue the staff does their best to correct the issue. I do understand that during peck hours you might have to wait for specific strength training equipment. My experience is most member are willing to split the machine with others.
If you are looking for a small gym to just get it done, I highly recommend visiting with the staff to see if the gym meets your needs.<//Review>

I really like this gym. The employees aren't staking you trying to get you to do personal training. They let you workout in peace. The facility is always clean.  Everyone is friendly. I wish it was a tad bigger though. Other then that no complaints. I've been working out in this gym for about a year now and I can honestly say I like it better then any other gyms I've used.<//text>

Not complaining not as big as the location in redlands but when you need to get the work out on. Man. I be really pumped when I come hear music all loud, but when I come here I be blasting my head phones as well.  They don't have a stair master system but they do have something similar as well.  Great place to work out.  Staff members are willing to help you out when you ask but other then that I'm not complaining it's clean, and the air is circulating so you don't feel sweaty and yucky< /review>

It's a decent place to work out if you can tolerate the so-called music that is way too loud. Can we like mix it up a little people? Turn off the KISS FM and put on some kick-ass rock and roll, 93 FM or something... Please!! Thank you God for earbuds and Pandora!<//Text>

<text>Shady bait and switch tactics. I called twice to verify they had the $1 down AND $9.99 a month promotion I could sign up for. Two separate employees told me yes, come on in. I was very clear in my questions when verifying this. When I went in to actually signup Sarina (?) stated that wasn't true and the other employees were wrong, that it was $49.99 down. When I asked to speak to the manager she said he was busy training someone since he is the trainer and manager. Uhh... No thanks. I'll just renew my LA Fitness membership and pay a little more for classes, swimming pool, spa, showers, cycling, etc. The only thing Fitness 19 has going for it is convenience. The small size of the gym was also a little weird. Using the bench press with someone else's butt right next to your face is a little weird.<//text></record>

In the last several months I have found the gym to be extremely clean the employees more professional. I love the way the manager Tony has rearranged the equipment so it makes more room for people to move around and work out. I feel the gyms quality of standards have risen extremely.</text>

I really wanted to join this place because they had a great promo going on ($7.00 per month), amazing price right? The gym looked very nice, clean, LCD TV's everywhere, everybody was working out, BUT when I stopped by - I was very disappointed by the STAFF! I approached the fitness agent to inquire about the $7.00 per month - I received HORRIBLE customer service, just awful!
I intend to speak with the Manager of the establishment, if I am not satisfied with the outcome of my concern, I will contact a District or Regional Manager, if I am still not satisfied with my concern, I will contact the corporate office.

Little did the fitness agent know, I am the type of person who will take my concern ALL the way to the top of the chain!!!</review>

<Review>Be careful what you sign up for. They will suck all the money out of your account right under your nose legally. Read carefully what you're signing. They deducted extra money from my account and I didnt realize it until $100's of dollars and a few months later. When I asked for a credit they refused. Very unhelpful, sad and discouraging.  Dont trust the pre-authorized payment (EFT) system. It's a justifiable way for them to have permission to legally deduct from your account and you cant dispute it. This has discouraged me to sign up for another gym. Thanks a lot Fitness19 !!!!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c34bc548e035d9:0x1c9215cb684414dd</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Small inside and it often is crowded. Some of the equipment has been abused such as the bench and squat bars are all bent. Still it's hard to beat the convenience of the location.</Review>

Stay away from this place. I started my membership cause it was a great price and close by. I moved to Los angeles a year later and tried to cancel my membership and they said i had to come in to cancel. I kept calling and found I could send a certified letter or have another member bring in my letter. Another member brought it in for me and still they kept charging me. So 1 year and 8 months after I moved to los angeles they finally canceled my membership, but will not refund me any of the monthly money they charged me. They are a horrible company and have no one to answer to, the general manager get the final say and can screw people any way they want since there are no corporate offices and the "investors" apparently don't have phone numbers. Do not give them your business.< /Review>

These guys were great! They came when they said they would and repaired what was needed. They didn’t try to charge me for any extra work. Great customer service. I will definitely recommend and will be using again.<//Text>

<Review>Our hot water heater developed a leak early afternoon on a Saturday. I called several hot water heater installers and they stated the earliest they would be able to install a new hot water heater would be Tuesday but when I called 5 Star Plumbing the person who answered the phone stated they would be able to install a new hot water heater on 8:00am. Sunday. I then gave them my okay to that time to install the new unit. Then on Sunday morning @ 7:37am. I received a text that Ivan from 5 Star Plumbing was on route to install the new unit. Ivan arrived @ approx. 8:15am.. He finished the installation @ approx. 11:30am. I could not be happier with the installation and the professional work and manner of the installer Ivan. At this time I would recommend 5 Star Plumbing to anyone who might have a plumbing issue.< /Review></record>

These guys rock.  I had Bell Brothers out to quote a repair on a leaking pipe under my house, and they quoted $4,000.  Called 5 Star for a second opinion and they did it for a quarter of the cost, and had a technician out within an hour.  The tech was polite, answered questions, and did a great repair.  I’m a convert to 5 Star.<//Text>

It saved me money without replacing the valve.  Unfortunately later waterbeads slowly started to build.  Called 5-star plumbing to replace the faucet.

Another company quoted us twice as much as five star to get the job done. We were encouraged to give up a 3-day right to cancel. But I maintained that I had a right to cancel before work was started the next day. That gave me time to look around. Thank goodness I did. 5 * came and did the job half the cost and it's a great job. They are professional and know what they're doing.< /Text>

The technician arrived on the earlier side, and got straight to work. It seemed to be a difficult location for the clog, but when it was finally found, it got cleared instantly. We are happy we did decide to go with a professional, since this repair would of been way out of our league AND the technician informed us that our toilet has a slow leak. Thank you for all the help!

Update 3 weeks later:
Long story short. Do not contact them via their sales@ email regarding any post-visit inquiries or issues. Or respond to any emails from "Oleg" asking for a review are automated. I had waited three weeks for a response that I had no idea wasn't coming. I updated my review, and dropped the rating, and that alerted a response. 5 star called, having understood the issue from my detailed review update and sent a tech for a call back out to us later that afternoon. It was the same texh, and we had the same level of professional courtesy. As of now, we are informed that the issue is resolved and all should be well and unclogged.  Once they are actually aware of any plight, they are very quick to respond and handle.< /Text>< name>

We had scheduled an appointment with another plumbing company, but they canceled on us 2 days in a row, and the 3rd day did not show, nor did they call! I went online and filled out a quote after reading the great reviews Five Star Plumbing had on Yelp. Within 5 minutes I received a call and was told they could send a plumber out between 4:30pm-6:30pm the same day! I received a text confirming our appointment and a 2nd text a short time later stating the plumber was on his way. Our plumber, Victor, was awesome!  He was friendly, very courteous, and had our leak fixed within 30 minutes!

I would DEFINITELY recommend Five Star Plumbing if you are in need of a professional, prompt, friendly, experienced plumber.< /Review>

We were selling our house and needed fast service with high quality at a reasonable price. Adam came out and fixed the original leak then checked all house plumbing and identified a second leak. He fixed everything under the house in less than 2 hours and we are back in escrow.
He was extremely fast, very professional, explained everything and I couldn't be more pleased with his and 5 Star's performance. There's a reason its in the name!!!!
I will call on your company all the time for my plumbing needs.
Thank you

We had a plumbing emergency. 5Star plumbing was able to come out the same morning. Peter determined that the do-it-yourself faucet we were trying to install in our shower was not compatible with the original plumbing resulting in a leak. Peter quoted us a price to change out the valve in the wall and install the new faucet for a reasonable price. Peter was professional and truly saved the day.< /review>

Victor was professional and courteous as well as knowledgeable.
Victor resolved the issue and explained how our sump system was working and what we might have to do in the future to prevent another incident.
The only downside to great service is cost ... it was not cheap but I would pay it again for such good service.<//Review>

Water heater stopped working and I contacted multiple handymen and plumbers for estimates. Some were slow to response, overpriced, or appeared rude. 5 Star Plumbing was courteous and super responsive. They were able to send Ivan out to my home the same day and kept me updated when he is en route. As it turned out, my water heater parts are still under warranty. Ivan contacted the manufacturer for me and was able to get the parts shipped to me free of charge. Ivan ended up having to come back twice to my house because the manufacturer did not send all the parts the first time. Although frustrating, Ivan kept me updated throughout the process via text and came back to install the parts in between calls the next day. Really appreciate Ivan’s great customer service and professionalism!<//review>

I contacted them and they scheduled the appointment for 0800 on a Saturday. Khalil was on time, had his mask and shoe covers on and fixed the problem right away. Also gave us a reasonable price for the job. Will not hesitate to use them again and will highly recommend them to our family and friends!<//text>< rate>

This was our first time using 5 Star for plumbing services.  Adam and Amir did a great job with our valve replacement and faucet installation.  They explained in detail what they planned to do, and then explained again what they had done.  They were really fast workers; they completed our three jobs in about an hour, which included a trip to Home Depot for parts.  We will definitely use 5 Star again for larger plumbing jobs.< /review>

<review>Very polite service man. I believe his name was Carlos. Unclogged the kitchen drain within minutes. But I was told by the receptionist that the $150.00 service fee would be applied towards my bill. If so then how did a 5 min job cost me $280.00?  Otherwise, I am happy with the job. I have a lot of plumming in need of repair but not at these prices. I'll have to look for another company<//review><response>None<//response>< Pics>

Victor came by promptly in the service window, ended up having to stay longer than expected, and he got the jobs done excellently!! I really appreciated that he got everything done in one visit. He had no problem running out to the store to get one more part because the plumbing in my house is kinda old. I had a slow draining sink, the toilet was acting up, and I had him replace the shower handle/mechanisms. Overall fantastic job. I appreciated his explanations, so I could understand what was going on while he was fixing it. I'm not versed in standard prices for plumbers, but it was in the range I was expecting. I definitely recommend them and will call again if I need more plumbing work done. Thank you so much for the wonderful work!! :)<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I contacted 5-Star Plumbing after hours for a slow water heater leak coming from the top of the tank. I received a call back later that evening and scheduled an appointment for the following morning. Since our water heater is over 12 yrs old, I assumed it needed to be replaced so when the technician (Adam) recommended replacing the corroded pipe fittings rather than replacing the entire water heater, I was pleasantly surprised. After making the necessary repairs, Adam performed a thorough leak check and then proceeded to flush the water tank. Adam recommended performing this preventative maintenance annually and took the time to walk me through the entire procedure (step-by-step). I highly recommend 5-Star Plumbing and commend Adam for his honesty, professionalism and proficiency and for wearing a face mask at all times.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

We needed to check a leak in our front yard.  Ivan showed up on time and asked us questions.  He identified what the problem was in a very short time but also checked other things for us to insure we knew the issue so a permanent fix could be done.  It turned out to be an issue with water company and added comments to the email he sent us so we could show the water department.
Ivan was so detailed and knowledgeable we will definitely use 5 Star in the future.<//Text>

I had no issue with the job, except that the person on the phone told me the fees for service call and if they needed to scope the pipes (they didn’t), but did not say there was a separate cost for the inspection. When the guy finished the work on site, he told me it was $100 more than expected. On the phone I was told paying in cash meant a discount, so they should have told me all possible costs. Since an inspection was the expressed reason I called them, they should have told me what it cost when I scheduled the job.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Woke up to a broken water heater with loud hissing and no hot water. I called 5 star plumbing and within the hour someone was at my home , diagnosing the problem and in the end installing a new water heater. All said and done it was all resolved by noon.  Great service man , Victor, very nice and straight forward. He busted his butt and got us going way fast. Thanks!</Text>

I had a gas leak in my backyard which made the fire pit unusable. PGE shut it off and recommended I get a plumber to fix said fire pit. I went with this company but it was $200 just to get a quote from them. The technician that came out told me he could repair the firepit no problem for $2000. I was happy with this estimate and went forward with them. The day of the job, I mentioned where the key valve was and the plumber said it shouldn't be an issue. The job I hired them for was the firepit, and that's the last thing they bothered to check even after I brought up my concern. After they tore up my yard, they finally looked at the firepit and told me that in fact the issue i brought up was an issue and they couldn't complete the job as promised and asked if I wanted to continue the work. At this point, a lot of damage had been done to my yard so I basically had to say yes otherwise it was all for nothing. And even though they weren't going to complete the job, they still were charging me the full $2000. Had I not complained to management, they would not have come back a few days later to connect the firepit and "fix" their damages. They couldn't even be bothered to put a stepping stone back and instead dropped it on a sprinkler. Management gave me a discount after my complaints but it should never have come to that. The plumber should've verified he could do the job before he ruined the lawn. Yelp doesn't let me post videos otherwise I would share here the interaction with the plumber. I regret hiring this company. You might have better experiences, but mine was terrible.<//text>

5 Star and I agreed to a price to fix my sewer line.  They sent out a couple of guys out who thought the work was too hard and wanted 50% more money than the agreed upon price to finish the job.  I said no.  They left the job site only to find out later that they damaged my water line and tried to cover it up.  Now I have a huge leak that I had to pay another plumber to fix.  I explained what happened and sent them video and picture evidence.  They decided to ignore me...  They are very expensive and are only willing to help if you will pay their exorbitant prices.<//review>

<review>5 Star Plumbing sent Peter to replace the wax seals at the bases of two leaky toilets. Peter was friendly, cordial, knowledgeable and efficient.

5 Star Plumbing saved us from a costly plan B. Adam and his team member were great listened to my issue and got it resolved in a hour. Work was neat and as stated. If you find yourself in need of a drip pan for your washing machine. Call 5 Star Plumbing A +.
I will be using their service again.<//Review>

Adam called and wanted to come earlier which was fine. He arrived and we did a walk through of the job, the estimate and he began working. Amazing hustling through the job. He got it all done in about 2.5 hours from start to finish and was very professional. Job and job site are immaculate.</text>

<Review>I am a return customer and this is the 3rd time that I have used "5 Star Plumbing".  I have used this company to replace bad missing plumbing and also for a bad shower faucet leak.  Each time I've called, a technician was at my home within and hour and the issued was fixed shortly after.

Great customer service and good work:)</Review><rating>5</rating><resp>None</resp>< name>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Super easy experience with 5 star. I contacted them and got a fair quote on Yelp and scheduled it for a few days later. Victor I think was his name came out and installed a replacement faucet in our sink. Because of how old our sink/house is, the new faucet wasn’t initially totally flush. Because this wasn’t the fault of the plumber and was because of the wonky sink, he could have left it as is or charged more to fix it. Instead he spent an extra 30 minutes making it perfect. I would use these guys again no question<//Text>< pics>

My home had the original shower cartridge from back in the 80s when it was built. I was told very professionally that they might not be able to find a replacement, I appreciated being told upfront that information. However they ended up finding one, somewhere! I am so thankful for their help and expertise. I would highly recommend them to any and all of my family and friends.< /text>

So tepid water is NOT hot water. He said it’s probably old you just need a new one. (It’s 4 year old). When asked what he thinks May have caused it, he didn’t know. He never looked at the thermostat or the heating elements. That was it. $145 for placing a hand on it and saying he would send some quotes for new ones. Won’t use them again.< /Text>< username>

I called with an emergency and 5 Star had someone there in half an hour! This gentleman worked hard to solve my very clogged drains! Can thank them enough! I had to call them back because the house was still not drawing. They found the main line and put in 2 trap outs so that these problems wouldn’t repeat. Adam was very courteous and helpful. They left me feeling as though my chronic problem was repaired. They also cleaned the area when they were done.<//Text>

I have used 5 star several times and they always exceed expectations. Adam the plumber- was excellent. He wore gloves, shoe covers and a face mask. He was efficient and everything worked perfectly THE FIRST TIME. I highly recommend this company. They will call you back promptly and get you in as quickly as they can.<//Review>

We were very pleased with 5-Star! We needed to have a new toilet installed. Adam arrived and was very professional and friendly. He did a great job! First time with 5-Star and will continue to utilize their services from now on!

<Text>Wanted plumber to investigate potential water leak under cement in kitchen area. We came across some very damp concrete as we were replacing floors in the house. Area dried very well overnight. Plumber arrived on site and checked meter and water pressure. Based on meter movement for our house he came to the conclusion that we had no water leak as meter did not move when water was off inside house. It only started moving when water was turned on.</Text>< time>

<review>We bought an old 1960 house in Roseville and started having slow drain issues right after moving in. Both bathrooms and kitchen sink were completely clogged after a few days of normalusage. I messaged these guys on Yelp late at night and they were able to send a tech in the morning! He tried to do the usual thing to clear the sewage but found some tree roots :( They sent another tech with more equipment for a camera inspection in just a few hours. They found the cleanout ( I didn't know the house had one) and were able to clear out the roots form this old leaky clean out. Gonna be using them again to replace the cleanout. Recommend!</review>< pictures>

So I’ve been having issues with both of my toilets not flushing regularly. I went to Yelp and reached out to a few companies. 5 Star was the first to reach out, the first to schedule an apt and came quite quickly. The technician also was able to complete the job and save me money (apparently there was a rock lodged in the outdoor pipe and had they had to dig it would’ve cost me a fortune). Very friendly service and I would recommend them again.</Text>

Originally I gave a 5 star review because the service was fast and very friendly and professional.  Unfortunately, it turns out that all three of the items I asked to be completed were either done incorrectly or had to be re-addressed.  It could have just been a bad day so it was hard for me to change my review, but I needed to.  The customer relations aspect was always excellent at least.<//review>

5 Star was excellent! They responded to my email inquiry in a few minutes and set up an appointment for the next day someone to come out to give me a bid on replacing a metal toilet flange and wax ring.  The repairman arrived right on time.  He was pleasant and professional.  I agreed to let 5-Star do the work.  Adam, the repairman, got the repair done quickly and efficiently.  He also cleaned up after himself and left the bathroom in good shape.  I was positively impressed!</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I called the 5 Star Plumbing late afternoon on Oct 22 and explained the urgency for fixing the water line leak expeditiously.  The service dispatcher (Adam) promptly acted and arranged for a inspection the next day in the morning between 8 and 10 AM.  The plumbing technician (Khalil K) came to my place sharp at 8:00 AM and went to work and accurately diagnosed the leaking issue and took video clip of the pipe failure to document it well. The technician followed all safety procedures and did a neat job.  I couldn't be more happy.  In fact, I am willing to agree that this was probably the best plumbing job completed by any plumbing company that I had to use.  Strongly recommend this company to anyone who needs a prompt and good plumbing work.  However, this company is pricey and if they can lower their price, the are definitely going to dominate the Sacramento area.

<review>I was out of town when a pipe burst in the backyard and the wife had called to as they were the only company that had availability. They couldn't find the water main shutoff valve so they weren't able to fix the pipe. I had never had to shut the water main off so I couldn't direct them over the phone as I wasn't exactly sure were it was. You would think this would be pretty standard for a professional plumber. They walked around the property for about an hour, eventually said they couldn't do anything without shutting the water off and still charged us $149 for the visit. When I got home it took me about 2 minutes to find it in the front yard. What a waste of time and money.  I would not recommend using this service<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x809b20ad1d0d65bf:0xa3f2214bbea28b92< /Gmap_id></record>

We thought we had a leak from our second floor bathroom into our first floor den ceiling. Called a couple of plumbers and 5 Star was able to schedule us quickly. We did actually schedule a 2nd service to come out as we thought we'd need bids, the soonest the could schedule us was a week out. Dimas at 5-Star came texted he was on his way, was actually early. He spent quite a bit of time investigating the issue and we knew we would need to cut into the ceiling to identify the issue as there was no outward appearance of any issues upstairs. After some time the issue was resolved. No major repair needed. Short of some dry wall and a very reasonable sevice charge that we were quoted up front we're good to go. Dimas was very professional and thorough. I would recommend 5 Star!<//Text>

<review>I'm typically a fairly handy person, and I enjoy doing my own repairs. Had a clog in the tub, and I couldn't quite get it through the cross bars of the drain, so I removed it. Wrong move! Turns out that when the previous owner renovated the bathroom, they used the wrong flange, and I couldn't get it to screw back into the pipe! After muddling about in the crawl space, I finally called 5 Star Plumbing, and they were able to come out about an hour later. They were able to replace the part and get everything connected back up in ~30 minutes. I was incredibly impressed with the staff - they were friendly, efficient, and mindful of Covid-19 precautions. But above all, I appreciate that they dealt directly with me, and not my husband (who was also home), because I'm the one who called in and knew what was going on. 5 stars for 5 Star Plumbing!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>We had an issue for sewer water not going out. It was a scary situation for us. When I called them, the technician Khalil showed up within a couple of hours which was a great relieve. He was able to troubleshoot and fix it in 30 minutes. He also explained very well on the issue.

We highly recommend service from 5-Star Plumbing Inc.< /Text><username>Jawwad Ali< /username><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1607114862626<//time><rate>5</rate>< Resp>

I had a gas leak in my backyard which made the fire pit unusable. PGE shut it off and recommended I get a plumber to fix said fire pit. I went with this company but it was $200 just to get a quote from them. The technician that came out told me he could repair the firepit no problem for $2000. I was happy with this estimate and went forward with them. The day of the job, I mentioned where the key valve was and the plumber said it shouldn't be an issue. The job I hired them for was the firepit, and that's the last thing they bothered to check even after I brought up my concern. After they tore up my yard, they finally looked at the firepit and told me that in fact the issue i brought up was an issue and they couldn't complete the job as promised and asked if I wanted to continue the work. At this point, a lot of damage had been done to my yard so I basically had to say yes otherwise it was all for nothing. And even though they weren't going to complete the job, they still were charging me the full $2000. Had I not complained to management, they would not have come back a few days later to connect the firepit and "fix" their damages. They couldn't even be bothered to put a stepping stone back and instead dropped it on a sprinkler. Management gave me a discount after my complaints but it should never have come to that. The plumber should've verified he could do the job before he ruined the lawn. Yelp doesn't let me post videos otherwise I would share here the interaction with the plumber. I regret hiring this company. You might have better experiences, but mine was terrible.<//Review>

I called 5 Star Plumbing based on the good reviews online. We set an appointment for the next day. I received a call from Peter asking if he could come earlier than scheduled, which worked extremely well for me. He arrived on time, was very nice, personable, clean and very knowledgeable. He got right to work and was finished within a short while. It was well worth the money as I was not able to remove and old leaky faucet bc the nut underneath the sink was frozen in place. Peter had to cut the metal flange out of the sink. A job I could not have done on my own. Peter was very respectful and I appreciated his expertise in knowing the little tricks of the trade..I absolutely would recommend 5 Star Plumbing!!!< /text>

We would recommend them highly. When our water heater broke we called and they scheduled service the next morning. The tech even face timed us that night to ensure we shut everything off appropriately to avoid flooding our garage. Very great service and very friendly.</review>

We had an 'unidentified' water leak on our property that was sending our water bill through the roof!  5-Star came out on the same day we called, within hours, and throughly inspected our property to detect the source of the leak.  Once found, they capped the leak: was sprinkler main leading from the house to the valve controls.  Unfortunately, the primary repair will require a sprinkler repair company and the broken pipe is under our patio.  However, at least we don't need to worry about the exorbitant water bill in the interim until we are able to have the issue repaired.  Thank you to 5-Star for saving the day, and saving us continued uptick on our water meter!!!<//review>

<Text>I am very impressed with 5 Star. Adam A. wore a mask the entire time and was professional and friendly. Not only did he quickly diagnose my kitchen sink problem, he even went the extra mile to fix and seal it for free. Throughout the service he would clearly communicate what needs to be done before he does it. Also he would gladly share his knowledge on what I should do to preserve the condition of my sink and all the attached tubes. Another thing: he is extremely honest in billing.

I will surely use them again in the future.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809b20ad1d0d65bf:0xa3f2214bbea28b92</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Tech was on time and efficient. Very respectful of my situation to find the water leak. He found the leak from the dishwasher in minutes. He turned the valve to the water supply off and the valve was broken. He replaced the valve, a $20.00 part, and helped me turn the power off to the dishwasher for safety. Good service but very expensive. Total was $220.00 to replace that valve. All work was done with 45 minutes.< /text>< time>

I found these guys on Yelp (just left a Yelp review too) and called them frantic on a Sunday when I found that my washer was causing gross black gunk to backup into my bathtubs and causing the toilet to leak. I was horrified and scared after reading online that it could be a sewer issue that might cost me some $6,000. The lady answering was super nice, professional and said someone would be here within the next three hours. On a Sunday! As soon as I hung up, I received a text confirming my request then within 20 minutes, a text saying someone was on their way. Mike arrived within one hour of my initial call. He wore a mask and shoe covers in the house (which none of the other contractors have done) and had me unclogged within 30 minutes. He explained the issue, made recommendations, did not try to up-sell me and the cost was far better than I’d imagined. I see they do electrical to so will plan to call this company again for all my future plumbing and electrical work. Mike saved my day! Super professional, knowledgable, honest, responsive...What an outstanding company!  10 stars!<//text>

Victor did an excellent job completing the reinstall of our toilet that was leaking at the base, he was very professional.  He was very clean and always put on and removed his booties when entering and leaving inside the house and wore a mask the whole time.</Text>

<text>I contacted 5 Star Plumbing yesterday and already have a new water heater today! Peter showed up well within the allotted 2-hr window, assessed the issue,  gave me a quote and had my new water heater installed before lunch. He was very friendly and professional too, even helping me identify why I was having a water pressure issue.

5 Star was also great at keeping in contact, letting me know Peter would be arriving and what time, and have already send follow up messages. It is not fun having to spend money on a hot water heater, but at least they made the process so much easier. Thank you Peter & 5 Star!</text>< Pictures>

The technician that came to my house was friendly professional and efficient. I was in need of a plumber ASAP on a Saturday. My appointment was at 12:30 and the technician called and arrived at 10:00 am. I am so appreciative of the service I received as I was going to have a house full of people by 3:00 pm</text>

Had a water leak in the garage on a 2 years old house, 5 Star pluming showed up on time, found the leak and fixed the problem in a few hours.
(caused by driving 2 nails into the pipe by builder)
Reasonable pricing, will use and recommend them.</Text>

<Review>5-Star Plumbing was quick to respond to our emergency pipe leak. We received notice from the city that we had an alarming increase to our water usage. Adam came out (earlier than our appointment window) and was able to identify the problem right away. He communicated what the issue was and got it repaired in about 3 hours.<//Review><time>1605313858662<//time><UserId.>101874533431619660517</UserId.><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Very expensive! $325 for a 1/2 hour of work and left without checking to make sure all drains were running clear. When I called back to let them know, i was told it would be another charge. I will never use this company again.</review>

<review>Peter came out in a timely manner and found the issue right away. He recommended that there was a bigger issue then just needing the toilet resealed as he thought there were roots. We rescheduled for the next morning, as we had to get a new toilet, and he was on time and very professional. Instantly he found the route of the problem (pun intended) and got to work. Peter was very kind and was very quick. Highly recommend 5 star plumbing to anyone that is looking for a honest, professional, and quick service.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I had a pipe burst on Veteran's Day and they replied to my request.  They had to cancel my appt the day before but came out next day at the time I requested. Their tech Adam came out and identied the leak. It was raining hard outside and the pipe was in my muddy crawl space from it flooding. He was real professional, gave me options, and got the job done in a couple hours. Fair enough price. Big relief headed into the weekend. Glad I only had to go 3 days without running water...</text>< Pictures>

Great experience!  I needed a new disposal and wanted a quick price before booking.  Out of numerous contacts they were 1 of 2 that responded.  Responded right away and with every message sent I got an immediate response.  They arrived earlier than scheduled, got in and out and wha-la .... my Mom has a working disposal again!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND !  Thanks so much!< /Review>

Professional from start to finish. Peter arrived on time, got right to work, and explained his work along the way.

We had a significant leak in our sink drain pipe which required going into the crawlspace. I wasn't doing that. But Peter did! Turns out we had two leaks. He replaced the entire line plus junction. He was quick, explanatory, and took pictures so we could see what was happening.

We called yesterday afternoon, he arrived this morning, and finished the work within a couple of hours. Peter was very personable.

The job was reasonably priced but the lifetime warranty on the work made it a deal. The peace of mind has no price.

Five Star Plumbing is our new go to plumbing company.</review>

Ivan came out to take a look at my air conditioning system on July 27th, 2020.  He was very straight-forward, courteous and friendly.  It was clear to me from the outset that he really new his stuff, and not only that, but he was honest, so it made it easy for me to make the proper decisions on how to deal with my air-conditioning unit.    I would highly recommend 5 Star!<//Review>

Communication was great. We had a problematic plug in our kitchen sink. On the first visit they could not clear the drain so they didn't charge me for the attempt. Scheduled a video inspection and they came out and found the clog and repaired it. I would definitely use them again< /text>

Long story short: we found ourselves in a bit of a jam with two kitchen projects. We were short on time but long on our list of concerns. We called 5 Star Plumbing to request a quote and assistance. Not only did they arrive that same afternoon, but they accomplished everything we needed assistance with and did so at a fair and affordable price.< /Text>

When all was said and done, they did a good job fixing my broken water main line. The price seemed pretty high considering the work involved, but that’s what you have to pay for an emergency service. I called and within 2 hours someone was here to fix the broken pipe. I would most likely use them again.< /Review>

When it comes to plumbers in Sacramento I have had some horror stories. It wasn't until I called 5 Star Plumbing that the nightmare of constant back pressure issues in the upstairs bathroom ended. These guys at 5 Star Plumbing really know their stuff, and corrected the issue where so many others couldn't resolve the problems. We will always call them if we have a future emergency plumbing need. Very professional,and clearly experienced.  Highly recommended< /Text>

<Review>It hasn't been 24 hours yet I usually Wait 3 to 5 days just because this is a plumbing item.
Toilet was leaking oy vey
Looked at Yelp try this service  They gave me an estimate of the cost of $149 to come take a look see and then if there were any other costs that $149 will go into it.
I've dealt with toilet leaks before, but this one was new.
Their experts are very good I cannot say enough I found out that I had two small little itty bitty leeks causing the problem He took the time to fix it and got it done and over with he made sure that it wasn't leaking and he told me to keep an eye on it for at least 24 hours which is totally understandable. So far everything's drying up no more leaks I'll probably get back to this in the next week just to give you an update.
Best part I can say is that we both wore masks especially during these times.  Their experts are very kind courteous knowledgeable and they get the job done.<//Review><user>115412628802750224002< /user><gmapID>0x809b20ad1d0d65bf:0xa3f2214bbea28b92</gmapID><Rate>5< /Rate><Resp>None</Resp>< Pictures>

I had water accumulating on the ceiling due to ac issue. They were prompt, arriving at the property a couple of hours after I called them. They were thorough in their assessment and in explaining what the issue was. They fixed the problem and the price was reasonable. Really happy with the experience and will use them again.< /review>

I had 5 Star Plumbing come to my home to repair the water line going into our home. They came on time, but gave me a proposal way out of line. I had dug the hole so all that had to be done was cut the 1-1/2" pvc line and install a couple of 45 deg elbows and a short pipe between them. The plumber indicated it would take him just one hour and the price would be $840. I had another contractor do the job for much less.< /text>

My experience with 5 star plumbing was great. Ivan was experienced, knowledgeable and hard working. Most importantly he was honest and fair.

If my experience with him is any indication of the level of professionalism and quality of the company - I would recommend them to my friends, family and anyone looking for dependable, honest quality work.< /review>

Peter came to my address and did a fantastic job, the only reason it is not 5 stars is because price was $480 for a new faucet, which I thought could have been slightly cheaper, and my plumber took his mask off while inside. Other than that, great job!<//review>

If you need a plumber I would highly recommend. They responded within a couple of hours and fixed the issue pretty quickly. My drainage system in my bathroom broke and left a mini flood. The plumber had what I needed on hand and quickly fixed it. I also had a “jiggly” toilet handle issue for months that he quickly fixed for me! Highly recommend!< /text>

Unfortunately we were on an install and hit a waterline. I called around and everyone’s idea of emergency service was 1-2 day. 5 star made it work and had people out within a few hours. They did a quick repair that was done right and helped us out of a bind. Will call again if I need them< /Review>

Everything about 5-star was amazing. We had a very uncomfortable experience with our main sewage line and 5-star held our hand throughout the entire process. The price was more than 50% less than other quotes we received. They were honest, reliable and excellent with communication from the moment I called the customer service number. I highly recommend this company and will definitely use them again when we need any plumbing work.<//Review>

The Repair Man, Ivan, showed up on time, diagnosed the problem well, and then HUSTLED across town to get the part before the supplier closed.  He then Hustled back to my home to finish the job in one day.  Fantastic service!< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Excellent job. Diagnosed  a tankless water heater that another so called professional said was broken. It really wasn’t broken though. I like honest, capable service guys. Petter was great. . Ivan the other guy for this company, he’s pretty excellent also. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate your help. Yesterday my tech was Ivan. He installed  some bypass flow valves pieces and some little motherboards for them in my Tankless Water Heater. He did an excellent job. He’s very very knowledgeable and I have to say he’s probably my favorite plumbing guy. Of course I give  him & the company both five stars. More if I could. Ivan you’re awesome and I appreciate everything!</review>< pics>

He came out for a leaking water valve, which he fixed. As he was leaving, we flushed the toilet and it started leaking! We were able to catch him before he left, and he replaced our wax rings. We have had problems with our toilet leaking on the past, and he solved the problem by using two wax rings. We will never use any other plumbing company and we will tell you friends and family to use them for all their plumbing needs! Thanks again Adam and 5 Star Plumbing!<//text>< date>

Again they did great job just as they have done ethical work that hard to find in california.
Other company was going to rip off of us by quoting $ thousand for last job but he solved hot water issue for $200.. Thank you keep it up and keep your reputation in tact so you don't need to spend big advertising as you have enough customer base.
Eventually your good work pays off as form of customers trust you and willing to pay top dollar for your service..</text>

From the beginning their response time was right on and scheduling was quick! We needed a ceiling fan in our daughter’s room and also the ceiling is 14 feet tall and we needed help! Not a job we could do ourselves.  Ivan and his helper got here earlier than the scheduled time and did an amazing job! Thanks guys! Great bday gift for daughter’s bday!<//Text>

I had the best experience with 5 Star Plumbing. A pipe broke over night and they came same day at the time they stated & dI'd a superb job fixing the issue.

I offered to pay cash for the service and misheard the amount on phone. They were gracious to accept the payment though it was few dollars short in light of  COVID..above and beyond the call of duty.

Highly recommend.<//review>

Although I had another engagement scheduled at 1pm, the leaky toilet was more important and so I
called to cancel my 1pm booking.  5 Star Plumbing called to let me know a repair man would be available to come earlier than 2:30 pm and if that was okay. I quickly said, "Absolutely!" At 10:30, Brandon arrived. After showing him the troubled toilet, he quickly went to work.  The work was completed in 1 to 1 1/2  hours.  I was able to attend my other appointment at 1pm!  Brandon was very knowledgeable and professional. Thank you 5 Star Plumbing!< /review><user>116994345107539903201</user>< rate>

Peter was punctual and very knowledgeable about his work. Even though there was a miss understanding with the quoted price from the office he worked to rectify it. Would recommend him. I would recommend to go over the quoted pricing with the person doing the job before, to make sure it was understood well.</text>

Excellent service and the gentleman that installed our water heater did an amazing job. It wasn’t your standard installation of just installing a water heater, he replaced our vent and several valves.<//Review>

Ivan was super professional and detailed in what he was doing for the repair. He even showed me how I can repair the leaky shower head if it ever happened to any of my other showers. He swapped out the cartridge that controls the on/off for the water. He showed me where the rubber gasket went bad and how I can tell in the future if I will get a another leak. The repair is warranted for a year. He also does Heating and Air. He showed me some easy maintenance I can do yearly so my AC unit stays in top condition.< /Text>< Pictures>

I grabbed a shovel and dug up the line to find the pvc spraying a substantial amount of water, my yard was flooding slowly. I called several plumbing companies and none were available same day. 5 star wasn't available either but the woman who I spoke with promised to call if they got a cancellation. And they did!! Adam was not just on time but early! Professional, fast and did a fantastic job! I highly recommend them🤗< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Adam and Alex were excellent.  They called ahead of time to let me know they were on their way which was before my assigned window which worked out perfectly for me.  They diagnosed the problem quickly and made the necessary repairs quickly.  The cost was better than any other plumbing service I have used in the past.  Both men were knowledgeable, professional, polite, and personable.  I will use 5 Star Plumbing again should I ever be in need of this type of service again.</text>

The people here are professional and friendly (both the appoint person and the two plumbers I’ve met in the past couple of years).  They are reasonably quick with the job, and obviously knowledgeable.  The first time was more than a year ago with a bathroom sink installation.  This second time was with emergency repair.  I would feel comfortable calling them again if I need anything done.<//review>

< Review>
After discovering a leak dripping from our ceiling directly below our master bath (shower), we contacted our landlord and they called 5 STAR PLUMBING. Our landlord said they would arrive between 8-9 am...

It was only minutes past 8 o’clock when we heard our door bell ring. The friendly face on the other side was nothing shy of polite and persistent. He got started immediately and informed us of everything going on along the way.

By 9 o’clock, only 1 hour later, he was done!

Our leaky drain was fixed and sealed!

Thank you for an outstanding job! We highly recommend this company to anyone who expects immediate results!!!!!</Review>

Anna and another gentleman, I didn’t get his name but wished I had were extremely helpful on my first call to them, they went above and beyond getting Alex and Mark out to my home in less than an hour on a Friday evening (right after Christmas)....
I sure am happy and relieved to know that I can call

Mark came by, delivered excellent customer service and solved our issue. The job was tricky, but he did not give up and he took his time to complete the job. His determination gave me the impression that he actually cared. He even fixed the sink real quick, which was a whole separate job! This employee deserves recognition, and props to 5 Star Plumbing on giving me a great experience using your plumbing service for my first time.<//Review>

My family recently moved to a new house and we had some major backups due to old leaking pipes and tree roots. I called around to get price comparison from a few companies.5 Star come and did camera inspection and shared the video with me. They provide a good estimate and finished the job using the latest technology. Thanks again,  for all your hard work, dedication and time !< /Text>

When we ran into a construction problem with the way our house was built, I really felt that the plumber was very honest and gave me his professional opinion and didn't pressure me to make a decision right then. He told me to let them know when I was ready to get the work done. I will recommend 5 Star Plumbing to others.<//review>

We were looking to get some advice on our HVAC system and called multiple companies. Oleg came out on time and was very professional. He provided good information about our particular system and what are options were. The suggestions he made were sound and appreciated. We ultimately decide to not do anything with our system, but when we do in the future I will definitely call Oleg again.< /text>

I hired 5-Star to install a gas line and I would highly recommend. Peter came out extremely fast to give me a quote and Brandon installed in less than a week. Both guys were very nice and professional. Brandon went above and beyond installing a very tricky line! Thanks for the excellent service!!<//Review>

Great experience with this company. They respond quickly and communicate clearly about pricing and expectations about the job that needs to be done. All of the people that I have interacted with (Joe, Brandon, Adam, and another man who came with Adam, sorry I didn’t catch his name) were very friendly. They replaced my bath tub drain and pipe in less than an hour. I appreciated the text messages to let me know a technician was on the way and that the technicians wore shoes covers in my house.  Highly recommend and will be using them again in the future!<//Text>

It took them all day, although they could have come back on a different day to complete the job, they didn't.  They chose to stay longer and finish the job, which we were very grateful for.  Thank you!! Highly recommended.< /text><UserId.>108187191514082594725< /UserId.>< Date>

It took the plumber less than 15 minutes to replace the faucet with new diverter. A bit expensive but convenient as it was fixed the same day. Ivan was very nice.<//Review>< Pics>

It was a great pleasure having Paul as our plumber from 5 Star Plumbing. He was quick and fast in repairing our kitchen water pipe and checking the other pipes for leaking. Service was fast and reasonably priced. Will surely recommend them to our family and friends.<//text>

Mark from 5-Star Plumbing showed up at my mother's house. He listened to what we said regarding repairs.  I was impressed that he didn't immediately recommend replacing her water heater,  but instead a repair.

I will be calling 5-Star Plumbing to do repairs at my home.

I am very pleased with 5 Star Plumbing. I was able to get appointments quickly and easily. The plumber arrived promptly and I even got a text to let me know he was on his way to my home. The work was done efficiently and was better than expected. The plumber was quite helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. He was happy to answer my questions and give me advice on a somewhat complicated job. I thought the prices were quite reasonable for the work performed. Excellent experience.<//review>

I really like their service and the quality of work.
The technician was ver helpful with question and seemed very knowledgeable.

Only strange thing that took me off guard was when they charge 3% fee if you use credit card.
I don’t know if 3% service fee is a common practice.<//Review>

<Text>A professional and thorough job. The employees all worked hard to do the job well and were very good about keeping the house tidy as they worked. We had a big job (whole house repipe and replumb, with water heater replacement) and they were very accommodating throughout the process. It really seemed like they wanted to do quality work.

For the third time, Five Star Plumbing has earned its name!  ADAM came out to fix a shower that had been leaking for far too long.  He was polite, friendly, and quick:). He took the time to explain the pricing and show me the part that needed replacing.  It was a very smooth experience.
Last time, we called the day before we were having 40 people over for a party and ALL of our toilets overflowed and flooded the bathrooms!! Peter came out THAT SAME DAY and took care of everything, including replacing a toilet AND helping us get rid of the water on the floors before the guests arrived!  These guys are really great and very knowledgeable!
They will always be my first plumbing call!<//Text>

<review>So far I've had a great experience with Adam from 5 Star. I had another plumbing company scheduled to come this morning and they never showed. Called 5 Star around 10 in the morning and they were able to come that afternoon. They are coming back Monday to do some more in depth repairs.< /review><user_name>Joshua Miller<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I called this company to get a quote on installing electrical for a spa. They came by and took pictures and measurements and I was told I’ll get a quote later in the day or next day. 2 days went by and I didn’t hear from them so I called. The guy who answered my call said he would reach out to the technician who came by my house. Another 4 days went by and I still don’t have a quote but I have 5 or more emails asking to rate their service, what a joke!<//Review>< pics>

I got a lemon of house and have dealt with many service industry professionals. I’m always apprehensive when it comes to calling professionals to come out to my house and give me an estimate to repair what’s broken. They try and upsell bigger, better, new models, etc. and take up all my time for the day. I just want an honest, quality company to give me the facts. 5 star plumbing service is indeed 5 stars! Customer service is outstanding!

I’m so glad I found 5 star plumbing! Everything was so pleasant, from point of contact to scheduling. They text you when their Tech is en route. So organized, I love it!

The Tech, Nazar, arrived on time and fixed the problem.  My water heater was acting strangely, resulting in low hot water pressure. Awesome service, no BS, just troubleshooted and fixed it!   He even helped me close my garage door because it also needs to be fixed but that’s another story.  Thank you so much 5 star plumbing!
I definitely recommend them and will use them once my water heater will need to be replaced.</text>

My water heater went out and it was about 20 years old so it was time for a new one. I had 3 companies come out and decided with 5 🌟. Peter came out and did the quote for us and was great to work with,They put us on the schedule for two days later. We decided to go for a heat pump to replace our old electric unit and SMUD gave us a $1000 cash rebate! Brandon came out for the install and he was professional and knew his stuff! Everything looks amazing! Thanks Brandon< /text>

This was a big job and done very professionally. It was also at about 50% of what others were quoting. Very single person I dealt with was responsive and knew about my project. Lastly one of our AC outlets was not working. I called and in less than 2 hours they had made the correction to reconnect the ducting that had been disconnected. All without fuss. Great customer support.</Review>< pictures>

I would definitely recommend 5-Star Plumbing to anyone. We had clogged sink and disposal wasn't working the way it's supposed to, so i
called few companies including 5-Star Plumbing & i don't regret using this company.  They were here within an hour and got the job done fast. The guy that came was thorough with his job. After he fixed the problem, he called me and had me watch him test the sink n garbage disposal. He was very polite and very friendly too. He also cleaned up after his work was done.I couldn't pronounce the guy's name..all i know it starts with an N..and he said it's like Nazareth😀. Thank you Mr Naz and 5-Star Plumbing 👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏< /text>

I had an emergency situation and 5-star responded to my inquiry fast and gave me a price right away so I didn’t have to worry or wait AND they came out the same day. I will definitely be using them whenever I have any issues. Everyone has been very professional and respectful. I’m lucky I found them.<//Text>

Brandon Flores was amazing and explained all the work, showed me where the problems were and why it needed to be done.  He also gave me options that fit my price range. This is after going with various other companies and I was given wrong information by one in particular.  I might add the other companies did not explain the problem to me and I was charged an exuberant price for just a drain inspection 3x of what I was charged by 5-star plumbing and nothing was fixed.  This made me apprehensive on even getting an estimate done, since I was worried about the price I was previously quoted. But all in all I could not be happier with the work done, after not having a working bathroom for over a month. The estimate I was given for the work was exactly what I was charged. They fixed and replaced the drains and in the tub, sink and toilet that were all leaking and put on badly by the previous owner of the home.  He was very kind and patient and even fixed the kitchen sink which only put out hot water for the last year. Any work that I need done in regards to plumbing I will definitely be going back to 5-star!  Thank you guys so much!</Text>

I had a clogged sink that did not respond to me using four different chemicals, cleaning out the trap, and using a 20-foot snake. Nazar came in, and was personable, diligent, persistent, and conscientious on the clean-up. It took over ninety minutes, but he would NOT give up until he solved the problem. I give my highest recommendation to Nazar and 5-Star. The flow is a go!</review>

< Review>
If you have any type of plumbing issue, this is the place to call! I found them on Yelp with a full 5 stars out of 300+ reviews and knew I’d be taken care of. They scheduled my appointment at a time that was convenient for me and gave me a quote over the phone. The job ended up costing us a lot more than what we expected as we do not have a cleanout apparently. Brandon was our rep and he was extremely transparent about the process and pricing and went above and beyond to give us all options available to us, including his own recommendations that aligned with the other second opinions we got. They have to come back tomorrow to finish it but I am very happy thus far with the service provided by 5-Star. They were even nice enough to honor our 20% for checking in. Looking forward to getting this project finished with 5-Star!

Updated - Brandon came out today and finished the job, installed a cleanout and it took him half the time he initially quoted. We will definitely be using 5 Star for all of our future plumbing needs!! Thanks Brandon! Also, you left a stool here...< /Review>

<text>We needed a full repipe done due to the old piping being notorious for leaking issues (Kitec). 5-star was the lowest bidder out of 4 plumbers we contacted. They got the job done in about 4 days, helped set up inspection, and did a rough patch (we did have to hire a painter for texture and paint). Plumbing works great. All the staff we were in contact with were courteous and friendly.

The inspector seemed to be impressed with their work. They also managed to do it with a minimum of dry wall removal. Other plumbers were talking about having to cut through the external stucco which would have been another thing needed to be redone aesthetically but the boys at 5-star managed to do the job without needing to do this. In fact, they ended up finishing under their original estimate! Overall, I am very satisfied with the experience. I would definitely call them again for any plumbing issues.</text><Name>Sean Marsula< /Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><GmapID>0x809b20ad1d0d65bf:0xa3f2214bbea28b92< /GmapID><user>114362883604865118117</user><rating>5</rating></record>

Excellent, fast service. Extremely responsive. 5-Star sent out Peter to check out why my water heater was malfunctioning. He determined the problem in a few minutes and made suggestions to contact the manufacturer. That saved me over $200! Highly recommended company.<//Review>

After having a very bad experience with another plumber I called this company because of the reviews. They did not disappoint! The first company came out 4 times and still left me with cold water. These guys sent two men out the same day and they had the problem fixed in less than two hours. They were polite, friendly, professional and knowledgeable. I really appreciate them coming out so quickly and fixing my water heater issues. In addition, they explained what the problem was and how to avoid it in the future. I highly recommend them.</text>

One of our pipe lines going to the second floor was leaking, we called 5 Star Plumbing for a quote and they were very responsive to our calls. The next morning, they came to our house and repaired the leaking pipe. Plumbers they sent were professional and prompt with their work. Pricing was reasonable and we do recommend their services to everyone.< /review>

5-Star Plumbing was fantastic!

I had a clogged bathroom drain and I gave them a call. They answered the phone quickly and was able to schedule a same day fix

They sent over Vitally , who was very friendly and professional. He did the work in less than an hour.

I paid via credit card and the payment process was done on-site and was very simple.

I plan to call them again if I have any other problems in the future. I would highly recommend them To anyone else.< /Text>

<review>Five star plumbing was able to book a next day appointment (it was my schedule that couldnt to same day).

I got a text alert in the morning, then the repairman Adam showed up exactly at 8, the service time.  I had a crack in my toilet, which needed replacing.   We hopped to a nearby Lowes, i bought a toilet and Adam had it installed by just past 9.  Seems very productive for an hour of work including shopping.

Adam was very polite and professional and answered all questions.  I would definitely use them again.< /review><user>113424488058311800094< /user><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>5<//rating></record>

Alex and Peter did a great job installing a new faucet in our laundry room, which had been causing a leak. They were courteous and friendly and even fed our neighbors chickens some sunflower seeds :)< /review>

Worst plumber ever! Needed a drain fixed now I have two new leaks underneath my bathroom sink and the could not repair my shower and also have a new leaking shower. Tech spent over 6 hours and didn't do a good job 0/10 srtars and I even showed him half way through where it was leaking. Called them to come back out and they cancelled last min! Worst plumbers ever hands down do not use them and I'm a retired insurance agent from Farmers Insurance!!!!< /Review>

It was an excellent service they did. I called 5 Star Plumbing and Peter answered the call and he was also the one who did the plumbing works in our house. They came on time, and charge me, of what was quoted on the phone. Peter finished the plumbing works within half of the day.</review>

<Text>5 star came out to fix a puncture in a 1 inch Pex water pipe in the wall. The wall was open and all prepped and ready to just cut, add couplings and fitting. The two  workers were at my house for approximately 10 minutes. My bill was $290. This is ridiculous. However I needed it fixed so I paid the price.  I have had Armstrong plumbing come out to fix Pex lines in the past and they charged me $150 for the same exact job.  Unfortunately,  because Armstrong plumbing is so busy,  they couldn't get out to fix it until the following week. If you have time to wait,  which I did not,  call Armstrong Plumbing. SORRY 5-STAR. NO MORE BUSINESS FROM ME. This review is for price only. The work was done complete and professional.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Our sink had a leak and I thought it was just a minor fix in which I can do on my own but it wasn’t. It was caused by two tubes not being properly connected. I called 5 Star Plumbing and their customer service was very responsive and they sent Joe. The fix took like less than an hour and the price was very reasonable. I'm glad the problem was resolved and I highly recommend this company to everyone.</Text>

I contacted 5 star plumbing after hours when I noticed a water leak in our front yard. Our water-heater started hissing and water was going all over the place. Paul came out and shut it off and drained it. He then scheduled an appointment to replace it the very next day. He and Oleg came out the next day and installed a new water-heater. They did a great job, it’s been a few days now and we’re very satisfied of their services. We would recommend them to anyone.< /review>

A young man name Peter from 5 Star Plumbing came out to work on my plumbing which had backed up . He was a true professional to deal with! When I told him what my problem was, he jumped on it and had the issue fixed in no time ! I would use these guys again in a heart beat !<//Review>

<text>Had a wonderful experience with 5 Star Plumbing. Oleg and Peter came out to install a new water heater in my house in Sac. Even though the process was long and tough as I live in an older home, they made it look very neat at the end. Very reasonable priced, would recommend.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x809b20ad1d0d65bf:0xa3f2214bbea28b92<//Gmap_id></record>

First i requested service to fix the simple water leak under the sink. After they fixed and left, tenant informed me that now there is a leak from the water heater. They insisted that it had nothing to do with what they fixed but they turned off the valve from the water heater to shut off the water. They requested additional $350 to fix the leak from waterheater which i regretly agreed to pay. Today they went back to fix the valve. Tenant informed me just now the waterheater is completly not working and service guys just left without even talking to her. I am shocked. I am filing complaints to the consumers affair and possibly make a lawsuit agsinst them.</Text>

We were having issues with our toilet and sink. And after calling, a tech came within an hour. He explained the issue and walked us through our options. Price was very fair and he didn't try to up sell or pressure me to pay for things I didn't need. Would use again in the future.<//text>

<Text>So happy I chose these guys, they did a water heater tank to tankless water heater conversion for me, I felt like I can trust them from the beginning when Peter came out to provide me with an estimate, he did not try to up-sell me anything. Dimas and Max came out a few days later and performed the installation, all in one day! Passed inspection on first try. Really impressed with the honesty and quality work. Best plumbers I’ve ve had to deal with by far!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I had a water heater leak, so I called 5-star plumbing. I talked to Peter and set up an appointment for the next day at 10 a.m. The next day a plumber by name Oleg shows up sharp at 9:00 a.m. This guy looked very neat, professional and was courteous. He took a look at my water heater and suggested to replace it. Thanks to him and his pleasant service now I have the tankless water system, I save energy. I am very pleased with 5-star plumbing services and hands down will do business again. I highly recommend them.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Wow, could not be happier with the service. The office person really took the time to hear me out, told me about all my options, very affordable prices. Plumber who came out, i forget his name, sorry, was really kind, wore shoe covers in the house. Overall great plumbing company.<//text>

<review>Made a nightmare into a not so bad experience. After an inspection realized my house has Kitec. 5 star plumbing gave me a very competitive bid. They did a wondeful job at repiping the house, passed inspection the first try. Good job guys.< /review>< user_name>

Calling this company was a waste of time.  The two people sent didn’t care about the plumbing issue and had poor attitudes.</text>
