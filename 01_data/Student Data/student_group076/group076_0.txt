I'd say the staff are quite helpful and courteous. I've only had one pharmacy cashier be a bit curt to someone in front of me. I usually visit the pharmacy and flash my receipt to the checker in the front as I leave. I'm always greeted with a smile.</Review>

<text>The only pharmacy in town that could figure out how to run my insurance - I went to half a dozen locations, it was a nightmare because the medication was quite expensive. Special thank you to Marian T. She really went the extra mile, from finding my prescription plan and trying very hard to find any kind of way to help me. I'm very grateful, thank you.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Normally I always listen to the ratings so I wasn’t expecting great service. I’ve had a lot of trouble getting my medications but the pharmacy staff have been wonderful at working with me through the difficulties getting things authorized by the insurance. I felt very cared about there and I noticed they do the same for many others. I feel like rather than telling me there was nothing they could do and was not their problem (disconnected like so many are today), they actually took the time to call my doctor, talk to my insurance, and try to get everything all sorted out. Even if the rules were blocking me from getting me the medication I needed, they allowed me a few until everything got sorted through so I didn’t have to miss a dose. They are human and in a world full of beurocracy, this was a welcome surprise.<//Text>

I have been here multiple times, over several years. The store is as expected. However, when it comes to the pharmacy it seems very few, including the pharmacist, know what they are doing, along with a very poor attitude. It seems they always have an excuse as to why they cannot fill a prescription, at best for hours at worst days. Typically, when you bring in a prescription, you need it then not days later.</Text>

<Text>The store is ok but my experience with the pharmacy is by far the worst. Poor customer service, long lines, staff is extremely unprofessional! The one on landless is so much better. The staff here definitely needs proper corporate training.<//Text>< name>

<Text>Took 3 days to tell that we can not provide specific compounding oinment. We submitted our prescription on 6th June and doctor said that it will be ready by tomorrow. When we called next day on June 7th, they said our computers are not working, we will contact you. On June 8th we got a call to tell that we dont provide this oinment. Wow !!< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Got a text about  11:00 saying RX was ready .About 5pm I went to pickup antibiotics for my granddaughter who had been discharged just that morning from emergency room.Many customers ahead of me and  after waiting in line for 15 -20 min. I was told by a pharmacist assistant that Doctor had made a mistake on RX and she needed to call him. I told her we needed the RX filled because Granddaughter  was in pain and she stated that she couldn't be in pain because she had been given pain meds that morning. (Implying that Granddaughter should be popping pain pills)
We asked for RX back so we could go elsewhere which is when she realized that
Doctor had faxed over a revised RX but that one had been filed away without being filled.
After waiting another 10 min I was given the the pills but not before being told that if that ever happened again I would have to wait the usual waiting time (which could be hours.) Seems mistakes happen often at this pharmacy!
I told her this was their mistake not mine and she proceeded to tell me to next time go to another store.
Mind you not once did she ever make eye contact with me . The whole time she proceeded to talk at me not with me.
She was not only unprofessional and rude but you could tell she was frazzled
by how busy it gets.
She definitely needs to get another job where she has no customer contact because after reading the other reviews I can see this behavior is being tolerated by the store.</Review>

As I'm texting this another lady is complaining about the same thing and that it happens all the time. I found a CVS right around the corner (or many in the area)< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

They were able to schedule an appointment around my work schedule which was extremely important to me.  Dr. Kleis was very thorough in going over all my options.  He was very helpful in answering all my questions.  They had the equipment in the office so that I could get an immediate opinion on my issues.  The staff was extremely friendly!<//review>

I love this place! I am a physician and I know how hard it is to run a good, efficient clinic like his. The staff was very pleasant and Dr. Jeffrey Kleis is very knowledgeable and was able to help me with a minor skin condition.  I used the prescription he gave me and it was cleared up in a week. I would definitely recommend his services.</text>

I visited and seen Dr. Jeffrey Kleis for ankle pain and he was very professional, took time to understand my ailment, and quickly determined a solution for my problem. In no time, I was pain free.
The clinic smoothly. I was greeted by a professional team and was seen on time. Highly recommend him.</Text>

I went to Dr. Kleis as a last hope to fix my foot and ankle problems. My ankle was collapsing inward and I had extreme pain walking. He repaired the posterior tibial tendon and manipulated the foot and ankle to restore a normal appearance and a normal walk. I was in a cast for two months and one month more with a removable boot. I can't thank him enough for restoring my foot to normality. It is about 2 years since the surgery and still good.</review>

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Dr. Kleis and the entire staff. From the moment I walked in the door on my first visit everyone was so kind, caring and welcoming. My daughter was born with clubfeet and when several other doctors wouldn't give me the time of day in talking to me prior to her being born, Dr. Kleis spent over an hour on the phone with me answering every single question I had. We travel five hours each way for appointments, but it is completely worth it. I know my daughter has received the best care, and I am so grateful knowing he will be able to run and walk thanks to Dr. Kleis.<//review>

<Text>Dr Kleis was amazing! He immediately diagnosed and treated a small torn ligament with an anti inflammatory, laser treatment and sports tape to keep it from moving. Only wish I would of found him first.
The first Podiatrist I saw barely looked at my foot and recommend an MRI, which ended up taking 4 weeks because his front office gave the MRI lab incomplete Insurance info. Meanwhile I was making the tear worse, no therapy, no tape, nothing.</Text><UserId.>115814254166153070248< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<text>I would agree that the office is nice, clean, and staff is professional. However, the treatment did nothing for me. I was told to return after 6 weeks for a check up and additional treatment (at additional cost) if needed. I would have gone but the first treatment showed absolutely no improvement and I don't have the money to through away on treatments that show no promise.</text>< Pictures>

I Had a great experience with Dr. Kleis! He was super nice and listened to me as I babble about my pain. He wanted to solve the problem not just give me a prescription! Also The office staff was really nice and super discrete when i arrived for my appt. I came in with really painful feet , which i found out was plantar facialitis ...lol dont know if i spelled that right. I did a few treatments of the shock wave , which no other doc has ever mentioned to me existed!!! It did miricales after just a few visits and i am running again pain free. Really couldn't have asked for more!<//Review>

<username>Rodrigo Calix - Lopez< /username><text>This place has the worst customer service. I called and asked if they had icy hot and the lady over the phone told me she “thinks there is but she’s not sure”. Before she got another word out of me she starts raising her voice and telling me. “Yeah I’m not going to the isle. I can’t go over there today. I don’t have time to go and see if we do or don’t have it. So I’m not going to the isle to check”. My GF is in the back yelling in pain and I’m panicked because I already don’t know what’s going on with her and I have this lady telling me she can’t check or have someone check and I live about 5 miles away. I couldn’t leave my GF like that to go see if they had it. Save your time and go to the one on Cleveland. Never coming here again. Bye to a great customer.😩<//text><Time>1574904224303<//Time><rating>1< /rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

Not the best location. But today my daughter was having her school recital, and it so happens that my 9 month old drenches her socks in water, with only 30 minutes left to her recital to start I head over to the dollar tree. I go in and I start to panic because I think that their isn't anymore Christmas socks. So I ended up asking one of the workers In their. She then goes above and beyond to find them. Turns out they had a few left, so I purchased  the red ones. I appreciated the workers that helped me get what I needed just in time for my daughter's recital.</Review>

It was nice that they made me laugh a few times through the pain free procedure. Dr. Peters does such a great job at numbing the area.  I like everyone avoids the dentist but now I won’t. The entire office staff all seem so happy that it left a good impression on me.  I’ll be back.< /Text>< Pictures>

From the moment you walk in you are greeted with smiling, friendly faces!

Since I was i kid the scariest place for me,  was and is the dentist still!  and I'm grown now. Dr. Ocampo and his staff have taken that scary feeling away from me. Their professionalism and their caring and trustworthy approach make me feel like I'm in great hands🙌 alway a great experience 👌<//review>

< Review>
I have been seeing Dr Ocampos for years now.
I go to him because hes a nice guy and and he builds a relationship with his patients, most importantly he does detail work that's painless. When he refures patients out for special work, he always sends me to the best.
He has a great staff that's been working there for years with lots of experience. When you see the same faces for years this tells you that their Owner Dr Ocampos definently treats his employees right and just values his people and his patients. I just referred my Father and he had a great experience and he told me Dr Ocampos is very detail and staff is great.<//Review>

<review>Dr. Ocampo and his staff are very professional, courteous, and skilled. No matter how minor or major the procedure you have, you walk out knowing that the work performed is top notch. I highly recommend Dr. Ocampo and his practice. Theresa in the office will be more than happy to assist. Gema and Theresa have been nothing but helpful and reassuring.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmap_id>0x80dd2b3626f4422f:0x41404dc1f6fda74e<//gmap_id>< Rating>

Very happy with my work done here at Imperial Dental! The receptionist is very thorough and always makes sure to call and check in on our appointment. I Had the pleasure of getting work done by Dr. Ocampo and Dr. Drewal! Never have I been so satisfied with the numbing process. Usually I’d still feel a little pain, or have to get a second dosage, but not here. The initial dosage lasted me the whole procedure without any problems or pain. They never left me alone for long periods of time, and got done in a timely manner. Very happy with the root canal and crown I received, I look forward to my next procedure next month, Thank you Imperial Dental!</Text>

Dr. Ocampo has been our family dentist for the past 27 years. He has taken care of my wife and our three boys. He is like family to us.  Terry at the front desk always has a welcoming smile to put you at ease.  I cannot say enough about the exceptional service we have always received from Dr. Ocampo and his staff. If your looking for a dentist, look no further. I definitely recommend him!</Review>

I came in without and appointment and I was squeezed in. The staff is very friendly and the Dr was very informative. I got a great cleaning and was referred to an oral surgeon. I was recommended here by my girlfriend and am going to make this my “go to” orthodontist.<//review>

<review>This is by far the best office I’ve ever been to.  As soon as you walk into the office you feel welcomed. The staff at reception greet you with a smile and a sincere feeling of seeing you. They make you feel like you’re among friends.
The reception area is clean and warm with nice decor.
As soon as they bring you to the back the doctors and assistants make you feel comfortable with no pressure and no worries.
The doctors have a very smooth touch not like other offices where they stab you and hurt you. I’ve never had a bad experience at Dr. Ocampo’s  office. The assistants have extensive experience and knowledge and it shows when you’re having any procedure done.
I love coming to this office because I know they will take good care of me.
If you need a really great doctor and no pressure just come by and try this amazing office.
I will always recommend Dr. Ocampo’s office and all the friendly staff!
Thanks for taking care of me!</review>< date>

I absolutely love coming to Dr Ocampo’s office. He is the gentlest dentist I have every had. Even my kids prefer to see him above all others. And his staff is completely professional and very nice. The waiting room is very calming. I almost want to nap as I wait a few minutes for my appointment. Dr Ocampo takes his time to explain procedures and answer any questions. The office is very clean and welcoming. During this time of COVID-19 they are being very careful with all of their patients, making sure people are separated and wearing masks up until they have to “go in”.< /review>

During the exam, the dentist wanted to prove there was a space between a dental crown I had and my gum.
He proceeded to place dental floss between the gum and the crown and pulled down forcefully.
I was absolutely shocked.
He also told me I had to get at least 2 others crowns and was going to charge an exorbitant amount of money.
Felt like I was being sold a used car.
The small filling that I came in for was not covered by the insurance I had because it was deemed "cosmetic" and I ended up having to pay $250.
Ridiculous.
Got much better insurance and a dentist that wasn't a con artist and am much happier.
Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this practice.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

< review>
I have been a patient since I was a little girl. Dr. O’Campo and his staff are caring, trusting, and professional. I’m now in my early 30s and I can’t imagine going anywhere else for my dental needs. Years ago I suffered a car accident and sustain many injuries; one of them was braking my jaw in two places. Since then, every time I have had any dental work done Dr. O’Campo makes sure I get breaks and uses a mouth guard so my jaw doesn’t get overworked or tired. His wonderful staff has been amazing throughout the years. Gema and Terri are phenomenal woman and amazing in their patient care. If your near the La Mirada Area and are looking for an outstanding dentist and kind staff, then come here to Imperial Dental Dr. O’Campo’s Office< /review>

< review>
Recently had an appointment for a routine check up and I must say as soon as I arrived the staff was very welcoming. Was soon met by doctor Ocampo which I must say did an excellent job, I left happy and smiling ! As some one who has never had trust in dentist Doctor Ocampo has forever changed my perspective about going to the dentist he has gained a customer for life !</review>

<text>Worst dental office I ever been.  Went for a cleaning the they suggested a bunch of things that I need to get done for almost $6,000 and when I told them that I wanted to do the cleaning that is covered by the insurance they did it in 15 minutes (of course a really bad job).  When I got out my teeth were feeling like sand paper.</text>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) Meticulous, with great knowledge, he explains the procedures well and with such a humane treatment. I feel very lucky to have found a great dentist.

<review>Nachos were cold. HOW?! Ceviche was O.K service was O.K I mean you're personally better off with a cocktail, the ambiance is neat and some guac and chips. Not as good as I remember it being.<//review>< user>

<Text>My friends and I came here from out of state and were expecting really great things from a restaurant in Beverly hills. We had very high hopes and it turned out the food here was subpar if you can really consider it that even. The enchiladas were ordered by 3 of us and all 3 of us could not stomach eating it. The food was atrocious and the busboy or server came and was cleaning up and never even bothered to ask how the food was before picking up our plates that were obviously full of food not even eaten. The waiter then came to find only one of the 3 enchilada entrees was still left to be picked up by a busboy or server. And asked the golden question " Was everything good?" My friends and I all informed him that we were unhappy with the meal and he decided to offer compensation for only one of the enchilada meals even though all 3 of us literally ate a bite or so of it. So I was punished by paying for food that was no where near the level of where it should be considering the area the restaurant was at. Had the busboy or server did their job and informed the chef or waiter of the fact that none of us actually ate the food then we wouldn't have been stuck paying for food that we all disliked. We only managed to get one of the enchilada meals removed from the bill but that was only because we got lucky that the worker wasn't able to carry all the plates and left that one behind and in turn it was seen by the waiter.< /Text>< resp>

Figure we'd give it a try. Hardly anyone one there, maybe 12 people including our party,when we were there dining outdoors. Service was slow, food mediocre and cold when arrived ,portions small. Over priced for an overall "meh" experience. Not a good way to open back up after the covid shut down.</Review>

I thought this place had some pretty nice Hispanic flavors, the green salsa was a little to salty. I has enchiladas suizas and the chicken was tender... just a little expensive but HEY, you are in LA!</Text>

<review>Every dish we had was perfect. The Frida platter is a great starter with mini flautas, quesadillas, and pupusas. The enchiladas tapatias have the most delicious red sauce. Steak tacos are another great choice. Everything was worth the rave.

The restaurant is clean, service was great, prices not too bad for Beverly Hills. I’d definitely go back.</review></record>

< Review>
Underwhelming.  They suggested the table side guacamole, which is basically them throwing in all of the ingredients and mixing it together with a spoon. It was a 1 minute show.  They could have done that in the kitchen and just brought it out because it wasn’t anything special.  I ordered the skirt steak tacos and most of the meat was burnt to a crisp.  For $20, it certainly wasn’t worth it.  The only redeeming quality of this location was that parking was surprisingly easy to find.< /Review>

<review>Hands down best mexican food  in Beverly Hills. Great service, great food, good prices! My husband got  chili chicken and soup, and he said it was amazing.The server assistants and servers were really on it. You can tell they are all hard workers. We were pretty hungry and went through the chips and salsa pretty fast, and they were replaced before we could even ask.
If you like good Mexican, go here, weekends there's always a wait, but it's worth it.< /review><gmapID>0x80c2bbfbf52c5fc3:0xe17c36c86833ef1f< /gmapID>< user_id>

I had their Black Truffle Old Fashion ($15), which was Union mezcal with Italian black truffle.  I will admit that
those two ingredients itself enticed me (mostly the black truffle), but it wasn't all that special to me.  I came in only wanting one drink, but because the Black Truffle Old Fashion didn't serve me justice, I had to order another.< /text>< username>

A++ place to eat at. Seated quickly on a Thursday night, staff was attentive- Drink refills were done automatically and stealthily, variety of food was excellent. Food itself was delicious and well portioned for the price. Desert (crepes) was also very delicious.< /review>

<date>1560570921845<//date><review>The food was...good. I think it was close to Mexican food but it needed some...humpf? Like more flavor. It was mild. Some flavors were tangy and sweet (weird combo on an enchilada but good on the chicken) or it wasn't salty enough.

However, the lava cake was delicious!! Very chocolatey and heavenly! I recommend it.<//review>< user>

They gave us chips and salsa also. Overall a nice dinner and atmosphere! The restaurant is on the small side but also has outside seating. The rice was flavorful but alittle dry.

I really enjoyed Frida's. The table-side guac was delicious. I had the shrimp and rice with the garlic wine butter sauce. It was very flavorful and a nice sized portion with great presentation. I will definitely be back to try out the taco sampler plate.</Review>

In anticipation of celebrating Cinco de Mayo this evening, I placed a to-go order this afternoon to avoid the 5pm rush.  I ordered 5 entrees, sides, dessert, etc. with a lovely lady and told her I would pick everything up at 6:15 pm.  When I arrived at the restaurant it was TOTAL CHAOS.  There was no organization as to which person was "next" in the queue and from the outside I could see bags of food placed all over the interior of the restaurant.  People were literally grazing from bag to bag, touching the exteriors, reaching into the inside, etc. There was a man at the register allowing the craziness to continue.  It took me between 15-20 minutes to reach him and when I asked for my order he told me that there was no order.  I explained that I had spoken with a lady earlier in the day; he emphatically claimed that there was "no woman" at the restaurant and that I must have confused the restaurant with another Frida several blocks away.  30 minutes after I parked, I had to jump in the car and, again, wait in line for someone to greet me.  At the other Frida (Cantina) there was no record of my order and, after closer inspection of the menu, I realized that it could not have been correct restaurant.  I repeatedly called the "right" restaurant on my way to Chipotle (what other choice did I have after 7pm on Cinco de Mayo??)  and was sent straight to voicemail.  When I arrived home I immediately checked my credit card statement ... there it was, charge for $169.13 from the Frida Restaurant on South Beverly Drive!  I called and called again and nobody would answer!!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!</review><Rating>1< /Rating><Date>1588734591491</Date></record></dataset><record>

THE BEST Mexican food around. I thought it was not going to be authentic cause it looks a little fancy but man was I wrong!!! It’s as close as authentic as you can get of course nothing beats Mexico but WOW! The Nachos with carne asada DELICIOUS, the tacos DELICIOUS. It was so good I had to get desert and I’m not a sweets person. I was just curious about the churros but even that delivered! Everything have my taste buds everything it needed! I HUGHLY recommend. I also enjoyed the music and positive vibes. It was a full house and the meals still Came out good and did not take long. Very impressed and extremely happy!< /Text>

<text>Never a good sign when your food comes out two minutes after you order. Burrito was a blob of refried beans and low quality meat, mango salad was missing the caramelized nuts and cheese. Do not recommend.< /text>< time>

Food was delicious. Portions are plentiful. Service was excellent. Place was Lively but a little too noisy. Had a family next to me with screaming kids and the restaurant did nothing to stop them hence the one missing star. Otherwise everything was done real well.<//Text>

Cute place and good food but pretty over priced!! I guess that’s because it’s in Beverly Hills. I would suggest happy hour stop in because the margaritas are large and strong. Really yummy guacamole, but just be prepared to spend more than you probably want to.<//review>

There was 16 of us at the table. We should have had three tickets. The waiter messed up our ticket for three times in a row.  It was Friday night we were all tired we wanted to leave and we couldn't because we had to wait like 40 minutes for this waiters to correct the ticket.   bad service.  The one in Glendale is much better.  Their service is great the food is even better and the place is much bigger. Being in Beverly Hills I really was very disappointed.  I really thought it was going to be a fantastic place to eat and have great service but it turned out the opposite.< /text>

Massive menu at this place made it difficult to choose just one entrée for dinner. Made at your table guacamole was excellent, as was everything we chose for dinner. Would highly recommend this place for great, authentic Mexican food in an area you might not expect it.<//text>

I have the Filet dish when l go there.  The Micholadas are AMAZING!!! I don't remember the name, they have different ones so l just ask for the "normal pne" and l slurp away!! Soooo good!  The guacamole is delicious too.  Creamy and smooth and very flavorful.  It's a very happy place, l have enjoyed my many visits!!< /Text>

Wow! WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!! BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!! Rude waiter, argued with me for several minutes when he brought me the wrong dish. He said "I mean, I will take it off your bill but this IS what you ordered" and NO it wasn't what I ordered. He was wrong but was arguing with me because he had poor listening skills..  He was the waiter that was a very short man working the patio last night around 6pm. He should probably find a new line of work.. I should add that I had to have my ten year old son walk up to the hostess stand to request our check as the waiter ignored us the rest of our meal after his fit of arguing back and forth with me. Poor listening skills and waiting tables isn't a good fit. Hopefully he finds a new line of work. It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant in my entire life. That waiter was a very smug little man.< /Text>

Great all around restaurant and staff.  If you love tequila, ask about their sangrita, their own recipe of chasers that is delicious.  Hang out with a couple of friends at the tables outside for people watching and an early dinner or cocktails.< /Review>

I found this place on google. Thought we'd give it a try. They accommodated a party of 12, with same day reservation. I really enjoyed the food. If I lived closer,  I'd return!</Text>

<Text>The food was delicious. The table service was great and even the manger stopped at our table to greet us which is unusual in a restaurant unless there is some type of problem.  The atmosphere was very loud. This location is small, so there is not room for booths or more privacy when dining. The bathroom was clean and stocked. The lava cake was a little dry, the ice cream was melted, and no chocolate sauce which a lava cake is suppose to have. The tea was fresh and they refilled our glasses with good timing. I would eat here again and recommend this establishment to others. Update: Well I ate here again, but did not have the same experience the second time around. The service was lousy this time. Our waitress acted like we had offended her by bothering to eat there. We could not get her attention and finally had to stop a waiter to ask for drink refills. Everyone has a bad day, but considering how pricey the food is here, the service should 100% match. I felt like apologizing to the waitress for bothering to stop by that night. No customer should be made to feel this way.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Food was AMAZING.... absolutely delicious. I got the burrito and my wife got the seared tuna salad and they both were solid choices. I highly recommend checking this place out the next time you are in or around Beverly Hills.</text>

<text>Fake Mexican. The only thing authentic about this place is the waiters.  I had Mole Poblano. On the menu it says "Chicken simmered in a chile chocolate sauce." This is a lie. The chicken is a tasteless chicken breast with mole sauce poured on top. There is no simmering involved.  Completely bland and inauthentic. I asked the waiter if it was always like this. He nodded and departed.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Although I'm not eating pork anymore Frida's has some of the best carnitas tacos around. Their Taco Tuesday is pretty hard to beat. And their margaritas are delicious!</Text>

The tacos de rib eye were heavenly! The steak was like butter in my mouth! Just a complete explosion of flavors! LOVED IT! The service was decent and the food came out in a timely manner. The atmosphere was relaxed. MaryYourSoul(dot)com< /Text>

I’ve been a client of this location for several years; service always has been good however I noticed that recently portions are smaller, tacos are very small and only served with one very thin tortilla and if you want double tortilla as normally small tacos are served everywhere they say have to charge you extra for double tortilla, that’s no bueno, tortillas are very cheap to get. I think food is ok but definitely pricey for what it is.< /review>

Not what I was accepting. My first time at that restaurant. It was over priced for the portion they serve. I ordered shrimp fijita it had only 5 pieces of shrimp for $28 . I ordered cevecheh, it was some cabbage with lots of water and few small pieces of fish. I will not go there again. They give 3 small pieces of tortilla and if u ask for more they charge you for it</Text>

<Text>alas, if only the food could live up to the setting. high priced latin cuisine served by attentive staff, the restaurant displays some promise. however, the wildly inconsistent fare leaves one wanting more and less of a bill for that as well.< /Text><user>110009487837927233489<//user><Resp>None<//Resp><rating>3< /rating><gmap_id>0x80c2bbfbf52c5fc3:0xe17c36c86833ef1f< /gmap_id>< Date>

<response>None</response><text>Great atmosphere, good tasting Mexican flavored food in Beverly hills,  of all places, not cheap, but well worth it for a night out, casual, valet at the front, very convenient, a bit loud if ur planning on having a quiet conversation,  but other than that, not a bad place to get drinks and some Mexican food<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bbfbf52c5fc3:0xe17c36c86833ef1f</Gmap_id>< Rating>

Service was extremely slow and the restaurant wasn't even busy, food took over an hour to arrive at the table. Food made me throw up ; literally. I'd pass on this restaurant if I were you. I'm certainly never going here again.<//review>

I’ve been coming to Edgar for upgrades, network help, phone bill, questions, all of the above for many years… Edgar knows what he is doing and answers and solve all issues that I have. Very friendly, makes you feel confident in using ATT network. If you are in the area and have ATT questions, upgrades come see Edgar. He will take care of you and make sure you leave happy. This customer service is a 1000/10.<//Review>

<review>This AT&T store hidden in North Stockton, California location next to Firehouse Subs is WAY BETTER than the other AT&T store near the Xfinity/Comcast store. The very knowledgeable employee helping me was named Paul. Oh, the BEST PART about this store is that it is a well-kept secret, so there was NO WAITING FOR WALK-IN SERVICE. The only reasons why it earns 4/5 Stars: a homeless man asking for spare change in the parking lot, and there was no wake-up kiosk to make payments.</review><username>Stripes Cat</username><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPu7VvXlpwi_pl_EqI5ngQE-tu-hMbZ0qT5oBk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><rate>4</rate><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80900c917f704bd7:0x34355a45cb685c2f<//gmapID>< userid>

This store was marvelous! Both of the reps Edgar and Bryan greeted me with a warm friendly smile and made me feel more than welcomed. After multiple attempts to have AT&T remove the line of my father who just recently passed away., both reps were super comforting, made me feel at home and promised me I would not leave the store without getting this done for me. They went above and beyond for my family and I and that's why I will pick this store over any regardless of the hour drive from Valley Springs!< /Text>

I have come to these guys for the last couple of years. They have always come thru with not only excellent service but truly look at my needs and have gotten me the best deals for every need that I may have and have never missed the mark. I can even come back to just pay a bill and they will inquire how things are and even check to make sure I am getting all my needs met. I can can just say other people could take a page from these guys on how to treat a customer and deliver..</Text>

<review>The female rep in the store on 7860 West Lane, Stockton, CA  was very rude and unwilling to assist.. she is the only female working.... called customer service which took 40 mins to correct the in store reps mistake.

I love my phone, watch and connectivity I receive.  I am extremely disappointed with the in store service... not pleased and will not return again..</review><user_name>melissa shoat</user_name>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Caution !! With the workers of this store HERE THEY LIKE TO SCAM! Camilo & Edgar.
I came to do a promotion where you change your device and they give you an iPhone pro max in exchange, as it turns out that these people opened a phone line (which I do not authorize) which appears in the image below 👇 that apparently they put the more expensive line and with all the services, (and I repeat I did not authorize such a fact.) and it turns out that instead of activating my phone on my existing line! They put the financing of the phone to the line they created, the line chip was never given to me, they put the chip in the iPhone case and much less told me that they had activated a new line, I confidently signed the papers Now I am without a new iPhone and without my old iPhone! Since if I was left with the iPhone I would have to pay $ 60 dollars for the line and $ 30 dollars for the phone! I also lost the taxes I gave for the phone, $ 140 and $ 50 for returning the phone.
Thank you very much Edgar and Camilo !!! For your excellent service !!!!! They are the most dishonest people I have ever met! And by making several calls to At & T I realized his dirty move !!
This store is not within the at & t corporate, if you want not to be scammed, call at & t and have them make an appointment for you at a corporate store !! If you do this you will get away with being scammed!

(Original)
Precaución !! Con los trabajadores de esta tienda AQUÍ LES GUSTAN ESTAFAR !! Camilo & Edgar.
Vine hacer efecto una promoción en donde cambias tu dispositivo y te dan a cambio un iPhone pro max, pues resulta que estas personas abrieron una línea de teléfono (que yo no autorizo)   El cual aparece en la imagen de abajo 👇 que al parecer pusieron la línea más cara y con todos los servicios, ( y repito yo no autoríze tal hecho.) y resulta que en vez de activar mi teléfono en mi línea ya existente ! Pusieron la financiación del teléfono a la linea que  ellos crearon , el chip de la línea nunca me lo dieron en mis manos, pusieron el chip en la caja del  iPhone y mucho menos  me dijeron que habían activado una nueva línea  , yo confiada firme los papeles ahora me que de sin iPhone nuevo y sin mi iPhone viejo ! Ya que  si mi quedaba con el iPhone tendría que pagar $60 dólares por la línea y $30 dólares por el teléfono !!  Perdi también los taxes que di por  el teléfono, $140 y $50 dólares por regresar el teléfono .
Muchas gracias Edgar y Camilo !!! Por su excelente servicio!!!!! Son las personas más deshonestas que he conocido !!! Y al hacer varias llamadas a At&T me di cuenta de su sucia jugada!!
Esta tienda no está dentro del corporativo de at&t , si deceas no ser estafado , llama a at&t y que ellos te realicen una cita a una tienda de corporativo !! Si haces esto saldrás bien librado de ser estafado !</review>

<Text>I've had the opportunity to work with Noble Plumbing at our trampoline park in Modesto CA. They also inspected a new park in another nearby city. I work with vendors across the nation and Noble is one of the best I've used. They provide a high level of expertise and quickly solve every problem we've given them. They are fast, friendly, honest, and dependable all at a great price! I would highly recommend using Noble Plumbing for all plumbing needs. Thank you Noble Plumbing!</Text>< pictures>

Got a courtesy call 1 hour before scheduled time for the following day. Was on time.
Vince was dialed in, had everything he needed
Even with my 3/8” supply lines. Cut the old junk valves off, replaced with good gear.
Vince was very professional and experienced.

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>We have had leaks in PEX pipe between floors in our house. Vince from a Noble Plumbing did an excellent job of explaining what he was going to do, assessing the situation, and detailing his action plan. He kept me apprised every step of the way, and was very conscientious about his work. He explained what caused the problem and what future steps should be to completely alleviate it. Vince also changed the leaky shutoff valve outside and stopped a bath tub control knob from leaking. He was a true professional who took pride in his work and was very fantastic to work with.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Found a hole in the pipe under my sink. After looking online at top rated plumbers in Modesto, I decided to call Noble. They were able to schedule me for a time that was convenient for me and were actually able to come out earlier. The office people were super polite and helpful. I was worried that the problem was really severe and was preparing for a very expensive and massive repair, but the technician Tom explained that the problem was very small and he could do the repair quickly and at a reasonable price. Tom was great about explaining what he was doing and I felt really at ease. Will definitely be using Noble Plumbing again as needed in the future.< /Text>< pics>

He was very professional, informative and explained everything very well.  He completed his task in a timely manner. Nice to see that he was wearing a mask as we are not yet covid free.<//Text>

<text>Noble plumbing is made up of some the most friendly and professional people you could ever hope for.  Thank you to Cari, who answered my call and scheduled a technician to come out within the hour. Within an hour on a Saturday!  Anthony was here to help me out in less than an hour.  Anthony Is another professional. He did not seem to mind me hovering around asking questions. He answered all of them and explained what I did not know.

The two technicians that came to my house were prompt, professional, polite and knowledgeable. The price was reasonable. I’d recommend Noble Plumbing to my friends. If you’re fortunate, you’ll get Vince assigned to your job.< /Review>

I was thankful to have excellent help when needed. Noble Plumbing will take care of your plumbing problems. I was given excellent guidance by John on what to do right away with my emergency outdoor broken pipe when I made the first phone call.  I was served by a very polite,  professional  and diligent plumbing technician, Juan A. I feel really confident to recommend them for any plumbing needs.<//review>

<text>I called on a Sunday night expecting to be late to work on Monday because of a leak I caused while trying to fix a leak. My leak was fixed same day because Jonathan who answered the phone knew his one plumber working would be busy till late at night so he came and handled it asap. My water main has never looked and worked better and my wife and I could not be happier with the work he provided us on such emergency notice. I may still be late to work tomorrow, but that is because of the good night sleep I will have knowing my plumbing works proper.</text>< Pics>

Great meeting Brian, he was very professional and offered a great price for clearing my sewer lateral. Would highly recommend this company! Unbeatable prices compared to other businesses, with the same quality work! Thanks again Brian,

Never sent estimate I'm a contractor also and nothing peeves people more than meeting and not sending a price and wasting time.</text>
<pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1621709180026, 'text': 'Marty,\n\nThank you for your feedback. After looking into this situation, it appears that our technician didn\'t put together a free estimate for you because when he was on site, you informed him that you were already going with the same company you always use, and that\xa0our estimate was being used only as a "price comparison". Our technician didn\'t want to waste his time by putting together\xa0a free estimate after you informed him of that. (Also, we know and are friends with the folks at the plumbing company you normally use, and we don\'t want to undercut or step on their toes.)\n\nWith that being said, we believe you still should have gotten your free estimate anyway, regardless of what was discussed between you and the technician. It\'s not our policy that the technicians themselves get to pick and choose who gets a free estimate; this is something that will be addressed.\xa0We want to apologize for any inconvenience this\xa0has caused you, as we both know how busy the construction/repair industry is at\xa0the moment.\xa0If there\'s anything we can do to make this right please don\'t hesitate to let us know; we always want every customer left with a positive experience. We will be happy to have a supervisor speak with you and/or still get you that free estimate if you\'d like.'}</response><Gmap_id>0x809055c5f02a3411:0x1de1b23d269aac3e<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>John was very understanding of my issue over the phone at 5pm yesterday. He asked if I could wait until the next day for delivery & install and although it was my emergency... it wasn’t life threatening so I agreed. He offered 11:00 am to which I was thrilled. He showed up at 10:30 (call ahead placed by the office) and the whole job of removing old hot water tank and installing new only took about 1.5 hours. He was very polite and professional. He cleaned up the work area and hauled off the old tank and packaging of the new tank. He explained the warranties of (tank) and (install). If I could give 6  ⭐️ I would. I asked for a few business cards because if my tank went out then my neighbors aren’t far behind... and I plan to recommend Noble Plumbing!   Thanks John.

Robert, the plumber who came out to the house to fix a water leak that I though might be outside actually found it was one of the toilets in the house. He was extremely thorough and professional as well as friendly.
I had never tried Noble Plumbing before but would highly recommend them for any and all plumbing needs. Did I mention the price Noble charged was much less than I expected. And Yes...they do give senior discounts.
Thank you Noble Plumbing for being an asset to our community. If ever we need a plumber again we know exactly who to call.

Noble Plumbing found the problem immediately when our sewer pipe backed up. Using a camera they showed us why there was a clogging and gave us an estimate but didn’t pressure us to get the work done.
We decided to have them fix the pipe issue which they did in one day. They were very professional and informative and cleaned our yard up nicely when they were finished. I would recommend them  for your plumbing needs.< /text>

Had a major leak in a main line that needed attention fast. I called Noble Plumbing and their response time was impeccable.Kumar responded shortly after I made the initial call. He was able to identify the issue and was professional the entire process. The communication that he had with my wife and I was on point and left us satisfied with the hard work he and his colleagues put in. I would definitely use their services again and recommend using them to neighbors and friends in the area for  plumbing solutions!</Review>

< Review>
The price was higher than what I was quoted initially. I needed a kitchen faucet replaced. The receptionist was very friendly, said there would be no charge for coming out. However the technician said if he had to look at the issue, there would be a charge. Kind of conflicting as to what the receptionist communicated.
The day the tech gave a quote, I asked what type of faucet would be a good fit. He recommended buying any other brand than the one I had. I purchased a PriceFister.
After the install the technician said the charge is higher because of the type of faucet and that he had to apply caulking around to seal.
Isn't that what an install involves??? Not happy!!
I chose this company because of the convenience to my home but next time going to go with someone else.< /Review>

{'time': 1580057073440, 'text': "Ms Pearson,\nBefore accusing our company of such behavior I'd like to give you a few facts that maybe your not aware of and or didn't mention in your review.\n\n#1, We were out to your neighbors house before the septic company. We were the ones who recommended her to call them out.\n#2.  The septic company pumped her tank, found that her tank was broken, (which is true, we have pictues)and left her backed up. Also told her she had roots in her line.  They told her to call a plumbing company.\n#3 Your neighbor called us back with this report from her septic company. Said her septic  tank was pumped,  septic company told her she needed a new tank and that she had roots in her line. We then sent a second plumber that night to look into it.\n#4 A broken septic tank will no longer work, it will for a while but she'll be having to pump her tank really soon and frequent which could get costly.  Our senior tech was scheduled to meet with her the day she canceled to give her an estimate on replacing tank. She was also given an estimate to replace her sewer line since we were already talking about replacing her septic tank. She also had no clean out for us to camera or snake her sewer line.\n#5 Our recommendation was based off your neighbors report as well as the Septic company's report.  We were also giving her a permanent solution to her problem. Not offering a band aid.\nThen next thing we know she calls septic company back out and we're the bad guys?.\n\nIn no way were we trying to take advantage of your neighbor. We wouldn't have told her to call a septic company if we were trying to scam her. I feel that you were misinformed on this whole situation.  That said, I  really do apologize for any misunderstanding. Shes a sweet lady,  I had the privilege of speaking to her the following day about this matter.  She said she was happy with our company and would still use us but didn't like the technician who recommended her sewer line replacement. I do understand how she could  be upset but hope she knows it was completely unintentional.  I blame no one in this situation, just a big misunderstanding.  I wish your neighbor the best with her plumbing,  and please do not hesitate to call us or use us again in the future! Ill be more than happy to help you myself. We have many great plumbers in our company and your experience with one should not make you feel or think a certain way about who we all are.\n\nJon T."}</Resp>

Our water heater went out late on a Thursday night and our plumber was out of town for a few days. We called Noble Friday morning and by the evening we had a new one installed. Jon was very professional over the phone and delivered exactly as promised. Edgar came out to do the work and he did a great job. He was extremely polite and knowledgeable, he explained exactly what he did and how the water heater worked. We will  call Noble in the future without hesitation should we have any plumbing problems.<//Review>

<review>I had a plumbing issue that needed to be fixed quickly, called Nobel Plumbing on Saturday morning and they were out in the afternoon. The call staff was excellent. Roger and Christopher arrived on time and did an amazing job. They took the time and care to do everything right with quality craftsmanship and a personal touch as if they were working on their own home.  Excellent.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809055c5f02a3411:0x1de1b23d269aac3e</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I would definitely recommend Nobel Plumbing to all of my friends and family. Not only did they come out to me right away they got the job done what others couldn’t. Very friendly and professional staff it was so quick and easy to call them and get someone out to me. Their prices are reasonable and affordable they really take care of you with whatever you need. If anyone is looking for any plumbing service they are where it’s at. 10/10 service!</text>

Edgar came out around 11pm and tried to clear the main line, when that didn't work he had to pull a toilet off and snake it. He worked hard until almost 1:30am. He was very professional and very personable. The children will be happy when they wake up and are able to go potty.<//Review>< Name>

most rude plumbing company Ive ever dealt with. the plumbers themselves are lazy I had a water heater replaced the plumber didn’t strap it down so he had to come back an fix it which was a recall so I had to take time out of my day to have them come back and fix it the problem but this wasn’t the first time I had this problem with this company Before i went through them a year ago and had the same problem but I thought, hey people make mistakes so I messed up by calling them again I wouldn’t recommend this sloppy company to anyone.. I went through sin cal a couple days ago and hey they were 10X BETTER good luck with these guys if you decide to go through them< /Text>

Noble Plumbing, delivered as promised on a service call which I feel deserves recognition.  I looked online for the right company to remedy our situation and am glad my decision making was correct.

Thanks to John who set us an appointment answered all questions, and worked his busy service schedule to address our problem hours later. This I am sure of having called several other companies who could not fit us into their busy schedule. Also, Thanks to service technician Michael who had us up and running in short order, working with a sense of urgency while remaining safe as it was dark outside.

As a first time customer my interaction was positive, making it easy for me to refer Noble Plumbing services for any future opportunities.

It is efforts such as these that ensure customer satisfaction is met, having quality employees who champion their brand, resulting in a loyal client moving forward.

Thanks again!

<text>Amazing job installing new Water Heater:
They got a very nice quality water heater to replace the one within a small closet. The old unit was ancient, the house needed new pipes and shut off valves, (not an easy install due to the house age). The new unit is now running great, with proper pipes, valves and earthquake straps. They did it on a Saturday due to the urgency and on par with the estimate.<//text><user_id>114361946415535346933</user_id>< time>

<Text>I phoned at 9:00 AM and the guy was there in 90 minutes.  He found the problem quickly, and fixed it without a fuss for the quoted price.  I would recommend Gerardo to anyone.  Polite, professional and efficient.  You can't really ask for more.< /Text>< pics>

< review>
Noble?????? Yeah right! They should of be called "avaricious plumbing" instead these people charge oustrageous amounts for simple things such as shuting off your water or an estimate

Shutting off water $100
Estimate $200-$300

This company is a joke all the positive reviews are probably just from bots<//review>

<Review>After the first plumbing repair company struggled to both diagnose and execute the repair of a plugged drain, I contacted Noble Plumbing.  I fully expected to wait a minimum of 1-2 days to get a service person(s) to our home.  Within 3 hours of my call, a Noble technician was at our home.  Herb was courteous, professional, and most importantly, optimistic in attacking our repair needs.  He was perplexed as to why this issue was not fixed by the previous company but never took any cheap shots at his competitor, which added to the confidence and professionalism of Noble Plumbing in my mind. He very simply and quickly fixed our problem with such ease that it made it clear we had just found our new go-to plumbing company.  Thanks Herb!  Great job Noble!</Review><user_id>102275367543407539060< /user_id>< time>

We had a slab leak for a second time.  The first plumber we used is no longer in business.  John came out the same day we called and gave us an affordable estimate.  The next day John rerouted our pipes.  He did his best to figure out the best solution in my situation.  He stayed until the job was complete so we had hot water that night.</Review>

<Time>1512140634539<//Time><Text>Excellent Customer Service, the issue with our plumbing was it was incorrectly done by a previous pluming company and they just applied a bandage. Unaware the pipe bent and leaked again.  Too much money to have this happen. Noble came in an provide a quote and explained the issue and quickly fixed. I would recommend Noble Plumbing, they care about their customers and want to ensure you are fully aware of the issues and how to fix. We received calls to update me on tech status and timing. Good all around customer service and work.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Name>

<Review>Nicest upscale bar on the strip. Hands down. Beautiful pool area with great views, seating and/or cabanas depending on what time of day or year you come. Either way, it's great. If you're looking to impress on a first date, you will not fail here. If it doesn't impress, say I had a great day/evening and move on. Four different areas, all connected but with completely separate and distinct vibes. All great. Excellent cocktail, wine and bubbles selection at the bar above the pool. DJs and pool parties held here often. This is technically not a rooftop bar however it is roofless on good days and it is elevated 2-3 stories. Though only the elite stay and hang out here, everyone is welcome. Highly recommended anytime of the day, year-round.< /Review>< Time>

Cool chill place to grab a drink after work. They have happy hour from 5-8pm and its a pretty decent menu with food and cocktails. It's a dark lounge type of place so don't expect to get turnt up here. Awesome place for a date or a gno. They have free wifi and a jukebox too!</review>

I had never heard of this place but one of my employees suggested that we do our  Bryan Roberts Salon holiday party there.  The space is really cool and hip.  We had drinks downstairs before heading to our groovy semi private room.  It was a perfect room to serve up to 14 people.  We felt like we had the place all to ourselves!</Review>

I really love this place for brunch. The food is always great, and they have really good french press coffee. They also take reservations which is rare for brunch. It's rare to find it crowded though, and I REALLY hope they keep doing it. They actually dropped their prices a little to make them more in line with other brunch places. Definitely check it out!!!</review>

My wife and I have passed by this place a couple of times and have been meaning to try it out for a number of months.  We finally had the chance on a recent Friday night.  Arrived around 7:30 and it wasn't too crowded upstairs, although things were pretty lively in be bar area downstairs.  The overall ambiance was quite nice; not too loud so it was easy to have a conversation.< /review>

<text>The epitome of a trendy hipster SF bar. I didn't order any food here but had a couple cocktails. They were alright, not as much of a selection as you might expect from a speakeasy- type place. 5 stars for a total commitment to atmosphere and feel. 4.5 stars for drinks.<//text><name>Christina Reed<//name><date>1595234782367<//date><pictures>None</pictures><gmap_id>0x80c2beab2d1c5039:0x123cec145b2f7878</gmap_id>< resp>

I come here for two reasons. Alfred and Midos amazing packing and Pearls excellent service.   If she is not working. I tend to not come.  She works days and she works a full room.  Never forgets your flavour or your favourite drinks food etc. Very friendly.  The nights are fun here but service needs improvement and charcoal service is slow if Mido and Alfred are not working.  Still worth it though</Text>

I have dined here a few times, but my main attraction is their lovely lounge and bar area downstairs.  The cozy center fireplace, intimate setting, and lovely modern and sleek decor makes 25 Lusk a nice hot spot for date drinks and also intimate dinners.  Excellent service and friendly staff.< /review>

Twenty Five Lusk has one of my favorite ambiances in San Francisco. The lighting, decor, and staff are spot on. I've eaten here twice, and each time was thoroughly impressed with the speed in which the food was brought and the presentation.< /Text>

If you want to try something different, I would definitely recommend this place. It just looks like somebody spent a lot of time going for the speakeasy feel, from the exposed brick and plumbing, down to the chairs and light bulbs. The drinks menu looked interesting, but I really only tried the "Something with Vokkah" (No, I didn't misspell it, and I'm still not sure what that something really was.) Overall, nice addition to SoMa.</review>< Response>

<Text>Blown away last night by my amazing meal. Had chard octopus and tempura bacon as the starter. This dish rocked my world. I've never had bacon deep fried in tempura before. The contrast in texture with the octopus was harmony in my mouth. Mains, I shared the Quail Pancakes, Sturgeon Sneatzal and Spatzal. Savory, huge, and satisfying. Still one of my favorite restaurants in town.</Text></record>

I must admit, we weren't going with huge expectations, based on other Yelpers' reviews saying that the portions were small and the service was slow. In addition, we used a bloomspot, and after hearing horror stories of how other places treated people with bloomspots, we were apprehensive. Boy, were we wrong on all counts! 25 Lusk proved to be one of the best dining experiences we've had in ages.</text>

Very cool open bar with a unique, inviting decor.  This place was pretty packed on a Tuesday night and the bartender was busy because it was only him working there.  We had a group of four so we ordered a lot of different drinks including After the Gold Rush, Boulevard and Jungle Bird.   The consensus favorite was the gimlet though. Great spot to grab a cocktail with a small group of friends.<//Text>

<Review>My buddy and I met up after a long work week to watch the A's vs Giants game down the street and since he was Caltraining in, I searched for a nearby place we could grab a quick bite and a drink before that in order to derail us from eating ballpark food.<//Review>< resp>

A great place I'll go to often! One of my favorites in Los Angeles. Service was great from two beautiful ladies and a handsome wise gentleman bartender. I drank the Ebullition coffee stout which was a very good beer. The Burger was cooked perfectly and had wonderful toppings.<//review>

I'm in a band and this is one of my favorite places to play.  The sound is amazing, service is incredible, and the people there are so friendly.  It's the best place in Pomona if you're just stopping by for a drink, to check out a show, or to play a show, I highly recommend.< /review>

The ambiance creates a seductive and classy atmosphere, especially with the table services available alongside. If you head downstairs, it's more of where the dancing and DJ is at along with the restrooms.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

This is where the rich and classy go to drink and congratulate themselves on being rich and classy. You’ll feel like one of them if you dress the part, slowly sip your $18 handcrafted Blond Ambition cocktail, and survey the room nonchalantly to see who else is making an appearance. Even the furniture is beautiful. A couple of TVs hang near the bar for those who are bored of trying to make conversation with their arm candy and need the distraction of a football game. Validated parking is $12, so bring enough cash. But don’t rush off. Stay a while and soak it all in. This is L.A., baby.</text>

<Text>Shandy's is my absolute favorite bar. Completely unpretentious, a great mix of people and reasonably priced drinks. If you really want to experience Shandy's at it's finest be sure to go on a weekday as the weekends are always crowded.Everyone here is friendly, including the bartenders. My one and only gripe about Shandy's would be the amount of people that just HAVE to play "Bela Lugosi's Dead" by Bauhaus over and over and over. Sure, it's the only Bauhaus song you've ever heard but it's the worst song to play at a bar. So please, stay away from the Bauhaus album in the jukebox, the regulars will thank you.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< Time>

Been here Fridays for a while. Today was horrendous, service, food, atmosphere. Place was relatively empty. Game was on and it made for a horrible night. Seems like I was over charged to compensate for a slow night. Don't know if I'll be back for a while.<//Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>We were actually staying in the hotel here and stopped by both nights we were there. The patio is covered in adverse weather, but still nice and inviting, and you can smoke out there. They have a selection of cigars available to buy inside too if that's your thing.

The prices are decent for Beverley Hills, beer was under $10 dollars, and drinks were good. We were in travel clothes (nice jeans and a sweater) both nights, and we weren't looked down upon, even though I felt severely underdressed. This is great for people watching!! Occasionally you might catch a star or 2 on the weekends.

They have a great selection of food as well. Sliders, pizza, sushi, sandwiches, a little bit of everything. They're open late til around 3am too. Food under $30. Just a nice relaxed atmosphere all the way around, and super helpful non pretentious staff.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>Wonderful people at Baxter’s! Specifically Keith who went out of his way in the rain & snow,  to go outside and diagnose our engine problem. And help us get back on the road.
Thank You again Keith!

He replaced the squirrel cage on the heater unit in the RV,   and he comes to you if needed , could not give a better review if I tried .<//Text>

Quite a broad selection of items! And very competitive on their pricing.  Very helpful staff as well. Is easy to find off of the freeway, with easy access back on, with an RV section and repair man avail.< /review>

Desperately needed a starter and they were cheaper than the first place we called, the part was in stock unlike the other place, AND we called just after closing and they stayed open until we got there.  You can't get any better than that!< /Text>

Kurt M was an outstanding source of information. As a BMW owner and enthusiast, he was able to provide first hand experience about the lineup. Kurt was also wise enough to say 'I don't know, I'll find out" when something came up that wasn't on the tip of his brain. This trait is far too rare in sales as well as life in general. The ability to identify areas where additional information is needed rather than just making it up goes a long way with people like us.

Niko K, the GM, stuck with us through a challenging purchasing experience as a result of the actions of an unscrupulous dealer that set us back in a few ways. He was able to successfully navigate this challenging landscape and get us a satisfactory resolution. Overall his excellence flows down to his staff as one would expect of an exceptional leader.

This was our second M car in about a month. We'll be customers of Valencia BMW for some time to come. Thanks for a successful experience. I look forward to the next one!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp4z3iTjLBLZOC-sHISQuuOpwSPzjUoAm1DkHq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNSWXza_ZEd6ccRLRn4qcVoEp_efhFz_pAKV8-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsnaeXcypz1TXCgnV84C0t_-FjauKsmCnCeYlL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics></record>

< Review>
First time at this BMW dealership.
I can happily say I have found my new favorite local BMW dealership.
My car was towed for a blown tire and was fully replaced and resolved within a day.
Easily one of the smoothest and easiest drop-off and pick up.
Jessie was very helpful and fast at making sure my car was as it’s supposed to be.
Super friendly staff throughout!!
Highly highly recommend!!!!
Will definitely be returning here on out.
Thanks again!<//Review>

<text>I had an amazing experience at Valencia BMW. Vanessa was the best. She helped with everything down to wiping down the car. She gave great customer service throughout the whole process. She made sure I was taken care of. She spent time explaining and showing me how to use all the car’s features. She even had a bow on the car for me. Everyone there was helpful and friendly. Thank you Vanessa! Truly a seamless pleasant experience getting my new BMW.</text>< pics>

<Text>Great service. I stopped in without an appointment to fix a small problem I was having with the sunroof. They were able to take care of it right away. They noticed I was due for an oil change and was able to perform that quickly for me as well and check my tire pressure which The car was indicating was low. The only reason they’re not getting a five star from me is because I continually have been trying to reach the genius department since I was in. I have left several messages for them to reach me back and have not received a call. As far as the service department goes, I give them five stars!<//Text>< date>

I bought 2 cars from BMW Valencia and was surprised when they charged me to replace my brakes on a newly purchased “certified” car. I was deflated and felt taken advantage of! Breaks as well as other parts should be in perfect condition if the car has been certified. Not sure if I will purchase my next car from them 🤔<//review>

< review>
After telling me it would take 7-10 business days to order the new part I needed from Germany, Vanessa (my service advisor) called around and was able to find the part at a sister store and have my car fixed in less than 24 hours. I greatly appreciate the speed and extra effort they put in. They even gave me a lovely loaner vehicle for the day without hesitation. Thanks again, Vanessa!

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is for something beyond the control of the people who helped me....the fact that they choose not to regularly keep in stock what seems like a common part (replacement window motor for a 2020 BMW) was initially kind of annoying/a head scratcher.</review>

I moved from DC to California last year. After doing some research, I found that Valencia BMW was the closest dealership to me. As soon as I pulled into the service area, I was greeted by Bob. He had great energy for an early Saturday morning. As a matter of fact, all of the BMW representatives were nice and professional. I felt safe.  Everyone wore their mask. The facility was very clean. To top it all off, the service was great. My vehicle drives like new.</Review>

My experience at BMW in Valencia was amazing! Thanks to Jeffry Portillo! As soon as I walked in I was greeted professionally and introduced to him to help me find the car of my dreams. He was so knowledgeable and was able to answer ALL of my questions and most importantly, he made me feel at ease and made sure I purchased what I wanted. Never felt pressured in any way.
This is not my first car purchase, it is my third and this was by far the best experience!
Jeffry really went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help me find my dream car and meet my needs. He always responded to me right away through phone, text and email. Even the next few days after I purchased my vehicle he still keeps in touch to make sure I am happy with my new purchase.
Jeffry Portillo - Thank you so much for helping me! I am beyond happy and satisfied with my new car thanks to you!!< /text>

<review>Bob and the team at Valencia BMW provided exceptional customer service when I had my car serviced. I sat down with Bob and we reviewed my car records to determine what services were necessary to keep my car in top-running condition. Everyone wore a mask and practiced social distancing. The waiting area was immaculate and the vibe was really chill. My wait time was reasonable, and Bob ensured that my car would be ready in a few hours. My name was called to let me know my car was ready , I paid for my services then walked out to a freshly washed car! I was so excited! Many thanks to the team who serviced my car, and to Bob for working with me.

<Review>Very good service and extremely helpful however their service manager and service department could not provide the documentation needed to prove what was actually wrong with my vehicle. Had my oil changed at Valvoline they did not do it correctly so I took it to BMW which in turn did it correctly. But when I asked for documentation to provide the Valvoline they were not able to provide me with the details or the documents. All they could do was a verbal. This is just something that I figured would be a documented issue and easy to prove and provide.</Review>< Pictures>

I had a very good experience with the service department.  I was given a loaner vehicle which was the same type I drive,  and I wasn't downgraded.  The following day I picked up my vehicle, I was told there was a balance I had to pay, which was fine, however, I asked the cashier if she could give me a breakdown of the charges.  When she examined the paperwork, she noticed my vehicle is still under warranty.  She took the paperwork to the service advisor and it was confirmed that there was no cash payment due to the warranty.  I believe if I wouldn't have asked for a breakdown of my payment, the mistake would not been addressed and I would have paid the balance.< /text>

Starting with the good, The process was somewhat smooth from the test drive to the trade in vehicle witch had 2 working key fobs and was a Mercedes Benz. The contract process was also smooth now to the bad, about half way through the process we were told there was only 1 key fob
available for the car we were purchasing at which time I inquired what the price would be for a second one and was informed that it would cost approximately $500.00. Not real happy with that considering that I was purchasing a lease return vehicle makes me think that the other key is out there somewhere since the vehicle is a California vehicle not to mention what I will have to go through to get a new second key and reprogram both of them. Certainly not what I was expecting from such high quality dealer such as BMW.< /text>

Kaitlin Durand has provided the best customer service that I have not experienced with the other sales associates in the past years! I was in a situation where I needed to get out of a lease and usually the situation is a little longer and harder than just buying a car with no trade-in. I went through many dealerships and non of the sales associates have come close to the outstanding customer service that Kaitlin has provided. Whether it was responding to a call, text, securing a car for me, or the overall process, she was always on top of it. If you are looking to buy a car and want to work with an honest and not pushy sales associate, I would definitely recommend Kaitlin!</review>

Valencia BMW is VERY consumer friendly. They have implemented comprehensive COVID-19 protocols and I felt very safe during my recent visit. My liaison, Jesse Colon, is always professional, charming, and helpful. Everyone on staff is friendly. I have had great service just pulling in without an appointment and gotten air for my tires and other minor services. Five stars for Valencia BMW!<//review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>This is really the place to go if you want a BMW. I wanted a grey X1 with Oyster interior, which is evidently a little hard to find. Valencia had one, so I contacted Maryo. He immediately emailed me the specs and followed-up with pricing that was better than Edmunds lowest price.

The car was washed and ready when we showed up. We drove it, loved it (of course), and began the purchase process. Madison in finance took over.

She was extremely efficient, friendly and knowledgeable about which extra services I should get (I went with the maintenance package). We were out the door of finance and driving home in a new car in about an hour.

Valencia has a huge inventory, but they back that up with exceptional service. Super-5-star.< /text>< userid>

After working with several BMW dealerships all of California I continue to go to Valencia to the fact of my service advisor Cole. He always make sure that my car is taken care of if there’s any issues he always address them before I have to pick up my car. I will continue to go to Valencia due to his customer service skills and how he is willing to go the extra mile to ensure my happiness with Bmw. Many thanks Cole!</Review>

They need to do a better job of greeting every customer (regardless of appearance) within 1 min. of walking in the door, especially if it's not busy. The dealership is clean and organized, but customer service needs a slight boost.<//Text>

Hi. This was my 2nd time coming to this BMW. The first time was absolutely perfect and no issues. This time around, I didn’t get the customer service I received the first time. It’s a long list of things I was not happy with. I rather not list everything. Let’s just say,  I had a terrible experience. My wait on getting my car back could’ve been longer, if I wasn’t always calling to check status. It took 10 days to get my car back!!  Thank goodness at the end, the service manager took over because Vanessa was out for the day. The work done on the car was not the problem. They did great. The service manager was also great and took care of business that was dragging from the Service advisor side. I wish I would of voiced my concerns, but I really don’t like to complain. Thanks.< /Review>

I had recently stopped in to have my X5 looked at for a potential leak, Jesse took care me as always, and my car was back to me ready to go the next day, I have always appreciated Jesse input on everything, and is always helpful when it comes to both my vehicles, I trust him to give me the best advice on everything when it comes to my vehicles, go see Jesse in service. You won’t be disappointed.< /Review>

<Text>I would like to publicly thank and acknowledge David Stratton in sales for his courteous,  knowledgeable, prompt and thorough assistance with my vehicle purchase last night.  He listened attentively to my wife's and my desires and directed us to a car that I couldn't have chosen the options on better if I had ordered it from the factory myself.  He was an absolute pleasure to work with and has earned a life-long customer.

Very good service and accurate on delivery, unfortunately kind of boring understanding that the pandemic make the dealers to stop complimentary coffee, soft drinks and Saturday buffet. Also the BMW store is unattended  and nobody around to ask for clothing and other gadgets. I wanted to get some of those but no info no purchase< /Review>

<Text>We worked with a broker to lease a 330e from Valencia, the car came dirty on the inside and our sales person Wesley didn't really seem to care. Our broker was great and paid for a car detailing to fix the issues. Avoid Autonation BMW dealerships if possible.

Update:

They did pay for a detail to fix the dirty interior but it was still a bad way to start a new car experience.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Every time i go down to get a BMW I go see Wesley. My first I Went in to buy a BMW 330 from Wesley and I’ve got to hand it to him. He was amazing from the very start it seemed like he was concerned with nothing other than getting me into the car of my dreams. (We’ve bought as a family 6 cars from Wesley)  On top of finding the exact fit for me and my family He also got us an amazing deal. that was exactly in the budget I asked for. No upselling. No bait and switch. No none sense at all. Straight to the point and EXTREMELY knowledgeable about all the products. Wesley went above and beyond and exceeded all of our expectations. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY ANY BMW SEE WESELY HE IS THERE TO HELP.< /Review>

I had been searching for a pre-owned vehicle for months and couldn’t focus due to my busy work schedule. I found one off the internet and directed me to Valencia BMW dealership. I simply sent an email regarding the vehicle with what I needed. Kaitlin promptly responded to my inquiry with the vehicle detail, helped me set an appointment for a test drive, and eventually took an excellent care of me until I purchased the vehicle. It was simple, clear, and smooth as how it should be. Kaitlin isn’t a pushy sales rep like most dealerships would push you into buying and even financing with them. (I went through my own credit union for financing). Kaitlin is very friendly, direct, and flexible to work with. My purchase and experience had been a great pleasure with Kaitlin and Valencia BMW.<//text>

Easy deal. Best price and great service. They go the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable, taken care of and get your car ready and with the best possible price. No pressure and no rush. The best car buying experience you can get in 2021 even with COVID-19 protocols and standards.</text>

<Review>Jane Furmanskayja --
I can’t thank you enough for the help you provided with my recent car purchase. I have honestly bragged to a few people and those who will listen about my experience and how well I was treated by you and the team you work with there.  You made the process…seriously, unforgettable from start to finish. From previewing the car, the application process, my trade and finally finance. Together you all couldn’t have made it any easier for me and I promise I will refer you to anyone I can find interested in purchasing a new vehicle. Send my button to wear because I’m officially a Customer for Life with you and Valencia BMW.
Thank you again and I hope I’m one of many satisfied customers this month that has nominated you for sales employee of the month! You deserve it!!

All the best,

Robert Shaffer<//Review>< pics>

<rating>1</rating><text>Extremely unsatisfied with their service. My dad (Artur Antonyan) has gotten his BMW 7 series (2020) from this dealer and has regretted since. He is a very good driver and always thoroughly takes care of his cars. Recently, this car had some minor problems, so he visited them and left the car in the dealer. They have MADE UP many more issues with the car and told that he should pay additional fees for the repair. They haven't confirmed any price with us in advance, but later-on insisted on paying additional $1250, even though he pays the insurance for the repair.
I would never expect such a poor service from this kind of a car dealer. We will make sure not to extend the contract with them.

It was my first time at this dealership for service.  Jesse made everything so easy.  He explained things very clearly and never pushed a service down my throat.  He did not make me feel bad because I did not get one of the  suggested services done.  The car was returned at the promised time.   I will definitely return to this place.< /Review>

<Review>I came for a service light to be reset and was offered an oil change that will be done in an hour. Here I am waiting for two hours and they said it would be done in 20 min. They have a bunch of people just walking around and everyone went to lunch at the same time and they are now starting to come back after 40 min with food so they still have to eat. Don't get me wrong, they need their breaks but they can be staggered so that not everyone goes at the same time. Or, maybe a customer can be told when dropping off the car at 11 that the oil change will take 2.5 hours instead of 1 hour.  Just be upfront with the customer and don't promise the timeframe when you can't guarantee it.</Review>< Response>

I took the vehicle in for service and both the service advisor and shop foreman acknowledged the noise. They refused to repair the vehicle and stated that this is normal drivetrain noise and is a known issue with this series of vehicle. BMW Valencia knowingly sold me a defective vehicle and now refuses to repair it. Do not purchase a car from them.<//Review>< Pics>

I wish I can give a zero star. I went to the dealership for a repair and after it was done ROBERT ROWELAND my service advisor told me car is fixed and lights on dash are gone.

Few days later lights come on and my car spun out of control. Tried calling the service department for 2 weeks no response.

Called the corporate office they held an investigation and didn't help at all.

I took my car to another repair center and they said the same issue that I originally came in for was the same problem.

This dealership is horrible stole my money for not even repairing the car and releasing it back to the customer unsafe and unfit to drive. They are now trying to charge me more money.

Would not recommend at all

<review>We got our 3rd BMW( an X5, 540i M package and Alpina XB7) for our family from Valencia within a span of about 9 months. The excellent customer care we got from Jeffry-the sales specialist and Eddy-the finance guy
made us come back to them 2 more times and I’m sure many to come. I’m recommending Jeff to all my friends and family. Even new acquaintances. The other day I referred a lady I met in my office parking lot to Jeff.
Do your shopping around in all the nearby BMW dealerships and then make sure to go see Jeff.
I guarantee, you and your wallet will be very happy!!!</review>< Resp>

Had a great experience overall.  They had the best price in the area and the service was exceptional.  Can't say how nice a dealership this is. The sales representative and the service representatives were great.  I am glad to be living so close to such a great dealership.</review>

I was able to sit with Jesse Colon and Yliana Fetterolf and they took care of me. Hooked me up with a perfect maintenance plan which saved me 4k.

Valencia BMW is always high on the list for great experiences.  Their service department is quick and are always so helpful.  Their waiting areas are clean and neat.  They have some nice amenities for their customers like cold bottles of water, and an assortment of coffees.<//text>

<Review>This is my first time buying a car at Auto Nation. Honestly I was nervous because of the size of the company. That actually worked in my favor. They sourced the exact car I wanted at a lower price than I could find anywhere. The General Manager Niko actually got involved and helped close the deal. I can not express how professional, courteous and easy going he was. He has a great name too, just spells it wrong, LOL. I definitely never felt pressured as I have in other dealerships. They all were there for us and you could feel that. I drove from Simi Valley and I am glad I did! They just got a Loyal Client!!! Well Done!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Wesley Ramos was the best sales person I ever met. He made everything so easy for me. He went above & beyond to get me the car I wanted, even though they didn't have it in stock but he managed to get it from Las Vegas. During my one visit to the dealer, it was so clean & everybody was awesome to make you feel welcome & comfortable.
Wesley even drove to my home to have me sign the contract at my convenience & he didn't waste any of my time during the whole process...
This place gained my business for all future purchases & leases.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Avoid this scam dealership for your BMW service.The work order they generate and get you to sign is filled with false assertions(such as customer requested diagnostics which they pushed on you un-asked)They even charge you for program updates from BMW!! and although I was covered till July 2021 with their "CPO warranty" and had been scammed into signing up for a 3500$ Vehicle service contract I was charged $900+(subsequently reduced to 640$) under protest for essentially a free oil change (which I had pre-purchased with my total care vehicle service contract)and brake flush and junk fees for "diagnostics".
I have had very good experience with Center BMW in Van Nuts where I shall be servicing my vehicle in the future.</review>

<text>What great experience the wife and I had at Valencia BMW. The staff was wonderful and friendly. Our salesperson Jim was great. He was very knowledgeable and very helpful. The reason I chose this dealer is that they had a reasonable amount of car to choose from and the prices were far lower than the surrounding dealers in Los Angeles county.  If I ever have the chance to buy another BMW, Valencia BMW will be the first place I would look.</text>< pics>

He took a lot of time helping us find a car that fit our needs. They don't seem to be commission driven because we purchased a relatively inexpensive used car and received excellent service. Give that guy a raise!</Review>< pictures>

Couldn't have been any easier working with Greg Poland and Gregg Nagel on my internet purchase of a BMW Z4.  Negotiations were handled by email and a couple of phone calls in one day and I was watching the production status of my new car by week's end.  BMW offers delivery at their Performance Center in Spartanburg, SC so living in Florida and working with a dealership in Valencia, CA was not a problem.  Gregg answered all my questions during the wait as the car was built and then shipped to Spartanburg.  The delivery experience at the BMW Performance Center was fantastic!  It's a great way to get your car and I recommend Valencia BMW and the Performance Delivery experience to anyone looking to buy a new BMW.</Text>

<Text>Love the car I got, and the service I *finally* did get from John, which was excellent. Everything else though wasn’t ideal. We initially waited for about 20 min before being helped. After each car buying step there was a big wait, overall start to finish - 5-6 hours. We didn’t really get time estimates for anything so it was hard to plan (e.g. We had to wait an hour before we could talk to the finance manager). And then when we finally got to our car, it hadn’t been cleaned up/washed, and there wasn’t even a full tank yet (which made me wonder, why hadn’t the car been absolutely ready to go in that 5-6 hour span?). This was another 30 minutes after a pretty long process. We also would have been charged a higher interest rate had we not done our homework online before. Thankfully I knew what BMW financial was offering for pre-owner certified.

When we did have service it was good (again, John is the best), and the people were kind, but the overall experience could have been better.<//Text>< Time>

I purchased a car with them. I needed to get ahold of them about my GAP insurance and immediately got rude customer service and transfered the call and got hung up on. I called again and he argued with me because I'm calling the wrong area when all I asked was for the correct number to call and they hung up again. Do not waste your time here cause they clearly aren't here to help. I bought a car from them but not again.
TL;DR: RUDE/UNRESPONSIVE< /Review>

Joe and AutoNation did a great job helping us to finalize a deal on a beautiful 2021 BMW 330i. We didn’t wanna stay at the dealership for long time due to my wife’s being pregnant and the whole did process was only 30min. They told us fo signing you have to wait a longer time so asked us to come back next day so they have the paperwork ready and that’s exactly what happened. There were little bit of a hiccup with finance manager which Joe tried to overcome that immediately. Great job Joe< /text>

I've had the BEST adventure in ALL of my dealings at Valencia BMW. I take my hat off to my Sales Rep Maryo Metry who saw me through from beginning to end! He is the master of his sales craft! Thank you, thank you, thank you for all that you've done to get my deal worked out! He was fully prepared, engaged and communicated effectively throughout the entire process. Never has a car buying deal felt this easy. He got everything done including my appraisal for my trade-in entirely through e-mail. When I went to the dealership my car was ready and the paperwork signing was done expeditiously! Madison was meticulous, prompt and attentive to every detail. Shout out to the General Manager Nico for reaching out to me and another Manager Sean who worked my deal behind the scenes. I am loving my 330I and if you are deciding on a dealership to make a purchase you must go here immediately!<//review>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>I mean, what can I say about the car buying experience.  It's brutal, and no dealership makes it very pleasant.  It could be so fun and exciting, especially for a person like me who not only love cars, but who also used to be in the business.  The reality is, it's all about holding gross in a dealerships eyes.  Valencia BMW made it as pleasant as possible, and I would most likely buy from them again.  I would even recommend them to friends/family.  But don't expect their so-called "genius" to help much with the explanation and delivery of your new car.  I bought a 2021 540i M-Sport and I love it, but I am still trying to figure it out.  I actually set out to buy a used CPO 540i M-Sport, but hands down, this was the right move!</review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1608751987168, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

I had a 2017 Volt with high miles. For a few thousand more I got this 2017 i3 with only 24K miles on it. I have never owned a BMW, so I am looking forward to the experience. Plus, just passing by the gas station forever. :-) David Stratton was tops. Totally professional and focused on what I was looking for. I would very much recommend this dealer, and this car.<//Text>

I bought a pre-owned BMX X3 from another Autonation branch and it started to show "Charge warning light" two weeks later having difficulty to start. I took it to Autonation BMW Valencia and service advisor explained the 90 day warranty coverage and gave me a loaner as well. They replaced Battery and registered it as well rechecking the entire car at no cost to me. I am very please with my buying experience from Autonation and service from network of dealerships. This is the difference of buying from a réputable dealership vs small indépendent used car place.<//Text>

BEYOND DISAPPOINTED with BMW of VALENCIA, the SERVICE DEPT, and specifically HENRY, the SERVICE MANAGER.

We live close to another BMW dealership, but decided to make the (20 mile) drive to take our i3 in for service at Valencia because we felt its a better dealership, but it didn't work out as planned. Besides getting there before they even opened for a better chance at a loaner (didn't get one), and them telling us that "this/that isn't covered" even though car is certified, and purchased from Valencia BMW under a year ago, we finally went to pick up the car.. to find out that it was scratched. They then tried to tell us "well we covered the issues for you" (fuel pressure sensor, and a door handle making noise) like thats an excuse for scratching an otherwise pristine car.

This is where it gets good: HENRY tells us to not worry about it and that someone will come by our house TOMORROW to fix it for us. Tomorrow comes and goes. A week passes by.. nothing. We call Henry, he doesn't respond. Ask the receptionist to get a hold of him, still nothing. Left him multiple voice mails, and he never got back to any of them. NOT A SINGLE CALL or CONTACT FROM Dealership or HENRY. This is BEYOND APPALLING. It would have been preferred if they just insulted us straight to our face, than to tell us that "someone will come by the house tomorrow to fix the scratch" and then proceed to ignore us completely.

We will NEVER go there again. Stay away and BEWARE!

I've attached a picture of the scratch I took in front of Henry at the d. The dealership. The pain is still hanging off.<//Text>

This is the absolute best place in the Los Angeles area to buy or lease a BMW. They recently helped me do a buy-out of my lease, and charged no markup whatsoever! The process was seamless and straightforward.</review>

<Text>Ok so I have a unique story/situation with my review.   Gotta have the right sales associate.  Lots of prudes and play the game people there.  I know I talked to 5 of em prior to finding the right peeps.  However, when you get the right associate... They go BEYOND what is needed.  I will say NOT all associates are prudes, I just happened to catch the douches.  They do have great people working there, willing to chat, willing to help, willing to do what they can to earn your business.   Both my sales associate and finance person were incredible.  There was no twisting of my arm, no twisting of theirs, very straight forward, they got the price I wanted, so I bought extra packages from them.  Beautifully done.  Exactly what I was hoping for.    Great trade in price, final MSRP was spot on.  Things were just SMOOTH.</Text><name>J C< /name><resp>{'time': 1605582931108, 'text': 'We are pleased to hear you had such a positive experience with us!

This is the first time to write a review about anything.
But to be transparent and provide a real feedback Hambik the service manager at Valencia dealer is a very good person, I give him 5 Stars for his service and tried to help with my claim regarding my X2 rear break Pads and disk, as sensor didn’t work and with a low mileage 27k I have to change the pads and disk.
I had already changed front pads at 19k since it gave me notification earlier!!!!

Unfortunately BMW didn’t agree to change or offer any compensation I opened a ticket with their help desk as I’m sure it is a manufacturer or low quality parts, they only argued that it is wear and tear and nothing related to their quality!!!! As if it is my first time to drive a car Lol!!!  But Hambik tried his best and provided the best discount he can offer in spares and labor.

I’m very satisfied with his professional service and attitude but unfortunately not satisfied with my X2 and will never recommend it for anyone.

Thanks< /text>

<Text>I worked with Mazen on purchasing a pre-owned vehicle.  Very professional, and down to earth.  He didn't push to sell, but rather allowed me to assess the car, and make decision.  The whole transaction went smooth, no hidden fees like some third party dealers add to make up for their low advertised price, but just straight up advertised price + sales tax + documentation fee.  Also they have 5 day return period for their used cars, and 90 days dealer warranty.  Something to note is that Mazen followed through his promise to take care of some maintenance issues, and extra detailing after the purchase of my car.  Very happy with Mazen and his team, highly recommended.<//Text>< GmapID>

Brought my 2006 330i Sedan in for recall service on 18Feb21 at Valencia BMW.  The recall was for PCV Valve Heater, Blower Motor Wiring, and Driver's Air Bag Module.  As of Sunday, 21Feb21, on initial start-up of my car it revs over 1000 rpm for 3-4 secs. the lower portion of my dash now creaks (squeaks), and my service engine soon light is on.  Between Nov. & Dec. 2020 I spent a little over $3K with my mechanic who has been servicing all 4 of my previous BMW's and my car was fine. I have had work performed on my vehicle in the past at this dealership with no problems! Don't know what happened here?  At this time I can't give any stars or recommendations. (Won't let me post unless I give a star.)
Sorry, Valencia BMW<//Review>

Always a pleasure to visit one of the best BMW centers in the world all thanks to service consultant Jessie! Anytime I have a issue with my vehicle I always bring it straight to him. He handles everything with good care and makes sure all your problems and needs is taken care of! 10/10 would recommend him to anyone who drives a BMW, even if you have to drive across Los angeles. Again, thank you Jessie for all that you have done!<//Text>

Worst dealership to walk into! We were at the showroom and on the lot for an hour and not a single person approached us. Take your business elsewhere and don’t waste your time.

I had a great buying experience at Valencia BMW.  They were flexible and accommodating.  Maryo Metro was awesome to work with and he took the time to get the best deal for me and to make sure that the vehicle was perfect before I drove it off the lot.  My experiencing working with Maryo and with the finance manager, was wonderful. I will be buying from them again in the future.  Thank you Maryo and Valencia BMW!</Text>

Valencia BMW is extremely nice. When the mini dealership closed I was so sad, but BMW is absolutely amazing, its worth the money. The service team is so friendly, and they actually care about my car even though it not an actual BMW. I highly recommend Christopher, he really goes above and beyond.<//Text>

<Text>Would have been 5 stars if I had gotten my car back fine.  After leaving the dealership Vanessa who had helped me was great!  I had paid Almost $900 for everything.  I was ok with that since the car needed normal maintenance.

The following day I paid everything, and was told that was it!  I was good to go!  Once I got my car back, I noticed a noise that was never there before.  My car had 66K miles and never had an issue.  Also for 6 years and 66K miles later, I had taken my car to BMW of Sherman Oaks.  No issues.  Now I have an issue after coming here for the first time ever.  And no one told me I had an issue until hours later Vanessa left a voice mail saying she forgot to tell me the mechanic found a problem with the E-Brake Clip and it would now cost $1,000 dollars to fix but I would get 10% off so $900.  After just coughing up $850+ I wasn't in the best mood.

I spoke with Henry the Director outside and explained to him that I truly feel Im being robbed right now.   Henry said the issue was very common between 40K and 60K on their cars.  I told him it doesn't mean it has to happen to mine because my car was fine when I dropped it off and NOW "SUDDENLY" I have this problem when I didn't have that issue before when I dropped it off.  Also BMW of Sherman Oaks never said anything or to be aware of it when I had taken it there last time.  I felt the mechanic knew this was a common issue and knowing that I just dropped over $850+ then I can Offord another $1000.  Its possible the mechanic did this on purpose?  I dont know.  I told him I know how mechanics work and get paid as I have family in the business and they have informed me of the scams and things they would do to customers so they could get paid more.  Henry understood my concern and was helpful and kind enough to reduce it to half as he said he would pay the other half.  All in all I paid roughly $1,250 and still wasnt happy.  I was told my car would be ready the following day as the process would only take 3 to 4 hours fixing a part that costs $20.00.  I got my car back 2 days later!! No calls to tell me what was going on or that they were working on the car still.   No apologies for the delay in getting my car back..

Overall not quite the experience I was hoping to have from BMW considering that the cars and parts are already expensive as we are driving great cars.  Not Hondas.    Wont be taking my car back there for service anymore.</Text>< Rate>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This was my first purchase at Valencia BMW and my experience was fantastic!! I first contacted them through Internet Sales and within ten minutes I received a call from Internet Sales Manager, Wesley Ramos. He then handled most of the sale by phone and email, from picking out the vehicle from their inventory online, my credit application and even my trade-in. When I arrived at the dealership Wesley was waiting for me and all I had to do was check out the vehicle, take it for a test drive and then right into finance wherein everything was all ready for me. From the time I arrived until I left with my new BMW it was just a little over one hour. Because of Wesley this had to be one of the best experiences I have had purchasing a new vehicle. It was also evident to me that Wesley cares very much about his clients and wants the best for them and clearly wants to build a long business relationship. Even after I purchased my new BMW and needed assistance, Wesley called me right  back and was again waiting for me at the dealership. I will defiantly purchase another vehicle from Wesley and will refer friends and family to him as well. I also want to give a shout out to Gary Kazandjian in Finance for a great job and no sales pressure, as well as Cole Schwartz in service for assisting with an update on the vehicles computer and answering all my questions. After my experience, Valencia BMW and Wesley have a customer for a very long time.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Found a truck with all the options I had been looking for. Scheduled an appointment with them to buy it. I purchased airfare and hotel based on that. They sold it and never contacted me. So I got stuck with over $600 in non refundable airfare and hotel. Luckily I contacted them about why they hadn't emailed me the pricing sheet before leaving on the airplane. If I hadn't it would have cost me another $300-400 to get home.
So, to anyone buying from them over the internet, you better get the deal done in registered mail before making flight arrangements. I was not offered any kind of refund for any of the travel expenses.

Edit: Hotel ended up giving me a refund so was only out $350 in airfare. Also I have to say they did try hard to find something equivalent and even offered to pay for the trucking of one in that had similar options. So I am revising to 3 stars as after they looked into it, was the fault of one person, not the dealership.<//review>< pics>

Valencia BMW and Robert Perez went out of their way to help us when our 328d had a major issue while we were traveling south on I 5.  They attempted to address the issue quickly so we could continue our trip, but when it became clear they needed more time they provided a loaner and made arrangements for us to pick our car up 4 days later on our way north.
The car was fixed, clean and ready to go as promised.
Everyone involved was courteous and followed through.  All things considered, it was a very good experience..<//review>

We took our Z4 to get a diagnostic check due to the check engine light. Unfortunately, nothing was found, and we paid the fee. They said if it comes on again bring it back for no charge. The light came on and we brought back. They found the issue and fixed it at no charge. It’s rare that a company keeps it's word. I'm grateful to BMW of Valencia for keeping their word. Good job.<//text>

UPDATE: I was not able to speak to the general manager as the comment says and Gary Kazandjian talked to me and he is SUPER RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. Seriously, this location is a terrible image of BMW brand!

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I have had a leased car for 3 years and they never answer the phone. Called the past 2 days more than 5 times and left more than 4 messages for the finance department and one of them was with a sales manager complaining about the poor customer service who confirmed someone will call me in the same day, but no one cares!

Better stay away from this dealership because they don't care about their customers once they sell you a car!!<//Review>

This was my first service at BMW of Valencia. Jesse was amazing and personable. He knew exactly how long the service was going to take and what was wrong. When it comes to service, you have to trust the advisor to do the right thing and consistency is always key. Each time I go in for my service or issues ..... I know who I am calling to be my trusted advisor. Thanks for showing my 4 Series love.< /review>

It started off okay when I looked into getting a used car here. After the main contact person, Wesley got too busy to respond to my emails,  I went into the actual store and met with his counter part Sergik. He was way better with emails and contact info. Insisted that the car have a full bmw prep and did a full inspection. A few days before the busy Christmas and new years season, I arranged for the car to be picked up by me. I was coming from 60 miles away so I needed the car to have no issues. Picking it up was easy enough. On my drive home, I realized the cars steering wheel would need to be turned to the left to keep the car straight.  I figured they would fix any alignment issues when they said they would give me new tires and when they did that bmw inspection.  I, also, noticed during that drive home, the car would shake at a stop a little than I expected and heard a small crackling noise from the front driver side. It still drove okay so I figured I'd just check it out after the holiday season since I was so busy.

The first business day after the new years,  I took the car straight to a alignment and mechanic shop and the first thing they tell me that the car had some major suspension issues. Issues I was NOT told about prior and I felt the BMW techs should have caught it before giving me the car. They said it had a lower control arm bushing that were broken on both sides and that my front struts were leaking badly. Unsafe to drive and would cost me over $2,000 to fix for all 4 wheels. I was not happy to hear this and emailed Sergik about it the same day. He only forwarded my response to his conditioning team but never did more. Almost like he didn't care to follow up or say sorry they missed such a huge issue. Only wanted to make the sale. I'm still waiting for a reply from the conditioning team at this BMW but I'm not hopeful they would step up anyways since it's been over a week since I picked up the car. Beware buyers. I had so many bmws in the past but never ran into this issue from a dealer. Sad.<//text>

Sales and finance staff were very professional and pleasant.  I spoke to Sergik and discussed the i3 before I went to the dealership.  We agreed on a price and he did not try to add on any extras and do the "bait and switch" that other car sales people tried on me before I got to Auto Nation.  Yliana the finance person made the transaction quick and painless.  I will definitely go back to Valencia BMW.  I LOVE my i3!< /Review>

The absolute best experience you can have buying or leasing a car. Kia and Jeffrey are fantastic and make the experience so easy and fun. We have leased our last 4 BMW’s from Kia and Jeffrey because of this wonderful experience and everyone we have referred has agreed that they are the absolute best!</text>

<review>There are many instances where we utilize a dealership.  One where we buy and one where we service. I'm going to mention the service aspect. When you buy a car, the lasting relationship is with your service advisor. I've had my car since I picked it up in Germany. Since, I've had it serviced in Germany, San Antonio, Concord, CA and another SoCal dealer once or twice. But, by and large, Chris Rawlins and the service team have been spectacular throughout the years! Always fair, always professional and super knowledgeable. I know BMW maintenance is pricy but, the cars are engineering masterpieces so the cost of upkeep is higher than typical econo cars. That in mind, I'm also a perfectionist so I demand my car be in top shape.  The service team has exceeded my expectations and I intend to continue my relationship with BMW and the outstanding team at Valencia BMW. If only the sales team was as interested in keeping my business! But that's another review!<//review></record>

I have not always been an avid fan of dealer service departments, but the Service staff at Valencia BMW, especially advisor Cole Schwartz, keeps me coming back. Appointments easy to make, rarely a wait more than 5 minutes from appt time, work done well, easy loaner process, and great communication re issues and resolution.

<user_id>106382913198260950737<//user_id><Text>I called the service dept, and spoke to Vanessa over the phone. I informed her of the issue I was having with my vehicle. She informed that this is an issue that they tend to see quite a lot and that it would be covered under warranty. I gave her the last 7 of my VIN and she informed me that my vehicle just went out of warranty (less than 6 months ago). She than mentioned that they would still be able to take care of it due to the recent warranty expiration and the low miles of the vehicle (23k). She said I would just need to bring my car in to confirm the low miles and that the issue is as described. Fast forward 2 hours later I drive my car in to the service dept and patiently wait for Vanessa. I speak to her and she confirms that my issue would be covered even out of warranty, and says that I would need to bring my car in on Thursday, so she can get me a loaner. That is fine with me. Than she returns with her manager Dave, who informs me that since my car is out of warranty ( less than 6 months) that they would not honor my repair. I mention to him what Vanessa said about brining the car in on Thursday. He is not having it. He mentions that if I take the car to the dealership it was purchased at they might have more of an incentive to repair the defect. That was puzzling to me because what is the difference between Valencia BMW and the dealership it was purchased at? Why did Vanessa state they would be able to get it covered, and start the schedule the repair for Thursday and not follow through on that promise?  I would recommend staying away from this service dept, as they make false promises, and lead you to believe one thing, and than flip the script for you.< /Text><Name>Jazib Qureshi</Name>< Response>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I really like this dealership. I have the pleasure to work with Lillian who is awesome, and this is my 4th car that I’ve gotten from her, and 6 cars total from this dealership. They are extremely nice and accommodating—Lillian dropped my car off once at home, and another time at Disneyland because we had a family day planned. They have competitive pricing to top it off. I ordered my M2 through her, every thing was done via email and was delivered to my workplace the same day it arrived at the dealership. Purchasing and leasing cars from her was pleasant and stress free. I can’t recommend this dealership enough.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMevg__6b4jigqzz-0ebz__Klj1fvqUNZGO7e6N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7Rk-qESEbnM72mSyQ8ips-D9LiB6Y9WJTDxeg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3NZXe0MeKCyoLxgrV0BBhPh3UE24mxV7x90lZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPittZDA4R8Nm2BUTF7P3GyijgbyRHpIQ69CMas=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881< /GmapID></record>

<text>Today December 13, 2020 we called BMW of Valencia and spoke with sales rep. name John,   we were very interested in this car 2018 BMW M4 and John promised us that he will provide additional details to our cell phone via text message.   We waited for couple hours, never heard back from John.   We decided to drive to the dealership all the way from Thousand Oaks.   Up on arrival at the dealer lot couple sales reps greeted us and since we want to follow the ethical protocol, we ask for John.  In about a minute or two Johan showed up and I introduced myself again and reminded him about the BMW M4 that we are ready to purchase on the phone.    John informed us that the vehicle was just sold.   I told him that why did you not contact us and especially we drove over 58 miles to come and purchase this vehicle.  Also told him that we got pre qualified for x amount of loan on auto nation website.    John said sorry I forgot to text you the details and walked away.     We drove all the way to this dealership for being high rated on customer service, but I am sorry to say it failed us.  AJ<//text></record>

5 stars for BMW Valencia for an outstanding car leasing experience! Lynn Ruehman at the dealership was so helpful and wonderful to work with, and I got the vehicle I wanted (ordered from the factory with specific options) at a great price. Communication was by phone and email, and the vehicle was at the dealership in less than 2 months! Fast! Lynn arranged for the vehicle to be delivered to me, as I live about 30 miles from the dealership. Luis from the dealership delivered the vehicle to me, with a full tank of gas, and I signed the docs at delivery. This was a stress free leasing experience and I love my new BMW! If you’re in the market for a BMW, I highly recommend giving Lynn a call!<//text>

<review>When getting service done at Valencia BMW ask for Jesse Colon as your service manager!  He really is the only one there that cares about your wallet or your vehicle.  I have found him to be very helpful over the years.

The service manager, Henry, is useless.  After multiple attempts to speak with him regarding my warranty, not a single call back.  He might want to find a new line of work.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1593553034787, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

Jesse Colon is the best service rep they have! He’s always polite and professional and gets what I needed done without trying to up sale me. I will continue to go to Valencia BMW and work specifically with Jesse for the future to come.< /Review>

Slightly disappointed. Later in the day after my service, I noticed the service light on when starting the car. I had to go back to the dealership to have it reset for service that was preformed the day prior. It’s a little thing having to go back, but for being BMW and the price for service, I expect it complete the first time. My time is valuable too.<//Text>

<Review>Took my car for a service, picked up the car and got busy with a service advisor talking didn’t check the car right away, went home to my garage and notice a scratch, called them right away and manager said they will take care of it, they told me they going to check all the cameras and will call me back in 24-48 hours.  Never got a call from them and when I called them 4 days later they are saying they saw nothing on camera, I guess scratch came on it’s own they scratch cars and don’t take any responsibility my car is still has scratch please check your cars when you pick them up because dealer will scratch it and won’t fix it don’t even deal with Valencia BMW<//Review><user_name>Anatoliy Balagula<//user_name><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIqULBB0Nyv7Nydu56YqIO80GFrnbB03Kyz_q8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><GmapID>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881<//GmapID>< resp>

Got my first BMW here and the experience was AMAZING! Jim was an awesome consultant in helping me pick the best car for us and answering all our questions. They made financing really easy here!  Did not feel pressured at all and very happy with my purchase :)<//text>

<text>if you truly want an advisor who care's and understands your concern go see Robert, he will go above and beyond for you and make sure you get the top notch service you should as a BMW customer.  My only complaint is that my rotors are warped (unsafe and having warranty) BMW will not change out pads and rotors due to them not being under 3MM.  seems like BMW does not care for your safety but cares more for the money you can pay.

My service advisor, Jesus Colon was very pleasant to work with. Very knowledgeable and he has a good upbeat personality.
He goes by Jesse and the new service area looks awesome.
I have been a customer at Valencia BMW for over 15 years and never had any issues. Always great to visit.< /review>

I purchased a used 2016 i3 for $16K. It was a great deal and Tony was great! He took all my calls and answered all my questions. He was very patient with me through the process. I appreciate the time Tony took to explain the features of my i3. He even gave me tips about driving an i3 and told me places I could go to charge.
The process to purchasing my i3 did not go so smooth. My concern was with Gray, in finance. I did not wish to purchase an extended warranty. The warranty choices were between $10K and $13K. The  purchasing of an extended warranty was not a wise use of money. Gary tried a scare tactic in his second attempt at pushing me into the sale. To perform updates on the i3, Gary said it had to be placed on a Dyno machine. I could tell he was upset as his demeanor and behavior changed when I declined the second time. I understand pushing for a sale, but using scare tactics and bringing emotions into a deal are unprofessional.</Text>

<text>I always bring my 2 vehicles (X5 & 430i) here for service and the staff is always friendly, attentive and knowledgeable with the vehicles. On my last visit there was a little misunderstand with the service being done, but Sara at the front desk and the manager Darin resolved the issue quickly and professionally even though part of the blame/misunderstanding was my fault.

Initially contacted Valencia BMW through True Car.  The salesperson was professional and courteous.  We negotiated over the phone and I brought my own financing, however Valencia BMW were able to beat my credit unions interest rate, so I went with BMW Finance.   When I arrived at the dealer, I was treated well.  The salesperson and finance manager were professional and accommodated my concerns and answered all my questions.  The reason Valencia BMW is getting three stars rather than five is due to problems with the certified 2017 BMW 750i I purchased, with only 20k miles.   Once the transaction was completed and I drove off the lot, the "Active Driving Assistant" error lights/alerts went off on my screen.  I drove the car back immediately and the salesperson told me service was closed (it was Sunday) and to take the vehicle to my local BMW dealer for service.   I took my 2017 BMW 750i to my local BMW dealer two days later.   Later that afternoon I received a call letting me know there are issues with the "Active Driving Assistant" which they will fix, however they discovered several leaks, including a leak in the transmission.   The latest information was quite disturbing, considering I purchased a "Certified BMW".   I thought the whole idea of purchasing a "Certified BMW" is that they went through a detailed and comprehensive ordeal to certify the car.    How could they miss the issues with the "Active Driving Assistance" and especially leaks, which my local BMW dealer discovered immediately??   The three star review is very gracious, considering many people are less tolerant and would have given them a one star review.   My "Certified BMW" is still in service (three days later) waiting for repairs to be completed.  Not at all what I expected!  I didn't buy the car from any small used car lot.  I have higher expectations from an official BMW dealer.< /Review>

<Text>I stopped using dealership mechanics years ago because of the overly priced services. I thought I would give BMW a try since they should treat their customers better than just any dealership. Nope, overly priced as the rest. Took my car in last week, waited 20-30 minutes after I checked in for the appointment I arrived on time for. Result was a price for repairs at just under $2,000. I went to get a second opinion and took the car to a BMW mechanic and he did the same work for $700 plus tax. Unless we stop taking the cars to the dealership, they won't change. I wouldn't mind paying alittle more for good service. But when the service is mediocre and the price is more than double, that's not orth it or acceptable.</Text><Rating>3<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

Jeffry Portillo has made my first BMW 3 series lease experience effortless. After a few email exchanges I made an appointment to visit BMW of Valencia, Jeffry had the car waiting for me in the front. Went test drove the car, reviewed the lease terms, and afterwards I signed the lease agreement and did the paperwork. At all times was Jeffry honest and upfront about everything and made sure I was taken care of. From the moment I arrived to the dealership, to after test driving, doing the paperwork and driving off, everything took barely over 2 hours and overall a very pleasant experience.
Looking forwards to my next lease with Jeffry and Valencia BMW</Text>

Ok, I had an appointment on Saturday June 6 and drove all the way from Oceanside to purchase a vehicle. I had been communicating with Jonathan Fierro the previous 4-5 days about this particular vehicle.I arrived to the dealership with my down payment prepared to purchase said vehicle.I was then told that there was a problem and that another customer had reserved it a day or two ago and that basically that they had to hold it for the other customer to purchase and that there was nothing else they could do. They offered to pay for my gas for the trouble and obviously all I could see was Red!!! They also said that if the other customer doesn't show up to buy it,they would drive it all the to Oceanside, where I live...So,as I write this Saturday evening, June 6,I haven't heard anything,so I assumed that it was sold.If I could give them a NO Star rating I would Yes,I'm a Disgruntled customer,but that's how I feel...ZERO RECOMMENDATION 😠😠😠< /Review>

<review>Robert Perez, our service specialist, was outstanding! We found ourselves in a difficult situation when arrived. After traveling for over an hour to the dealership Robert personally took matters into account and without any hesitation made things happen. Robert is the first person I have dealt with for service at this dealership and if all the workers are as hard working as dedicated as he is then it is a testament to the work ethic they show! It was a great experience and look forward to their business again!!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I am sad that the mini dealer closed and I had to go to BMW. My first time coming and one your male salesperson was not wearing a mask. Came in said hello to the cashiers. He was tall and a lot hair product. Sat let side of the large TV, and each time I saw him his mask was not fully on when he did have one. Never coming back.< /Review>

How can this dealership warrant so many positive reviews? I have been trying to get a response from Polo Lopez GSM for over a week and from his BMW Genius Jonathan. GM called me and resolved the issue. Many thanks to him.<//Review>

I cannot tell you how incredible the service is at this facility. My service representative is Vanessa. I am a nurse, and during this crazy crisis I had to cancel my appointment three times for an oil change and service on my car. I called at the last minute For an appointment and Vanessa said “come right in and I will give you a loaner right away we know you need to get to work”. Her care and attention were so amazing, and I felt myself releasing all of my stress and stories on her for a minute, lol. She has the best attitude, great listener and truly cares about her clients!! I will be a Valencia BMW client for life. Thank you to all the awesome team members at this facility!!!!</Review>

I don't usually write reviews, but a car is a big purchase. This was the best and easiest car-buying experience I've ever had in my life. Great prices and fair trade-in values. When I need my next BMW, however many years from now, I will definitely come back here.<//Review>

Scheduled a service appointment last week for service today and requesting a loaner car at the time of sceduling. I got a confirmation email for the appointment, even got a 2nd confirmation yesterday for the appointment. Went there this morning and was told:" Sorry we have no loaner car for you."
I told them I had an appointment and had to leave , so I had to reschedule my appointment.
Had been a long time customer of Valencia BMW, customer service used to be very good, but last couple of years it's been going down!!</Text>

I had a wonderful experience at Valencia BMW. I was looking for a used vehicle and Maryo Metry was an amazing help. He answered all my questions quickly.
I drove 1.5 hours from Bakersfield to this dealer and on the day of my test drive Maryo had the vehicle washed and gassed up and ready for a spin. The test drive went well and Maryo was fun to talk to. While waiting for the Finance Manger I was offered drinks and snacks. Maryo found that there might be an issue with the battery in the vehicle and had it sent to the service department for inspection. Upon inspection, they replaced the battery at no cost.
I met with the Finance Manager, Hamid and he was wonderful to work with. He was kind, funny, and listened to what I did and did not want. We worked together and decided on a term that I was comfortable with. Not once did he try to up sell me or convince me of something I did not need.
This was a WONDERFUL car buying experience! I will continue to go to Valencia BMW for all my car buying and maintenance needs as well as refer people. GREAT GREAT GREAT experience! I couldn't be happier.<//Text>

I took my car in for a service recall on an engine part.  This place has outstanding service.  Quite honestly, I have never encountered a more polite dealer anywhere at any time. They took my car within 10 minutes of my appointment and finished within five minutes of the estimated time. I understand the waiting area is new and it is comfortable, coffee, water bottles, and donuts.  I know someone there mentioned to the crew of this place "attention to detail" and it shows.</Text>

As an auto broker I do a lot of business with Valencia BMW and I always receive terrific service whether it is my customer's car or my own car.  I dropped off my Valencia BMW lease return and leased a new BMW last week and I could not be happier with the service I received.< /text>

We leased a car in 2017 and want to buy it. Deal was done and loan application was filed on line. Appointment was made, waited for  2.5 hours just to sign the contract, very disappointed. Service was decent when leased it in 2017, but today it was horrible.<//text>

Took my car in for faulty alarm sensor of my X5. My alarm would go off randomly. Jesse Colon was my service manager and he was great. Easy to deal with. He was pleasant and knowledgeable. My problem was identified and fix. Good experience!<//Review>

<Review>My car starting throwing all kinds of errors and malfunction messages. Since it’s an electric car having multiple malfunction errors pretty much means the car is inoperable. Had it towed into the dealership the next day. They had it diagnosed and fixed before noon. Was just a dead battery. Easy breezy. They had it ready and even cleaned when I got there. Couldn’t have been easier.</Review><user_id>102209062918852208048<//user_id>< Rating>

I brought my wife's vehicle to this location for service.  While most of it was routine service, the front end was making scraping noises.  I believed it to be brakes, which for a 2 year old vehicle with only 16K miles on it seemed out of the normal life of brakes.
The service advisor [Jesse, he was great, a total 10 in our book] called and advised we needed a complete front end brake job, pads, rotors, sensors, and whatever else they do for $1100.  WOW, not his fault the price is what it is, but, for a "brand" that is supposedly high end, this is low end equipment if it only lasts 16k miles.
I called twice to the service manager "Henry", who never called me back, he had "Darin" call my wife.  Wow, there is great customer service, can't return a phone call.  We finally were able to connect with "Darin", after I picked up the vehicle.  He said it's driving patterns and some other lame excuses for why a car of this price and calibre, would need an $1100 brake job.  Plus, of the 16K miles, we only put on 13500, because it was a former loaner vehicle that was taken out of service at 2500 miles.  While I know maybe some of the courtesy loaner drivers may ride the brakes, my wife does not.
So, we were offered the opportunity to purchase the next step warranty for $800, yes a $300 savings, oh, and if the back brakes go out, which they said probably weren't far behind, would be covered.
So my wifes experience with her desire to have a BMW diminished and the obvious quality not there, her next vehicle, [next year] won't be a BMW.
We would not recommend this dealership on their customer service, [other than Jesse], to anyone, and certainly DON"T BUY BMW's.
I think that stands for "buy more warranty's"!< /Review>

<Date>1597335906696</Date><Text>Just bought my BMW after looking at other dealership call and spoke to Mrs .Jane K  who was very professional from makeing the phone call to when I went to the dealership and test drove the car . Was very nice she  answer my question and concearn about the car .very knowledgeable and kind to my little daughter made the whole purchase go smooth. Now things started to shift down when she took me to the finance department to a Melinda let me just say she was very unprofessional .like she had a bad day or this is how she is becuase,I could say that she made me feel uncomfortable made me feel like she didn’t want to help me out . I bought several cars and I know what a finance officer supposed to do is explain to u before signing like if I had to literally tell her what Im I signing. I bought the car cash and she felt very bother by counting the money she also had someone help her count it . The way she was counting the money was a bother to her . Now after the money was counted the man stepped out she continued to type in her computer and she yelled from the office to 3 team members to bring her tape for the cash envelopes finally someone brings her some then tells him to help her tape it up becuase the man who helped her didn’t finish doing his job here and just left she sounded very fustrated .. now she told me if I could pay the exact change becuase she didn’t have change to give me . forgot to mention I had to go to a atm to withdraw money becuase my card didn’t have my name on it as it was a temporary card holder while waiting to be  sent from the bank . So I had withdraw a little under 1,200 car was almost 25,000 as I came bck she tells me can we run ur card to withdraw $17.00 cause we dnt have change  and I said “ you said you couldn’t withdraw from this card becuase my name wasn’t on it but now you want to withdraw from my card becuase you dnt have change it’s not my fault you dnt have change .. I had to go to a chase atm to withdraw money just for you to tell me if you can run the card.when  you said you couldn’t use due to protocols. I’m sorry but that’s not my fault they finally got my change the man came in and said we are all done here. I Grab my paperwork that was not but in a folder at least put a paper clip on it .I quess my business didn’t deserve a folder but never would I do business with this dealership is sad that you have such a great sale person Mrs.Jane k just to have someone else ruin it becuase there day went wrong< /Text>< UserId.>

<text>just a normal maintenance checkup and look at inflation on a tire. Tire had a nail so that was taken care of at a tire shop. Christopher was efficient as always.
But for some reason, it takes forever to get my car through the wash. I think it took an hour again. I asked twice and the customer representative had to come check my receipt and call before it was ready.< /text></record>

<text>Wonderful experience!  I drove from my city that has a BMW dealership to this one in Valencia because of the huge selection of BMW's online and the prices.  The customer service i received through email was just great and I was able to reserve my BMW for up to three days and when I arrived it was ready to test drive, no waiting!  I purchased a 2017 X5 and the price was perfect!!  I didn't have to haggle or go back and forth on the price and Sergik was a great salesman, gentleman and super kind as well.  Finance was so helpful and wonderful to work with, no pressure! Great guy in finance.  The way this dealership treats you will make you want to continue to purchase additional BMW's for your family, but to purchase them only at Valencia BMW!!<//text><gmapID>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881</gmapID>< name>

Took my 2000 323ci in for service about a recall notice for passenger side airbags.  Service advisor (Vanessa) was pleasant and helpful.  Work was done promptly in a few hours.  Shuttle (driven by Juan and Thomas) provided door to door transportation for me with pleasant conversation. Also requested new wiper blades but did not receive $15 discount per my email notice.  Was advised of 3 items needing replacement due to oil leaks at a cost that is probably more than the car is worth, so will consult my mechanic.  Overall, mostly satisfied with entire experience.< /Text>

<Text>I came to this dealer on Weds July 8. Was there 4:30pm - 6pm. I was there on an appt with David Stratton. I thought it was strange he never offered to go show me the CPO X1, I was there for. He wanted to run a credit app already but I asked him to see the car. After an hour of waiting, I was told someone else had already bought the car so he started showing me other cars. The next day he calls me saying car is still available????

On top of this, I handed him my key and registration card so his used car sales manager could do an appraisal for my trade-in. I got my key back but not my registration. My trade in had been detailed and cleaned out before so I know I didn't lose it in there. I walked out with just my phone, wallet and my key.  I called him 2 days after asking if he could help me look for it and check with the used car sales manager. I told him I didn't mind having to get a replacement but if he could please check and get back to me. He seemed more concerned about still trying to sell me a car and was asking me sales related questions. He never got back to me. I texted him to follow-up and never got a response.</Text><name>Martin Arevalo<//name><Resp>{'time': 1594672162520, 'text': "Martin, we regret your experience with us here, but are glad you brought this to our attention.

I had a great experience at Valencia BMW.  I worked with Mitch who was very helpful and knowledgeable.  While they did not have the car I wanted on the lot, he helped by checking the stock they have at their other dealerships in their network.  Overall it was a pleasant experience!< /Review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>I tried doing a walk-in oil change for my BMW X3, and after checking in with the receptionist, it took 45 minutes and nobody even came to check in the car for the service. At this point, I decided to make an appointment for oil change and inspection of the windshield water sprays for the following opening which happened to be the next day, I guess they aren’t too busy during COVID-19. I came back the following day and they didn’t have loaner car, even though I requested one, nor a shuttle back to my house. This service ended up taking all day after they determined alignment was off on a brand new car, and it wasn’t cover under warranty. Anyway, after a full day without car, two Uber rides, and $200 later the car was done. Needless to say, I’m not coming back to this dealer for services nor for businesses.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881<//gmap_id>< Pics>

I bought a CPO car here and it was seamless from beginning to end. My salesperson, Jeffry, was on top of it from the moment I submitted an inquiry, and answered all my emails right away, sometimes in the middle of the night! When I arrived for my appointment, my car was already pulled up and waiting for my test drive so there was no waiting around. Hamid in finance was amazing also, explaining everything in great detail to my satisfaction. Throughout the process I never felt any pressure to buy something I didn't want. Excellent service all around.< /Text>

<time>1603342425487< /time><Rating>1</Rating><Text>I was sold a vehicle with non working tailights.   I was driving with my children in the car for 10 days before getting pulled over and received a ticket. I took the car back where I was given a rental for a week because there was a backorder. When I picked up my vehicle, I noticed the dealer had replaced my non working factory lights with CHEAP AFTERMARKET parts because they said OEM was too expensive. Sean Crawford said he would order the OEM lights, I haven't heard back. Taylor hawking lied to me and gave the run around for a week. Leslie ceballos sold me the vehicle with non working tailights. She also offered to get me a price on a second key thus wasting my time for 2 weeks when I decided to just order one myself. Poor customer service.

Update: The General Manager Niko called me, apologized after reading my review and promised me the factory OEM Taillights. Its been 4 months and have not heard anything from ANYONE at Valencia BMW.< /Text>< pictures>

It’s a nice place, the only thing is they charge a $198 diagnostic fee per each thing they find wrong with your BMW. That can add up fast. It does go towards the final cost of the repair but if you decide not to get your car fixed there then you’ll be out a few hundred just on a diagnosis! You can find somewhere cheaper, like Vic’s Bimmer in Lancaster with a $80 diagnostic fee. Even Edgar from Bayerische Motors in Palmdale will tell you everything wrong with your BMW for only one fee. Not everyone in Valencia has money like that, ok :/< /Review>

<review>The service was ok although I asked for them to wash my car. I couldn't really tell if they washed it because the insides they didn't touch. Maybe they washed the outside but didn't do a good job. I'd expect for a luxury car this service should be included. I did pay for service initially during the lease agreement. Additionally they lost or misplaced my key and waited for at least 45 min in spite of them calling me informing me my car is ready. Maybe they were backed up with lots of cars due to 4th of July weekend but I expect more.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

excellent experience from A to Z except when i had to deal with the finance manager who over charged me by $200 and argued he was correct before i had to speak to his manager and i turned out to be correct. Other than that the process was smooth and their professional. I recommend buying from them. Mayro Mitri the salesman was excellent<//review>

My experience with Robert G. at Valencia was above and beyond. He knows his stuff and he's fair. Once  I decided on the options I wanted he made the build process a breeze. Any question I had he was quick to answer and when it came time to delivery him and his assistant Brita made delivery straight forward. Was in and out of there in a couple of hours. Definitely can be challenging to find a good dealership and an even better staff, but highly recommend Robert and can't wait to purchase my next BMW from him.< /Review>

Dropped my 2016 Comp M4 convertible off for service at 5:30 PM in the Afternoon. Was ready by 8 AM the following Morning. This despite the fact that it was free under the service program that came with the car. Chis (the Advisor) was extremely knowledgeable, professional, courteous and timely in terms of keeping me informed. Could not ask for more.</text>

<Review>Excellent customer service and repair. I arrived without an appt due to immediate issue of having a bolt puncture in my run flat tire. Vanessa greeted me after I signed in. She took a look and since I had a tire warranty she sent me on my way. She called me about 30 minutes later to let me know it would be covered under the warranty and they would take care of it the same day. Two hours later Vanessa called to let me know my car was ready and she also had the oil change and maintenance done as well. I arrived to pick up my car 10 minutes later and my car was being driven to the front to greet me. Excellent!</Review>< UserId.>

< Review>
I am absolutely in love with Valencia BMW. This is my second lease with them and I plan to continue leasing/ or financing all my cars from them. The service is impeccable from start to finish. The finance managers, sales personnel, front desk receptionist are all welcoming and greet with the best of customer service regardless of who you are or in my case what you look like that particular day ( make up or no make up lol) I would especially like to thank Vanessa Chung in the service dept for her warmth kind-hearted. Energy she gives me every encounter we have had. She knows her job and is always available to go above any beyond for her customers/clients. I can’t thank Valencia BMW enough for all that they have done for me and my family over these past 4 years! Looking forward to many more years and great experiences. You guys are PHENOMENAL! Sincerely a life long customer.</Review>

Words cannot describe the level of professionalism, courtesy, comfort and ease I experienced during the Lease process of my new BMW. Mr. Kia, you are absolutely the best there is as a consultant and manager. Jeff, your attention to detail and specialized personal care is second to none. Mr. Hamid, in 15 minutes of processing paperwork, I feel we have known each other for a lifetime and have established the same level of trust found among good friends. Thank You all.<//review>

<text>Jonathan @ BMW is awesome - knows all about the electric i3 which I just bought, and is a genius.  They assigned him to answer my questions and of course we discussed the batteries.

My impression is that the car runs almost forever with very little service needed.  I'll find out over the next decade.

I only drive 30 or 40 miles a day, and have the Level 1 charging set up in my garage, in just a normal electric outlet, like I would use to plug anything in.  A Level 1 charger comes with the car.

About every 3 or 4 days, I re-charge my i3 overnight.  More frequently if I'm going to be travelling a long way the next day.  I love not going to gas stations anymore, although I may have to someday if I use the range extender, but it will be a long time.

Thanks to Jonathan, and to BMW!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>The two Internet sales team members I worked with were very knowledgeable, professional and helpful. I reserved the vehicle online and received a reply from a team member very quickly and not just an automated reply but a personal one.  Our situation was not the usual walk into the dealership and buy a car and that didn't faze them. We would definitely buy another car from them.  They had the best vehicle and price. Their internet sales team is fantastic!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

However, the service staff could have washed the car since it was in the shop for 5 days. It would be nice to get your car back freshly washed.<//Review><date>1617835165123</date><rate>4<//rate>< gmap_id>

<review>Love this place.  Bob Rowland’s oversees maintenance for our to X6 50i’s.  He knowledgeable, thorough, professional, and courteous.  He always has a loaner ready for us and is prompt in letting us know our cars are ready.  Always a wonderful experience!  Polo Lopez is the best sales manager anywhere.  He’s honest, fair, and is dedicated to keeping his clients happy for the life of their cars as well as for transitioning to new vehicles.<//review>< username>

<Review>Valencia BMW totally cheated me ! when i walked in on 02/08/2020 i made it crystal clear that i wanted an "optional contract" so that i would have 5 days to finance through my credit union at the best rate, the finance representative"EDDIE"  continued to go on bout how nobody else could do better than the rate he'd gotten for me (lies my bank cut it in half) ,after signing paperwork and driving off in my car i followed up with emails to my car salesman confirming that i had this in place and all i needed to do was have my bank contact the dealership so they could mail the check for my vehicle.Once my bank approved me and was ready to mail the check communication STOPPED and all of a sudden the finance representative EDDIE was "out of town" My credit union and i made SEVERAL attempts to contact the finance area to get information on where to send payment via phone/email we received no communication!My bank sent the payment for my vehicle overnight on 2/12/2020 it was received by "mike" on 2/13/2020 at 11am but they NEVER CASHED IT. I am now being contacted by a finance company named Ally as they show i owe them payment for my vehicle but i have already paid my car note to my bank and the following car note is due in a few days,Thanks to valencia BMW i now have two loans for the same vehicle on my credit report, and when i reach out to valencia BMW for assistance or an explanation as to what may have happened "Gary Azaan" the finance manager was EXTREMELY rude and continued to cut me off and say "well we didn't receive your check, its simple have ally contact your bank " before he even took the time to pull up my account, i constantly expressed i'm only calling for help and hes being rude to me he answered "well i have customers" as if he wasn't speaking to one and his dealership did not have anything to do with the HUGE mistake that was made.

i now have to dispute the loan with Ally through Transunion as they have reported i am late because i have two car loans for the same vehicle .

i love my car but if i could go back in time i would have NEVER purchased a vehicle from this dealership.

i would NEVER recommend this dealership to ANYONE! they will try to scam you to gain any type of interest they my be able to benefit off of, once you drive off the lot you are worthless!!!!!!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1588181608275, 'text': 'Sache, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback.

My husband and I had a great experience at Valencia BMW. Jeffry reached out in response to an inquiry about a vehicle we were interested in. He worked with us to find the vehicle we wanted and helped us get a great deal on a brand new BMW! We visited just to see what they could offer, but couldn't pass up a great deal. Entire team was very friendly and they constantly congratulated us!</text>

I have an oil leak in my car. Took it to BMW dealer and the service said that it does not have a problem. I see oil in my garage on the floor. I think they do not want to fix it because it is still under warranty. I am very unhappy with this dealer.<//review>

Horrible experience we get there to fix our recall air conditioner on a BMW a little older model than the new ones they have their they return the car 3 hours later to give you the car back with the AC fix but we get our car with non-working Windows non-working lights no blinkers and the attended there says that they might be able to fix it what do you mean you might you broke it I need you to fix my car so tomorrow morning we'll be going in there and to hopefully they can fix what they broke are we going to be going to small claims and I'm letting everybody know that this is the scamming thing going on and they scanned the wrong person because I'm a hardworking person I have no money to give you🤬<//Review>

Be very careful when you buy a used car from this dealer and never trust their inspection reports always take your car to independent shop or mechanic. Bought a used car from these guys and turned out the car had front wheel misalignment, and after having an inspection done my shop told I need need new suspension shocks. After talking to Valencia BMW they said they will not do or fix anything and at this point I couldn’t make them. Anyway this cost me a lot of money and time to fix.  Also they told me they will send me an additional key fob, guess what never got it.< /review>

I dropped my car off and was told it would be ready by end of day ... I inquired if I could pick up the car after hours since I work later than the service center.
I called to make sure my care was ready ... the service center had just closed and I called sales.
Nobody had called me to tell me whether my car would be ready ... when I called they had no information that my car was there ... I asked to speak
To a manager I got a recording ... so I tried again .. I called and talked to 4 different people ...
None of them were able to transfer me to a manager ... the following day was a holiday and the service center was closed ... so finally I spoke to someone at the service center where I was told my service agent wasn’t in ... I asked about my car and they said it would take the day ... I complained and they got it ready in 2 hours ... they asked if I wanted a wash ... the exterior was done but not the inside ... plus since I have a 530e they didn’t charge the car .... for a luxury brand I was shocked ...  definitely not high end service ... I’m really not impressed<//text>

<review>Isaac and Lence were very helpful, nice and courteous.  Isaac assisted us with inventory and test driving the car. He was very patient and friendly while we asked all of our questions about the features of the car, and in the test drive. Lence was there to help us with final decision of the right car, and answered any other questions we had. He also assisted with  the financing and expedite it. Between the two of them, purasing my BMW X7 was a very nice and painless experience.
I will certainly buy another car from these two gentlemen.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1583275293982, 'text': "Vivi, it is great to read such wonderful comments about your recent experience with us!

I came from Fresno to pick my up a CPO ( BMW of Fresno, Modesto, Roseville, Berkley, San Rafael and the bay are closer to me, so that should say something)
Priced to sell. Excellent communication, flexible options with a good follow up.

I took it in for it's first service since purchasing this vehicle and as always I was greeted immediately upon arrival.  My service advisor promised my car back to me with the 40,000 mile service the same day.  Everything was taken care of and the car was returned to me the same day.  Car was washed and ready to go when I arrived to pick it up.

Service was excellent from beginning to the end. Jasmine kept me posted all the time regarding time frame to accomplish service.

The only reason I put four stars instead of five is that my vehicle wasn't washed.

I discovered this a little bit later when I saw car under bright sun.

Hopefully, I'll get it done on Saturday as promised by Jasmine without waiting too long.<//review>

<user_name>WILLMADAIN11< /user_name><UserId.>102662861729338080259<//UserId.><review>lousy place, bad service. service rep Robert was not as helpful as I expected. first thing he told me that  they didn't have a loaner even though I called 2 hours earlier and made sure one is available for me since I was driving 25  miles to get to dealership, after we checked with the front dest lady she said one is available for me, which I got.
when I picked up the car they changed the oil, hopefully fixed the recall issue
the last issue was that when i turn off the car and open the door, the radio and the screen does not turn off most of the time. ( sometimes it turns off and sometimes it doesn't). Robert sent me to the cashier to pick the papers and the key, he didn't walk with me, and didn't bother to explain what was done. when I questioned him about the issue of the radio and screen, it seemed that he didn't know whether it was checked out or not, he was not helpful or concerned for my concern, he told me to check with the genius desk at that dealership. I went there, and nobody was there, a salesperson told that all the geniuses are out delivering  cars.
so that issue has not been resolved and it seems that I have to take the car to another dealer to check it out. definitely not going back to Valencia BMW.<//review></record>

Good service recommendation. Didn't have to wait to get in and work was done the same day. Nice loaner car. Service advisor was very customer friendly. His name is Jesse Colon. Will go there again.

Dropped off my 550I for a few repairs. Upon pulling up I was greeted by a guy who asked if I had an appointment or not and was escorted inside to check in. The front cashier was extremely polite and had patience with my speech impediment. I ended up working with Bob, great guy. During the couple hours wait, the salesman spoke with me about general stuff of the time and made the wait more enjoyable. The coffee was pretty darn good, but I did not use the donuts. I ended up getting a loaner due to repairs that were foreseen. Beautiful loaner car that is taken care of for sure. I know my car is being taken care of until I pick it back up! I will definitely continue to use this locations services.</Text>

I came into the BMW to see my options of buying a new car & I was greeted by Wesley Ramos. He is AMAZING!!! He’s so knowledgeable and friendly. I feel like he’s a friend rather than a salesmen trying to make a sale! I really appreciated his help and his words of advice and his knowledge of the cars!

Maryo and Eddy were exceptional!  The buying/paperwork process necessarily requires more time than one would imagine but Maryo and Eddy managed us through the process effectively and efficiently.  We're quite happy with our new X3 and unreservedly recommend Valencia BMW if you're considering a BMW.  By the way, we drove a fair bit to do business with them as they offered a deal that made the drive worth it.< /review>

Filed an Unfair Sales Practice with BMW Corporate office and also filing a BBB complaint.

Be VERY aware of the finance representative Gary Kazandjian who works at  Valencia BMW, California. He is without a doubt a 100% scam pusher. I purchased a BMW X5 on July 24, 2018. The car had 45k miles on it. At Gary's office, he asked me how long I would use the car for. I replied I was going to use it for about 3-4 years. He recommended an extended warranty for 36 month or 36K miles and an extended maintenance package through BMW for 72 months or 100K whichever would come first. This perfectly suited my needs. The only thing Gary forgot to mention was that the extended maintenance package started counting the miles and months from the day the car was MANUFACTURED, not purchased. He sold me a policy of $2500 for 13 month. The sales person was not better. He told me that the wheels balancing was done. I later discovered that was a lie. I had to spend another $140 out of my pocket. I believe car buyers should avoid this dealership if they didn't want to be scammed / hurt financially.</Text>

Orson Van Gay! If you're in the market for a BMW, which I wasn't, or you see a used car you like in their inventory, which I did, you want to work with Orson. He listens to what you say and hears what you mean. He is a different kind of car salesman! I recommend buying your next vehicle from Orson.

I was searching online for days for my perfect used Lexus RX350 and had seen a couple at other dealerships just to be given lies and the run around at our appointments there. I found a 2011 RX350 at Valencia BMW so to avoid the planned games and sales gimmicks, decided to just drive in and surprise them. Orson met us at the door. He was more interested in meeting my wife and I then getting to business on a car and when we told him we were looking for a specific car from their website he knew exactly which one it was. Orson is very knowledgeable about the vehicles and made the buying process painless. I really appreciate that he did not try to push us into a new car, or even one different than we wanted. When we decided we wanted to buy the car, he had the paperwork drawn up by Mack and set up a wash and fuel up while we waited in the lobby. We walked in at 11am, test drove the car and signed papers and were out by 3 with our new used car and have loved every moment since we walked on the car lot up to today and counting. Thank you Orson, we love our car.</Review>

I came in for my very first service after buying my 330i at another dealership, that I will not discredit, and everything went really well. I showed up late to my appointment and Bob still took care of me. Not only did he did do that but I had ran over something and opted for rim and tire insurance when I bought the car from the other dealership. The other dealership didn’t wanna deal with it so they just brushed me off and Bob handled it the great poise. Honesty, I should’ve bought my car here and completely regret not doing exactly that. Huge shout out to this facility. I commend them on their service. Only downfall was I wish I could’ve gotten a loaner car but there was some miscommunication when scheduling the appt. and it wasn’t an option when I originally scheduled. But besides that, flying colors!< /text>

Robert was awesome!  Although it was quite a long wait, Robert got me in and out of there considering the work that had to be done to my car.  I went in for a routine service but Robert found a nail in my tire and took care of it along with some software updates.  He is easy to get a hold of when calling for updates and is a pleasure to work with. Great Guy!  they have will take you anywhere while you wait and my son and I found an indoor playground at the mall that was a perfect pass time!  Thank you AutoNation BMW Service!<//Text>

<Text>I called Wednesday 11/20/19 to schedule my alignment for Saturday 11/23/19 at 10am. I spoke to "Gabby" who said the alignment was $199.95 and that to forward the email to my brother (who was taking the vehicle in for me as I was out of the country) so he can show them the code for the 15% discount BMW sent me. When he took the car they told him it was actually $289 but he would "hook him up" for $199.95, this was obviously a deceptive move. When I called 11/25/19 to report the issue and obtain my credit, I spoke to "Darren" who ensured me he would call me back to get this "settled". I waited for his call but it never came. I had to call him back on my vacation from Italy so obviously I feel lied to already. I called when I returned from Italy on 12/02/19 and again I was on hold for "Darren" and at that point he advised me BMW would send me a check for the difference. The refund was $30 and he said it would take 10 business days from the date he would put the request in to receive it. Well not to my surprise, nothing has been received nor a phone call from "Darren" explaining and apologizing for his horrible lack of customer service. I followed up 12/20 again and "Gabby" ensured someone would call me back supposedly and nobody did of course. At this point it's about principle and not the money. I followed up again and spoke to "Mike" and he proceeded to promise someone would call me back. He gave me his number as well and he said he tried and followed up with a "higher manager". As of 12/26 nobody has followed up. Needless to say, this is not the experience one would expect from leasing a vehicle from BMW and it is very sad the quality of the cars dont match up with the service and people they have in place to run their business. Someone dropped the ball here and simply does not care to pick it up and do the right thing. My fiance was ending his lease in 2020 on his car and was looking to lease here but after this, he is staying far from these deceptive people. After reading all of this also know that this is my FIRST lease through BMW so I'm a FIRST time customer and this is how they treat me? I'm advising everyone of my experience and to not come here.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

He contacted me not once, but twice by phone call and also by email. He didn't give up haha and replied to my email quick. He waited for me and had everything ready. He is supper helpful and nice.

<text>My purchasing experience at Valencia BMW was extremely pleasant. I sent an email inquiry and was contacted immediately. Lance was very transparent and attentive to all of my needs. Amir in finance was amazing, too. I was traveling and left with a beautiful car. I've bought many cars and this was the very best experience thus far. This dealership exceeded my expectations!< /text>< pictures>

Had a real good visit with the used car sales dept. The guy helping us was great and spent lots of time explaining everything even though I ultimately didn't buy the car . Just had my first service here 8/27/19 (bought the car elsewhere) really, I'm vary impressed with BMW all the way around. They have great customer service, I was in & out in less than two hours they did everything I needed. They answered questions with genuinely kind smiles .  I don't have one of the crazy expensive cars they offer, as nice as they are I can't afford all that, just a modest 5 series but I got the same services as all the others. I will be back as needed .< /text>

<Review>Horrible Experience. Avoid at all costs.
Leased a 2019 X5 which was delivered with a major flaw in control panel. Dealer replaced the parts impacted but in return scratched the leather trim on the dash. Took the car in to repair that and they returned the car with a damaged wood trim on the center console. The dealer refuses to deal with the damage now after escalating the horrible quality of service to BMW corporate. If you care about customer service and workmanship do not go to this dealership.

UPDATE: Someone from the dealership copy pastes a canned response to negative reviews asking you to contact the GM. I assure you the GM has no interest in talking to you or resolving the issues as I have left messages with him and received no call back.

We just took delivery of our BMW 228i. We are so excited to receive this car and want to thank Lilly Rodriguez at Valencia BMW for making the purchase so easy and pleasant. She was so responsive and helpful by email and phone and stayed with us every step of the way.

We really did our homework as this is our first new car purchase. We reached out to over 10 dealerships in the Los Angeles area. Lilly gave us the best service, price and was the easiest sales person to work with. We are so grateful to work with her and excited to start driving our car. She even came out and delivered the car and made the whole process a breeze. Thanks again, Lilly, keep up the great work!

Valencia BMW also has a genius team who helps you learn the car and they will come to your home. We had Madison come and she went over the every question we had. It really helped to have someone show us the features and functionality of the car as there is so much to absorb!<//Text>

<review>My Sales Associate Nick was amazing, but the Finance manager threw me out of his office when I asked for clarification regarding my lease. If you can find the same deal somewhere else, just do yourself the favor an avoid this dealership. Nick by himself receives five stars, dealership 3 because of how clean it is, 0 stars for the finance guy (I think his name was Kai).</review>< pics>

After a resent service was performed on my BMW, I discovered my pre-sets for my radio and tailgate had been removed. This was especially troubling when I raised the tailgate in my garage and the tailgate hit the top of my garage door.  😢. Thankfully the tailgate was not scratched.  Would have been nice if I was given a heads up!  Joyce Sagehorn< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Valencia Bmw mechanic took my Bmw 5 series for a test drive, and had an accident in my car. Now my car a total lost. Dealer is not being responsible for my car! I went through my insurance to get this situation done ASAP. Also, Valencia bmw did not call me in regards to the accident, I had to call them and ask what’s going on with my car. It’s a total lost. I’m glad the mechanic is okay, but my car is lost. So all the money I paid for my bmw is gone.
I would like for a Valencia bmw to reach out to me and get me a car, just like mine. And I would like to pay only the balance I owed, not a new balance of 50k plus! Henry manager didn’t not help, as well as Vanessa the service rep. I felt really ignored and very sad my car was gone. But let me say that my car was only coming in for an oil change. And bmw said it needed a radiator and a new holes. So they did this job to charge my warranty insurance. So they will get paid for the service, parts, storage (175.00), a day and whatever they can charge the other party who hit my car.
So I really hope Valencia Bmw really stains up to the plate and calls me to see what they will do to get me into a bmw again. To bad I can’t upload the pictures of my total car.
Just needed to be honest here.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My SA, Bob was really kind and knowledgeable through all the process. Also his explanation and recommendation helped me choose the best remedy options on the problems. Definitely I will visit the place and looking for Bob if any problem happens to my car again.</review>

Valencia BMW's entire team was awesome from start to finish. No haggling, no stress, and was a very pleasant experience. Their finance team was great and worked with me to get the deal I wanted. Andreas sat down with me personally to explain my options and worked out a great deal. And my salesman Richie was top notch and so professional. He even drove my new BMW out to my house for my wife to look at it and test drive it. Of course she fell in love with the car. Overall, my experience was so easy and everyone that worked there was so cool and easy to talk to. I seriously recommend Valencia BMW to anyone looking to buy a great car at a great price, with no stress!< /text>

<Review>I had a wonderful experience. All negotiations were handled in a few email exchanges. The car was held for me a few days while I sorted out things with my insurance.  The car was ready to test drive the moment I got to the dealership. A few minutes with the finance office and we were done. I’d definitely go back to BMW of Valencia.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Thomas Berry< /Name>< gmap_id>

<Text>Before my maintenance package expired I took my car in to be serviced and advised them that I would like to get as much done before the expiration.  A few thousand miles later, I returned to the dealership for an oil change and was presented with a laundry list of recommended services totaling more than $1200. In speaking with other BMW owners I have learned that this is the norm with the dealership and their markups.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I live 80 miles south in Orange County and I could easily get my BMW's elsewhere.  However, Valencia BMW stands head and shoulders above all of their peers with their impeccable customer service and best-in-class pricing.  There is simply no justification to buy or lease your BMW's anywhere else.  The sales manager, Polo Lopez, makes you feel like you're dealing with family and you're pleasantly treated as a long-term client and not a one-time customer.  I'm on my 3rd BMW from Valencia.</Review>< response>

First, my sales guy was amazing. Gary was so nice and respectful. My finance guy was awesome. Super sweet, helpful and completely amazing. Now, the managers suck. They had this superior attitude when they spoke to me which is demeaning and disrespectful. Idk if it because I was a woman or what. I handled my own financing and basically did their jobs for them in under 5 mins with better rates. I. Highly disappointed in this behavior from a luxury dealership.<//review>

After I do it, hurting my score, they tell me that my score wasn't 750 so the best price was again $628 (even liying about my CREDIT score).

Really bad experience here.  I was primed to buy a CPO M3.  The salesman assigned Sergik treated me as if he was doing me a favor by selling me the car.  No selling of its features, no friendliness, no small talk, and several references to my husband.  It was not welcoming at all.  Nice to know car buying is still the same for women as it was in the 80s.  I called to ask for a different sales person, and was directed to the sales manager who explained to me as if I was a 4 yo  what no haggle pricing meant.  It took two calls with him to get him to acknowledge I was entitled to a nationally advertised loyalty credit.  He assigned me a different sales person, a woman (safe right? Someone who can speak my lady language), who had not been primed at all on my deal and fumbled through why they had already offered the interest rates they had and could not answer any questions without rechecking with the sales manager.  If they had treated me with respect and the quality of service I expect from BMW I would have walked out of there that evening with that car.  Instead I am writing this review, and will find the car elsewhere.</Review>

Service was great! Our salesman was very helpful, let us test drive where we wanted to, and gave us our space when my partner and I discussed the car. They even patiently waited while we tried to receive the paperwork needed on our phones (took a very long time to get the paycheck stub from work).
The only critique I have is that we made an appointment on a Tuesday to go in on a Friday. We chose the car we wanted to test drive while setting up the appointment. When we got the confirmation email, it said the car would be ready for us to drive when we showed up. Well, it wasn't. And we had to wait about 20 minutes for our salesperson to find the car and get it ready for us. Put a bit of a sour taste in our mouth right from the start unfortunately. He did turn it around by the end though!<//text>

Valencia BMW gave me a great experience. Everyone was professional but took the time to make me feel comfortable. They also took the time to offer water or coffee every little while. The service department was great too. My car was taken care of and it was done in a reasonable amount of time. I will definitely keep my business there and I recommend it to anyone else looking to buy a car or go for a service.<//review>

☆☆Wesley is the man! ☆☆ I felt so educated and trusting in my desicion to buy the BMW I purchased yesterday. He's a professional, kind and a no pressure salesman. (And patient, I wanted to test drive 5 cars). He gets you the best deal with a huge smile. ☆☆< /review>

I am not a typical customer. I went in, knew what I wanted and got it. Buck made the whole experience easy and efficient and worked with me even though my bank was closed during the weekend. It was easy to follow the paperwork requirements and the whole team helped to ensure everything was covered. I never felt like I was trying to be sold something else/another service. Very friendly, personable, and attentive to me as a customer. Well done!<//Text>

<text>I just purchased my second BMW from BMW Valencia. Both times, I worked with Aladdin. He provided excellent service and follow up during our research process. The dealership is a no hassle type dealership and we were able to come to mutually agreeable terms in a very painless and timely fashion. Additionally, their service team is excellent. Easy to make a reservation with prompt service.
I would highly recommend this dealership.<//text>< userid>

Our service representative Jesse was fantastic throughout the repair process.  He was conscientious to the costs involved and provided an equally sized loaner car for our use. Jesse made our experience with Valencia BMW very pleasant.<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>“Terrible service”  I went in for an oil change and to get my fluids topped off on a Saturday and they told me it would only take an hour and a half to complete.  When I returned they said (Representative  “Cole”) said they couldn’t finish as planned and gave me a loaner car so I left after I was told it I would receive a call from him confirming my car would be ready to pick up on Monday but he didn’t plus it wasn’t  ready and when I asked to speak with a supervisor I was told by the receptionist that they were either busy or out of the office. Then “Cole” finally called Wednesday saying my car would be ready Thursday and they didn’t even wash it before I picked it up.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

It was easy no haggling the price.  They only tried to add extended warranty on, but didn't pressure you in any direction.  Car was washed and fueled when ready to leave.  Everything was very smooth and they got me out quickly.< /Review>

My service rep, Bob, was courteous and professional. He apologized for my 20 minute wait, a walk in had delayed him. Not sure why a walk in has priority over my scheduled appointment. But Bob made up for it by arranging to have my service completed, normally a two hour process, in just over an hour! Thanks! Also appreciated the fact that the waiting area is well ventilated, chairs are 6 feet apart, and all staff were masked.< /review>

< review>
My previous car was unexpectedly acting up (miles approx 125K) When I brought the car in, Mike T, service specialist, got me into a loaner so I could continue my day.  It was a brand new 4 series.

After various tests, they suspected it's the transmission. BMW dealership allowed me to drive the loaner until I have figured out what I wanted to do, fix the transmission or get into another car for approx 2 weeks. When I asked if Mike T could recommend any BMW sales person, he referred me to Willie Dalgan.

Based on previous experience, I cringed the thought of working with a salesperson, the purchasing process, etc Willie was so amazing to work with!!!  He understands the customer, the shopping experience was so much fun with no pressure.  It's been now 4 days of driving behind the wheel of my BMW 535 luxury line and loving it!!! Oh, and love the massage seat function and the cooling seats!!!

I shared this amazing experience with my siblings and parents. My parents and brother are non BMW drivers. They can't wait to work with Willie.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><Time>1464807248788</Time><text>Interacting with BMW of Valencia has been the worst customer service experience of my life.

I have tried repeatedly to speak with representatives in the finance department spanning 2 months.

At first, I assumed they were genuinely busy and left voicemail messages.  To date, no one from the dealership has ever returned a phone message I’ve left.

One day, I asked a receptionist to page someone overhead.  That got me a live person in finance, who gave me the wrong answer.

The last time I spoke with them, I decided to go above finance and speak to a manager.  He was brought on the line and while I readied the paperwork to discuss with him, he hung up on me.

I have no explanation for why their service is poor other than to say they do not care about their customers.  I’ve never had another car dealership treat me this way and all I want is resolve a simple issue that could have been taken care of months ago if someone in finance could take 10 minutes out of their day to actually speak with me on the phone.

By all means, buy a car from BMW of Valencia, the sales reps are great.  But if you have an issue that needs to be sorted out with finance after the transaction, good luck.</text><gmapID>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881</gmapID><response>{'time': 1465588396409, 'text': "Nathan, we regret your experience with us here, but are glad you brought this to our attention.

<review>I have had my new BMW for a year now and each time I have had to take it to the dealership for a class in how to drive it or any issues that have come up, I have been extremely pleased with the service. Each person I have spoken to has been helpful, knowledgeable and easy to talk to.  Robert Perez, my service advisor has been especially helpful in walking me through what has needed to be done each time.  I am so glad I bought the BMW because I have had no issues that were not resolved quickly and easily by the service staff of the BMW genius. They are always helpful!!!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

BMW Valencia was a great experience! As soon as you walk on the lot you are greeted and helped by someone. Orson Van Gay was the person that helped me from start to finish. He listened to exactly what I wanted and showed me the options I was looking for. The financing options through the dealership itself would not work with my budget, so they let me bring in my own financing option and gave me a few days to work it out. Orson even helped me secure/save the car on his day off for a time when I was able to come back and pick it up.</text>

Lance was fantastic.  He was very transparent from the beginning all the way through the end and made sure I got all the rebates and discounts that were applicable.  He made the whole process so easy and everything was ready by the time we went to pick up the car. Also, the finance part was no hassle and quick.  I came here all the way from south bay and it was well worth it and will definitely come back.< /Text>

I purchased my vehicle about a week ago and I am loving it! My experience was the best! I felt very welcomed and comfortable that I made the right decision. Tony (Anthony) is amazing!! He showed such compassion and care in helping me and I felt like I was able to trust him. I would highly Recommend him to my family and friends as I know he will take good care of them. We need more salesman like Tony that actually cares about his clients in making sure we are happy with our purchase. The whole process was amazing, all the way to the end when I met with the Financial Manager, Manny! My experience was the best!! Thank you!!!< /Review>

Great experience with Darin. I received a good explanation of what issues would not be covered under warranty and he set me up with a courtesy vehicle. When I picked the car up that afternoon, every issue was fixed, the car was detailed, and everything was covered under warranty.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I was in the market for purchasing a new BMW after my older car needed to eventually be replaced due to excessive repairs.

After shopping around, I had a general idea of the model I wanted to purchase. When I arrived at Valencia BMW, Westley greeted us with a warm welcome, and helped us find out exactly what we wanted.

He took time, we never felt rushed during any point in the process and gave us his undivided attention. Ultimately, we didn't find the car that 100 percent fit our needs on the lot, but he went above and beyond to find one that we loved by shipping a car from another Auto Nation dealership. He got us a great deal, and I couldn't be happier with the car (and price)!

Amir in Finance also helped us immensely. He was very personable, knowledgeable, and expedited the entire process and was a pleasure to do business with.

From start to finish, Westley made us feel like family, and he made a notoriously painful process easy, painless and fun. I usually never write reviews unless there is exceptional service, and this is no different. Thank you Westley for everything!</review>< Date>

Valencia BMW was a pleasure to work with. Their customer service was outstanding. My salesman Martin was knowledgeable, helpful, but never pushy. He worked hard to find me the perfect car and he did it! I LOVE my 3 series and am grateful to Valencia BMW everytime I get in it! Highly recommend this place!<//text>

I had great experience at BMW Valencia. The service was welcoming and I love my "2017 Honda Accord". I feel I got a great deal. The only thing is my car didn't come with floor mats and they couldn't supply them. Being that it's a BMW dealership. Now I have to go purchase my own floor mats. Otherwise I would have given them a 5-star.</review>

The Service department here at BMW Valencia is the worst.  We had an appointment for a standard service on the car. We sat in the waiting area for 30-minutes while we watched the woman that was to help us walk around and talk to other co-workers.  For some reason she walked inside and cam back in a client that had just pulled up and took him to her desk.
finally another service advisor (3-there and none of them doing anything) took our key and told us it would be taken care of.  No responSe.  Called back at 5 PM.  Was told car had not been checked in and no work was done?  Assure we would get a call back first thing in morning.  NO call.  Just called waited on phone for 20-minutes, was told car would be done in 45-minutes.  DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR THERE!<//text>

Fantastic & Friendly Car Buying Experience!! I’ve shopped for cars (like many people) for years and years and purchased from even a few different BMW dealerships, and this was by far, the nicest and easiest experience I’ve ever had. I always appreciate names and referrals, so here are mine for this store:

My salesperson, Maryo Metry (I recommend asking for him) was not only attentive to my questions and time I needed to look through their vehicle inventory, but he as well was just a nice human being to deal with. I never felt pressured by anything during the entire time I was there. I also had to split up my time into 2 different visits and he was always flexible in helping me.

Going through the Finance Department always takes time, but my experience with Eddie Ahmadie was perfect and easy. He is very down to earth and informative about the various programs that help with end-of-lease options. Even when I only wanted one of the programs as an add-on, he didn’t push on anything, which was so relaxing to deal with. Overall, I don’t know if you can ask for a specific finance person, but if so, ask for Eddie.

My final person that came in to meet me during my time was the Sales Manager, Sean Crawford. He treated both my wife and I with courtesy and respect and you can tell leads his sales team in the right ways. Overall this store just had a better vibe than others that I’ve visited (plus, with their recent renovation, it’s a great place to have to spend time).

I’m a long time BMW owner and know what to expect from this brand, and this store is a great representation of the brand. Thank you to everyone at Valencia BMW for making this experience so excellent! I look forward to servicing my new vehicle here as well as my next lease!<//Text>

The X5 I purchased was priced well. The SUV itself was nice.. Auto nation certified, but not BMW certified (although I purchased it from the dealer). Only big negative was the promises from our salesman (Jim).... He told us that they were going to get us the 2nd key (they only had 1 key when we went to purchase). He told us that he talked with the old owner and the owner was going to bring in the second key that week. I called him back that week and he gave me some BS story about the key being destroyed. I know its "fluff" when you talk to sales people.. but that is why I thought Autonation would be different... apparently not. Now I will have to purchase a 2nd key. Just reinforces how much I dislike dealerships and salesman... all BS just to take your money, no genuine morals and ethics. Oh well...< /text>

<Review>I am beyond amazed at how this place has such good reviews. Every time I take my car there for service it’s a nightmare. They can’t even get things right. Last time I was there the service advisor called me to tell me he forgot to tell me there were issues with my car but I would have to go back at a later time. Most recently I’ve left tons of messages to have a service advisor call me back to figure out something alerting in my car but no return calls nothing. I also left messages to have a service manager return my call and still nothing. Never have I ever had such an unpleasant experience at a dealership. I had to call bmw USA customer relations to complain about this dealership.</Review>< date>

<text>Excellent service, Darin was outstanding and took great care of both my X5 and myself. In/Out time was great and the car was washed. Love that oil changes by BMW are free for the first 30K miles. I bought a Mercedes a year ago for the business and the oil change at the dealer was $400.00.

Also they gave me a base package 320i for my M5, I understand they didn’t have many others at the time but still doesn’t seem like a fair trade off. Either way my experience was great and they gave me good advice of future care of my car.</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Valencia BMW is consistently the dealer to beat when it comes to inventory and pricing. They're the 1st or 2nd largest (volume) dealer in the country so they are designed to move product, not play games.< /text>

Showed up without an appointment,  to have them look at a faulty module, Luckily it was part of an extended warranty so did not have to pay.

The people working there were very cordial and friendly, they made sure i was taken care of and not just waiting around. I was offered a ride home and the individual that drove me was friendly, polite and genuinely a nice guy. Car was completed in less than an hour went back picked up  car (was washed) and left easy as 1, 2, 3. Or Uno dos, Tres... no matter what language it was a great experience.< /review>

Madison was fantastic.  She went above and beyond to find the 530e I was looking for and she made sure I got as many rebates and discounts that were possible.  Also, the finance part was no hassle and quick.  This is the second time I have bought a car from this dealership and I will definitely come back.<//Review>

He was no nonsense and totally upfront with the sale. Very helpful and happy to answer all my questions and had a great welcoming demeanour about him.

The dealership itself is what one would expect from BMW, top notch in all regards. Everyone there was rather helpful.
They could do with a snack table perhaps though!!

All in all, very happy with my experience. Oh and I love the car.<//text>< pictures>

<review>Buying a used car at Valencia BMW was easy, friendly and first rate. We found the perfect car  (used Toyota Corolla) through an AMEX special offers link. Yvliana Fetterhof called us as soon as we requested. She was the nicest and most knowledgeable person.Totally professional, she was not at all pushy, instead she let the car do the talking. Then, it was easy dealing with "Eddie," the person who actually signs the contract. He was helpful, understanding and got us a deal we couldn't refuse! I would definitely return here. However, I think the car we got will probably go a very long time before that happens.< /review>< Pics>

Brought in car for first service....the front desk people are really nice and friendly, will put smile on face.  Waited only a few minutes for Brian the advisor to walk me to his office to go over details, he even mentioned other things that needed attention or replacement.  Brian was also very friendly and professional and got me in and out within a reasonable time and addressed all my concerns with the car. I will definitely return for service.< /text>

I was looking to purchase my first used car, and thought I found a great deal. When I took the car to my mechanic, however, it turned out there was significant damage underneath the car (about $1k worth). Valencia BMW failed to disclose this damage to me before purchasing. Also, the rear brakes were significantly worn down, despite the dealership's claim of replacing brakes below 50% wear. Thankfully I was able to return it within the 5-day money back period. I strongly advise against buying used cars from this dealership!</Text>

My advice, pay attention in finance. When the finance person tells you there is a coupon available for X amount towards "additional coverage", dont be fooled. You are paying for said coupon. Look at your contract and notice there is no debit to offset the additional coverage.  Have them remove  the "coupon" and see how your monthly payment goes down.<//Text>

<UserId.>107308182265195446759<//UserId.><text>First, the advisor, Robert was extremely helpful and professional. I've had him before and I have no complaints whatsoever with him.

However, I had a bad experience trying to contact the service department. It took me a few days to finally get someone. I thought of even driving over just to be able to speak to someone. I tried to call many times. First I was put on hold for almost 15 minutes so I hung up and decided to call back. When I called back  I got a message saying to leave a voicemail message. I had a very quick question so I decided to call back and not leave a message. I called 2 more times and each time I was told they were busy and to leave a voicemail message so I finally did. I didn't get a call back so I called again the next day. I was told I needed to speak to an advisor so I was transferred and again and I was asked to leave a voicemail message which I did. Again I didn't get a call back. So I called back and I was told I needed to be transferred to an advisor. I finally told the girl that I've been trying for days to speak to someone so she finally made sure an advisor would be able to talk to me.

This is not the first time I've had dismal service with tying to contact service dept. last year I experienced the same thing of not being able to talk to someone and not getting a call back. I finally had to call the general manager and he forwarded the message to the service manager who was one of the ones who never called me back in the first place. I told her I left a voicemail message with the reception area as well as with the service manager. I didn't get a call back. She claimed there were no messages. It's hard to believe that both messages would not have been received. If this is the case, Valencia BMW had and still has a problem with their voicemail message system. Such a big company should know by now if there's a problem. There should be a policy of returning phone calls within 24 hours or even sooner but there doesn't seem to be. When I came in the 2 receptionist were chatting casually but perhaps they should be checking messages when they get a chance.

When I see this kind of service, I have to wonder how well my car would be taken care of if it needed repair.</text><time>1498569460312</time></record></dataset><record>

He was also helpful when I needed to obtain a loaner vehicle while I was waiting for the service of my vehicle.<//Text>

<review>Willie at Valencia BMW was a great help. He did everything to help me get in a vehicle that I love. He made the car buying experience very smooth and easy. He kept me updated with everything during the process. I definitely recommend him and his services for anyone looking for a new car.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881</gmap_id></record>

I had a great experience buying an 2018 X1 from here. It was a pleasure to work with Jeffry Portillo from e-commerce sales.  Throughout the buying process, he was professional and patient answering all our questions and taking our requirements into consideration, while finding the right car for us. Thank you once again Jeffry! It was a pleasure meeting you!</review>

Valencia BMW have done two repairs on my 335i. And both times, they have an excellent work. Customer service and support has been outstanding. Therefore, thumps up to the BMW-team in Valencia. I appreciate their attention to detail.

Valencia BMW always takes good care of me during service visits.  From my service professional Darin who answers all my questions thoroughly and always goes out of his way to get me my loaner car on short notice to nancy who is always so nice and helps me at the front desk.

<Resp>None</Resp><Pics>None< /Pics><review>Very nice staff. Jesse Colón in the service department is a triple star professional. He went over and beyond the call for me.
He is the total reason for my 4 star rating.
It is a bit smaller compared to other locations that I have been accustom too in LA. I am eager to see the finished product.

Cons:
This being my first time at this location, they need a bit more direction when you pull up for a service. They told me to park the car and no one walked up to take my information or tell me where I was suppose to go next. I stood there for 5 to 10 minutes looking confused, one of the 4 attendance finally told me to go inside. My thought is because everything has been displaced they don't have a system in place. I will make a second review after things have been completed.

At other bmw locations that I have gone too my car was returned lightly washed and vacuumed. I assumed this was the same at all BMW services, I guess not. You just assume all locations offer the same services 🙄.<//review><Name>John Colon</Name>< rate>

The best part of this experience is the personal that works there they were so helpful and kind specially lily Rodrigues , very understanding and professional , she answer all the questions we had and made the process smooth , I can’t wait for my Rover lease to end in dec /Jan , so I can lease a 6x suv , if your looking for a new luxury car try VALENCIA BMW were they treat you like family ( ask for lily Rodriguez) you won’t regret it .</text><time>1565969337478<//time></record>

<Review>Buyer Beware !  I strongly advise against buying a used vehicle from Valencia BMW.  After reading through other reviews, what happened to us seems like common practice.  We purchase a used vehicle a few days ago and had it inspected by a mechanic.  The mechanic found 2 oil leaks, worn brakes, and unmatched tires during the inspection.  All of these issues would lead to serious and expensive repairs if not addressed.

We purchased the vehicle at a fair, no haggle price from a dealer that sells the ultimate driving machines. But at a substantially higher price than from a private party.  A dealer that in my opinion was honest, reputable, and customer focused.  A dealer that conducted a 125 point vehicle inspection. Yet this vehicle was placed on the lot for sale.

We returned with the vehicle and informed them of the issues.  The service manager personally inspected the vehicle and after approximately an hour, he shared his results.  He found the oil leaks, gave us the worn measurements on the brakes and rotors, and agreed with us that the tires should be replaced.  We were told they would fix the oil leaks, but would not do anything about the brakes or tires.  Mind you, the oil leaks will be covered under warranty.  So, no skin off there back.  We returned the vehicle.

Adding insult to injury, at no time did we receive any customer service and/or did anyone try to keep us as satisfied customer.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Researched 17 BMW dealers in three states. No one came close to price and ability to get the hard to find X5 we were looking for. Lilly Rodriguez worked wonderfully to obtain the vehicle and price that we wanted. Go see her!!!!</review>

We always got the best service, this time was the absolute worst experience, it was almost comical.

I received a recall notification for an air bag problem on my X5, called to make an appointment and was informed the parts would be in the following week and to bring in my car.  The technician, Robert, seemed annoyed that I did not wait until I received a second letter to come in.

He stated that the car would be ready by 4, I called at 5 to advise him that I was picking up the car, he told me the part never made it so nothing was done.  I was upset that my car just sat there all day, I had a meeting in Ventura that evening.

I went to pick up my car the next day, the receptionist told me it was getting washed.  I asked  her to forget washing the car I needed to get to work.  She then tells me they lost my key the day before.  I called my husband to bring me the spare key and told her I needed the technician  to call me.  When I didn't hear from him by the end of the day I called, they transferred me to a fellow named Mike, I asked him for the service manager and he kept repeating this is service, but would not identify himself as the manager.  He finally did, I explained what happened, he simply said he would order a key that could take 3-4 days???? Worst experience at that Valencia Dealership I have ever had in 10 years!</text>< Pictures>

think twice before taking your cars there for services. A few things, basic one first. BMW trained technician installed my cabin air filter with air flow direction reversed. more serious stuff, claimed courtesy check for every service, but didn't see transmission fluid leak, which is very obvious when doing oil change. it's literally just right next to the oil drain plug. Even worst, they might have intentionally loosen the transmission oil pan bolts slightly, so it will leak later on.< /Text>

You will not find better customer service.  Mike and Robert are amazing! They got me into the car I wanted at a great price. They even had the car delivered to my home, where the technician spent almost an hour going over all the features..I got mine fully loaded so it is the epitome of a luxury sport car.  I couldn't ask for more, I love my BMW!! Thank you!<//review>

<Review>Robert Perez, Gabby, and the entire crew did a fantastic job servicing our X5 while making it very convenient for us which we really appreciate. While I hope we don"t have to see them too often it's comforting to know how well they treat their customers. Thank you.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I purchased my first electric vehicle from this dealer which was a 2013, Fiat 500e. I had a brand new 2013 Fiat a couple of years ago, which I really enjoyed but I just needed a larger car and traded it in for a Mini Cooper Countryman. I decided I wanted to save money so I purchased a second car to drive back and forth to work. When I walked into the dealership is greeted by Sergik who is contacting me by email answering all my questions promptly. He introduced me to a Salesman to show me the vehicle. The salesman was very knowledgeable answered all my questions the car was clean just like in the photo. It was late in the evening and I wasn't expecting to take a test drive because they were getting ready to close and I just wanted to look at the car real quick is very excited about it. I was going to come back the next day but they were not worried about the time and encouraged me to take a test drive if I wanted to do it then. The test drive went well and I came back the next day and purchase the vehicle. The vehicle was fully charged and clean. It was New Year's Eve so the dealership was very busy with several customers, but the atmosphere was so enjoyable I wasn't in a rush to leave they had appetizers food even a band because it was New Year's Eve day. All the sales people were nice and friendly. I can't say enough about how great this dealership was. I would recommend it to anyone that wants a BMW or any used vehicle for that matter. I was so impressed I went to the dealership manager and complimented him on his staff.<//Review><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
To me Valencia BMW's Service department continues to be a 5-Star service location.   We've owned 5 BMWs in the past 12 years and all but one have been serviced at Valencia BMW and in that time, I've never had one concern about whether or not my vehicle was being treated with anything but the best care possible.  So I will say it again - BMW is a rather expensive car upfront, so how do they differentiate themselves, my having high quality and courteous service after the sale - if you want that, head over to Valencia BMW.</Review>

Our purchase experience at Valencia BMW was fantastic!  Robert Grass was straightforward, honest, patient and delivered on everything promised.  We placed a factory order and he imparted his knowledge of the process to us very clearly from beginning to end.  His many years of experience helped to make the transaction a pleasure!  We highly recommend him.</Text>

His response time and overall professionalism was great. I highly recommend working with Nathan he makes the whole car buying business easy and smooth.< /Text>

The quick summary - I believed I could trust BMW and this trust was passed to the body shop the dealer sent my car for repair.  BIG MISTAKE.  The shop was a delight to work with until my car was determined a total-loss.  After discussing with my attorney, I am filing a complaint to the board for several violations including:
1. Charging unauthorized fake or inflated fees  (they say I gave authorization on the phone but NO charges were discussed) which my insurance will only pay a very small portion of given they are "just a tactic to get paid since they will not be doing repairs
2. Charging a 'storage fee' for the days BEFORE the car was found to be a total-loss.  (They are not a storage yard and charging 'storage' while they are still working on the car isn't legal.
3. Refusing to give an itemized account of charges
4. Charging towing without authorization from me (I wasn't even aware)

While everyone at BMW has always been nice to work with, I would go out of my way to avoid a business which passes their customers to such predatory and illegal practices.
An accident, especially a serious one, is stressful (at best).  When my insurance wanted me to use their body shop I was insistent my brand new X2 went to BMW.  In the end, my attorney tells me I would have been better off with the other shop.<//Text>

Cain't say enough about the service. Darin Ellis takes the time to walk  me through all aspects of the service and addresses any questions I have regarding necessary repairs and also presents me with options on elective work.He follows thru with  my service appointment keeping me updated as to problem or complete times.

I recently purchased a 328i. I feel like I received a decent deal on the vehicle, and it drives really nicely. The salesmen were also pretty great during the sales process. However, I am providing 3 stars due to communication. I purchased the car at night, and was told I could bring the car in for buffing. Scheduling this was a pain and I felt at one point I was getting the run-around (one salesman made a complete misrepresentation). Had it not been for Tony, I would have probably given up on trying based on the fact I was essentially told a mis-truth by another rep.  I recently realized that the car lacked interior mats. I followed up regarding this about a week ago and NO ONE has bothered to respond. I am very particular when it comes to the cleanliness of my vehicle, so this small thing, is actually quite important. I have had this car for about three weeks, and I enjoy the car, but the lack of communication is very concerning.<//text>

<review>Customer service is awesome.  They are professionals especially Bryan Hough who took care of all the scheduled maintenance required for my 2015 X5.  My clock was acting up so he suggested that I leave my car overnight to work on my car's computer system. He also gave me a new 2016, 3 series loaner so I won't be inconvenienced.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I had the pleasure of ordering my BMW with Gregg Nagel. He's the best salesman I've ever encountered. True professional, polite, courteous and responds quickly to my questions. I would recommend anyone looking to purchase a BMW with Gregg. Definitely coming back to Valencia BMW for my next vehicle.<//Review>

I've had my car a week and am loving it.
Nathan L was fabulous. He was helpful, patient and believe it or not was able to answer all my questions and concerns.
Dominic the GENIUS was wonderful. He was accommodating, patient and knowledgable.
Working with Valencia BMW has been an good experience considering how much I dread car buying. Thanks for being exceptional.< /text>

I initially purchased a used 3 series, but decided that the vehicle was not right for me and I returned it. The entire staff was amazing and treated me no differently than if I was there to buy a high end sports car. I ended up purchasing a new 328i (which I love), and the process was easy and comfortable. No pressure, very professional. I love this dealership and look forward to having my new car serviced there.< /Review>

<text>I am extremely satisfied with the service and car I got from Valencia BMW. Martin Dino was very helpful and worked with me to get me into my 5 series at a price I was happy to pay.

<review>The entire crew at Valencia BMW was professional, friendly and went out of their way to treat me like a VIP. My salesman Tony Bennett handled every detail even as he was leaving on vacation and when I had a minor issue with the key fob, the service department wasted no time helping me get a replacement.

I recommend Valencia BMW... it was definitely worth driving the extra miles!</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Richie at Valencia BMW is the best! I too like everyone dreaded the car buying experience... but from the moment that I walked in the doors I was at ease, everyone was so kind and easy going... This was the absolute best car buying experience. I was in and out in less than 2 hours with my BEAUTIFUL new car. They just asked me what I wanted to pay monthly and what I had as a deposit... My deal was approved as I had requested and I was in n' out in a flash! I highly recommend anyone considering buying a BMW to visit this dealership. I'll never go anywhere else! Thanks Everyone!</Text>< Pictures>

I just leased my second BMW from Valencia BMW and the service was once again exceptional. I live in San Diego and choose to work with Lynn at Valencia BMW over my local dealers because she doesn't just try to sell you a car, she wants the BMW to be exactly what you want. I have been very satisfied with the initial and continuous service that I receive from Valencia BMW and would recommend them to anyone.< /Review>

Lance Chavez is one of the best I have had the privilege of working with!  He was open to hearing my thoughts and answering questions, was willing to take any proposal I had from a financing perspective to his managers, and was genuinely pleasant to work with.  I love Valencia BMW, I've now purchased two cars there and I would not go anywhere else for my BMW needs.< /Review>

As a young woman, being treated in a condescending manner or being dismissed is something that I've become accustomed to in the auto world. Luckily there are still dealerships out there like Valencia BMW! Not only did they get me a dreamy car with a killer deal, but they made me feel respected and made sure I was properly informed on every decision and step of the process. Julius in particular is a wonderful help! I would definitely recommend this dealership, and everyone there.</Review>

<Review>I had smoking coming out of my exhaust each morning when I started my 2012 BMW 528i. Service Adviser Cole seemed to suspect the problem to be a clogged oil feed line. That if it was it would be covered under extended warranty for that part. Well he was right. Next day my car was ready. The following morning when I started it- - no smoke. Service was great and Cole is fantastic. I have been going to Valencia BMW for 20 years. Very happy with the service. Edward< /Review>< Pics>

Christopher at BMW was great , he was on time for my appointment, he answered all of my questions, and when my car was ready he called me and asked if I was ready for a pick up to bring me back to my car. Everyone else was very good with the customer service also. They even washed my car, which looked better then when I bring it to the car wash. I'm looking forward to my next maintenance appointment.

I was upside down in my Honda Accord lease and I was very limited on what I could do in order to get out of it without spending a fortune. Honda wanted an arm and a leg to get into a new accord. Thank God I was able to get in touch with Lance Chavez over at BMW Valencia. Lance was extremely transparent in the buying process and provided the numbers before I even arrived at the delearship. When I got to the dealers it took about an hour and a half to complete the process. I was able to get into a 330i lease for cheaper then I would an accord, and my credit isn’t all that! Lol. Seriously give BMW  Valencia a chance and try to get in contact with Lance, he’s a terrific person.</review>

<Text>Lillian and Valencia BMW made my car buying experience smooth, pleasant, and very convenient. The car buying experience has always brought a feeling of uneasiness and apprehension. But Lillian was responsive, prompt, and courteous, and Valencia BMW's home delivery service made the experience extremely convenient. Definitely no feelings of uneasiness. I had been searching a long time for the right CPO 6 series, and I'm glad I purchased from Valencia BMW.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I have leased two cars from Valencia BMW this year and I couldn't be more satisfied. Lillian took care of me and worked extremely hard to accommodate my budget, while putting me in the car I want. Other sales people just suggest cheaper cars. She is also super attentive and communicates very well. I highly recommend Valencia BMW and I especially recommend Lillian. She is a superstar.</Text></record>

Worst experience at any BMW service center I have ever encountered. Not only is the issue not fixed in my car (fuel sensor), my car was vandalized while in for service. Someone attempted to steal the license plate and was unsuccessful. The plate is bent, bolts missing, and it appears as though the mount may also be damaged beyond repair. I'm working with local law enforcement regarding the issue. At this time a resolution has not be reached.

Now let's talk about Brian Hough. He has decided to take it upon himself to document on my service notes that tire damage (feathering) is noted on the inspection and that we declined services for the issue. I can tell you that my husband nor I was ever told of this issue and would NEVER decline this repair. I drive many interstate miles weekly and we are very aware of the need to maintain the car's safety. In fact, I have already reached out to another BMW service center to order the tires and to the alignment ASAP.

So after charging me nearly $700 in labor costs, the original issue is still not fixed, Brian lied on the inspection paperwork which put my safety at risk, and my car has damage from a theft attempt of the license plate. This is a nightmare.<//text>

The answer is Polo Lopez.   No one makes this grueling experience easier.  He's personal, professional and gets the job done.   I don't think there anyone better at their job - and he enjoys it!!!</Text>

I have purchased 4 cars from Valencia BMW and Robert Grass is the main reason I keep coming back.  Robert is extremely knowledgable and professional and always puts his clients first.  He is really an advocate for his clients and fights to make sure he is putting together the best deal possible, whether negotiating with the big banks to get the most favorable rate or finding the car that best suits the needs of his client.  Robert is exceptional at explaining all aspects of the deal and answering questions.  He is a hard worker, a great listener, and is always considerate of my time.  I would highly recommend Valencia BMW and Robert Grass.<//Review>

Horrible place to buy or get your car serviced. Service department is a nightmare.  Much better off going to some other dealership. Took my car for service, and drove back with additional damages to the car. Tried getting help from service manager, general manager no one returns the calls. Finally going to file a claim in Small Claims Court.

Initially left a review after bad experience, spoke to the GM and this issue was resolved. Increasing my rating from 1 star to 4 stars for resolving the issue.</review>

<Time>1557775011175< /Time><review>My experience with BMW was underwhelming at best.  My 2018 X5 broke down 60 miles from Valencia. I had to get the SUV towed to the dealership. I contacted the dealership, because I knew that I would not arrive by the time the service department closed. My goal was to pick up a loaner because BMW emergency roadside said that the car needed extensive work.  The front desk person, was useless.  She could not get a service person to talk to me, she said I would have to deal with it in the morning. I explained that i live 45 miles from the dealership.  She said she could not help me.

I woke up the next morning to see that I had received no messages from the service department.  I left my keys overnight, it is a bit disconcerting that there was no acknowledgement that they had my car and were reviewing the car.  I had to leave a few messages until my service rep called me back.  He said that my car needed a new fuel pump (a bummer for a one year old car) and that i would have to leave it for a week. He said that I had to come back to the dealer in order to get a loaner.  And the kicker, I would have to pay for the uber.

Finally, my car was ready.  I called ahead (remember I had 45 miles to drive) and asked if my SUV would be ready to go.  The same front desk person as before, said she would.  And, of course it was not ready and it was dirty.  They had to wash it, which took another 20 minutes.

I am leaving out having to call multiple times for updates etc... I will say that my car is now running. That is important.

In summary, you should have a game plan for cars delivered after service hours. You can coordinate with sales to have a loaner available.  Or, be willing to cover the cost of an uber ride back to the dealership.  If someone leaves a car overnight, have the assigned service person call or text first thing in the morning.    Finally, if someone asks for your car to be ready when you get there, then act accordingly.

BMW emergency roadside was not helpful either. They would only tow me to Valencia, they would not tow me to Santa Monica. They said i could pay what would equal $250.00.  At the time I assumed Valencia would allow me to rent a car locally.  I did not expect to have to drive bck there.

Overall, the repairman did his job, the rest did not.</review></record>

He responded to our calls regarding installation of a Lo-jack on our new vehicle. We will recommend Mack S to our friends and look forward to doing business with Mack S in the future.

I was driving from  San Diego to San Francisco. My car started acting up and the engine light came on when on the 5 freeway in Valencia. I was lucky enough to be close to Valencia BMW.  I was worried what could be wrong with my X4, Vanessa in Service was my advisor, she took great car of me and my car. Turns out, it was my ignition coil after 2 hours I was back on the road to San Francisco. Thank you Vanessa G.<//text>

I had an excellent experience here, Lewis Cureton was very informative and made the process very simple. He was not pushy and offered us a variety of options to aid in our decision. Thoroughly happy with the purchase on 9/18/16< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>WHAT A GREAT DEALERSHIP!!!   WILLIE DALGAN WAS THE SALESMAN THAT ASSISTED ME IN THE SUCCESSFUL PURCHASE OF MY VEHICLE.  HE  WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL, EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE BASED ON THE MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND HIS HIGH LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IN THE CAR BUSINESS.  WHAT WAS SO SPECIAL ABOUT HIM WAS THAT HE ADDED THE HUMAN ASPECT TO HIS APPROACH.  HE WAS NOT PUSHY AT ALL.  HE TOOK TIME TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO ME, GAVE ME OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM, WAS VERY PATIENT, CARING & KIND.   I ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE SALES MANAGER MIKE MURRAY WHO WAS ALSO JUST AS NICE, CARING AND CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY WERE ABLE TO MEET MY EXPECTATIONS AND HELPED TO FACILITATE A VERY SMOOTH PROCESS.  I MUST SAY THEY BOTH WENT THE "EXTRA MILE" IN MAKING EVERYTHING HAPPEN SO QUICKLY AND SMOOTHLY.  BOTTOM LINE, I'M A VERY, VERY HAPPY & SATISFIED CUSTOMER.  I WILL DEFINITELY BE A REPEAT CUSTOMER & WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP TO ALL OF MY FAMILY & FRIENDS.</Text>< pictures>

Went in to get a low beam bulb replaced.  Jesse Colon checked me in.  He claimed to not know what the bulb would cost.  Interesting considering he had a computer at his finger tips.  I knew the bulb was expensive being I priced it at O'reilly auto parts store for $100.00  When it was all said and done, with labor it came to $380.00.  Jesse claimed to be shocked that the bulb cost over $200.  He then told me a he was able to get me a deal at wholesale bringing it down to $180.00.  It goes without saying I felt completely hustled out of my cash.  My 328i has over 100 grand on it.  As I start to think about replacing it BMW is no longer in my plans.</text>

This dealership was top notch! Mr. Craig Geyer went above and beyond to make sure I purchased the car I was most comfortable with. He gave me suggestions, advice and was never pushy. The process was easy and professional. Would highly recommend his expertise to anyone in the market for a vehicle.<//review>

Not the place to buy a used car. Offered a deal and I accepted.  Was told they would have the car in 1-2 days. After calling I was told car was not available yet by the 2nd day being told the same thing . They blamed the towing company! I walked away.
I’ll try another dealership< /Review>

< review>
The sales person, Nick was outstanding.  Allowed us to test drive the same car a few times, and was utterly patient and helpful.  The finance person, however, was extremely friendly until he realized that I was not interested in the extended warranty.  He then proceeded to question me about why I didn't want it.  When that wasn't successful in changing my mind, he began to tell me how the X6's are often in the shop, asked if I knew how much a repair on an X6 costs, etc.  He almost talked me out of buying the car.  I told him that he was making me nervous about buying the car, and he stopped.  However, within a fem minutes, began questioning me again.  This is probably the 8th vehicle I have purchased over my lifetime and I have never been treated this way.</review>

By far the best overall car buying experience in my almost 30 years of car purchasing!  It was an absolute pleasure working with Lewis Cureton as he helped me get the car I wanted, at the price I wanted and for that I am thankful and pleased with my purchase.

Overall, all personnel I've encountered at the dealership are by far true and consummate professionals, which is a great reflection of the leadership there and keeping with BMW's overall goal of customer satisfaction.<//Text>

<text>Came in for warning light and power steering noise.  Found out car needed fluids and tune up.  Under the maintenance warranty on the CPO it was $50.  Car was serviced, washed and back to us within five hours.  Darin was super friendly and informative.  When the issue of new tires came up he didn't try to sell me new ones, rather understood we couldn't do it for a few weeks and only offered help not a fast sale.< /text>< pictures>

AutoNation at Valencia BMW was easy to do business with when I shopped for a 330i. The no haggle price for a 330i was posted on the web site for and was reasonable among the dealers that had similar car in the inventory. The car was reserved for 3 days giving me the time to plan the trip to the dealer (I flew in from the Bay Area). When I arrived, the car was cleaned and ready for delivery.  Recommend Valencia BMW and AutoNation.< /review>

This is the place to buy or lease your next BMW.. look no more . I called Lilly , she answered my questions , found me the car I wanted & quoted my price all within a very professional & efficient time.  I even didn't try to negotiate the price as I had a previous price given to me from a dealer I leased 2 cars before thinking I'll get the best deal as a return customer. Lilly gave me a price I couldn't resist & I had to drive longer but definitely was worth it . No hassle or sales pressure. People are very nice, professional & helpful. Even more she drove the car to my office when it was ready. Please, call Lilly & enjoy Valencia BMW. Thank you for a great experience. That was a truly painless & pleasant one. Definitely, I'll be back.</text>

Nathan L. and Sean from Valencia BMW went above and beyond to help me get into a white 2 series, which caught my eye with red leather interior.  Nathan made the experience very pleasing and he has a customer for life.  Thank you again Nathan and Sean.<//text>

I was recommended by a friend to Robert Grass for the i3  he was conscious of my budget and was very helpful with all the information I wanted. When I went to get the car he was attentive and he had someone give me a tutorial on all the new technology in the car. I would recommend him to any of my family or friends. They've already followed up with me to send a genius member to Santa Monica to give me more tips on the car. :)<//Review>

The work done on the car is always great, but communication problems do exist between the different departments. I continuously receive contradicting information regarding service info from people in the service department, sales department, and check-in desk. i wish BMW Valencia would work on that problem</review>

I called in to see if a vehicle was still available, I spoke to Lily Rodriquez and she was the most helpful person I spoke to at a BMW dealer that day.  I called 3 different ones. She broke down everything for me, I live a little over an hour away so she worked everything up for me. I drove down there the next day and bought the car. Thank you very much Lily!!! Matt<//text>

Hello,
Pete and I would like to take this opportunity in commending your employee,
Salesperson Willie, at your dealership. Pete was interested in a 2004 Corvette and dealt directly with Willie. Willie has gone beyond his job in assisting Peter with this purchase. The total experience with Willie was professional, seamless, and truly a great purchasing experience. Pete and I were pleasantly surprised by his hospitality. We are greatly satisfied with the experience and with the purchase.

Willie has exceeded our expectations in customer service with follow-up calls, and other  requests.

Please extend our sincere appreciation of a job well done to Willie! Our experience will greatly influence our future car purchases with your dealership.

Sincerely,
Peter and Rebecca Mendoza
New 2004 Z06 Black Corvette Owners!!!!!</text>

Robert started out as a good service advisor.  Then we had a major problem that he didn't help us with so they gave us a new advisor.  The next time we came in, they asked who our advisor was and we said "Robert".  He refused to help us.  He was there and kept avoiding us.  We waited about 45 minutes and then the 2nd advisor that helped us told us he was mad that we went through someone else for the big job that he didn't help us with.  Horrible customer service from Robert.</text>

Excellent experience with sales rep. Provided me with an out the door cost upon request. Minimized my purchase turnaround reasonable quickly. Everything was great until you go to "finance" for document signing. Finance tries marks up the price with with additional perks and keeps pestering you when you refuse. That made it a negative experience. I have had vehicles delivered to me in the past without the hassle, so anyone can have you sign documents. Recommend Closing the deal with a delivery to your home and just deal with the sale guys. 4 stars for him, One star for Finance Department.</text>

<text>I just had the pleasure of leasing my new BMW at Valencia BMW.  I must admit I was reluctant to go, fearing I would be bombarded by salesmen.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised when I was introduced to Mike and Willie.  Willie not only got me what I wanted exactly, he did so in a no pressure manner and was a pleasure to do business with!  He made sure I understood exactly what I was getting and wouldn't rest until I was taken care of.  Hats off to Willie, Mike and the whole crew for getting me my dream white BMW 328i and forever changing my car buying experience.

Working with Robert Grass was the best buying experience I have ever had.  He is extremely knowledgeable and efficient.  I am very happy with my purchase and experience.  As long as Robert is at Valencia BMW, I will be driving a BMW!</review>

My experience at this dealer started of well; however, it did not take long for it to get ruined. My service advisor Vanessa has been great the few times I've gone in, but the parts Manager Polo, really found a way to ruin that experience. Not only did he dodge all my calls and not return a single phone call even after I left messages to his direct line and I even asked a message to be relayed to him but never heard from him. I ended up going to the dealer; instead of him coming to talk to me directly, he had the lovely lady working on my car working as a messenger as well. You can do better Valencia BMW. All your other employees are great with that one exception.< /review>

I'll start by saying that I absolutely LOVE my car but the best part of my purchase experience with BMW of Valencia is the outstanding customer service they provided from the moment I called their dealership! The Sales Rep (Nate) was amazing in his approach to getting me the car I desired. The Manager personally greeted me and worked with the Finance manager to provide me the best financial agreement. I live more than 2 hours away from this dealer, with several BMW dealers local to me but Valencia BMW is more than worth the drive for the great service I received !<//Text>

It was an absolute pleasure dealing with Graeme Chapman, the manager for internet sales at Valencia BMW.  I was looking to replace my 650i coupe with a 650i Gran coupe.  There were no high pressure sales tactics.  Instead there was a transparent process and smooth negotiations leading to a fair price and terms that made sense to both parties.  Graeme is very professional, knowledgeable and a gentleman in his dealings. He also very helpful with all my needs at the dealership subsequent to the purchase. I would definitely go back to him for my next car if he is still around.< /review>

Got exactly the car I wanted for the best lease payment by far when comparing with other BMW dealerships. This was the second time I leased a BMW from Valencia BMW and both times the experience was fast and easy. My sales representative was Misha and I highly recommend working with him. He spent 2 hours under the hot sun while wearing a suit to physically find the exact car I located online and verified the VIN himself, before I drove over there instead of waiting for the porters. When I got there most of the other sales reps didn't even know that car existed! Love the car... love the dealership!< /text>

This is my first BMW, and it was first new car purchase.  I was a bit intimidated by the whole process until I arrived at Valencia BMW.  Brandon Barsh not only made me feel comfortable, he listened to what my needs were, and he presented the perfect car.  In fact, I ended up choosing the X1, which is a car I had never even considered prior to my visit.  The car is fantastic, and I appreciated Brandon taking the time to go through all the car's functions before I left the dealer.  I also had an opportunity to work with the sales manager, Carlos Dominguez, and he too was so kind and accommodating.  I had my two young children with me, so I know we were a lot to handle, but everyone was knowledgeable, respectful, and patient.< /Text>

Moments that we’re positive:
Was given a loaner car
The gentleman (Robert) who processed my car was nice

Moments that we’re not so positive:
Seen after my appointment time
Was called to pick up car but when arrived it wasn’t ready
Waited for about 30 mins or more before someone told me my car hadn’t been washed and it would take a while before that would happen.
Car didn’t get washed
No one explained what was done to my car or how everything looked, heck one of the papers I got were completely blank!

So far my experiences with BMW haven’t been the greatest. I’ve had better experiences at Honda... pretty surprised to say that, but it’s true!< /review>

I was going to use my 325CI Convertible for a young lady that has been fighting cancer, her father is deployed over seas and graduates on the following day. I explained that the top that morning would not go down and if they could help me fulfill the high school wish. The service tech would not even look at the car. I took it to a BMW garage and they took only half hour to connect a wire fulfilling a high school want to make her graduation a memorable one. Surprising her with her father riding on the car with her.  Valencia BMW you disappointed me.</Review>

Valencia BMW has a great team of people. Professional, courteous and easy to do business with. I live in thousand Oaks but bought 2 cars from Valencia BMW over the phone. The cars were delivered next day. Their price is RIGHT and service is awesome.
I would not buy a BMW from anyone else. Priscilla and Gregg Hamilt, great team. Thank you.<//Review>

<Text>I give 5 stars for the dealer and my salesman Travis Fetterolft. I sent my Build-Your-Own to 5 dealers and Travis was the first one to contact me with a quote for the new car and my trade-in. Other dealers didn't want to bother considering my trade-in. Travis and the dealer earned my business with prompt response and willingness to accommodate my unconventional requests. I had to wait about 4 months for my 2018 230i but the whole process was effortless and pleasant. After a week of driving it a BMW genius, Madison Louise came to my house and went over iDrive and control buttons. she was very patient and respectful.
Highly recommend this dealer!</Text><GmapID>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881<//GmapID><time>1509338091102</time><rating>5< /rating>< Pics>

< Review>
I bought a 740i on Wednesday, 07-13-16. My sales person was Willie Dalgan. He was knowledgeable and courteous. He answered all my questions and did his best to meet my demands and make me happy. The financial staff was very nice and helpful, also. The only drawback was it took a while to get to sign the paperwork, but they did not have enough staff, and it was beyond their control.

Willie made a follow up call the next day to see if everything was going good. It was nice to do a business with good people.<//Review>

This review is for the service.

Service is great here when your car is under warranty. However, when you need repairs they will overcharge you. They were charging me $1000 to replace the front brakes on my car which was ridiculous. I can have it replaced elsewhere for less than half that amount. Never again, I will take my car here for repairs unless it's a recall service.< /text>

<Review>Don't be fooled you can get the same deal on any BMW no matter where you go. Every dealer in the country will match any offer and in most cases do a dealer swap for the same exact car you're looking at. What makes a "good" dealership is how they treat you after they take your money. That's where Valencia BMW is terrible and why - in their own words- you should go somewhere else.

When leased my car, I was sold on how impressive the service dept at Valencia BMW you was. I was guaranteed flat bed pick up to my home or office wherever, a loaner car whatever I needed all I had to do was call and schedule the service.

I have been trying now for 3 weeks to schedule the regular service for my car and it's been a nightmare. When I originally called my car was approaching service, when I finally gave up it was  past due for service.  I have tried no less then 6 times to schedule pickup and drop off only to encounter excuse and obstacle after excuse and obstacle.  I have left messages for service managers not once to get a call back.  adding insult to injury the service staff here has ventured beyond rude to just poor taste, specifically a young lady named Jasmine, who I've had the distinct pleasure of speaking to at least 4 times, suggesting  "I can feel free to go somewhere else" if I was unsatisfied with their service department.

I was refereed to Valencia BMW by a family member who has bought multiple cars from the team here, I personally have sent 4 friends to the sales rep i worked with.  However, I finally took Jasmines advice and took my business somewhere else.

Yesterday I called Gil at Century West BMW He had me in and out in a few minutes and even dropped me off at my office.  I got my car back within a couple hours, while it was there they must have detailed it because it was SPOTLESS as if it where a brand new car.  Don't waste your time with Valencia BMW, all they care about is the sale and getting your money as soon as you sign paperwork all bets are off, you're on your own.<//Review>< response>

<Text>This is the best place to buy nice cars and they have the best deals. I'm so glad I got my car from here. Whenever I went to other BMW companies, they didn't have many options or good deals. Also, they weren't very friendly. However, at Valencia BMW, everyone is very friendly. I felt very welcomed:) Also, my Dad bought a few cars from Willie Dalgan and we always deal with him for our car needs. I would really recommend Valencia BMW to whoever is interested in a BMW!!!</Text>< UserId.>

I recently purchased a 4 series coupe, and my rating is based on the experience that I had with my sales associate Shannon B. She was attentive helpful and patient with me as I waded through the endless choices, features, and options that I could have on any particular make or model.

She was great, and I recommend her to assist you in your future car hunting experiences.< /text>

<review>I recently started looking for a medium size nice vehicle. I sent requests for quotes to several dealerships.  The first to respond was Travis Fetterolf from Valencia BMW.  He asked me a few questions and was able to provide me with a firm quotation on a model I was very happy with. A few days later I drove off Valencia BMW with the greatest car buying experience I ever had. if you are serious about buying a vehicle give a call to Travis. Honestly BMW was never my choice but from now on I am a BMW fan. I am extremely happy with my 535i. In fact by brother-in-law bought another one the very next week from Travis.<//review>< Pictures>

The poor people at Valencia BMW. They were awesome. Gave them my budget. I would pay cash only, the salesman worked late that night, as he tried to find me a used vehicle I would be happy in. After strenuous negotiations... I got my baby. Mr. Mazen was the best, not pushy which I would not have dealt well with I went over several cars. After I got the car it doesn't  end there, first it was sent in for inspection/maintenance,  wash/wax they called me and set up an appointment with the BMW GENIUS who would help me get the most out of my car. This should be mandatory. Side note I could not forget, Mr. Mazen when it was time for me to pick up my car sent his son to come get me. Talk about a personal touch. And the son... absolute gentleman.
This was not the first dealership I went to, but may be my last. Nothing but class. Thank you Valencia BMW, See you soon.< /text>

We just brought a new 528i from Brandon Barsh at Valencia BMW and we could not be happier. There professionalism and knowledge are simply, the best. This is the second car we have purchased from them.

From their top notch service department to there management, you will not find a better experience when purchasing or servicing your BMW.

<text>I wish I could give it 0 stars for how I've been treated here.
They act nice and courteous when im there ready to buy , but as soon as I left I soon realized I was just another number and they could care less about what happens to me or my car. I was always skeptical of AutoNation but decided to give it a try, especially with their support in Breast Cancer. One of my friends who had Breast Cancer reccomended them.
I bought a car there on a rainy day and my Salesman didn't even give me a tour of the car or go through the checklist to confirm everything was good. They just wanted to go home since it was Friday evening. I drove an hour for this. Once I got home I realized that even though I cleaned my car it still seemed dirty. When I took a closer lool I had realized that my windshield was completely full of cracks. It was completely pitted. I took it to two different Dealerships to get secondary opinions and they explained to me that it needed to be fixed asap because the amount of little cracks could be dangerous. They quoted me for over $1,000 to fix. Now, imagine having just a bought a car and days later already getting quoted another $1000. I reach out to several people at BMW Valencia and they decide to play the game of "let me transfer you" to no one answering. Then, Everytime I called, the floor manager wasnt there. Then I finally got in touch with Mr. Polo. The director of that region I think. When I first emailed him it went smooth. After that, it took him a werk before realizing he never replied to me and when he did he mentioned he couldn't do anything about it saying it past inspection. I have the paperwork to prove their promise to me was a windshield free of "damage or cracks" with a check mark. An entirely pitted windshield that bothers my view while driving is not free of cracks or damage. Which should be fraud. They sold me on a car with this damage. I have continued to email Mr. Polo but seem to get ignored, which seems to be common at this dealership. From my experience, once they got my money, no one cared about whether or not I got screwed over. Luckily I realized how they operated before my wife and Mother bought their cars there. I would HIGHLY reccomend going elsewhere as you'll have peace of mind that this wont happen to you. I am not comfortable in my car and my windshield is damaged. I hope no one else has to go through this. My friend that has Breast Cancer is embarrassed for this but its not her fault. Shame on this dealership for treating a client this way.</text>< pics>

<Review>Robert Grass was incredibly helpful, he worked diligently with me to make sure that I was getting exactly the kind of car with features all within my budget. He did not have to help me with my lease return at MB, however he went above and beyond to make sure that I had all resources available to make it a smooth process. Manny in Finance did a wonderful job and made the closing stage of the buying process a wonderful and easy-going experience for me, as well. This is my 4th lease so I know how difficult it can be to have a peaceful experience without a reputable sales team. Thank you Robert, Manny and the rest of the BMW team of Valencia, I love my new car!</Review>< username>

<review>Working with Nathan was a good experience.  He worked hard to find me the car I was looking for and did not try to force some other car on me that I did not want like some other dealers.  He gave me what I wanted at a great price.  I would refer people back to him.< /review>< Pics>

I recently purchased a 335i from Buck a BMW of Valencia, to replace the 328i that I bought from Buck, also! I received the same great service and attentiveness from Buck, but beyond that, he treated me like I was a part of his own family.

I just leased a 228i BMW from Valencia BMW and I'm absolutely in love with it!

I was unsure at first what kind of car I wanted and was going to spend the day  looking at different cars around the area  so I started with BMW. The salesman Mazen Gharzeddine came directly to me to assist me and get a feeling of what I was looking for and what kind of budget I had.  After showing me two very good offers and after getting to know me a little bit he knew exactly the car for me. He took me into the show room where they had a managers special  and it was absolutely the perfect car for me,  I had no need to look further .
I highly recommend Valencia BMW to anyone who is looking for a good deal and some personalized customer service.< /Text>

Took 1hr 45min for an oil change WITH an appointment! Then when I got back to the dealership, they informed me it would be another 1hr+ for the car wash. Seriously? If I didn't already pre-pay for these oil changes, I would not come back to this place...< /Text>

Booked a service appointment, the technician confirmed that my service can be done in one hour. Showed up next day, waited 40 mins before I was able to speak to someone, just to find out that they can only deal with my car in 3-4 hours. Terrible service.< /text>

The salesperson who I dealt with was very professional, as was her sales manager. My issue is the condition of the car when it was delivered. The interior was not detailed properly as I was told it was. The floor mats were filthy. So filthy that I shampooed them myself. There was dirt on the carpeting as well. Ryan, the sales manager, offered to reimburse me if I wanted to have the car detailed again,which was a good gesture. In short we love the car but someone at the dealership needs to take a hard look at the manager of their detail department.<//text>

<review>I worked with a friend, Oren Weintraub of Authority Auto, who helps make deals with different auto groups. He worked a deal with Valencia BMW for a hot 2016 Alpine White M4. He negotiated with Robert Grass. All arrangements were set up prior to me arriving. Valencia BMW prepped my car for delivery. I went in, all paperwork was completed and car was ready. I was greeted when I arrived. I was then shown my car, followed by a speedy signing of all paperwork. Everything went flawlessly. The BMW genius went over the features of my car. I started my car and drove off!

Quick and painless. BMW NA and Valencia BMW both followed up with me and my experience. I have nothing but good things to say about BMW and my experience at Valencia. I also want to give credit to Oren Weintraub of Authority Auto for making the deal for me.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Had a great experience with Hector Castro, he was upfront and honest from the moment he picked up my phone call.  I live in Orange County and made the drive to Valencia to purchase a 2016 BMW 428i.  Hector made the transaction quick and painless! He was also very knowledgeable and never made it seem like I was bothering him with my thousand questions, (even thru text). He was very professional and got back to me promptly!! I am referring my friends and family to Hector for any future purchases without a doubt!! Valencia BMW, Hector Castro is an asset to your company! Thank you!</review>

<Review>My 9 am appointment was delayed 45 minutes because the service advisor didn’t know I had arrived ( signed in and requested update 3 different times). I have had a parking assist light on for sometime, requested it be checked. The conclusion from the advisor was that “rodents “ had climbed up and chewed the wires. She knew this because it happens quite often at the dealership? The repair would be $600 (14k miles on the car)! The “rodent “ conclusion was confirmed by the Service Manager! This problem seems to be rampant throughout Santa Clarita and happens “frequently at the dealership “ as well. I think BMW needs a put together a “rodent team” and determine why BNW’s are being selected by rodents, I have not heard of any other car companies expressing this problem. I have purchased or leased 5 BMW’s since 2006, no more. Knowing that a service department has your best interests at heart and will not present you with ridiculous charges is important to me, it doesn’t feel that way at Valencia BMW.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Name>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Two words, STAY AWAY. This place is full of scammers, I don't doubt there are good people here, but the fleet manger and a sales representative Denise are the biggest liars, I don't like disgusting people like this and wanted you all to know how they truly do business. I emailed Denise a day in advance of the type of car I want, with my packages I would like, he told me he has the exact model with my specifications, HE EVEN WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO SEND ME THE DETAILS OF THE CAR!... So I show up to this dealership to buy the car I asked for, we looked around a little bit at other models to make sure that's the car we wanted to our family and our new born, I told Denise go ahead and get the car I wanted he told me "it's at another lot probably going to take me 30 minutes to get back, we said okay we will wait here, at about 10-15 minutes he comes with the car. Naturally I come outside to look at it and the specifications, before I sat in this car he says to me "just to let you know it doesn't have one of the packages" he then tried to add I have another car but it won't have premium package". I instantly got mad, I said thanks for wasting my time and started walking out... Then the "fleet manager" helped me, he tried finding a car for me and couldn't find it with the same color so I said color doesn't matter just find the same specs, he then tells me the closest one is in San Francisco and I would have to pay a $500 transportation fee and also wanted to sell the car at a higher car payment on me, he kept saying I'm a "fleet manager" you can't get a better price then me, at this point I was exhausted and just wanted to pay and get out, but my wife said let's just leave... Never in my life have I left a dealership without anyone caring... Manager was there and didn't really help with anything... so far the worst BMW dealership experience I have had. So we left, and where did we go you ask? Van Nuys BMW (Center BMW). Talked to a guy named Allen AND GUESS WHAT THEY HAD THE CAR. Allen and I talked price (guess what, the fleet manager was wrong Allen beat his price BIG TIME) and sealed the deal, great guy.

PLEASE GUYS if you drive a BMW don't go here, unless you want to settle for another car because they won't have the car you want and pay higher monthly payments.</Text>< pictures>

Shortly after they had finished I came out to my car being washed and I thought to my self wow this is nice.
So I left went to closest store And when I tried to lock my car it wasn’t working with the fob or manually
So I went back and told Bob who was my SA
And was plain rude to me and he said it had nothing to with the recall ect and I mentioned well you did disconnect my battery and he said okay I’ll look into it that sometimes key fobs need to be reprogrammed due to the battery being disconnected and had Daniel meza try to program the key
Daniel meza came back literally 2 minutes after and he told me that the tech told him that the system to the locking system wasn’t working but you could hear it trying to work
After I told Daniel we’ll you guys created this issue after disconnecting my battery so I need you to speak to bob about this and fix the issue because my car was locking perfectly fine before you guys even worked on it  he went to speak to bob and I saw them both talking in a corner bob came up to me with the excuse that it had nothing to do with the recall and was plain rude talking over me and handing me my keys basically telling me to get lost.
At this point I was really fed up with what he was saying I even told him that I didn’t need them washing my car to begin with and when I said he gave me the most ridiculous response“ oh maybe washing the car got water in the locking actuators but maybe once it dries it will work but we can’t help you at this point unless you schedule a service appointment” he  basically wanted to pay for a problem they created, all I wanna say is this dealership is the worst when it comes to taking care of their customers
Don’t let me forget to mention that I said “ oh what a coincidence that my locks stopped working after you guys worked on it” Bob responded and said “oh that is a coincidence”

Now I’m out of luck with none working lock actuators because they don’t wanna be accountable for a problem they created and keep in mind once a door lock actuator stops working sometimes the doors don’t open inside or out that’s a safety issue but youl be hearing from BMW Of North America soon.
Never again will I have my car here taken to get serviced or even buy parts from you at all I was even almost dumb enough to even considerer purchasing another Bmw before this happened but there goes that.</Review>< user_name>

<review>I found the car I wanted online at BMW of Valencia.  It was a 2011 Kia Soul, well outfitted.  I contacted the dealership and Kianou helped me through the whole process.  He was very kind and patient.  The test drive was great and it was the car for me.   The dealership was very nice and everyone involved in the  process could not have been more pleasant or helpful.  I am really enjoying my car.  I would recommend Valencia BMW to  anyone for their one on one approach and personal attention.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<review>I don't usually write reviews, but I was actually looking forward to writing this one. Valencia BMW is really outstanding. Seriously, these guys are absolutely great!  I am a 'car guy' through and through.  At any time I have 5 or 6 cars, everything from new BMWs to classic muscle cars.  I have bought and sold many cars, and dealt with many dealers.  Valencia BMW is the best experience I have had ever, and that is saying something.  I dealt with Martin Dino in sales, Hamid in finance, and both obviously enjoy what they do, and sincerely want their customers to be happy. Martin and I communicated by text and email over the course of 2 days, talked by phone several times, and at the end of the second day, Martin drove a beautiful new BMW to my house (to my house), so it would be there on my wife's birthday. He had all the paperwork with him and ready to go, we signed it at my dining room table in about 10 minutes, and that was it!  More importantly really, Valencia BMW obviously did everything they could to get the BMW I wanted, at a price and terms I could afford. No games, no highball/lowball nonsense, no tense conversations, no pressure. I actually live quite a ways away from Valencia, but I am going to call Valencia BMW first from now on.  Cars are a big investment, so buying a car can be a little stressful, but these guys make it comfortable and easy.  And while I am sure there are a lot of great people working there (they are obviously working as a team), I do have to say that Martin Dino, in particular, is absolutely terrific to work with.  Go out of your way to buy your cars from Valencia BMW, you will be happy you did.</review>< username>

<Review>I went out of my way this time to keep my sales tax dollars local and purchase a vehicle off the local BMW dealership. This is my eight BMW so I am very familiar with the brand. The salesperson was fair, seemed honest, and appeared sincere. Throughout the sales process, I was notified that the car had specific options and one was the wiring for XM radio. I confirmed with the Genius staff member the XM radio was missing and my salesperson said to contact the service department so they could process the activation. Therefore, made an appointment, sat for 90 minutes to find out that they were going to charge me $1100.00 just to hook up the XM radio. The service staff member was very curious, and understood my frustration and went out of his way to provide quality service. Never did the salesperson tell me that I would have to spend the funds to get XM radio, why would anybody purchase a BMW and spend $1100.00 to hook up a service that is free for a year and less than $10.00 a month. How could BMW not include XM radio and why any salesperson and his manager would, take a positive sales process and turn the entire purchase into a negative experience. I would avoid this dealership now knowing how they operate. If something is not included, why not make it clear and tell them that it is not included and cost a specific amount. I should have known better!

I did call him left voice mail and never heard anything back from the manager.< /Review></record>

<user>109598947896107840199</user><Rate>5<//Rate><pics>None</pics><Time>1496769139925< /Time><Review>After visiting Audi, Mercedes, and Infiniti, and being let down by their outrageous monthly lease payments for their entry-level vehicles, I came here on a whim hoping to get a great deal on a mid-size SUV or crossover. I was not let down! This was my first time leasing a car, and I was bit hesitant and nervous when I walked in the door, but Mack made me feel at ease with the entire process. I have purchased 3 cars in my life, and never have I felt more comfortable with a sales person than I did with Mack. He was kind, humble, and worked with me to get my monthly payments to fit within my budget. And even better, he and didn't pressure me while negotiating my payments. He was cool as a cucumber while I asked to look at multiple vehicles and package options (in 90+ degree heat might I add!). I was torn between the X5 and X6, but after test-driving the X5, I knew she was the one. I told Mack I needed a day to think about things, and he had no problem with it. He even encouraged it. The next day I came back, and told him where I needed the payments to be and he was more than accommodating to my needs (I wanted 12,000 miles/year, and BMW is big on pushing the 10,000 miles/year package.) We agreed on a price that beat the competition (and I got my 12,000 miles!). After signing the papers, I couldn't believe how smooth the process went. The financing add-ons they try to sell you after signing are a little obnoxious and intimidating, but I get it - it's how they make $$ on leases. Needless to say, I'm very happy with my new car and cannot say enough great things about Mack. If you're looking for a new car - whether you're buying or leasing - and don't want a young, pushy salesman who's just looking to score a big commission off you, get in touch with Mack. He'll make you feel at ease and will take all the time you need to get you to a price point you're happy with. I never thought I'd be driving a brand new BMW, but Mack made that possible!< /Review>< name>

<Text>The sales person was very pleasant but knew very little about the all-electric i3. He, in fact, said some things that were just wrong. He had not been working there for long but that is no excuse. The worst experience was from the financial guy who did the paperwork and explained legal stuff. I wanted to find out about the service and warrenty. He completely failed to explain the factory warrenty but spent about a half hour trying to sell me an extended warrenty for nearly $5,000. He made BMW sound like the most unreliable car on the road so I really needed the extended warrenty. I am sure he was on commission.<//Text>< resp>

<review>I had a great experience buying a car with Jim Hiten Advani.  Jim was extremely helpful in answering all of my questions and working with me as a long distance buyer.  He went above and beyond and even helped me outside of normal work hours.  Stan, who delivered the car to me, was also top notch.  He is very kind and addressed all of my concerns.  Stan is also very knowledgeable about all the details and features of the BMW models. I plan on buying my next BMW through these guys because of this experience.

I recently purchased a used BMW from Valenica BMW.  I was very happy with my sales associate as he was very helpful to answering all of my questions and getting the purchase done.  My main reason in writing, however, is to comment on what I experienced with the finance manager.  I have purchased many cars in my life, from several different dealerships, but never have I had such an unpleasant experience signing final paperwork in a finance department as what I underwent at Valencia BMW.  Since it was my first purchase at a luxury car dealership it was especially disappointing as one is expecting another level of service.  Every car purchase involves the offering of add-ons by the dealer but this part of the purchase at Valencia BMW was very different for me.  I totally get that BMWs can potentially be costly to maintain and think it is completely fine that all these protection plans are offered.  Mickey, the finance manager, however, took this to another level with his high pressure tactics and discourteous behavior.  When I declined the offered plans he became downright rude.  All this was totally uncalled for and would make me avoid going to this dealership to purchase another car.< /Text>

<name>J Kou</name><review>I recently leased two BMWs from Valencia BMW. I came to this dealership following a friend's recommendation. As expected, the service provided by Sean Crawford was very satisfactory. He is very efficient and patient, and not pushy. He also helped us to get great leasing terms under BMW's foreign professional program. As we are new to the US, this program is very helpful for us to get the required credit. I am also happy with the service from their finance manager Hamid Osati. I would recommend this dealer for people interested in leasing or purchasing a BMW.</review><gmap_id>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881<//gmap_id>< resp>

<review>When to Valencia BMW . look around at BMW's for more than 30 min . No one came out and greeted me or talk to me. after deciding to go somewhere else we saw a group of 5 and more sales people and they did not bother to help me out.  Sales associates need to learn to talk to every customer that set's foot in the dealer.  Decided to go to BMW of Van Nuys . The car that i wanted was 5 series . white paint black interior.

I recently needed to get a new car because my lease was about to expire. I had been talking to Michael over at Valencia BMW about getting either an M4 or M5. I went out there on a Friday morning and looked at the cars. I really fell in love with the M4 right away. Michael and the other guys at Valencia BMW did a great job. They knew I was kind of in a hurry and the transaction was smooth and flawless. The guys did not waste my time or try to push things upon me I didn't need. I was out of there with a new car in less than 2 hours. I really can't say enough about this dealership. I have recommended them to my brother and rest of my family and they have also purchased cars from here. I drove all the way out from Hermosa Beach to the valley to get the car and I would do it again because I feel the service is that much better than the other dealerships around.</review>

Jamaal Mckenzie was the salesman that took care of me throughout the transaction.  Jamaal was articulate, knowledgeable and a true professional.  A no non-sense approach to car sales, backed by a team of experienced personnel.  If you're in the market for a new or used vehicle, stop by and ask for him by name.

Fabulous customer service from start to finish...called and spoke with Julius Mann- he checked on the vehicle we found on their website, it was in Stock and available- we placed a hold on it, drove to the dealership and there it was already washed and ready. Straight forward with pricing no haggling needed-honest and reasonably priced. Got with Manny Richards in financing and he was great too, helped us get the best financing options possible and overall easy process. Reasons to go to Valencia BMW would be, straight forward business practices- no back and forth games with sales and financing...they answer your questions and call back when they say they will...professional and friendly service. Clean dealership and right on the price! BMW genius staff are also amazing with helping you understand the cool features of your new car.<//Text>

I recently had to get my car towed to Valencia BMW after my engine internally went wrong and needed a brand new engine on my 2013 M3 Limerock Edition.  I have never had a good experience dealing with Valencia BMW after buying the car.

So yesterday I get a call from the service advisor saying my car is ready for pickup and they ran all the test and even drove it around the area, saying everything is running fine. As I turn my car on for the first time the oil level is below minimum. They add a quart of oil and I reset it, drove it around the area to see if it would go away after driving a little, but Same thing shows up. At this point I couldn't drive my car 30 minutes home so I had to go back to the dealership. Next I open the hood to the car to check out the new engine and I try closing it and a piece that allows the truck to close completely is missing. At this point I'm really annoyed why the car is being driven without proper oil level and how they return it to the customer not in the right condition, by the way this is a limited edition 1 of 200 car as we take care of and maintain.

At this point I was extremely frustrated with the poor job they did and how they don't completely finish a 25,000$ job on the car. I ended up leaving the car again and bringing a loaner home after wasting 3 hours of my day commuting and dealing with this.

To go along with all these horrible insidents 3 years when the car was in for service, one of the service workers hit the back right of the car and  of course never recorded it in the system and have no way of tracking it... This just shows how this dealership doesn't do a good job taking care of its customers. Dealing with this dealership is a disappointment, never dealing with Valencia BMW again.<//Text>

I really loved this place. We worked with Sergik and he was great. Didn't buy the car we wanted because it turned out to be sold (at another dealership). So we left. When we returned, my husband wanted to make sure we kept working with Sergik because he was so professional. I'm glad my husband had insisted because it turned out well. We'd totally go to this dealership again and we would definitely ask for Sergik.

UPDATE: We ended up buying an i3 there (3.5 years ago). And every time we bring it in for servicing, I'm always impressed with the friendly staff and quick turnaround. Love this place!<//Text>

<Review>I went in looking for a 128 convertible and end up with a 328i convertible. Johnny gave an excellent deal on the car. I'm very happy with my car , this is the 5th BMW I've leased. Im really happy with the Service and with the time it took to get it all done. I go to Valencia BMW to service my car and they're excellent . Jessica is the best.
Next time you want a car go see Johnny, he is great and if you need to service your car , go to Jessica.<//Review>< pictures>

My wife and I had a trip planned to LA months in advance for our anniversary. Needless to say on our way down the car overheated on I5 "grapevine" on our way into LA. The nearest dealer was BMW Valencia. This was a Friday afternoon around 4:30 pm, I didn't have much confidence in getting any help. I was so wrong, the service dept took care of us. We got a loaner and were on our way in an less than an hour. They replaced the water pump and serviced the 335 while we enjoyed the weekend.  Would recommend them to anyone, considering the service we  got for someone from out of town who didn't purchase a car from them.
Special thanks to Robert our service adviser.

<Review>Interestingly enough, I was speaking to a coworker yesterday, who also owns a BMW, and asked him where he had his service done. He mentioned Valencia BMW, we both gave each other that acknowledging frown and proceeded to rant about how poor this dealership is in regards to it's service department. I'm sorry, I wish I had better things to say, but the Valencia BMW service and parts departments have a lot of work to do to even come close to the customer service I commonly experience at Honda, Fiat, VW or even Ford.

Based on my past visits to your service department, I find the Valencia BMW staff indifferent and inattentive, everyone seems like they're just going through the motions. During my most recent visit, while waiting to drop off my car, someone came in who appeared to have worked at this location before and the friendly attention he received was more in line of what your paying customers should receive.

And the wait times, dropping off or picking up, are far too long, even when you have a scheduled appointment. This isn't the first time I've had to wait this long, it happens every time. During my most recent service appointment, I had a 5:40pm scheduled drop-off, I arrived and checked-in early and still wasn't seen by the service advisor until almost 6:10pm.

Then when I came to pick up the car the next day, the porter took almost 30 minutes to bring my car up to the front, even though the waiting room seemed virtually empty. To further my frustration, the porter also left some nice, greasy black streaks on my beige floor mats! Do you folks use any of the paper floor covers that other car dealerships use to protect their customer's interiors?

Adding to this wonderful experience, I walked into the parts departments and a bell rang to alert the staff that there was someone up front waiting to purchase some genuine BMW parts. I stood in a completely empty room for over 10 minutes. I finally went back to the entrance door, opened and closed several times get the door bell to ring a few times before someone finally came out to help me.

Last but not least, is it that difficult for BMW Valencia to set up a system where I can pay for and pick up my parts in the parts department instead of being made to walk back to the indifferent staff at the service desk, pay for my item there, then have to walk back to the parts department to pick up the part? Honda, VW, Fiat and Ford parts departments allow me to pay for and pick up my parts at the same desk. You guys might want to check out your competition. It makes for a much better customer experience.< /Review><userid>114545278875605527855< /userid>< Gmap_id>

That should answer any questions about my satisfaction with this product. What amaze me this time was the skill or to use a big word, the alacrity of the process that made it the most enjoyable lease experience of my BMWs since my first in 1978. Jim my salesperson was more than I could have asked for and Gary in finance would be a valuable asset to any organization. I could go on and I would certainly like to but I have a busy day ahead in my new 750i from Valencia BMW. Stop searching and share the AutoNation experience at Valencia BMW. Nice to know that in 2018 business deals still go down this way in the retail Market. Run don't walk to see Jim and Gary when considering your first or next Ultimate Driving Machine.

5 star, great service.  My loaner car was great, I was kept informed as my car was repaired using my certified pre-owned warranty (only $ charge was the deductible). My car was returned after being washed and in perfect working condition. My service advisor Michael Teron was awesome

< Review>
After many years with another BMW dealer, last year I went to Valencia BMW to lease my M4. The leasing process was easy and painless and I did get a much better deal than from my former dealer. For the last 18 months I have been to Valencia BMW three times for service and each time they have been excellent both in the way they have treated me personally and the way they have taken care of my car. I am extremely happy to have chosen Valencia BMW and will continue to give them my business. Thanks to staff especially Chris and Brian at their service department.

It wasn't the best or the worst experience. It was a long distance deal- I bought the car sight un-seen and worked the deal virtually. I had never done that before and I fully expected it would be different, but figured the dealership would work to help me understand the process. They did, but it was challenging. I never felt like my salesman had any interest in the deal, or making it work for me,  or had any enthusiasm for helping me understand the long distance process - he just kept saying "it'll take a while." - Which is fine, I just felt that he could have/should have proactively given me an idea of what it would take, what he would do, and what to expect - which is good customer service. Instead, I just asked a ton of questions and felt they were met with short answers that weren't overly helpful. It was just a lack of explanation in general with the deal that was frustrating. Autonation, offers a 3 day 250-mile warranty that was voided on my deal - likely (I can only assume) because it was a long distance deal. Again, that's not a problem, I had no intentions of returning, but that's an important issue that probably should have been explained. The finance guy was totally rude, I left him a message declining his added products and never got a call back to confirm that the paperwork was on the way - which I think is just rude. There was some issue with the temporary permits - admittedly, I'm not totally clear on what happened, but the optics of it appeared that my salesman dropped the ball and then tried to blame it on someone else when I was frustrated because I couldn't drive the car. Again, it may have just been optics but it felt off. Ultimately, the deal got done, I got the car, and nothing went catastrophically wrong - it was just a general lack of interest by the salesman, I found it odd that he never picked up the phone and called me and last, but not least, that he never bothered to thank me for my business. I know it was long distance and we never met, but I still had a choice of where to go and I chose here - so some appreciation by way of a simple "thank you for doing business with us" - doesn't seem to be an unreasonable ask. In the end I have a great car and I'm glad about that. Like I said, it wasn't worst, but it was far from the best (which is somewhat expected from a BMW dealer).<//text>

<review>Ripoff. I purchased/leased a $95K BMW 750i and had problems with it from almost day one. Each step of the way, they denied that the car had safety issues claiming "customer claimed" and swept everything under the rug. The car doors wouldn't close yet the car would drive, the tires were almost deflated and I needed to constantly fill it up with oil. I've had $500 cars that had less issues. Never had issues with Mercedes or any other car company. Don't bother buying or leasing a BMW (7 series or not). Save your time and money. You can do better. I will NEVER buy another BMW<//review>< Rating>

First class service team. I cannot praise them enough for going above and beyond to accommodate my tight schedule. Service advisor Michael is really something special. Even though I was out of the BMW warranty, he did his due diligence and realized my problem fell under a California state warranty, saving me $2000. I can't thank these guys enough. The whole team really pulled together to make sure they could help me faster than expected. Come here for your BMW service needs!!!<//Review>

This was my first time at BMW Valencia and after visiting several dealerships to find the right car, I can say hands down this place offers EXCEPTIONAL service hands down!

Our sales rep, Julius was extremely helpful in finding us the perfect car we were looking for to lease. He took his time to provided us with the best options while still remaining within our budget. And even when we were deciding between a few cars, he didn't show any hesitation for letting us test drive the models we liked. Sammy, the general manager checked in with us several times and made sure the whole process for us was smooth and easy! Even the finance officer was extremely nice and gave us his honest opinion about what maintenance package was right for us.

Overall, I had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend giving them your business.
So excited for my car and I couldn't be more thankful to Valencia BMW for making it possible <3< /text>

My experience with Robert Rowland was a great. I had a rattle underneath the dash board that maintenance was not able to find. Robert took the extra time to help find the disturbing rattle behind the glove box and had it fixed. My only complaint was with the shuttle service on the pick up. I waited for over an hour only being 6 miles away from the dealership. I ended getting a ride from one of my employees. That was below average.< /review>

<Text>I went in to purchase a used Lexus RX350 for my daughter.  I was assured that this used vehicle went through a comprehensive 150 point inspection.  My wife encouraged me to buy our used car from a "reputable" dealer convincing me that they would not cheat us, but instead be safer to buy a used car from them then from a small dealer or private party.  WRONG!!!

I took in the used Lexus we purchased from Valencia BMW (the car that was supposed to be inspected by professionals at Valencia BMW) into my local Lexus dealership the next day for routine maintenance, and to my shock given estimates for over $4000 in critical repairs!!!

I should have known when the first thing they listed was new battery because the battery cover to the resoivoir on top was missing.  Obviously, they can't get a cover to match, but you would think that when VBMW listed that they checked the battery, they would have listed this obvious missing piece....or maybe they did not check the battery at all.  Anyway, Lexus service department says I have: leaking transmission O-ring, torn control arm bushings, leaking steering rack which means complete rack replacement and alignment, leaking front light housing.

Should any of these been caught at inspection????? Maybe??? Maybe not???

The point is that when I called the next day to explain the situation to my salesman Willie, he essentially says sorry, the car is sold AS IS!  Nothing he can do and that I should complain to the used car manager.  He did not even offer to talk to the manager on by behalf....just sorry nothing we can do, out of luck, the car is as is.  Don't remind me that it is as is...I f&$@ing know that!!!  I get it...you got your money.

Now I completely understand as is, and I have bought dozens of used cars in the past.  My issue is that Valencia BMW says they do a "comprehensive" 150 point inspection to make sure that used cars are worthy to be sold on their lot, BUT I certainly feel like that the inspection was done poorly, because someone should have caught some of these obvious repair issues...Lexus did!

I don't know cars, but I trust that when Valencia BMW "says" that they checked it, I believe them.

My mistake!

At the end of the day, Valencia BMW DID NOTHING to try to make things right with me, not even a follow-up call after I communicated my issue to Willie my salesman.  It's all on them now.

Decide for yourself if that is who you want to do business with....</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1492433863643, 'text': "Crispin, thank you for leaving this detailed feedback about your experience with our dealership.

< Review>
When I called to schedule my break in inspection and oil change I requested a loaner because I had to errands to run. When I show up to drop off my car they repeatedly tried to get me to stay on premises and wait for my car. After repeatedly requesting my loaner I finally got it, but only after waiting 45 minutes.

I get called to come pick up my car after 4 hours which I do and from reading the receipt it looks like they just stared at my car for 4 hours because no oil change was done, no inspection notes were filled out, nothing.

I am now going to drive past this dealership to another dealership to get my maintenance done. I do not feel like Valencia BMW has the same customer service I have grown accustom to.<//Review>

<username>Doug Lodder</username><review>Regardless of where you live, do yourself a favor and give Lilly at Valencia BMW a call.  I was shopping for a new BMW and getting pushed around the local dealership.  I started looking for alternatives and found Lilly through a reference.  When she didn't have the exact car I wanted, she offered to order it.  When it arrived a few weeks early while I was on vacation, she made sure it was there when I returned.  Finally, she drove well over an hour to deliver the car to my office!  We signed the paperwork in 20 minutes and that was it.  Best car buying experience ever.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

<review>Dealerships do make a difference -- Valencia BMW does it right!  After searching for 5-series online and working with other dealers, I called Valencia and made an appointment with Madison.  She was attentive and professional with great follow-up -- unlike other dealerships.  Driving 50+ miles to test drive car, she had it ready and waiting!  The showroom is beautiful, well-organized and the welcome kiosk with customers name a nice touch!  After sealing the deal, Madison turned me over to Amir in finance.  Amir was thorough, did not overtly push extras and was easy to work with making the financing portion seamless.  This dealership was one of the best experiences I've had having bought several cars -- I highly recommend this group if you want the Ultimate Car Purchase!  Kudos to all.< /review>< Name>

This place is ridiculous i show up for my appointment. Then still have to wait, just for advisor robert perez. To be rude.  I wanted a key programmed to my car an i know you can. But he didnt even  let me have seat or explain. Just i beed go parts new key will be $500. He looked at me and said “are you robert? What you want?”.  An i dont know if its because i look young. Will never go to that dealership ever. I dont want to be a bother to mr perez.  il take my business else where an also tell friends n family that have bmw to not bother with this place. He said you guys dont do key  programming but in my confirmation email says “  Repair Services: Miscelaneous - KEY PROGRAMMING “< /Text>

This past Saturday (04/28/2018), we stopped by Valencia BMW to look at a used Suburban.  We took it for a test drive, and told the sales guy we still had a couple of more vehicles to check out before we made a decision.  My husband called Sathy, our sales guy that same night (Saturday) and made an offer on the vehicle.  He said he would call us back in the morning after speaking with his manager.  We waited around for the call on Sunday morning and finally decided to just drive up there as we intended to buy the vehicle anyways.  Our sales guy from the previous day was there and we spoke to him for a bit before his sales manager, Ryan Annett came out.  Now, we were just trying to get the best price we could on this used vehicle but apparently, Autonation does not negotiate with their pricing.  The sales manager made sure to keep pointing this out and said that’s the way it is and there is nothing they can do about it.  Only corporate could change it.  He had all but a couple of minutes for us and then just walked away.  We told our sales guy we would discuss this privately for a few minutes (in the car) about it and would let him know.  Five minutes later, we decide to buy the vehicle and went inside to look for Sathy.  We sat in their lobby for about 5 minutes before Sathy finally showed up.  We told him we wanted the vehicle and asked if it could be detailed.  He left to speak with his sales manager for what seemed like 10 minutes.  When he finally came back, he brought his sales manager with him, Ryan.  Ryan then proceeds to tell us that they cannot sell us the vehicle anymore because someone reserved it online.  He said that person would be coming in at 7pm that night and we would have to wait till after to hear back from them if it was sold or not.  Then we were just sent on our way.  We were there on Saturday to look at the vehicle, returned on Sunday to buy the vehicle, and now Ryan tells us that they have to give an opportunity to the person who placed it on hold to look at the vehicle?!  We are in disbelief.  We are standing inside the showroom, ready to buy the vehicle but now we cannot because someone has reserved it.  Ryan says there is nothing they can do but they would call us in the evening if the vehicle does not sell.  I could not believe they turned us away because they had someone else who was interested in the vehicle.  I’m sure they would not have done this to us if were buying a 60k BMW.  I have never been so insulted or embarrassed in my life.  We had cash on hand, ready to buy the vehicle but Ryan used the excuse that someone else reserved the vehicle while we were there so now we cannot buy it.  We never received a call later that evening or even Monday morning to let us know if it sold or not.  A courtesy phone call would have been nice.  It is Tuesday morning and we are still waiting to hear back.  Talk about lousy customer service.  Before all this went down, I should mention what I observed between their staff.  While my husband and I were outside discussing the vehicle, a sales girl walked out of the office.  She began to speak to another employee (male) as he was walking towards her and he flat out passed right by her and ignored her.  He continued on his way towards the office and she turned back and asked him if he was going to help her of if she should ask anyone else.  Again, he ignored her and went into the office.  She soon followed him in and was walking behind him talking to him and he did not acknowledge her.  What kind of business are you running Mr. Coia?  Your employees seem hostile towards each other.  That explains why your sales manager had no time to waste on us.  No respect for each other or customers who are not buying high end vehicles.</text>

They wouldn't fix my airbag light when it came back on after they replaced a seat sensor at no charge due to a service bulletin. They had my car for 3 days with no work done. Over the phone I was told there was a pinched cable in the battery compartment from the battery being replaced at an independent repair shop, and the BMW dealer wanted over $450 to replace the cable. I declined the repair as I wanted to make the independent shop pay for the repair of the damaged cable. The dealer gave me the car back, without any paperwork explaining their supposed find, ( which I thought was odd), on the 3rd day without even removing the battery to check their pinched cable assumption and refused to remove the airbag light unless the expensive "repair" was performed.
I arrived at the independent repair shop very upset thinking they damaged my car. In my presence he mechanic removed the battery to check for damaged cables. I couldn't believe what I was seeing but there weren't any damaged or pinched cables at all. The cables were positioned correctly. I will not be going back to that dealership for any reason ever again.< /review>

We limped to to dealer in Valencia and asked that they help us with the problem and we were late to a party for our new Grandson. Robert the service adviser said not to worry. He checked our contract and we had tire coverage, he provided a loner car within 10 min and made sure we got to the party. The dealer ordered 2 new tires aligned The from end and made sure we were able to continue home the next day. Valencia BMW turned what could have been a bad day into a wonderful customer experience. I can thank them and Robert enough for what they were able to do for us in such a small window of time.
Thanks again !!</review>< Pictures>

On Sunday, we went for a drive to just look at a car (X3) and decided to purchase 2 cars (X3 & 750). Thank you Johnny Camp for taking care of us so well. It's nice to have a champion for you when dealing with the transaction and Johnny made it as easy as possible. We received good interest rates, terms, they took our trade in's at decent value, and we love our new cars.
Talk about going the extra mile. It was my wife's birthday on Monday and we live in Los Angeles; well Johnny offered to drive down from Valencia in my wife's new X3, to LA and pick up her trade in, X3 M saving her the trip up on her birthday.
100% satisfaction to Johnny Camp and his team at Valencia BMW.< /text>

<Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>103365275516369929713< /UserId.><review>Bought a used car from these GANGSTERS and it NEVER went thru the certified pre-owned check. The tires were almost completely flat when I drove it off the lot and the warning lights came on. The car had damage to the front end where it wasn't noticeable. A week after I had been driving the car, one of the wheel skirts inside the wheel well fell off. When I crawled under the car I noticed the front bumper was being held onto the car with cable ties (zip ties). When I returned to the dealership to have them fix it, they accused me of the damaging the car and refused to fix it. I complained to the BMW Corporation. They said they "investigated" and of course they sided with Valencia BMW. I also talked to a "lemon" lawyer in Valencia about them and he said he "knew them well" because he had won several lawsuits against this dealership. I wouldn't buy a skateboard from these GANGSTERS. Stay away. Stay far far away from these CROOKS. Do your business with another BMW dealership. You have been warned.<//review>< rating>

Great place but don't come here for service if you need a loaner car especially if It's for a warranty job. They used to rent me one from Enterprise but I guess times have changed.  I told our service advisor that my son needed his car to go to school in Hollywood, and asked if they can rent him a car since they have no loaners available. Our service advisor Roberto apologized and told us he's sorry but they don't rent cars anymore for customers since BMW stopped re-imbursing them for it. I just told my three sons to find another BMW dealer close to school or work next time you need service, even though we live in Valencia. Sad because we have four BMWs in my household.</text>

If you are like us, getting a new car can be a full day event and very tiring and aggravating with waiting around, paperwork and more waiting around.

We were in and out with all paperwork and contracts done in about 3 hours.  He is an awesome salesman who really listened to us when we told him what features we wanted.  He wasn't the "pushy" salesman trying to sell us anything else that we didn't already specify, even though he told us all the features available in other models and he answered all of our questions about other features.

He found me the perfect car.  By the way.....love my 428i it is definitely a much better ride than my 328i and I loved that car.  I had to switch because the 328i isn't available in a coupe....so sad.  I have more bells and whistles though and that makes my driving experience so much better.

I have only been a BMW driver since 2011.  Valencia BMW has made my experience a really FANTABULOUS one.  I also have to mention the Service Dept.  Wow, so awesome. So quick and to the point, you are in and out at the time frame they give you.

My favorite Service Writer and the main reason I decided to come over to BMW is Michelle Wells. I followed her here from a previous dealership that she worked when I had my previous car.  She is honest and sincere and so very caring and kind and she knows what she is talking about.  Thank you Valencia BMW...you have a customer for life.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Poor customer service with service department. Extremely difficult to reach a service adviser by phone to get simple questions answered.  Got transferred to voicemail several times even after I specifically asked receptionist not to be sent to voicemail. Left 4 messages, yet after several days finally had to go in person because not one service adviser returned my calls . After sending my car in, I had to initiate calling to get status updates. My repair was a warranty repair, which they begrudgingly covered (which earned them the second star in this review).  I expect this is why they didn't want to deal with my issue.  I have never experienced such back customer service with an auto dealership.<//Text>< name>

I was referred to Willie Dalgan at Valencia BMW and I was very apprehensive at first due to my credit, but shortly after speaking with Willie I was put at ease. He is a very compassionate and honest person ... Not so much interested in getting a car off the lot, but more concerned about finding the right car for ME!

Throughout the entire process I was treated with respect and never felt any pressure. Willie did what is most important when purchasing a vehicle .. He listened. After speaking with him a few times, he compiled a list of cars that fit my needs and my budget.  When I arrived at the dealership he had everything mapped out - making my experience very stress free!

If you're in the market for a car ... Not just a BMW but any car ... And you're in Valencia .. Go to the Valencia BMW dealership and ask for Willie ... He will NOT let you down!!!<//Review>

A friend suggested I go to Robert Grass in Valencia and it was the BEST suggestion. Robert was brilliant, completely and thoroughly knowledgeable about BMWs and cars , dealt with me with respect and straight talk. I already felt he was the person I would buy my cars from just from our phone conversations and the prompt follow up with his sending me quotes and options.
I needed to trade in my BMW 4 series convertible which was a 2016 and which I owned outright , then lease a BMW SUV , so I was concerned initially (until Robert) that I might get taken advantage of on this transaction. I didn't want the hassle of selling my car if I could be assured I would get a good trade in, which Robert did!
I was greeted by his wonderful assistant almost immediately when I got to showroom and was shown cars that I had expressed interest in which Robert had cleverly brought up to be parked right outside showroom.
I can honestly say I have never had a better car buying experience! I will use him for all my future cars and refer anyone I can to him.<//Text>

STAY AWAY!!! I wish there was a zero star option available cause they don't even deserve one star. Every one from the sales people to the managers are the biggest cheaters and liars you will ever see who will do anything to sell a car. Not only I am taking them to court for fraud and misrepresentation, I found out they sold a car that was involved in an accident as "new" to another customer. This is an example of how they conduct business.</Text>

<Date>1523650826020<//Date><Rate>2<//Rate><review>Leased a new 2018 M550i from Valencia BMW April 31. Because of the deal, drove the 70 mile to their facility from the OC. Though I got a good price, the dealership experience was not close to my previous BMW purchases at other dealers. When I got there, the car was being washed. That was good. but as I was doing the financial paperwork, they pull the car up and park it in their customer parking lot. They're undergoing some renovation, and the car was parked next to some construction pickups. Not the best way to appreciate your new vehicle. After finishing the paperwork, I was given the keys and got a thank you, and that was it. No attempt from the salesman or from their BMW Genius to go over the vehicle with me, the technology, or get a chance to ask questions. I drove off, and did not realize until about 10 miles later, that the gas tank was only 1/4 full. Too much of a hassle to drive back on the traffic filled 5 freeway for a fill up, we're only talking about $50, but hey. About a week later, could not get some of the technology to work, called the Genius hot line for some answers. They find out that salesman, had forgotten to have me sign the EAS agreement which is required to activate certain features. Come on, this is not new to them. Called the dealership back, they asked for me to drive back to fill out. Told them no, and they finally took care of it. A few days later, I called my salesman again with a question about my wifi hotspot and how to activate. He did not know anything about it. He said he'll have to investigte it and get back to me. I also mentioned the lack of a full gas tank to him. He was very apologetic and offered to wash the car if I brought it back. That wasn't going to happen. He then offered to send out some key chains and a coffee mug. Better than nothing I guess. Almost 7 days later, still no return call about the wifi hotspot. I'm not expecting any keychains or a coffee mug soon either. In summary, good price, but lousy follow through.< /review>< Pictures>

I purchased a 3 year old BMW 328 XI wagon from Valencia BMW, they sold me a car that should have been fitted with run flat tires as there was no spare. They totally blew me off when I complained that the front and rear tires were different brands and none of them were run flat. Thanks BMW!!< /Review>

This was our first visit to Valencia BMW and we had an excellent experience!

Sergik Haftvani (Internet Sales), Sean Crawford (Sales Manager), and Mickey Williams (Finance Manager) were all outstanding!  All three are BMW owners, have a lot of BMW experience, and were a wealth of knowledge.  They were not aggressive, very patient and answered all of our inquiries since this was our first BMW 328i purchase.

As a Customer Service Manager, I recognize and really appreciate great service! The whole experience was not stressful and they make you feel like you are amongst friends. They did an excellent job tailoring our car package and we are ecstatic!

Our new car is amazing, it drives just like it’s advertised and it has the highest rating in Consumer Report and Edmunds.  I will definitely recommend Valencia BMW to all our friends and family.<//text>

Worst customer service & experience ever! We were being scrambled with numbers to end it with them changing the numbers even more & not being authentic with what we had discussed from the beginning. First of all the first salesman we had I believe was named Richie & he looked a mess & didn’t seem like he was ok on the job more like he was on something he handed us off to The next salesperson we had was a white younger woman with light brown hair. Next to richies desk & so rude I was appalled at how rude she was. To top it off we got offered water & coffee 2 hours later. Never going back I’ll just stick to my bmw in Bakersfield here in Bakersfield they have the best service ever so nice & pleasant all the time.< /review>

Lillian Rodriguez is one of the most professional sales individuals I've ever dealt with in the auto business. I've done a lot of leases and with all the run around and hiding information, it's no longer the same business. I got Lilian's number through a referral, and the first time I called her I knew she was the one we were going to deal with. She was prompt, courteous, honest, and followed up even though the first few times we interacted she didn't have our desired vehicle. Valencia BMW is doing something right. Thank you so much for the bmw Lilian. Art Prehjan.< /Text>

Oh my gosh where to begin. Well we just purchased a CPO X5 2 weeks ago. Our salesperson Madison was excellent. She is a very lovely young lady and was very pleasant to work with. The finance guy on the other hand was not so great so after 5 hours after sitting at the  dealership feeling like our heads were going to explode we finally got to leave with our 2013 X5. When we got to run the car on the freeway i knew that something was off on the alignment. I checked our paperwork and on their CPO checklist it stated that it was good but I took it to our local BMW dealership 2 days after purchase. They checked the alignment and it failed and so we ended up paying $265 to get it done. We contacted the sales manager at Valencia BMW and he said he would reimburse us for the cost. I thought wow thats nice but we still haven't seen anything so I'm not banking on it.

Then today i finally took the car in to get it washed (put it off due to the recent rain) and noticed that the passager side back door had scratches on the door. They took a closer look and told me the car had bondo on it and a poor paint job. From there I went to a local autobody shop to get a more accurate opinion and they confirmed that the bondo is starting to crack and would need to repair and repaint it approximately $800 to $1000.

So long story short I'm extremly disappointed. I know that we purchased a used car and I don't expect perfection however when I think of BMW CPO I think quality and that wasn't what we got. The people at Valencia BMW are very nice (with maybe the exception of the finance guy) but I do feel bamboozled. I would say if you go there please just really examine the vehicle, take your time and look at everything so that you don't end up regretting your purchase.< /review>

<time>1361557670107</time><rating>5< /rating><review>I leased a new 2013 328i coupe recently from Sean Crawford.  This is my 3rd or 4th BMW, so I am familiar with the vehicle and BMW FS.  As it is a commodity, I compared several dealers and a couple brokers - the terms were the best at Valencia from the starting verbal quote.  Very little negotiation was necessary, since Sean met my major requirements right off the bat - sales price, money factor, monthly payment, push forward, down payment drive off, color and options.  I live in Woodland Hills, and drove to Valencia to pick up the car.  There was no bait and switch when I sat down with the finance manager to sign the agreement, so no waste of my time nor theirs.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I had a great experience with the team at Valencia BMW.  Sergik was very professional, knowledgable, and friendly.  I would definitely recommend him.  I had been looking for a relatively specific vehicle, and although I was coming from over 60 miles away, everything Sergik and I spoke about on the phone was what he delivered when I got there.  Hector in finance was also professional, straight-forward, informative, and a pleasure to deal with.  His Closer did come in to try to sell additional warranty coverage, but that's just part of the process.  Overall, the experience was pain free.</review>

i initially leased a 2014 BMW at Valencia BMW and had a wonderful experience with the then internet manager Greg and went back to Valencia BMW even though it's quite far from my home to lease a new car. Sorry to say the experience was terrible. On two occasions I asked for the sales manager to return my call to answer my questions and on both occaions my calls were not returned. The finance manager was rude because I didn't  want to buy any extras that he was selling. Getting a new car should be a exciting experience. Next time I'll go somewhere else. Valencia BMW has lost my respect.<//Text>

We got the car we wanted, at the price we wanted, and we are very happy with it. Sergik and the staff were all very friendly, though the process was quite slow. We were left waiting for this or that a few times. Had we known we would be waiting for almost an hour to meet with the finance guy we would have gone out for lunch. I'm 7 months pregnant, a girls gotta eat! When everything was signed and completed, we thought we were finally on our way only to wait another 15 minutes for our car to be washed. Couldn't they have done that while we were in financing? Again, all very friendly and easy to work with, but the longest car buying experience ever.< /review>

They didn't honor the appointment time at 8:40 on Monday, and claimed they couldn't reach me to tell me.  Car was finished Tuesday at 10:00am.  Although their porter (only guy i could get to help me) heard the noise my car was making and agreed with me, they claimed it made no noise and asked me to further explain the problem.  No loaners available, and did't wash my vehicle after promising.  The only thing pleasant was the girl at the desk trying to manage the obvious disorganization in the service department.  Food for thought, don't overbook appointments, and don't tell your clients that you did.  People spend the money on your product for a reason.   Never going back.< /review>< Pics>

One of the Worst Post-Sale Customer Services Ever! They sell you with a smile, and then after that if you need something, good luck speaking to a person that actually helps you, because their phone system only works if you’re trying to buy something!

My issue happened last year and I submitted surveys too, and nobody responded then.
The only person that was helpful there and followed up with my issue was Willie Dalgan, in the sales department.
The rest of the Managment don’t care enough to call you and ask.
Gary in the finance department also sold us the worst extended warranty from Easy Care, that I’m trying to cancel now at the moment. He sold it to us as one of the best warranties and coverages and now that we have problem with the car, we realize it wasn’t true. It should be called “Not Easy Care”</text>

Mr. Camp was patient, knowledgable, friendly, and bent over backwards to help us decide on the car that was right for us.  We were never made to feel like we were wasting his time (if you want to know what I mean, go test drive a Porsche 911 in LA) as we spent hours driving the BMW 328d, BMW 328 hybrid, and the BMW 335i.  Even after these test drives, we still couldn't make up our minds so Mr. Camp lined up the three different cars in front of the dealership so we could consider all the pros and cons of each.  What a patient salesman!  Honorable mention goes to Ali in Financing for giving us a great deal on a warranty/tire/wheel package.  However, Mr. Camp is reason why this dealership got our business.  No wonder they have the best reputation in the Valley.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I live in Los Angeles, and the ride out to Valencia BMW was well worth it.  No one in my research could touch their offers nor had as wide a selection of cars with various options as Valencia.

My research consisted of emailing and messaging every BMW and Audi dealership around Los Angeles. Messaging all the way down to Long Beach and as far east as Riverside.  I wanted to find the best deal on a 2017/2018 BMW 330e lease or a 2017/2018 Audi E-Tron with the options to fit my budget.

Yliana Fetterolf at Valencia was extremely professional, informative and patient throughout the entire finding/negotiating/buying experience.  She would consistently get back to me in a timely fashion (either email or phone) and show me different cars within my budget.  She was never pushy and made me feel confident that Valencia BMW was the place I'd be buying my car from.  I can't recommend her enough to anyone looking at buying or leasing a BMW.

I couldn't be more happy with the deal Valencia gave me on a 2018, 330e lease, no other dealership could come close. Yliana was completely awesome and made me feel comfortable the entire way.  Not only did she do everything in her power to find me the right 330e to fit within my budget but she also drove the car to me.

If you have a BMW in mind, chances are Valencia has it.  Every other dealership I called only had a few cars on their lot in my parameters or colors, whereas Yliana was able to search multiple other places until she found the car I wanted with the options and color I wanted.

Thank you Yliana and Valencia for the awesome buying experience. I highly recommend them and I'll be telling my family and friends to take the trip to Valencia for their next BMW as well!</review>

Our experience at BMW Valencia was nothing short of outstanding. We had visited several dealerships in the hunt for a small luxury sedan but upon arriving here we were convinced that we had come to the perfect place. Sammy Kobeissi was extremely hospitable and made us feel right at home. The entire process, from sales to finance, was seamless and low pressure. The atmosphere at the dealership was very warm and inviting, there was a jazz band playing and they had hors d'oeuvre available. BMW Valencia has just earned themselves a lifelong customer, we love our new car and thank you for such a great experience.< /review>

<Text>I was Leary about the new run flat tires when l initially bought the car.  However, the salesman "sold" me on the comparative advantages of the tires.
When my wife called me stranded in a remote parking lot with the tow truck at least an hour  away, l immediately left work to meet her. ($$$). Once we got home, l made arrangements to go to Valencia BMW to get some of her necessities out of the car.  Nobody seemed to know anything about her car and her advisor,(Robert) was "busy". Somebody finally found her car and l was able to retrieve.  No other conversation took place.
The next day, when l called about the car l was told by the "desk girl" our guy Robert was off ' nothing happened with our car.  The warranty people hadn't gotten back to them. (Pisser)!  Now it's Monday and we had to figure a way to get my wife to work & back.  When l checked in with Roberr during the day he informed me that the tire wouldn't be there until the next day. (Double pisser!) At that time l asked why this tie thing became a 4 day operation when l could get 4 tires changed out in a tire shop in ONE HOUR!  And why didn't we get a loaner?  "Oh you could have gotten a loaner!" He says... News to me... Too late! Top it off with the $200 alignment fee & $50 warranty deductible fee and all in all it was a pretty MISERABLE experience.  I can't wait to get out of this car!< /Text><resp>{'time': 1465930546062, 'text': "Hi Tom, we appreciate you taking the time to respond. The staff at Valencia BMW take our reviews very seriously.

My family and I have purchased 6 BMW from this dealership over the past several years and every time we gave their service the benefit of doubt, we regretted immensely. Today, It took me more than 1 hour and 30 min to speak to a service adviser or anyone in the parts just to find out if they have a tire for my 2015 BMW I purchased from them last year. BMW North Hollywood and Long Beach BMW are by far better than this dealership. The service adviser who we used to go to moved to another dealership and told me that how horrible this dealership treats its employees. This dealership belongs to filthy rich family who own more than 200 dealership across US "Auto Nation" and care so little about the well-being of their employees. No service adviser last long in this horrible dealership whose only interest is greed and profit. I shall never ever buy another car from them.< /Text>

<text>I was researching I3 lease deals throughout Southern California and found that Valencia had by far the best rates. They also had the best selection of I3's and I was able to find exactly the model, package, and color I wanted with the help of Rine Sanchez. Rine made everything very easy and was a pleasure to work with. (This is saying a lot as I test drove models at the Beverly Hills dealership before heading to Valencia and was not a fan of customer service or pushiness at the Beverly Hills location.) He also sat with me and talked me through all the features and was very knowledgable about the car. I feel like I'm in very good hands should I need any assistance with my I3 in the future!</text><Name>Arwen Byrd<//Name>< response>

Look no further, Valencia BMW is the place to go for your car buying/leasing. I went by other reviewers & asked for Willie D., when I walked into the dealership & I'm glad I did! He had an appt with another client but he made sure I was being helped by him & Gregg Nagel. These 2 awesome guys were a breeze to work with, they made sure I was happy from sales to financing. I still have a huge smile driving in my new 2016 535i, not only because of the great deal I got but also great top notch service. Even after a few days, they continued to follow up with me to make sure I was satisfied. They truly went above & beyond my expectations. If you want nothing but the best, ask for Willie D. & Gregg Nagel, you can't go wrong with these guys at Valencia BMW! 5 stars, double thumbs up!< /review>

<Review>My service advisor was friendly and knowledgeable. When he asked if I was going to wait in the lobby while my car was being serviced, I said that I would pick it up later. I did not indicate a time. I called at noon to the service dept to inquire about an ETA of completion and left a message after several unanswered rings, figuring that everyone was out to lunch and asked if I could pick up my car by 3pm. I never received a call back and therefore I called again at 3pm, to the pleasant answer that my car was ready and they are just "looking for my keys" which would evidently take about 15 mins. I asked if I could go ahead and drive over since it would take me 15 mins to get there anyway, and the representative said yes. When I arrived, I was told I would have to wait another 15 mins for my vehicle. If I wasn't in a hurry anyway, I wouldn't have mind. However, coupled with the fact that no one had previously returned my call and now being told that my car wasn't ready after all, is the reason why I rated this particular service appt at 3 out of 5 stars. Everyone was friendly but their lack of communication and timeliness leaves a lot to be desired.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>We were referred to Robert Grass by a mutual acquaintance, and I have already thanked my friend for that referral.  I was reticent to deal with AutoNation because, quite frankly, they have a less-than-stellar reputation among consumers.  But what I learned is that the company is secondary to the people it employs, and I would go anywhere to do a transaction with Mr. Grass.  He explained what he needed to do in order to sell the car for the best price to me while simultaneously meeting the business profit needs of the company, and once I understood, I that was the end of the negotiation.  I agreed and now am the proud owner of a new 2017 BMW 750 M-Sport sedan.  The folks who arranged to deliver the car (Robert, Nathan and Chucky) were phenomenal, the paperwork was ready upon arrival and the car was detailed perfectly.  I cannot more highly recommend Fleet Manager Robert Grass and his entire team at Valencia BMW!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Ever since I bought my 535i, there has been nothing but trouble with this dealership. To begin with, the first salesman was extremely eager to sell, but not eager to please the customer. The very next day, I called up the dealership and told him that I was looking at two cars in particular. The one I had seen the day before, and another one that I was entertaining at Rusnak. I was assigned to a salesman by the name of Ritchie. As I had already spoken with another salesman the day before, whose name unfortunately I have forgotten, Ritchie only performed the bare minimum in terms of securing his half of the commission on the sale of my new car. I bought the car which was in the show room. It appeared pristine and beautiful. I check the car inside and out. I was unable to test drive it, as it was inside the show room and there were other cars in front and behind it. I liked the car so much that I bought it without test driving it. The next day, I went to pick up my car. It had a busted out tail lens. It was a minor thing, but I noticed it. In fact, what I notice more was the scratch which was pretty big. I cannot believe they actually had the nerve to give me that car in that condition. I pointed that out to them. I had told him that this was not what was in the show room the day before. I also advised them not to take buyers for granted, because a car with these damages would not have been in their show room in the first place. The other thing, when I opened up the trunk to inspect, it's not horribly of Asian food. I brought this to the attention of the sales man, who pretended not to smell it. He called his other buddy, another salesman, and he also pretended not to smell it. As there were other shoppers in the area, I figured they would be neutral parties. I invited them to smell my trunk. All of the shoppers agree that there was a nasty stench of food in the trunk of the car. I finally spoke with one of the service people. They also smelled it. I believe that girls name was Vanessa. She was very quick to say that she would resolve all problems for me, and she did. Vanessa truly took care of the problems. Incidentally, the finance manager also smelled the stench in the trunk and stated that there was no way anyone could not smell that. It was obvious at that time that the two salesmen were lying. On the documentation, they put that the automobile had 6009 miles on it. When I got the car it had 6035. You can make your own assumptions about that. It is obvious that they took the car out of the showroom and drove around for a while. The very next day, I noticed there was a problem with the Bluetooth re: phone connecting. I would have to make two calls in order to actually have the one call come through the speakers on the phone. I called at the dealership. Vanessa stated this was "a known problem" and that it would be a simple software fix which will take approximately two hours. This last Friday, my husband came to town. I asked him to call the dealership to deal not only with this software issue, but the trier pressure monitor problem as well, which is also a known BMW problem. My husband was told to come on down and take the car. That is exactly what he did. When he got there, he was greeted by Bob in the service department. Bob told my husband that was nothing wrong with the car and that he did not have a loaner. He was incredibly rude to my husband. I was out of town at the time but I called to speak with a manager, Darren. Darren was also incredibly rude. He was not interested in hearing about what had taken place when my husband went down there. He also denied any known problems. Then he kept insisting on when we were going to bring it back. So now everybody is inconveniencing them selves to once again take this car down to the dealership for software adjustments. In the process, I do want to point out that Darren stated that he had 15 loaner cars. Therefore, it is obvious that Bob lied. This dealership has made it's mark with lying. This is upsetting considering I bought a service contract on top of the car.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881<//gmap_id>< Time>

They are very accomodating, but i wasnt happy how they handle service with my car. brought the car back for inspection since the breaks had begun making noise 2 days after i got the car, i understand that its a used vehicle but i was also advised that it went through a theral inspection before putting it for sale.

After they inspected my car no one came and explained to me whats going on, i just recieved the summary of the service on paper that i signed and i had to read and decifer on what that said paper mean. Well my understanding was that it was normal for it to make noise? Because of dust build up on the rotors and break? I know my way around cars and dust doesnt make a metal to metal scraping noise.</text>

<review>This is was by far the best car buying experience I had.  Grigor Georgizian, treated me like a family member; he did not try to offer me features that I was not interested in. In a very friendly matter he explained and answered all my questions.  He did not try to rush me and made sure that all of my concerns were addressed. I set up an appointment, the car was ready when I arrived for a test drive; I left the dealership in my brand new BMW 428i within couple of hours.  I experienced same level of hospitality from other employees at Valencia BMW, and would definitely recommend Valencia BMW for your next car purchase.

I went to other dealership and honestly felt like a target for sales rep looking to make a commission.  Valencia BMW is definitely not one of those type of a dealership.  The staff here is interested in the buyer making the right decision and being satisfied with their purchase

My new BMW 428i is the perfect definition of the Ultimate Driving Machine.< /review>< pictures>

Also I want to say thank you so much Charles Coia General

Thank you Kianoush

This was my second time after three years at BMW Valencia and I was very happy with my experience getting another new BMW X3.
Valencia BMW created a wonderful experience for leasing my car. Great deal and awesome staffs.
First of all a big thank you to Manager Kianoush Khalifeh for taking care of me and also thank you to Maryo Metry client advisor.

Went out to buy an M5 BMW cash. Everyone I spoke to was extremely rude and not helpful. They wanted my financials before I test drove the car my answer was no.  Then they came running after me telling me I don’t have to fill out financials my answer was no. I’m going to another dealership to order the car. The car I was looking  at Black with the brown interior.< /Review>

I have never, and would never, purchase a BMW.  However, I get email messages almost every day claiming that I have.  There are lots of Bob Elliotts in the World, but I'm not the one.< /Text>

They consistently ignored my concerns, emails, and phone calls. 7 frustrating months later I'm left with no plates. Complete deal breaker!

< Review>
I leased a 2013 X5 from this place. On the test drive of the X5 the car died and we had to be picked up(not out of gas). My wife really wanted an X5 so we decided to go ahead and get a different X5. The buying portion was pretty good.

When it comes to service....STAY AWAY. I've had on multiple occasions times where the service folks would not call back or give you updates on your car. I would come in early as possible(7am) for the regular oil change and I would not get the car until 4-5 in the evening JUST FOR AN OIL CHANGE. One time they surprisingly called me and told me my car was ready and was being washed. So I got dropped off at the service department only to wait for an hour and 20 min, after being told multiple times that my car was being washed. At this point it was taking so long I thought I was getting a detail LOL. When the car finally came out I was just going to hop in and leave, but something told me to do a walk around and boom this is when I saw a big yellow mark/scratch on the front corner bumper. I asked the person that brought the car up and he said "Oh it came in like that" which is a lie because the service adviser does a walk around with the customer(me) when you drop the car off and it was not there, I would have noticed. I told the service adviser and he had no words. They took it back and said they would fix it which they did. Then I started wondering how that would happen and what yellow car did they hit?? Then I noticed that the car wash has 2 yellow poles right in front of it......Lightbulb goes on, the poor pole has been hit so many times, you can see all the markings and paint scraped on it from the service guys hitting it with peoples cars. They had the nerve to blame me saying I brought it in like that.

I was warned by multiple friends that live in the area to avoid this place but i'm stubborn I guess.

A couple of weeks ago my wife and I went to inquire about buying out our lease, but we were told that we couldn't do to a big recall, OK fair enough, but we didn't want to get another car from there. We were hassled by the sales shark\guy to look at a new model which we said no thank you, then he proceeded to ask us to stay for hot dogs and drinks to which we politely declined and started walking away, when we were almost to our car he said well we have "Fried Chicken and Watermelon if you want!!". At the time I didn't think anything of it until I was down the street already, my wife said "did he just offer us Fried Chicken and watermelon?" I said yes he did. I was so close to turning around and going back to see if they actually had it so I could call his bluff. Being African American I was insulted at the petty attempt of a stereotype joke that it was best for him that I did not turn around. Instead they can take this car back and be done with me forever. Never again will I drop another dime here after I return this vehicle. BMW Valencia you should be ashamed.< /Review>

<gmapID>0x80c2876cc819b821:0xc72f3c4b40234881<//gmapID><review>Edit: We have since been compensated by the Manager and he felt genuinely concerned, so we have added one star back.

I really wanted this service to be great, but it has been so far from it. Problems started when we turned up to collect our brand new car and it hadn't even been washed. We think they washed the wrong one. So we had to wait about an hour for it to be prepared.

The handover was vague at best. We later found items in the car from BMW that said on them, "Your dealer will go through this check list with you when you collect your car". No. Promises of follow up on items that were not received disappeared with the wind requiring our follow up. Even the app for the car wouldn't connect to the car, and phoning their in-house "Genius" led to wild goose chases that resolved nothing. The "Genius" just didn't tell us that the app would not work for 72 hours.

Worse still the car itself had serious faults and would no longer work, requiring days on end with at least 2 loaner cars.

They did make concessions to make it up to us such as a free gift of a T-shirt and trunk cover, but even after meeting with the Manager, things did not improve. I received an email from the Manager promising follow-up... days later I've heard nothing from him.

One thing they are great about though is sending MULTIPLE survey requests. We've had over 10 from various departments. "We hope you are happy with your new BMW!" No, it cost $54,000 and it's in your shop having a new motor fitted. We are not happy. But after yet another survey request that I wanted to ignore, I give in. Here's the review you asked for.

Maybe we'll get our car back today and things will feel better, but right now I cannot recommend Valencia BMW to anyone.</review>< Rate>

I bought a BMW in January. It was a horrible car buying experience as the Sales managers made me feel unwelcome and like I was a burden. They said they weren't making any money on the deal but that doesn't excuse the poor customer service. They wouldn't even wash the car for me.

They committed fraud by saying that I was going to be placed with BMW Financial and then put me with a different Finance Company. So apparently they did make some money on the back end as well.

When I realized there were features in the car that weren't working like the online services or the SOS button, rather than replace or fix whatever needed to be done they said no and did not address my issues. Do not go here do not buy a car here go somewhere else.<//Text>

<Text>Worst service ever. Girls at help desk are rude. Phone rings forever no answer. Service advisor are trying to rip you off.

Managers will give you lip service and will blame anything and everything which is not covered by warranty and try to have you pay for it. No follow ups.
Don't waste your time and money at this  dealership.

I understand everyone can have a bad day, but the customer's are the one who are suffering.

I would rather buy a Kia or Hyundai and expect a better service than this dealership.

I don't know why Autonation is not doing anything to improve the service level of this dealship.

It's luxury brand and part of the payment for the car is to get spectacular services, after the purchase.

Believe Autonation doesn't get this.

Don't buy or get your car serviced at this dealership if you want to save time, money and unnecessary hassle.

Now I'm going trough BMW direct to get my issues resolved.

👎🏼 Worst dealership! Worst experience ever!

By the way don't call general manger or manager here is why:-
1- He will never have time or you will be notified that he is busy and you have to try some other time. They will give you a number which you will never ever get hold if anyone
2- If you got lucky and you do get a chance to talk to a manger, it will be a waste of time, as he will try to explain like he is pro and he know that the fault is either in you or in a part which is not covers by warranty. He will not try to understand you but try to get his point across.

Good luck!<//Text>< Pictures>

For a while I was looking at many cars including Audi and Lexus but Narek has helped me decide to get a BMW because he gave me the best car the best deal and was always there to answer any question or concern. So if anyone ever needs a car go to  Valencia BMW and ask for Narek because it is the best dealer and Narek will help you find what you were looking for a great deal and a great car.</review>

I bought a vehicle here at the beginning of November 2013. To keep things short and sweet I had nothing but a horrible time since the night I walked in there and made the purchase. First, always make sure you have acquired financing before leaving with the vehicle. I asked the salesman while my friend was with me multiple times about this and my concern with taking the car near closing on a Saturday evening. I was assured there were no issues after the credit check and within 3 days I was asked to pony up more cash for the deal to go through.  In the end it worked out, but please do not make my mistake. Verify with BMW Financial before you even get the seat and mirrors where you want them.

The night I purchased the car I also noticed some marks on the rear of the seats, bright red multiple locations. Since it has an Ivory interior it is definitely noticeable and the salesman asked if it would be possible to contact him during the week and setup an appointment to have this taken care of. I agreed since it was already closing time and believed him that this would be taken care of. A month has passed and nothing. No email response no phone calls returned.  This was also the theme when I was initially asked to put more down for the financing to work....no email response no phone calls returned until finally a resolution later in the week when I was contacted by the Finance Director. So if you could imagine selling your other vehicle the day after the purchase, only to find out there is a problem with financing....then no communication for days on where everything stands. I was a little on edge.

Last thing is when I received my plates from the DMV and prompted me to write this review. I went to install them and the front and rear nut plates were stripped down to nothing because the person that installed the dealer plates had used machine screws to hold everything in place. Front license plate holder was only being held in by one machine screw and another one just long enough to keep the entire bracket in place. What if this was your wife's brand new car and she had the kids with her driving down our already terrible So Cal roads, only to have a tire blow out by 3 inch long machine screws from a front license plate bracket that could not be held in place on your MSRP 63,000 vehicle.

Contacted BMW North America, though sympathetic even after sending pics, still nothing regarding a resolution. I will end up just paying an upholstery expert to help get the marks out. Found a way to rig the plates in place, "rig - To make or construct in haste or in a makeshift manner".

Also no email from either the dealer or BMW on my experience. I have heard this is a regular feedback requested from buyers by both parties.

Be cautious, I know a salesman will promise you the world to get you off the lot in one of their cars regardless of manufacture, but I did not expect this for my first and probably last BMW purchase.</text>

My experience at valencia BMW was great!! I Waited about 7 months for the car and Mazen (the sales rep) updated me at least twice a month! He was excellent to work with and highly recommend him as a salesman he is very straightforward and tells you his honest opinion. When the car finally arrived he called me and I went to pick it up the MSRP sticker did not match what the build was for, Mazen took this issue to the manager and they reduced it to the original order price. This was amazing, again I would highly recommend Valencia BMW to purchase a car BUT NOT to finance it. The sales rep Mazen gets 5stars out of 5. The finance person that I was sent to get the option contract gets 0 out of 0. The finance rep was terrible rude and disrespectful, he made me feel uncomfortable, upset and angry by the time I left. Mazen did such a great job that I do not want to take away from him he is amazing and I would recommend my family to him, but the finance person I dealt with afterward was one of the worst sales people I have ever encountered and would NEVER recommend him. He tried to sell me a maintenance plan for 5k when the car comes with one for free up to 36k miles and said it didn't Come with anything, he also tried to sell me an extended warranty for 7k and I got it later from my bank for $1500 (100k miles or 5 years including electric)but that's not the worst of it I know that's his job to sell that stuff, but we have the right to say NO, and the way he carried himself was the worst of it.  He was rude, arrogant and made me feel very uncomfortable and did not know how to take no for an answer but in a very disrespectful way, he said these exact words "I feel like my expertise is being disrespected right now" I said EXCUSE ME, I feel like me as the customer is being disrespected right now. All I wanted to do was get out of there I couldn't believe how he was acting if a customer says no it's no, he went on and on and literally was trying to make me feel stupid which is when I lost all respect for him. I am the customer you do not make me feel that way I don't deserve that. So again sales is great, Mazen is great, Finance was terrible and I would never recommend.<//text>

<review>We got our car from this dealership with no pressure and met professional sales and finance advisor personnel. I initially inquired for availability of my chosen car through email and Sergik Haftvani replied quickly on same day, met him the next day and I was impressed for his preparedness not only on the car but as well as introducing us with the sales advisor. He also personally discussed the car controls with my wife when nobody from their tech dept was around, talking about patience and flexibility. Gregg Nagel was our sales advisor who was very open and honest about the car pricing and financial estimates, again it was no pressure and very friendly at all times. While Gary Kazandjian the finance advisor was amazingly friendly, he discussed every detail of the document and offered services with no pressure. All of them provided us an experience in car buying that we have not encountered before, it is like shopping in the mall with leisure. My wife and I wished that all other dealership were like them, they have set a new standard in selling cars.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>Valencia BMW is a premier dealership. The staff on hand are very friendly. I'm always greeted when walking on the premises. This is my 3rd BMW 7 series purchase from Serjik. Serjik is an OUTSTANDING sales associate. His knowledge of BMW is amazing. He is very personable. He not there to just get a sale but there to give you a experience of a life time. If you're in the market for a new or used BMW, go to Valencia and see Serjik. I'm sure the other staff members are great to but I have had nothing but great experiences with Serjik. Thank you Valencia, you've earned a customer for LIFE!

Maryo Metry provided the best customer service I had in a long time. ASK for MARYO and you won't be disappointed! I am situated in the bay area but found my 435i xdrive fully loaded dream car in Valencia BMW. I gave them a call, and the rest is history. Maryo was awesome in communicating and helping me reserve the car before I get to test drive it the next week. The process with superb and pleasant. Will be recommending my friends to buy from him again!< /Review>

< review>
Consider this BEFORE you buy.  I purchased a BMW M6 convertable and my sister purchased me a small gift because she knew I liked the car so much.  She purchased an original BMW t-shirt from the accessories store in the dealership.  Nice present but it was one size too small.  I went to exchange for a larger size and waited at the parts counter while they ran the shirt thru their computer.  I had seen the EXACT shirt with the same tags on their shelf!  They said the shirt was not purchased at their dealership and would not make the exchange (Good call John Bernal parts manager).  Funny you have no problem taking my money to service my $130,000 car but you cannot exchange a $20 t-shirt.  Shame on you and your whole operation.<//review>

< Review>
I purchased a used 2012 335i sport line from this dealer last year from them. I bought the maintenance warranty for it since I know how expensive it is to maintain them.. Well the buying experience went pretty well and I paid 36k for it, it was an okay deal. So the salesperson urged me to leave a good review since I was obviously satisfied.  I decided to wait until I had the car for a year before posting about it. So here I am...

The car now has 54k miles and a whole lot of issues.. The passenger restraint system light is on and won't go away. I took the car to the dealer and charged me 1200 to fix it. Keep in mind the car has never been crashed and only a couple years old. Then they also told me I needed to replace the vaccuum seal and it would cost me an additional 2500k. What a surprise that was. I took it in for service prior to it having more than 50k miles (bmw warranty) and of course everything was working 100% . I called BmW directly and they told me because I barely passed the 50k mark that nothing was covered and i'de have to pay to fix the car.. So here I am letting all you guys know to beware. I own a 2016 m4 at the moment and guess what, I'm selling it at soon as I can break even.. Sorry BMW but I will no longer purchase any vehicles from you and neither will any of my coworkers as they have seen the lack of commitment to customer satisfaction you have provided. I wish you guys the best and hope someone is saved from making the horrible mistake I made.<//Review>

I had an excellent experience at Valencia BMW.  I went up just to look at a pre-owned Prius, and still received exceptional customer service.  I ended up purchasing the vehicle, which was in excellent condition, and they gave me a very good deal on the warranty.  Throughout the entire experience, I was impressed by the professionalism of the dealership, as well as the fact that it wasn't anything like the highly pushy sales tactics that had been used at Toyota dealerships I had visited previously.  Also, I would highly recommend making an appointment with Mazen Gharzeddine, one of the sales representatives.  I had a very pleasant experience, as he was very personable, , knowledgeable, efficient, and enthusiastic.  I would definitely come to this dealership again without hesitation.<//review>

Apparently one of their salesmen Armen failed to communicate with our DEAL.
We discussed on a set pricing for the car FOR OUT OF THE DOOR! But guess what? We ended up getting charged 150 dollars EXTRA because of our city sales tax is higher. Like the deal agreed upon, the extra sales tax are SUPPOSED to be handled within. But not in the final price. I DO NOT CARE IF OUR CITY TAX IS HIGHER OR NOT. A DEAL IS A DEAL.

Not like 150 dollars even matters. But this dealership proven itself to be absolute clueless in its management.

This review is going to be copy and pasted across all review websites.
Not like I even care about 150 dollars. But the moral of this is really really sad. And Armen as a sales person FAILED to communicate a refund with me even though I called/texted in the length of 2 days. It makes it sounds like customers are done with once they have sold the car.

Trust lost for this dealership. Beware to check all pricing before you sign anything. Because this dealership APPARENTLY seals documents into envelope before giving it to you! They do not even go over final numbers with you in purchase! Not until you go home, open the envelope to realize some numbers are OFF.

So many things went wrong. Just 1/5. It won't be changed.</Review>

<review>Had my 2007 328i towed into Valencia BMW for work. They had to replace the computer and the fuel pump needed a part because it kept popping off. After replacing the parts, they wrote on the invoice, "Car runs flawless" I drove 2 miles and the dang car cut off! Had to return it back to BMW. The next day they said it was a vacuum hose that was loose and they had to fix it. So my wife and I went to pick up our vehicle. Needless to say, we got on the freeway and it wouldn't go past 60 mph. We got right off and headed back to Valencia BMW. As we were stopped at the light, the car didn't do anything but shake like it was having a seizure. So now they say it was the Disa valve. So I had them replace it and the oil pan gasket. After a week, we pick up our vehicle and drive. As we get to the gas station, it wouldn't pump over half a tank of fuel before clicking off. I tried another gas station and the same thing happened. Not only can I NOT fill my tank with fuel, but the engine oil maintenance light comes on and it's showing that I need an oil change. It's also pausing as if it wants to cut off.

So I took it to Vic's Bimmer in Lancaster, CA to take a look at it. I told them what happened and they said they get a lot of complaints about Valencia BMW. They took the fuel pump off to check it and found the the vent hose was NOT connected. They connected it and ran a test. The test showed the DMTL pump was no good. So having them replace the pump, they found that the activated charcoal filter was full of fuel, so that had to be replaced too. So thanks for not correctly hooking my fuel pump back up, it caused these other parts to fail.

And here is the kicker!!! WHY would ANYBODY repairing my vehicle have a reason to go in the arm rest and look around? Not only did they go in my armrest, but they STOLE my damn iPod Classic with all my music on it. Major problem because Apple doesn't make that iPod anymore! So they wanted me to buy a new iPod and give them a receipt to refund me, but OH!!! They have to send it to Corporate to mail me a check that I still haven't received! I will NEVER take my vehicle to Valencia BMW again!! I don't even rate them as ONE star, but ZERO stars!!!!<//review>< gmapID>

I was looking for a 2013 535i in a specific color with a specific package. Valencia BMW had it...so I traveled  over an hour to see it. I Loved it! Unfortunately my husband was not there & by the time I decided I would buy it anyway the car was sold. Willi was very honest with me & told me someone else was also looking at it.  Sergik  & Willi new how much I liked the car and found me another one within a week!! Sergik sent me pictures & all the specs on the car. My husband & I drove down & made the purchase!!!  It was the best experience...No pressure at all! Not what you would expect when buying a car! Again Sergik was awesome and we will recommend him & Valencia BMW to everyone. It's worth the drive! Thank you again Sergik...I love my car!!👍🏼</Review>

I recently bought a used 2007 Miata from Valencia BMW.  My distrust of car salesman initially came out, and there was some miscommunication.  However, the people at Valencia BMW gained my trust pretty fast when we made the deal and I went down to get the car.

I really appreciated the way I was treated, and they even seemed to understand my sense of humor.  I took the car home.  My mechanics looked at the car a few days latter.  They found a radiator leak, and I was told it was covered under the 60 days warranty.  I have every reason to believe this will be taken care of.  I want to thank Polo, Aladin, Jim, Mickey and now Hiten for her follow up, and anyone else who was involved.   If you are looking for a BMW, or for what ever possible used car they may have at the time, I highly recommend Valencia BMW.<//Review>

Had an extensive email conversation with internet sales guy, he quoted me a price on a new car and I drove 45 min out to Valencia. Just as I am arriving he emails and says, "Computer got the price wrong, sorry for the confusion". Yeah to the tune of $4000! Disorganized and borderline dishonest, IMO. First and last experience with Valencia BMW.<//Text>

<text>This dealership, and in particular Rine Sanchez, defines what the internet buying experience should be. With most of the dealerships I dealt with, the internet department was just a cover up for the traditional car buying: playing games, forcing visits to the lot, infinite phone calls, etc. In contrast, Rine provided a firm quote after my first email communication, and subsequently updated it when the market conditions (i.e. incentives) changed. Once I agreed to the final offer, the entire purchase process (from stepping into the lot to leaving with the new car, including the test drive - with an already detailed car waiting me-) took less than 90 minutes.< /text><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

I called Valencia BMW on the 27th of October and spoke to Hiten Advani about a used car I was interested in on the lot.  He answered all of the questions I asked with complete truthfulness.  To me it was evident in his voice and demeanor.  I told him of my situation of being 4 hours north of Valencia and that I could not get there until the 29th a Saturday.  I explained that I would fly to Burbank and arrive at the airport at 9am and I asked what transportation was available to get to the dealership and if he could hold the car for me. He said he could hold for 48 hours with a bankcard deposit and offered to pick me up at the airport on his way to work.  What more could I ask for?  The deal was done!

I made my flight reservation and gave Hiten the flight number and used the bankcard hold system provided by the dealership.  We exchanged email & phone/text info.  I arrived on time in Burbank and texted Hiten immediately.  Walked out of the airport and he was there in minutes.  We both saw each other easily and were on our way to the dealership asap.

Upon arrival he drove me up to the vehicle and we checked it out visually and took a test drive.  All was exactly as described!  And I had met a true gentleman that I would recommend to anyone.  This man knows what he is doing and will help you meet your needs.  I will be back!  Thank you Hiten and Valencia BMW for having good people like him to help someone find their car.

However, upon walking into dealership, I was ignored by many salesman and receptionist. Honestly, feel that many judged me based on appearance that I could not afford a bmw.  To top it off, the finance guy referred to me as Bubba over and over while signing papers for purchase. The car was given to me with 1 key and no spare and finance guy simply walked off when asked. My experience at this place was horrid. The only highlight was my experience with Ritchie Spiers.</Text>< pictures>

Today I am very disappointed in the transaction that was made today.unfortunately I got in a car accident in Feb 2016 and totaled my Slk Mercedes which left me devastated. Since then I've been looking in different avenues to see if I can try a different type of car.I have been looking for 2 months and finally found a car I thought I'd be happy in. (I am very picky and particular) so I found a 2013 BMW Z4 28i s drive that I feel in love with which is smiliar to the Mercedes I had. Black exterior red interior . i found the  car on car gurus.I called them yesterday and spoke with buck like a dollar he says. I live all the way in N Fontana so my father asked if they can meet me half way. Thankfully they did and met me in city of industry. but before they came i specifically asked buck if the car was in great condition and if the car had any flaws on the inside and outside....   Because im picky i stated to him.he said everything was in tiptop condition and that they Wouldnt even allow a bmw to be certified if it was not in the best condition. he then called me back and did let me know the buttons were worn out but that if i go to any bmw they would replace it for free..so that made me a little hesitant but i still proceeded because i wanted this car and i figured if they replace it for free i loose nothing .Everything seems fine over the phone and I believed his confidence.we talked about numbers and the price was suitable for me.. He also mentioned that the gap was$9 and I should get it but ameer would go over that with me... so before they came to meet me I received a call from ameer and he went over the charges with me. He made it very discouraging to purchase the car, saying that it the maintenance is extremely expensive and that I should purchase the extended maintenance package... And that it was going to be $25 on top of the monthly payment.I informed him that I have a place where I take my car to and my family goes there, do I should be fine... He said "well u don't need him anymore because if your spending a lot of money like this you should be taking it to a BMW dealership and I'm sure he doesn't in fact work on newer BMWs , its rare " And he said that he recommends for people like"me" to purchase gap insurance which is $10.00 .
mmmmm. wait ...wait wait wait didn't buck say it was $9? (Red flag) and what ameer ment by people like me, is because I chose to put $0 down. Which was a little insulting. So I put it to his attention saying buck stated it was $9. He quickly stated that buck is not a licensed person to discuss details like that and said "oh , my mistake its actually $9.55, I was fifty cents off"... OK so I declined the packages he had to offer and he quickly typed up documents to me. Upon of their arrival I was a little agitated with the whole process but still happy to get my car, when the guy came I went out side happy and started to inspect the car, wow.... Are you kidding me? There is a huge dent in the front of the car... What a disappointment... I told the guy who brought the car to me,, is there any way they can fix it? He shrugged his hands in the air and said no.I also noticed that in the front bumper it was repainted for some reason and it was a horrible job. They also made it clear it was never in an accident , well why would they have to repaint it then? It wasn't even glossed right with smearing of the paint... Yes I'm a girl but I'm very knowledgeable about cars and paint jobs etc...it was spot on noticeable...he then called buck after 7 minutes of starring at me like are you going to take it or what?  And he said no that they were not going to put in the money for that. and that they could sell it to someone else... Mmmm okay... I guess it was a waste of time on both ends... Extremely bummed about everything.<//Review>

They had the car I wanted so I made the 90 minute trip to purchase the car from them. Gregg Hamilt was my sales rep. I won't bother to go into detail about signing the docs except top say that it was high pressure to buy additional useless packages and warranties. Seriously? A $2K+ tire/wheel warranty!?!?  Anyway, after that uncomfortable process Gregg walks me to the car and asks if I have any questions... I say what about a walkthrough of the features?  He says "Uhhh, all of our people are tied up.  Why don't you come back when you can schedule an appointment with one of our Geniuses?"  Seriously - I live 90 minutes away!! So I ask if he can at least connect my phone, he does so and says thanks.  Call back if you have any questions...  Wow, is it really that easy to become a GM of a BMW dealership, because whoever is running this place shouldn't have progressed any further than a car detailer.

This was definitely not like the experiences I've had when purchasing 3 other BMWs.  Yeah, I got a nice car, but I honestly feel that because I didn't buy any of their other up-sell packages, I was quickly escorted out of the dealership and "sent on my way".  Bad form.  Like I said, it has been over three weeks - I have not received a single phone call from ANYONE at the dealership to ask me if everything was OK with the car or if I needed any questions answered.  BMW - PLEASE SEND ME A SURVEY SO I CAN TELL SOMEONE THAT CARES JUST HOW BAD THESE GUYS ARE.<//text></record>

I've bought two BMWs from Valencia - one a certified pre-owned, and the other a new X5. In both cases I was struck by the high level of professionalism of the sales staff, as well as of the support executives, from Finance (fantastic) to service (knowledgable and fair). My first purchase was with Brandon, who has since been bumped up to finance, but he took care of me like a friend. My second purchase with with "Jim" Hiten Advani, probably the most cultured and knowledgeable luxury car salesman I've met anywhere (turns out he sold luxury cars to oil millionaires in Kuwait before settling in Cali. Then, the most dreaded part of the typical buying experience is the time spent in Finance. A great guy name Mickey Williams took the extra time to understand my personal finances, which were a little complicated due to self employment, and he saved me a point on the great BMW interest rate by pointing out what I'd done wrong in filling out my financing forms. So I hope this doesn't sound too good to be true, but I left Valencia BMW amazed by the quality of the staff they'd assembled there, and by the real sense of comraderie that I felt during the car selection and buying process. I give this dealership and its folks five big stars!<//Text><Response>None<//Response></record>

Orson and Polo (Sales), and the finance guy (dont have name) were great to work with. No high pressure to purchase an "option package" during the paperwork process (as is custom at dealerships) although they are available. In and out of paperwork and the dealership which is what I value the most (my time). This BMW is my second from Polo and the group there at Valencia BMW (2016 and now a 2018).< /Review>

Well I was little busy and didnt got a chance in writing this review, but finally here I go. This is for Gregg Hamitt, he is better than the best out there. I was looking for a BMW X3 with specific combination of packages. After talking to few dealers nearby I came in contact with Gregg. I gave him my requirements and man he right away placed a custom order for me without any upcharge/deposit. Gregg gave me the best deal on my car which no other dealer in entire So Cal was able to match. Even though I live in Buena Park, CA it was worth driving all the way up to Valencia BMW near Magic mountain which is 60 miles away from my place. Gregg kept me posted throughout the build of my X3, it took about 4 weeks for the car to arrive from factory. Once my car arrived Gregg contacted me, I made an appointment and he made sure my car was ready to go. We had to just wait to work with finance manager Brandon Barsh and off we go in our brand new custom ordered X3. Brandon was good to work with, he didn’t tried to oversell the warranty and coverage, he made sure we had the right coverage. The entire transaction was smooth. And the final surprise, Gregg helped us to get another BMW factory rebate on the day we got the delivery of our car. I will definitely recommend Gregg and Valencia BMW to anyone who is looking for a BMW.< /review>

I have been shopping for a new "fun" car for some time and ran thru the whole gamut of sport / luxury sedans.  After driving various cars, and a number of BMW models, I decided that I wanted a new or very low mile 550i.

I had previously visited Valencia BMW in the past 6 months when casually looking at several other cars, and both of my previous visits had been pleasant and stress free.  So, after shopping and driving a couple local dealers near my home in Ventura, I went out to visit Valencia BMW.

The salesman I worked with, Robert Grass, a longtime BMW enthusiast, was professional, upbeat and very knowledgeable.  He found a perfect used 2014 550i for me with very low miles, gave an excellent overview of the car and after taking a drive, we worked out our deal.  They were very efficient and having shopped around considerably, they were both easy to deal with and competitively priced. I could not have been happier with the car and after filling out a credit application and various paperwork, was quickly moved into their Finance office.

The Finance director, Amir Mansour, was a pleasure to work with as well.  He was fast with all of the DMV paperwork and it was easy to see why he had been with the company for 15 years as he was very good at his job. On the way out, I was introduced to Mr. Gary Pilikyan, the General Manager.  He was a very nice man and I complimented him on how well run and professional his store was.

After I had taken delivery of the car, another gentleman spent about 25 minutes teaching me about all the technology (I am a first time BMW owner) and making sure I was comfortable with leaving in my new vehicle.  And finally, they confirmed my home address so that they could have my SUV dropped off at my house the next day, which eliminated me having to drive back with someone to get it.

In summary, I was floored by the professionalism and courtesy I experienced from Valencia BMW.  I do not casually give out glowing recommendations so I can promise you this, they absolutely earned all of the accolades I'm giving them.

And needless to say, I plan to come back and buy more cars from them in the future..<//review>

I leased a 2015 BMW 328i from Valencia BMW and after approximately the first 2,000 miles I started getting a Lamp Malfunction error and this has continued to happen approximately every 2,000 to 3,000 miles. I 've had to take this vehicle in at least 7 -8 times for this problem!
The problem that is frustrating is that BMW service advisors didn't do anything to resolve the issue until I made an issue of the problem!
Now I'm having a problem with the check engine light on and BMW is telling me that the parts are on backorder and it will be 30 days before they can repair the problem! This is absolutely absurd! I have to pay for a vehicle that I'm uncomfortable driving!
I am very disappointed in Valencia BMW and I will never purchase or lease another BMW from them! Buyers Beware!!!< /Review>

I had a terrible experience at this dealership. It was my first time bringing in my x3 at this location for an oil change and to fix a recall. First of all, my appointment was at 4:40pm and my name was not called until 5:30pm. I looked at the sign-in sheet and the guy that had a 5pm appointment got called first even if we got there the same time. Regardless of the appointment time, they call the name who is next on the sign-in sheet. That is not how it works. When I picked up my car 2 days after(promised the next day), my cologne was missing in the glove compartment. The people are shady here and their customer service is sub par for a luxury car dealership. I will never return to this place again.< /Text>

i just recently bought a bmw 750 from valencia bmw.they advertised the car as a certified pre owned  unit.that means it has higher standards before being sold.so after 7 hours of being in financing i sign a deal and they come back and say it didnt go through because the car is was cpo in the past not at the current time.they asured me it met cpo standards but the rate will go up from 5% to 7 somthing % .i was tired of being at the delear ship and just signed.i figured ill refinance later and the car met cpo standards so im good.after a couple weeks my manager at glendale nissan noticed low tread.i checked and they were at 2/32nds.im a service advisor so i know thats an unsafe tread zone.we recommend replacing tires at 3/32nds.i had one of my technicians do a multipoint inspection where he confirmed 2/3nds tires in rear.both lower control arms broken.all rotors warped/glazed and grooved needing to be replaced.my rear brakes where at 3mm needing to be replaced.my rear window shade motor is burned out and the shade gets stuck up.and in the system since i bought it.its been saying i need to change my brake fluid.so when i was working the deal they said there was no room in the deal because it cost 1200 to cpo the car.i called and asked my salesman for help.he said he couldnt do anything.he said the car was so cheap because it went to the line like that.first he says the car got cpo so theres no room in the deal then says it was so cheap because they didnt fix the car before it hit the line.regardless whats right is whats right.they didnt offer to do anything for me.and said tough luck.at my last 3 dealerships ive worked for we step up and help the customer if theres problems.ive seen sales lose money to make a customer happy because they care and know what word of mouth can do.its a shame i buy a higher end car and get treated worse than somone that buys an 8000 dollar used car and complains about everything thats not brand new.i will make sure that none of my friends,family,coworkers and people that i do business with never go to valencia bmw because of their bad business practices.i waited before reviewing to see if they would at least call back and try to help.i have money so i dont need their help,i just wanted to see if they would do whats right and they failed.my names dean conkling.thank you for your time<//Text>

Just leased a new 2015 BMW 328i last night and had to return to the dealership the next day and have it serviced as the center console buttons are not working (DSC button, Sport & Eco mode buttons). Not expecting this from a luxury European car. Also very bad customer service from this dealership. I have to walk around and wait like an idiot at the service area with no one asking if I needed help. Big difference when I go to Audi Keyes at Van Nuys for service.< /Review>

I absolutely LOVEEEEEEEEEEE! This dealership Willie Dalgan was my salesman, and he did an phenomal job on my deal. I'm all of the way in Memphis,T.N., and he gave me a great price on my 2014 428i drive coupe bmw, and shipped it to me for a GREAT PRICE. I received a great APR, and everything that, I wanted willie made sure that, I received it PROMPTLY. This car dealership in Valencia, CA is the best everyone expedited my car deal within days, and I couldn't have went to a better dealership for my FIRST BMW! I wouldn't have even did it in my own city in Memphis lol TO BE HONEST! If you guys are looking for a great deal, a nice vehicle, and wonderful dealership to handle your deal. CONTACT WILLIE DALGAN, AND I PROMISE YOU WILL THANK ME LATER! I am happy, blessed, and so excited that, I found them. THANKS VALENICA OF BMW! I FREAKING LOVE THE ENTIRE STAFF!< /review>

My husband and I purchased a 335i GT last Thursday after having email and phone correspondence with Lillian. I am very happy with my car and my experience with Lillian, whom I can describe as one of the most sincerest, down to earth car salesperson I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. We actually walked away from several dealerships (BMW, Lexus to be exact, in Orange County) during the previous week before finding Lilli. Those salesmen were arrogant and unwilling to work within our budget; literally telling us to accept their MSRP price or forget it. We already had our financing and minds made up as to what we wanted and Lilli worked hard to stay in touch and find the car within our budget. In fact, she exceeded our expectations on the day we came to purchase.
I highly recommend Lillian Rodriquez as someone who will work hard for you with honesty and integrity. I have already told many friends and family members about her and this dealership.< /text>

<Review>Buyer beware.  As a customer, I'm writing this review as a warning other potential customers.  My 2007 BMW was purchased July 2011 with 60,000 miles as a certified pre owned.  2 months into this car, the hoses on the radiator needed to be replaced. On the 3rd month, the car was consuming 4-5 quarts of oil after a oil change.  I was told by the service writer "BMW's are known for needing about a quart of oil at times you fill your tank with gas." Really?  After a month of complaining to them, they serviced the car and found it was a bad gasket on the oil filter.  Within 5 months of having this car, it was not holding a battery charge and I was getting a error message, "Battery Depleted". The not so wonderful service writers response was, "BMW's battery's need to be charged with a battery tender every night, even if you drive the car  70 miles a day.  And I can sell you one for $70."  At this point I lost all trust in my service writer and took my car to another shop and they tested the battery and told me it needed to be replaced.  I then took my car back to BMW of Valencia and spoke only with the service manager.  They tested the battery and replaced.  A few months latter, the tires were not holding air.  I took the car in for services for a oil change and to check the tires.  I was told by the service writter, "when the tire tread gets low the air will leak out and I needed new tires.  And I can sell you them , with a alinement at $2400."  The price so high since I was told I dont have a spare tire.  Guess what? This car does have a spare.  I bought new tires at another place, starting to loose all trust in this dealership.  Then a few months after, the car was consuming a lot of oil again, the new services writer came up with another lame excuse and released the car to me. Jumping to just a few months ago, I was checking the fluids on the BMW and found a great loss of oil and oil sludge in the coolant.  I took the car back to the dealership and spoke with a new service manager.  They checked the car and replaced the radiator and the water pump and said their is now issue with the oil and engine.  I also had them check the tires and wheels and, as they were still not holding air and was told by the service manager "3 of the 4 wheels have cracks in them and this is a road hazard not covered, you must have hit a pot hole."  I spoke with the general manager and asked him to replace the wheels and honor the warranty until 100,000 miles after all I have been through with this dealership, but was denied.  The general manager said "I will sell you some new wheels and a extended warranty at a discounted price."  I have not heard back from him and have left messages for 2 weeks straight.  This is the last place you would want to do business with.  Pre owned certified to them, means the car was washed by the previous owner when it was turned in.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>Took our X3 in for recall work and had it returned with damage to the exterior paint.  To their credit, Valencia BMW took the car to fix the problem without question.  I received a call that the repair work had been done and that the car was washed and ready for pickup.  Unfortunately there was over-spray on the a good portion of the car including the windows.  We left the car there another day to have that problem taken care of.  After being called and notified that it was again "ready" to be picked up found that there was still over spray on the windows.  Not wanting to continue the fiasco, I drove it to a car detailer and had them take care of the problem once and for all. This all took place while we were in the process of selling the X3 and needless to say, Valencia BMW was not on our list of dealers where we looked for a new car.< /text><user_id>117740934436019377085<//user_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

< review>
My fiancé had an oil change appointment at 9:30 a.m. for her 2016 X3. She is still waiting for it to be completed at 2:00 p.m. She was then asked if she could just pick it up tomorrow. I tried to share my concerns about the delay, but was told the Service Manager, Andy Cicero, took the day off. Kind of unfortunate, considering how poorly the place is being run. We won't be back.< /review>

THE WORST SERVICE EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!  If you are able to check your car in less than an hour consider yourself lucky.  I was attended once by Alen Yadegar, who was very nice and professional.  But it almost took an hour from the time I got in there to the time I actually spoke with him.  If you go there and write your name on the list of customers arriving,  DON'T RELY ON THEM TO CALL YOU, OR YOU MIGHT SIT THERE FOR HOURS.  Be sure you check in with the cashier sporadically OR YOU MIGHT SIT THERE FOR HOURS.  If you have a few hours to kill just to check your car in for service, go to this dealership...THEY WILL HAVE OLD NASTY COFFEE IN A WAITING AREA THAT IS FAR FROM THE CHECK IN DESK.  If you are lucky to hear when they call your name AFTER AN HOUR, consider yourself lucky.  IF YOU HAVE A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SPEND AND GET THE WORST TREATMENT EVER, GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP.</Text>

< review>
A good but not really awesome experience to give 3 stars.  Gregg is a great guy and deserves words of praise. Awarding 3 stars only because of Gregg and the Finance team, else I was inclined to give them 2.5 stars. Sales personnel other than Gregg need to do a much much better job and listen to customers who may come in to buy either a brand new vehicle or an used vehicle. Complains regarding key malfunction were not addressed within 48 hours of purchase. It was only when Gregg returned from his days off , I was given a reply. In Gregg's absence I had to speak to the manager who did not help me out. I believe it is the responsibility of the dealership to care for their customers whether they buy an used car or a new car. When Gregg was away, the sales personnel who handed the car keys , did not even bother to respond to customer's complaints.<//review>

Three times now I have ordered parts, and three times now they have FAILED to call me when the parts come in. So make sure you follow up with phone calls.< /Review>

We had to have a few things done, and it was the day after Thanksgiving. The service department was busy, so we got a free BMW coupes rental until they were done. About 5 hours total. I'm not used to getting a rental, but that may be typical for BMW.< /review>
