We had our wedding at Twenty Mile House this year and could not be more happy with the beautiful venue and amazing staff!
Rachel and her staff are the best, they take care of all the details and make the whole wedding planning process so stress free and easy!  They are a pleasure to work with!
I highly recommend Twenty Mile House venue to anyone planning their special day!<//Review>

Twenty Mile House was the absolute best wedding venue for our special day! Aside from the breathtaking venue in the mountains of Plumas County, the site is filled with pockets of nature among historic buildings with a rustic yet elegant feel for you and your guests to enjoy.  Our party spent the weekend at Twenty Mile House. We enjoyed our rehearsal dinner with full catering, staff, bartender, and of course the spectacular coordinator who walked us through the ceremony.  On our wedding day the staff, coordinator, florist, caterers, and photographer were all incredibly helpful and professional. Our wedding was absolutely magical thanks to the Twenty Mile House team! My husband and I would not have had such a wonderful wedding without the professional, kind, and attentive staff that Twenty Mile House provided. We had the wedding of our dreams thanks to Twenty Mile House!

<review>DO NOT BOOK THIS VENUE

So glad I’ve had two friends stop their plan to move forward with this venue. Their reviews will be tanking very soon when everyone catches wind of their unprofessional and unhealthy scam tactics.

They are basically forcing people to host weddings THEIR WAY (AGAINST CDC GUIDELINES) or pay thousands to postpone (WITHOUT ANY COVID PROTECTION) if this is still ongoing next year.

They expect guests of all age groups to share cabins with multiple households. They offer to host a wedding but there can be no dancing or hugging!

Basically - they’re stuck in a lousy economy and plan on taking their customers down with them. So lousy and sad to see! The fact that they would be willing to put people at risk to collect their money is so against what other venues are doing. They’re completely off the rail of doing the right thing! For crying out loud gyms are reimbursing... no excuse! Pure greed and not the way to recover from a recession.</review>< user_name>

What a year this has been trying to plan our wedding. It has been a very stressful decision trying to work out the best way to approach our 2020 wedding. Our venue the Twenty Mile House couldn't have been more understanding and helpful in providing advice and flexibility in coming up with the decision that is best for us and our situation. They provided us with many options and were happy to talk with us on multiple occasions  as we worked through how best to proceed. In the end we decided to reschedule to 2021. We are so looking forward to our wedding there next year!<//Review>

They took care of everything so I had little to nothing to worry about. The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking with views of the mountains, a nearby river, train tracks and forest trees. Cabins on site that accommodated my entire wedding party, plus some.
Every vendor who is partnered with TMH was amazing to work with! Quick to respond, very friendly, and the best part is they all have worked together for years so they knew how to make sure our day ran smoothly and perfectly.  If you are looking for an all-inclusive wedding venue, TMH is the best decision you will ever make. I am so happy with our decision to get married there. They went above and beyond our expectations, and because of them we had the wedding of our dreams. Worth EVERY penny!!!< /review>< pics>

I really can't say enough regarding Twenty Mile House and our roller coaster of a ride during this wedding pandemic planning....

Rachel Mann has been terrific during this whole process from start to finish!  Clearly not an easy seat she sits in right now, especially with the property located in CA.

As a retired event planner myself, I could not have more pleased with her constant communication regarding all phases of our daughters wedding.  From vendor recommendations to rooming accommodations the process was EASY.  The property is stunning and what a great destination location.  Makes for one hell of a party!

Obviously we had to shift around on some things but at the end of the day it's exactly what we envisioned.  Beautiful, stunning, fun and fun!

Thank you Twenty!<//Text>

<text>Perfection! From the moment we stepped foot on the premises, the entire Twenty Mile House staff made us and each one of our guests feel welcome. The small things…The staff made sure we had a chance to catch our breadth, take in the moment, and double-checked that the bride & groom’s glasses and plates were always full. When the day flies by in the blink of an eye, the smallest things can make a difference and are quite memorable. They ensured all the little details we wanted on our special day were executed and ready to go.

TMH offers a truly unique environment made for a storybook wedding. Having an all-inclusive venue made planning a breeze, especially during pandemic times, we really appreciated the ease of logistics among TMH and its vendors. TMH offers a comprehensive and straight forward guide to planning your dream wedding and it covers all the details you could possibly need. All the vendors TMH partner’s with are absolutely incredible! Choosing vendors who are familiar with TMH’s terrain makes a huge difference as they are able to make the best decisions and recommendations in a moment’s notice. Every vendor is extremely friendly and highly responsive. Our guests instantly raved about the food and dessert - Southern Accent Catering and Grandma Janes Place made things easy as they each offer an assortment of delicious options. I did not give much direction on the flowers, but Gray’s Flower Garden hit it out of the park and the final product was perfect! Whether you are the type of person to get into the nitty gritty about details or just want to focus on the bigger picture, Twenty Mile House pairs well with any couple.

We recommend Twenty Mile House to any couple looking for an incredibly unique wedding with easy and guided planning without the need to hire an additional wedding planner. TMH was instantly a home away from home. One regret is wishing we spent more than one night at the venue. We only booked the venue for the wedding night and we didn’t have enough time to soak in all the beauty TMH has to offer with our friends and family. Planning a return anniversary trip is definitely on our bucket list! Major kudos to Rachel Mann, Penny, and Lenny for creating such a memorable wedding day for us!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>BEYOND IMPRESSED!
We think it’s fair to say that planning a wedding is one of the more stressful and trying things that a couple may go through. But once that day arrives and the hard work falls behind you, and all you’re left to do is stand in-front of your best friend and say “I do,” you realize every bit of it was worth it… that for some odd reason... you want to go through it all over again. Which leads us to why the Twenty Mile House and its staff and vendors were beyond impressive!

First things first… Rachel Mann. Our Coordinator, our advisor, our trusted leader through the wedding planning process. She simply made it easy. Her creativity, outstanding communication, firm guidance, organized file-sharing system, and overall calm, cool, and collected attitude on the wedding day, made us feel at ease. We knew if we forgot something, that Rachel had us covered. It’s the comfort she created that alleviated the stresses and permitted us to enjoy “our day.”

The Twenty Mile House is a truly magical place… especially at night when the moon and stars come out, the lights turn on, and then a 10-ton train comes barreling down the tracks, commemorating your moment with a blow of the horn. It’s the little (and big) touches around the venue that make all of the difference in the world. It’s having your dearest friends and family staying on-site with you for the entire weekend. It’s the friendly staff stopping to take a moment to say “good morning” and see how your day was going. It’s that feeling of appreciation you have for the people working tirelessly to setup and breakdown the ceremony and reception site, the bar and coffee stands, or to do the groundskeeping. It really is the people, combined with this beautiful site, that make it an amazing wedding venue.

One highlight for us was getting to attend the Wedding Fair. Wow, we had no clue when we picked the TMH that we would have so many vendor options! We were able to sample food by local caterers, listen to music from talented DJs and guitarists, preview table layouts and settings including floral displays, meet photographer/videographer teams, and spend a nice day walking the grounds and envisioning where things would go and how it may look on our day. We got married roughly 10 months after the Fair, but having had the chance to make many decisions early-on, especially on-site at the venue, allowed us to put together what we would say was a perfect day.

We would like to thank everyone involved:
The Twenty Mile House and its entire Staff
Rachel Mann - Wedding Coordinator
Southern Accent - Rehearsal Dinner Taco Bar
Pangaea Catering - Wedding Reception Dinner
Quincy Cooking - Dessert Bar & Cake, plus “morning-of” Breakfast
Lion Smile Entertainment - Todd the DJ
Andrew Ohren - Acoustic Guitarist
Weddings by Gray - Flowers
Kay & Derek Kroshus - Photography and Video

We highly recommend the Twenty Mile House to anyone looking to have a beautiful, outdoor forest wedding in Northern California. You will not regret it.

We recently got married at Twenty Mile House on 6/28/18. I (a legit bridezilla) tend to panic over small things. Rachel Mann (coordinator) kept me sane with her promptness and her professionalism. They took care of us and made sure they understood our wedding vision. The all-inclusive nature of the venue was what made it very smooth during the planning process. Overall, you get what you pay for, and more. Get ready to hear "wow" reactions from your guests!<//text>

<name>Emily Obenshain<//name><Date>1539023345617<//Date><rating>5< /rating><text>Every time we think about our wedding, we both smile from ear to ear. It was absolutely phenomenal & we could not be more grateful  for Rachel Mann. She is the best wedding coordinator & helped make our entire weekend flawless. Rachel is incredibly knowledgeable, provided us the best support and answered the endless questions we had, in a timely manner. When we needed guidance, she provided suggestions and options, while clearly keeping our vision in mind.  When our families met her at our rehearsal, they were very impressed with her professionalism, attention to detail, and ability to calmly instill trust.  We were able to be fully present in our special day because we knew she had everything under control.
All of the vendors we worked with matched this same level of professionalism and dedication. The best thing we did was trust their suggestions and input, they truly are the experts. Holly, with Pangaea, worked with us to create a diverse and personalized rehearsal dinner and reception menu for the weekend. Her food is absolutely delicious, her staff is very friendly. Our guests raved about both meals- we are so happy we worked with Holly.  Sonia, with Weddings by Grays, produced  elegant flower arrangements that enhanced the natural beauty of TMH.  She understood the look we were going for and the end results were perfect. Mauve is a tricky color to work with and Sonia was able to create a look we was so proud of- and the alter fabric she hung was dreamy.  She had all of the details down, from the location of petals down the aisle, to the asymmetrical design on the arch.  Connie with Quincy Cooking Cottage provided us with a variety of options for our dessert table. She produced a beautiful and delicious spread of desserts, with brownies, personal fruit tarts and the best lemon bars we've ever tried. Our two tier cake was elegant and we are so excited to eat the top tier on our one year anniversary next summer. Our bar service was wonderful- we offered a full, open bar, with beer, wine, liquor and kegs from The Brewing Lair.  The service was executed perfectly, there was never a line or an empty glass. Jason was fun and engaged with our guests, and stayed late after our rehearsal dinner to set up the fire pit for us all to enjoy.  His fun, lighthearted personality made guests feel welcome.  For music, we worked with Andrew Ohren who played acoustic guitar while guests arrived and for all of our ceremony music. He is so talented and the live music really created the ambiance we were hoping for. Our guests commented how beautiful it was to arrive to venue and hear him welcoming them. He provided helpful guidance when helping us plan, and you could tell he enjoys what he does.  Todd, with Lionsmile Entertainment, DJ’d the rest of our day and he did an outstanding job. He was so much fun to work with, and you could feel he loves what he does. He read the crowd well, played based on their responses and helped create the perfect setting. In our reception pics the dance floor is always packed. Todd did a wonderful job in bringing our family and friends together to celebrate our love.  From start to finish TMH is perfect. Everyone was truly dedicated to making our wedding day the most special it could be.  We are so thankful to be able to look back on this once in a lifetime event and have nothing but wonderful memories.< /text>< pics>

<review>Having our wedding at Twenty Mile House was nothing short of magical. The venue itself is absolutely stunning and every vendor we worked with only made it look more gorgeous. Every vendor that works with Twenty Mile House knows the venue so well and because of that they knew how to make my vision fit perfectly with the venue. They were easy to connect with and great about keeping in touch for all the changes and alterations we made to our plans, menus, music list, etc. Their florist really blew me away with the arrangements she made and the photographer was a blast and already knew all of the best photo areas and best timing. The DJ was gave us a great vibe for each part of the evening, and all of the food was incredible. The caterer was so sweet, she even, unprompted, went the extra mile and made gluten free pancakes for our brunch because she knew I had a guest with celiacs. Rachel and the staff were professional, personable and truly enjoyable to work with. They seem like they genuinely  enjoy their job. They kept everything running smoothly and made it the easiest, most enjoyable weekend my husband and I have ever had. I can’t say enough for this spot! Thank you so much Twenty Mile House, it couldn’t have been any better!!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>The Twenty Mile House (TMH) is an amazing and magical, location, venue, and team! The decision to work with TMH to share our wedding vision was a no brainer, we had to book with them!

When we first stepped onto the property, Rachel (the Wedding Coordinator) was friendly and listened to what we were looking for. We got a tour of the three beautiful ceremony locations, and they are ALL breathtaking! The vendors we chose that TMH had in their catalog, are ROCKSTARS (Southern Accent, The Cake Studio, Gray's Flower Garden, Wildsmile Entertainment)! Even vendors that TMH didn't have in their catalog, but had recommended (Composing Reality, 32 Degrees Media) are professional and awesome! TMH has an amazing wedding fair where their catalog vendors,  recommended vendors, and new vendors can showcase their work. There are so many amazing OPTIONS! We met Talia Koval (Live Painting), and we knew had to work with her. My Wife follows them on Instagram and found out that Petite Street Mobile Bar previously got married at TMH, and we wanted to work with them! Rachel was very accommodating to work with them. We could not believe how perfect ALL of the vendors worked together!

TMH is so accommodating and makes everything feel stressless, painless, easy, and seamless! They are very organized and work with online worksheets that can be viewed and worked on by all parties. They are easy to call, text, or email if you need to get a hold of them, and reply very quickly. They do all the setup and tear down of all decor. They have a great list of decorations, linen, etc, that will make your wedding vision come to life!. All of their staff are friendly, amazing, and make sure everything is perfect.

We can't rate Twenty Mile House more than what we're allowed to! You and your guests on your wedding day will be in awe when they arrive! We're considering (more than likely) doing vow renewals here in the future!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9fiAMa_VW0jNIvCmJVTyxpxaVvXmWcG8wqob5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLe8fKvGHST0tOO7lCqXVqpQakrNqR9z52_gJJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOttd7EnF0wYFHgjPj5sC2rrFOc6PmIibjkiz3j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjtCnB94yMe-pHjdKeGS46y0Gz7I3RRvwVO46Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmiIGNcRSriMCIXr8XE1Y_xmmM_tfUK8kzLwYS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeSdna3LQtLpTndScZ-ZoAQ9QuXYLJFnB7MUzD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x809c433c10093407:0x89b6f78bf4559116< /Gmap_id></record>

Absolutely extraordinary! If you’re looking for a beautiful wedding venue, a professional staff, amazing food, outstanding customer service, and a stress free experience, then the Twenty Mile House is for you. Rachel was a first class wedding coordinator. Her professionalism and courtesy was impressive. Southern Accent provided the perfect home made food. Sonia the florist put together beautiful arrangements while Grandma Jans baked delicious desserts. Composing Reality captured our special day and provided us with beautiful photography. The DJ kept guests dancing all night. This all inclusive wedding venue is top notch! Rachel and all the Twenty Mile House staff helped make our dream wedding come to life!!!!  Top wedding venue by far!</review>

We are almost one month into married life and we continue to relive our PERFECT wedding at the Twenty Mile House! We fell in love with the property when we saw the forest ceremony site and learned about the option to float the river that runs through the property! However what truly sold us on the venue was the coordinator Rachel!!! We needed someone we could trust as we live in Southern CA. Little did we know just how much we would need to trust her when a global pandemic hit just months before our big day! Here is a rundown of our vendors:
Catering: Southern Accent- Kent and Adrienne were SO KIND and accommodating! All of our guests raved about the food and were big fans of the last night pizza. We also hired them to cater our rehearsal dinner. They were so attentive and even joined us on the dance floor for a few songs!
Dessert: Grandma Jane's- Kimberly and her daughter nailed every dessert! We did a cutting cake (best cake I've ever had) mini cupcakes, mini pies, and mini cheesecake bites. They nailed the maple donut cupcake and the lace design on the cutting cake I had asked for was beautiful!
Florals: Gray's Florals- Sonia is a true artist! I envisioned neutral flowers and pampas grass complemented by copper and mercury glass accents. She nailed everything and was able to swap out a bridesmaid bouquet for additional florals only days before the wedding. We gave her lots of freedom in terms of specific florals which allowed her to work her magic and nail our vision!
DJ Jon: He was a fill in for the planned DJ but he was awesome! He had people dancing all night long and even stayed a bit extra to let the party continue. He had great energy and was a wedding guest favorite!
Bar: The drinks were tasty and Joseph and staff did not stop working the entire night! They even left drinks out for us once the staff left at midnight. A perk of TMH is no noise ordinance so we were up till almost 3am!
We sourced photo and video separately and they NAILED it! I will write separate reviews but 32 Degree Media and Taylor McCutchan are the best in their craft! These were #1 on my priority list behind a stunning ceremony site as they allow you to relieve every detail. We received our teaser and previews for both within weeks (photo we had the very next day!!) and we couldn't be happier!
Coordinator/ Staff: Rachel and the TMH staff work non-stop to make your vision come true. We stayed on property Thursday till Sunday and every detail was taken care of from sun up to sun down! We could not have asked for a better coordinator than Rachel. She was organized, calm, accommodating, and FUN! She hyped us up for the big weekend but kept us calm as we navigated the unexpected challenges of COVID.
One piece of advice when planning any wedding at any venue is to understand your contracts with all vendors. Understand how situations like COVID (is there even something similar to this?!) or other unpredictables impact your date/ planning process. Our wedding process was so SMOOTH until COVID which was uncharted territory for everyone. Nonetheless, with Rachel at the wheel and the great vendors that work with TMH, our wedding weekend came together perfectly and safely!< /review>

Where do I even begin? Our experience with Twenty Mile House was incredible. The grounds are so peaceful and fun to explore. The whole crew (special shout out to Rachel who is amazingly organized and chill) and their vendors (shout to Composing Reality, Southern Accent, Grandma Jane’s Place, and Sonia Grays Flowers, y’all are the best people) were such a dream to work with. They honored our vision and executed it beautifully. Throughout the planning process, they were responsive, reassuring, and flexible. When the wedding weekend came around, it went so smoothly and was everything we dreamed of. Because of all the staff support, we were able to spend time with our guests and enjoy the joyous occasion. If we had to do it all over again, we wouldn’t change a thing.< /review>

<Text>Twenty Mile House was the most amazing wedding venue I could’ve ever asked for. They helped make sure that our big day was everything we wanted and more. The all inclusive venue was well worth the stress free planning. If I could give this venue infinite stars, I would. If your on the fence about booking this venue, schedule a tour and see the beautiful venue for yourself. I would not change a single thing about our wedding day and we will forever cherish our time with Twenty Mile House.< /Text>< date>

<Text>TMH, Rachel, and the staff were exceptional for our wedding. Rachel made the planning seamless and painless for us throughout the entire process! The venue itself is so beautiful and was the perfect spot for our friends and family to celebrate our wedding. The vendors are very accommodating and worked with us every step of the way. The staff did a great job of making sure our stay was quality, and they did a great job setting up and tearing down as well. Plenty of space at the reception for dancing and partying and the dinner set up is a beautiful sight to see.
We highly recommend TMH and working with Rachel for any future newlyweds!<//Text>< user_name>

I can't say enough incredible things about Twenty Mile House. I'm a wedding photographer, so I'm constantly at venues and Twenty Mile House is the unicorn of venues around this area. Very unique and filled with character around every corner! I'm always stoked to go back. The team is also incredible!< /review>

Gorgeous cabins with lots of rooms for guests, fully furnished kitchen, hot tub, multiple grills, lawn games, a river to float, fire pits, dance stage, private bar, and much much more.  When we first started to realize how much was needed to plan a wedding we felt extremely overwhelmed and honestly put a lot of things off for a while but even with this delay, twently mile house made our dream wedding come true. Rachel, the planner was absolutely amazing. She was flexible with meet up dates and answered all emails in a timely manner. Even when Rachel went on a short vacation another staff member promptly returned my email and answered my question. Most helpful of all though was Rachel's friendly, calm, confident and reassuring attitude towards the mountain of planning that helped us stay focused and know that we were making progress.  During the day of our wedding  all of the twently mile house staff worked tirelessly to take care of absolutely everything without prompting. All staff were friendly and helpful if asked of anything extra and always had a smile on their faces.  All in all, it truly was a stress free day were we and all our guests could soak up every moment knowing twently mile house staff was working behind the scenes to make our day perfect.<//Review>< response>

I was at 20 mile house for a wedding. It was really beautiful and well laid out. The wedding took place in a clearing of redwood trees next to a stream. Dinner and dancing followed in the main house and a couple of a joining covered tents. It was cold for April and I wish there were some heat lamps. The stove inside the house kept the house nice and warm though. The food was great, and the gardens were beautiful.</review>

Twenty Mile House deserves a five star rating because they are truly THE BEST EVER. Planning our wedding was so easy breezy that I sometimes thought to myself... "Am I forgetting something?" But nothing was forgotten, they just truly make it that simple. We live in San Diego, but made a weekend trip the year prior to meet their preferred vendors, taste food, and talk details at their wedding fair. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and dessert, and could tell we would be in good hands no matter which vendors we chose. Throughout the planning year, the wedding coordinator Rachel was always available and easy to communicate with via email. She kept us on track with ample checklists and timelines in our shared Dropbox. We had planning meetings via phone. These were very helpful and every detail was discussed. The whole weekend, from check in to check out, was truly seamless! The beauty of the property and surrounding Plumas County Forest area is truly unmatched! I can't say enough amazing things about this venue. Our wedding was truly the most beautiful, perfect day we could ever imagine. We are beyond pleased by our experience at Twenty Mile House!< /review>

Rachel and the ENTIRE team at Twenty Mile House were incredible. The following is an attempt to credibly document the ways in which they made our wedding day the best day ever.
My (now) wife, and I are both the ‘outdoors’ type, and as such, we wanted to find a place where we could surround our guests with the colors, sounds, and feelings that made the two of us so happy. We live in Chicago, and my wife had anxiety about planning a wedding, let alone a wedding 3,000 miles away. Rachel and her team made this an absolute breeze from the jump. Whether it was the barrage of initial questions, or the finer late-stage details, Rachel was always on our side and ultimately had our best interests in mind. The bi-annual wedding fair was an incredible opportunity to see and sample what could and would eventually turn into the details our guests would rave about later. The experience of getting married was heavy enough, but the weight of each decision was made lighter by the guidance and experience of a team and venue that understands the gravity of the situation, and how to maximize such gorgeous surroundings in a way that seems effortless (it isn’t, they’re just that good).
We cannot stress enough, the general importance of having a team of vendors so in tune with the unanimous goal of a wonderful wedding day, as what we found at Twenty Mile House. Every item was executed at the highest level, regardless of any options we chose to include or leave off. Not that it was our first consideration, but the value for this stellar experience cannot be understated. Beth and I were able to be a part of the festivities, rather than a part of the machine of the festivities. That made a world of difference.
We chose Southern Accent for catering (though all options during the fair were delicious). We also had Cakes by Dee for dessert. We are still receiving complements on the food we chose!
Pro Tips:
•	Trust Rachel
•	Trust Todd (DJ)
•	Consider a float trip on the property as a part of the festivities!
•	Consider having friends on site rather than older family members that might usually leave earlier
•	Encourage your guests to explore the area. This part of the Sierras is so beautiful.
At the end of the day, it comes down to two things…an incredibly beautiful place, and a team that makes it their mission to make sure you never forget it.</Text>

<Text>My fiancé found Twenty Mile House (TMH) online while looking for an all-inclusive, forest wedding venue in Northern California. Our first trip to TMH was in late January and there was still plenty of snow covering the grounds. Even then, we knew it was a special place. You could see the potential in every part of the grounds. We met with Rachael and walked all around the property. She was very friendly and welcoming. We quickly decided to book and found a date that worked for us later in the summer. Rachael let us know about the wedding fair which we attended. It was awesome!! Such a cool way to let the couples meet the vendors, taste the food, check out table settings and see the property if full spring bloom! If you book at TMH, go to the wedding fair! I will say that the “add on” option choices that are provided can be a bit overwhelming. You can get lost in the linen and napkin section easily. Rachael was great about working with my fiancé who wanted to create her own packages by combining certain options from a few different sections. These do give the wedding more of a custom feel, if that’s what you’re looking for.
Ok, on to the wedding day!! I’m not sure where to start with my praise. The TMH was everything you’d expect and way more. They were attentive and always asking if we needed anything. Once you gave instructions on how you’d like something, it was almost as if the entire staff knew immediately. The decorations, the flowers, the tables, everything was exactly the way we had imagined it. These guys are good, like REALLY GOOD! We had a plate of appetizers and drinks waiting for us after the ceremony in the trackside cabin. Rachael said she wanted us to have a few minutes alone and just enjoy each other before the craziness of the reception. During the reception, the staff was constantly walking through to check if anyone needed anything. While at the same time clearing empty plates and drink glasses. My wife and I discussed afterwards that we would spend the money over and over again to have our day surrounded by family and friends at such a special place.
We would both like to thank Rachael and the staff at TMH for all their hard work at making our day so amazing! We would highly recommend this venue to any couple looking to book an all-inclusive wedding in the Lake Tahoe area.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

What a magical wedding experience my husband and I had at Twenty Mile House. From the beginning of our experience, all parties were prompt with responses and there to answer any questions we had no matter how big or how small. As a bride, I had very little stress and so much confidence in the staff at TMH, Rachel the wedding coordinator, and associated vendors to make the day happen. I was able to relax and enjoy my wedding day. All the staff and vendors were absolutely amazing. Staying onsite was an incredible experience and allowed us to achieve the intimate feeling we wanted for our wedding. The DJ, Todd, went above and beyond to accommodate our requests. All our guests raved about the food from Southern Accents as well as the gorgeous scenery and friendly staff. I honestly can't list all of the little incredible details that made TMH the perfect place to have our wedding.  We want to relive our wedding day again and again.</Review>

My husband and I got married at Twenty Mile House 2 weeks ago on Thursday, August 9, 2018. To say it was the best day ever would be an understatement! This venue was hands down the best decision we made.

The venue is GORGEOUS (shout out to Jason the groundskeeper!), and has everything you could ever want in an outdoor venue!

We spent the planning process working with Rachel Mann - she is AMAZING! She answered all of our questions, any emails I sent, suggestions, she's just the best! TMH is so well organized, they provided access to all the planning documents on Dropbox which made it so easy.

The vendors are all great! So easy to work with - Here is who we selected:

Catering - Southern Accents - Kent & Adrienne are THE BEST! We used them for the rehearsal dinner, as well as the reception. We opted for the taco bar for the rehearsal and the ice cream sundae bar for dessert - it was fun and a hit!

Floral - Gray's Flowers - Sonia heard my vision and made it happen! We met at the wedding fair, and then communicated via email for the rest. She was so easy to work with and delivered what we envisioned and more!

Bakery - Quincy Cooking Cottage - Connie was perfection! We opted for a selection of desserts & a small cake for cutting/pictures! We added the s'mores bar which was a huge hit. They also catered breakfast the morning of the wedding which was a FABULOUS idea - made it so easy for everyone - one less thing to worry about!

DJ - Todd with Wildsmile Entertainment - This was probably the easiest part of it all! We filled out a music worksheet, honestly only put specific songs for special dances and ceremony mainly (maybe gave him 10-15 songs), and had him do the rest! He was awesome - he played music the crowd danced too and really just worked it!

The TMH Staff - AMAZING! Nova, Rachel, EVERYONE!

I've gotten feedback from many guests that this was THE BEST wedding they have ever been to! Thank you TMH!!!</Text>

I recently had my wedding at the TMH, and it was absolutely, without a doubt, the best decision my husband and I have made. What made the day, weekend, and entire time leading up to the event SO special was that Rachel (and staff) truly made our experience personal and unique, despite the countless weddings they host each year. I have so much to say so have grouped this review in categories below.

Rachel is the most professional, friendly, helpful, and organized wedding coordinator anyone could ask for. She guided us through the planning sheets, helped fill in important details, gave advise where we simply had no ideas, and was very responsive with her communication. She immediately helped us organize all our decorations and “stuff” upon arrival. During the rehearsal and day of, she provided much needed direction on the flow of the ceremony, and managed to keep everyone on track. She also took care of countless small, yet meaningful details that made my husband and I feel extremely well taken care of (for instance, bringing us appetizers/beverages during pictures to make sure we were eating!). She also clearly had a handle on the “vision” for the decorations and theme. She even suggested a few additions that were quite stellar! The wedding (ceremony and reception) went off without a hitch – EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. We had to shuffle the schedule a bit, but the way it was managed by Rachel and staff was so fantastic and low stress. At the end of the night, she gave a heartfelt goodbye to me and my husband, left us food and champagne in our cabin, and told us to simply enjoy our night however long we wanted it to go.

The food was as amazing as Rachel. We went with Pangaea Cafe, led by head chef Holly. She had a delicious array available for us during our trial tasting, and was very flexible with tweaks we asked for (i.e. different topping options available depending on guests’ dietary restrictions), and even accommodated the request for a popcorn machine and toppings bar! Everyone was raving about the food afterward; the stuffed mushroom and homemade salad dressings are of special note!

For dessert, we went with Quincy Cooking Cottage led by Connie. She let us sample (i.e. went out of her way to bake and/or save us pieces) some additional cake flavors and worked with us on personalizing the German Chocolate 8” cutting cake we landed on. We also had a dessert bar, complete with chocolate mousse, mini apple tarts, and a cheesecake bar with toppings. Everything was delicious! More ravings from guests, and we have most of a beautiful, decadent cake remaining to look forward to for a while 

The flowers, provided by Sonia at Gray’s Flower Garden, were STUNNING. She absolutely NAILED the vision I was going for, including the most natural yet beautiful bouquet, appetizer/dessert table with moss, sprigs in napkins, and more. I kept as many arrangements as I could to preserve and keep around the house – so pretty!

Todd with Lionsmile Entertainment was likewise fantastic. He played all the songs we’d requested on the playlist, mixed in some additional songs he knew would be good to get people to the dance floor, and even went out of his way to let us know how much he enjoyed some of the song selections. He was so easy to work with and genuinely loves what he does – he did a great job with the announcements as well, and stayed with us late into the night!

Lastly, some words for the staff and venue itself. The staff were all incredibly helpful, nice, professional, and efficient. I especially remember one of the bar tenders (Jason) making sure the bridal party was taken care of, and left us with some options long after the staff had left. The property is even more beautiful in person than the pictures show, especially with all the personalized touches from our wedding. We had a bit of a windier/cooler day, but the staff turned on heat lamps, started fires, and made sure guests were comfortable.

Overall, a complete rave review for the Twenty Mile House!</text>

My husband and I were married here in one of the first weddings held in this beautiful spot.  I cannot say enough about how perfect our day was:  the ceremony surrounded by wildflowers, The champagne toast that made us all cry, the delicious food (that salmon!), the music that had our grandparents out on the floor as long as our friends were, the impeccable service from the staff, were all just as we had envisioned.  Kevin, the owner, attended to all of our needs from a year before the wedding all the way up until we left the day after.  He even helped us set up pre-wedding yoga and helped my in-laws with our rehersal dinner in neighboring Blairsden, which was really kind.  Every one of our guests said ours was the most beautiful, unique, and fun wedding they had ever been to, and since many were from out of state, that was really saying something.  If you want to get married in a gorgeous, homey, elegant place that no one will forget and have unbeatable service and organization, Twenty Mile House is your perfect pick.  Thank you, Kevin, for making our day unforgettable.< /text>

<Date>1498870989798</Date><text>My husband and I recently got married at the Twenty Mile House.  We could not have been any more impressed with the experience that the venue, staff, and vendors they work closely with, provided us with.  We wouldn't have changed one single detail of our wedding.  All of our guests were very impressed as well.  Nothing went wrong and I really think thats a true testament of their hard work and dedication to making the wedding experience nothing short of perfect.

First off, the wedding coordinator, Rachel Mann, is incredible.  She was on top of every single little detail, always promptly got back to me, answered all my questions and was an integral part of our day.  She took such good care of us and was so thoughtful throughout the day & planning. Simply put, she is amazing.  We can truly never thank her enough for everything she did for us.  She really went above and beyond for us & is really incredible at her job.  We loved her and she was very highly regarded by all who attended & both of our families & bridal party. The rest of the staff was equally as wonderful. So much fun and so thoughtful (including Kelly who is such a doll).  Loved her so much, too!

Secondly, all of the vendors couldn't have done a better job.  I mean that with so much sincerity.  They made everything so easy for me & were so much fun to work with.  I gave them such little guidance and they somehow managed to make our wedding everything I could have ever dreamed of & more if that's even possible.  Connie's desserts at Quincy Cooking Cottage were incredible.  She took my pinterest board and re-created the most beautiful and delicious desserts.  The smore station was such a HUGE hit.

Kent & Adrienne's food (including late night pizza) was loved and complimented by all and they were so sweet to deal with.  It was an absolute pleasure to work with them. Adrienne, herself, came and delivered food to us while we were taking photos (we were starving by them).  She explained everything with so much love and detail.  The food was delicious!  And Sonia from Grays Flower Garden.  My goodness did she deliver!  I sent her one email w/ a few pinterest pics and she managed to give me the most beautiful wedding.  She is incredibly talented and I'm so grateful she was there to take creative control.  Todd, the DJ, kept us dancing all night long and got us all the spanish music we asked for.  We couldn't possibly have had more fun.  That, I can guarantee.

Overall, the venue is spectacular. So beautiful and well maintained. Everyone from the owners (Kevin & Karen), to all of the staff, to all of the vendors they work with, are so amazing at what they do and they truly go out of their way to make sure you have everything you could want and more at your wedding. They take all of the pressure off of wedding planning and make it so easy & flexible for couples and their families.  Their wedding fairs are so much fun and really help w/ planning, as well.  I truly don't think that I could ever thank the Twenty Mile House enough or their staff for going above and beyond for us and making our day so special for us.<//text><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

< Review>
*This review is based on 3 things; Our experience the day of the wedding, the poor communication of the TMH (Twenty Mile House), and the issues we had with the owner the day of.*

The day of our wedding was filled with stress, which we feel could’ve been avoided had TMH been upfront and communicated with us better. It was about 2 weeks before the big day when the Wedding Planner told me she'd be there on our wedding to help make sure things would run smoothly; in addition her name was on the timeline as being there. Unfortunately, not until 3 hours before the wedding did we find out that she wasn't going to be there. One of the many issues with this is that she was the one who knew all of the important info & it seemed no one else was aware of what her & I had discussed. The other issues are that no one told us about her being gone when we arrived, my brother had to go ask where she was and then we found out. This left us having to explain many details during the time we were supposed to be getting ready. We appreciated that the wedding planner helped us with creating a "Wedding Information" and "Wedding Timeline" sheet however, it would have saved us so much stress had it been made clear who would or wouldn't be helping us the day of.

Also I was very disappointed by the poor communication skills that those who represent TMH have. My now husband & I booked this venue about 2mos after getting engaged, in the beginning we didn't have any issues communicating or working with  TMH or its owner and things were going well. However, that changed about 1 month before the wedding and even after the wedding when it came to our deposit (more about that below.) There were many unreturned emails and phone calls; in addition it seems to me that there is a major breakdown of communication between the owner and the wedding planner.

The day of our wedding it seemed the owner had a poor attitude, not just towards us but to some of the guests as well. He mostly seemed unwelcoming and did not come across as professional or friendly. One thing that strongly bothered me was how he acted to a few of our guests. We had a some of them comment that he seemed standoffish, since the wedding I have talked to others who said the same thing.

Another issue was regarding our deposit. To start off it took 46 days to get it back, in that time my husband and I contacted them several times inquiring of its whereabouts. On 7/14/15 I was told by the Wedding Planner that the owner was on vacation. After not hearing anything for 2 weeks, I tried to contact TMH again on 7/28/15 and asked again about the deposit. My husband ended up sending an email directly to the owner on 7/31/15 and heard nothing, flash forward about 1 week into Aug and my husband tries to call them first leaving a message, but with no return call tries again a couple of days later. This time he reaches the Wedding Planner who tells him that the owner just stepped out, but that he'll call us back soom. A few more days go by and we hear nothing so I try again and finally get a hold of the owner who tells me "he thought the deposit was sent out weeks ago.” The contract states that TMH will return the $2000 wedding deposit within a month, and we were told it wouldn't even take that long but rather it should only take 2 weeks at most but that was far from true.

Next there was the fact that our Wedding Information sheet typed up by TMH stated that I would get ready in the "Main House" and my husband would get ready in the "CreekSide Cabin" Not only was it written but we were variably told it many times by the Wedding Planner. When it was time to get ready the owner said that we both where to get ready in the Main House.

Pros:
Beautiful venue.
Table setup/cleanup staff and Jonathan (not sure of his official title) were friendly.
Cons:
Extremely poor communication.
The owner seemed standoffish and unfriendly the day of the wedding.
Deposit was returned late.
Overall TMH left us feeling disappointed in many aspects.<//Review>

{'time': 1442345610116, 'text': 'Mary,\n\nWe are very sorry to hear that your experience at the Twenty Mile House was anything but the highest quality of service we aim for with all of our wedding couples and their guests. We understand that your wedding day is one of the most important and exciting days of your life.\n\nIt seems like there were some regrettable misunderstandings around your wedding. Unfortunately we were unaware of any concerns at the time. We would have worked hard to resolve these if given the opportunity as our biggest goals is to provide a fun, stress free experience for our wedding couples\n\nHopefully we can address some of your key concerns mentioned in your review below:\n\n•\tWedding Planner\n\nI am sorry to hear you were under the impression that Ashley our wedding coordinator was going to be at your wedding. I can imagine that was very stressful for you.\n\nWhen booking your wedding you chose to go with the DIY wedding package that does not include a wedding coordinator, as outlined in your wedding contract. We also communicated with you prior to your wedding suggesting you upgrade to include our wedding coordinator.  You clarified with us you felt like you would be fine without including our wedding coordinator.\n\nWe did provide the assistance of Ashley our wedding coordinator to you leading up to your wedding as a favor, free of charge to ensure you were well set for your DIY wedding day. If at anytime you had communicated you would like to upgrade from the DIY package to include wedding coordination Ashley would have been present on your wedding day. She is very reliable and does a wonderful job as coordinator.\n\nAs a result of your experience and feedback we have removed the DIY option from our package as we do find our weddings run the most smoothly when the wedding couples have professional wedding coordination rather than choose to do a DIY wedding.\n\n•\tWedding preparation location\n\nI am very sorry to hear of the stress getting ready in the house caused you on your wedding day. I can understand the concerns you had about not wanting to see each other and having to take the steps to avoid that.\n\nIf at any point during the preparation process you had communicated to us the concern or stress it was causing you we would have happily moved you to a different location.\n\n•\tAttitude\n\nI am very sorry to hear that you found Kevin to be rude and unfriendly. Kevin is usually a very approachable, friendly person, as he knows how important this is to creating a positive experience. We are sorry you felt otherwise on your wedding day and he will take that feedback onboard. We are glad you found our other staff to be helpful and friendly.\n\n•\tDeposit\n\nI understand your frustration with the late deposit return. I want you to know that this was not intentional in anyway. We have reviewed our deposit return system to ensure this does not happen in the future.\n\n•\tWedding Planning Sheets\n\nI am sorry to hear about the wedding timeline and planning sheet and the confusion and stress this caused you on your wedding day.\n\nAshley our wedding planner made these documents available to you on Dropbox leading up to your wedding day to set you up successfully for your DIY wedding. We will review our system to ensure that it is communicated clearly to our wedding couples that these documents are always available to them at anytime.\n\nOur goal is always to resolve any misunderstandings or concerns with our wedding couples at the time they occur. We are sorry we were not give the opportunity to do this for you at the time. Our biggest goal at the Twenty Mile House is to do whatever we can to make your wedding day as fun and stress-free as possible.\n\nWe are happy to hear that you still had a wonderful wedding day at the Twenty Mile House.\n\nWe wish you both much happiness in the future.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nKaren Steele & Kevin Gage\nOwners\nTwenty Mile House'}<//Resp>

Absolutely worst customer service, emailed John and called him as well but no reply yet. I placed my order twice and both the times i provided both picture ID and pictures of my card and they still cancelled my order and when i sent them an email that why i got cancelled? They didn't reply and not responding to my calls, i placed my order from other businesses (5 star hookah) (Hookah Junkie) (Hookah-shisha) (starbuzz) and had absolutely no problems at all with the payment method and received my items in no time.

I won't recommend ordering from HOOKAH JOHN as their customer service is not up to the mark and you won't get your stuff on time.<//Text>

I have placed many orders throughout the years and have had zero issues. He ships same day (if you order before 2pm PST) and everything comes quickly. Good prices and quality products without any issues, I really cannot ask for more.</review>

This was my first hookah purchase anywhere. I am very satisfied with every step of my purchase. I ordered a DSH Heavy, one their Trimony bowls, a Czech Mate Trumpet base, and a bunch of Tangier’s. They responded to emails quickly. When I received my order with free shipping in 4 days I was very happy to find everything was extremely well packaged. Everything had at least one layer of bubble wrap and nothing was able to bounce around in the box. I am very pleased with all the items I received. Especially the base which is very heavy and sturdy. I will be shopping with Hookah John for a long time to come.<//text>

<review>I have been a long time customer of H.J.  Spent many $$ in purchases.
I'm from Canada.  I have made two orders which were paid for.  H.J.
cancelled both times with no explanation.  I made several attempts to
communicate H.J. but does not respond.  H.J. had good customer
service.  But now his service is rude and non existent.  The Stud
Muffin should go into acting.<//review>< Pictures>

danger! fraud! danger!
They stole $ 938 from me
they canceled my order! They asked me for a picture of my visa and certificate, then canceled the reservation and did not return the money. Dear friends please read reviews before ordering I am really sorry I did not read reviews on John before ordering from his store. Beware of crooks<//review>

Goes to great lengths to stop fraud as would anyone who's operating a business so dont be dissuaded. One thing I'd like to point out and which I had an issue too is his bowls are not in unison or identical but one thing everyone has to consider is they dont make bowls from a mould and they are made by hand so they should be different. Lastly everyone I must point out is he beats the competition free shipping and 10 to 20 percent off doesnt get better</text>< pictures>

First time my card got declined. I replaced my order and it was also cancelled without attempted charge. They dont want your business. Also THEY ASK FOR PICTURE OF YOUR CREDIT CARD over INSECURE EMAIL. God knows what they do with this I highly doubt its up to PCI Standards. If You sent your credit card in I would suggest you report it to your bank because its only a matter of time before someone accesses their email system.< /text>

I'm very lucky to have this place locally(I've seen their YouTube videos prior being a customer, but I didnt think it was here LOL) literally few minutes from home! Great informative caring people.

<review>Worst vendor ever! Cancelled order when clearly payment was available. Request ID and card when payment cleared. Made large purchases which I regret. Do not support this horribly ran business. You cannot get a hold of anyone. Phone goes to voicemail and no one picks up. Business hours are only available when normal people go to work and they close before normal people get off work. Multiple email attempts to resolve them sending used MIG Tradi hookah to me. I overpaid for a hookah that is used, scratched, tarnished, and stained. Emailed them almost everyday ask to speak to manager and owner Anthony said he’s the manger and the complaint will not go to anyone but him. Instead of any resolution he told me I can return the hookah but would take the hit on the shipping cost and 10% restocking fee. Bunch of crooks. How do you send a used product to someone $500 hookah at that and charge shipping and restocking fee to the person you send it to? Bad business. I hope the owner is aware of this situation and if he encourages this business method. The hookah community needs to take their business elsewhere. I should have gotten my hookah straight from Germany instead and cut the middle man.<//review>< Rating>

John is honestly the best hookah vendor in the entire US market. This guy knows his stuff, is passionate about what he does, is constantly giving back value to the community and always striving to come up with new ways to advance the art of hookah. I've been a long time customer of his and I will always remember how awesome it was to find out Hookahjohn was only 12 minutes away from where I lived. I feel lucky being able to get all the best hookah stuff I need, the SAME day.

John is friendly, super helpful and very generous. Thanks John, you're the man.<//review>

I have been a customer of Hookah John since November 2012 and I have never had a bad experience with my purchases or customer service. Even though I am from Toronto, Canada, and they are located in California, the team is very prompt and professional with their communication.

In almost 4 years there has been one or two odd occurrences where they were out of certain brands/flavours, but they are very accommodating with providing alternatives.

Very happy and lifetime customer!< /Text>

Poor experience. Owner wants me to send a digital scan of my ID (front & back) over email which offers ZERO security. Simply unwillingly to compromise.
Guess you've been burned a few times and see everyone as a scammer. How do I know you won't sell my ID? You come off as the type of person with the lack of professionalism in your emails.

Edit: It's taken 8 months for a reply yet you haven't addressed anything said...your attitude speaks for itself.< /text>

FRAUD!!! STAY AWAY!!!

They ask for personal information, and cancel orders. Customer Service is non existent. I called and it sounded like some guy woke up from a nap. He was mumbling the whole time.

They ask you to provide copy of ID and Credit Card, with all of information revealed. In this day and age, this is enough information for identity theft. Their website does not seem to have security in place, and I am doubtful they have some kind of email encryption either.

Your info is not safe here! Shop elsewhere!<//text>

<resp>{'time': 1468608851077, 'text': "please, your credit card was declined, that's all."}< /resp><Review>Well, if I could give a negative star I would. First off, this is the second time I have tried to order from hookah john. The first time, the same thing that is happening now, happened. Let me explain, I order about 90 bucks worth of hookah, and fill out the information for shipping, and send them a picture of my photo id, blah blah blah right? So after it is placed and ready to mail, I check my bank to see if the money has come out yet, no, it hasn't and I have two pending transactions in my bank account. Second time, I decide maybe I'll give them a second chance because they have a great price for everything. So I try again same thing send in the info and the credit card info and boom, two more pending transaction, so I email them thinking maybe I pushed the button twice to order, but no, they tell me my card was declined because I cancelled the order, and I did not. If you try to contact them about the money issues they will cancel your order, but the transactions will still be in your bank! DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE GUYS, they are a scam and I have never been able to make a purchase through them, they will get your information and abuse it.</Review>< pics>

I placed an order of about $400. Card was declined because my bank thought it was fraud. I told the bank it was fine and placed the order again. Someone from customer service at HookahJohn emailed and asked for my license (I'm assuming to check that I'm 18 or older) and the last four digits of the card I used. My license doesn't match the address on my card (which is pretty normal), and they told me this. I explained that I had just moved but everything was correct, and instead of letting me know what the issue was or requesting further information, they just didn't respond, and I waited nearly two weeks before realizing the order was cancelled. This is HORRIBLE service for a site that sells overpriced hookahs, and I don't appreciate being treated like they couldn't care less about me or my business. If customer service or prices are important to you, don't shop here.< /review>

Worst customer service! Called a few times to ask some questions regarding the shipping, and  a person in charge of "customer service" was very rude and disrespectful. He answered " you have called about 5 times. What do you need?" in a mumbling voice as if he has just woken up. First of all, how does he know i had called 5 times? Was he looking at the phone screen the whole time and didnt want to pick up the phone? I was about to place an order for over $1000 between hookahs and shisha but not any more. There are plenty of other vendors out there.<//text>

<text>Love Kenny, but I don't know if they use cheap material because my nails keep falling off. So I went somewhere else and 7 out of my 10 nails were green underneath. Honestly wish they would used better stuff.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I'm always happy with my nails. Suggestions: come Monday through Thursday. If you come on the weekend Friday, Saturday or Sunday be prepared to wait. Well worth it in my opinion.<//text>

The place seemed great at the time... But a week later my moms feet began to swell and feel tingily and  got a bad Viral infection called cellulitis from their dirty equipment. At first she didn't think anything of it but then she got hospitalized for 3 days. she is still on Antibiotics Her doctor asked when her last pedicure was done he said that's how she got the infection in her leg. **** consumer beware*****< /review>

I give this establishment 1 star only because the receptionist is a sweetheart and very welcoming. If i wasn't for her and the hospitality she shown me today if it was possible i'd give this place no stars...the rest of the ladies were rude and somewhat racist. My nails looked like a 2yro did them i am very dissatisfied with the way my nails look and im upset about how i was treated, I'll never go there again.</text>

<Review>Great experience renting bikes from here!  There is parking garage next door, which makes it hassle-free.  The flat-rate $15 for all-day on a single-speed beach cruiser type was fair and bikes were in good condition.  You will need to pay in cash, so be sure to plan for that or use an ATM nearby.  The workers were efficient and friendly.  It is very easy to get down to the bike path along the beach and pier area.  The path connects all the way to Venice and beyond.</Review>< Pics>

Awesome spot for renting bikes for the day - best value around at $15 bike/day. Rented 3 cruisers and a tandem bike - all were basically brand new and rode very well. The owner was super friendly and helpful, gave us a map and helped with directions. The bike rental also included helmets and locks, which I really appreciated. Great spot to start from biking, quick ride to biking trails and lots of food around. Cash only establishment - but pay when you return the bikes, so easy to grab what you need. Highly recommended.</review>

<user_name>Arash Dounel<//user_name><review>This place has incredible service and understanding for their customers. I showed up with my two kids and they were able to quickly set up a quality bicycle with a trailer. The mechanic on site was pleasant and very quick to do his job. The owner herself sprayed down and disinfected all of the surfaces of the bike and the trailer for me and my children. We had an amazing time and felt that the location of the business in proximity to the beach was perfect. Great prices as well and I will definitely be revisiting!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4cb0e865435:0x50aedc0e750b58a1</Gmap_id>< pics>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Quick and easy bike rentals here. Bikes are $15 a piece all day until 4pm.  This is a cash only establishment, although they do have an ATM inside the bike shop. The owner and associate are pleasant, fast and super efficient with the transactions.

Inside the shop there are rows and rows of bikes from cruisers and single speed bikes with either hand or foot brakes.  Bikes are in good working order, clean and maintained. Removable baskets and locks are provided for the amenities.

They are located right next to a bar / gastropub so you're able to grab some food and drink beforehand. Parking is not the best as there is only structure parking with super low ceiling and small spaces or street parking. ( Good luck with that one).

If you're in the area and looking to rent their place is fairly cheap for an all day rental. I'd come back again.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUJxY1KNeFktL3cb_MEE-GRziMwQfwfX4j6L8Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI3ujvEypEpRHQl6jaPdh8DVRw4nm_zYvTvetM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObzq0nEgFXqI4JAfRH9k35CFBE8ctxwb2UmMvV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4cb0e865435:0x50aedc0e750b58a1< /Gmap_id></record>

An organization I belong to decided to hold its regional meeting here, so I drove all the way from Tahoe to be at the meeting on time by 1:30 pm. Had I known how fabulous this store would be, I would have arrived an hour earlier and shopped my guts out ! (Especially since they offered a 20% discount to any attendees).<//Text>

Had such a good experience the first time that I went back the next day to rent another one! Huge thanks to Arnold, the shop owner, for his friendliness, provision of lock & basket, and his guidance with the bike routes! He even provided a map of the routes.

Located about 3 street back from the beach, it’s super easy to collect your bike here and ride down the beach bike path. We opted for the single speed cruiser bikes and they were great. Cost us $15 each bike for all day. Bikes come with bike locks so you can walk along the shops at Venice beach or out on the piers. Helmets available too.
Super friendly and helpful staff.
Parking next door at 5 cost us $12 for about 5 hours.<//text>< pictures>

I had a very good experience with this rental establishment.  They were very friendly and accomodating.  We rented a few bikes along with a trailer as well as a kid tag along.  The seat rotated with the tag along, so I tried tightening it, and while it got better, the issue was still not resolved.  This should of have  been checked and corrected at time of rental.  Due to the inconvenience I was offered a sincere apology for the troubles as well as a minuscule discount.  Note that this is a cash only establishment.  Overall I was happy with the rental and would not hesitate to rent here again.</text>

This is a cash only business, so bring cash or use their ATM. They also required collateral in the form of a driver’s license (I’m not sure what else they would accept). Would rent from here again.

<Rating>5</Rating><review>It is cash only but the great prices and service make it absolutely worth it. Took the time to make sure bikes were adjusted and helmets fit. We took a bit longer than 2 hours but they still gave us the reduced rate. Very fair. Bikes are well maintained- we took the path up to Venice and back with no issues. A small business that is absolutely worth supporting!</review>< pics>

Really friendly guys. Bikes are well used but kept up. He took a brand new one right out of the window for my eight year old. He set each of them up for us and made sure the air was ok in the tires. He supplied 2 locks and we were on our way! Had an awesome time in Venice. Reasonable prices, great store.<//Text>

This is the perfect place to rent a nice bike around town and along the beach. The owner was really nice and helpful. He had the best little baby seat for my baby along with a nice bag older for my huge diaper bag that clipped perfectly on my bike. He gave us a map of how to get from his shop to the ocean. I recommend this place to anyone who’s looking for a fun and nice place to rent bikes from.<//Review>

<text>Great prices, probably the best in Santa Monica, but the bikes are quite run down. They didn't seem tuned up either. My gal's tires were flat and my seat was in a cockeyed position.

Our brakes also felt a little loose and unsafe, so we walked down hills.

That being said, it was a fun ride and nice to start off a little away from the beach.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Great service. Called into 3 other bike rentals before finding this one. Great friendly service and the cheapest rental, $15 a day. The ones by the pier have bad service and rusty old bikes at double or triple the price. Had a great time cycling along the beach path.< /Text>

Excellent experience renting bikes on the 4th of July. Simple process, $15 per bike for the whole day. Bikes were in good condition and we enjoyed riding them around the boardwalk. Would highly recommend and definitely would rent again from here if we decided to go out again!< /text>

Our bikes were great, they were a bit older, but all 8 of them ran well, brakes worked and tires were pumped up.  Plus he was just getting some newer ones when we left.  Good service, no  hassles.  We rode to Venice and back and everything worked well.<//text>

Pros: solid and well-maintained bikes, professionalism, and price

Cons: none  (I thought the location was too far at first....how wrong I was)

All in all,  thank u Ron for contributing to our memorable and pleasurable time in Santa Monica. Rental place might not be right next to the ocean, but it's conveniently situated few block away of the beach; the ride to the beach took us no more than 4-5min; moreover, how beautiful that ride was.....a well marked road for bikes lead you straight to the beach. Ron also assisted us in free parking, right next to his store.  Thank u, my wife and I enjoyed it very  much</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
This is an example of what happens when a place gets too busy. I went straight here because it had a great rating of 4.8. Unfriendly, bordeline-irritated staff, didn't explain anything, basically put a bike on the sidewalk and walked back in. Had to queue to ask for the seat height to be changed, then queue again to request brakes. It felt like the guy was getting annoyed with me just asking any questions. 3 stars because the bikes were fine, but service poor.<//Review>

<text>Quality bikes in the middle of Santa Monica (not on the beach).  I didn't do much research when I made my reservations, and allowed the name to let me assume that this business was close to the beach.  It is not.  It is on 4th between Broadway and Santa Monica Blvd.  That said, the bikes were of high quality, the staff was very friendly and helpful.  It is a cash only business, but we were informed of this in advance, so that wasn't a problem.  They outfitted us with 2 bikes and a bike trailer for our toddler (and a helmet).  It is not a bad ride to the beach, but it is on busy, major thoroughfares with bike lanes.  It is quite a hill down to the beach (and back up) so the single speed bikes might need to be walked (we got multi-speed bikes for the higher $ rate).< /text><Time>1437944957170</Time></record></dataset><record>
<review>I needed a decent bike for a day and it was fine. I called around town and the other shop that I found that had road bikes was about twice as expensive (though there bikes were much higher quality)

The road bikes are adequate and their prices are reasonable.  They were quite good about swapping out my pedals.  I could have use a larger bike and they could have been more precise about how much more it would cost if I kept the bike till the next day, but all is fine.  And they were kind enough to let me use their restroom to freshen up after my ride.

One thing---I hate leaving my ID to secure a bike.  It makes me nervous to not have my drivers license when I am traveling. If they had lost it or had a burglary I might not have been able to board the plane.< /review>< userid>

Everything was fine until I returned the bike where I was advised that I had to pay cash. This wouldn't have been an issue if I was advised this at the start, but they don't have a sign nor do they advise this verbally. This so people withdraw the money from their ATM on which they charge a $3.50. This is what is known as a scam and ruins the whole experience.</Review>

Easy rental procedure. Beach Cruiser at an all day rate, map & lock included. Tip: Pick up early & drop off late. Shop for snacks & drinks along the way before biking the trail from Santa Monica to Venice Beach.<//Text>

The service here was horrible! They threw us on bikes with low tires and shorted us a bike lock. They never told us drop off time or cash only policy and treated us awful upon returning the bikes. I should've paid the extra to rent from the beach!<//Text>

Great experience, $10 flat fee for rental after 4 pm was not bad , considering the great sceneries you are about to enjoy in the beach. Great business as other people mentioned in their reviews<//Review>

Rented a tandem bike last week and got a flat tire while a mile up the beach, they were very quick to respond to our call and picked us up, only charging us for the time we spent riding the bike before we called. Would rent again.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It was a very kind and concise system, so even I, a Japanese person, was very helpful! Also, I was worried if there was a bicycle with a brake, but since I was able to choose it, I think that it will satisfy everyone from those who want to use a light cross bike to those who want to use a bicycle with a basket that emphasizes convenience. When renting, you have to leave a card with a face, but since I only needed a student ID card, I think that any card with a face is fine. The only downside was cash only, which I noticed when I returned it and only paid $ 10 (I got $ 5 off).

(Original)
とても親切で簡潔なシステムだったので日本人の私でもとても助かりました！また、ブレーキ付きの自転車が有るか心配でしたが、選択できるようになっていたので軽いクロスバイクを使いたい人から籠付きの利便性重視の自転車を使いたい人まで満足させられると思います。レンタルの際は顔付きのカードを預けなければなりませんが、自分は学生証で済んだので、多分顔さえ入ったカードであれば何でも大丈夫だと思います。ただ一つ難点なのがキャッシュオンリーで、自分は返却時に気付き、10ドルしか払えませんでした(5ドルまけてもらった)<//Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) We rented two bicycles for the day, when we arrived there were many people lining up, despite this we did not wait long before taking into account our bikes.
The store is open late at night, which allows you to enjoy!
Plus the prices are really affordable.
Each bike comes with a large basket and padlock.
The frames are in good condition!

Nous avons loué deux vélos pour la journée, à notre arrivée il y avait beaucoup de monde qui faisait la queue, malgré cela nous n'avons pas patienté longtemps avant de prendre en compte nos vélos.
Le magasin est ouvert tard le soir, ce qui permets de bien profiter !
De plus les prix sont vraiment abordables.
Chaque vélo est fourni avec un grand panier et un cadenas.
Les montures sont en bon état !<//text>

(Translated by Google) The shop staff are friendly. You can borrow it all day and it's as cheap as $ 15, but it's a bit messy. I left my passport because it is a rule to leave my ID during rental. I was a little worried, but the shop staff are very good people.

(Original)
お店の人はフレンドリーです。1日中借りれて$15と安いですがちょっとボロいです。レンタル中はIDを預ける決まりなのでパスポートを預けました。ちょっぴり不安でしたが、お店の人はとても良い人です。< /review>

(Translated by Google) His bikes are very junk.
I only have the size 2 to run with the whole course going for it.
In your whole country, it is not good to come to Iran.
You have to have real life here, not at the height of the possibilities to go wrong. Everyone lives in prosperity but their people just whine like yes yes Jimble. One year to live in this hell you will grow old in your youth. Once zoomed in on your rotation you don't lay eggs with your girlfriend.
Once you were whipped for a drink you knew what freedom was. Once you get married to your daughter you know what force means.
Once you get jailed for your long hair on the prison and open the courtroom, then you know why Jooney Mao's are about to die.
When you see a mullah every two steps you realize you are just kidding.
This shit that we say is a scam on the left.
You are giving life to us.
Happen again, patriots, not us, follow us through the mouse hole to escape this mystery.
Holiday in France, Spain, Spain, Dubai, London, or other states, we plan for a two-month Ramsar what to do.
Have you ever heard of stitching money in your country? Have you ever been killed for bread? Have you ever been killed by your sister or family for photos of an unlucky couple?
Do you understand what poverty means at all?
Do you understand what cultural poverty is written about?
Has anyone died before, but it is not my fault, and you feel so helpless to jump on your side while you ask for help?
Have you ever been accused of laughing?
Have you ever gone to the Friday prayers and realized that people still love you, lying and lying back, and you see and be greedy, but you can't say anything and you are frustrated with your family's fears because you are breaking into a public confession? Gheil and after a week of public execution.
Have you ever seen the color of misery at all?
Ever seen the green and white Honda engine? Have you ever slept in a nightclub for stupid reasons? Have I ever been able to get in your face or your foot?
Do you know what a shock pain is?
Do you know what ethanol is with soda?
But thankfully you know what fun is.
You know it's easy to walk a woman hours later.
You know there is nothing wrong with at least one's fault.
You know what life means.
Our recreations of daily life and boredom with you. You're in paradise.
By the time I was living there, I had been a two-month-old dip since I was playing town.
Because he has never seen a poor Iranian freedom community so far he wants to empty his prison life. What else do you want from your country?

Know how much your life is ...

دوچرخه هاش خیلی آشغاله.
من یدونه سایز۲۴دارم با کورسی کل میندازم میره واسه خودش.
در کل کشورتون خوب نیس بیاید ایران.
زندگی واقعی رو باید اینجا داشته باشید نه تو اوج امکانات دنبال چرتو پرتو خلاف رفتن. زندگی تو رفاهو همه بلدن ولی مردمشون فقط چس ناله میکنن که اله بله جیمبله. یه سال بیاید تو این جهنم زندگی کنید پیر میشید تو جوونیتون. یه بار ارشاد روتون زوم کنه تخم نمیکنید با دوس دخترتون برید بیرون.
یه بار واسه مشروب خورن شلاقتون بزنن میفهمید آزادی ینی چی. یه بار که با دختر بگیرتن عقدت کنن میفهمی زور یعنی چی.
یه بار که به جرم موی بلند بردنت زندان و باز داشگاه،تازه بعدشم واست حکم بریدن میفهمی چرا جوونای ماآرزوی مرگ دارن.
وقتی که تو هر ۱۰قدم یه آخوند ببینی میفهمی تازه لاشخورا کین.
این لاتایی که میگن ما لاشخوریم چپ اینا هم نمیشن.
زندگی رو شما ها میکنید ما داریم بهش میدیم.
سرو تهتونو بزنن بازم شادید و وطن پرست نه مث ما ها دنبال سوراخ موش واسه فرار از این سگدونی.
تعطیلات میری فرانسه اسپانیا دبی لندن یا ایالت های دیگه،ما واسه یه رامسر دوماه نقشه میکشیم که چیکار کنیم.
تاحالا شنیدی تو کشورتون سر پول بخیه بکشن؟ تا حالا شده واسه نون آدم بکشن؟ تا حالا شده واسه عکسای یه نمور باز از خواهر یا فامیلاتون آدم بکشن؟
تو میفهمی اصلا فقر مغزی یعنی چی؟
میفهمی فقر فرهنگی با چه (خ) نوشته میشه؟
تاحالا شده جلوت آدم بمیره ولی تخمتم نباشه و خیلی بی احساس از بغلش رد شی در حالی که کمک میخواد؟
شده تا حالا به جرم خندیدن بگیرنت؟
شده تاحالا بری هیئت و نماز جمعه و بفهمی که مردمت هنوز خرن و دروغ و عقب موندگی رو دوست دارن و تو ببینی و حرص بخوری اما نتونی چیزی بگی و از ترس جون خونوادت لال شی چون که تو یه بشکن به جرم تشویش اذعان عمومی قپونی ببرنت قزل و بعد از یه هفته اعدام در مله عام.
شماها تا حالا رنگ بدبختی رو دیدید اصلا؟
تاحالا موتور هوندا های سبزو سفیدو دیدید؟ تا حالا شده به دلایل احمقانه شبو تو بازداشتگاه بخوابی؟ تا حالا باتونم خوده تو صورتت یا پات؟
میدونی درد شوکر چیه؟
میدونی اتانول با نوشابه چیه؟
اما خوشبختانه میدونی تفریح چیه.
میدونی راحت قدم زدن یه زن ساعتای بعد ۱۲ یهنی چی.
میدونی چیزی سر جاش نباشه حداقل تقصیر یکی هس و قبول میکنه.
میدونی که زندگی یعنی چی.
تفریحات ما زندگی روزمره و حوصله سر بر شماهاس.تو بهشتید بدبختا خبر ندارید.
به مولا من اونجا زندگی میکردم دو ماهه دیپ بودم از بس که شهرستانی بازی در میاوردم.
چون به ایرانی جماعت آزادی بدی بیچاره تا حالا ندیده میخواد یه عمر اسارتشو یهو خالی کنه تر میزنه.ناموس دیگه چی میخواید از کشورتون؟

قدر زندگیتونو بدونید درکل...</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Unfortunately a bad experience: we asked for 2 MTBs, they gave us two old ones in bad condition (the handlebars bent when riding, the gears didn't fit properly, the chain was rusted and neglected), they didn't check if the tires were properly inflated (they weren't) They reluctantly adjusted the seat, they did not give a map only reluctantly insisting, nor did they give a helmet. The system charges you a whole day if you pedal more than 2 hours, for 4 hours we pay $ 30 dollars each.

(Original)
Lamentablemente una mala experiencia: pedimos 2 MTB, nos dieron dos viejas en mal estado (el manubrio se doblaba al andar, los cambios no entraban bien, la cadena estaba oxidada y descuidada), no chequearon si los neumáticos estaban bien inflados (no estaban), a desgano ajustaron el asiento, no dieron mapa solo indicaciones de mala gana al insistir, tampoco casco. El sistema te cobra jornada entera si pedaleas más de 2 horas, por 4 horas pagamos $30 dólares cada una.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The cutest and quaintest, as well as charming general store. The staff here are the most curteous and helping I have come across in a very long time. Keep up the great customer service and your smiles help more than you know< /text>

Very convenient and incredible selection. They are very reasonably priced as well. Not like you might expect. To boot their staff are the nicest and most friendly people you're going to find in the world! Definitely a store that you should visit< /Review>

The service was slow. Attended an event and they had one server working the entire restaurant. This was on a Tuesday night and I felt bad for the girl. To think they wouldn't have another server to assist. Food was forgotten, drinks were sitting beyond time for being served and it was a decent amount of people who attended the event. The venue is beautiful, the food was ok. The pricing and the quality is eh. Considered this place for a date night but it's a hard pass. Oh I also didn't have to pay for my food. I waited for an hour or so.<//text>

<review>Visited LA right before covid hit and stopped here during happy hour. Amazing and cheap drinks and great happy hour food as well. My friend and I had the Niall, which I wish I could’ve taken back with me to my hometown. We were the only people in there so service was no problem. It was also a Monday but with drinks and service like this, I’m sure they’re packed on the weekends.</review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Super cool place. Came here to catch a tennis tournament and the host was super helpful in having a television switched to the Tennis tournament for us.

The crowd is super trendy/young. Beautiful people and celebs. We saw a famous former Chicago Bull. Not MJ :D

The space - Clean but maybe a bit cluttered with furniture. There was a very loungey/cool vibe.

Food - Decent wings. I only had their wings so I cannot speak on their food in general.

Service - Drinks came quick. Food did as well. Service felt reminiscent of a high-end establishment. Def appreciated.

In conclusion - Less of a sports bar and more of a trendy hangout spot.< /Review>< pics>

Loud music was hard to have a conversation. Bloody mary didn't meet my expectations. The venue is very nice but I didn't dig the crowd or the drinks. Food was really good for a bar!<//review>

<Text>Nice place. But the bartender was kinda rude & lazy. I think she was high or drunk...she didnt just ask for a card. She wanted us to pay for our drinks. Lol the bar was empty! After that we weren't going to order more.< /Text>< resp>

<Review>What you did tonight was unacceptable. The nerve of this establishment to ever present above it patrons. Particularly those who you charged over $1000 and dated to claim they wouldn’t pay.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

This store is awesome.... It's clean employees are friendly, kind and admit of items to choose from. The Dinuba north side store is another story. They could use this store as an example of what a store should look like.< /Text>

As his appearance and attitude matches the Dirty unprofessional look of his store. He's rude and never smiles an reminds me of Miles Finch in the movie Elf.. There are a couple friendly female staff members that work hard and try to make our dollar tree shopping experience a pleasant one. Though it appears they are stretched thin. when possible i shop at other Visalia Dollar tree stores.</text><time>1608887002742< /time><user_id>106935869056903985182</user_id></record>

<Text>I would always go and stop by Dollar Tree on the busy roads of Noble and Ben Maddox which is near Save Mart! Opened in excellent location! Well-stocked, and there is everything you need! Plenty of supplies! Everything for a dollar! Very spacious, tidy, and organized! Courteous and helpful employees! Great customer service! 👍< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The whole back of the store smells like urine. The staff was having to spray air freshener down the aisles but it hardly helped. The staff was rude and trashy. They complained about restocking, the kines of people, and about their own employees. There are dozens of carts full of stuff just sitting in a corner of the store. Never again will I go to this dollar tree.<//Review>

I recently had the privilege of being treated by Dr. Newman. She is kind, funny, and provides excellent care! I never felt like she was trying to push me to spend more money, and I trust her assessment of what is most necessary for my care. All the other staff I worked with were pleasant, answered all my questions, and took great care of me! I do not wish to get treatment from any other dentist. The comfort dog is also a fantastic perk!< /text>

I have been a patient at Dr. Fealy’s for 20+ years. I would never go anywhere else. I like that the office has state of the art technology to provide the best images. The staff is friendly and very professional. I have never had any problems with my dental work over the years. I used to have Paula as my hygienist. She was amazing and very thorough. I miss her. I saw Kari/Carrie yesterday and she was amazing! So personable and did a great job cleaning my teeth. All the staff has been so wonderful over the years.I would like to say that there’s never been a time where I’ve walked into that office and Courtney hasn’t had a smile on her face. She is a gem. So thankful for her over the years. I highly recommend Dr. Fealy Dentistry. It just feels like family. God bless you all
Thank you all so much for your tender loving care over the years.

Everyone goes above and beyond their job requirements compared to every other dental office I’ve been to in the last 50 Years!  The staff is exceptional and great to be with! I just couldn’t see going anywhere else.. why would you want to go anywhere else? The girls all can cover each other’s jobs and in some aspects can help Dr. Fealy do his with precision! I’ve been a patient for nearly 10 years and most likely will be for another 30 years!
Dr. Fealy and his staff = The Best!!!< /Text>

It’s always a pleasure and for me sometimes an emergency ( root canal/ crown) to seek treatments from professionals that just know how to fix ur mouth. Yesterday’s appointments were for cleanings but again, fast, efficient,  and can feel all the grooves again. We Love our dentist! 💕😁🤩😬<//review>

<text>To begin with, let me say that Dr. Fealy is an amazing individual. He is courteous, professional and genuinely cares for his patients. And, I feel extremely sad having to put such a low rating.

The ONLY reason for the 1-star rating is the FRONT DESK. They are probably one of the rudest bunch I have ever countered in my life. If Dr. Fealy makes changes in the future, I and my family will be promptly go back to him.</text>< Pics>

The staff and dental professionals are fantastic.  Always alert, friendly and efficient.  The hygienist Anika is the best I have ever experienced.  Friendly and comforting, but most of all extremely good at her profession.  She really cares about your oral health and condition of your teeth.<//Review>

They have a good selection of stuff but the prices are way too high. People go to thrift stores because they cant afford to pay full price for new items but the stuff here is just as expensive. The people at the front seemed to be friendly though.</Review>

Absolutely love this place. Love the staff as well, not sure what the other people on here are talking about.  I go in there everyday and spend $10-$20 and very much worth it. As long as their prices stay consistent,  I will be consistent as well. Management is super sweet as well. I think she deals with a lot and most people in the area don't know how to respect others if she was not letting you have your way. Just overall great place.<//text>

Ridiculous prices. Someone needs to remind them that their items were donated so to price items at retail value when they're clearly used is ridiculous. Never coming back.<//text>

<review>Delusional pricing. I am talking absolutely bonkers. I have seen items in here go unsold for literal years. They think every item they have belongs on antique roadshow. They have a used church rug priced at literally $2000. DVD players priced at $50, Calculators at $40, Destroyed furniture at hundreds. Don't forget that the inside of the store is disgusting. No wonder why they are losing their building. You are better off ordering things full price from eBay.< /review>< Time>

So - is this an antique store or a thrift store? They are making 100% profit on donated items and charging more than what local antique stores do for similar items.</Review>

These people put up w/a lot of theft and associated B.S......I understand their frustration.That does not mean that it's ok to stereotype, profile, and disrespect,  every homeless and "weird" patron that walks in.
I see it every time I go in there to shop. At times I've just walked out because of the way the employees are allowed to treat their customers, and I am not one that can just ignore it.<//Text>

I found some nice items and was walking around with them. A Queen Bee in a short blond bob asked, "Were those on the floor?" (Implying I got them out of the back). I showed her were they were on the shelf and she walked off w/o comment.  Jan 11, 2017 @ 1000. Generally, the people here are so nice. She doesn't need to work there anymore. Holier than thou people, acting superior to and suspicious of thrift shoppers is not very christian-like.<//Review>

<review>So yesterday I went in to get a silk scarf for my dress...couple minutes later I decided to get a new outfit somewhere else so about an hour later I decided to return the scarf since i no longer needed it. My boyfriend went in and asked for a refund the manager said because we no longer wanted it they can't do a refund. But still yet asked my boyfriend if he even had a receipt? Like if it mattered when she had already stated that they can't do a refund...as if she was implying something. Either way it was a dumb reason why not to get a refund. Or she could've at least let me trade my scarf for a different one. Since I no longer needed it that specific scarf to match my dress. I believe it was bad service. I will never shop there again.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x809053f130e5294b:0x97b8c76aaf02d08f< /GmapID>< user_name>

<Review>Wow. NOT A CHRISTIAN  ESTABLISHMENT AT ALL!! Just watched then treat a homeless woman like trash. Is that what Jesus would have done? I think not. The next time you want to act that way, don't do it with witnesses. I will never be back. Shame on all of you!< /Review>< pictures>

Good selection and some nice finds. A little bit pricier than most, but they do their research and have quality stuff.< /Review>

Well placed restaurant with some delicious fish served with tasty and fresh vegetables. Recommended the zucchini noodles with the seasoned tuna. No need for fancy dressings, the bowl will taste good with some soy sauce and little else. Perfect for a quick lunch!<//text>

For its price I really thought it was more like average compared to South Bay. The scoop was smaller than Poke House I believe,  so it was a bit disappointing.

The staff is quite friendly.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsOUZYeNRYxaizLx9HuptgdUDnwx6gCIXYcPZ7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP--X5CtRZvUZPufYFiGCE9AfkCixHOZRgwEDtE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKhRQoM1hCVdwCjdaMTdygsPUrferI34fiKOlQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Everything tastes fresh and is very flavorful! I honestly like this place better than the poke I’ve had in Hawaii. It’s also helpful that they label their gluten free sauces.<//Text>

<Review>Might not be the traditionalists cup of tea but a good selection of poke. Fresh tasty and large portions at a resonance price. Staff is friendly and location is clean and bright. So many options executed in an efficient way. Love it have been back many times since I discovered this place. And I never have been a big poke person. Try it you won’t regret the experience.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

This is the only poke place I go to in Pleasanton. I have tried others, and each time I've wished that I had just gone to this place. Prime Poke has a good option of fish to choose from, and the sauces are really good. I always order the two protein, because the three is too much for me, and I have always gotten the tuna for the free scoop, the marinated salmon, and the marinated tuna (I dont remember the exact name). For the last meat you order, they let you choose mix ins, I get the cucumber, cilantro, and serrano. Then for sauces my favorite for the mix ins in spicy poke and teriyaki. For the sauces on top, I would recommend sriracha and the spicy mayo, if you like spice, or just the spicy mayo if you want it to be mild. However, even with all that spicy stuff on top, it is not an overpowering amount of spice. I tried for the first a topping, I forget the name but I'll include a picture, and it was a good amount of crisp but the pieces were just a little too large for my taste. If you're in Pleasanton, and feel like poke, I would definitely try this place out!< /text>

<review>Good place for a poke bowl. Lots of good variety and good portions. When I went, the rice was a little bit wetter than I'd like. They were also giving out a free scoop of either spicy tuna or crab salad which was delicious.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Great food. Portions are getting smaller and smaller. Pretty sad when you’re paying that price. Just asking for consistency that’s all.<//Text>

Mediocre poke; pricier than competition. Utterly unenthusiastic service - they almost don't want you there!< /text>

This place used to be a real gem, but they've raised their prices, and really control their portion sizes now...it's just ok now. I don't come here nearly as often as I used to.</review>

Went by today walking around looking for a car. Found one I liked, but it didn't have a price just a KBB value on the sticker so we went inside to ask price. Guy told me that's now how it works that they service people with bad credit. I asked how much a specific car was cash, he said.. "See the KBB value then double it" Really? Cash? And they charge you DOUBLE the value of the car. They are absolutely terrible. Stay away. They literally just prey on the weak or people who need help and have no choice. They were going to charge $12K for a car worth HALF the price. STAY AWAY!</Review>

Review long over due. Apologize to Nadine but she helped me out ane was great. I went in Mid November 2020. Prior to that for the previous 7 months I worked on my credit score. Got my score up nearly 200 points. I was approved for $0.00 down. Credit was still considered fair but they still took a chance on me. Thank you so much. As of today made every payment so far and hopefully will have this car paid off in a year or less.</text>

Nadine made my first car buying experience one that will remain with me for a lifetime. She was patient while I test drove 5-6 cars. Considering I'm very picky she stuck it out with me and my friend, to help me get my perfect match. Thanks Nadine and Carhop for my car!!!< /text>

<Review>Miguel Hernandez here at CarHop National City was fantastic.... The customer service was 100% satisfying from the time that I called him until the time we walked out of the office. He was able to get us into a vehicle that my husband and I liked and with reasonable payments. I recommend anyone that has bad credit or no credit to come here for their next purchase. We will be coming back when we are reach to update.
We ended up choosing a 2012 Chevy Malibu.</Review></record>

Instead of leaving with a car today I left carhop frustrated and upset. I came back to this place 3 times. I waited for 4 hrs for nothing. As far as them trying to finance you. Make sure you ask d a lot of questions because they really won’t tell you anything unless you ask. You don’t get to choose choose your  own vehicle they choose it for you base on  your credit and no down payment and top of it the y will bill you bi weekly which I wasn’t told when I first visited this place. So add that together $197 bi weekly that equals to $394 a month. Cars are not worth paying that much because I have never paid a car for that much on a car ever! The advertisement they have posted on the wall is a lie. They don’t work hard to help you with they don’t care they won’t even try to negotiate With you if you disagree then goodbye. They could careless. There are many places out there that can help you and truly work hard and not let you leave without a car and mind you to pay off more than $8000 on the vehicle they chose for me with broken ac is plain BS! Don’t be too desperate to get a vehicle because you will end up having issues with a car and then pay more out of your pocket for service . Be smart! I was very disappointed in this place.< /review>

I have to say there are a few staff here that make it great for me. There are a few that make me so upset I want to just return my car and use the bus system instead. Nadine being the first person she is rude has no customer service at all. I had to come and change my rating. I do t like to be spoken down to and she belittled me in front of customers.</Review>

Miguel was so helpful and professional. He was patient and made me feel secure with my final decision. He made sure everything was easy to understand and made car buying very simple and un-rushed.<//Review>

<Review>Overall good . Customer service could be better . Make sure you know someone who knows about cars before you buy one or lease because at first seems fine then boom here comes car problems . Oh also , when your car is taken In for work at there personal mechanic that you get because of warranty they will fix the problem and other things will start to malfunction! Cheap price ... you know the rest .<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1601300655162, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to send your feedback. We would love to speak with you.

Nadine was great! She is so professional and knowledgeable. No haggling, no wasting time. They tell you which cars you qualify for... you pick your car and your out the door. Warranty is good and a 7 day test drive with a money back guarantee. Best car buying experience we’ve ever had. Thank you nadine !</Review>

10/10 customer service! Highly recommend this place. I was in a financial bind and needed a car quick and didn’t have the best credit. Nadine Jessen helped me out and got me in a car that day for a really good deal. She was very informative and gave really good customer service. :))<//Review>

<text>Jorge made my car buying experience easy and enjoyable.  I bought a 2004 Toyota Camry with no money down.  After being sold a car that broke down two days later, coming into Carhop was my last option.   I am very relieved and looking forward to my credit building while I make my payments.  My car should last a lot longer than I'll be making payments for especially with the transmission, driving axle and engine covered under warranty for 18 months.  I am so relieved to have a reliable car with a great warranty that gets good gas mileage.  Carhop is the way to go. Ask for Jorge!</text>< GmapID>

CarHop is a way to go! Miguel Hernandez has been a very great help. Walked in determined to walk out with a car and he definitely helped me out with that. I’ve been trying to get a car for so long and today is the day I get to drive home in a new car! 10/10 would recommend to friends and family.</Review>

New year= 365 new chances. Car Hop gave me a chance no one else would and for that I am grateful. If you need a car with a warranty that covers engine transmission they got you. No other place offers what they offer and to be honest if you need a second chance in life and a car to get around and by making on time payments my credit will get better that is what I care about. If you don’t care about what car you get as long as its a car that will get you off the bus and from paying Uber carhop is the place! Thank you carhop!</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Today, I came into CarHop in National City to purchase a vehicle.  I was greeted by Nadine J., who immediately began to help me with the process of buying from CarHop.  The process took a total of one hour and through the experience, Nadine, was friendly, informative, and most of all, very professional!  Honestly speaking, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but ultimately, MY expectations were GREATLY exceeded by Nadine and the total car buying experience at CarHop, National City, CA.  Whether you're a first-time car buyer, or have purchased many vehicles, I'd, not only recommend CarHop, but I'd suggest that Nadine be your sales advocate with the process.  I'm very pleased with the CarHop experience!  Thank you so much for everything, Miss Nadine!  You were an exceptional Sales person and I'm happy to say that, YOU'VE gained another satisfied buyer today!< /Text>< pics>

Laura from Carhop saved my life. 2 years ago, I lost my father to Cancer, Lost my Job, and couldn't keep my finances in check. I was homeless and living from weekly hotels to weekly hotels. I wasn't sure if I was ever going to be able to have a car again. I promised myself that things would get better. After 1 1/2 years of perseverance, I am current now stable with my living arrangements. I was able to get a job 1 block away from my Apartment, and have worked here for a year now. When I called Laura back to see if I can get a car again, she answered, "Yes", and to come in! When I got there, I was still skeptical, I may have given the person greeting me a little bit of attitude. Only because I was so nervous because every time I get a Yes, there's always a "but," or flat No. They helped me choose from 4 different Cars! I eventually found the one I loved. I cannot thank Laura and the Staff at Carhop enough. You all have truly, given me a new sense of confidence in Life. Thank you!< /Text>

I have been a carhop costumer for two years. They have been very nice to me. I came back and traded in my first vehicle after it began to give me issues. Cynthia is my case manager and has worked with me so efficiently.  She spoke for me in such high regard. Once I got here Lana and and Nadine worked diligently to be certain that I would leave happy. They stayed well pass closing and in the end I left the lot in a car even better than I had expected.  I greatly appreciate the way they made me a priority. I am extremely happy with the way they showed how important my account is to them. Thank you carhop<//text>

My day at Car shop was very good. My dealer, Miguel Hernandez, was very helpful and patient. He showed very good positivity and was very understandable with all my questions. 5/5 for him. And I would highly recommend friends and family to be assisted with him!!!</text>

Wow! Nadine is a great asset to your company with her professional and polite service, one word knowledgeable, giving me the information about the process step by step at the beginning and following through on what she told me keeping in line with what said on the commercial. Well I will definitely will refer Carhop to everyone I can. Service was excellent and help from the staff to back it up. Keep up the good work Nadine, as a disabled veteran Carhop has given me very good start!!!  Mike, San Diego</review><user_name>Fanny Wolfe< /user_name>< Rate>

<Review>Not one place in a thousand miles radius would approve me.......

Except for Carhop. Laura went above and beyond to serve us. At first I was nervous casue it did take about 5 hours to do all the paperwork and do the process but in the end she came walking out with keys and paperwork in hand for us. I was expecting to throw 500 down but ended up driving away with no down payment to my surprise. And the payments are low! It's true what the reviews say guys, hop on down to Carhop. You won't be disappointed. Ask for Laura< /Review>< Time>

Saw a vehicle I liked from the road.
Stopped in and offered to pay cash in full for the vehicle.
They told me they could not sell me the car without a loan on the vehicle.

< review>
I have never shopped at Car Hop I took a customer there gave her lots of info not to get taken advantage of and some pointers on things she should ask for. My last job was 14 years at Landrover San Diego. I quit in 2014 no more jobs for me. I read the reviews and most are good that's not easy in a car business. So for now I have no reason to not give them a 5 star rating.<//review>

<Review>Thank you for Carhop and the sales agent Miguel Hernandez. I appreciate working with you once again and this will be the second car i’ve had with carhop. It is true that no one works very hard to get you into a vehicle but this people. I know there may be some bad reviews about them but honestly they are good working with you getting a car, not like other dealerships they get you all hyped up letting you test drive a car and ended up asking for more “Downpayments”. For those of you wanting to work getting your credit improved, I highly recommend Carhop to give them a try. trust me, I’ve been there before.

Goodluck!</Review><user_name>Joel Calimlim</user_name><Date>1579736656089< /Date><rating>5<//rating><Resp>{'time': 1579790708347, 'text': 'Hi Joel - Thanks for being a 2-time customer with CarHop. We are proud to have you as a customer again and congrats on your new vehicle!'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Jorge made my experience at Carhop an easy one! Got approved in a timely matter, reviewed my options of cars, test drove & completed my paperwork all in a hour time frame. Def recommend CarHop to anyone looking to purchase a used car for low monthly payments. Im driving off the lot very satisfied! Thank you!< /Review>

<review>Such a great experience! I totalled my car and they were able to get me into something even better! Luke was so nice and professional and Tonya, the manager, bent over backwards to take care of me and help me during a very trying situation. No other dealership would do what they did for me today. SO BLESSED!! Thanks again, Carhop!</review>< pics>

This was an enjoyable experience.  I'm so happy I came to Car hop.  Jorge had great customer service and, knew exactly what he was doing to get me in and out in 2 hours.  I left smiling and feeling great!<//Review>

Car hop is the by far the best and most affordable car dealer I’ve ever been to. Not only did I get the exact car that I asked for with a 0 down payment; but the service I received from Laura, Jorge, and the underwriter Dan specifically made my whole visit feel extremely worthwhile. I thought I would never get approved and they did everything they could to get me in a Lexus truck!! Hands down best team of people ever and the best dealership. All of my future vehicle shopping will be done at carhop no where else. I’m recommending carhop to everyone that needs a car with no money down.<//Text>

<text>Going through some tough times I needed a nice, safe and reliable car. Most importantly affordable. CarHop team and Tania were so incredibly helpful. They got me into a nice car. Ford Focus. They explained everything to me. They weren't pushy or tried to get me into something I couldn't afford. The process was pretty quick. I highly recommend CarHop for anyone seeking a great used car with flexible payment terms. Very happy with my experience here.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><UserId.>101652429833123413780<//UserId.><username>Viola Carmona< /username>< gmap_id>

Jorge really helped me out. It's been twice I've came here and always good service from Jorge. Only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the very limited options of cars that they have. That's all. Could also be a bit more well maintained. Other than that,good service and a reliable car.</Text>

Jorge was most helpful today. Helped me get a great deal on a car and was honest about the prices. There was no pressure to sell and let me know about the seven day satisfaction guaranteed. I'm happy about this purchase.

I had no credit and I'll be able to improve my credit with the loan that they gave me.</Review>

All vehicles have a generic image of the similar vehicle,
No mileage or prices on anything, I had emailed them for details they didn’t answer any of my questions and kept trying to get me to come in. I feel like I rather do my research and know what I’m buying before anything.
If they would only communicate better with their customers.<//text>

Bought a car in late December of 2018, had to get the engine replaced in March, now there’s  another issue with the catalytic converter, which needs to be replaced. I don’t recommend coming to this place unless you want to be stuck paying for a car that you continuously have to fix.  You’ll spend more money fixing the car than what’s it worth. Keep looking & never settle on this place.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>My experience here at Carhop was nothing next than great. Jorge was the salesman who helped me and he made getting into my next car really easily. He was completely transparent on the process letting me know exactly what to expect in buying a used car. He took is time and didn’t rush or try to make a quick sell and that made me feel completely at ease. I don’t have the best credit history and coming here was my best option in getting a car & fixing my credit in the process. If you’re looking for a good used car with a great salesman, come here and ask for Jorge. He will be straight up and not bs you ! Thanks Again !!!<//review>< Pics>

I did not experience anything pleasant at this location. Seeing recent complaints, I’ve decided to voice mine. We come in, we aren’t greeted, and we wait. A rude lady comes and calls us in, isn’t friendly, isn’t kind. It was overall the worst experience. Also, buy from an actual lot, your payments will be much cheaper. I now own a 2017 for $300 a month opposed to some of their outrageous payments. Skip car hop. It’s called car hop because you should hop right over it and search elsewhere. Please don’t tell me to contact you, I have no interest, I’m much happier elsewhere. If I can save one person from this company; then I did my job.</text>

Very pleasant and professional sales person named Jorge, glad I came here. Here it is 9 months later and I had pretty major mechanical problem and Laura the manager at the National City lot was major in getting my car repaired. Thank you so much.</text>

<Text>They want $800 down and we were shown 1 car. It was filthy! A cup holder is full of cigarette ashes. Another cup holder had a glob of something idek what it is. Hair all over. Hair tye, candy wrappers and someone's body spray. Not impressed 👎 business ethics to push the sale of a filthy car.  Extremely poor selection.<//Text>< Pics>

As someone who's credit is not the best I really didn't know how carhop could help me. I'm not going to lie, it was an all day process, but Miguel Hernandez found me a decent car for my budget. He put me in a safe reliable car I can say with a smile "it's mines". Thank you carhop I will be sure to tell everyone I know to come get their car from you.< /text>

My experience with Carhop was more than I expected. They have great customer service and a friendly staff. They really strive to ensure your payments are affordable and manageable. A-plus location to purchase a vehicle if you are trying to improve your credit. My salesman Jorge was very knowledgeable and pleasant to work with!</review>

Carhop is not a place I'd ever go again to get a car. The place is unreliable n hardly help with any car problems under warranty.  Sold me a car that had no breaks with a rusty rotor, no A/C, Problem with the sensory light n engine. I wish I had known better.</text>

Especially with my credit and my history with car loan places but luckily I found Carhop and the people are super friendly and helpful.  The only thing I have to say and why I didn't give them 5 stars is they need more workers you have to wait a long time cause one guy is helping 5 people at time. Meaning your time there might be 4 to 6 hours.  However with that being said everything else was excellent.  Thanks for those who got me back in the driver's seat.< /text>< pictures>

CarHop was awesome! I came in with not a whole lot to give or very good credit.  Lani explained the process to me and gave it to me straight no BS.  I was happy to know she had something for me I could use.  And with warranty!! Thank you for making this an easy process, you have truly helped me out a great deal!  See Lani and her awesome manager!<//Review>

She was very pleasant to deal with, and she got me in a nice and clean 06 chrystler 300 with no hassle in a very professional manner. I appreciate carhop and the expeditious business i received from them today and i would recommend them to anyone needing a car.

<review>I was turned down everywhere for one reason or another, poor credit, not big enough down payment, credit score too low, not enough time on my job, you name it. Carhop told me to come back at the end of the month and I did. They were very up front and knowledgeable, treated me with respect unlike other car dealers and just when I thought I was never going to get into a car, THEY SOLD ME ONE! THEY HAD ME COME OUTSIDE AND HAD IT RUNNING WITH THE LIGHTS ON DOOR OPEN, HEATER GOING (it was cold that evening) AND BASICALLY SAID HERE  IS YOUR NEW CAR! Lani was very helpful and pleasant to speak with, The new saleswoman that was in training (wish I remembered her name!) was professional and genuine Thank you.Tanya was knowledgeable, very upbeat and positive making my experience fantastic! I feel  good to be re-establishing my credit and that CARHOP gave me a chance! The price and monthly payment reasonable. They want me to succeed!  I will recommend your company and what it stands for every chance I get! THANK YOU CARHOP FOR MAKING BUYING A CAR A GOOD EXPERIENCE!<//review>< user_name>

<Review>Awesome experience! When I thought I didn't have a chance somehow they were able to approve me and even helped me save some money. Definitely, recommend Car Hop to anyone and everyone looking for another chance to get a car and work on building your credit to get back on track. Thank you Laura and Tonya!<//Review>< date>

I was amazed at how they could work with someone with poor credit such as myself and allow me to drive off the lot and a nice car. This experience in my book was very much five star.  I recommend this service to anyone out there who has given up hope on owning or buying a vehicle of your own.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Thanks Luke! You're awesome.( I wanted to edit because it honestly hadn't sunk in how great everything was) Luke got me really good payments on the car, the car is amazing and couldn't have asked or imagined anything better for my situation. Really busy on saturday so everyone ended up helping me out, you guys are life savers for real.

<Review>I was desperately in need of a vehicle, unfortunately my credit is pretty bad. I couldn't get approved anywhere... I heard Carhop was a good place for bad credit financing. Even they said NO! But Jorge understood my situation. He and his manager Laura worked with an underwriter to help me get approved.  Honorata, Jorge and Laura stayed an hour and a half after closing to get me a car that I feel comfortable with. I couldn't be any happier! Thanks a lot Carhop of National City. You guys are the best</Review>< Rating>

<Review>I am so greatful for Carhop. They saved my family's life. We were blessed to have the opportunity to meet some great staff. Jorge was awesome with us. He worked with us. My credit is very bad and they still put me in a car within my budget and that fits my large family. Brianna was awesome also. I recommend this place to everyone who is having a problem getting a car. 5 Stars for Carhop in National City!!!< /Review>< rate>

I didn’t know what to expect but they were extremely helpful and got me into a car and start building my credit back. No more hours on the bus! I like their slogan, too:

“Let’s get you driving today.”

Thanks, guys!!<//Review>< userid>

<Review>Came to here after constantly not getting approved or high down payments at other car dealerships. Sure enough Luke was able to assist me with any questions I had and I was able to drive off with a car in a matter of Minute. If you are not at car hop then you are at the wrong dealership. COME AND SEE LUKE!!</Review>< rate>

<Text>I have been giving a second chance from carhop along with my Fiancée we were helped out by Jorge and this time around we were explained everything he answered every question we had and he made sure he just got right to it . A lot of people will just do what they have to for  their own financial sub stance but Jorge made us feel very comfortable with giving it another chance. Being able to make a decision and knowing someone’s gonna work with you is the best comfort. Thank you Jorge for not beating around the bush & great customer service .</Text>< Pictures>

Wow. Words cannot describe how grateful I am for Laura! She really made it happen for me! I came to Carhop one year ago and wasn't able to get into a vehicle. But I said I will work hard and be able to come back. One year later I came back to the best customer service I've ever experienced! Laura's kind and caring words as well as determination helped me get a CAR!!! If you are looking for a place where they will do everything they can and with a smile, come here! Now I can start living my life and enjoy the reason I moved here to San Diego! THANK YOU LAURA AND CARHOP TEAM! You guys made me feel so welcomed! I am honored to be your customer!< /Text>

I highly recommend coming here if you have been denied at numerous car lots. They were determined to help me and get me into a car despite the issues with my credit. And after applying twice and getting denied, I came back a third time after doing what was suggested and I am getting ready to drive off in my car. Tonya was extremely helpful and very patient/understanding of my situation. She was a great help and I'm glad to be a customer of carhop!</Text>

Lani was very efficient and descriptive about the details of purchasing a vehicle from car hop. She exhibited warmth, smile and genuine concern about me leaving the premises today driving. I would buy a car from her again and I will refer friends and associates to ask for Lani when coming to car hop. She showed that she is compassionate and will get the job done. You have a quality employee.<//review>

My wife and I had an excellent experience at car hop last. We were able to get a car at a reasonable price because of the helpful staff members and I'm very satisfied with the service. I'm very grateful there's a company like CarHop that gives people second chances.< /text>

Luke was AMAZING!!!! He asked all the questions and answered mine before i could ask. He really does cater to your needs but also your budget. My suggestion is when you come here be open and not defensive to what they’re telling you because they are trying to help you out with what you came for! I will be back!<//review>

I walked in with low hopes b/c my credit is So low but am walking out with a new (to me) car and a 0 down payment. Definitely exceeded my expectations and were super friendly !

UPDATE 1/18/19
This is my 2nd time shopping with carhop. I came in to trade in the car I had previously purchased and Jorge S was the absolute best. He worked super hard to get me a car 9 yrs newer than my old one and for 0 down. They are a bit expensive but with poor credit history and little money for a down payment they really do their best to help you out.<//text>

I went in hoping for the best because of all their good reviews but the lady that assisted me had 0 interest in helping me. I had been declined but she didnt try to help me with alternate options at all. We went to the car dealer next door and they helped me right away and I got approved with them because they tried different methods to help me get approved and didnt quit the first try like these guys. Overall a bland experience. The worker was just not into helping me.<//text>

All I can say is I have had several car buying experiences and this was the first time that I really believed what my sales man Jorge said and that he had my best  interest at heart. He was very professional, caring,and understanding.I didnt feel rushed, nor did I feel like he was just trying to make a sale. At one point I even said they should have more salesmen and women like him. Overall my experience with Car Hop was one of the best I've ever had...Thank you JORGE, Tanya, and Luke

<user>101328007501258385778<//user><Review>Came in here for an upgrade on my car. Jorge helped me with everything. Made everything easy, explained everything throughly, saw the car's history and tried to do everything in his power to give me the best deal. If you come in, ask for Jorge. He was honest and catered to my needs. Thanks Jorge.

So, this is an update and edit on this place. Getting the car was so awesome and smooth. Super fast and they did everything for me. However. After I got the car, was making timely payments, the car started to give me trouble. And I mean, one thing after another, things would go so wrong. I dumped over $3000 into the car, trying to fix everything on it. I called the dealership, and told them what was going on, they didn't care. They were rude, treated me like I was an animal. I asked for payment extensions, because I was always having my car worked on. They cut off my car through the starter interrupt, and stranded me over $70 dollar missed payment. I had to bypass the starter interrupt, just so I would not be stranded 50 miles from my home. They emailed me nasty letters, which I saved, because I was going to take them to court. The car finally died on me, refusing to start, the whole car system dying on me. I begged and pleaded and asked to trade my car in for another car, and I would continue to make payments. They didn't care. They only wanted their money. So after my car died, I let my car sit, and left the GPS on the car on, and left them come take it. Even up to the moment they took the car, they hounded me to make the payments. They wrote nasty emails and left messages on my phone, which I finally had enough. I finally bought a brand new car, through Kia of El Cajon. Awesome, awesome car. Do not ever, under any circumstances, go to this dealership. They are a fraud. There are ways to get a better car and a better deal than this scam.< /Review><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

I am so so thankful that I was able to walk away with a car today. I walked in thinking I wasnt going to get approved at all because I  got denied by every dealership.
They were able to work with my credit score and let me tell you it is very poor. But let me tell you I got approved and I want to say a very Big Thank You to Jorge!!! Now I get to provide for my daughter and continue working.< /Review>

So for me with my credit as low as it is, I was not sure of how things will work out for me, but it was by the grace of God that I got approved!!!

Terrible warranty policies when it comes to the shops they pick. None are official car dealers or mechanic shops, all are mom-and-pops shops that cut Car Hop a deal. Most these places are in the same area so if your vehicle breaks down far from them..you will pay more for towing than the issue is actually worth fixing..please consider this before using Car Hop.< /Text>

<Text>Great experience here.  My former vehicle was almost 18 years old and finally gave out due to a faulty repair where I was left with little in savings and received under $1000 for the value of the vehicle.  I looked up carhop and decided to head down to look at what they had to offer.
Jorge was the gentleman who helped me and he did a great job.  He presented the process of how the company operates and set expectations at the beginning of the interaction.  He even gave me possibilities of the vehicles I could be approved for before we even ran my credit and was pretty much spot-on with what I qualified for after the fact.  Jorge was extremely patient while I test drove the vehicles to make a decision and made me not feel pressured about one vehicle over the other which I greatly appreciated.
In the end, I left with a vehicle that was much better than what I expected and I definitely recommend this place to anyone who needs a pre-owned vehicle and is looking for a good value.  Ask for Jorge, he’s really great!</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
My name is Christian Ramirez I spent 8 months with Hyundai sonata 06 before I traded it in for an Kia forte Fe 20 from team Kia of El cajon which by the way would recommend more than carhop. In the last 8 months I paid alot in repairs, I found rust on my oil, I had to change battery in less than a month, tires didn't even last 3 months, rotors were used up and breaking pads were old and rusty too, right axles was like if they weilded two parts together making one axles which it still made a weird noise two months after i lease the car. The trunk only closed when it felt like it, interior I found sticky old candy under the seats and broken parts hidden by the doors, the name sonata kept falling letter by letter. They also tell you if any occurrence should happen that u can't make a payment u can call in and they can help you out with an extension or something, but that's a lie my first late payment was 5 months after I leased the car and they didn't gave me a chance they told me if I didn't make my payment soon they were going to disconnect my starter, which by the way it sounds more of a threat than a lending hand. I came in with the need of a vehicle and they took advantage, Nadine was my sales person she was new during the time but she knew how to take advantage of the situation, they act like they care but they only care for that signature. For future buyers I recommend you give team Kia of El cajon a try before coming here to carhop.<//Review>

< Review>
I had a pretty decent experience. I’ve been here several times before, however, this is my first time actually purchasing a vehicle. Jorge was nice, professional, and was as honest as he could be without harming the business lol. He was extremely patient with me as I made a lot of request because I’m slightly picky. I didn't give 5 stars because some of the information changed on a vehicle that I really wanted, HOWEVER, I’m walking out with a nice car and an overall great experience. Let me just add, don’t take everyone’s negative experiences and think it’s always like that. While I was in the office I had someone tel me they’re crooks and so on and so forth, however, people tend to get really upset when they can’t have their way. 🤷🏾‍♀️<//Review>

This place is the best things that's happened to me in a while. My dealer Jorge is a super outstanding guy, he did everything in he's power to make sure I walked away with a car. And guess what I don't have the greatest credit but I'm walking out of here with a 04 Monte Carlo. I couldn't be more happy for myself. I honestly wanna say thank you so much Jorge. You are the real MVP of this year.</Text>

<Review>Corporate definitely is full of issues. They told me one thing and the store told me another. Fortunately, I have many friends who have offered to assist in a class action or possible suite for their illegal business practices as well as the BBB. They will not approve you even if you’re qualified, do not help you, and show no interest in your interests. They just want you in and out. Anyone who five stars this is legitamely either their staff, or absolutely ghetto . If you’ve had a bad issue with them too, contact the BBB and hopefully we’ll start the class action by January. Do not buy from them.<//Review>< Pics>

Jorge was not only paitent with me, but he helped me understand the system of how CarHop works. I came in Saturday of November 17 with no experience of buying a car off the lot. They help you with no or bad credit which was a big plus for me. Now I am driving off the lot with my new car November 19. Thank you CarHop!!!!!</review>

I honestly thought with all the bad reviews that my time was going to be wasted but Tonya helped me through the long process of car buying and I would say that she deserves all the recognition possible 5 stars on her customer service, effort, friendliness, professionalism!

<user_name>Wendy Brocatto< /user_name><text>This is my second time coming to CarHop. My first experience allowed me the opportunity to increase my credit score significantly enough to where I was able to purchase a brand new car after a year! A car accident left me without a car and I have returned to a very warm welcome. I have to say that if you truly need help purchasing a vehicle and are having a hard time finding someone to finance you, you definitely should stop by and talk to them. Thank you CarHop for hooking me up once again!</text>< rating>

Jorge Soriano is the main man his quirky fun and friendly customer service is top notch. He was quite the busy bee last Friday and I was shocked that I got pre-approved for a car! No money down got me a GMC Envoy! Got the check engine light on but no sweat I was told by Lester from Pacific Auto Repair to make an appointment. Would highly recommend to those with bad credit needing a second chance at getting a used vehicle.  28 month loan and cheap monthly payments mine is $404 a month.<//Review>

I'd go someplace else to buy a car. Continually said that payments weren't made when they were made and in advance, no less. I'd get a call stating a late or missed payment and that the starter on my car would be disabled if I didn't immediately make a payment. Too much time wasted on the phone with their employees to rectify the situations because they were too lazy to look in the correct parts of their database.<//Review>

Nicole definitely helped me all the way out today. Before coming here I left a dealership that claimed to be able to help me out regardless of the circumstance.  At the end of the visit they tried to put me in a car with almost 200,000 miles on it with a CRAZY monthly payment. I came to CarHop expecting the worst, and I'm pulling off the lot with the best car I've ever owned, all thanks to Nicole. It's been a rough week but after today, I think things are gonna start to look up. Thank you again Nicole! You the real MVP!!!!</Text>

Man! This place definitely has its purpose. If you need a step in building your credit this is a good place to start. And the GM Tanya OMG!!!!this girl is in need of a clone. She's great a so efficient wearing evey hat in the office. She deserves a raise and a larger staff. But overall I had a good experience< /Review>

BUYERS BEWARE!!! Proced at Your Own Risk! Bad service, long wait, lack of customer oriented attitude and they were trying to get me into a ten year old car with hundreds of thousands of miles for the price of a new car. Just go to Mossy Nissan at Chula Vista</review>

I went there because I was pre approved on line for a car. The payments are outrageous, starting at $350 and up. They practically pick your car and a high interest rate. The plan is to help low income, bad, no credit situation. But unless you are going to live in your car, with low income it might be hard to keep up with the payments. In my opinion..< /review>

So this company does not honor their limited warranty for the vehicles they sell. I took my mother 3 the very next day into one of their preferred shops. They waive the deductible fee they were gonna charge me for $75! Well thanks for that! My car is hitting metal to metal in the back on the back axle! And they were supposed to have ordered the part said the shop to me when they told me the reason why they didn't replace it when I took it to begin with. They couldn't even change the air filter on the car! God knows what they actually did because I believe they did nothing. Finally because I put a Google review online about car hop the manager Flash vice president  Called me for the very 1st time I got a call back actually. They had forgotten to order the part the auto part place ordered the park it came in on Friday a week ago due to my availability I was unable to go till today today! So I go there this morning 9:00 a.m. and I in there for about 45 minutes if that  They tell me my car is ready they show me the tires are kind of screwed up in the back I need to new back tires and reality I need 4 new tires  Cause they're all badd and I drive away and the same noise is happening this same metal to metal clanking in the back is happening the mechanic drove my car the very 1st day I took it and today and how the h*** does he not know what the problem is and why the h*** would he fix it is my question this company is awful  Stupid awful I can't even describe the anger and the  The disregard they have for the customers that pay out the a** for these pieces ship cars that they sell them this company doesn't even deserve one star so now I'm getting in trouble at work because I have to still continue to take my car back again to get it repaired because now they said they fixed the front axle but the noises in the back lol</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Im highly impressed and satisfied with the customer service at car hop. My car sale person was Miss Nadine. She made my car buying experience a memorable one. She was fast, efficient and got me a great deal. Shes been by far the Best. I would defenetly recomend going to car hop and asking for Miss Nadine if youre in need of a car.

I don’t recommend buying here they sell you cheap
Cars for more than they are worth and their interest is high. Check out other places!!< /review>

This review is for my skeptics...
If you are reading this review more than likely you dont have perfect credit and little or no down payment but need a reliable car. Long story short I was a skeptic myself. Like you i read almost ever review before making my decision. I previosuly bought a car off craigslist and to no surprise it has stopped working. I needed a car ASAP to get around in. I didnt want to settle for anything so here I am. I bought my car Saturday and took it to Midas Monday for an inspection. My 2005 Nissan Exterra is in perfect condition inside and out. Midas stated that the only thing I need to have looked at is what they are calling a blend door actuator. This is not a problem except is makes a noise when the car turns on but it will do no harm if not bolted down. Outside of getting new tires I need NO work done and I am very grateful for that. The cars they carry are from 2000 to 2014 so please dont go in with the mindset that you will walk out with something new. This place is great for people with troubled credit or no credit and low down payments. Best part off it will be paid off in 2 years!!!  Thank you guys for selling me a great car :)

PS: Go see Jorge...He will defintely take care of you. As he always say just be honest and they will be able to help .< /Review>

Sittin on my couch after working long hours and taking the bus for 2 hours carhop commercial comes up and i said i have to go try it. I was sick and tired of walking to work and taking uber and lyft was takibg all my money. i walked to carhop and leave with a car leave with an opportunity to help myself get better in life. no more blisters on my feet. Car Hop is a great program to help people drive. with bad credit and no money down i was approved. i can take my kids to school and no more walking. they are a blessing. thank you to the carhop team that made it possible. Jorge, Nadine, Laura you guys are the best! i recommend everyone tgat needs a car go to carhop they will help you!<//Text>

Luke, is a very professional salesman.  He made my whole car buying experience a pleasure,  with his jovial personality and his empathetic  anecotes.  I highly recommend CarHop, based on Luke's wonderful service.  This world needs more people like him!!!

Thank you soooo much Luke, may God continue to bless you and your family.  Keep up the excellent work, and thanks for a hand up and not a slap down.  You are the best, and 2018 will be a great year for you; because what you put out in this world does come back to you.  Positive vibes right back at ya!!!

I expect a wedding invite....lol...jk</review>

<review>Such an amazing experience over at CarHop National City, i went in with the mindset that i may not get approved due to getting a car repossessed in april but thankfully i was able to leave today with a ford escape i honestly cant believe it, but im so happy i cant thank Tonya enough for finding me exactly what i was looking for and putting in the time and effort to allow me to drive off the lot today!! I definitely recommend getting a car here especially if you have a low credit score and are also looking to rebuild your credit!< /review>< Pictures>

Haven't gone in yet however, is there a reason this place has 4.8 stars on Google and 1.5 stars on Yelp? There's got to be something going on.

Will see when I go in.< /review>

When I bought my car almost 2 years ago now I was at the dealer for 8 hours. And well it honestly didn't feel like it. It wasn't their fault I was picky with my vehicle and of course waiting for aproval is always time consuming. And they were awesome. During the times I needed to wait on the finance department they were reassuring and even had a conversations with me just to keep me from loosing my mind. Haha Definitely a good company.</review>

< Review>
I am a first time buyer from a carlot, i was very nervous and anxious about it. Right away i was welcomed by a smiling face which at that point felt a bit more at ease. I was then seated and the ball was rolling. I had an amazing woman by the name of Megan help me out. Let me just say you want her on your side. She was just absolutely wonderful! Even with my very low credit score she worked with me and got me a BEAUTIFUL car that im more than happy to drive of the lot with. Thank you carhop! I will most definetly recommend this company to any and everyone looking for a reliable yet decent car. (many MANY options) & a special thank you to Megan i very much grateful for your time and services THANK YOU!!!!!!<//Review>

<GmapID>0x80d952400d234b27:0x49dfc7c1a837013e< /GmapID><Review>Financed a Mazda3 07.  Right off the lot it it had issues so I took it the very next day to one of there preferred mechanics.  They did some of the repairs and completely ignored the starting issue.  They also said they had to order parts.  And it's been almost 2 weeks and
I have been getting nothing but the run around.  I left a message with carhop in national city today and am still waiting for a call back.  They never call back tho... so far this company is all talk that there customer is #1 and all they SHOW is it's not!
And to carhop representatives, dont reply to this review with ur standard message that customer service in important...cuz it isnt! U should take better care of ur customers since u already overprice ur broke down vehicles...I'm sure u guys are making a lot of money selling cars u should appreciate that by taking care of us!

Just like I thought no one ever called me back and when I finally talked to the mechanic at the auto repair place  They told me that car op forgot to order the parts horrible customer service Horrible place to buy a car these people should be sued and out of business<//Review>< username>

Best Location to help when your down with No/Bad credit, & Low down payments, Luke is the Man!!
Got me a Toyota Camry, happy to be Helped and not treated bad.

Edit: after 6 months I would like to recall my review and thoughts on my purchase and carhops lack of customers service after you purchase. All was great for the wife for fist month till starter and alternator gave up, they got it fixed but then brakes started making noises, then battery gave out. After 6 months making auto pay on time, miss one time cause all 4 tires need change and have no money to pay they threatened to turn off car and won't be able to drive even with their miss a payment autopay.. Plus my credit score barely got updated with as many as 12 on time payments. All in all had bad experiences with a Lemon automobile from a two side dealership...I should pursue California Lemon Law on them selling such Messed up vehicle's. Not a happy customer for a 3,000$ car that I'm paying quadruple pay for it to need repairs monthly.< /text>

<text>Horrible Customer service! My co worker just got a car from them a few months ago and last week it breaks down on the freeway. Luckily she still has a warranty to get it fixed. Anyway, the auto shop is saying they don't know how long its gonna take and The manager at Car Hop sounded rushed, unprofessional, & very careless. She then proceeds to say that she still needs to pay and they do not offer any loaner car to get to and from work. In other words they do not care that they sold a lemon car. My Co Worker had just referred me to them last month since i was car shopping. But i will defiantly stay away from CAR HOP. i just feel so bad for her. hope they do get it worked out for her though :/< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>So you go in to get a car, and you get one which is a good thing. I'm sure many people had good experiences with car hop. But MINE, mine was not good. I was hoping to write a good review but I go in and 3 hours later after leaving the water pump bust and something with the engine. Took it THEIR mechanic next day, Saturday morning oct.6 even though it was overheating and smoking. I call week later to see whats happpening and they tell me i should have it back forsure Oct 16 monday. So i just finally get a call back oct.19 (today) saying they just got the piece yesterday. Why didn't I get a call then if I'm a worried customer?! But all in all, in the call they said i won't get it till oct. 25. Two and half weeks to wait for a couple parts, and worse thing is i missed a bunch of work since I'm a delivery driver. I had a busted car and that's why I came to a dealership, so I don't have to worry about nothing being broken. Guess not. I hope everyone else has a good experience at least. Sorry car hop, I'm not gonna right a good review if it ain't deserved.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1508798627059, 'text': 'Hello Mathew --Thank you for your feedback.

<text>Great expierence here at car hop. I had a repo on Tuesday and on Friday I had a car. It wasn't brand new like my Kia Soul but it was better than walking. Tonya was really great and very honest with me. I got into a Chevy Impala and I love it. I really should not even be in a car but thanks to car hop I can drive in a car instead of asking for rides, taking a bus, or wasting money on uber all the time. Thanks Tonya 😊😍</text>< pictures>

After trying to gey a car at several other dealerships and consistently being turned down, we found a great choice at carhop. not only was it exactly what we wanted, tonya the sales rep who helped us did amazing work with the financing even though my credit was not the best. I got my first car for under seventy dollars a week! I am so happy i came to carhop, and Ill definately be recomending to friends to come here first.<//text>

<text>I purchased a Ford expedition 6 days ago I only drove it home and to and from the grocery store. ..last night I drove it to Alpine just 40 miles east of San Diego. The engine made an aweful sound and started running rough so I pulled off to have a look. I checked the oil and there was white film around the oil cap thick like butter. I asked a gentleman who worked there and he said it probably has a blown head casket. That the white substance is water in the oil. I am documenting this so I can get my less than 7 day money back guarantee. I will give a better review if they keep to thier promise of a money back guarantee. I would give them 0  Stars right now. Teresa Russell San Diego...

Well they fixed it. A week and a half later. They did push back my car payment a month. To compensate for the taxis I had to take, home from where it broke down and to the shop to pick it up. Not counting numerous other uber rides.

Well its a month later... My engine has overheated two times in a 2 week period . ....for IAlso had to take it in for the air conditioning. ..it stopped working. Now its time to make a payment.  I cant even depend on this car to make it out of the drive. Well back to the shop. They informed me the wouldnt push back the payment again... I get it.Duh.... 6 days would be money back quarentee....2 months Im screwed.

<Review>Laura was so great in helping me and my boyfriend. Its our first time getting a new car and they explained everything. Its really a great first experience and recommend anyone to come here. Thank You CarHop.
--4months later.. We had a recent problem with our car, of course my boyfriend isnt much of a great english speaker and needs help to understand a few things but at least HELP not TELL him the things he has to do , go thru the process and actually Help . I het that webonly get 30days in the beginnig but what about after , after what was supposebly FIXED was the problem we were back for AGAIN.. and i read a review on here saying these reviews are fake of course not , reason why there are all GOOD reviews is because they have us put down a review the FIRST day we purchase a car there , OF COURSE they get good reviews we got a car! Where are the reviews of the complaints AFTER the purchase, we have heard multiple. We are just one out of many im sure. Still consider Laura as a really good help. But still thanks Carhop i mean we still got the car but be more HELPFUL please.<//Review><Rate>3< /Rate><Date>1459035912018</Date>< username>

< review>
Changing my review, after 6 days I took my car for a check up for a grinding noise it was making, come to find out there were no pads left on the car, the rotors were bad and the gasket was blown. Before I got the car I mentioned a burning smell to Jorge and he said that's just how old cars smell, did not mention anything about the gasket. Had to wait a couple hours to find out that they approved to cover the cost even though it wasn't covered by the warranty and they said they didn't have to cover the parts but they were still going to. Upset that they sold me a car that was unsafe in the first place, no have to miss work and try to find a ride because my cars going to take 2 days, finance company says "things happen" and we are still expecting the first payment, girl was rude as hell and lied to me about my account manager calling me. Only reason I gave 2 stars is because they're covering the parts but beware about the car your getting. Also get it checked on your test drive so your sales person doesn't lie to you smh. They also tell you to write a review after completing your paperwork when they know your happy, that's why they probably have good reviews. Not a lot of people come back to edit their post. Also good luck trying to speak with your account manager after you have problems because you will only go in a circle.< /review>

Staff are liars. Promised to hook my friend up, "we finance everyone," it's just a hook to get you in. They can't help anyone low income.</Text>

Carhop has been a god send in my time of need, They are understanding to my circumstances, while i have tried other dealers that were unproductive for me Carhop was excellent, not to mention Luke Vogel Carhop Representative and Tonya- National city branch manager who was kind, professional, and courteous, I would recommend Carhop to anyone who deserves a second chance.<//Text>

Wouldn't recommend buying a car from carhop I bought my car in march2018 have have the fuel pump replace 2 months after I got it , my electrical system 5 months , and now my catalytic converter carhop isn't helpful I called them plenty of times about the warranty they said they couldn't do nothing I would never buy a car from here ever again.</Review>

The positive reviews on here have GOT to be fake by their own employees or others CarHop has paid to write them ... just search on Google for "CarHop Complaints" ... there are numerous complaints from all locations in the USA where CarHop operates ... I'm surprised that States Attorneys-General have not yet filed a case against them ...< /Text>
