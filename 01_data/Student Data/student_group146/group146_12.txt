<Text>I placed an online order on Thu Jan 7th 2021.  Told delivey date would be FEB 3rd between 12-4 pm. Then told late aftenoon of the 3rd that it won't be arriving today, and that they would call us and let us know when.

NOTE: we live less than 10 miles from the manufacturing plant yet they won't let us pick it up and it's has taken nearly a month and we still don't have it. Shipper says they have no paperwork on my table and I'm now going back-and-forth between Earthlite and shipper Ceva.

Cost:  $951.83 + Shipping $73.77    Tolal:  $1025.60<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dc74dfaee7fa0d:0xa93e5d1bebdda164<//Gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rating>1</rating><username>Mike Hebert</username><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I ordered a table case for my 2001 table. They didn't have the original case but sent one that would fit my table.  Customer service was very good and the case came within a week.  My only problem is that I liked the original case better.  The pocket for the bolster was vertical and had separate pockets for sheets and other items.  The new one has one pocket which the bolster slides in horizontally and you have to put the sheets and other items on top of that.  Also, the original case's zippers went down to the bottom which made putting in the folded table easy.  The new zippers don't go down to the bottom and you have to lift the table and insert it in just right in order to zip up the case.

I just bought an Earthlite Massage Chair and am pleased with it so far.  The carrying case could be a little bigger so if you don't collapse the chair just right, it will still fit around the chair.

My table has lasted 14 years!!!  I hope my chair does, too!
-Miles of smiles :-) :-) :-)

<review>Phenomenal service. Very informative about their products. Although there's no display or showroom they bring out the product for you to try. This is where the products are manufactured so don't expect IKEA. Quality product also. I've used their tables and chairs for over 15 years and no complaints.< /review><userid>102907053441513384124< /userid>< date>

I ordered the Earthlite Spirit Massage table package as well as a table cover flannel sheets and regular sheets and other massage warehouse products. I have to say so far the table is holding up very well. I hope it will last a very long time for me. Great comfortable table and was the top seller Table with 3inch foam and adjustable headrest.  Love the products I have ordered.</Text>

I bought my portable Earthlite Avalon table when I began my training to become a massage therapist in September.  It is very manageable to transport to class and to clients' homes and the height of the table is easy to adjust.  My clients have expressed that the table is very comfortable as well.  Many students in my class have a different brand (that is more expensive) and my Earthlite is very comparable to their tables.  I am very happy with my purchase and when I set up my own business I will definitely purchase another Eartlite!< /text>

I absolutely love my Earthlite products. The quality is outstanding! I have an older table but have recently purchased bolsters, sheets and a cart for this table. The table is a portable one that I acquired from another therapist. It has proven to be one of the best purchasing decisions I have made. Since the products I have already had proven the test of time, wear and tear I put them through daily, I did not have to think twice when going back to Earthlite to purchase a massage chair for my daughter in her practice. The folks are the best to work with at Earthlite and there is no reason to go anywhere else for our future needs. Thank you!</Text>

Hi All, Bad News! Earthlite claims to offer high quality, best in the business products and I believed them. Within 4 years the massage table vinyl on 4 tables started to fall apart. The company claims they made a mistake and purchased biodegradable vinyl. My past experience with them was great, I had purchased two tables from them in 1996 and they are still in great shape. Now the company is NOT willing to replace the tables. They claim they are out of warranty! They will offer a 35% discount to replace them, which isn't good enough. They made the mistake, not me. The big mistake I made was in trusting  Earthlite.</text>

I ordered a replacement leg and face cradle cushion for a massage chair.
Customer service was pleasant to deal with when odering the leg replacement.
Ordering the face cradle cushion was easy to do online, and a better price than other sites I had searched through.
Both items were received quicker than the expected delivery.  Very pleased with both ways of ordering replacement parts for my massage chair.< /Text>

<review>I purchased your stool. It is very comfortable and I love that it adjusts higher and lower than others I have used in the past.
I wish I had gone with the beige color. Instead I got the black and it shows every hand print.  =/  And ....not sure about the upholstery. The hand prints don't just wipe away.< /review><rating>3< /rating><gmap_id>0x80dc74dfaee7fa0d:0xa93e5d1bebdda164<//gmap_id>< response>

I love this place!
Great products, excellent value, and knowledgable, professional service.
I own 2 Spirit tables and also have a Luna for outcalls.  Clients often remark on how comfortable the tables are, and I feel confident with the work load and stability.
I also feel fortunate my studio isn't too far away, I can save on shipping and pop over to their warehouse to pick up supplies like oil and sheets, and to check out what's in their "discontinued" bin :)
Thanks, Earthlite!</Text>

Nice table, strong and wide.  For Chiropractic use the head rest paper holder does not release the paper smoothly for a fast pull and rip move.  You have to slowly feed it....The face piece is just ok.   It's nice looking and adjustable in height.  It will do for a room that doesn't see a lot of patients.< /Review>

<review>I have come to loathe having to contact a companies customer service department lately - not sure how companies keep surviving with terrible customer service, but I was pleasantly surprised with Earthlite! I spoke to a Ramona who wasn't only friendly and professional, she actually helped me to quickly get done what I needed without any hassles and provided the least amount of down time for the company... I am now purposefully taking the time to write the good reviews - saves time that way as there are too many bad ones. This company earned my business for sure today!< /review><user>109806458893583187434< /user><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>I bought a portable Earthlite massage table back in about 1998.  Recently, during a move, I lost one of the knobs that secures the wooden piece for adjusting leg length. I called and talked with a delightful representative who most graciously provided me with the information I needed and got a replacement knob to me in just a couple of days!  I highly recommend Earthlite's massage table and commend the the company for wonderful customer service!</text>< pics>

<text>I've had an Earthlite portable massage table for 10 years -- I think it's a Harmony.  It has held up very well under frequent use, averaging about once per week.  It is very sturdy.  While portable, I would say it is more luggable as it isn't light and a bit awkward but there is the trade off for being sturdy.  Even with all the use, it still looks new.  If I had too, I would buy another but this one is holding up and look forward to another 10 years!< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Very easy people to deal with, and the table is beautiful.  The only glitch was that it was "dropped" at the bottom of the stairs of my office, and I had to scramble to have someone carry this enormous piece up to my office.  Apparently I chose "curbside" delivery when I ordered it??  I have absolutely no recollection of this, and would never have chosen it to be delivered this way.  I wasn't very happy at delivery time.  But the customer service were very kind just the same.</Text>

Heavier than I thought it would be. The Luna has an aluminum frame and is stable, but I owned a wooden table and wanted something light. The Luna is lighter, but definitely not easy to carry upstairs or long distances.<//text>

<Review>All went well though the driver's direction was to leave the container at curbside.

This made it almost impossible to bring into the building since its weight was over 300 lbs.

Fortunately with a $20 tip the driver was obliging and helped to deliver the table to the door of the room in which it was to be placed.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

We ordered our "spirit" table from Earthlite. It did arrive quickly. As we set it up we noticed that the legs have to be extended carefully as there is no support (unlike a much cheaper table we have)connecting the two legs from either end with each other, thus there is a risk of breaking part of the table if you do not hold both legs, one in each hand and move them simultaneously. As soon as we set it up and tested it out, one of the bed supports snapped. We called Earhtlite and left a message to which we never got a response. I called back and talked to someone who said it would be forwarded on and I should expect a call back. We did not get a return call so I called again. I explained my dilemma and this time they forwarded me on to one of their associates. I explained the situation and how we had clients booked expecting to have this additional table. Earthlite seemed indifferent to my plight and the fact that we had to call and move clients. We had to wait five days to get a replacement despite them being 5 hours away.
The Sierra Comfort table we had first is not as wide but seems just as sturdy and comfortable yet cost 1/5th the price.</review>

< Review>
The products are made well. What I did not like was the limited amount of replacement parts available for sale. I have a harmony with a broken wood panel on the front end. I was disappointed to discover that Earthlite does not have things like this available for purchase. I called and a operator told me they don't do that. Well I think they should it would increase their profits as well as customer loyalty. Maybe some day until then, here's hoping.<//Review>

Purchased 3 Earthlite table warmers for 3 different tables over 3 years.  One quit working after a month and I called and they sent another within 7 days.  Other than that they are thick, warm and temp control has auto shutoff.  It curls at the edges on 2 of the 3 for some reason and thats annoying.  But overall, I like them.<//Text>

I'm disappointed. The elastic band of the new massage chair replacement cover is quite snug and when the seat cover is placed over the seat, it looks absolutely perfect - just like in the picture. BUT, when you sit on it and work on your client/patient and get up again, the back side has pulled up a bit and the seat cover gets wrinkly and looks dumb and messy. Not just a little bit - it's quite obvious. I've pulled it back many times now, and even tried overcompensating for the sliding by really making it as tight as possible in the back, but it creeps creeping up and looks stupid. The elastic band should probably be a drawstring as I want to make it way tighter than the band can do by itself. I might bring in some thread and try tightening the bottom band more if possible (it might tear?). Or maybe I'll try stapling it on with a powerful stapler. I would have rather purchased the whole base with the seat cover stapled to the bottom for $50 or whatever because this is just dumb. I don't have time for this.< /Review>

I purchased my first table from you about twenty years ago. It was in perfect condition when I sold after fifteen years prior to my world traveling adventures. Now settled down again with a new set of clients, of course my choice was EarthLite.

Being pretty disappointed in, yet understanding of, the disguise of free shipping, I'll advise this company to make more bold the fine print that speaks of exclusions to that coupon.

An even greater disappointment was the promise of a three-business-day delivery. This important lesson taught me to wait to schedule clients until products arrive! Over the course of the next eight days, my trips to the post office twenty minutes away only led to further disgust because of the seemingly missing table. Low and behold, a voicemail finally comes from Fed-Ex stating the package had been there for about a week. How was I to know Fed-Ex didn't deliver to post offices? I wish I knew that piece of apparently common knowledge. This information needed to be posted in bold font when purchasing on-line!

And now for the great news...EarthLite agreed! They refunded the expensive shipping costs, and they even said 'thank you' for bringing this to their attention. Each of the customer service department members I had the pleasure of politely whining to was kind, patient, and willing to listen and take action.
Good going, EarthLite!</text>

<text>do NOT get your nails done by the dude... i think his name was kevin... he didn’t even finish my nails. he didn’t clean it up at all and the sides aren’t even painted! there are literal BUBBLES if you look close enough. i wanted coffin nails but he made them so thick at the top and when i told him to make it skinnier, he just said “I KNOW I KNOW” really rudely but never made them skinnier... the other ladies are good at this place though, my friends nails all look fine but mine... it looks like i did my nails myself they look so bad.....<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I went in for a gel manicure & pedicure. The lady told me $65. I thought to myself that’s a lot but whatever I need them done. I’m sitting in the chair and I look over at a sign that says manicure & pedicure $35. I asked her why am I paying $30 more just for gel? She said because of the difference in the polish. I said again $30 more for a polish difference?! The lady then started talking in a different language. I said ok it’s fine. Thinking to myself I will never come back here again! Not even a day later one of my gel nails just pops right off. I go in and fix it and they couldn’t match the color. Next day (2 days after I got them done) 3 nails completely just off my nail bed. They will charge you completely outrageous price for a simple manicure pedicure and it doesn’t even last a week. Complete rip off! I have came to them for 3 years but that time was my last!!

I've frequented this salon for many years. Fast, efficient, clean and best bang for your buck ($30 Mani and pedicure that comes with a FREE brow waxing). Linda (owner) is so cool and all of the technicians are professional and skilled!<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>First time I went it was great, but I decided to go again and I will not ever be going back. First, lady filed so hard on my nails she cut my skin on my fingers. Second, I asked for a very simple color and they didn’t understand me so I tried again and then they didn’t get it right so I politely told them it was not correct and they got mad and yelled. Third, she was about to put the top coat on and I asked her nicely to put another coat of color on my nails and she straight up told me “NO”. And lastly I didn’t want to tip anything after my experience but I figured ok a few bucks, well I was almost told to tip $5 by them when I didn’t want to tip that much and somehow in the end I did tip $5 because she started saying something I couldn’t understand. That’s my experience.</Review>< pictures>

Busiest nail salon I've ever been to but I was taken care of quickly and kindly. I live in San Leandro but my friend suggested I go here because of their great work. Already got my fill this week and will be going back soon!</Review>

They have the best gel manis. Im really hard on my nails,and where other salons will only last a week for me, the gel polish here seriously lasts for weeks. The only reason they're a 4 not a 5 for me is because the last time I went by they were closed and there was nothing indicating why since it was still business hours according to their sign.</Text>

My favorite place for a quick mani pedi. Staff is always friendly. I've moved out of the area but still stop by whenever I can. You cannot beat the service and I appreciate seeing the measures they take to maintain a clean facility.</review>

To anyone who is wondering about their "eyelash extensions" that they have for $25... Im here to tell you to save your money!!!!!! I went there expecting to get a full set of eyelash extensions. When I came in they got me seated quickly however things quickly got worse. The lady came over to me and to my surprise pulled out a box of individual Ardell fake eyelashes. The ones that they sell at CVS, Walgreens, Target  etc. If I wanted this i could have bought it for myself for less than $10. This is not real eyelash extensions and should not be advertised as being that when it is a 1-2 day lasting lash that anyone could easily do themselves. The way the fake eyelashes were placed on my eye was extremely uncomfortable and unsanitary as well considering the woman used tweezers directly on the waterline of my eye and was not wearing gloves as she touched all over my face and eyes. Lastly, it was very frustrating to go up to pay only to find out that they only accept credit cards if you spend over $60. They did have an ATM machine in the place but it was not working when I went to use it. Overall I had a horrible experience and I would not recommend anyone to go there at least for lashes.< /text>

Great car wash! The drive way and path is wide so I felt comfortable driving through. Most importantly this car wash does not have tracks that my tires have to lodge into.. it has a conveyor belt that I park onto and don’t have to worry about my tires or rims getting damaged since my car is lowered. Definitely the best part. Powerful vacuums to clean the inside as well. Overall great experience and will definitely come back</review>

Went here to wash my car tonight after shopping at Target. I was in a hurry and I wanted to give the place a shot. I saw that there was a line of cars and had seconds thoughts but ended up going. I was happy I did because the service was fast and I was out of there in no time. Place was clean and looked great. I did have the manager (black shirt) come over and ask how my wash was I thought that was pretty cool. Will definitely be back.</Text>

This brand new car wash opened up. I like the express type of car washes where I can vaccume on my own. My car came out super clean, fast, and all the equipment is brand new. Plus, it's a great value. Jose helped me out a bunch.</Review>

This car wash was good. The I had a quick question about the type of soap they used. The manager I believe was there to help me out, and he was really cool about answering it, afterwards when I detailing my car, he came up to check up if I was happy with the wash, and told me they were even going to do more upgrades to the place. I’ll be making this my car wash destination from now on.</Review>

Had really low expectations. Boy was I wrong! Never have I felt like my car wash experience really mattered. Im definitely coming back and my go to from now on. I was really surprised how clean, dry, shiney my car came out. Staff there were really helpful and generous. Jose, the Manager even came out of his way to ensure everything was okay. Good job you guys!</text>

Very happy with my experience at this drive thru car wash.  I am very skeptical on using drive thru car washes because I fear any damage to my car/paint, but I heard from friends this was a good one to go to.  I decided to give them a chance, and I am very happy I did!  The employees were there to guide me thru the process and my car came out squeaky clean :) thank you !< /Review>

For one when you pay for it it's a little expensive it's a dollar more than some and $2 more than others that I've been to the driveway to the car wash is very long and narrow and winding the car wash itself is very short compared to others I've been to so to me it's not really washing your car that great it's pretty much like driving it to a gas station car wash they don't have a air compressor blower to blow the water off your car in certain areas and their vacuum seems like there  falling apart for a new place it's not that great I definitely will skip this place from now on!!!</review>

My choice tacos are usually the Lengua and Cabeza, which this place does quite well. The meat is well cooked yet still has the right amount of fatty flavor dripping from it. The verde sauce is fantastic. They are nice and super quick on getting the tacos out. Always pleased with the service and food. The one thing they may lack is toppings and variety in sauces and the limes seem dry... Not a drop. But still a great place to get tacos.<//Text>

I am all about making our city better but if gentrification will cause this place to disappear we should all be very sad!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>It's pretty good for being a nice cheap taco/burrito/quesadilla place in the area. Especially for anybody looking for a lunch spot and have a full belly for $5. Enjoy the burrito de Al Pastor or Carne Asada.

They serve Huuuge burritos stuffed with rice, beans and the meat of your choice for only $5. I'd recommend trying out their Asada and Al Pastor.</Review>< Pics>

I dont always write reviews after I eat at places now.  Hollywood isn't really a place that's special for food.  I tried this place today and was very pleased.  I had a Cascadia and also a similar dish to nachos I cant remember the name.  The Cascadia was so filling I'm stuffed.  It was really good!! Id recommend this place almost over polo local!! Id come by here again!!<//Review>

<Review>I must say this are the BEST BURRITOS I have ever eaten here in California.
the tacos are bomb too. I never ever eat a whole burrito except when I come here, yummy. Just thinking about it makes me hungry and feel like driving all the way over there. :). Thank you Tino and your great cooker for the great food and service you are awesome!
i totally recommend this very clean and cute little place.  Ill be back for sure, I wish I live closer to La Taqueria I would be there very often (like 3 times a week :)) for sure!<//Review>< Pics>

<Name>Dunson Kamau< /Name><Text>5 Stars for superb service. Charming guy. Understands Los Angelino dining  culture. Carne Asada Burrito more on the Gringo side of the palate, but still hits the spot. YUM!! Napkins and sauces always bagged without requesting. Good Souls. Great value too!< /Text>< date>

This place is outstanding. I don't know how they do it, but whatever I order is tasty and consistent every time. Food is ready quick no matter how busy it is, and the guys working there are really friendly. Love it.< /Text>

Some of the best tacos in LA. I eat here 1-2 times a week and I never get tired of it. Cheap, delicious, and consistent. Couldn't ask anything more of a taco shop, and the service is top notch!<//text>

I was such a fan but lately they havent had sour cream and the food is hit or miss. The last time I bought an Asada quesadilla and chicken tacos everything was salty oily and yet dry. I was such a fan and now its meh. Hopefully next time will be better. When they're closing food is meh.< /review>

< Review>
We had to say goodbye to our 13yr old Alaskan Malamute, one of the hardest days ever. We were having a hard time finding a place that would allow us to be with him in the room. Even the vet we'd been going to since Rex was a puppy wouldn't allow it.. But the people at Ark Animal were amazing. They even sent a very touching sympathy card. We appreciate them so much!!< /Review>

<text>Dr. Costuma is a great man and a phenomenal vet. My wife and I had to put down our lab this week and they were able to show so much empathy. The doctor even wrote a hand written sympathy card. This is a great place with great people. I would never go to another vet. They truly care about you and your pets.</text>< pics>

<review>The only animal hospital I will take my dogs too! I started coming to Ark because I adopted a senior pitbull from the shelter and Dr Costuma was able to do a wonderful wellness check on him right out of the shelter. He was awesome from the start and now I take my other pitbulls here! The front girls, Cody and Jackie are awesome, always making sure my dogs are taking care of! I can’t thank them enough!!!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

<review>I brought my dog to Ark Animal Hospital after having a bad experience with another local Vets office. Huge difference. After our visit I feel that Dr. Costuma actually cares about my pet. He took the time to explain all of our options and recommended treatments. I am glad to have found this office.</review>< pics>

The technician who took my dog in for his shots was super nice & easy to talk to. It was a quick visit!👍 The receptionists inside were eh. They could be more friendly. I forgot that I was supposed to call 1st, before going into the building. I was wearing a mask, but when I went inside, there was a split second of "freeze" & I could have sworn I had just walked in with the bubonic plague. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the ones that people would call a sheep. And I don't care what they call me, because I am very confirmed about wearing a mask. I do so everywhere I go. That being said, I'll go back to what I already said: their receptionists could be a little more friendly.< /Text>

<Text>I brought my much-loved cat, Hemmingway to ARK, after his previous clinic, South Temecula Vetenatry Clinic, completely failed to resolve a persistent ear issue (after multiple visits and conversations).

Dr. Cosuma at ARK immediately referred me to a dermatologist for my ailing cat. Unfortunately, cancer cells from the tumor growing in his ear and cheek (which his previous Vet completely missed) had spread through his lymph nodes. Dr. Cosuma and his staff have continued to treat Hemmingway as possible, and I am so thankful for their patience and experience.

The team at ARK is caring and extremely knowledgeable. And when they can't assist, they refer to the very best specialists, providing support through the entire process.

Please don't trust your precious pets to any other Vet clinic.</Text><username>Shay Roehm< /username>< user_id>

I've tried many vetenarian locations but none compare to ARK Animal Hospital. My maltipoo has been having some issues with his health and was in search of a good location, Banfield Medical Hospital at Petsmart did nothing except charge me for everything with no results. But at ARK, the doctor there recommended a medication and followed through every couple days on a phone call to make sure my pet was showing results. Now he is healthy, went for a follow up in person and left with more good recommendations and they didn't even charge, they were happy that my pet was feeling better. Definitely staying here and Definitely recommending this location above all else. I thank them dearly!<//review>

I absolutely LOVE Dr. Costuma and all the wonderful women that are Ark Animal Hospital. They are always friendly and kind to me and my fur babies. You feel like part of a family when you are there.
One of my fur babies had lots of problems from having to have toe amputations to medications for an immune disorder and Dr. Costuma was quick to respond and always called to check on her wellbeing. During surgeries the staff called and communicated to me on how she was doing and after Dr. Costuma would talk with me to let me know how things went. They have always been receptive to questions and concerns I have had over the last 10 years my pups have gone to him.
If you want a forever Veterinarian, Ark Animal Hospital is the place to go!!<//Text>

I absolutely love this vet. He really takes time with your pet and explains everything in great detail. I never feel rushed and I feel like he truly cares about my pets wellbeing. The office staff are great too. They always call me a few days later to check on my pets and ask how they're doing. Wish I would have found this place sooner.<//review>

This is the place to take your fur babies. Very thorough and professional, yet not pushy to do the optional (elective treatments) like so many other Vets do. The Doctor truly understands your pet. We are now taking all of our pets there.</Text>

He asks a lot of questions to get a better understanding of what my concerns are is very thorough in explaining things to me. He has helped a lot in trying to get down to the bottom of what is really going on with Bella. We've made quite of bit of visits and tried different treatments. The Dr. is super fair with his charges. No complaints there. The staff are professional. But some of them can be a little friendlier. They are not rude. Just a little dry.  A smile can go a long way!

< Review>
Too expensive. I took my 2 kittens in for a first time visit and they gave them drops for the eyes because they were goopy. The drops worked for 1 of them but not all the way for the other. They had scheduled me for 3 weeks out so I called to tell them about her eyes. They said no worries when I come in on the next appt they would look at them. I just recieved a call to confirm my appt in 2 days and they said I would have to make a new appt 3 WEEKS longer to see the dr.because this was a visit for shots only. They never told me that and I paid $200 for their visit! I will never recommend this place. So disappointed.</Review>

<Text>Awesome , very caring great follow up.  Did a fantastic surgery on my maltese  hip surgery.  Fair pricing as well.  They are the best Vet I have ever had for my dogs. Always a great experience.  Big problem or routine visit.  They make you feel comfortable with a caring and friendly attitude.  This is from the top down. Go here with confidence for great care for your pets.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

So many vets try to sell you on a bunch of extra services and make you feel like a horrible pet owner if you don't buy; these guys don't do that at all.  They'll inform and suggest but let you know what's truly needed.  Would gladly recommend Ark Animal Hospital in Murrieta to anyone.< /Review></record>

Best vet and staff we have taken our pets to.  Got to spend an extra year with one of them after switching from another vet that seemed stuck in the practices of the past.  This vet seemed to know more of the latest developments in medicine, and had other avenues to explore. Staff is friendly.  Wish the office was a bit bigger, but that doesn't detract from the great work they do here.</Text>

<Text>Took our dog in with what we think was a rattlesnake bite.  Could not have had better service.  They understood that she had had been vaccinated for snake bites and they did not over or under react.  Nice when the vet gets on the floor with the dog and has great "bedside manner".  Dog is 99% better - and scheduled for rattlesnake avoidance training this month (a couple of weeks late, but still important for next time...)< /Text>< GmapID>

<text>I have to say my first visit with my dog was not what others have experienced . Welcoming? Not really. Not once was I introduced to or told what they would be doing for my dog . The receptionists talked with each other as I gave them the necessary paper work already printed and filled out from home. I sat with my dog just out of what I thought would be what they might want me to do but not sure.
Waited only 10 minutes or so and was approached by one staff member who only asked if my " is he friendly?" .  They led him to the back room to check his teeth and "trim his nails" as I had requested but seemed news to her so she fired back, "just so you know we will have to charge a tech fee if we cut his nails." He returned 5 minutes later with another staff member , who never introduced herself but just asked, "how long has he been chewing his feet?".  She did not listen to a word I had to say about his condition but rather just told me what she has told a thousand other people in her "diagnostics".
Very unprofessional, and very "un" welcoming environment. I can't imagine what their demeanor is with my dog in the back.</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Even thou it was sat. We were able to get in so our 2 year old westie could be examined. Possible balder infection. She was given a shot some anti bacterial pills. Although she was groggy the rest of the day, she seemed ok the next morning. We are completely satisfied with Ark animal hospital.< /text>

We recently changed to Ark and they are always so nice. We lost one of our boys this week and he is the first dog I've ever had so I was a mess. They helped me take care of the logistics when I was at a total loss. I owe them so much and we are still going to continue to bring our other dog here because we know he's in good hands with people who care about him.< /Text>

Dr. Costuma and his staff are really great people. a Few years ago I had gotten a puppy for my daughter and it suffered a broken leg from a fall. I brought the puppy in for examination on a Saturday night and Sunday Morning the puppy was in surgery and taken care of within 24 hours. The dog is now 3 years old and in perfect health. Dr. Costuma and his crew of caring staff are priceless.<//text>

< review>
My dog has chronic allergies. We must have spent a couple thousand dollars on him under the care of Banfield in Petsmart and no matter what they put him on, from $90 dog food to countless medications. Not to  mention the many hours sitting in the room waiting to be seen.

Then I brought him to Ark. We didn't have to wait long like we normally do at Banfield. Dr Costuma evaluated him then took the time to discuss his conditions and  treatment. We were sent home with some antibiotics and a couple other medications. What a night and day difference! We have our old dog back. He's no longer miserable and chewing himself raw.

He'll probably be on medication to keep him itch free for the rest of his life (he's almost 9), but it's a small (and affordable) price to pay for his comfort.< /review>

Unfortunately, they refused my Dad SSI case because according to the letter they sent " we  denied your case because you said you don't want to file ? ". Is this a joke ?. This is, literally the most insane response I have ever seen in my entire life. How come he doesn't want to file, and He waited so long for saying I dont want to file ?. That's really unprofessional. My Mom has been waiting for her status change for 3 months, and every time I call some say we can't find her form and other say you need to file again i cannot see it in the system ?.
Sadly, They are literally like a staff of a third world country with this negligence?. What is happening over there guys ?.</review>

I sent in my application for my name change and I received a letter stating to contact them if I didn’t receive my social security card. I even waited for 4 weeks. To my surprise they did nothing. Not even my application was pending. Instead of offering me a guarantee if I sent it in again, a rep just gave me excuses and not a single apology. I never write reviews but this really needed to get exposed. Horrible over the phone service.< /review>< pics>

I have been waiting for 3 months for my status change which is a process of 24 hrs. Also, when I call some agent say we found it and you need to wait another month and say we can't find your case you need to reapply ?</Text>

In around 340pm on a Wednesday and out by 4:17.

Directions: Take the 2nd elevator on the right when you enter the building (which, confusingly, has the name of the property company on it). Exit left from the elevator, walk through the doors straight ahead. Friendly, professional staff (both security and the person behind the counter).< /review>

This office it’s the worse in the entire Orange County and State . They don’t show respect towards the disabled plus they don’t double check their work so disabled people don’t get Robbed from their Monthly Income , they should be ashamed of themselves.</text>

As far as I know, they have two officers for phone service during COVID pandemic.

One of them is super friendly and super helpful. Another is literary the worst person on earth. He (the evil one) is not trying to fix any problem of yours and will make you feel like you are begging them for doing their job. He will not give you a second to talk.

I did not have a chance to get the evil officer's name. But for someone who had the same experience, I hope you don't get discouraged. Just keep trying to call them, until you get a chance to talk to the angel officer.< /text>

Ms.Torres  working at window #2 then we all moved over to window #1
has the worst Customer service, she is very rude, was not helpful at all, she had a terrible Attitude, very unprofessional,not willing to help.rushing to leave. Denied her supervisors or management saying no one was there and denied her name and who she reports to.

We arrived with her at window #2 at 11:35 am and the office closes at noon and she kept rushing us and keep saying that they will be closing and that she had already explained to my patient a  elderly 73 year old about her case , I am her caregiver and I asked if she can tell me what was the problem with her insurance being deactivated and she answered rudely saying that she will not repeat herself ,because she already told my patient, I feel like she doesn’t need to be rude .we have waited 2 plus hours to not know what is wrong with her insurance plan .I asked her for her supervisor or management and she said they were not there. she didn’t want to give me her first name only MS. Torres and her manager is Mr.Del ,

I told her that she needed to tell us what is the problem with her insurance and if she was not having a good day or didn’t like her job that I’m sorry but that was why she’s getting paid to assist and tell us what is the issue with her documents and explain to us, she didn’t tell me anything. She just told my patient that she needed a check for $259 , my patient was filling out check and I asked what the check was for she gave no information and my patient didn’t know either. I asked my patient what Ms. Torres told her was the issue with insurance and she said she didn’t know or remember......

I feel very upset , I felt discriminated and very disrespected,  how do they have this kind of person working to handle such important matters and doucunents and can’t explain the problem or be helpful. If she can’t do her job then she should not be working there. I bet many people would like to have her job position and they would be way better at it.
Did not resolve our  insurance problem and she didn’t care.</Review>

I applied for the social security with all requested evidence papers that was in July 2017 the lady asked me to wait for an email within 2 weeks as all my paper is OK. I’ve receive nothing so I went to the office but their was a employee their who asked me to leave as he cannot assist me cause his colleague has my documents and she is not there..every 3 days I pass to the office to find out what’s happening but every time the same window and same guy with same reply.. I ask to meet the manager and she promises that I’ll find my SSN in mail after 2 weeks but I didn’t get any thing until end of October 2017 I went to another country cause I wasn’t able to work or live in US without Social Security even if I’m an American living abroad. i have all evidence about what I’m talking about even the lady’s employee no. If needed .</review>

We were waiting for 2 hour (this is -🌟). First line start outside, so we were standing for about 20 minutes. After we can take our ticket with number and find a place to sit. We we were siting about 2 hours, but it wasn't long.
When I finally get called the guy on window was nice and friendly. He processed all my papers very fast, it took like 15 minutes.
Its good that in SSA they have restroom. Also they can call a translate service, so if you don't know English, or yours English is not very good you can speak with operator, that will translate to a person in the window.
My recommendation is to put a water tank or vending machine.<//text>

I simply want to change my address with SS but doing so seems to be a major time consuming effort.  At first I tried to Phone in but encountered several levels of "If you want _____press 1,2,3 etc"  I finally arrived at what I thought was the proper place but was informed the hold time would be about one hour.  No call back offered.  I finally visited the Santa Ana office   in person and found a room full of people waiting to be call in.  I asked the guard about how long the usual wait time was and he responded about one hour after registering.  I find this level of service by a major Federal Agency totally unacceptable when my only request is to inform them of a change of address..  I would rate the Santa Ana office at the lowest possible level in efficiency.        Hank Darlington</text>

<review>If there was a negative rating I would have rated it as a (-5).  It's hard for me to understand how a agency such as this can be so inept in executing their duties.  They have one of the worst phone systems I have ever dealt with, it's not designed to help resolve issues, but to the contrary, it is difficult to navigate and ambiguous. Once you do figure out how to get to a Representative to be able to talk to a human being that may or may not be able to help you, you get to wait for about 30 - 60 min to get someone on the line.  I was eventually told I have to go into the local office to take care of what I needed.  I went into the office at 1:30 and didn't get out until 4:30.  I received an online confirmation that I would receive my order by a certain date, (14 days to process), which never arrived.  So guess what I get to do?  Yep, you got it, I get to sit on the phone for another hour waiting for someone who might or might not be able to help me.  During my wait on the phone I get to listen to the reminder that I can go on to their useless website and help myself, except I can't.  This is a prime example of taxpayer money being wasted. Something that should be able to be resolved over the internet and have processed in a couple of days, takes over a month to resolve. If any business functioned like this, they would be out of business because no one would put up with it. Employees are unaccountable, indifferent, and unfriendly. Going on 5 hours of my time to get a document processed that I need for my unemployment benefits. Ridiculous!!!<//review></record>

The wait to get called is not tooo long. However I have been trying since last year November 2016 to clear a fraud alert on my ssn. With this fraud alert company are not able to approve my applications. I went on their website SSA.Gov to get more information and even there it said to visit my nearest office. I'd visit the office in Santa Ana. When my number was called Ms. Ortega helped me she ask me to prove my identify with a state licence and my ssn card, both were provided to her and said it will take couple of days to clear the fraud alert. Days turned to weeks and I called and left  her several messages on her direct extension. Heard nothing from her. I then called the main line and asked to speak to her supervisor Mr. Sanchez. No difference,  he also did not returned my calls. I was extremely upset and demand a call at this point. It passed two months. Ms. Ortega called and said she never got any of my voicemails. ...yeah right.. she said it has not been clear because they need to see my original birth certificate. Really! Then why did anyone called to ask me for that. I made another trip to Santa Ana office. Wasting another day of work. Once I got there I was told she was not there today and to leave it to who was ever next to call me. My number got called and a lady helped me she herself did not see any notes requesting that. I had to explain everything. ...unbelievable!
She made a copy and gave me my original birth certificate. She said ok your done. I told her that's it she looked at me and said yes. I told her that I need to know what is going to happened and she said I don't know. Wow!!! I told her I need to speak to someone who does know. Then Ms. Ortega came out and said that a guy from her office goes to an office located in  L.A. every Thursdays to prove and identify birth certificates and that she would call me. Couple days passed and she called to  informed me that they only need another prove of identify like a passport or school id. I don't have any of that and then asked me to bring an affidavit or letter from a recent doctor visit showing my full name, dob and address. I went again to the office for the third time. I saw her at the window in her office and dropped the letter and she told that with letter  they will be able to clear and remove the fraud alert. It's been two months after that and her or anyone at the office has not called and still the fraud is not clear. I called many times and no response. I cannot believe that it has been a total of eight months and yet nothing is resolve. It's just disappointing to have our important documents like the ssn handled poorly by careless and unprofessional staff. Also, they do not give your name upon answering the phone.  I do understand government places are always busy but not to get a response to just remove a fraud alert having all the necessary documents is RIDICULOUS! 8 months and still pending!!< /review>

Was there on a Wednesday which they close at 12pm. Office was easy to find parking was a hassle tho. Parking is $4.00 for an hour then $1 every 15mins after. Try scheduling an appt.</Review>

Phone service is a mess. Spend hours on hold, then get an email that says call if you have a problem. No action taken to resolve issue.<//Text>

I would have given the 5 stars but the parking is horrible I you have to pay for parking I don't understand if they want you to go in they should at least validate parking but they don't and if you try to park in other business they have people watching at all times as soon as you park they are already coming to tell you something I would recommend going to the brea office hardly any wait and you don't have to pay for parking</Review>

<review>Went in to get a haircut. I have a man bun and I wanted lower part to be cut to a zero. When I got home I realized that a lot of my bum hair was cut too and by the ears I have hair sticking. I don’t remember barbers name but I believe it was Martin so good luck. But shop looks real clean and friendly.

They have always been very accommodating.  Just a week ago I made an appointment with one of the barbers, and he had to leave early for family reasons, but one of the owners asked me to hang tight and after a short while he was able to get me cut and looking clean.< /text>

Martin gave me a great cut, and did an even better job trimming my beard. The atmosphere is very welcoming and friendly. They also do a great job of maintaining COVID safety without compromising the quality of their work.

Be aware - they do have an ATM inside because this is a cash only business.<//Review>

<Review>I've gotten my hair cut with Brandon for a few years now and every single time it's A+ service. I love the service so much that I've taken my son to him. My son has special needs and Brandon is so accommodating to him. My wife and I love watching the relationship grow between Brandon and my son. I'm glad to call Brandon my friend! Highly recommended, family friendly but also a good place to hang out with the guys!< /Review><time>1582256513051<//time>< Pics>

I told him I had an appointment at 4 pm and he said "he know, but it will just be a quick cleanup" for the person he was letting in his chair and asked if it was ok with me. I told him I had somewhere to be and it wasn't ok with me. He aggressively said then you can go, and maybe come back next weekend. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! Keep in mind I'm a first time customer new to the area and this is no way to treat a first time customer if you want to grow your business. I will never be coming back.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>This is one of the best barbers in the greater Sacramento area. As someone who has moved a lot I get to learn the food scene, but a good barber is a bigger challenge. These guys don’t disappoint. Walk ins/ Appointments and cash/Venmo accepted. Dominic kills it every time!< /Review><gmap_id>0x809b219adf8c0291:0xf4c9b86585fe31f3< /gmap_id>< time>

Been going to Brandon for about 3-4 years now. Always a great cut for a very reasonable price. Today my coworkers complimented me on my cut and the fact that I was only out of the office for about 35 minutes, including drive time. This dude knows his stuff.<//review>

The Rose Barbershop in Roseville off Foothills Blvd next Porter's House of Draft is a new player in town in the trendy space of men's barbershops.  Brandon and his partner already have a solid clientele base and will expand from 2 chairs to 6 chairs as soon as qualified barbers are hired and trained.  The Shop is clean and ready for new clients. Note: Appointments are the way to go, but walks-in may be welcome once the other chairs have barbers.</review>

<Review>I have been going to Brandon for a couple years now. He did such a great job cutting my son's hair, I dropped my regular barber. He always takes his time and treats my 8yo son like a friend. My son enjoys going to get his hair cut, because he gets to chat with Brandon....My wife claims my hair has never looked better.< /Review>< date>

Cute place to splash in the water, but quite a few "unique" characters hanging around, heavy smell of marijuana. Don't think we'll stop by again.</review>

<UserId.>102567580356378825882</UserId.><username>Tom Love< /username><resp>None</resp><review>Disappointed by the element and smell of skunk weed for a family outing. Very eclectic crowd ...as we entered looked like people from the movie Deliverance with all tables filled and everyone staring at my family. Down the stairs was a bit better some young girls a few families scattered about. Water close to shore was black from decaying leaves and there were a lot of rocks many sharp which made it hard to walk in the water. The water was freezing and murky not what I'd hoped. We left after 20 minutes as this just wasn't out seen and the smell of 420 was so heavy which was surprising with so many young kids wandering.<//review>< rating>

Tucked away park in a neighborhood of Boulder Creek with a swimming hole with rope swing. There's a grassy area in front of a covered pavement  area where bands were playing when I visited for a local radio show fundraiser and performance day.  Small section of tables is off to a side. There is a water shower feature to rinse off if you want for after a swim in the creek. Beautiful, tall redwood and assorted oak trees surround the park.<//Text>

It is a nice park that has access to a large, slow-moving river. If you want your own space to place your things, you may want to arrive earlier in the day (parking is cramped, too).<//Review>

<Review>Love this place I've lived around the corner for quite some time and never tried them out but I am absolutely in love with everything about this place. Location is secret, never too busy, customer service is alright and you definitely get exactly what you pay for. The quality is excellent Everytime I usually get the acrylic manicure with gel finish and a manicure. Ask for TEE!< /Review>< Name>

I dont care how far I live from the shop, I will always drive the miles to come here. Just recently took a group of 5 teenagers to get their nails done. Mothers were very pleased with their nails!</review>

<Review>It's simple make an appointment if you do not want to wait. Kim is great, Linda is great. All of the nail techs are good at what they do. As for nail design choices, you won't have a problem finding what you want!! Infact, you might be overwhelmed by your choices. Pedicures are pure luxury here too.<//Review>< pics>

Going to a pizza place for breakfast may sound contradictory, but it was great. Toast with soft cooked eggs, potato breakfast bowl, and everything breakfast bowl. Personally I had the everything breakfast bowl, and when I ate it I said "this is delicious, and I won't feel horrible later". (Referring to the feeling after eating a pile of pancakes, sugary french toast, or a load of hollandaise sauce). Ingredients seemed very fresh. Seasoned well, but not too heavy. Would recommend. My only recommendation (and mild disappointment) was that I think they should have a breakfast pizza (sausage/bacon, potatoes, soft cooked egg, avocado). Basically take the everything bowl and put it on a pizza crust instead of with a side of toast 😋.< /text>< gmap_id>

Pizza isn't bad but the service could be a bit better. The guy serving me was pretty rude. Didn't say hello, welcome and was mumbling and overall had a bad attitude. It doesn't look like they close for a few more hours either.<//Review>

The Tuscan pizza is filled with rich and creamy goodness! The mushroom truffles with onions were so tasteful, I had to eat about four slices! The service here is also great, they really care about their customers! I love ZPizza and I’ll be back soon for more! 10/10<//text>

<text>Best vegan pizza in town. The store is right across the street from the Montage and Teasure Island park, the ideal location to eat pizza and watch the amazing sunsets. Wine and beer are also sold. Ample salads are also available along with some other warm dishes (eggplant parmigiana, spaghetti, erc.). Breakfast options are also available.<//text>< Rating>

4.5 STARS
This is the best pizza I've had in awhile. The crust/pizza ratio was perfect...New York style if you will. The only thing I'd add is more flavoring (garlic etc) to the sauce on the pizza. Otherwise I'd order from here again if I'm in town again!!!
Try it out!< /Text>

They sell pizza by the slice. Kind of. They had a few random slices to choose from. Then one of us ordered a slice of sausage pizza and they ended up giving her a slice of cheese and said we are out of sausage...  I ordered a slice of sausage for the road knowing that they would need to make the pizza and I was okay waiting the 10 minutes... Then they gave me sausage / mushroom pizza. Again not what was ordered! I am not allergic to mushrooms I just don't like them on my pizza. The point is it does not matter what you order they are going to give you whatever they feel like giving you.<//text>

I used to consider Zpizza a good spot to get a decent slice of New York style pizza so When I went in to get a couple of pepperoni slices and was surprised to see they had a very limited selection. The choices where Cheese, sausage and mushroom, tomato and basil. I asked if they had anything else coming up they said “no”. I write “no” in quotations because that was the flat answer to my question. Keep in mind this was on a Sunday late afternoon in July so they where not exactly about to close. That lack of effort should have steered my decision making... to leave.
The slices I chose where under-heated and immediately reminded me of grade school cafeteria “pizza”. If your grade school cafeteria “pizza” was anything like my grade cafeteria “pizza” then you know the quotes for “pizza” in this case is for the sake sake of Irony rather than exactitude.</Review><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

We went to Zpizza for the first time and we really enjoyed the food and I felt very welcome because as soon as I walked in someone said hello to me.
I like to build my own pizza because of so many allergies I have and they were so helpful and patient with me and helped me build an awesome pizza. The staff was very friendly and we got our food really fast and it was great. I actually can't wait to go back and try more of the menu they offer.<//Review>

Fresh organic ingredients and a nice flat crust pizza. Staff was very pleasant and the cost was reasonable.</review>

I wanted something in the area that was quick, not too busy, and affordable. I also wanted a place to work where i wont be bothered by the noise or the crowd. This was a great choice when I came across this plaza. I didnt want to spend too much, but still get fed enough that i wouldnt get hungry again during my way home.

Their gender neutral restrooms are located at the back of the establishment just past the condiments. There is plenty of parking, and lots of space to sit and dine. I sat by the windows at the high chairs and tables.

What really got me to like this place was their lunch special is actually ongoing - although it says lunch, it goes on all day - so you get a pretty good deal on a slice of pizza, a half sandwich and a salad or any 2 or 3 combinations of the latter. Then you can add a fountain drink for a buck more.< /Text>

Just picked up dinner tonight while staying at the montage for the weekend. Ordered the penne pasta, pasta was overcooked and there was not enough sauce so it wasn't flavorful..the pizza was a little stiff and when I took a bite all the cheese came in one piece it was funny because it was in a shape of a triangle..my husband ordered wings as well, he said they were ok..disappointed since the reviews were good< /Text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>We’ve eaten from here quite a few times during the pandemic era.  The food’s always ready when they say it will be and they’ve never messed up an order.  It’s tasty and interesting and they have pretty good cocktails - you pays, but you gets.  Today, though, perhaps the bar wasn’t being run by the A team in the middle of the afternoon.  Should I have to wait half an hour for them to sort out what should have been ready when I arrived?  They were apologetic but there was never an order to comp me anything.  The food is a little salty for my taste.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>Got food poisoning from their Claypot Salmon that landed me in the ER on 4/11/21. Will post a longer review with more details when I've figured out how to fit everything in the character limit.<//Review><rating>1<//rating>< time>

< Review>
Great for a group dinner, people watching, and eating excellent Asian fusion food. Gives you all the reason to step out and grab a bite. The entrees are good, and so are the cocktails. While the starters are good - I highly recommend the Satays and fried cauliflower - a few more options would be great. Wok prawns spicy finished the meal well. Did not try the deserts though this time.</Review>

<gmap_id>0x808fcae00584be5f:0x1f519e646edac40c</gmap_id><Text>My fiancé and I were planning on having a nice night out. We've been going through a lot and really needed it. I talked about Straits and told him how amazing it was and really talked it up. We got to the outside lounge and the host said we could stay for about an hour before bottle service. We got to our seats and she served us water. Then we sat there for 30min watching everyone come in AFTER US get served drinks and food. NO ONE came to take our order, or check on us. I even made eye contact with two waiters and still no one came. We left and mentioned it to the host who also saw that we were not served and did nothing about it. Listen. We are all grown. If you don’t want to seat us because you are moving into bottle service time, or short staff, then just tell us you are full and cant seat us.<//Text>< response>

<review>Covid nightmare. Overcrowded, staff polishing cutlery with masks under their chins. Piles of dirty hand towels in the bathroom. Spoke to manager, who didn't really care. Guests allowed to walk around with no masks.. no hand sanitizer.

Fairly priced, good vibes but lacks that differentiator and there is nothing that will stop you from leaving once you in. I enjoy this place tho, it’s an option< /Text>

<Text>Great food, fast service, and safe COVID precautions. I really liked the Ginger Singaporean Soda and the garlic noodles. Most of the dishes that we ordered were kid friendly and the service was quick. Everyone was wearing masks, social distancing and the food came very quickly. Overall, we had as great of an experience as before the pandemic.<//Text>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>An "oldie but a goodie" on Santana Row. In the before times it was a great venue for birthday parties and private events, now it's a great spot for outdoor dining. The patio on the side has heat lamps overhead to keep diners comfortable. The tables on the street has freestanding heat lamps.
Service can be a bit slow to start but once food is ordered it shows up quickly, fresh, and hot.
Sushi sampler was the one disappointing dish - nothing bad, but nothing special.
Shaking Beef was better than I remembered with perfect medium rare steak. Lobster tail garlic noodles was delightful.
Drinks are beautifully made. Highly recommended for a nice dinner out.< /Text>< Pictures>

The atmosphere is nice and the food is decent. The food we ordered was sesame glazed chicken, which was very tasty, definitely recommend that. The place follows Covid protocols but few of the seats are placed right on the sidewalk, which seems a bit too close to people literally walking by you.< /Text>

Food and wait staff is great however they do not serve food for people at the table at the same time. I was half finished before my dinner partner got her meal.  Ruined the dining experience< /Text>

<text>Straits is back in full bloom with pre-covid like crowd. Lots of outdoor seating. Good service and you get your food fast.

Getting back here after a long covid lockdown. Feel somehow the taste and flavors have changed. Possibly new chef and cooking team. Roti prata is good as always. Crispy cauliflower was too bland and not cooked well. Nasi goreng (fried rice) ordered with both brown and white rice was lacking the flavor or taste that I’ve experienced here before. Tried ‘Sentosa’ cocktail thinking that may be their specialty since it’s Singaporean but it wasn’t any good.

Overall, good place to hangout but expectations for food should be lowered.< /text>< pictures>

The waiters were nice. But the concierge did not do proper job of explaining how to order, and complained me later about making a pick up order in a rather condescending manner (and I am their patron!, Jesus). Food is just fine.< /Text>

I ordered hainan chicken rice, which I frequently ate in Singapore and the chicken wasn’t flavorful, the ginger side dish was so salty and the soup that comes with it tasted so different. It’s overpriced. They should hire Singaporean cooks or have their cooks try the food in Singapore, if they plan on imitating and serving Singaporean.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Their food is fantastic.... definitely one dish can be shared by 2 easily; presentation is fabulous, waiters are nice and very well maintained, their cocktails are little over priced, specially wines, but it’s a perfect place for any type of hang out... ( date, family dinner, girls out or so), will definitely go there again.<//text>

I liked the limiting of customers in the store, with proper social distancing of people lined up to enter, as well as employees wearing masks and proper gloves behind the counter. Walk in service, with only outdoor seating on sidewalk. Tables 6 feet apart. Beautiful summer morning for a cheese and bacon quiche. They also have a vegetarian quiche.  Pastries galore with specialty coffee to order. Wonderful.  A big YES!< /text>

Love this place. The food is really good and the drinks are awesome. Our waiter, Adrian, was amazing and super fast and helpful.  The garlic noodles with chicken were my favorite. Usually,  I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts but the way they prepared it, it's just perfect. It was sweet and tangy and soft. The calamari was also really soft and so yum with their white sauce.</Review>

Impressed with the taste of the food and also price. I thought food will be very pricey, because of location, but I was wrong. We liked the Roti parata and Garlic Noodles. Vegetable curry was pretty good too. I am not a great fan of brown rice, but brown fried rice was very tasty as well. Good place to visit if you are visiting Santana row!<//Review>

Great place to have dinner while you walk around Santana Row......not inexpensive but for the location , I would say it is reasonable. Just like the name describes, food is Asian fusion with s blend of southern Malaysian, Singaporean & some extents Indonesian. We ordered 3 appetizers followed by the main course entrees and we loved all of them. Excellent service and very nice behavior< /review>

<review>I had a very bad experience. Waited for my food for almost 45 minutes. Looks like they forgot my order. I changed my table due to the chaotic location, none of the servers helped me, I had to carry my own plates and glasses.
Lacks a lot in mannerisms and serving etiquettes.</review></record></dataset><record>

Had a wonderful late lunch with my aunt there today. I have been here once before and both times was happy with my choices. This is the shrimp and Fuji apple salad, the salad was crunchy and the dressing wasn’t too heavy handed. My aunt got the poke bowl and while it was simple it looked tasty. Service was prompt and food was too. Will be back for sure!< /text>

I don't know why this place has below 4 stars. I went there with friends and absolutely loved the food we ordered. The chicken satay , garlic noodles and traditional chicken with broth were mind blowing! The ambience was quiet and nice. Good for office lunches. Would definitely love to go again.< /Review>

< Review>
The food was good and the ambiance is great. Service was friendly and they are following covet protocols well. The only thing is we didn't get our appetizer until our third person got their food and one of our drinks didn't come until after we had asked for the check. The portions are small but the food is really good. I recommend the vegetarian roti as an appetizer.<//Review>

< Review>
Came here for drinks. It was the middle of the afternoon so there was barely anyone at the bar and yet we had to wait for a long time to get served. They put straws in their drinks (even glasses of water) which is an automatic loss of a star for me. Be environmentally conscious, it's not too much to ask. Overall experience was average, can't comment on the food because didn't eat here. Please stop with the straws!<//Review>

Great food, great location, great everything except we ordered two entrees and one came out like right away- super fast! (Coconut shrimp fried rice) and then we like ate it and then our second entree came out - we told our server we wanted to share both entrees but nonetheless the food was really yummooo!!<//text>

<text>Pros:
- Food was great, decent portions for the price
- ambiance is awesome, feels like sitting right on Santana Row.

Cons:
- terribly understaffed
- orders weren't just right. We asked for no straws in our drinks, and we got straws. We asked for extra spicy entrees and they were mild.

We went on July 3, and they had two main hostesses that were taking orders on our half of the restaurant. It took forever for us to get our checks and that really soured our mood, but those hostesses were doing all they could. The orders being off is probably a result of how understaffed they were.

The dishes were great though, and the drinks were interesting. Also, 6 people ate, along with drinks for $200 before tip (we shared dishes), which I think is a good price, especially considering it's on Santana Row.</text>< Pictures>

I can’t say I was disappointed but I wasn’t wowed too. Maybe my expectation was too high. I asked our server if the Laksa would be a proper Laksa and he guaranteed me it would be...he was wrong. But then I thought maybe he hadn’t had a Laksa in Singapore. Maybe my my past experiences were lost when I left Asian years ago. We ordered a few dishes and the food was great (just not what you would have in Asian). The drinks were a little pricey but then you are on Santana Row. I suggest you eat here as you it will give you glimpses of Asian cuisine but if you want the real thing, you will have to go to Asian (or my country...Australia)!!

<review>Service was ok. Not good not great nor terrible. Just ok. Food... Well 1 out of 4 dishes was mediocre. Ordered the BBQ chicken and well the chicken was flavorless and barely warm. The soup that comes with the chicken had good flavor but was cold. The rice and salad stole the show, simply amazing.<//review>< gmapID>

<review>Sat down at a sidewalk table as indicated by hostess. Water arrived quickly. No sign of a server for ~10 minutes. Asked bus boy to tell server we are ready to order. Took almost 5 more minutes. We understand it's Covid but we've tried to support restaurants either via takeout or recently outdoor dining, and this has been the worse. The person who took out order may have just been jumping into the breach... Hopefully the food will be close to how it was pre-Covid. Will edit... So far, not impressed.

Update: food was good. Not as hot as could be; several of the dishes that we ordered should have been premade (ribs appetizer, beef rengdang, garlic noodles) and they came out quickly. I'd say the taste was 80% of pre-Covid quality, which is not bad considering... Many other places are 60%.  Raising review from 2 to 3 stars.  Oh, an important datum: we had arrived before 5pm for reasons, so they weren't that busy. It could have been between shifts, I guess.<//review><gmap_id>0x808fcae00584be5f:0x1f519e646edac40c</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Poor service. Food was served late and cold. For the  price range we expect a much better service. Would not recommend this place.
Also spicy here is very sweet, beware.<//text>

My first visit to this restaurant food was excellent. We orders several items and everything was excellent. Samosa’s to Risotto to basil chicken, crab cakes popcorn chicken, vegetable fried rice and more for a party of 9.  Good seating. Great ambiance. Not very pricey. In fact very good value for money. Easy parking as well.<//Text>

<text>Service is good. The waiter is polite and attentive to us. Atmosphere is terrible. Covid seems really made straits a sad place. Everything rans down. The Food Quality is terribe. We order the sea food platter and other three dishes.

Sea food platter is really not fresh. There are yellow ring stain on the inner shell on all the shells. There was a dried fly stuck on the shell. When I showed the hostess, she told me it is a black spot. Salmon is too hard to chew. We left majority of the food untouched. Now I just hope that we do not get food poisoning.

Spicy street noodle is not spicy and chicken is hard in the pai Thai. What is really going on at straits. We used to life it a lot the quality is really going down.< /text>< pictures>

Great food. This place has nailed how to cook vegetables. The curry cauliflower appetizer was great! The salad was awesome. I'm a meat eater but I seem to like my vegetables at this place better than the meat dishes.  My wife's grilled chicken was dry but she said it tasted ok. That's the only reason for the missing star. I would give it 4 1/2 stars.< /text>

I wish I could do 0 stars. First and definite last time visiting this “restaurant”. Yeah, service was quick but the portions were TINY. Even the entrees. We ordered buttered prawns. Not a mountain of bread crumb covering 5 pieces of  baby shrimp. The lamb was SOAKED in grease. Ordered Sea-bass as an entree, and got barely a espresso sized portion of fish with a couple pieces of mushroom and bell pepper. Overpriced for mediocre food. Ordered 2 drinks, a way overpriced appetizers at 18 bucks a pop, and 2 entrees and paid over $130. Please do yourself a favor and ignore the appealing physical appearance of this place and it’s laid back aesthetic and save yourself the torture. if you’re looking for a romantic night out, this is not the place you’re looking for, let alone ever.</Text>

<Text>The atmosphere here is nice, quiet and modern. We got seated fast which was nice for a Saturday. Most of the food we ordered was tasty, some not as much .. the chicken satay and phad Thai was good but nothing great, the portion size was no bueno to say the least. Usually when you go to restaurants that serve family style the portions are alot bigger and would better reflect why your paying so much... but I guess that just comes with Santana Row.. The bar and lounge area looked nice to do drinks and appetizers but I don't think I'll be back here for lunch or dinner....</Text>< pics>

The brunch was some of the best I've ever had. The Chicken Tikka Masala Chilaquiles and the soft shell crab and grits were different that anything I've had, and both dishes were phenomenal. They also had $15 mimosas and bloody mary's. Only basing this rating off their brunch as it's been too long since I've had anything else there.<//Review>

Great location right along Santana Row

If you arrive just before dinner time, you can easily get seated. The hostesses were very accommodating with my need to work and eat and plug in my laptop. They seated me in an area where I could do my phone calls and work while I ate. The menu is different if you are seated at the lounge vs the dining area and drinks are different prices too.

Menu selection is great in both the dining area and lounge. Lots of exotic dishes that is a fusion of American and Asian cuisine. Prices aren’t too bad with a lot of entrée dishes under $30. Beverage selection is pretty good and prices are average. The portions are a little on the small side but very tasty. Service was good from the time you are seated to the time you finish off. They didn’t have any issues with me moving about the restaurant and changing tables.

It gets a little loud as the night progresses because of the music and a different crowd encroaches. It seems like a usual hangout for business visitors though.

I ordered the Pan Seared Salmon for $20. It was really unique with all my favourite flavours mixed in from cilantro to lemongrass chili sambal and mango salsa sauce. Salmon was done perfectly. I would go back again but the only unfortunate thing about Santana Row is that most of the restaurants are closed by around 11pm.</Text>

But food the department went down so much since my last visit. All the food we ordered came in less than 5 minutes since we placed the order. I was bit surprised at the speed of preparing the meals. It felt kitchen warming up the cold food to achieve this speed. There was no flavor, or too spicy. Specially, Indian chicken dish was from packed Costco meals.

We were so disappointed and doubt will be coming back anytime soon.< /Review>< pictures>

Came here on a Saturday night.  Its an interesting concept (restaurant turn "club"/lounge).  Personally, the music didn't work for me... its not quite there to be club level, but its not quite chill enough to be a lounge either.  Plus the selection is predominately hip-hop through time.  Perhaps catering to local tastes?  The four star is entirely for the food, because its amazing.  Highly recommend the Nasi Goreng (Indonesian fried rice) and the Brussels sprouts</Text>

<Review>6 of us ordered round of drinks around 11:30pm Saturday night.. 15 min later they announced that they have a last call.. we still had our drinks and waitress offered to get another round since they would not serve anymore.. we agreed and as soon as we got our 2 round of drinks they literally kicked us out with drinks untouched!

<review>Let me put it this way...You are a group of friends hanging out in Santana Row and you walk past Straits. From the outside it looked like a decent place. So you decided to sit in the lounge and have a good time. You waited for sometime and expected someone to come and serve you, clean your table or take your order for drinks and food. You waited and waited for several minutes and loose your patience.  No eminent sign of customer service. Thats exactly whats going to happen if you go here! So don’t ruin your beautiful evening and save your patience. This place is the WORST customer service. Food is nice don’t take me wrong. But to get to the point where you can enjoy your drinks and food, you have had already wasted a lot of time and probably gotten a bit frustrated. Hope this helps.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Extra star for being clean and having good service. The food is not good, honestly. There is a strange mixture of cultural cuisines with no obvious cohesion. Chicken was undercooked, sauces were all very vinegary. Would not recommend going here unless you want to spend a lot for a little< /text>

< review>
Have heard great things about this restaurant and wanted to try since we only visit San Jose to see my grandparents.  Due to the convenience of charging our Tesla at supercharger we decided to give it a try.  We were in love with the ambient, the music and trendy lounge/restaurant setting.  Service was warm and attentive.  Loved our dirty martini and hot tea for my beloved Wife.  Fish is our favorite so we ordered what was listed first in the seafood section, tuna tartare, sashimi (missing the hamachi but didn’t even get a notice, just come out as if I didn’t remember what I ordered) so just tiny slices of low grade ahi and salmon.  And we also ordered the muscles which the sauce was great but the mussels were over cooked and a bit on the rotten side...should have sent those back but what the heck, it was our first time and I really like the staffs and bar tender who mixed a bomb kettle one dirty martini.  The food was disappointing, except for the tuna tartare.  I gave an average tip because the dish sent out anyway knowing that there was no hamachi, could’ve consulted and letting me know I would appreciate that.  Anyway, I would come back for the drinks and atmosphere  but I will not try the sashimi or mussels ever!!! 😕😔<//review>

The chicken sandwich was capably prepared: crispy, fried chicken and nicely toasted bun. We also tried a curry and it was decent.

The music inside the restaurant is loud and repetitive. We sat outside and had a decent time. I don't think I would like sitting inside because of the music.< /Text>

Was there for lunch. Had one of the worst customer service experiences ever. Servers literally throw dishes on the table. It was not busy at all. Got their special poke dish which resembled more of a sushi roll than a poke. When I asked repeatedly for soy sauce, which was not available at my table, I got salt instead. There were only chopsticks, had to ask for a fork, which the server forgot to bring the first time around. No water refills either. I am usually a happy customer and was in a good mood when I got there. I do not think the problem was in me. The servers looked relatively young, inexperienced and lacking motivation. Most of the time salary is the culprit of the subpar customer service. The management should definitely address the cause.< /Text>

Atmosphere and food menu option is great. If you are looking for Asian inspired cuisine worth trying. Moscow mules tasted great. Service mixed up a lot of orders at our table. Pad Thai 2 Stars, it tasted very dry would have been better with more sauce.<//text>

Third bad experience in a row. This forced me to leave a feedback. Food quality is average at best and the service at Straits is consistently BAD. I’ve experienced everything from no one showing up to take your drinks order for 40 minutes to missed items from order, incorrect billing etc etc.
There are much better restaurants in this area. Save your money and go someplace else to enjoy a good lunch or an enjoyable evening.<//Text>

WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
Absolutely horrible experience. Glo and I went for lunch to celebrate our tenth anniversary.
Stay-cation kinda thing. So we try Straits for the first time.
This was an absolute disaster.
The hostess seats and says your server is -------.  About 20 minutes and 1&1/2 glasses of water later just as we start to question eating there another server introduces herself and asked if the original server had been by. We say no so she said she is assisting him and will help us.
I asked for Calamari with corn starch instead of flour. We also place our entree order being we've been waiting so long we know the menu.
The server returns and says the CHEF? said "he can't prep it that way". A so called CHEF and he can't do this. Maybe it was beyond his skill level. Not IMPOSSIBLE if he's a "CHEF".
So, no appetizer.
So the server brings me a GF menu and asks if I want to change my dish. I say sure. I'd like the salmon. She returns with that look like, "this ain't going well" and says the chef is only prepping salmon for dinner and not for lunch. Someone please explain that to me!
Sure. I'll stay with the original order.
We order the Banana Salad and a Yellow Curry. About 30 seconds later a third server brings us a salad and a green curry. We look at each other and tell him this can't be ours. I honestly said. Is this a fast food restaurant.
He gives my wife the salad and then tries to give me the curry and said this really can't be ours. It's not right. He picks up the curry and tries 2 other tables before he realizes it belong to the table next to us. The salad belonged to them also. So now they have to fix that table also.
Five ladies at a four top having a good time so they probably didn't mind YELP it.
I end up waiting about 20 minutes again and ask 2 servers for assistance. Looking for the order taking server. No luck. Ask 3 people to refill the Endless mimosa which is becoming a pain to get refilled.
I actually walked over to the bar and asked the bartender to send some mimosa over. Finally a manager named S-------io comes over with a lost look and asks if I need some help. I explain to him how mind boggling things are going so he offers to assist. I watch him go to the POS and review our order. He talks to both servers and the "CHEF". A moment later I see the chef bring him a bowl and........
The manager drops it.  Really. No kidding. He dropped the bowl.
Poor kid, he takes off and walks to the back of the kitchen. That's why I call him a kid. I guess maybe he's embarrassed. I keep watching because I'm laughing at this point thinking, can it get worse.
A few minutes later he brings me a bowl.  He tells me please be careful because it's HOT. Guess what. Hot?  Who are you kidding.
Still trying to get mimosa. I should have brought a flask. I literally asked nine times for 2 refills.
He never came back. Not MANager enough I guess. We eat.
I smile at my wife and tell her happy anniversary and apologize for picking this JOKE of endless JOKES as our special outing.
She smiles back and tells me.
I BET THE ONLY THING WE GET IN A REASONABLE TIME IS THE CHECK.
Guess what came about a second later. Maybe she saw them coming from behind me.
The manAGER comp'ed my curry only.  This place is truly head scratching as a successful restaurant.  I should have look for a camera crew to walk in any moment and ask "What would you do"?<//text>

Service could have been better. Forgot order ... we were chatting so did nt bother us much... but this review is 1 star because the staff raised an eyebrow when we needed more time to finish our dishes...</text>< gmapID>

The price definitely reflects a family style portion but that's not what you get, although it is  delicious. At night the lounge is a great place for drinks and hanging out.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>This place is always packed on the weekends, so I went in mid-week for a late lunch, and the place wasn't very crowded.  Had the papaya leaf salmon with green mango salad.  It came with a medium spicy peanut sauce.  Pretty tasty, but ask your waiter for a small side of rice to complete the meal.  The salad was a little sweet, but was a good counterpoint to the spiciness of the peanut sauce.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Food was okay, nothing special. I’m mostly leaving 2 stars because of the service. My fiancé and I were blatantly treated like we weren’t going to buy a lot while the people next to us who were dressed in a suit and a name brand dress were treated far better. We both had the same server, but he spent like 2 minutes with us max and assumed we wanted waters didn’t ask if we wanted anything to drink. Another waiter had to get us water when he noticed our drinks were empty, 20 minutes after we asked our waiter for water. Our waiter spent a good 15 minutes asking about if the people next to ya wanted drinks and trying to give them suggestions. We were treated like we weren’t worth the time because we were both in our work clothes. And in the end when I told my fiancé I didn’t want desert because I didn’t want to stay there any longer the guy suggested desert places on Santana Row to us like we’d never been there suggesting cheaper desert places.

And to top it off Straits charges a fare fee which is basically their way of getting customers to pay for their servers minimum wage.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great South-East Asian fusion fare. Good service and a good place to be. Gets quite loud during the evening or at night. But you can always go for a quieter brunch or lunch. I love the "Banana Leaf Salmon" that they serve.<//review>

<Review>I haven’t been to Straits in years.  I had a dinner recently to celebrate my friend’s post-birthday.  The service was the highlight of the evening, with staff refilling our water glasses regularly (even long after we finished eating and were just chatting) and the waitress offering me a complimentary glass of red wine after they ran out of my two original choices.  The perfectly prepared French Fries with two different dipping sauces was delicious. The Pad Thai and Spicy Noodle were flavorful but a tad too sweet.  The disappointment was the bland Eggplant.< /Review>< Name>

Excellent atmosphere with outdoor dining available overlooking the strip. The food was phenomenal and great portions for the price. There was a problem with my order and it took a little longer than normal, but the waitress, manager on duty, and chef all came to my table and personally apologized. Great customer service. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good Asian food.</review>

Surprisingly good food. Their laksa is pretty okay, but I was surprised to see it on the menu in the first place. The major negative about this place is the music they put on during the weekends. I think they’re trying to have some sort of lounge vibe going on, but it really ruins the vibe for the dining customers. We were unable to really converse with our group due to the noise levels. If they had full-fledge dancing I’d be cool with it, but it seemed kind of lame to be blasting top 40s for people in suits sipping cocktails on couches.< /review>

i went there for my birthday and had some appetizers and drinks during happy hour.

the spare ribs were DELICIOUS!! we also split an order of the garlic noodles which was quite tasty and a good deal considering how much food is in this little appetizer. In addition to this, the drinks were not only tasty but strong enough to give me a good start to my birthday.

to top it off you can sign up for their birthday club online and get a free appetizer with purchase of entree.< /Review>

Ordered a tasteless chicken and waffles and chicken sandwich that inexplicably took 45 minutes to make on a casual Sunday. Place was at best 30% full. Watched three other tables sit down, order, eat, and pay before we got our food. At least our server was attentive and came by to apologise about the kitchen, though I'm not sure what's going on there if other tables were getting food in a timely manner.</review>

Straits seemed like a nice enough place until we asked for a couple more minutes to look at the menu. It then took 15 minutes just to be serviced again. The food was subpar and the service throughout the meal was downright bad. I’m certain they are working hard to attend so many tables both indoors and outdoors, but I can’t recommend this place with good conscience.</text>

<Text>Selling itself as a “Singapore home style” restaurant, the reality is more “grab bag of popular dishes from India and Southeast Asia”.

Food is not bad, but overly sweet and not spicy at all. The roti w sauce was surprisingly addictive.

Ambiance is somewhere between power-outage chic and Jersey Shores pick-up bar.

Service is attentive to the point of obsequious, yet somehow still lacking …< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
I was severely disappointed. I came here after reading an article on Chris Yeo preparing poh pia with his grandmother. However, the poh pia is not like what I had in Singapore at all. :'( :'( The version served here felt like a Vietnamese summer roll miniaturized into Spanish tapas. The char kway teow lacked wok power. The laksa tasted mildly of stale prawns.</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Arrogant manager, slow service, charging for dishes they never brought to the table.

We had my husband's birthday party on Monday night, place was not busy, but it took more than 15 min to get the drink orders.
We ordered number of dishes and to be fair, food was good.
Bill had some item priced at $33, that we never got. I asked waiter to remove it from the bill. He did removed that dish, but  said that manager have SEEN that dish going from the kitchen.
Obviously, we did not receive that dish, so I asked to clarify that with manager. It took manager 20 -25 min get back to me. She not only have not apologised, she   spoke in very arrogant manner that she really see that dish going out. That was ridiculous!!! Just go and ask your waiter where did he take that dish, and apologize to your customer. They charged 20%of service fee mandatory for the big group...<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

< Review>
Straits has a really interesting mix of Indo-Chinese food allowing for a wide variety of available cuisines. I thought the food was fantastic though I didn't enjoy the "club" vibe too much. I understand that that is what it turns into in the night, but I thought it was a little too early for that when I went for dinner.< /Review>

<review>They have no clue of waiting times. We were told 30 minutes, and it took them about 105 minutes to get us a table. If you don't have space, be upfront about it. You cannot cheat. They must realize they are in customer service business, not the other way around.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

The first time that we had dinner here, it was a great and pleasant experience. So we came back. And every time it got worse... They changed the recipe I think and my favorite plate now tastes really bad. The service is terrible! I don't think that I go back again. We gave them chance... I just don't give them 1 star because of the fantastic first time experience...< /review>

First time there and the last. Food was overly priced and made me and my family of five sick with how much grease was on the food. Seriously panda express is way better than this place.< /Text>

I came here for happy hour and was a little underwhelmed.  The drinks were watered down, the order was messed up and it was so incredibly loud in there that you could barely hear anyone talking.

Not a huge fan, but still had a fun time since I was with friends!</review>

<Review>The food has declined over the years. But the service is good. If you go expect to pay $10 for a place in Man Jose. The atmosphere is good, but not worth that.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

< review>
A fly flew out of our food and then the management decided it was a good idea to be rude and condescending.  Over priced food and horrible service (at least this location).  I got in contact with corporate who said that management would call and fix things and never did.  The appetizer came AFTER the main course (how hard is it to get oysters out?).  The list goes on.</review>

<review>Didn't work out for us today. The food was horrible. We ordered from the vegetarian menu and all the dishes were pretty bad. Also they brought out the curry without bringing the rice. Overall, not a great experience. I don't know much about the non-vegetarian options but vegetarians should avoid this place.</review></record></dataset><record>

We went for the lunch on the Father's day! Horrible experience.
The food came after 30 mins of the order. The manager informed that they had only one cook. We had ordered thai tofu curry. It did not have tofu in it. The waiter was surprised too when we informed him. He came and told us that they are sorry as they are out of tofu. There was a fork to serve in the curry. The curry came 15 mins before the rice was given. Their food and service has been going down for past few times. We just pay for the ambiance for the over priced food. Can get much better food at half the price outside.< /Text>

<review>This place used to be great - that is no longer the case. Average food at best and horrible service, its almost like they are doing you a favor. Very few waiters and so expect a long wait and this exacerbates on Friday and Saturday nights.< /review>< date>

Unlike the Straits in San Francisco, this location has an outdoor patio with heaters - perfect to stay nice and toasty during the chilly bay area nights.

We have dined on the banana blossom salad, chicken satay, roti, chicken lollipops, banana leaf salmon, butter chicken, mee goreng, and a few other dishes. Everything is delicious, but can be on the greasy side and can also sometimes vary in consistency. Nothing a nice cocktail cannot wash down, I assume.

The weekends can get crowded, so be sure to make reservations.< /text>

While service isn't always the best, their food and drinks never disappoint! You can't honestly go wrong with anything on the menu, ranging from their seafood crudo, lemongrass mojitos, roti prata or black pepper lobster. I would highly recommend!< /Review>

Singapore is known for its flavorful and affordable street foods.  The high prices and loungy atmosphere of Straits misses the mark.< /Review>

I was a patron in Straits restaurant on the evening of December 19, 2013, following a shopping trip in Santana Row. My boyfriend and I stopped in to have dinner and drinks in your bar.  I inquired to the bartender that my phone was dying and was there a convenient location for me to charge it while we ate. He kindly stated he could charge it behind the bar securely next to the cashwrap.

When we went to retrieve the phone after leaving, we were handed back ONLY the charger, not the phone.  This was a brand new Iphone 5S with 2 months worth of data and content backed up over a 9 year period.

We spoke with the MOD, the bartender and were informed that security cameras could identify the culprit, although that was never done.  Instead we were told to wait until the next day when we would be contacted again by the MOD, Jonathon Young.

We contacted Jonathon the next day and he assured us he would take care of the matter and that we would be reimbursed for the phone since it was clearly stolen from one of your employees. (The bar area is supposed to be secure with only the bartender and bar back entering the secured area.)

Several emails to Mr. Young proved unfruitful. I finally received a phone call from Heather Conry, on January 8. I called her back the same day and left a message as I was traveling.  I called her back again and again, and my boyfriend also called left her repeated messages.  She likely has over 6 messages between us.  It's unconscionable to me why she would reach out initially and then have ZERO follow through.  Im not sure what kind of management team you are running there, but it's unacceptable behavior.

We are considering opting into social media to spread the word of the poor service and treatment you have of your patrons.

Is this how you run a successful customer oriented restaurant ?</Review>< Resp>

The girl servers are all pretty and thats the only reason I gave them 3 stars. The beer and drink here suck! Food: some are ok, some suck, definitely expensive but what can I say, its Santana Row. Nothing about this place that can make me come again. I just happen to go here a lot because my friends like the environment.

Theres happy hour mon-fri in the afternoon I think. Dont bother with the drink, get the food. The garlic noodles on the Happy Hour menu is pretty good, and probably the only dish that's worth it.</Review>

The best thing is that there are many menus, and the green curry shrimp is too salty. In general, the sweet and salty taste goes well together.

Vegetable Fried Rice, coconut Shrimp Fried Rice, and Pad Thai are easy to eat for those who don't like salty taste.

The recommended dessert is Lava Cake

The dessert I want to avoid is Creme Brulee because it tastes like pumpkin under the caramel. The crème bouillet goes well with the caramel and soft creamy taste... but I remember that this was a ruined dessert by ordering two.

무난하게 다 먹을수 있는 식당이다. 가장 좋은것은 많은 메뉴가 있다는것이고,그린커리의 새우는 맛이 너무 짜다. 대체로 맛은 단맛과 짠맛이 잘 어울려져 있다.

짠맛을 싫어하는 사람들이 무난하게 먹을수 있는 메뉴로는 Vegetable Fried Rice , coconut Shrimp Fried Rice, Pad Thai

추천하는 디저트는 Lava Cake

피하고 싶은 디저트는 Creme Brulee  이유는 캐러멜 아래에 호박맛이라니..진짜 아니다 싶다. 크렘뷜레는 캐러멜과 부드러운 크림맛이 어울리는데...이건 2개나 시켜서 망한 디저트였던 기억이 난다.< /text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) For those who taste from snacks... um.. entertaining can eat. A little expensive! However, it is justifiable in this place, and this is a famous shop! Come here for a taste of Southeast Asian cuisine, the sour and sweet taste is very suitable for summer!

對於從小吃這味的人來說...嗯..應酬吃吃可以。有一點小貴啊！不過在這個地點也是情有可原，而且這可是一間名店唷！來這逛街，嚐嚐東南亞美食，酸酸甜甜的味道很適合夏天的！</text>

It looks neat tho, the quality of service is redicurously low.The waiter often behave rudely.I never come here again.

It looks pretty, but the service level of the clerk is too low, so it won't come anymore. If you don't ask me to bring a spoon four times, I wouldn't bring it, or I'd like to bring home a glass even though I've had a glass of wine.

見た目は綺麗だけど、店員のサービスレベルが低すぎるので、もう来ない。スプーン持ってきてほしいと4回お願いしないと持ってこなかったり、ワインを飲みかけにもかかわらず、グラスを持って帰りたいから早く空けろとか、失礼極まりない。<//review>< Gmap_id>
