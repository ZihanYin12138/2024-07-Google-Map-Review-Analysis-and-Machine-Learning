< Review>
This place is really nice. It has a romantic ambiance, nice artwork on the walls, the food comes in large portions, and are tasty, so if you are not hungry you may need to take a grab bag home. Some of the dishes are extremely spicy, so if your palate can withstand the heat, go for it! There's a bar, and it's loaded with whatever drink or combination you can think of. The servers are nice and courteous. One of the things I admire the most is that it's an extremely clean environment.</Review>

This is NOT the same restaurant that closed last year. And am sorry but the food was the worst Indo-Chinese I have had ever.
1. Crispy Chilly Baby-corn: this was not at all crispy and soggy in turn. Taste was blah!
2. Chicken Manchurian: OMG! It seems like a watered version of any food. Literally add 2 glasses of water to turn it into an entree. The chicken was not cooked well - I mean you take a piece, cut it and it is raw in the middle. And No, I didnt ask for a medium rare :)
3. Burnt Garlic rice: i have to say this was exactly as written- burn the garlic until it turns like coal and bitter. No flavor to the rice. I have eaten uncooked rice and that might have tasted better.

I am a big fan of Indo Chinese. But this has caused me to have an aversion. Will wait a few months for friends to provide me a personal review before I try back here.< /text>

We had a wait time for about 20 minutes. The waiters were very courteous and apologized for the delay. The menu is quite unique and mostly indo-Chinese. The waiter had good knowledge about the items and offered to customize as we wanted. Many vegetarian options as well. The food was served quite quick and tasted good too. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend visiting this place.<//Text>< Date>

<text>Went here for the first time this week.  It's been in the neighborhood for awhile and I am glad we finally went.  Not knowing what to expect our party decided to do their lunch buffet.  Figured it was the best way to try a little bit of everything.  The buffet had a variety of food to try and tho I am not a fan of buffets this one wasn't the typical fare but the Indian Chinese fusion selection.  I enjoyed the tom yum chicken soup and spicy creamy fish out of all the buffet choices.  You can get chicken, meat, and veggie choices.  There was also a nice salad.  It's a nice neighborhood find.  Today we took my dad to Father's Day lunch and ordered ala cart.  The servings are family style so be aware the portions are big.  We took off one order after the waiter told us the size of the entree and glad we pared down because it would have been too much food for our party of 4.  Aside from the food the decor was very nice, clean bathrooms, and the remodel from what I think was the old Chinese place is very lovely.  Staff was very friendly, respectful, and accommodating.  I am glad this restaurant is in the neighborhood!</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyVthYNWsS2kBs98e-pNkQ_QGLiGzihpNjUPPw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Great ambience, friendly staff. It’s a good place to grab a bite of some Indo Chinese food.
The crispy chili baby corn and pan fried chili paneer are amazing.
There is plenty of seating place but the restaurant has a waiting if you go on weekends, so plan accordingly.</review>

This place is conveniently located next door to a fabulous nail salon (Tori Nail Salon). Ordered the garlic and chili noodles to go. They were pretty tasty but I would question the brown container that it comes in as it was a little flimsy to hold all those noodles.  Other than that, the service was on point and I look forward to trying some other dishes on the  menu.</Text>

My indo-chinese food craving finally found some satisfaction. Best street noodles, appetizers and soup. Do not miss manchurian and Schezwan dishes here. Schezwan rice was tasty but little dry. Sufficient quantity to share. Lava cake dessert is highly recommended. Quick service, less waiting time and helpful staff. Nice location and ample of parking spots.<//Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>The restaurant has been great so far but today it was a nightmare! We ordered hot and sour soup and they brought maunchau soup and they brought soup after 20min even when the restaurant was not busy!
The soup was extremely sour, I guess too much vinegar was poured into that!
Also when we told server about wrong soup she was hesitant to take it back so we thought to give it try but it was complete waste!

I was always a fan of this place but it was disappointing to see this.

Manager came to see us after we were sitting in restaurant for 90minites without food, and then he took server off table and brought food. And still one item was missing! Worst thing manager or no server came to check on if any item was missing!

When no one cared we decided to pull trigger and stand up and pay check and leave! We asked manager twice what went wrong but it was just random answers. We at least deserved truth but even they could not tell us what went wrong! And when we were talking the server started telling that oh it was not her fault etc. very very unprofessional blunder! We spend more than 2hours at restaurant! Unbelievable and worst manager handled blunder situation.< /Review>< gmap_id>

I ordered the same stuff i order everytime over the phone. Everything was super spicy with ton of supr hot green chillies. This has never been the case before. I had total 6 items ordered and not one of them was good. For the price of their item, I expect consistent flavor and quality of food. Just disappointed with what I had today. Not going back here again. Crossed from my list forever!<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>My indo-chinese food craving finally found some satisfaction. Best street noodles, appetizers and soup. Do not miss manchurian and Schezwan dishes here. Schezwan rice was tasty but little dry. Sufficient quantity to share. Lava cake dessert is highly recommended. Quick service, less waiting time and helpful staff. Nice location and ample of parking spots.< /Review><date>1552425226354</date><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUBpOL1W3VpXeBOslH2RzD7KN2L0gad-xBy3AZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj_nKdSZ7lFqF_CYCgUYTg5meHe8zRVloAJ1uN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYetpKoQeibmqSGgDXp4XehTlMvd5DSfpqDwg3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjw8fyVcRCjcr3Q-aPRsEPmZABLla23aqdqVHB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures></record>

This place is conveniently located next door to a fabulous nail salon (Tori Nail Salon). Ordered the garlic and chili noodles to go. They were pretty tasty but I would question the brown container that it comes in as it was a little flimsy to hold all those noodles.  Other than that, the service was on point and I look forward to trying some other dishes on the  menu.</text>

The food was out of this world. DELICIOUS. The best we have ever had. We ate the vegetable dumplings and had the wonderful manchow soup. Then we ate the fried rice with the Manchurian. Best mix. We had awesome service. We all left, stomach filled, ready to eat Inchin’s bamboo Garden again.<//review>

<text>Horrible customer service!! Very slow and rude! No one is even in the restaurant and the only employee I see is an entitled brat taking his sweet time with everything, walking as slow as possible, being rude,  and just in general showing everyone he doesn't want to be there. And I was just getting takeout. I will never go back!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dbf8eda56db545:0x252d0e213328b469<//GmapID></record>

Service was incredibly unresponsive and we were the only ones here. I had to get up three times to ask for chopsticks and for a water refill and for the check, all while the two waiters were on their phones at the bar. The food looks delicious and is fresh but it didn’t taste all the great. My mom’s noodles were too oily and my Califlower was overcooked. Very disappointed. The waiter was dismissive and didn’t ask if we needed anything or even speak to us actually. And the rice was bad! Who messes up white rice?!<//Text>

<review>I really enjoy this restaurant's fusion of Asian recipes.  The food has been fresh, well prepared and delicious.  The restaurant is nice, and the staff are welcoming.  The prices are fair and the overall experience is nice.  The recipes are unique, so my husband and I are looking forward to something new with each visit.  We had the lunch buffet, but are going back for dinner soon based on that experience.< /review>< pics>

<Text>I joined a friend for dinner on a Wed evening @ 5:45. We were the only two diners at first. By the end of our 2.5-hour experience, there were only 2 other sets of diners to enter. The hot and sour soup was incredibly spicy, so we had to get the sweet corn soup instead, which was no problem for them and very tasty. Unfortunately, the waiter, Corey, was pretty scarce all evening. He was nice enough, but we would have preferred that he take our order more quickly and visit us more often. We had to flag him down on more than one occasion. I would recommend getting your order to go.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Need to work a bit on service - there were people served around us until one of the servers (bless him!) came over & asked if we'd been helped.  Overall, great food!!  I love this place and the food is the star!!  A bit of a crowd, but not overly so.  On a Friday, I understand the business, but getting the service down is important.< /text>

<resp>None<//resp><text>The place, ambience and most importantly the food is good! (The reason for four stars). Only thing lacking is their service. Our server/waiter handed over the cheque to us when we weren't served with our remaining dishes. We thought it might be a genuine misunderstanding. But after finishing the meal, we had to wait for someone to come over again and give the cheque,then again to make the payment. So overall, the service needs to be worked upon.< /text>< date>

Need to work a bit on service - there were people served around us until one of the servers (bless him!) came over & asked if we'd been helped.  Overall, great food!!  I love this place and the food is the star!!  A bit of a crowd, but not overly so.  On a Friday, I understand the business, but getting the service down is important.< /Text>

We had a very disappointing experience at Inchin. Service was terrible, the waiter pretty much forgot about us after bringing the food out. We asked for some additional items and it never came, even though we asked for it multiple times. Food was disappointing as well. We had asked for a noodle dish we ordered to be less spicy (for kids), but it had 4-5 pieces of big red peppers and kids couldn't eat it.< /Review>

<text>I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  Just hosted a baby shower and the food was absolutely delicious!  I picked the right caterer.  Thank you Inchin's!  Wonderful staff, great menu, excellent set up and clean up. We had over 50 guests and everyone was raving about how tasty everything was.  Thank you so so much for making the party a success.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Food and sauces had depth of flavor, not just the usual fare. Ordered garlic lamb, yellow curry chicken and lamb dumplings. All extremely tasty. Loved garlic chili sauce so much, we bought a bottle. Liked all the sauces...good balance of flavors. Service exceptional and friendly. Can't wait to try rest of menu.< /Review>

Very poor customer service. Placed a to go order and they said the food would be ready in 15 minutes. They were however keen on getting the payment from us. They made us wait for about 90 minutes and they kept saying the food is getting prepared. After talking to the manager we came to know they had a lot of back order and couldnt get to prepping our food at all. Walked away getting the payment refunded.< /Text>

A friend took me to this restaurant on New Year’s Eve for lunch. I am glad I found a new chain to go to as they are in many cities across the US.  My favorite is Chinese Bhel. Here they understand what vegetarian means.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>Went there for lunch with my coworkers.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our food!  If you ask for medium spicy, it's ACTUALLY spicy.  The red chicken curry had a wonderful flavor to it.  The chicken in the chicken fried rice has this crispy outer layer to it that was to die for.  I didn't try two of the others' dishes, sweet & sour chicken and Mongolian chicken, but they said it was really good.

I'm really excited I have leftovers.  They give good-sized portions.  The staff is very friendly too.

I will definitely be back!

Small cons: The soup in the lunch combo was meh and I wouldn't eat here if in a rush.</Review>< pics>

We ordered hot and sour soup and they brought maunchau soup and they brought soup after 20min even when the restaurant was not busy!
The soup was extremely sour, I guess too much vinegar was poured into that!
Also when we told server about wrong soup she was hesitant to take it back so we thought to give it try but it was complete waste!

I was always a fan of this place but it was disappointing to see this.

Manager came to see us after we were sitting in restaurant for 90minites without food, and then he took server off table and brought food. And still one item was missing! Worst thing manager or no server came to check on if any item was missing!

When no one cared we decided to pull trigger and stand up and pay check and leave! We asked manager twice what went wrong but it was just random answers. We at least deserved truth but even they could not tell us what went wrong! And when we were talking the server started telling that oh it was not her fault etc. very very unprofessional blunder! We spend more than 2hours at restaurant! Unbelievable and worst manager handled blunder situation.</review><date>1570337178678<//date>< UserId.>

It is one of the restaurants with fine dining experience and good ambience. It will be crowded mostly. Better to book a table and go.

Food will be fresh. But u need to have little patience as delivery will take time. Cost is little bit high only.

Paneer Starter,
Chicken Starters,
Mango juice,
Fried Rice and Noodles are my favorites.

You have more vegetarian options too.<//Review>

The food is really good. Large family style portions. My one thing is that they serve enough food for like 5 people but as soon as you have enough people to actually finish it they tack on 20 percent gratuity with 5 people or more. If you are going with only 2 people you will have some left. Unless you both choose the same thing.<//Review>

I was so excited as finally I found out a halal Indo Chinese restaurant, but got so disappointed about the amount they served per food. They served very little amount of food as per the price. I have eaten at a lot of Indian and Chinese restaurants, never saw this tiny amount being served. We ordered Tom yum soup, momo and roti kanai chicken,  the chicken curry was 11$ and they just gave one tiny peice of chicken, how come!! The taste was good though.<//Review>

The noodles were very disappointing. They kind of tasted spoiled or something. I'm not sure what happened but I'm sure it was an accidental/one day thing. I tried several things and the Mongolian beef was amazing!! I also enjoyed the honey garlic or honey chili chicken. But the noodles really put me off of trying the rest of their food.</text>

Nice and interesting mix of Chinese and Indian food. I had a vegetarian yellow curry. I was not asked spice level and been given a little too spicy version (I could eat it though). Pretty pricey for the experience.< /text>

Expected a lot after eating at other places finally I dont feel like giving a try also! They are keeping dessert almost when I paid the bill. I feel like awkward and just left the place.

Both times we came were for special events. The first was a Malahat Rum and food pairing. The second was a food and wine pairing, which apparently occurs on the third Thursday of each month.  The food for both were very good, and the drinks were tasty.  The staff were friendly and attentive.

We're planning to add this place to our rotation of restaurants we frequent (e.g. Menya Ultra, Kappa Sushi, Wich Addiction, Havana Grill, etc.) especially since they have a dog-friendly bar area.

The one downside, which the restaurant has no control over, are the occasional wafts of cigarette smoke from smokers walking by.</review>

The food is very stale most of the time when you take a to-go. Me and my daughter feel sick after having that food. This is our 2nd experience. I would not recommend it.</text>

Food is OK, but I one thing struck a note with me.

All water is served in those tiny water bottles smaller than an adults hand.
The issue I see is the insane amount of ecologically damaging trash a business creates with utilizing such a huge amount of single use plastic bottles.

I can't in good conscience go to a restaurant that is doing the equivalent of burning tires for warmth.</Text>

<Review>Service maybe slow because of the rush. But if you want to try Indo Chinese food or the fake Chinese cuisine this is the best. Not joking India has a fake Chinese cuisine but it tastes very good. Thses flavours you cant imagine. Worth a try and highly recommend it. Try the deserts<//Review>< pictures>

This is like Panda Express but slightly more expensive. Had ordered delivery from here. Tried the chili chicken and manchurian. Accompanied by rice. Food is tasty but mild, not very spicy.< /Text>

The restaurant is known for its Indo Chinese fusion cuisine.  There's plenty of unique creations on the menu from the amalgamation of soy sauce and vinegar with Indian spices and profuse amounts of ginger/garlic/onions/other vegetables.  Must try Manchurian style chicken or cauliflower.  Hakka (thin) noodles are a great accomplishment.  Sweet corn soup is another delicacy.  Lunch is usually served buffet style while dinner is ala carte.  My last few experiences have been mediocre.  The burners under buffet servers were not like, and the food felt cold.  The soy sauce level in food and soups is sometimes very high.  It is a hit or miss place.  But definitely worth a visit once if you have not tried Indo Chinese grub.< /Text>

Some of the best Indo-Chinese food I've had in the US. Excellent customer service, and very generous serving sizes. The sodium levels were also much milder than other Indo-Chinese places, which is a welcome change. Overall, cannot complain at all.< /Review>

If you are looking for an indo Chinese fusion food, this would be the place at miramesa. Some dishes are good but some can definitely be way better ( my wife says my szchewan fried rice tastes better than here). Most of their appetizers are tastier than main course. Good quantity entrees, can be shared by 2.  Price $$.<//Review>

Waste of money. Ordered 4 dishes - all were bad. Tasted the same dishes in their SFO branch, but they were not at all good. Service was poor too. The rice they gave was bit old. Waste of money!

2021 update: we ordered manchow soup since they reopened and unfortunately it wasn't the same quality as before. The veg coins with gravy doesn't come with rice as side for 15$. Very expensive for the quantity and the food was very bland, nothing like their old restaurant

---

Service was good, less wait times. Food quality left a lot to be desired. On the more expensive side for a standard dinner.< /review>

2021 update: we ordered manchow soup since they reopened and unfortunately it wasn't the same quality as before. The veg coins with gravy doesn't come with rice as side for 15$. Very expensive for the quantity and the food was very bland, nothing like their old restaurant

---

Service was good, less wait times. Food quality left a lot to be desired. On the more expensive side for a standard dinner.</review>

Ordered the street chili chicken and was full of bones barely any chicken, when asked if it could be changed the server declined. Also we waited 40 mins for our food to arrive. Sub standard food and horrible customer service. Great ambiance.</Text>

Good service and tasty food. Only issue we specifically asked to make our dish extra spicy but it was just average and burnt garlic rice was barely warm. Otherwise this is my fav restaurant for indo- Chinese.<//text>

Not a Halal dining experience.  The restaurant is incorrectly advertised as being a Halal food establishment.  All patrons are told a 18% gratuity is charged automatically for a party of 5 or more.  The food does not taste good and service is poor!< /text>

<rating>1</rating><text>Thanks for ruining my date with my wife after a long long time. Firstly it was a 45 minute wait to get a table of 2, when we saw 4 of such tables were empty for all that 45 minutes. When asked, the response you get from the waiter (who by the way, was trying to do his best to manage the chaos in seating the people) is that we have to seat the people according to what we can manage in the Kitchen.. Huh ?  Are you saying your kitchen is not staffed to serve all the tables / max capacity of the restaurant.  We had to talk to the manager, who looked confused herself to get us seated.
Now coming to the food -  The Soup was served cold, Chicken rolls were oily , over priced ( 3 for $9) and Szechuan Chicken Fried Rice has no chicken in it , nothing Szechuan about it.   I literally had to fish out 4 small chicken pieces in that big bowl of rice. I ate at Inchin in Fremont and Chicago multiple times and love their food, but SD location completely disappointed us.  if this is the service and food quality they manage just because they were busy on a Friday, then it will be hard to maintain return customers. Hope they fix this soon.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dbf8eda56db545:0x252d0e213328b469< /gmapID></record>

<Text>LOVED everything about this place!

FOOD- solid 5 stars over all!

SERVICE- 5 stars! Jay was awesome! Great with recommendations and very attentive!

AMBIANCE- 5 stars!

Over all experience- 5 stars

Me and my husband were visiting San Diego with some friends this past weekend. My husband grew up in Delhi eating some of the best indian Chinese food. He wanted to try indo-Chinese cuisine. We  decided to try Inchin's despite some negative reviews and boi are we glad we did!?!

Everything was amazing! We tried the following dishes and loved every bite of it!

Chinese Bhel- flavorful 5 stars

Szcheuen dumplings- 4.5 stars

Panner 65- over 5 stars. If you are a panner lover, this is a must try!

American chopsuey- 4.5 starts. Loved it, but it could be a little less sweet

Gobi Manchurian- 5 stars we tried the one with gravy and it was super yummy.

Our friends had a bunch of non-veg dishes and they loved everything. We can't  comment on non-veg because we are vegetarians and didn't try any of the non-veg dishes.

My husband loved all his drinks. I dodn't remember what he ordered though :)

All in all, this is a great place for Indo-Chinese food lovers!< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp><user_id>112463813066844936952<//user_id><Name>Pooja Viswanathan< /Name>< pictures>

<Text>First timer. Ordered schezwan lamb and street chili chicken.. Ordinary food.. nothing schezwan about the lamb, cooking with dry hot chili does not make a random preparation schezwan.. chicken was a conglomeration of hot spices with bones in.. without any subtlety in taste.. 18 bucks each.. 15 dollar for garlic shrimp fried rice.. dry, seemed done in a haste. Highly disappointed. In San Diego, Convoy is Convoy ; Mira Mesa can’t be Convoy.<//Text></record>

Ordered the Mongolian beef. Beef was overcooked, chewy, and way too sweet. Brown rice I received had burnt hard pieces of rice throughout it. Disappointing since this was my first time eating here.</review>

< review>
Went here and after we were seated, a worker rushes out of the kitchen to the outdoor area because they burnt something on a skillet.  It got kinda smokey to the point that the waitress was coughing.  Strike 1.

The waitress finally took our order after we saw her serve what looked like a poorly plated dessert -- it was the Saucy Lava Cake, but there was no sauce and the ice cream looked like it was scooped with a paddle.  Strike 2.

She finally took our order after apologizing 3 times prior that she'll be right with us.  I ordered Chicken Thai Curry - Yellow Curry.  But I asked what was included with it.  She said a bowl of rice to which I corrected myself and asked "what's in the curry?". She says, "oh you know... stuff... peppers, and - " I interrupted her and said, "are there vegetables, like potatoes?". She looked at me as if I was the idiot between the two of us and she says this, "Oh you probably didn't know this but curry is a general term and isn't specific to one country."  She didn't say it rudely but I don't know why she said it at all.  I just wanted to know if there was going to be onions, carrots, and potatoes in my Thai yellow curry like most Thai yellow curries.  She then asks me if I ever had Indian curry, as my fiancee from India is sitting next to me.  I was kind of annoyed but I tried keeping it together.  My final question for her was if the side of rice will be basmati or Jasmine.  She again looks at me weird and says "Well, I don't know... I've never even heard of basmati rice before.". This is the same person that asked me if I ever had Indian curry before.  I then was irritated but told her it's okay, but to just ask if they have Jasmine rice.  She didn't even bother to ask and just said "we don't have Japanese rice.". And so I asked, "well, what kind of rice do you guys have?". She says, "I don't know... tsk.. California San Diego rice... I didn't even know there was all these kinds of rice." And so, I turned to my fiancee and asked her, "can we go?". And we left.  Strike 3.

I post this review not to steer people away, but hopefully to communicate to the Owner of our awful experience.  Hopefully, when we return, it'll be more pleasant.< /review>

Initial experience is very poor, ordered food for 5 people and requested chili sauce with my To go order, manager came and denied that they don’t give sauce and we have to buy a bottle that they are selling. They may have to charge for the plastic forks too, if they last. Not going again..avoid this place. They are definitely pinching pennies...gave one fortune cookie to share between 5 folks</review>

3.5 star, but for the service and the new fusion, I would give them 4 stars.

The closest Indo-Chinese  restaurant near san Diego before Inchins Bamboo Garden was in Artesia, Irvine, the place called Tangy Tomato.
Inchins Bamboo Garden is great add too Indian and Chinese cuisine and this is a perfect fusion. I am glad they took this business serious and worked hard on the Décor and interior. This place has a fusion touch to it and very classy. The location is very convenient, right in the center of the Mira Mesa mall. Also there are plenty of parking if you come through behind, next to Bowling lanes.

Even though this is first time we are here in this restaurant physically, we have ordered from here several times through Doordash. So, Inchins Bamboo Garden is not new for us, its now our go to Asian fusion food.

Coming to food, we have tasted the following
Sweet Corn Soup: Nothing special about it, on the second thought I would have ordered Tom Yum.
Lotus Root Chips: I love these chips, this would be on my order every time. It is Fried Lotus root, and very crunchy
Lat Mai Kai: The best form of chicken I have tried, better than Chicken 65, loved the onion, chilies, garlic combination. It is dried, perfectly cooked, crispy too. It will be great with Fried rice or just like that.
Chicken 65: I like this, but will not agree this is Chicken 65, this must be renamed to Chicken Manchurian. Chicken 65 must be Dry, crispier with lot of curry leaves.
Burnt Garlic Chili Fried Rice: The best rice item in the menu. If kids are eating, ask them to make it mild. They usually put lot of red chilies flakes. You can make it veggies, chicken, lamb or even shrimp.
Singapore Rice Noodle: Out go to Noodles, thin, angle hair like noodles. Not too spicy, great for Kids.
Lo Mein: Will just say OK, nothing extra ordinary about it, will not order again.
Malaysian Paratha: This is just frozen paratha heated in pan.
Lamb Hot Garlic: This is one item we did not like, bland and Lamb was not completely cooked, also it was runny more than beyond
Dessert: Fried Ice Cream - Vanilla ice cream fried covered in Egg Bread crumbs
Service was flawless, and ambience was too good.
Drinks: They have decent collection of domestic and imported beers. Also have good number of basic cocktails. I tried their New English Amber Brow ale and Mosco Mule, no complains here.
Overall this place is like 3.5 star, but for the service and the new fusion, I would give them 4 stars.

Will update more items, as we go there again.< /Text>

Initial experience is very poor, ordered food for 5 people and requested chili sauce with my To go order, manager came and denied that they don’t give sauce and we have to buy a bottle that they are selling. They may have to charge for the plastic forks too, if they last. Not going again..avoid this place. They are definitely pinching pennies...gave one fortune cookie to share between 5 folks</text>

<Time>1451552684436</Time><Review>These guys are known for their egg rolls but I came in here one day to order bun rieu (crab noodle soup) and saw from the menu that it came in different sizes. I wanted to see how big the portions were before deciding which size to buy so i asked the woman behind the counter, "How big is the small portion?" To which she replied sarcastically, "Well, it's smaller than the large size."
I decided to ignore her comment and asked the other worker, "Can I see a sample of your small container?"
I don't know about you but after a long day at work, I'm in no mood for a comment like that. I haven't been back to this place since that day. Their bun rieu sucked and it's not as if there aren't any other places to get decent egg rolls in Little Saigon.< /Review>< userid>

This restraunt has terrible service. Also, their servers are rude and I question their ability to stay in business. They lack an appreciation for customer's and do not know how to say a simple thank you. Their egg rolls sizes have decreased and they are beginning to stuff them less. I regret ever coming here and I will find a new place to order egg rolls.<//text>

<Review>Hand down, best Eggrolls.  Best cháo lòng.  Best lotus stem salad. I've been going here almost 20 years and counting.  Stopped making cháo lòng and eggrolls at home because their price is very reasonable, cheaper and faster than I can make at home.    I've noticed there are negative reviews, and someone posted pics of the place next door.  Make sure U go to the right one.  And review the correct one,  just saying.<//Review>< pics>

Bought a $65 bubbler from The Dungeon. Tried to use it but was having an issue with it not bubbling. Upon closer inspection,  the stem wasn't even attached to the bowl, as in there was a defect in the glass and the base of the stem didn't line up with the bowl. I went in and asked to get it switched out for a different one but was told to come back after 9:00pm since the manager would have to authorize it. I went in tonight and was told I cannot trade it for a non defective one nor can I get a refund because I had used it once. The reasoning is "it can't be put back on the shelf" if it's been used. It is a defective bubbler that shouldn't have been sold to begin with and shouldn't be resold, regardless. Out a bubbler and $65. Would not recommend shopping for glassware as they do not hold their products up to par and don't right their wrongs. 👎< /Text>

<text>Just want to say the owner of this place is obviously awesome and let me tell you why. After being totally outed by the fire of which we’ve all heard about, the camp fire. Rick is the first solid business owner who; when asked about sharing his business location with me to help a CAMP-FIRE survivor regroup, has extended his hand to meet with me and discuss sharing some of his space! (Shout out to high five too)

I not only love the clothing that he has because it feels great and looks awesome on campus but give him a tip of my hat for having a keen business eye when it comes to making money, for giving CSU Alumni and CAMP FIRE survivor(s) hope of re-opening the door to self sustainability. Respectfully “Hats off” from one Butte Strong to another; to Rick from Jeff Donnelly.<//text></record>

Hands down best smoke shop in Chico. Staff are always welcoming as if you are part of the family. Family run business, great atmosphere, great music always playing, best prices on glass and novelty's for great quality. Anytime I go in for something and they don't have it the next time I go in they end up having it, they are great at getting what the customer wants. Ehab (E)  is always making jokes he's a very funny guy, and always has great advice for all my smoking needs, he's very knowledgeable as well as his father (Rick). The main reason I LOVE The Dungeon is because of the staff, to be honest every smoke shop has the same stuff in them but for the past 25 years that they've been in business the hospitality and compassion for the customer and their needs are most important. Not a single time have I left The Dungeon in disappointment! DungeonBoysForLife!< /text>

<Time>1430351319455</Time><Rate>1</Rate><Text>I, with all honesty, cannot even give this business a one star rating. My very first visit to this business was on the 28th, April. I went online, and checked out all of the 'headshops' in town, and came to the conclusion that I would go and check out, 'The Dungeon" smoke shop. I went in, looked over the array of merchandise. I was not overly impressed, but hey, for all intents and purposes, there was a plentiful selection. I did not find exactly what I wanted, and therefore compromised, on a rather decent looking, bright yellow pipe, of frosted glass, with a silhouette of, Bob Marley. After using the pipe, I decided to clean it. I took a q-tip, and some hot water and proceeded to clean. As the cleaning proceeded, I realized that the yellow was coming off. After further examination, and a bit more cleaning, I realized that the 'yellow' was not infused within, rather, the inside of the pipe was simply hand painted yellow. I was furious that I was sold not only and inferior item, but also, and item that eventually would have damaged not only my lungs, but my very life. I went back the next day, intent on at least getting an exchange. A friend came along. I was greeted by two men, one, the son of the owner, the other, a large red headed guy. I will admit, that my attitude upon entering was borderline surly, though, I never raised my voice. After explaining the situation, I was bluntly told that it did not matter to them. I bought the pipe, and used it, therefore it was not returnable, and, the son of the owner told me that there would be no exchange either, and to get out of his store. He made it succinctly clear that He did not care about my displeasure, or the quality, ( or lack of ), of the pipe. At this point, not only did I become incensed, but so did my friend. After a bit of attempting to calm the situation,  the large red headed guy became a bit verbally aggressive towards myself, and my friend. We were told to get out, threats of calling the police were made, on both sides, and if we had any more issues, we could bring it up with the father. I returned 2 hours later, as instructed, to not find the father there. The owners son was there, and still, with disdain, he informed me that I was not going to get an exchange or a refund. Suffice to say, at this point, all civility went out the door. I made it clear that at least, an exchange was going to happen. I also made it clear that I knew for a fact that this smoke shop sold drug paraphernalia to minors. After a silence of 5 minutes, I was given a decent exchange. I will never go back to this establishment. It is a prime example of the type of smoke shops that ought to not be in business. I will take my business to, Blaze N J's, or, Dragon Tobacco.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Gotta give 2 stars for changing your hours to be closed on the weekend and not updating the hours. Just wasted a buncha time driving here for nothing. That said, best grow shop in the area. When they’re open!

Edit: how could anyone who works make it to this store to get what they need. Closed on the weekend and only open for 5 hours during the week. That’s no good.<//text>

Customer service and knowledge was far superior than any large retail store. The prices were better as well. Junior helped us through the entire process of growing plants we are unfamiliar with. Highly recommend going for the products and the knowledge we gained on growing!<//Review>

This is my first year growing plants and was recommended to S. Bay Hydroponics by a good friend of mine. The service, prices and advice which I got from the store (esp Seth) was amazing!

Seth helped me set-up my garden step by step and gave me detailed instructions on what exactly I should do, what I should avoid and what the steps in the future will be. In addition to all the priceless valuable information he gave me, he also gave me a few discounted rates on some of my purchases and never tried selling me stuff which I may not have needed. I am so confident and pleased with the prices at S. Bay Hydro that I do not even need to go compare prices with other locations because I am that confident that this store has the best rates.

More than the pricing of their products, it is the quality customer service which has made me a lifelong customer to this store. Even if I do not need anything, I will make sure to drop by to see Seth once a week so I can give him updates on my plants and get feedback to any questions I may have. I believe what has made me so comfortable coming here and working with Seth is that I never feel he (they) is (are) rushing to answer my questions and always (emphasis on always) makes time to explain everything to me fully and in details.

I look forward to coming to this store every week and am very thankful I have found individuals who are so willing and passionate to help individuals like me! I would seriously be lost without them!

Thank you S. Bay Hydroponics and I look forward to touching base again soon!<//Text>

<Text>Seth and his staff at hydroponics are not only knowledgeable but you can tell they care about taking the time to inform you about all the products they offer.  I have spent many hours speaking with Seth and he has given me advice and recommendations that have been very helpful.  In addition the prices at South Bay Hydroponics are the lowest I have seen and they offer a discount just for signing up an in store account.  I highly recommend south bay hydroponics for new and experienced growers of all kinds.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808e34cc5b6f103b:0x350a40c941eaf0da< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have been doing a lot of research online for starting my first grow. Came to South bay Hydro and was amazed by the amount of knowledge and time spent explaining tips and tricks that I should know for successful runs. Didn't try to "sell' me on anything and that, to me was the best part. I would highly recommend this shop and will be returning for my needs. Talk to Seth.<//Text>

<Review>A few weeks back my husband sent me South Bay Hydroponics to pick up some soil and fertilizer.  As I didn't remember exactly what he requested and wasn't able to get in touch with him at work I was a little nervous about coming home with the right thing.  Needless to say the staff at the shop was beyond helpful, answered all my questions, made recommendations and most importantly made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process.  I ended up getting exactly what he wanted and they also made a recommendation on a fertilizer that was even better than he originally requested.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back again and would highly recommend this place to newbies like myself!< /Review><date>1392590104427</date>< Pics>

Staff was blah blah they don't answer your questions all they say it's "there are a lot of options". They just do their job they don't help customers they talk faster and they are naive they don't respond to you to help you. Everything is expensive here and I really think no one would spend thousands (sometimes hundreds) of dollars for stupid trees or tree related stuff. Marijuana growers better goto other stores or order online. Staff has no basic idea of growing anything. It's not a customer friendly place they just want to bill you more even tho you wasn't there with your gf for shopping.<//text>

Seth, Jake, and Andrew all 3 of these fellas have been huge help for me, I came in not knowing anything and they stayed patient and helped me all the way through it. All 3 of them are very knowledgeable and have some hands on experience themselves, great place to come if your looking to start an indoor garden or expand the one you already have!< /Text>

South Bay Hydroponics is one of the best Hydro places around the Bay. the customer service was Great. everyone in this place really knows what they are talking about. the prices are really good and they are willing to work with you... they ALL go out of there way to make sure u know what u need to know, to have a successful garden.. ONCE AGAIN! SOUTH BAY IS A GREAT PLACE TO GO, Great customer service everyone..

nvm what ppl say about waiting in line. you cant help it when alot of people come in and  it takes longer then 30 sec to get helped. i mean really get over your self and learn patience.. GREAT PLACE TO GO/</text>

Southbay Hydro is exceptionally well stocked. Jay and Seth are very knowlegable and friendly. I have also visited the Sunnyvale location which is great, but Bascom is by far my favorite. Remarkable staff! Remember, good customer service is key. Keep up the good work and get me on the list for the next grow show in frisco next year.

Thanks guys!

<Review>This wine shop is my go-to shop whenever I ran out of stock of wines in my place. The reason that they had a huge range of wines to choose from at a very affordable price. The staff here was so knowledgeable and expert about the wines. Also, I love this place because it had a great atmosphere. It was so cozy and warm as well. This place is really great for a drink and to relax as well.< /Review></record>

My partner and I had dinner here last night. Aside from having the best wine in the city, this wine shop also caters diners where you can spend your special occasions intimately with their picturesque ambiance. They also had mouthwatering and tasty menus. This wine shop is the best in the city! They had a wide selection of wines and beers, too!<//text>

It's a wine shop with many bottles, but the heart of this shop is Michael. He is a wonderful, easy-going, and friendly person who gives you taste many wines with poetry and philosophy.

<Review>My husband and I visited for a couple of bottles of wine because we wanted to take it to lunch at a local restaurant. Never did we imagine that we'd come out having the most beautiful wine experience but also meeting a new friend. The owner is knowledgeable, friendly, and is an excellent storyteller. It's more than just about drinking the wine, and it is about experiencing the joy of it with the people you love!< /Review>< Pictures>

It’s a very simple wine shop unlike others, because they make you feel like home, and try different types of wine. The wine tasting experience was outstanding! Sofia is very professional and attentive to introduce us to the different harbor of wines, and she even prepared some cheese for us. I strongly recommend this fine wine shop for those wine lovers!</Text>

<review>It feels like a great spot to settle on and visit. Order bottles of wine and choose your cheese plate at the wine bar as you enter cocktails on the upper level and food at the back of the outside courtyard.  If you are looking for great wine and chill place outside, then this is the right place for you!< /review>< Time>

<review>My friends and I wanted to visit this shop last night and, frankly, we had a lot of fun. The champagne and the wines were great and very fine. The waiters/waitresses, in addition, were very welcoming, friendly, and patient. Honestly, we enjoyed hanging out in your shop greatly. It was clean, it was not crowded, and it was cool. Next time till!<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>The best wine store in town! This is the best shop if you're looking for a decent range of drinks and alcohol at a reasonable price. I was here last week and spent a lot of time in their welcoming setting. Pizzas, noodles, and sliders are among the snacks and menu items available. We had such a great time when we were here!< /Text><response>None<//response><Time>1614951384411< /Time>< userid>

It has the impression of a very high-end wine store, but the prices are much more reasonable.< /Review>< UserId.>

I love this place. The staff is accommodating, the service is good, and there are a lot of wines to choose from. I and my brothers love going here to drink wines. The wines are stored well, and the owner was very knowledgeable about wine and food pairing. Their location is very convenient too. I wouldn't go anywhere else in the future. Thank you!<//text>

Yesterday afternoon, I went to this wine shop. Concerning the menu and wine list, the server was well versed. I was pleased to see that he had at least one Sauvignon blanc from the rest of the world. My meal went well, and the crab dinner was also fabulous. I recommend this place very much!</text>

<review>Excellent wine tasting! They have very friendly staff who talked to us through the world of Argentinian wines. We could order glasses of different wines even if the bottle wasn't opened yet. Excellent service. The Chardonnay and White Zinfandel were the best we could find in here so far. We totally recommend this place if you look for good wine.</review></record></dataset><record>

I don't know a lot about wine. I told the person working there what I typically like to drink and here guided me to a couple options. He was patient with my questions. He was able to find me just the right wine. It is so delicious and just what I was craving! I'll be back for sure.< /Review>

A great shop whether you’re a wine expert or a wine rube (like me). Staff will work patiently with you to ask what you like and what you don’t and will find just the right bottle for your tastes. Don’t be intimidated if you don’t recognize the labels or even the particular styles. Trust the pros at Psychic Wines and you’ll be happy.< /Review>

Such an amazing shop. They've been open for a few months and I already know I'll be coming here quite often. Very knowledgeable staff, helpful in showing me how their wines are organized as it was my first time there they also can guide you to particular styles. Amazingly they only carry natural wine. Very dedicated to natural wine, you can tell they have such passion for it.<//Text>

The prices are very reasonable and ranging from everyday to special occasion wines. I love that the focus of the store is on natural wines!

Geek squad was useless and two other places in town both said good luck. Took it to RCR, they said sure we think we can fix it. Had to send for parts but two weeks later it was back, powered up and just like new.

<text>I'm SUPER GLAD I did some research and called around. I had originally went to IGuys on mooney for an Iphone 7 plus repair because the audio for calls wasn't working. Long story short, this is the place that IGuys sends customers' devices to when they can't do the repair. RCR charged me a quarter of the price I was told from IGuys for the same exact repair. It even took RCR less than a week to fix. All three of the techs I spoke to there were very friendly and helpful. RCR and the three guys working there made the entire process extremely smooth and easy. Plus the 90 day warranty they give backs up the fact that RCR is confident in their work. Will 100% be coming back for any future repair needs. Bonus points to RCR for not smelling like smoke/weed. This is a business done right.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Knowledgeable staff, fair prices. This is the only local repair shop I've found that actually sells components. I purchased a charging port for a tablet and it was in stock at a good price. I haven't purchased a repair service yet but I was impressed with their level of professionalism. A++</review>< Pics>

< Review>
A year or so ago my cpu took a hit and toasted my rig, I was pretty distraught as I had a lot of valuable data on my hard drive, I looked everywhere for a reasonable repair place.
I found RCR and am I glad I did, I was called almost hourly and given a status report on my computer and what exactly needed repair or replacement.

Once the job was complete I was even told what might be needed to be repaired or replaced in the future and what upgrades I might want to look into, long story short I ended up replacing almost my entire machine and yes the hard drive data was also saved.

This is by far the best repair center in the valley and I'd bet in the state, made props and I'll be returning again once the need arises.< /Review>

Very professional repair shop, well deserving of its high rating. Knowledgeable and fair about pricing. Completed my repair in a timely manner at a good price. If you need a repair or need to get something diagnosed, this shop is definitely worth checking out.< /text>

<Text>This guy knows what he is doing. I took him a motherboard from a random network device and he fixed it. I accidentally broke the charging port and not only he fixed it but made it more sturdy. Price was fair, not high or low. My device was about 1k and I was afraid he was going to mess it up more but he actually fixed it fast and good.  He charged me $80 and I am happy with the service.
I highly recommend him for any electronics.< /Text><date>1576601637095<//date>< rate>

< review>
Wasnt going to post this but i thought i should Came in November of last year I took my ipad pro to get the lcd screen replaced and fix the power button. when i got it back i noticed the Power button was gold and not rose gold like my ipad and the screen was popping up at the top. I called and he told me to bring it in which i did, he said it would be about an hour. when i got it back he said that he used the better “ adhesive” , then he told me that the screen looks like a tortilla?? Anyway, I brought the ipad home and noticed the screen was popping up from the right side now and the middle of the screen is bulging out so i sent him a text message to let him know. I also noticed that my rear facing camera is scratch from the inside? Really wish they would have done a better job. I gave 2 stars because they did replace the lcd but the screen doesnt seem to be the correct fit for my ipad pro .</review>

<review>Abel did a great job repairing our laptop. Our laptop was experiencing display issues, he was able to find a mother board for a 13 year old laptop and got it working like new. His work is good quality. If you have a laptop or phone that needs repair, look no further...Able is your guy. His prices are very reasonable.</review>< pics>

Great service.  Showed me parts that another shop either broke or didn't put back into the phone after multiple times going back for a screen replacement.  Other shop couldn't get the top of the screen  to sit in the frame  RCR replaced the screen and got the screen properly installed and replaced other parts broken or missing from other shop at a GREAT price and very fast service.  My new go to shop THANK AGAIN FOR THE GREAT SERVICE.</Text>

I went in for just a quote for a cracked LCD on a Moto Z3.  Initially the employee couldn't find the part but suggested I speak to the owner the following day.  He found the part, quoted me a fair price and fixed it in less than a week.    What more could you ask for?< /Text>

RCR repair  should be your only stop for game console or phone repair.  The man behind the company is always on top of his game, and I really appreciate his honesty especially in an industry where one can easily be mislead.  I've been a satisfied customer of his for a few years now and he's always delivered quality work.   He's repaired two Xboxes and a couple phones for me.   His passion for the work he performs is outstanding as he does more than the industry standard to ensure the repairs are done correctly and exceed the manufacturer's specifications.   His pricing is also reasonable and I definitely get more than I paid for.
best policy ever if he cant repair there is no charge !!!< /Text>

<review>I took my phone to another shop for a screen repair, after they were done my phone would no longer turn on. Mind you it was working perfectly fine before. The shop told me my phones motherboard got shorted and it was no longer repairable. I found RCR Repair on Yelp and brought it in to them. Abel was able to get my phone up and running within 24 hours. I was so glad I did not have to purchase a new phone! Highly recommended! He also fixes computers tablets and tvs. Thank you Abel!!!</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80952f64f88cf183:0xde327f0b30f30a70< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>I had previously went to another shop and it was complete BS. My touch screen wasn't working and the guy said he had done everything possible to get it fixed and recommended I get a new iPhone 6. I found this place and gave it a try. The guy Abel was very specific about the details that was wrong with my phone. turns out the guy who supposedly did everything possible never even touched my phone and put  tape on the chip of it. He did this method called microsoldering. Took about a day or two and my phone was like brand new!!!!! Very honest and trustworthy and for sure going back !! 👍🏻🙂< /Text>< rating>

Abel was able to transfer all of my photos, contacts, text messages, etc from a blacked out Samsung Note 5 to a new one. He was very professional and was the only one in the area who I felt gave me a reasonable price for doing so. If I ever run into any other problems with any electronic devices, RCR will be my number one choice. Highly recommended!!</review>

<Text>I found an ad he had posted and set up a time I could come in. He was very polite and passionate about his job he went beyond just fixing my iPhone 6 Plus in giving me details about what are the do’s and dont’s to keeping the phone in great condition. I highly recommend this guy he knows what he is doing and I can tell he LOVES his job! He is number one on my list!<//Text>< Date>

Tiny Frog is simply amazing. They are not your cookie cutter "all we care about is the sale" firm. Every single person I worked with was professional, knowledgeable, and creative. They really are experts in their field. I appreciated that they listened and dug deeper to determine what I want and help me define the vision for my practice's online presence. I would recommend them without hesitation and look forward to further collaboration in the future.</review>

We hired Tiny Frog for our website redesign in 2018, after getting bids from two competitors as well. Mikel & his team made the strongest impression from the very beginning. The level of quality, professionalism, and customer service they provided was AND continues to be unmatched!

As a consumer, I have really high standards while also keeping budget in mind. Tiny Frog has consistently met or exceeded my expectations at a competitive price. Delivering on time and on budget is a non-negotiable for me and Tiny Frog clearly shares those same values.

It’s now been two years since that initial project and the Tiny Frog team continues to provide exceptional customer service. Chelsea is super responsive any time I have reached out with a question or concern. She is a proactive problem-solver and goes out of her way to ensure an outstanding customer-service experience.

I cannot recommend Tiny Frog enough for all of your website needs!!</review>

<Review>Tiny Frog Technologies is one of the best options you can find for all-around website services, whether you're building a new site, modifying an existing one, or simply maintaining a site that already works well. They're quick, professional, and creative with their ideas. In an industry that's flooded with options, you would be making a prudent, effective selection with this team.</Review><Resp>None</Resp></record>

I needed a local SD webpage developer & found TFT via an online search.  Went to their website, they have instant messaging, employee rep “Chelsea Barrett” comes on & doesn’t even answer my basic Qs, ? offerings, basic turnaround time & a ballpark price for simple new website.  She won’t answer these & then says “someone” in their “Quote Dept” will “get back” to me later that day or soon?  No one ever called from TFT, but I did get a call a few hours later by an OUTSOURCED private biz guy who gets “REFERRALS” from them for “small jobs” (he says that typically bid less than $10,000. or so).  At least he tells me his story & truths & that TFT then TAKES 10% “FINDERS FEE” from him for everything he then does for me.  Omg.  Never told any of this by dirty & lying & SCAMMING Chelsea or her bosses, esp the biz OWNER, Mikel Bruce.  Totally unethical & DIRTY & unprofessional ways & tactics.  Never told any of this!

Beware.  Caveat Emptor.  Avoid.<//review>

<Review>I loved working with the TinyFrog web team! This was my first experience with this group, and it was exceptional. From the initial phone conversations to project kick-off and completion, every step of the way was clearly detailed and executed. They brought great ideas and suggestions, and responded immediately when we had a shopping cart issue on the weekend. I and the rest of the OxyStrap team really love the new website – thank you TinyFrog!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

From the very beginning, when we met Mikel, Tiny Frog made everything easy. Communication was very open and clear, and developing the website was a collaborative effort that taught me and the rest of my team a great deal about website design.

I truly look forward to working with Tiny Frog on any future projects.< /Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Hands down, this is the best web design company out there.  I needed to re-design my company's website and feel very lucky to have found and signed up with Mikel and his team at Tiny Frog here in San Diego, Ca. Mikel is real professional, and has developed a team that can take your vision and make it happen. Ben absolutely did an outstanding job on the design and nailed it in every aspect. He was an awesome listener and is by far the most talented person I have worked with for website design. Andrea, my website development contact, was so nice and helpful in the build-out of my site. Her department's crew have some top-notch skills and really instill a sense of confidence that they are pros at what they do. And I can't forget Chris for all of his help maintaining all the systems for my site.

I feel valued as a customer by the entire team at Tiny Frog and wouldn't hesitate to recommend anyone looking to build (or refresh) their website. Thank you Tiny Frog!</Review><response>{'time': 1510602152151, 'text': 'Thank you for the fantastic review, Patrick!

Tiny Frog did an incredible job designing and implementing my website from start to finish. I am "technically challenged" though their patience and ease of explaining things made that aspect simple.  I worked with three different people - one for design, one for content, and one for the technical side - and each was wonderful.  They had great communication transitioning me to the person involved in the next phase all remained informed and available.  They were reliable, timely, friendly, and incredibly professional. Most importantly, I seriously love my website and an associated brochure they designed.  I would highly recommend Tiny Frog for anyone looking for a top notch company for web development.<//review>

Mikel and his team are OUTSTANDING!!! I have been working with Tiny Frog for about 3 years now and they do not disappoint! Mikel is always so quick to respond to all of my emails and calls. Sometimes he gives me simple advice and other times he sets me up with someone on his team to do some in depth work on my websites. He's always helpful, never rushes, extremely generous, and very friendly. His team is great at communicating and makes sure that you are involved in every step of the way. They always make sure you are 100% satisfied with the work they're doing. They have showed me how to make minor adjustments to my websites so I don't need to call them for every little thing, but when I do have a minor question, they help me immediately. They send out great little emails that have a wealth of knowledge in them every so often as well. If you need branding, re-branding, website design, a website built, etc... Tiny Frog is your team!!</review>

Tiny Frog was a pleasure to work with. Their entire team was professional, courteous, and expeditious in their efforts. They helped our company, MRP Training Solutions, re-design our website and they brought it up to a level that our team can be truly proud of. While everyone on the Tiny Frog team was excellent, most of our time was spent with Andrea. She was great to work with, provided excellent recommendations on content and layout, and always acted quickly. I strongly recommend Tiny Frog for all website design and management needs. Thank you.< /review>

In 20 years of business I've had several websites built, this was the first time it was seamless, stayed within my budget and the attention to detail was exceptional.

<Review>I worked with Jessica and Monica to develop a website for my start-up. I only had a small amount to spend but of course, wanted a high quality page and these ladies delivered! They were prompt, creative and responsive and made me feel like they really cared about my project, even though it was small. My experience with all company members has been fantastic, very attentive and professional. Their approach to a small order like mine is testimony to their integrity. There are lots of companies that will pay attention to big budgets, but Tiny Frog and its staff have demonstrated they are genuine as well as talented and for that I recommend them wholeheartedly for anyone who wants quality at a fair price.< /Review>< pics>

“I've had the pleasure to work with Tiny Frog Technologies on two separate occasions. Both times, the experience was professional, rewarding and informative.

The team is an exceptional group of very talented and skilled individuals who went above and beyond to accommodate our vision. I should mention that they created a business website as well as a nonprofit website - websites requiring vastly different components and "feel."

It is a pleasure to recommend them.”<//Review>

We needed to update our website and I found TIny Frog on-line. They had wonderful reviews! When I first called I was so impressed by the personal attention I received that I knew this was the company for us. They referred us to a website developer who was in the price point for small business. However, we use Tiny Frog as our hosting service. They are always available to answer questions and provide a personal customer service that is so hard to find these day. The people at Tiny Frog feel like family in the way we feel supported. They even remember us on our birthday. Thank you TIny Frog for your exceptional customer service!!!<//Text>

Tiny Frog did a great job upgrading the look and feel of our WordPress website, and we love our new "face"! Carole, the website designer, came up with a clean and elegant design for our fine art appraisal  business. Mary managed everything in between the design and the back-end, and facilitated the incorporation of the old content with the new. She also provided a walk-through of the back end so that we could edit it ourselves in the months and years to come. Everybody at TinyFrog was so easy to work with and professional.  We recommend TinyFrog to anyone looking for an updated design!< /Review>

I have been working with Mikel and his team for several years now. They are the greatest!  Extremely responsive, professional and my web site looks excellent.  Their prices are extremely reasonable, and they do incredible work. I am not a creative type (CPA) but they are able to talk to me in a language that I can understand, and they ask questions to make sure they are capturing the essence of what I'm trying to communicate with my web site.  They are able to take that information and translate it into something that really tells the public who we are and what we do.  They deliver a product of high quality, for less cost than the competition. I feel confident recommending them to my clients and friends as well.</Review>

<Response>{'time': 1533527162083, 'text': "We're very sorry to hear your feedback, Karl. We've never had a TinyFrog employee post a review for us on any review platform & customer service is very important to us.\n\nAll of our websites are fully custom designs and we don’t use any templates. But, as we tried to explain, we do follow best practices for user experience and conversion optimization. One of those best practices is to make sure that the web visitor can find the information they are looking for & achieve their goal on the site. Because web visitors spend very little time on a website before deciding to leave, many sites have a similar structure for how the content is organized. Our web strategist was working with you to organize your business information into a logical, intuitive format and that was the purpose of the wireframe stage.\n\nWe then were creating a custom design based on that wireframe. We do understand your frustration during the design process. Since you only had a few custom photos for the business, we were using more stock images from Getty and although they were high-quality photos, they did make the site look less customized.\n\nBefore you decided to cancel, we put a lot of work into the project, spending time on research and the wireframing process and then creating multiple design mock-ups for the home page.\n\nWe apologize that there was such a misunderstanding and we didn’t meet your expectations. Based on our last discussion together, we really felt that if we had continued the project, we could have delivered a high-quality, custom website for your business.\n\nWe really hope everything works out with the website project and you continue to see success in your business."}< /Response>< date>

<Review>** Beware of reviews posted by employee's **  We hired Tiny Frog for a new website project, we were referred by our digital marketing company, after conference calls with Mikel we were lead to believe that we would get a custom website designed to meet our needs, we hired them and went to work, it was quickly apparent that what we were going to get was an assembly line, cookie cutter website, when we brought our concerns to Mikel, his response was that their website designs worked, and that most of their sites were designed in a similar manner for that reason. We decided to go with another company and terminated the agreement, we were charged a very large amount of money for a home page wire frame and 3 web design concepts, not understanding how we made such a mistake in hiring this company, I went back and re-read their online reviews and was very disappointed to see several reviews from employees that had actually been working on our project!! I guess that explains the perfect scores?<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I own a digital marketing agency and have used many web design companies over the years.  My experiences with design, reliability and professionalism have varied greatly between companies and we have had trouble finding a web design company that we felt comfortable sending our clients to as we are putting our own name on the line when we do so.

I can assure you that after we starting working on mutual projects with Mikel and his team at Tiny Frog that we now send every single client to them as we can stand behind their work as much as we stand behind ours.  They are professional, very responsive and most importantly do great work.  My highest recommendation!</text>< pictures>

We worked with TinyFrog to design and develop our new website. We were just launching our new business and they provided us a full team of resources from web strategy and design to search marketing and development. They walked us through each stage and guided us into the creation of what we feel turned out to be a wonderful product. Our site has been a huge success increasing our credibility with potential clients and improving our sales close ratio.

Tiny Frog is our go to web design and development firm and I refer all of my business network to them. I know they are in good hands.<//review>

They consider the needs of a business before beginning to design, becoming a thoughtful partner in the web creation process rather than a website vendor. The team is skilled and responsive, attentive to detail, and determined to deliver not only a great final product but a quality customer experience. For busy companies that need to refresh or create a new website, Tiny Frog's team is the solution you have been looking for.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

If you have a Wordpress site, don't launch it without Tiny Frog. I had mine hacked and, in less than 48 hours, the company had my site restored and secured to prevent such a reoccurrence. My fault for not bringing them on as I launched it. They are a VITAL digital marketing foundation for ANY organization!</review>

We selected TinyFrog from a short list of companies to create a new website for our business due to their vast experience, interactive designs and attention to detail. Their strategic insight resulted in immediate rapport where alignment of goals was reached from day one. Professional staff performing exceptional work, from strategy to implementation. We have already seen a tremendous increase in online customer engagement through their work. It's been great working with such a talent team and will definitely work with them again in the future for other projects!<//Text>

< Review>
There are a lot of web developers out there, many with great talent to create websites based on exactly the way you want your website to look.  You write the content, give them a specific look you want, and they create it.

We did this with our first two  websites, and had with mediocre results.  We had low traffic to our site and no engagement.

I was in talks with a third developer.  She wanted to know, yet again, how I wanted my site to look.  I told her this: "I need someone to tell me what my site should look like.  I'm not in the website development business, you are.  Frankly, I don't care if there are purple dancing monkeys on my website...if it makes people respond, then that's what I want."  Her reply?  She can't do the design to make visitors respond, and it'll cost me thousands of dollars to get a company to help me with the research and design.

After doing some homework, I found Tiny Frog.  Their hook for me was that they not only wanted to get people to the sites they create, but they also want them to respond.  What a novel concept!!  So I signed on with them.

At my first meeting with Tiny Frog after signing, there were five representatives in attendance from their company: a web strategist, an SEO specialist, a designer, a project manager, and the CEO.  I immediately felt like I was getting my money's worth and would have a good product.  They each had a role:  the web strategist sought to understand my clients and what would make them respond, not only from a look-and-feel angle but also from a content angle.  The designer worked in harmony with the strategist, while at the meeting, to come up with some design ideas that met those concepts.  The project manager put details to the project timeline and milestones.  And the SEO specialist shared in the strategy by discussing what he will do.  And Mikel, the CEO?  He was there to keep the vision for the site at the center of the meeting.  He participated as needed and yet left his team to be the experts he hired them to be.

The result?  I'm very happy.  For once, it's a site I'm proud of.  More importantly, I think our clients engage with it much more effectively.  We get responses!

Thanks Mikel and team for a job well done.< /Review>

I highly recommend Mikel and the team at TinyFrog Technologies. We worked on a custom web site and I am very particular and have an eye for detail. I put the team to the test, having them make numerous tweeks and adjustments and a lot of "can we do this...". Well, the team came out a winner. They were able to respond to all my challenges and work their magic! And just as important, Mikel and the team are a complete stand-up crew; trustworthy, honest, and courteous. Thank you!< /text>

TinyFrog provided the website update my law firm desperately needed, and they did it quickly and painlessly. In a world where accountability and timeliness have almost disappeared, TinyFrog was a pleasant surprise. From day one until launch, they were in constant contact with my firm. And they actually took the time to think about my firm and what sets us apart from the crowd. I would recommend them to everyone.< /Text>

<Response>{'time': 1462905466703, 'text': "Aaron, what a story! We're so glad we were apart of it and it was a happy ending. Mikel, Raymond and the rest of our TinyFrog team really enjoyed working with you and hope to continue to support you and your website needs.  Don't be a stranger!"}</Response><pictures>None<//pictures><review>We had originally contracted a company in Arizona who gave us a good quote to design and develop our website back in October 2014, it was due to be completed by Feb 2015. Communication started pretty well and I am confident we gave good direction which included a complete web brief and drawings of our expectations, we also paid a partial payment of $5,000. Shortly after signing the contract the designer went missing no calls no emails for over 2 weeks which is not great given the time scale we were working on, we did eventually hear back but it would take at least 24 hours to get an email reply (probably because the work was being shipped to India) and I could send in excess of 7 - 10 emails a day trying to get a simple answer, by the time Feb 15 passed we knew that the company was never going to produce the goods so we cut our losses. We thought it would be better to go with someone local that we could meet face to face, but little did we know that this wouldn't work out - the problem is a lot of designers and web design companies over promise what they can do and being that our project is a simple WP site I was flabbergasted that once again we had fallen into a trap (even though this guy was a recommendation and had good reviews) - and wasted our money on someone who claims they can build websites in 7 days! So we started to develop the site ourselves the problem being is that we do not code, we don't know PHP or CSS - so we became stuck - Luckily enough I remembered in my initial research a company called Tiny Frog, so we reached out to Mikel the President and he kindly done some trial work for us so that we could see how good they were - A long story short (well as much as I can) is that Tiny Frog are a complete breath of FRESH AIR! All of our problems and coding was completed within 24-48 hours with step by step communication, not only just email communication but one of their developers, Raymond, who is great by the way, would send personal video instructions on what to do and how to do it - We now use them daily and they also support us with a great managed service for our websites - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<//review><user_name>Aaron Wells< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

On a smartphone or tablet, my website is clean and crisp...a quick-read that stands out from other sites that are cluttered and "noisy" and impossible to read or navigate. Tiny Frog is a joy to work with. I don't know what I would do without them.</Text><date>1434760358580<//date></record></dataset><record>

Mikel and the staff at TinyFrog always impress me. Any training I've needed on the backend of the site has been such an enjoyable experience because everyone there is so kind, knowledgeable and patient with my many, many questions. When I've needed extra help or explanation, I've always received immediate attention along with genuine concern because Mikel and his team truly care about the work they do and that their clients have websites that help them thrive. It's very clear that TinyFrog wants their clients' businesses to be successful, not just their own. The amount of integrity and sincerity here is incredible and I've enjoyed my experience with them very much.< /Text>

<Text>Mikel and his team at TinyFrog are a pleasure to work with. They are professional, creative, and overall very customer oriented. I personally worked with Lalena on a non-profit project. Her responsiveness and attention to detail helped us troubleshoot and implement updates to our website quickly to help make it more user friendly. Highly recommend TinyFrog to anyone looking to create or update their website and web presence.</Text>< Pictures>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>I recently switched my web hosting, maintenance and support to Mikel and his team at TinyFrog Technologies.  From the moment our business relationship started, I received professional and timely responses to my questions.  Throughout my transition to TinyFrog, Chris and Mikel provided status updates so I never felt like I was in the dark.

I recommend working with TinyFrog for people who want to be treated with respect, listened to, and supported in ways that will truly protect one of your business' most important assets, your website.</Text><Time>1441861110352</Time><gmapID>0x80dbfe36c163bbb1:0xac84829d97a60146<//gmapID></record>

I had a lot of available options but the moment I spoke with Mikel and his team, I was hooked.  Clients are treated as VIP's, each with a customized, crafted team assembled to address their individual specific needs.  TinyFrog brings a collaboration of strategy, trendsetting design and customer service that ensure a best-in-class outcome for all of their clients.  I know I made the right choice to work with the TinyFrog team and I have, and would, recommend to all my friends and peers.</Text>

AWFUL!   LETTUCE  on both sandwich  and in salad was rotten! Brown & slimy rotten! The cake & cookie were so old they were uneatable.   Only thing I could stomach, was the soda.  I was too far away to return, by the time I was able to eat.  Oh, the burger & the bun were both  BURNED! I CAN'T  STAND BURNT FOOD!  Pic. Att.  All was thrown out.  Stopped latter at a Taco Bell.  Food OK for both of us.< /text>

Both service and food was very good!!
We ordered a burger that actually came with regular whole lettuce rather than shredded lettuce. We had another Carl's jr. Wanting to charge us extra for regular lettuce, not shredded. We would eat here again. Dave..</text>

The food is usually what you expect it to be. The place maintains itself pretty clean and I have never had any sort of issues with this location. Employees do come and go so the service may vary from time to time. But I say that as someone that has lived in the area 20+ years.. this location also has a children's outdoor play area that get the job done..</Text>

<Text>Waiting in the drive thru at 10:05 pm (10/24/19)....... and no one has answered the drive thru. It’s going on 6 minutes and normally they don’t close until 11pm.

Stopped here just before Easter for a quick bite. Clean and quiet. The staff were very helpful, to a couple of Brits, and the food was quite acceptable for a burger chain. We were happy.<//review>

Horrible service. Employees need to learn customer service and avoid arguing with each other in front of customers. Order took over 20 minutes for 2 kids meals. Go to another location!</text>

<pics>None</pics><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Would give negative stars if possible. This location is always disappointing. I dont know why i ever return here. There's always something wrong with my order, whether the food is cold, order is wrong, missing food, missing sauces, and even bagging it terribly. (Hashbrowns I ordered today were put in almost upside down.) Everyone here has the "I hate my job" attitude despite having to say "my pleasure." I've heard many horror stories from an ex-worker at this location. Food is always given out hours - even a day later after the throw out time has passed, no wonder the food tastes stale and old. Ex worker told me that an employee at the time had actually picked food out of the trash and gave it to the customer. Heard from the same person that they discriminate toward white people. Whatever stigma you hear about this location is probably true. I would be cautious going here and would recommend going to a different location or different food chain entirely. I will not be returning to this Carl's Jr. ever again.</Text></record>

<Text>I worked in fast food and if I acted the way this guy did I probably would have got in trouble, maybe that was just the type of supervisor I had i don't know..  Let me just say though, I am  not usually a fan of making a big deal about things but this guy was pretty rude. Took my order fairly well, when i rolled up to the window he takes my card and I immediately ask him if they have creamer cause I put it in my ice tea.. (Some people think that's weird) I happen to love it so whatever, anyways when he says they do I ask for the amount I always do at any place and he repeats the number in shock... like really dude? He wasn't being funny about it he totally was like being rude, he gave me my card and drink and I heard him mumble something to the other guy and he returns and says "Here's your creamer" in a flat, rude manner... I don't know, maybe I'm just being a baby or maybe you just had to be there but the whole vibe made me super uncomfortable. I mean uncomfortable enough to write this review.. I asked for a good handful but it shouldn't matter, I didn't ask for all of what they had in stock.. i probably won't go there again, seems like asking for a few things extra i.e katchup, napkins, creamer these days is too much for these cashier's..</Text>< Pics>

The manager there was too busy yelling at a employee then to take my order pretty much disrespected him in front of customers instead of just trying to help him out to have him understand how to work the register talk in Spanish to downgrade him even more I spect better from a manager</Review>

< Review>
We ordered two Jalapeno Double Cheeseburgers, neither of them were made with two patties and one of them was missing the jalapenos entirely and both had onions (that burger isn't supposed to come with onions). "How can someone be this stupid" you may ask, but this is not the case my friend. Stupid they may be, this mistake boils down to simply not caring whatsoever. They're lucky I was hungry and tired, if not I would have driven back down there and shoved their sorry excuse for a burger up someones a**.</Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>Worst Carl's Jr which is unfortunate because it is close to my house. I'll start with the 1 positive: the manager is nice. So many negative experiences. Once my 5yo kid bit into his burger only to find a jalapeño. The guy who handed me my food in the drive thru had such dirty hands it looked like he had just changed a tire. We ordered a burger "lettuce wrapped" and it came in a bun, not even extra lettuce and they would not change it for me because they said I was supposed to order it "low carb". The ketchup from the dispenser was so runny it was almost water, the employee very rudely told me "that's just how ketchup is". My order is wrong almost every time, if going drive thru I more often than not have to go inside for them to correct my order. Avoid this Carl's Jr!</Text>< date>

My husband gets back from work this morning after working graveyard shift, so I come home with his meal, he's about half way thru with his burger when he pulls a long hair out of his mouth. It was disgusting, Made me not want to finish my burger!and when I call the manager asks me what I want him to do. Thank God he offers a refund!!😤 next time I know to make sure before I leave the drive thru......< /text>

Tried the papusas with seafood filling. Tasted pretty good. Loved the fried plankton dish. Quick service. The decor needs updating< /review>

Best Tripas!
Good tripas are so hard to come by, and then i found El Palacio Del Sabor. Tripas at other places can be burned, stale, too chewy and soft, or they just dont seem like they were cleaned right.. yuck haha. But the tripas here (as long as you ask for them crispy and well done.. dont forget!) are BOMB.COM. A little greasy sometimes but the best I've come by in San Jose. The taste and flavor of the tripas are on point!  My personal favorite: Burrito with carne asada AND tripas mixed (crispy and well done).< /Text>

<Text>My coworkers and I have been craving pupusas for the past week and we finally came around to ordering some. We actually had a few places that we called but the price in bulk was just not reasonable. We ordered the pack of $10 + 1 for free for $38 and the service was fast! It was definitely worth it! The pupusas were delicious! 10/10 will come back here!<//Text>< Name>

Met up with a friend here based on their Popusas reviews. It did not disappoint. I had a revuelta and bean and cheese popusa. They were the best I have had in the South Bay. The place is a bit small but the cozy atmosphere is typical for an authentic Latino restaurant. They serve a variety of Latin American cuisine. I plan to return  and try out the many options. You should know that it's a cash only establishment and they don't serve alcohol.</Review>

<Text>Used to be good when it was Chalateco. Food has gone down in quality and the service is awful. Sat at a table 15 mins without anyone even greeting us. Like, actively ignoring us. We were the only table and they passed by us repeatedly and helped people with To go orders. Didn't even say hi, bring a menu, nothing.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>I love this Chalateco, the Salvadorian influence brings papusas to the menu along with the standard fare other Chalatecos have. The restaurant could be cleaner, but the staff is attentive and the prices are good.

I highly suggest the papusas with loroco, and the cola champagne.</text>< time>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Horchata well-off the one that sells here We told the worker that we did not like it and it was worth it. Pupusas have a very chewy cheese that almost drowns with it when one swallows it. I no longer return to this place. It was my first and my last time.

(Original)
Horchata bien desabrida la que vende aquí. Le dijimos a la trabajadora que no nos gustó y le valió. Las pupusas tienen un queso bien chicloso que casi se ahoga con el cuando uno se lo traga. Ya no regreso a este lugar.

<Text>Come here to load cash onto my Green Dot card because they're significantly cheaper than any other location that offers this service. The manager always has to come out to perform the task, but they're quick & efficient & very friendly about it. Not to mention all the treat & snacks I pick up while I'm there. We definitely love our trips to Dollar Tree!<//Text>< Pics>

That being said, I've seen better cared for stores of this type.

<gmap_id>0x80853d43f64a3de5:0x715dfdd3e7080786< /gmap_id><review>Would have rated this place higher however after spending about an hour or more shopping and with a full cart of $105.00 of items, I was denied use of the restroom when I needed to go and asked for the key. (They have two restrooms that used to be accessible up til recently.)  I was referred by the clerk to go use the nearest public restroom at the nearby Starbucks.  I was not only livid, but also highly embarrassed.  I clearly was spending over a hundred dollars in their dollar store but told to go to a business across the parking lot where I was spending no money and just to be able to relieve myself!  I'm sure Starbucks appreciates servicing all your restroom needs.  NOT COOL, DOLLAR STORE.  I probably won't be back.  I WAS YOUR CUSTOMER AND YOU EMBARRASS ME AND WANT ME TO GO TO ANOTHER BUSINESS WHEN I HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM BADLY ENOUGH TO ASK.  I didn't appear transient, or like I was going to abuse your facilities.    How about some courtesy for your paying customers?  Yea, I won't be back.  I'll spend my money where I'm treated better than that.  So very rude of you.< /review><user_name>Deborah P<//user_name>< resp>

<text>This store is great for a quick low price shop, there are alot of things that you can get that are pretty much the same as if you got it at a higher end store. Although there are some flops and be careful with the food, chips, candy and soft/energy drinks are good. Medicine is ok too if anything just a little less effective.< /text>< Pics>

Not enough cashiers and folks not social distancing in line, so I put my items back and walked out...I will shop the other dollar tree as they have at least 2 cashiers at all times.</Review>

The inside of the store is clean and organized and if you can't find what you want, they certainly can direct you to where it's at. Unfortunately I found this place after making purchases at a higher cost at different other shops around town. I definitely would recommend it!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I had bought a bunch of things from the Dollar tree for a kids event.  But we didn't end up using a few items.  So reading their policy, I went back to exchange it for something else since it was still new and not used.  They were really nice about it and allowed me to exchange it.  But once I got up to the register, I realized  I had grabbed the wrong receipt.  So there I was with a 5 year old and carrying my 2 year old with no receipt in hand to do this exchange.  Luckily for me, Claudia one of the store employees allowed me to do the exchange without a receipt.  She explained that she will allow it just this one time, which was all I needed.  It was a honest mistake on my part and she was just so amazingly nice about it.  I am truly grateful for her kindness.< /text>

But It looked more like they had a big wave of people come in to grab all the Christmas stuff.. they did have some good stuff, got all the decorations -matching to- for about 4 dollars. Way better then buying a big set somewhere eles for 15-20 dollars!< /Review>< Pics>

This dollar store is like any other. They have a section for decorations, gift wrapping, kids toys, cleaning, toiletries, freezer section, pantry foods and kitchen utensils. They seem to be fairly clean. We usually buy decorations here and they work fairly well. The only draw back is that they often have long lines.< /review>

Put in a balloon order for my daughter's 2nd birthday the week before.  When we got there the morning of my daughter's birthday our order wasn't there.  The woman at the register went to ask another lady about our order.  The lady shouted at us from that they had the order but they were out of helium.  I asked both women why no one called to notify us so we could have made other arrangements.  Neither offered me an answer let alone any type of apology at all.

I stated how sad that a little girl wasn't going to have balloons for her second birthday, the woman just looked at me and shrugged her shoulders.  Some sort of apology no matter how insincere would have been appreciated, but no one here seemed to care in the least.  Fortunate for us the other dollar store across the way had balloons on hand and the woman working there helped us so quickly and nicely so that our little girl had some sort of decoration for her party.

From now on I will stay away from the dollar tree and take my business to the other store across the street.< /Text>

<Review>There is a heavy set lady with brown hair and ponytail, she works in Lane 1. Visited today 2/28/18. So glad I didnt go to her lane, she had a terrible attitude to her customers and others because her light wasnt on she was being crass to the people like that her light wasnt on they shouldnt have gone in her line. MIND YOU EVERYTIME WE GO THERE, THERE IS ONLY ONE REGISTER OPEN AND LONGGGG LINES. I was angry for the people she had attitude with. Lady GO EAT YOUR SANDWICH AND STRAIGHTEN UP OR THEY NEED TO FIRE YOU!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80853d43f64a3de5:0x715dfdd3e7080786</Gmap_id><username>Jennifer Aguilar< /username><Response>None< /Response><user_id>104364876099055478587</user_id><date>1519849172152< /date></record>

Tends to be well used and slightly disorganized but generally a well stocked and friendly Dollar Tree.</Text>

<Time>1508264120081< /Time><rating>1</rating><Review>I went through the drive thru on Sunday night around 6-7 to get the 12 piece leg & thigh family meal. They told me that they only had legs, they were all out for the day. When I got home we noticed it was a mix of legs, thighs, and wings. They gave me 4 wings, 4 legs and it seems like they cut 2 thighs in half to make 4 to complete our order. The worst part wasn't even that. I took two pieces of chicken for lunch and when I was eating the wing I noticed it was a little pink. I started to check the wing and sure enough it was raw. Blood was coming out. idk if there was more like that but I was too late because my husband had already ate his lunch. So if we get sick, we already know why. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>it gets busy at lunch time but if u can come before the lunch and you will be fine. The food is good and ive never had any issues with their staff. If you are looking for something sort of healthy compared to buying a burger and fries and dont want to spend too much money, their $5 combos are the best<//Text>< pictures>

<review>I like this spot! They provide superb meals, they have a rich menu, The chef in that place is a real authority in the kitchen, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The food is consistently of high class, the service towards the guests  is agreeable. I often eat in this place and I was never unsatisfied. Highly recommended.</review>< Pics>

I had to proceed through drive thru (Covid-19 choice) which had a long line. Two really good things happened that day. The line moved surprisingly fast, our order was correct and we saved with a coupon. That was #1. We took it home to eat and that's where #2 occurred.  The chicken was hot and juicy, but it was the FLAVOR that stood out to me. Kudos. I'll be going back very soon.</Text>< pics>

Within the last month it seems like they hired a bunch of new people who weren't trained correctly. They are friendly , but my Double chicken avocado fit bowl has been missing the cauliflower rice, and is not seasoned. 2 times in a row. I've gotten a bowl with just lettuce, chicken and avocado - bland with no seasoning and missing ingredients.
Really disappointed because I used to love this location. Now I don't feel the same</text>

I order a double protein fit bowl it seems like I only got a 1/4 of the protein and when they ask what sauce or salsa you would like. Me very specific 3 green salsas, 2 jalapeño sauce, and no dressing. I didn't get the green sauce but got 8 packages of jalapeño sauce, 2 Pico de Gallo, and dressing. No happy!</text>

If I could give it no stars, I would. Horrible customer service. They gave me attitude when I came in to complain about my order that they got wrong. With the prices we pay, we should at least get what we order.</review>

Tasty food but you always have to ask for double chicken...join the Loco reward and you get a free bowl with a single purchase of anything - we opted for chips.<//Review>

<review>Their parking lot actually extends up and around the back of their building. This store's location is set on a very busy part of a very busy street.

I have been a customer of this location for over 10 years. I've checked them on small mistakes, and they have improved - over and over again. The last few times I went in to this Pollo Loco location, I had nothing but a GREAT experience!

Staff was outstanding! Food order delivery time is amazingly quick! Their menu always has new items along with the  standard plates and deals. Their chicken, their salsas and salsa bar are top shelf! Come inside the store to enjoy their salsa bar.

As wretched as many parts of San Bernardino may be, this restaurant maintains its dignity and deserves respect! Great food, outstanding and fast service, clean, quiet eating area, clean restrooms, and decent prices.

Me: Two thumbs up! My Chihuahuas: Four paws up!</review>< Pics>

<Text>This place is good. It was busy one night and they missed a item on my order. Stephanie was handling this issue and had it taken care of. First off it wasn't that bad, simple mistake, late busy and understandable for it to happen. She replaced the order and we were on our way. This place is clean and safe. One of my favorites and stays on my top five! Thank you guys again!😊< /Text>< Time>

The staff always seems unorganized and the restaurant itself was dirty. There was trash on the floor and the tables hadn't been wiped down. The only reason it's gets this rating is because it wasn't clean. Who I thought was the manager didn't even seem to be concerned with the presentation of the restaurant or how bad it looked, said goodbye and went home. Someone needs to get this place cleaned up. I only go there because it's on the way home but I might have to find another Pollo Loco.<//Review>< pics>

Food is good. Very good cook. Employee at the register was rude and un-interested in customer service.

Nice clean restaurant, fast service the only thing I didn't like is that I asked the cashier if I could switch two of the drumsticks that came in my family meal for thighs but the man on the grill refuse to do so.

Love their food and GREAT service too! However I'm deducting 1 star since all the salsa and hot sauce was gone. They did refill them after being asked but it was a slight  inconvenience. And I overheard the customer ahead of us tell them she wanted different chicken because it was  burnt.... ours was delicious.</Review>

El pollo loco has tasty chicken. The cashier was very helpful when i was ordering. Unfortunately, i had to take one star off due to only receiving 5/6 sides for my 2 orders of mixed 16 pieces meal.

Update 6/17 : i had to dock off an additional star due to a few of my tortillas missing. I only got three flour tortillas, no corn ones in the bag. In addition, they almost forgot one of my sides until i told a worker. Be very careful with your orders, double check your bags before leaving.<//Text>

<Review>Food is great. can't complain.  But they seemed to be a little under staffed, takes a bit to have you're order taken.

I at least go twice a week and I don't mind waiting because it's not a regular fast food it's more of a wine and dine.  The flavors are so delicious and the customer service is excellent.</Text>

<Date>1459024841329< /Date><review>ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOU WILL ALMOST ALWAYS END UP MISSING HALF OFF YOUR ORDER OR GET OLD AND OVERCOOKED DRIED CHICKEN! The costumer service here is terrible! The chicken here is ALWAYS dry even if you ask for your chicken juicy they will give it to you overcooked and dried the one that has been sitting there on the grill for hours. The mananger (MARIA) here is not friendly she is always in a bad mood. This pollo loco (next to autozone) really sucks I really tried giving it a few chances since it's the closest one by my house but it never gets better only worse and that is why I always go to the one on kendall ave all the employees are very friendly including the manangers and I always get my chicken how I like it it doesn't matter if it's through the drive thru or inside.</review>< Pics>

I think this location on Highland needs assistance. It's noon on a Sunday and you're telling customers in the drive thru that it's going to be a TEN MINUTE wait for chicken. Unacceptable.< /review>

They close at 10, we got there 10 minutes prior to closing time and they would NOT take our order. You can not turn down business before closing time. That's just ridiculous! You forced me to take my business next door to McDonald's<//text>
