First let me say this we had Stanley Steamer out to clean our carpets and they did a terrible job, we have been using them for at least 20 years for rentals and our house and this time they didn't even clean the carpet.  Our carpet is two years old and we have just gotten a new puppy that we had to potty train so there were several pet stains, we were clear with green carpet what was up with our carpet and the Stanley steamer angle.  They of course told us Stanley steamer was the worst and I had to agree.

The day of the cleaning Donovan shows up in an unmarked personal van with the steam cleaner, he cleaned our carpet and did a much better job than Stanley Steamer did and charged us $350 for 3 rooms, kinda pricey but ok.  Donovan told us no problem he would make us happy with the carpet, when the carpet dried  several spots came back, as clean as the carpet was we felt that maybe these just didn't get hit with the pre treatment,  This is where the problems start, we contacted back the company to get this taken care of, they became un helpful and asked for $150 dollars more to come back out.  I was like what happened to making us happy?  When I said I was not going to pay an additional $150 for the carpet to get touched up Green carpet essentially stopped replying to my text's.  Of course they have cashed the check by then.

I wanted to give them a good review but when I started dealing with them after the fact I became suspicious of the way they are running this business, I believe they are just contracting the work out so you have no way of getting them back and when you look at there page there clearly is no satisfaction guarantee, and they don't follow the procedure that they layout as what they do.  I also noticed that some of the reviews seem to be questionable and are posted by the same names that sent out my receipt.

Buyer beware, I can not recommend you to do business with this company because I don't think they care if your carpet cleaning is to your satisfaction.  I imagine they will post a reply to this negative review but oh well seems there are others that have had this experience.

(edit)

Within 5 mins of posting this review I received this text from  Paida Ndemera the person I have been in contact with trying to work this out.

"Hi. Thank you for the review. I’ll assume there is no longer mileage in trying to rectify this issue"

she has not responded to my text since this text and hadn't responded for 3 days to the previous texts, never had a company refuse to work something out because you posted a negative review.  Just another reason to not use these guys in my opinion.

I would like to clarify that at booking you were informed that to deep clean your space the cost would be $150. You were also informed that there would be a slight increase to the price of the carpets were stained. When the technician came over it was clear that there was a stain on your carpet that had possibly been there for months if not years. The technician cleaned the space as agreed but was unable to get rid of the long standing stain. As agreed the final price should have been $150 as the whole space was deep cleaned and several futile  attempts made to get rid of the permanent stain. We definitely were not going to charge you extra for stain removal as clearly we were not able to remove the stain. You then offered to pay $100. I share this narrative to give other clients a full picture of what transpired.'}< /Response><Text>They didn’t remove any of the stains and I had to pay my landlord 250 after paying these ppl $100 for not even removing 1 stain.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

The cream area rug in my sons room needed a deep clean asap as he had thrown up on it, eek! Green Carpet SF was super responsive, professional and acted quickly. We worked with James who was very personable, friendly and professional. He walked us through the different options available and provided his recommendation to get the best results which was to use their offsite facility. ALL of the stains came out of the rug and it was as good as new. We also got the rug back in less than a week and appreciated the fast turn around time.  We would 100% work with them again; James especially, as he was super personable, kind and passionate about his work; excellent customer service!</text>

James was the man. He offered to have our appointment early, showed up on time and answered my calls and texts. He went through all the trouble of driving his van into the cramped garage, bringing his equipment and tools up to my building’s floor, he taught me how the carpet cleaning process works and left my carpet spotless. I’m stoked to live in my clean new condo. Thank you Green Carpet and James!< /text>

This was also stated in the work order that was provided.\nYou were also informed that the cleaning time would be longer given the carpet condition.\nUnder those circumstances the job that was performed was best possible with high end solutions that are non-toxic with professional equipment.\nJames  also performed a second cleaning and confirmed your satisfaction with results by signing the work order.\nWe are sorry you are not fully satisfied.'}< /response>

The cost and estimate:  I called for a quote to see if the service was something that was in my price range.  I talked to the guy and he quoted around $200 for the job. It was for around 500sf of carpet cleaning.  He mentioned that price was for the lowest service, but when the guy arrives I should ask him and he might give me a deal for the more expensive service.  He said "maybe $270". I agreed.  When the guy arrives he's telling me around $400. I said that was way above my limit so he came down to, I believe, $320.  He promised me it would be great, he uses all natural cleansers, and I would love the service and results. At that time I mentioned that I didn't like I didn't like that the cost was so much higher but the fact was, I wanted my carpets cleaned and the guy was there and ready to do the job. I just went with it.

The results: Cut to the carpets are now cleaned.  Do they look better, yes. Are they what I expected, no. I fully realize the carpets where dirty and definitely not ever going to be perfect  but the result I got was nothing better than what I get when I rent the Rug Dr at Safeway for $30. I told him I was moderately pleased and he had a lot of reasons why he couldn't get it to a better standard but all I saw was $320 wasted.  I have cleaned my carpets with the rented machine multiple times (and was very happy for the $30 I spent) so I guess I expected the results from a professional services to be so much better.  That weren't.

To top it off when he leaving I asked how I should pay, he said "Vemno"  and that I "could tip there if I wanted".  I didn't know that tipping was a thing that you did for a professional service like this but I did anyway.

Bottom line:  I spent $350 for a service that did no better than I have done myself for $30 using a rented carpet cleaner from the grocery store.

Maybe my expectations were too high but I will never use this service again.  Just not what I expected.< /Text>

Everything looked fine until the day of service, James arrived an hour late, invented excuses to raise the price agreed on the service to triple the initial budget and provided a poor quality service; He claimed some stains wouldn’t go out and I was able to do it myself the following day with normal cleaning products.

They did my 5 bedroom house with lots of care and 90% of my dog stains are out!!!
Also paid for odor removal and the one they used just removes odor and not putting a fake smel I loved that!  I am going to be using this company as my regular carpet cleaning now.</text>

Mike performed miracles on our carpets! We were trying to sell our home and we were forced to replace our carpet‘s because none of the large carpet cleaning companies to get out the stains. This was disappointing beyond belief. We saw rave reviews on next door but felt reluctant, after speaking to Mike he explained the process and he gave us a gurantee...we went with it. Our realtor was shocked and we were overwhelmed with gratefulness. Watching him cleaning products and his procedures we just knew we had a true professional. You saved us thousands of dollars Mike, my wife and I can’t be more happy 😊, thank you!< /text>

<Review>Mike and James came right on time, and spent two and a half hours dealing with a carpet that had significant, multiple stains contributed by a young child, a dog and who knows what else. When they departed, they left a beautiful, odorless carpet behind. I couldn't have been more satisfied< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>We had very dirty carpet that needed serious cleaning. James was very professional and courteous. He explained to us what he will be doing and the results that we can expect. We couldn't be happier! James spent the time to do a very thorough cleaning and made the carpet look almost new. We also appreciated the respect that he had for our home and the care he took when working around the furniture. Thank you for a great job and a very reasonable price!<//Text>< Date>

I had a few stains on my queen bed. I had 2 minor stains and 1 bad stain of chocolate milk. They did they work and got ever spot cleaned and the stains are totally gone. They also were on time and only took the time they quoted to do the work. My bed even dried faster then expected. I will return first a carpet clean or any other service they do and I will recommended them to any of my family or friends. I for hot to mention that they really do use Green cleaning product and I did not have any kind of chemical smell left in my mattress that made me even more happier.<//Text>

I received a quote in a reasonable amount of time.  They communicated with me prior to the appointment and after the appointment.  The technician arrived on time and explained everything that would happen.  I had some difficult stains and had the option of paying a small amount extra to have them specially worked on.  The work was done in a professional manner and the technician was clean and polite.  Options at the end were to pay in cash, by Venmo or by credit card, which carried a 3% extra charge, so I used Venmo.  The technician was not able to accept a check.  This should be made clear at the time of booking.<//review>

Another great Touchstone gym. Love how big this place is! Bouldering, top, lead and workout areas. It can be a bit chilly in the winter so wear a hoodie to warm up. And there is actually parking unlike at mission cliffs.</Text>

Great team working there.  The gym is absolutely stunning.  Big lead section, awesome bouldering, workout areas and more.  It's got everything you want in a climbing gym.  And a sauna.  Can't forget about the sauna.< /Review>

Nice, clean and spacious bouldering gym but pricier than others , I usually go to a different one in Sacramento that's about 30% percent cheaper . I do like going here a couple times a month just to change it up, would make this my primary location if prices are reduced</text>

Dogs no longer allowed. Planned my day around climbing here since I'm in the area for the week and it's the closest touchstone gym, but I needed to be able to bring my dog to make it work. Showed up thinking I'd be able to tie him up while I work out (did it in the past) but that is no longer allowed here. Management, please be aware that a no-dogs-at-all policy may satisfy those few folks who do not like dogs, but it basically means your gym is no longer an option for folks who need to keep their dogs with them on these hot days.</review>

City of Sacramento: 1 star
Pipeworks: probably 5 stars

I'm from out of state and would have liked to climb here but got scared off by the sea of homeless surrounding it. Will forever avoid Sacramento...</text>

Love this gym! 40 ft lead and top rope routes, full weight/cardio area, yoga, CrossFit and one of the best bouldering areas I've ever seen! They have it all, in a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere with a great staff. Recommend this place to everyone in the Sacramento area</Review>

<Text>Our family has been coming to PipeWorks since 01/17. We initially got passes because two of the kids that we adopted had add/ptsd, and with the guidance of their therapist we decided that bouldering/climbing would train their sensibilities to focus and remain calm in challenging situations. Needless to say we have been completely taken back by the progress of our kids, as well as how kid-friendly this gym is. Vaugh Medford and his staff, along with the members of the gym have been nice, warm, patient, and kind to us and our kiddos. We can't say enough nice things about this place.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>Came with a group of people from work, so we got to share and try different dishes. Loved everything! The salad with nopales (cactus), various greens, heirloom tomatoes and pumpkin seeds had a very good dressing, and everything tasted fresh. I've oredered their soup, caldo tlalapeno (sp?), which was hearty and full of chunky veggies, rice, lots of chicken, and had a generous slice of avocado.  It also had two dried chiles that I've fished out since I can't do very spicy, but the soup still had a good kick to it thanks to chile flakes and whatever else they put in the to spice it up. Their tacos with deep fried squash were a hit as well, and were a vegetarian version of the fish tacos (those came with deep fried cod).  Everything was fresh and the flavors and presentation made for an enjoyable meal.

Located on mission and 16th. I ordered a churro and a carne asada super burrito. And when you check in there on yelp you get $2 off a super burrito.  The salsa bar is top notch with a variety of spiciness levels and unique flavors. I enjoyed the churro while I waited for my meal. It was cinnamon crunchy delight. The super burrito was tasty. Overall good food and great service.< /Text>

Great scrap yard! This is the best place to go for cashing in on any scrap metal you have. When you pull up to the yard there is a worker outside to help you navigate your way , instead of wandering around aimlessly like other yards I’ve been to. As for prices paid , I couldn’t find a better paying yard , and believe me I’ve looked. It’s such a great place for recycling I drive a little over an hour to come to Ranch Town Recycling. Can’t say enough good things about this place the workers are great the owner is great. I’ll absolutely be a returning .< /Text>

I have been going here for years. Stopped for a while when we were allowed the park inside because the men directing parking lot were rude and belligerent.   They would scream at people for no reason, which I don't tolerate at all.  Today 5/26 a woman was directing the traffic. She was proactive, came to my car, took my bag of aluminum cans and took them inside.  I am so grateful.

Owners have always been so kind and friendly too always going the extra mile for their customers.</Review>

Fast and simple. Weekdays are the best days to go. They buy plastic, aluminum cans, copper and other metals. You park on the street. Only if you have a truck load you are able to park inside.< /Review>

<Review>We really appreciate how the reorganized how the bottle drop off works - it is now in one big area! Everybody was very helpful, and now the use of customer numbers will make the transaction process more convenient. With all our bottles, cans, and glass sorted ahead of time, we were there in and out 10-15 minutes. Very good experience!!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< name>

Not sure if there has been a change in management but now they the streamlined, and it is a quick in and out. The only gripe I have is parking, it parallel street parking and you may have a wait a minute or two get one. There are trolleys to carry your stuff. I give it a thumbs up👍🏽</text>< pictures>

Nice people. Cleared facility. Well organized. Fast service. 2PM afternoon on a Saturday was ideal. Parking is limited but employees are eager help you unload your car and regulate the lines. Got in and out in less than 10 mins (4 large bags of plastic and 2 large bags of cans).</text>

<text>First time visiting today. The whole process was initially confusing. I parked about 15 car-lengths away under the overpass and walked down to ask for information. Although it appeared to be a free-for-all, the woman at the front gate was very courteous and helpful. She offered to walk to my car and help me with my 3 bags of plastic; on the way she was saying hi to returning customers and directing other people. She got me into the correct line and it moved quickly. The attendant came and took my bags to the scale and within 2 minutes handed me the weight ticket. The pay window went very quickly and I was out of there in no time at all! This is an EXCELLENT place and even though I live 23 miles away, I will return for all my recycling needs!!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808fcb54af78a72f:0xebad0409930b74da<//gmapID></record>

<date>1608520573462<//date><rating>4< /rating><Text>This is where I had always went for recycling since 2010...... then they all of a sudden were only taking certain recyclables i.e.(metal, copper, etc.) Which sucks because they truly are one of the highest paying centers as well as quick, open the latest, & majority of the time  nice people! So for while I had to go to other locations. I finally saw they had reopened & were accepting all recyclables! When I went I could see the reason.......... they completely revamped there property to make it more efficient and productive for themselves & their customers!! SO I COMMEND THEM ON THE CHANGE! Also they're truly a good hearted family owned business whom are all there majority of the time. Even so 2 wks ago I wasn't able to take myself and  had a friend helping me............... by the time they made it to me and we filled the truck full it was late and all the closer centers were closed and they were going to close in 15 min., so I decided to call and ask if they could stay open15 extra min.! He said yes as long as all was separated  (it was)! He stated he look for our vehicle which he did we got help and paid out! So TY RanchTown for helping as always!< /Text>< pictures>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Ranchtowm recycling is, simply, the best! I have been going to this family owned center since it first opened.  The owners are beyond helpful! They have done an incredible job in training their staff. In my opinion, I believe they've incorporated a "Common Courtesy" service style, and this my friends, is what's missing with many of today's establishments.

The staff even greets you on the street to help carry bags. I would like to mention MARY JANE, who was a lifesaver in assisting me with my overstuffed bags. She was ourteous,  kind and genuine.

In fact.....................

Thanks again.</text>< time>

I have been going to Ranch Town Recycling Center for over 10 years, Great Service! Friendly service and the employees always help me navigate where to park even help bring up my recycling to the scale.  the scale is sight for you to see.  Five Stars!   I tried another recycling center in Santa Clara one time as they offered more money for recycling, very bad experience, they took my recycling in a back room came out with a ticket I had no idea if they even weighed my recycling correctly.  So I went back to Ranch Town Recycling Center because they have nothing to hide weigh it right in front of you.  I told the gentleman that runs the place he reassured me he would match the price of his competitors.  He has my 100% respect!  I will always go back to him!  Hands down the Very Best!</Review>

I’ve been going to ranch town for many years. The workers are always very cheerful and happy to help you navigate Into parking spots. I started to get my bags out and one of the workers came over to help me bring in my bags, asking if that was all, I told him no I had a few more, he comes back a few minutes later and brought me a cart to help me take it all in. He helped me in pushing the cart and got me situated, cans here, plastic here and glass bottles there. I waited less than 10 minutes for weigh in and the cashier. I walked out feeling like a million bucks! Proud to have done a good thing for the environment and happy with what I received for turning in my recycling. Things go very smoothly if you organize your cans, plastic and glass ahead of time. Definitely will be back!</text>

Good place to bring your empty plastic bottles, glass bottles and cans. The staff very helpful. I wouldn't recommend to bring small children,  a lot going on with fork lifts.<//Text>

Just left Ranch Town and was very pleased with the new setup. The new rules make it so easy and much safer to come and recycle your glass, plastic or cans. Park on the street outside the lot (don’t worry this is very easy and safe) walk up the sidewalk onto the lot where Tom greeted us to explain the new system. We grabbed a flat cart and rolled it back to my car where we unloaded our bags of recyclables. MAKE SURE TO SORT YOUR RECYCLABLES BEFORE YOU GO! This makes it fast and easy to unload onto the cart,  roll your stuff onto the lot and then stand in one of the three separate lines. (Plastic, glass or Cans). Grab your tickets (one for each of the different recyclables) with the weights of your stuff and then get into the “payout” line. The whole thing took about 15 minutes from  start to finish. I personally had 32 lbs of cans and 67 lbs of plastic for about $138!  We spoke to Solomon, one of the owners, on our way out to express our satisfaction of the new setup. It’s a family owned operation and they make it fast and easy and the  employees are very helpful. We will always come back here!<//text>

Went here last year it was easy to drop off recycle. Now they have reworked the lot. PARK ON STREET. Then go in and get a cart. Look at employees standing there and looking at you. NO HELP HERE.  Push recycle in and be ask cans or plastic. Go to the correct area. IF You use there trash cans be prepared to return them to the place you grabbed them and or get YELLED at by the heavy set lady. Very rude person all around. She need to learn how to deal with people. May be have carts at entrance and have a sign please use.< /Review>

We visited Ranch Town recycling center for the first time this past weekend since all of the parking lot recycling places seem to have closed down.  They do take aluminum cans, plastic bottles, etc. but you have to park on the street and carry your recyclables in - this is probably a good thing since there's a lot going on in the yard!  The owner was helpful and courteous - mentioned that they have had to restructure their business to better accommodate customers like me who are just recycling a few bags of cans.  Wait time was minimal - pay was good - will be going back in the future.<//Text>

Service was pretty good. The operation can be a little confusing at first but they have people at the gate who's job is to help you unload and direct you on where to go. I got a spot right at the entrance but I expect that won't always be the case.< /text>

Went today for the first time since they reopened with the recycling for the school. I go 5-10 times a year and they are always helpful. Was very impressed today with the cleanliness of the place. Had to get used to the new layout, but a friendly lady saw what I had and kept waving me in the right direction. In and out in 20 minutes. Of course, we have our cans and plastic all sorted ahead of time, so it's a breeze. I've always had good service in the past, and today it just seemed like they had stepped it up a notch.<//review>

<user>110308020648846732319</user><Review>THANK GOD THEY'RE BACK!
I wasn't sure if it was going to be permanent or not but glad they're taking cans, plastics, and glass again. Only other places I could find were like some guys in a truck outside of one of the Safeways with garbage cans covered in roaches.
This is by far the best place I've found and I am very glad to be able to come here again.<//Review>< Name>

<text>I love this place I take my cans and I am in and out in 15 minutes or less.

The entire staff is awesome!  Keep in mind these men getting dirty all day flinging stuff you bring to the right area. It's loud they aren't yelling at you they seriously have a hard time hearing with recycling machines going in the background. Parking can be tricky but pay attention the staff will get you a parking space! Just listen and when they tell you to go, GO!

They are trying to get you in and out pay attention and be patient and it will be fine.

Some people say the workers look like "thugs", they work with your garbage all day did you expect them to greet you with a tuxedo? They just haul your garbage to recycle it don't be so judgmental.

I am a woman I take my nephews to recycle stuff and never feel uncomfortable either. Very respectful staff.

Keep up the good work guys! See ya tomorrow!</text>< userid>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>They have good rates for cans, PET bottles, etc... Solomon has gone out of his way to provide exceptional service. They have a new system in place which if you have cans, bottles, and plastic you have to park on the street; whereas, if you have copper wire, etc... you can park inside of their facility.

This systems allows for more expedited service and less traffic. The key here is to have your cans, bottles, and plastic sorted out prior to getting to  Town's Recycling center.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>They're pretty organized considering what they their dealing with.  Typically I'm able to get in and out in around 5-8 minutes.

If there's a hold up, it's usually the fault of the other patrons (not sorting their bags, getting in the wrong line, having dozens of bags, etc).  Really, those weird and inconsiderate patrons are my only complaint.  No one wants to wait in a line with one bag of aluminum cans while some weirdo with 10 or more bags holds up everyone else.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

This place used to be great,  seems like lately they don't care. Also, I called and asked what the price was for steel was per lb. (Its listed on the website for metals they purchased) and the guy tells me, No, I don't buy steel there's no money in it, haven't bought steel in years, even though I just recycled about 1 ton of steel there about 8 months ago.<//Review>

<Review>We were shooed away with no explanation or information . Rude and unhelpful. We are human after all

Made a phone call to the owner and was told to park on the street and walk in. Or, if you have a lot of glass to ask the staff to let you in. Once inside things go smoothly.</Review><UserId.>108354700036038763358<//UserId.><rating>4< /rating>< date>

It was super busy and packed when I got there. There were no parking spaces, so a couple of the employees (and I think the manager) helped direct me to a spot off to the side. They were very efficient in helping me & my sister get our recycling taken care of.
When I told the guy who I believe is the manager that it was our first time going there, he was extremely helpful in pointing us in the right direction and making sure there were people helping us right away.
I would definitely recommend going there and I'll definitely give them business again in the future.< /review>

Let me say that today was the best customer service I've ever received from any place...EVER. I had my infant son with me and Larry came up to greet me. Larry is an African-American GENTLEMAN. His demeanor was very pleasant, helpful, and knowledgeable. He saw that I had 2 bags of plastic bottles and my son in the rear car seat. He asked if I would like to just stay with my son while he got my bags to the scale and get all my paperwork done. He asked if I had been there before, which I had, and all I had to provide was my name. He took cafe of processing my bags and recyclables and I never left my son!!! Got my cash, thanked Larry very much, and was in/out in a matter of minutes. I'll tell you this, no one has ever been more thoughtful. I was able to speak with Solomon (owner?/manager?) and told him that Larry is awesome! I do hope Larry gets recognition and high praise because you can tell he treats customers with respect and utmost professionalism every day. What he did today wasn't the first time...it was very natural and really surprised me in the best possible way. It is very comforting to know there are still quality and caring employees and people out there. Thank you, thank you, thank you again Larry!!   Go to Ranch Town Recycling...BECAUSE THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU AND THE ENVIRONMENT!!!< /text>

Thanks for the update.  I look forward to using your reopened services soon. Then I can update stars accordingly.
Went here to return CRV items (as the truck at Branham and Meridian is MIA). They are no longer accepting CRV. You will have to go elsewhere. We were able to drop off a small box of scrap metal. They should update their website.< /review>

<Text>the manager is very friendly and professional.  I always take my scrap wire here, they give the best service and do what they can when buying back my wire as far as fair pricing.  I never leave thinking I'm getting ripped off.  highly recommend this place. also, they do a real good job at keeping the place clean and organized, being a recycling center.<//Text>< pics>

Showed up before 5:30 pm today only to be turned away. "We no longer take CRV items here..." Never was my favorite place to visit. Can't understand why any recycling place would choose to not take CRV, it kind of goes with that type of business. Been there about 5 times before and never heard anything about this change until it was too late. Not the end of the world...< /Text>

This place gets super busy, so its best to go early on Monday thru thurs, other than that, this is by far the best place to turn in your recycling. The men and women who work there are hella hard working and super helpful. The owner and his wife who work there every day remember me by name, which is saying a lot considering how rarely I go and how many people they see day to day.<//text>

<text>I have been going to this Recycling Center for 2yrs now and my experience has been wonderful!!  They are there to help carry your bags or containers when they see you walking up the parking lot. All of the workers are very respectful and that means a lot to me since I'm a woman!   Keep up your great customer service!!!  Connie Thomas</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< Review>
Terrible customer service by older lady at cashier and the older man who appears to be the owner or manager. They were both horrible, barely made eye contact, and were dismissive in helping me whatsoever. It’s okay if you don’t like white people, y’all, but don’t discriminate and ignore them. That’s racist.<//Review>

Best recycle experience EVER! I will not go back to the little places at Safeway. Fair prices. Super (not high) nice employees. Owner greeted me when he heard id never been there. Crazy fast.</text>

Such a great customer service for something as straightforward as selling plastic bottles! Right from the time you enter, empty your plastic bottles and finally get paid for them, it is an amazing experience interacting with these folks. The manager was very helpful and friendly, gave us tips on selling bottles by count vs weight for large and small bottles. These guys are really motivated to providing the highest value.< /Text>

Went there about a month ago. Being fairly new to the area, we decided to come based on the other positive reviews. The place didn't disappoint: we pulled in, I looked around since I had no idea of where to take things, and the owner/manager noticed me immediately and came over to offer help. The employees helped us unload and sort things out. Even with two car loads of items for redemption, it was all very quick and painless thanks to their excellent service.< /Text>

I absolutely love Ranch Town Recycling! I've been going there for years. Solomon is wonderful and if he's not helping unload my stuff himself, he is quick to get one of the other guys to help me. The guys are always friendly and willing to help out, even when I have a smaller amount of recycling than usual. Thanks guys, you're great!< /text>

< review>
As i waited to be able to drive in before i even pulled into a spot an old man asked me what do you have ? So i stopped and told him and he said no i have garbage, let's see and i kind of pulled out a bag on top but he had reached in and grabbed a cable and said you have garbage go to green mosher down street to donate bye! You don't have anything but garbage we are not garbage for you! He didn't even bother to look at or cared to see anything he assumed. I did however take my stuff to norms and was paid 65 us dollars so maybe it was due to my old car or maybe because i am asian. I don't know as the man looked to be of asian Indian but sometimes i am wrong i don't know why but he was rude and wasted my time! I brought expensive items as i had to buy them for update electric work so the Cooper grounded pipes alone were 40 granted i had two the least still got me something somewhere else. To go to Willow Glen area ish was waste of my gas !</review>

Small, but highly organized. The extremely helpful crew gave me top notch service; I was looking for some pallets for a backyard art project and before I knew it 2 were found, and loaded into my car. Even more amazing as it was a busy Saturday afternoon and things didn't stop moving all around me. Thanks for a great service to the community!< /text>

<Review>The owner(or manager) Solomon is very friendly and helpful. They have the best prices in the area but make sure to sort ahead of time because it gets busy. I am an electrician who frequently recycles copper and I must say I was impressed with the service and prices at Ranch Town, I will defiantly be back.</Review>< pics>

Saul and his crew are the BEST!!!  I called first to find out if I had to remove all the bottle caps like you have to in Mountain View Recycling. (It is so time consuming and HOT! I hate going there. I wasn't treated very kindly either) So I called Ranch Town Recycling Center.  After speaking with Saul for a few minutes on the phone I knew this was where I wanted to go.

Saul is honest to his word! When I got there Saul and his crew greeted me with smiles, were very nice and friendly. They work very hard and fast but along they way they are very helpful answering questions and providing helpful information.  I was so surprised I actually was treated with respect and consideration. I was not treated like a number or just one of the herd. Saul and his team made it so easy. I feel going a little further was soo soo worth it. Best experience, best treatment, best people ever at a recycling center.
Thank you Saul and everyone at Ranch Town from Rose and Arlie<//Text>

This is where i go, a contractor, it does get busy and chaotic on the weekends, but that is the only time i can go, they are open 7 days a week. I think they do a great job. My kids separate our cans and bottles, to earn a little cash and learn a little about recycling. Money from this bought them a 3d printer and has been funding filament.<//review>

Had an old, disgusting fridge from our garage. Was quoted $100 from someone to come pick it up for us. Found these guys on line and put the fridge in the back of our SUV and dropped it off for $10. What a deal. Gave them $20, I was so grateful for a place to get rid of this thing. They even helped us unload it. it was awesome.</Text>

I had a couple bottles to recycle and had so much fun at my last recycling experience in Seven Trees that I wanted to try it again!  It had been so much time since my last adventure that I forgot what a complete waste of time this actually is.  For me, at least, however if you dedicate your time to picking up this stuff and have more than a few bottles, this might be worth it.  But even then I'm not really sure.  The time it takes to get out here and wait in various lines vs the convenience of just putting it out on the curb... well you can decide for yourself.

This place has different lines for the different kinds of material, but there are no instructions.  i'm sure the other patrons were laughing at the white girl doing recycling wrong.

For those thinking that I had a bad experience, you are sorely wrong.  I enjoyed finally getting it right, the employees that I talked to were all very friendly, and the wait was much shorter than my experience at the Seven Trees place.  I can't comment on the dollar value as I really don't care about the difference in a few cents for my few bottles.  Also - this place is outdoor.  You will appreciate that after having to wait in a long line in an un-airconditioned warehouse with a bunch of trash.< /text>

From the moment I pull my car into the driveway at Ranchtown recycling until the time when I'm ready to head back onto Lincoln Ave. to go on with my day, there is always someone right there ready to help.  The funny thing is, they always make me feel like I'm the only one they are there to help.  One of the "guys" directs me to the next parking place and by the time I'm unlocking the back, someone else is heading my way asking if I need any bins for bottles. They bring the tubs, we fill 'em up, and then together we make one long pull over to the scale.  Sure I can do it on my own, but it's faster to have help and adds a little conversation to my day. I have been taking our family's recycling there for 15 + years and I can't remember ever running into someone with a bad attitude.  They have always answered my questions and have helped me locate anything I need.  A+ service, organization and attitude. Thanks for lots of smiles (and cash).<//text>

There is always someone to help you to a parking spot and unload your car if needed.  They have longer hours and are open 7 days/week which no other recycling center can match. Highly recommend Ranchtown for all your recycling.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Staff is rude and unprofessional, staff member at every station I visited was constantly looking down at phone while I waited for assistance. The lady who issued refunds made a mistake and instead of apologizing, told me "don't cry" about it while she corrected the problem.

<Text>I unloaded a huge amount of CRV cans ( a 55 galon container full, crushed)and bottles and waited in line to be called by the THUGS that work there and he said there was " stuff" in em . This from people who take copper theft and drug habit crimminals....go figure!!!!   I believe that since my cans were already in the loading hopper they thought I would just walk away and let em rip me off....they were wrong as I was equipped to take them some were else which I did.  There was nothing substantial in thoes cans except sugar and vinegar residue.  RTRC no longer issues discount coupons either which of course is another sign of GREED!!!!!  Stay away from the CROOKS at RTRC!!!!< /Text>< pictures>

<review>This place and Danny's Recycling Centre in a Santa Clara are my two favourite places to go for recycling. Timely and attentive, very courteous, pay you what is due, though with this place their computer system is a bit odd. If you're owed $5 from CRV bottles they have to punch in the computer $4.99 but still pay you $5. Just today my receipt came out to be $2.98 but they paid me $3, I wasn't recycling my regular stuff so I didn't know how much it actually was. Weird, but it's just my OCPD rambling lol a few cents doesn't matter at all especially when staff are all pleasant people and that I'm recycling for the environment. Did I mention they're very courteous? The first time I did CRV recycling the guy told me I could count the bottles myself and just give him the numbers "because he trusts me." Another time, even after a bit confusion in the recyclables, we all left contended and they wished me a wonderful day. If they're busy they always find someone else to help me. Etc.. Would definitely come back again.<//review>< Pics>

I was ushered out like a criminal after asking what metals they purchase. And I was told that, in direct contradiction to their website, they only buy cans. I have a lot of copper to sell and these guys will never see any of it.< /Review>

Parking is awful.  First time I went the guy in charge yelled and scolded me for not knowing all the things that he wouldn't accept.  Second time he was yelling at everyone.  Don't like him enough I am not going back.<//text>

Called these guys trying to dispose of a dresser. After some initial confusion, they were very helpful directing me to a nearby place that would take care of me. Thanks!< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The service is fast but when it comes to weighing more, it is a robbery, my weight was 238.45 and 90 was received just for a plastic pallet that does not even reach 30 lbs.

<Review>They looked at my used, high-mileage Japanese import for a regular maintenance check. They were very organized, professional, and quick. They also provided me with photos from their inspection of parts of the engine that may lead to issues down the line, which was very helpful and something I’ve never had from a mechanic in the past. Highly recommended.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>This place is genuine, Rick and the staff have years of experience and gray staff that pay attention to detail.
They explain everything in a way anyone can understand. No games, real fair pricing, very timely and great warranty on what they fix. Usually during the holidays mechanics can best you up on price but not here.
It never felt awkward, never pressured, just welcomed.
They show you the parts they fix and they follow call you up a couple days after to ensure quality/answers. Lastly, they sanitize the vehicle before and after. This is my new family. Thanks Dorso's and happy Holidays.<//Review>< pictures>

Very professional atmosphere, remembers my name after a year of not seeing me. Took less than 18 hours for my car to be ready for pickup. Pricing is fair and they keep their shop very clean. Not to mention that Rick demonstrates his knowledge in a courteous manner and in such a way that even those unfamiliar with vehicles can understand and learn about their vehicle.< /review>

I LOVE these guys.  I often travel and if I need an oil change will get one somewhere.  They always tell me I need this or that.  I say ok I'll tell my mechanic.  I never need any of it. These guys are honest and don't try to add on unneeded services. Unfortunately that is hard to find in this industry. I've been going here for at least 5 years.  Will only stop when I move away.< /Review>

I dealt with Joe and Rick (hope I got your name right!).

Firstly, this was my first experience getting maintenance done in the bay area. So I was ready for some sticker shock. I had rear pads and rotors + oil change.

I was advised very well about what needed to be done, and what was recommended. I requested a few extra services be skipped and Dorso's obliged without complaint. So the sales approach is low pressure and friendly.

My only complaint was that I wasn't offered anything other than OEM or preferred parts. "Back home" many shops will offer cheaper (new) parts with your approval and if you waive a warranty on the service. I was NOT offered this and as a result the total was very pricey.

Lastly, I was entirely pleased with the professionalism. All removed parts were kept and shown to me. Everyone was very friendly. No one got upset when I refused additional services. And future service recommendations (and where to get them) were provided.

Dorso's seems like a great first stop for your auto service. In the future I might comparison price shop a bit before plunking down a ton of money for something I used to be able to do in my own driveway for 1/10th the cost. But perhaps that's just the way things are in the Bay Area... And since I can't service my own cars anymore, maybe I need to adjust my expectations.</text>

Brought my car here for and engine and cabin filter replacement. I found the team at Dorso's to be very professional and thorough with their work. I especially appreciated the COVID guidelines that were being followed at their location. I would definitely consider them again for future maintenance work.< /text>

With the new COVID guidelines still in effect, it was a bit of a challenge to get the appointment set up. The owner works at the shop, but has his off-site manager try and do the calls. A lot of back and forth. Tedious and a bit unnecessary.  I did an 75k tune-up, and get an issue fixed. It was a lot more than I cared to spend, but got it done. They also didn't tell me when the car would be done until I called them. They did a good job. Overall, I would recommend.</text>

Fantastic service from the moment I stepped in the shop. I learned about them from google and yelp reviews and decided to try them out. Making an appointment was not an hassle. Just pick up the phone and dial the number on their website( # on google does not work). I had to do a vehicle inspection for my car and Rick was so helpful on what package to choose. He has a good understanding of what the customer needs and he even follows up with photos and takes time to explain to you if you are interested. I would definitely recommend this service. Prices are also reasonable than other auto shops and dealers.< /text>

<text>My fiancé brought his car here after it needed to be towed. He received such great service, so I decided to bring my car here. They communicate with you SO well and take pictures of what they find in your car. I had to take my car to a transmission place to get my transmission looked at and Dorso’s called me a few weeks later to ask what they found in my transmission. Such great service! I was also very nervous having my car worked on during the pandemic because I’m high-risk, but I wasn’t worried at all here! They covered the steering wheel, put seat covers on, wore masks and gloves, and they wiped down the inside of my car before handing it back to me. I’ll be taking my car here for service from now on!<//text>< Pictures>

Fantastic service. Can’t recommend them enough!

Rick went above and beyond to make sure that a complicated problem with the steering module of my 06 Lexus GS430 was taken care of.

Not only that - but he was more than willing to quadruple check every issue to ensure that I would pass smog.

He also stayed much later so that I could pick up my car after work. Thoroughly inspected my vehicle and gave honest, unbiased, advice.

Thanks Rick! I will definitely be back.<//text>

Best auto shop ever.  I appreciate honest auto mechanics since repair work can be so expensive or your car is misdiagnosed.  Dorso’s did an oil change on my car and discovered a brake fluid leak, which they said should be covered under my manufacturer warranty, since my car isn’t even two years old.  I’m lucky Dorso’s caught this!<//Review>

We were surprised to see the brake fluid leak on your Hyundai also on such a new, low mileage vehicle.

Dorso's continues to provide quality customer service with all my car repairs and servicing. I'm personally very particular about how my car runs and I always give my full trust to Rick and his team. Rick will give a thorough breakdown of your repairs. Prices always seem fair. Simply put, they run a great shop. They tend to be busy, but I don't mind waiting to make an appointment when it means that I'll receive a quality job.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>My vehicle was worked on by high quality individuals. The problems where fixed fast and done correctly. These guys know what they are doing.

Rick makes you feel very welcome at his shop and is completely honest. He did not overwhelm me and He always made sure I understand what was wrong with my car. The thing that I appreciated the most was how Rick kept me updated and took the time to explain to me what I have to do to prevent further damage to my vehicle. He also took the time to contact a tire shop to grab a quote for me.

I can’t not stress how much I appreciated the way they run things at Dorso’s Automtive Repair and take the time to talk with their customers.

Also, I trust Dorso’s Automtive Repair with my Fiancé’s vehicle who had car trouble the next day I picked mine up. would highly recommend Dorso’s Automtive Repair to anyone who is having car trouble. You will not regret it.

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Dorso's is the most outstanding automotive repair shop in Fremont. I've been to many, but none can compare with the outstanding mechanical knowledge, excellent customer service and personal touch that Dorso's provides. I have an old classic and wouldn't trust it to anyone else. When I pick up my car, I don't just get a receipt with a list of repairs attached to it: I get a detailed and rather lengthy printed report explaining what was done. Joe personally reviews and thoroughly explains to me each part of the report. He even shows me the old parts that were replaced.  This shop is honest and trustworthy and prices are comparable. When you drop off your car at Dorso's, rest assured that you're leaving it with the best of the best.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Dorso’s continues to provide excellent, thorough, efficient, professional, friendly  & honest service.

Several months back on a routine service, there was an initially unknown problem after getting my car back. Pete worked on my car, even on the weekend (and they’re not open on the weekend, plus he had a funeral to attend).  I was supposed to get the car back on Saturday but Pete was unable to reach me, despite several phone call attempts (I was in an area with no service). Dorso’s had already provided a rental for me & graciously let me keep through the weekend. Definitely above & beyond service!

I brought my 1997 Honda Civic to them when my windshield wipers went out--right before the big rain! Yikes! They had the parts in stock and were able to get me taken care of right away.  They also provided a prioritized plan to keep my poor old Honda running. The staff are all warm, courteous & professional, and I really appreciate being able to bring my car to someone I can trust.<//review>

<review>I am highly satisfied with the customer service and auto services provided by the team at Dorso's Automotive. It's an anxious and stressful experience when you have car problems and especially thinking about finding a mechanic that will be honest and qualified to do the repairs needed. From my first interaction with Lori, Rick, Rob, and Joe - they explained every single step of the process from identifying and diagnosing what the root cause was for my car stalling to explaining what needs to be done to address the problem. As a female, I am wary of being offered services that I do not need. But that never happened with Dorso's Automotive. They were efficient in finding what was wrong and were timely in fixing and repairing my vehicle once they knew what was going on. They provided me a clear and fair estimate of total cost for the repairs and even worked to give me discounts where it was possible. When I picked up my car, they gave me a rundown of everything that they worked on in my car and showed me the auto parts that they removed and replaced. To me, it is always a good sign when a mechanic shows you the car parts at the end - it's a sign of honesty and attention to detail.  After getting my car back, it runs better than when I first bought it from the dealership. I will definitely continue to go to Dorso's Automotive for all my needed car maintenance and repairs.< /review>< rate>

<text>Brought my car in for the second oil change.  I have known Rick since he was in high school, as he and my son are good friends.  I hadn't brought my car to him before because I had a deal with the shop I was using that gave me free oil changes for life for a fee, which paid for itself in two oil changes!!!  They closed their shop so I began taking my car to Rick at Dorso's.  Rick, Joe and Tristan are all super nice guys and they are as honest as they come when it comes to working on my car.  They are extremely thorough, and HONEST.  They go over the invoice with you step by step.  Plus, if you are local, they give you a ride home and pick you up when your car is done.  I won't take my car any place else now. Thanks Rick, Joe and Tristan for being so awesome!!< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Love this place. They understand that if you treat your customers fairly they will return and your business will thrive! Rick and Joe are honest people. If you are sick of being taken advantage of buy crooked auto repair shops this is the place you need to bring your business!</Review>

Best service anywhere and it's not even close. I currently drive about an hour down to them to get literally anything done on my car, and would still do that if I lived all the way across the state. Don't waste your time anywhere else.<//review>

I won't take my vehicles anywhere else. This shop has been maintaining my family's vehicles for 20+ years, and now that I'm an adult on my own, I continue to take my vehicles here. Professional, clean, respectful, transparent and prompt. Rick and his crew are extremely thorough, taking the time to explain everything in simple terms. Their technical knowledge and decades of experience puts other shops to shame. He will even keep your broken worn out parts to show you, when you come to pick up your vehicle and walks you through all the repairs made. There is no guess work and parts changing here; they expertly and properly diagnose the problem and then promptly contact you to inform you. I recommend them to all my friends, coworkers, neighbors and have yet to hear a single bad thing about their shop. You will not be disappointed with them, don't waste your time going elsewhere. East Bay's best kept auto secret.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><Resp>None< /Resp><Review>The guy's at Dorsos went above and beyond when looking at my car. Not only pointing out some crucial variables wrong with my car, they made the repairs at an affordable price. They sincerely take it personally when it comes to making sure your car is absolutely safe for driving. The owner of the shop (Rick) walked me through the inspections they made and the repairs they were gonna do to remedy the problems, so through the entire process, I was kept in the loop. Rick understands that not everyone is car savvy, but makes sure to explain it making sure even a novice could understand. Not many places do that, but this place does. The people at this shop are extremely professional and I recommend anyone and everyone to give them a shot. You won't regret it!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>One of the big challenges when you move to a new area is to find businesses you can trust. We were fortunate to have a friend recommend Dorso's back in 1999 and we have been loyal customers ever since...with 2 cars reaching over 200000 miles each and with a third we know they will see through to that milestone. Amazing attention to detail and top notch customer service makes them the best trusted advisors you could find for your motor vehicles, and for a reasonable price.</Review>< Resp>

They didn't try to cheat me out of money by telling me my car will never work again or giving me false info. They even gave me two options on how to get it fixed. They also put washer fluid in my car and cleaned the outside of it. I will for sure be going back to them if i need more work in the future and will always recommend them</text>< pictures>

I picked this place because of the reviews. Glad to see that it held up. The service was awesome, and they were very upfront about what was needed/not needed.

They even brought me to work and picked me up as I had to leave the car in the shop all day. Would recommend this place to everyone.</Text>

I couldn't be happier with the service and transparency here.  They really do their best to make sure they explain exactly what's done to my vehicle, and why.  If they can't diagnose a problem, they will work until they do.  I'll bring my vehicles to them as long as I'm local.<//Text>

Rick and Joe have been taking care of all our cars for several years. We always come away from the experience knowing they have performed quality work (always stand behind everything they do) and are fair and honest in the process. They will always tell you everything that needs to be done to the car, but don't apply pressure if you tell them you need to wait on some of the less critical items. We have recommended Dorso's to our friends, and will continue to do so in the future!</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I went to smaller garages to have my 2003 Tacoma fixed for failing smog due to a fuel EVAP system-related check engine code.

I paid a lot to have a thorough diagnostic performed, and the quote to replace my fuel EVAP canister (aka charcoal canister) was even more than I had already spent at other garages, so it was a little discouraging at first.

However, in addition to this quote I got the full technical report which was highly professional. They were also willing to answer my questions that came up as I tried to replace the canister myself.

Ultimately I was able to do the replacement myself and clear the code to successfully pass smog. The relatively expensive diagnostic was money well spent at Dorso’s, because I was able to take the report and figure out exactly what to do and ended up saving money. They are very competent and provided excellent support. I will absolutely return to them in the future whenever my family’s vehicles have complex problems.</Text>< pictures>

<text>After having two vehicles to this shop recently, one of which involving a non-typical engine mechanical problem, I am extremely pleased with the results.  The mechanics and leadership are professional, highly competent, and respectful in their relationships with customers.  Though not a normal repair for them, I was impressed with their diagnostic knowledge and capability, and effectiveness in researching potential issues with my '03 Z06 Corvette.  They handled the replacement of a broken valve spring, and the other 15 springs per my request, along with some other work in outstanding fashion.  They may not be the cheapest, but when you consider the technology, special tooling, and staffing requirements to handle these types of repairs well, they are a true value in comparison with a dealership and other less capable shops.  I was also impressed by the level of transparency and honesty, and loved their attention to gathering and tracking all historical data associated with the car for current and future reference.  I also thought their lead mechanic was outstanding.  Glad to have found this shop for my future needs.< /text><user_name>Marty Smith< /user_name><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp></record>

I recently had my truck checked out by these guys as I was prepping for a long drive out of state and my truck has been into another shop but seems that the issue is still there. The crew at Dorso's approached the situation from the day I called them, to dropping off my truck, providing much-needed updates during the fix/process especially if they found something that wasn't discussed during the handover, providing detailed recommendation for the fix and estimate of it, to the pick-up day and final walkthrough of what they found and have done and what to look out for... was hands down awesome!

My professional line of work involves collaborating with customers and requires thorough communication along the process. As my former boss always say - let's delight our customers and give them a positive experience they will never forget... The whole crew at Dorso's exactly executed this kind of service and this is the first time I actually having experienced this as the customer.

My only regret was that I should have decided to come to Dorso's the first time.

You guys are Rockstar!

Thank you

Dorso's Automotive provided excellent services with reasonable expectations given up front so we knew what was being done and how much it would cost. We've been given updates along the process and delivery was as promised.</review>

Called the other day because I needed to file a report and the officer who called me back was extremely rude and not helpful at all. Your job is to serve and protect your community, yet someone from your community was calling for help and you treated me like dirt. So very disappointed.<//review>

< Review>
I've had multiple bad experiences with these "public servants" now. I called them to help with the theft of my store and I've had an officer call me and say he just drove around the building and didn't see anyone but I walked outside while talking to him and he wasn't even at my store,then I said well they're still inside my store; he told me he'd "turn around" and come help. Two hours pass then the customer walked out with store merchandise.
Every time I call for help they act very rude like I'm wasting their time just to get a simple no trespass order since that's what the police officers told me to do when I'm catching repeat thieves. This department is very lazy and refuses to protect and serve<//Review>

In my personal experience with this department The lack of training in dealing with domestic violence, children, and special needs, needs to be addressed and more education needs to be provided. In my personal experience with this department it has made me feel uncomfortable uneasy and upset to think if something happens I have to call them. I strongly support law enforcement but this department would benefit from more program training in dealing with the public.< /text>

As fine a police force as you'll find anywhere. People in Citrus Heights go up to the cruisers to tell our officers how much they appreciate them. The story goes that when one of our officers asked a transient why he kept coming back to Citrus Heights, he answered that the police were so nice here. The chief of police has won the Paul Q Wilson award twice, which recognizes community policing. So proud of these men and women.<//text>

I just witnessed a moment every citizen would appreciate. Not the sad arrest of a negligent mother, but the way the policeman handled the child in the back seat of the vehicle... as if it were his own child. He embraced the child with love and protection, putting the child at ease in a potentially traumatic moment. Bravo. Thank You CHPD</review>

Thank you officers for your quick response tonight. It was not an emergency situation, but I was happy to see you guys at our building when I called your non-emergency number to report after hour loiterers at the  Sylvan Oaks Library. People are uncomfortable returning their materials to the depository when there are people hanging out around the library building at all hours. There is vandalism on the outside of the facility, especially when people hack into the electric outlets and light fixtures to plug in their electronic devices. These "campers" also leave trash all around the building, which has to be cleaned up by the library staff, especially after Sunday and Monday when we are closed.< /Review>

Typically I have had nothing but good experiences with the Citrus Heights Police Department.  Unfortunately, today has been the exception.  This morning at 6am my husband came out to find his car had been broken into.  We understand this is a small case, but there have been multiple car break-ins around the area and we have the description of 2 suspicious men in our area.  We were told that an officer was being dispatched to our home to dust for finger prints and make a report.  It has been over 4 hours and no officer.  We called once and was told they would be to our home within an hour.  When that hour came and went, we called again and were then told 'sorry our officer is on a bigger case'.  We are homeowners, tax payers and members of the community.  Pretty sure that our tax dollars go in part to fund our police.  Today, I can say that I am dissatisfied with with police response and based on this lack of response it seems the cars in our neighborhood will continue to get broken into and I guess we will all hold out hope that their crimes do not escalate to something more serious!< /Text>

Recently, I received a traffic citation from a Citrus Height's Police Officer. Like most drivers, I did not enjoy receiving the ticket. However, I must say that the officer was so polite that I wanted to invite him to my home  for my back yard barbeque that I was speeding to. Kindly, with a friendly smile on his face, he declined my offer.

I love having their presence in Citrus Heights and seeing them pull over people for talking on their cell phones.  I feel very protected living here.

I had a attempted break in couple days ago. Fortunately, I was home and handled it. Tonight, I requested a K9 unit to search my house because transients are still trying to break in? Did they leave or hide something? The CH Sheriff department very polite, respectful, and understanding after clearing my house. THANK YOU

These are situations we love and respect the police, why don't we EVERYDAY?</review>

First she said get the info from sac county PD, as they don't have a helicopter. I live in orangevale near CH. Told her they referred me to her as it was an assist for their Dept. Could only say they were looking for someone. Completely useless!</Text>< Pics>

One month ago I caught a burglar in my home. The police that responded were amazing. They ALL
showed great caring and compassion, AND they got caught the bad guy. Thank you all for your amazing work.<//Review>

<Text>CHPD Cops that lack common sense should be fired. The temperature of the asphalt parking lot would have been close to 170 degrees, according to estimates by the National Weather Service. An egg begins frying at about 144 degrees, and human skin “is instantly destroyed” at 162, according to the service. Nelson was held down on the pavement for five minutes or more.  This is going to cost tax payers big time</Text>< resp>

<Review>Citrus heights police department would not respond to a call I made regarding my upstairs neighbor who was also an employee of the apartment complex. I had seen a fiber optic cable hanging from their apt pointed directly into my unit. I than rented a scanner to detect further surveillance equipment which it did directly over me in the living room., Citrus heights PD would not respond saying " people don't do that in citrus heights." I suffered further trauma at the hands of these same neighbors/employee to the point where we moved out. This would have been prevented had I established this police report and arrest. The same employee than went onto make a key to my apartment and I suffered further trauma and stress. Instead of her being fired and arrested we moved out of the complex. A few months later I was harassed by an officer at a house we were living at down the street off Sunrise Avenue. The officer said he had been notified by neighbors that I was a squatter and said that I didn't belong there. I had to have the owner call him to verify me as a resident of the home even after I showed him bills with my name on them.</Review>< pictures>

Counter personnel seem to feel their job is to prevent access to police investigators and staff. Once you force the issue via Administration, you are able to get help; however, it has appeared that there is a LOT of pre - judgements going on, based upon background & not objective evaluation of current information.  I was very frustrated when I tried to get help for legitimate issues on a few occasions.< /review>

Was on sylvan corners getting a pizza tonight at little ceases and when I was getting into my car I seen a citrus heights police car parked then hear sirens and see flashing lights. As cars pull over to the side of the road, I see the cop come speeding up like a emergency was taking place so i think there's somthing going on but when the cop gets out of his car I hear him say to his fellow officer "see told you I can make it hear in less then five minutes" then they laugh and go into Starbucks and order coffee. Wow that's a little to much  someone please give these people some sense of what is right and what is wrong. They are just bullies.</text>

Second most unprofessional LE personnel I have ever dealt with.  If I witnessed a CHPD in distress, I would turn my head and walk, scumbags are on their own. Sac Co Sheriffs are a complete different story. I would go out of my way to help a sheriff.Would not surprise me at all if the populous started revolting towards CHPD and their Nazi mentality.

By the way, I had one experience with an Officer Jones whose conduct was  exemplary while conducting a traffic stop on me for speeding. Very professional, and personable.

Just let it be known that we have multiple videos and photos of questionable conduct just waiting for that right moment, and I cant wait for that moment.

I was in a car accident and requested an officer come by to write a police report. The dispatcher refused to send anyone over. I asked her about 3 times explaining that i need someone over and she responded that if there are no injuries we send no one. Consequently, my car has not been fixed from the damage due to both of us having liability and the other driver getting arrested the day after he hit me for drug possession. This happened all the way in MARCH! I have a hole in my car that looks like a shark bit through it! When i go to base its the laughing stock of the whole facility. Thank you CHP. I should've stayed in WI where they actually respond.</review>

PERSONALLY, I HAVE ONE BAD EXPERIANCE WITH THE CHPD. I WAS GOING THROUGH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE WITH MY KIDS FATHER WHEN I WAS 20, (I AM 29 NOW). THEIR WAS AN ICCIDENT ONE 4TH OF JULY @ 3AM , MY KIDS FATHER AND 2 OTHER MEN KICKED DOWN MY DOOR AND PROCEEDED TO GRABMY 2 BOYS OUT OF BED. I HAD A COUPLE GIRLFRIENDS STAYING OVER FOR 4TH OF JULY AND I YELLED TO ONE OF THEM TO CALL 911. DURING THAT PROCESS I WAS FIGHTING TO GET ONE OF MY KIDS AWAY FROM HIM. THERE WAS YELLING AND SCREAMING AND MY FRIEND HAD THE PHONE RIPPED AWAY AND DISCONNECTED IN THE MIDDLE OF SPEAKING TO THE 911 OPERATOR 3 TIMES AND THEY STILL DIDNT SEND ANYONE  OVER RIGHT AWAY. THE COPS DID NOT SHOW UP UNTIL 30 MINUTES AFTER THE GUYS LEFT WITH MY CHILDREN. THEN ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME, "YOU NEED TO TELL TE DISPATCHER THAT ITS IN EMERGENCY" REALLY? I THOUGHT THE SCREAMING AND THE PHONE BEING DISCONNECTED 3 TIMES WOULD HAVE EEN A GOOD SIGN ALONG WITH ME NEEDING TO EVEN CALL 911 TO BEGIN WITH. I KNOW THIS DOESNT SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE CHPD, BUT THAT NIGHT JUST HAD ME LOSE FAITH IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT.< /review>

Sacramento Bee published an article stating the Citrus Heights Police kill more people than any other community in California. The Grand Jury results were that the traffic camera system is rigged. They only serve themselves and their profit. I avoid Citrus Heights when possible.</Review>

I'm used to walking in and there's one or 2 people stationed at the register and they don't say much. And I usually have to wait in line behind others to ask a question or getting help felt like I was like pulling teeth. At this Crenshaw location, they had multiple people working the floor & I saw each person in there get individual attention. The young guy that helped me showed me all the available options based off my criteria. When I walked in & when I left, even the other clerks that I didn't speak with greeted me and gave well wishes at my departure. Even though I didn't make a purchase, I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent customer service displayed.< /Review>< pics>

Christian and Diana were wonderful.Though T mobile customer service is good I have never had customer service this amazing in any other T mobile experience. When they didn't have the phone we wanted Christian drove to the location that had it and brought it back to the store. We had another issue with a payment and Diana's quick thinking made our transaction possible. We went in to get one phone and ended up with 2 phones and a tablet today no doubt due to this dynamic T mobile customer service team. STELLAR< /Review>

The worse store and customer service I've ever dealt with. I went in to replace a phone that had been verified 2 days ago to qualify for warranty exchange, phone wasn't charging, but because they met their cap, I was told the phone will ship to this store. I walk in, one guy checks the phone while the other one is looking for the replacement, the phone wasn't found so the guys helping us goes to the back with my phone to check, comes back and tells me my phone has a crack in the back. The phone was inspected in much more detail at the first store, reason why the exchange was approved, and kept in a case the entire time. I'm then told to file an insurance claim and that it will cost me between 175 and 225. I told two of them that this phone is under the 360 protection and that it will cost 99$ they tell me that it's not that little, even after I told them assurant sent everyone a letter explaining the changes in prices affective August 2018. Why is it that a customer knows more about your insurance than 2 of your workers that sell it to us? I call assurant, and after agreeing that it was ridiculous that the phone randomly comes back cracked, said that if I paid the 99$ in the store, they should of given me the replacement phone. I will never go to this store and it makes complete sense that you have a 3.8 rating. I went Tuesday 1.29.19 around 7pm. Train your employees better.<//review>

The manager Richard was no help and when asked who would help me he would just look around play on his phone and say ill get someone for you. Talk about getting your priorities straight.

<text>The service there sucks. Have to wait long time to be attended.  The employees don't seem to care about old customers, but they seem to care about new customers. I had a new phone that wasn't working well, but they didnt change it to a new one even when I hadn't for 14 days. I ended up paying money for a "exchange."<//text>< userid>

<text>The rest rooms have been closed for over two months.During this period, I have requested to use the men's room and I was graciously let in by one of the male clerks. At 83 years old when you gotta go you gotta go. Recently, after making my purchases I asked one of the male clerks near the center counter to open the men's room for me and a blond hair lady, possibly the manager, responded that the rest rooms were out of order and under no circumstances would she allow them to be opened. I questioned her veracity based on the the knowledge of the lengthy closure and suspicion that she was lying insisting on her story that they were out of order. I thought, right to the customers only. I like this store, but something is wrong with the management. There seems to be a lot of employee turnover and avoidance by the employees to initiate help, you have to excuse yourself for interrupting their chit chat sessions. I will not return to this store until the bathrooms are open and the customer service improved. They are not the only hardware store in town.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1616197373956, 'text': 'Hi Clif.

<Review>The product wasn’t the issue - the Store Manager was very rude, short, unhelpful, and overall very counterproductive to picking up an online order. I did everything on my end of their process, while the staff did nothing on their end of the deal. Things were made more stressful and difficult only because she lacks basic sense, apathy and manners/people skills. She refused to take responsibility for all of the faults, of whatever you call that ‘system’ in place for online pickups. Like most stores like this, I wasn’t surprised when she claimed she was the Store Manager after I asked for one, I just feel really bad for her staff. Because of her lack of leadership and basic guest service skills, I will be going literally anywhere else other than this store & tractor supply from now on. That abomination of a manager at the Paso store, as well as whoever hired her in the first place, should both have been let go long before this. She somehow made an already horrible experience, even worse. Incompetence all around, at every level.</Review>< time>

< Review>
I've always loved tractor supply, but today I went in to their Paso Robles, California store and there were quite a few employees not wearing masks. I'm not sure why they would have a sign posted before you enter suggesting that we wear masks yet allow their employees to go without.< /Review>

The employees here are great. Extremely helpful and willing to go the extra mile. The store is clean and well organized. I came here to buy a truck toolbox. The only box they had that was the color and size I wanted had a small dent in it. They have me an additional percentage off. I would have rather had one that was not dented but it's all they had. Cheaper is always a good thing. Would definitely come back.< /review>

< Review>
Very good quality healthy baby chickens. However, since I have been going to this place they type of employees make me feel like I dont belong in that store. I am colored and the feeling that I  get  is a feeling that people of color get when we know there is a problem with our presence and it has to do with skin. So I usually just make my caucasian girlfriend go in there instead and they treat her just fine. She even admitted its weird how dirrerent the feeling is when I am with her though........after 4 years Im kinda tired of it but I still need the store.</Review>

<review>Sorry to say there was a customer there that turned her visit into a political issue by screaming at the the TS staff that they were racists.  I purchased an XL dog  crate, the TS employee went to the stockroom and on his way out of the stockroom this woman ask him to get dog food off of a shelf.  He said he had a customer waiting up front but he would be back to help her.  She went up to the front of the store, stood on the tip of her toes and yelled for all to hear that the employee was a racist.  She was white,  I am white and the employee was white? ?  Your employees handled it very calmly and with class...you can be proud.  She was so far out of line.<//review><gmap_id>0x80eccf8cc468a1b9:0xefc3ac0320077040</gmap_id><Date>1530485815310< /Date></record></dataset><record>

(Reverse chronological order)

July 10th
Update: After 2 more July 10th calls to Paso Robles (good ol' Tom & Leslie again), I finally was forced to call the SLO store got Mr. Henley's (district manager) number.
Then called him and he called back within 30 minutes stating he saw nothing had been done to refund the monies during the last 6 weeks and he submitted a full refund immediately. If that term can be used after 6 weeks and about 12 calls?  >:-(

Thank you Mr Henley.

WTH# John, Tom, Leslie in Paso Robles!?

July 10, 2018
Sfter confirming with Master Card that Tractor Supply has not yet refunded the money nor replied to the dispute I was forced to open to get my refund, yet another call was made to  the store again .  Talked to both Tom (asst manager) and Leslie (asst manager)  both do not understand that until a full refund is made the disputed funds will remain in limbo.  Leslie acknowledged she committed to a full refund earlier but changed her mind after we talked on June 21st.  She promised to have Tom (store manager) contact me.

June 21
Called Tractor Supply Paso Robles to follow up on the refund owed,  as no email correspondence had been received regarding the refund, once again spoke to Leslie (asst manager) got another load of "I thought corporate would do that but since I've been on maternity leave the policy must have changed, we now do refunds at the store level. I will do the refund for the full amount today."

June 9th
Talked with Leslie (asst manager) on Sat at 9:23am.  Leslie claimed had I driven to the store again to request the refund, the credit would have been immediate, but since I called on June 6th, the credit will now take two weeks and corporate needs to process it. Oy vey :-(

June 4 - 6
Talked with 4 people on the phone, Tom (assistant manager), John (manager), Kate (sales), and Jennifer (sales).

Also went into the store two folks were there no help was available (June 5th at about 7:30pm). One associate commenced helping me but could not find the order, then left to help another customer that happened by before we were finished.  Too much disorganization to continue to to business with Tractor Supply.

There are too many efficient organizations that provide excellent customer service to online buyers.

"Our Return Policy
If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your order, simply contact customer service for instructions on how to return your order for a full refund. If and when you are ready to place another order, we will be happy to serve you again."

Short chubby manager is a d-bag, one or two helpful employees, the store is nice though. Bad area, tons of crack heads trolling the parking lot. Felt unsafe.< /review>

Great selection of dog food,  products and staff that are friendly and knowledgeable! I travel from slo to paso just to go there. Way better than petsmart and petco where the staff are so unintelligent and rude with high prices and no selection.< /Text>

Was going to buy a couple more things but couldn't pick up one item so I guess I need to go somewhere else where I can get some help.

Service: It was a walk up and order type of service. They were super helpful with helping you decide what you wanted.

Drinks/Crepes: The crepe itself is very good! We got the green tea crepes. Nice and fluffy but also crispy at the same time! Oh, did I mention all of their ingredients are organic?! We also go the sparkling lemonade! That was super refreshing.

Place: Got kind of lost with the GPS. However, this place is super cute! Only 3 tables though, so don't bring a big group.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>This is my favorite japanese style crepe place. I have been coming here for years and it never disappoints. First time was in 2011.

Toppings and ingredients are always fresh. The creeper batter is always amazing, lots of flavor and the right amount of chewiness to lightness.

Prices can get high if you build your own crepe, but the location is in Beverly Hills..

I always get the Nutty Banana with earl grey crepe but they no longer have the earl grey. A little disappointing but they have other great choices.

Staff is friendly, and the place is quite small. So, if you catch it at a busy time, it's tough to move around.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>I really loved their crêpes. It was the perfect mix. It is definitely something for people with a sweet tooth. I would love to give 5 stars but the guy who worked there was not helpful at all and seemed to be either hungover or just not in the mood to talk to the costumer in the morning.</text>< pics>

I waited about  five minutes for someone to take my order. No one greeted me or took my order even though they clearly saw me, and there was only one other customer waiting for his food so I just walked out. Crepes look good but unfortunately the staff was not very friendly.</review>< pics>

Cute Japanese ice cream shop.

I fell in love with this place ever since my friend, Emily, posted a pic of her icecream crepe on Facebook.

Her or my other friend warned me that it looks better than it tastes and she was right.

It's a cute place to go but the quality of the ice cream wasn't amazing enough for me to want to come back for more. Great for foodie-photo-addicts like me :)<//Review>

I had a Harajuku Crepe in Japan and this place in Beverly Hills tasted better!! :) I'm impressed! :D

This is a cute little cafe in Beverly Hills. There are about 2 small tables and a couch for seating. The guy who makes the crepes is Japanese and is really nice!

If you're here, you gotta try a crepe. You can also order boba or tea too. How it works is that you get to customize your crepe by which type of crepe you want, fruits, toppings, fillings, and/or ice cream. And with each thing you choose, there's a cost.

What I got:
-Earl grey crepe $3
-Strawberries $1
-Whipped cream $0.50
-Nutella $0.50
-Green tea ice cream $0.50

Total: $6 (Totally worth it!!)

The crepe was thin and perfectly cooked! Everything was well-portioned and wasn't too sweet.

Only downside is the parking. You gotta try to find a meter or park in one of the public lots/garages.

Overall, I am a fan and will definitely be back! A great place for dessert!<//Text>

This place is located in the  heart of Beverly Hills,  right off of rodeo drive.  It's kind of a hole in the wall,  which is weird because of its location.

The menu is create your own, with each topping ranging from $0.50 - $1.00. I came here for the the early Grey crepe, which sets it apart from other crepe places.  I topped it off with red beans,  big mochi balls,  and black sesame ice cream.  First bite,  amazing! You can actually taste the Earl Grey flavor.  Their ice cream and mochi balls were delicious.  If you're in the  area,  definitely stop by and support this small business.</Text>

I base all crepe from japan and sophies crepe on SF.  This place didn't cut it for me.  I wish the whip cream tasted fluffier and the crepe more crispy.< /Review>

< Review>
This place is so damn good!

I've been wanting to try this place for the longest! We had dinner on the Westside and decided to save room to try Harajuku Crepe for dessert.

We shared an original crepe filled with fresh strawberries, green tea ice cream, and nutella. It was so good that sharing was hard. I wanted it all to myself!

Finding this place was a tad frustrating. It was nighttime so it was dark and hard to see the sign. We kept missing it! JFYI, it's located right next to Vidal Sassoon. Parking sucks too! BUT you can park at the Beverly Gardens. It's metered parking and free after 8PM.< /Review>

<Text>Don't really understand what the hype is around Harajuku Crepes. Came here on a Saturday 15 minutes before closing and was amazed by how affordable these crepes are, and the option of choosing sesame and earl grey crepe batter. But after asking the cashier, I decided to stick with the original batter, since it was most popular. Included in the crepe, I had banana, sheet of mochi, nutella, and almonds (they ran out of whipped cream). The crepe itself was $3, and the toppings ranged form $0.25 - $1. Mine came out to be $6-7.

When I received my crepe, I noticed how small it was and how little toppings it came with... No wonder why it was so cheap! Secondly, just from holding the crepe, I already knew it wouldn't be good (or as good as other crepes I've had), because it wasn't the crispy crepe. It was really soft, like a pancake, which I'm not really a fan of.

It wasn't a "bad" crepe per se, but just not my cup of tea. I probably wouldn't come back...<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I came here with a group of 9 on a Friday night. I got a matcha crepe with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and mochi. It came out to be $6. The crepe was rather smaller than other places, but still pretty good. The mochi was wrapped within the edges of the crepe, allowing me to eat ice cream and mochi in every bite.

One downside is that the place is rather small, so there wasn't much seating and we ended up standing outside to eat the crepes. In addition, waiting for the crepes took a while, especially considering the size of the crepes and the lack of customers while we were there.

Parking is also hard to find. Had to park near a park a block away.

Overall, not a bad crepe place, but definitely have had better with faster service.

Note: There is a minimum credit card charge of $6.</Text>

It is a small place I would recomend ordering the crêpes to go and walking  to the park near by. Staff is respectful, the crêpes are okay for the price.< /Review>

<Text>Harajuku Crepe is a fantastic place to take a break from all the Rodeo Drive window shopping ;) Crepes here are A-MA-ZING!

The owner developed his skills at a creperie in Japan, and invented his own recipe for this venture. The not-so-secret ingredient that makes the crepes here extra special is MOCHI powder! It makes the crepe itself slightly thicker than French style crepes while still maintaining the fluffy softness we looove.

What's also great is the selection of flavors--original, green tea, earl grey and buckwheat (yes, buckwheat!)--ensures that you're never going to get bored of the menu. Since they're very generous with their toppings, the finished crepes are often monstrous.

Finally, a worthy successor to the now defunct crepe nazi on Sawtelle!< /Text>< Pics>

Came here with gf for post-dinner dessert on a Socal roadtrip.

1. All-american with earl grey crepe and green tea ice cream instead of vanilla, 6.5
~Delicious. Green tea ice cream was excellent, and all the components were very fresh.<//text>

We went there to get our birthday scoops for my boyfriend's birthday. When we got there we told him that we wanted a kid scoop and he proceeded to give us quite bigger than the kids scoop. When we got to the register we let him know that it was the birthday scoop and he proceeded to tell us that we didn't inform him about that and that it was a kid scoop and we got into a back and forth about how we ask for a kids scoop and he scooped what he thought he heard and he made a big deal out of it. I just think it was a little bit unprofessional because we clearly said kids scoop and why he chose to give us a bigger scoop was kind of alarming. Because it made me think if we did not have a coupon he would have charged us for a bigger cup that we never asked for. So I would beware in this location<//text>

<Review>Their mint shake is delicious... for 8 bucks tho.... that price point is rough, but you won't get that yummy tasting mint choc chip shake anywhere else! I tried...Sonic doesn't have one, DQ is non existent in the East Bay, and Cecils is up next.

Yeah, get it is all I am saaaayin!</Review>< pics>

I really like this Baskin and Robbins. Even though the majority of employees seem to be young adults, their customer service is pretty on point. Also, I love to watch Michelle (the owner) decorate the cakes. She does a wonderful job and the atmosphere is always so relaxed!<//Review>

Place needs new owners.. the family is nice but they dont know how to properly take care of the ice cream. Some of it is old, needs to be replaced. Some of it is already half melted when served. I got a scoop of rocky road and it was icy, as if it had been melted and they refroze it.<//Review>

This specific baskin Robbins was the worst experience in a job I have ever had, the manager is a slave driver, she screams and miss treats her workers, apart from that, the building is disgusting, and the old lady's husband sits on the cumputer all day behind the counter watching videos and reading, and she makes her workers do things that aren't even on the job title like cleaning the air vents, cleaning gutters that have bacteria piled up at least half an inch high of nasty brown sludge... Over all it's just a bad business, I got fired for "stealing money" yet she was breaking baskin Robbins rules!! And forced me to work 12 hour shifts from open to closing time, and also her "favorite workers" we're stealing from the business as well but never once said a word to them, I hope they close this poor excuse for a business once and for all< /Review>

The taste is fairly good however I never found a restaurant that say no so much to a customer. Not even small things that are advertised on their menu they actually honored. Like once I ordered an spaghetti dish and as per the menu says you could select between tortillas or plantain and they told me I couldn't get plantain, after I asked them to include it even at extra cost they agree to it and yet I had to basically beg to get it boiled instead of fried..<//Text>

<Review>De catrachos solo tienen el nombre. Avoid this place if you’re in a rush, or very hungry. I was looking forward to eat here, because a friend recommended it, but I regret it. It is overpriced, I ordered two baleadas and they took 47 minutes to have my order ready. Y la baleada mía a duras penas tenía frijoles, ni mantequilla (crema) me le pusieron. I came to visit from another state, and was disappointed. Not coming again. Lo único que me gustó fue el chicharrón que le pusieron a la baluca.<//Review><rating>3</rating><name>Mrs López</name><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4xGibh2gkBc5KY_mLHy22XlSlLo8iKj02NtfE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdMf4RP79DXOkctPN5EAhcJKJvG-EDeJFKs2ER=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Time>1609554096393< /Time><gmapID>0x80c2c80e1bbef771:0x8c6af6f0bd7645d4<//gmapID>< userid>

Absolutely the best kabob place near La Crescenta La Canada. There are a few places that do kabob around here but this place is simply the best. Would definitely recommend. Usually get the chicken kabob plate.< /review>

<Review>Please stay away if you are limited on time. To have our order taken we waited 15 minutes. Fast forward to 40 minutes still no food on our table and no update. Finally after almost an hour our food arrived. I had to ask for refills on both coffee and water. Service could be better but food is flavorful. The service staff and kitchen staff need training in order for this restaurant to receive better feedback. Also, take out customers were complaining that they waited over and hour; many customers left because of the long wait.

<text>Even thought the area looked sketchy because we're from northern California. Right away we had a great experience one of the staff members moved his car so we could park.  the place was very clean and seem very safe inside. People were nice at all times. Good was great and that's a plus. In conclusion, beautiful gem hidden in some place in LA.</text>< Pics>

<text>I felt right at home with the warmth of the welcoming I received here, these people made me feel as if we have known each other for a lifetime! I was in awe with the treatment I received walking into this place, it was like actually experiencing the old saying, "MI CASA, SU CASA." As for the food, words just can't describe the happiness my taste buds were undergoing! It's like Grandma's old homestyle cooking, I love and miss you Abuelita! I will be returning again and again to "mi casa." ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 🇭🇳</text>< pics>

Good and delicious food, but time to wait to be served it's way more than 30min and more than once waiter forgets orders and rarely comebacks to the table to ask or see if you need anything else.

But if you got time to waist on waiting for food and finding parking it's worth it cause food its delicious but I prefer to go where it's more efficient as a 1st option and that's where my business go

Family okay
Kids chairs need cleaning< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Today I went to eat and literally how terrible the food is, I asked for a mojarra that looked like tasteless rubbery tasteless is not critical but that mojarra tasted like earth, the slices were not crunchy, they were ahuadas, the banana was ripe, we bought a cutlet, it seems that it was. overheated

(Original)
El día de hoy fui a comer y literalmente que pésima esta la comida pedí una mojarra que parecía hule insípida sin sabor no es crítica pero esa mojarra sabía a tierra las tajadas no eras crujientes estaban ahuadas el guineo estaba maduro compramos una chuleta igual parece que era recalentada</review>

(Translated by Google) What can I say about Sason K-tracho: The food is very good, good taste BUT the service is very lousy, the waitresses serve reluctantly, they have turtle service and to pay with a card they finish you off with an additional charge that not even the neighbors from 9.99 they still do not buy 5 dollars.

(Original)
Que puedo decir del Sason K-tracho: Muy buena la comida, buen sabor PERO en el servicio es muy pésimo, las meseras atienden de mala gana, tienen servicio de tortuga y para pagar con tarjeta te rematan con un cobro adicional que ni los vecinos del 9.99 no lo hacen aún comprando 5 dolares.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) APPALLING!!! Chicken SOUP that looks like sick soup. I only brought those vegetables, and a dry and salty chicken 👎 apart we bought other meals. Some enchiladas that tasted like reused and burned butter, and tasteless ground beef🤢 left us disgusted

(Original)
PÉSIMO!!! SOPA de pollo que parece sopa de enfermo. Solo traía esos vegetales, y un pollo seco y salado 👎 aparte compramos otras comidas. Unas enchiladas que sabían a manteca reahusada y quemadas, y la carne molida sin sabor🤢 nos dejó con asco</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The place is nice and cozy, its employees are very attentive, but its cuisine is horrible, I am a catracho and I am sorry to say that they cannot represent a catracha kitchen as it should be.
As a diner I am disappointed with this place the only two stars I leave is for its hospitality and cozy place, but to be a restaurant they must care more about improving their food

(Original)
El lugar es agradable y acogedor sus empleados muy atentos, pero su cocina es espantosa soy catracho y me da pena de decir que no pueden representar una cocina catracha como debe ser.
Como comensal me voy decepcionado de este lugar las unicas dos estrellas que dejo es por su hospitalidad y el lugar acogedor, pero para ser un restaurante deben preocuparse mas por mejorar su comida</review>< pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is one of my favorite restaurants in what is the Honduran gastronomy for me the # 1 as the seasoning catracho there is not very good attention very friendly girls all very clean and hygienic very rich all the food and very good prices I recommend them alive A little removed from where they are located but when I want a HONDURAN craving I go to where it is because as there are no others so go and try and I promise you they will not regret it and they will return again and again and again and they will not care distance

(Translated by Google) The food is good, but the bad that they charge more than one of what is said on the menu, I ordered a chicken broth that desia on the menu $ 14.99 and wing of the receipt come out with other prices, very bad from them , like the prices of the other meals, they charge you more

(Original)
La comida está buena , pero lo malo que le cobran más a uno de lo que díse en el menú,  yo pedí un caldo de gallina que desia en el menú $14.99 y ala hora del recibo salen con otros precios , muy malo de parte de ellos , al igual que los precios de las otras comidas , te cobran de más</Text>

(Translated by Google) I want to share what happened to me, I came from far away (another state) to eat the rich food of Honduras that for more than 4 years I did not eat the soup of mondongo and Las baleadas. Everything was very good until the lady cheated us IF she steal us unfortunately, I do not care about the money if she does not want to see the fool's face ... I ordered a soup of mondogo and chicken, in the menu said 14.99, when I reached the cashier to pay and I asked him for the bill, he gave me only the total almost $ 100. Asked; Can you give me the invoice with prices please? And she replied that she has to wait for us to do it, we exchanged the payment card, trusting that everything would be fine and maybe I would be wrong, I charge almost 100 and she always says she wants the invoice ???? I was waiting for the bill I charged almost 17 soups and 5 baliada sodas to 3 ... Osea I was well ugly and did not want to give me the bill I had to wait to see other prices completely different menu ... Finally I left without saying anything because I felt more sorry for ME. I will never go back and my sister was her second time but she will never come back ... Those things keep the client away.

Quiero compartir lo que me paso, vine desde muy lejos (otro estado) por comer la comidita rica de Honduras que desde hace mas de 4 años no comia la sopita de mondongo y Las baleadas. Todo estaba muy bien hasta que la señora nos estafo SI NOS ROBO lamentablemente, no me preocupa el dinero si no que nos quiera ver la cara de tontos... Yo pedi una sopa de mondogo y de pollo, en el menu decia 14.99 , cuando llegue a caja a pagar y le pedi la factura me dio solo el total casi $100 me asombre!! Le pregunte; me puede dar la factura con precios por favor?  Y ella respondio se tiene que  esperar a que la haga intercambiamos la tarjrta de pago confiando en que toda iba estar bien y talves yo estaria equivocada, me cobro los casi 100 y me dice siempre quiere la factura???? Osea yo estaba esperando la factura me cobro casi a 17 las sopas y 5 cada baliada los refrescos a 3 ... Osea me estafo bien feo y no queria darme la factura tuve que esperar para ver otros precios totalmente diferentes al menu... Finalmente me fui sin decir nada porque me dio mas pena a MI. Nunca volvere y mi hermana era su segunda ves pero nunca volvera... Esas cosas alejan al cliente.<//text>

I love this place ... it's the closest taste to Honduran food. It gets busy, and that's because the food and taste are delicious !!
