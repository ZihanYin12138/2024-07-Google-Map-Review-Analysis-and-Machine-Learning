After contacting a local Farmer's Insurance-Ruth Stroup on Grand Ave., Oakland, CA, her colleague Alexandria (Allie) maintained several weeks of communication with me during the end of the pandemic via email and phone.  She was very responsive, informative and patient with questions.  I finally decided to go with another insurance company but Allie was professional even then, as she had been all along the way.  I recommend her highly.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I switched to Farmers Insurance from my previous carrier which I had been with for over 15 years. I was reluctant at first. I mean, after 15 years you really need to feel comfortable making a change. I worked with Allie at Farmers. I must have asked for 20 quotes, changing coverage, deductible and some other options. It took me a couple of weeks to make a move but Allie made it a lot easier with her patience and knowledge.  I now have more coverage on my home and auto for less than my previous well known insurance carrier.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Ruth Stroup and her team (including Danielle) are professionals and put the client's needs first.  They listen to the customer, ask good questions and dig in to find a feasible solution in a timely manner.  Just today-- Danielle stepped up and had a solution for us in less than 24 hours.
Pro-active and professional.  Thank you!</review>

< Review>
I work for a mortgage processing company and I am responsible for requesting update insurance policies. Normally this is not an easy task and usually takes a couple to several days. Not with Danielle Renteria though!! Within a couple of hours, she provided everything that I needed - nothing that needed corrections, absolutely nothing additional needed to be done. This is a rare scenario so I'm giving high Kudos to Danielle and Office of Ruth Stroup for making my job so easy. I wish all my clients could be that easy!!! Thank you for the great service!! Ruth, you have a great employee, Danielle Renteria, and you are lucky to have her!</Review>

Tawny provided quick and efficient service when I needed to cancel my policy for my house when I moved.  Tawny told me exactly what I needed to provide and explained the process clearly.

Also, if you are a homeowner who rents in Oakland, I highly recommend Ruth Stroup's Farmers Insurance. This insurance organization seems to be the only one who understands the insurance coverage needs of landlords who live on their rental properties in Oakland. (I called many!)< /Review>

I want to thank you for letting us know about the uninsured motorist coverage available through our auto policy. You told us about it soon after I got out of the hospital at the end of January following a 2.5 month stay because of the injuries I sustained as a pedestrian. I was hit by a large vehicle being driven by an uninsured owner/driver. Today we got a call from Farmers to let me know that I was being awarded $500,000, the maximum amount under our policy. Some of that will undoubtedly go to cover  unreimbursed medical expenses, but one step at a time. I am doing well though will need to have follow up surgery in the fall.</Text>

After a swift records check, she notified us that the bill had already been paid. I very much appreciate her thoroughness and honesty. She sent us the payment confirmation as soon as the phone call ended so we could keep it for our records. Very helpful and smooth interaction.< /text></record>

Her energy is positive, she is incredibly informed, efficient, she gave me options, and I feel absolutely taken care of!

Thank you so much!!!

<Review>I had an issue with my mortgage company not having up to date insurance information and received a notice that my insurance was going to be canceled if payment wasn't made. When I called the office, Tawny gave me all the info I needed to get it straightened out with the mortgage company. Sadly, they didn't have their act together and needed more information than I could give. I gave Tawny a call back and she offered to call them directly, which she did and resolved the issue in mere minutes. A great experience and I appreciate her willingness to go above and beyond!< /Review>< user>

We needed the Mortgagee Clause updated on a client doing a refi. I emailed Ruth. She got back to me right away saying they will have it by tomorrow.
First thing Danielle had everything emailed to me the next day. That's great turn time for getting this done through a Insurance Agency. Especially when the average is about 3-4 days. Great working with them.

I have been with Ruth and Farmers for over a decade and the service is unparalleled. I often shoot a flurry of questions to Danielle Renteria about my vehicles, home insurance and life term coverage. Sometimes I just check-in to make sure I'm still getting the best prices and coverage and other times I have some life events that need immediate attention. I have never waited longer than a day for Danielle and Farmers to respond with a thorough and timely answer; most times, it's within an hour of me sending the email. Danielle has helped me strategize how to get the best coverage for my family while making sure I receive the best price quotes. Very happy customer!<//review>

I do all my many insurance policies through Ruth's shop.  I've been with her since we bought our first house and now have more policies than I can keep track of.  Fortunately, Ruth and her team take care of everything so I don't have to think about my insurance.  Our agent Odalis Ordonez just helped us with insurance on our new home during escrow and it was seamless.  Ruth is very connected with the community in Oakland which I like as well.<//review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>While we were abroad Ruth allowed our homeowners policy to lapse. We found out about it when we tried to file a claim for damages ($50,000!) caused by an Airbnb party. Ruth refused to file a claim, refused to send out an adjuster, and told us if we sent her descriptions and photos of the damage she wouldn’t look at them.
We became suspicious and contacted our carrier directly and learned that our policy had not been renewed by Ruth (as agreed) and that we had been totally uninsured for 7 months.
Ruth has never admitted to what happened and has not responded to communications from us or our attorney. We are now pursuing legal remedies.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Ruth and her team are a staple to our East Bay Community. She understands the value in giving back to local charities. Ruth truly cares about her relationships with her clients, is always a wonderful resource, and I know I can rely on her. It's not just about insurance (although she's a master at that) - it's about relationships.< /review>

Ruth Stroup is the real deal! Recently she went so far above and beyond that I had to add a review for her! Her commitment people in our local community is so inspiring, she is truly everywhere, known by all as the "Insurance Lady!"
It was only until recently we realized she has so much expert knowledge in areas well past simply home, auto, life, and business insurance. We've been discussing buying property in the extended Bay Area and she has such great insightful ideas to assist us. She even recommended a local lending company to help us get a strong pre-approval for a home. So, whenever we have an insurance and now even real estate questions or concerns, Ruth and her staff are our first call. Reach out to her team.
Gotta love Ruth the Insurance Lady!</Text>

Ruth Stroup farmers insurance is an amazing insurance company. They helped me insure a food truck event quickly and at a fair price. They have always been very response and on top of it they happen to donate generously to my daughter's public middle school. They truly are community minded and I urge others to check them out!< /review>

I've been a Farmers customer for over 15 years. My original agent retired and transferred my account to my current agent. That agent has literally not returned a phone call or email in over a year in my attempts to get a policy review and ask about other coverage(of course I still get the useless automated birthday and holiday cards in the mail).

Based on reviews I contacted Ruth who spent her lunch break on the phone with me going over my policy and questions. So far, so good! She then said she'd get back to me by email on a quote and also with a letter to sign so I can transfer agents.

A few weeks go by and nothing. Calls and emails are ignored. I suppose she decided I wasn't worth her time but a quick followup declining my business(with whatever excuse) would have been appreciated. More of my time wasted dealing with Farmers.

I will attempt to talk to another Farmers agent but if this happens again then I will have no choice but to take my business to a different company. Who's heard of paying for insurance but never being able to get a hold of your agent so they can try to sell you more? It's Kafkaesque.< /text>

Ruth and her team are simply top-notch and I can't recommend getting all your insurance needs taken care of through them enough.  Do yourself a favor and get covered with Ruth and team at Farmers in Oakland today - it feels really good knowing I am covered and if/when I need to call a REAL person will pick up the phone. Thanks for everything Ruth.<//text><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None<//pics>< Rating>

Ruth Stroup is a huge supporter of small indie businesses like myself and many of my friends and colleagues.

Ruth is a cornerstone of the Oakland business community.  If you don't know Ruth, you're not doing enough networking.  She's also an awesome cook, and insurance agent to boot!< /Review>

I have usually had very good luck here, this last time not so much. All they had was “tatemada” left and I asked flor 2 orders to go. When I get home it was mostly fat, very little meat. Very disappointing.<//review>

(Translated by Google) First and last time I go. They recommended it to me but I was disappointed, they served me pure broth and almost no meat, a very small portion and apart they charge the plastic container to take away and one more thing, we asked for goat birria and they gave me beef. I do not recommend it

(Original)
Primera y última vez que voy. Me la recomendaron pero me decepcionó, me sirvieron puro caldo y casi nada de carne , una porción muy pequeña y aparte te cobran el contenedor de plástico para llevar y una cosa más, pedimos birria de chivo y me dieron de res. No la recomiendo<//Text>

<Text>Dr Chen has been my dentist for
the past 6 years and I can’t say enough great things about her. She is so attentive and really cares about my dental health and does everything to make sure my treatment/ cleaning procedures are always top notch. I missed her during the pandemic and was so overjoyed to be reunited with her recently. Highly recommend. Did I mention I love her cheery and bubbly personality as well?</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1623522849100, 'text': 'Jayanthi, We appreciate the kind review and the 6 years of trust with your dental health.

<Name>fz zy< /Name><time>1604077111249</time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>I had my wisdom teeth extraction by Dr. Jennifer Chiang, the whole experience is absolutely amazing. Her local anesthesia was very effective to me and I didn't even feel a thing in the whole surgery. She extracted both of my upper wisdom teeth in one shot and the whole process took less than 20 mins.  Besides her dental skills/techniques, her communication made me very comfortable and greatly reduced the fear/pressure before/during surgery.

If you need someone to help you cope with a phobia of dentistry and receive a high quality dental treatment at the same time, she must be on the top-10 list in the south bay.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>So glad to have met Dr.Chiang! She and her staff are professionals who you can tell love their job and take pride in their work. They make sure I feel welcomed every time and it's always a pleasant experience. I really like her conservative approach to treatment and I can tell she genuinely cares about my oral health. Her office is also very high-tech. I recently visited her, and she had air purifiers, high vacs, air quality measuring device that read the air inside was cleaner than outside! Exceptional COVID safety protocol, felt extra safe being treated there. Highly recommend her for anyone looking for a dependable, life-long doctor!< /review>< name>

Dr. Jen is my go-to dentist.

She is attentive to every detail and is happy to answer any question you have. In fact, I think she rather enjoys answering questions about your care. I know she employs the latest equipment and techniques because she will discuss your treatment, what she uses, and why. Only the best from Dr. Jen.

She and her staff are constantly asking about your comfort. She is so personable and ready to strike up a conversation at a moments notice. We often share notes on the latest movies. She gets my "Certified Fresh" Rotten Tomatoes ranking.</text>

This entire staff was very friendly and welcoming. Both Elese and Dr. Chiang were very personable, and heart warming. Dr. Chiang took the extra time to address all of my concerns with my teeth, and gums, she was also very gentle and made sure that I was comfortable the entire time I was receiving my cleaning. I felt like I received the VIP dental treatment which is unheard of these days. I totally recommend this dental office. You will definitely be in good hands.<//text>

<review>First time doing a virtual consultation, but appreciated Dr. Chiang for her flexibility and accommodation for meeting online rather than in the office. Dr. Chiang was so child-friendly, and engaging. She felt safe and trustworthy, and simplified a lot of the conversation so my 7 year old could understand. I would highly recommend her to anyone, with or without children, but especially for children because it's a skill to be able to work with children. :)< /review>< user_id>

Dr. Jen and her team are amazing! Elese is always so warm and welcoming, it makes my dental experience so much more enjoyable. Jen is always attentive to my concerns and makes the extra effort to ensure everything feels ok before proceeding. She has taught me a lot about my teeth - how to floss properly, areas where I can brush better, and how to treat grinding teeth. They are also very covid prepared and I can tell they are diligently sanitizing everything. It made me feel very comfortable visiting during these times. Highly recommend her - she's the best dentist I've had!<//Review>

I’m so happy and really grateful that I came across Dr. Chiang and her staff! They immediately made me feel so welcomed and comfortable, I knew had found my new dental home right away. I had a bad experience at my last dental office that I had been going to for years and it seemed that Dr. Chiang intuitively knew that before I even explained the situation. Dr. Chiang is very communicative and attentive, she continually checked in with me during my X-rays and cleaning to make sure I was doing ok which I appreciated very much. She even went above and beyond to check in with me via email the day after I was there for my visit, super sweet! I also appreciate that she is eager and willing to answer any questions you might have in or outside of the office. Thanks again to Dr. Chiang, Esmerelda, and Elese, you ladies are all so sweet. I already referred my partner and she is looking forward to her visit since she knows she will be in great hands :)<//Text>

<Review>Thank you very much for your patience with my 5-year-old son, your softly-softly approach and multiple visits with incremental introductions of new processes really helped him warm up to getting his tooth being filled. My son is strong willed and determined. As parents, we encourage him to control his own path, with guidance. Once he determined what would happen and that he was comfortable with his understanding of what was about to happen, he allowed the process to continue. My son particularly responded well to the detailed, ‘kid-friendly’ analogies used to describe what was going to happen before proceeding with the work. The words you used were encouragingly structured so that he could alleviate his concerns. The accumulated effort lead to a perfect outcome!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>She is the dentist whom I met ever careful. She treats step-by-step with the patient and always tries to make a harmonic communication. I had have a panic disorder and been so scary about dental treatment. I have lots of fear for dental treatment so fat, but I can trust her after treatment of  wisdom teeth and decayed tooth. I definitely have no doubt everyone will be in her care during dental cleaning and relaxed with discussion and explanations from her. Also, I was surprised on her professional knowledge on biological background which helps me understand my current situation. Her skill is quite new fashion and sophisticated, so that dental care has been so sensitively cared. You will know that when you visit her.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<name>Benjamin Hsieh</name><Review>Dr. Chiang has been my dentist for over two years and I've received great treatment and care over that time. She recommended a night guard to treat my teeth grinding (which I didn't even know I was doing!) and I've noticed much less strain on my jaws and less tooth sensitivity in the areas I was grinding as well. As a regular nighttime nightguard wearer I've also started wearing them during the day occasionally as well for situations where I may be unknowingly grinding my teeth while working. It took some getting used to but now that I've been wearing it for more than  a year I hardly notice it at all.<//Review><UserId.>114666819967804680161< /UserId.><resp>{'time': 1607964741789, 'text': "Thanks so much for these kind words Benjamin!

I also admire the way she really listened to me and made sure she fully understood what had happened in the past regarding my teeth and dental care. Dr Chiang is a great teacher too - she held up a mirror so I could see exactly what she was referring to at any given moment. And - for the first time in my life, I now understand how to floss properly after realizing I’ve been doing it inadequately everyday for over 20 years. 🙈 I’m already looking forward to my next appointment with Dr Chiang!< /review><Response>{'time': 1611292613297, 'text': "So sweet, Gemma!

2019 - Dr. Jennifer Chiang is a really great dentist! She's been super patient with me and is helping me cope my phobia of dentistry. This is my second visit with her and I'm feeling much more confident each time I come in for cleaning. She makes me feel more comfortable and relearning that dentistry is not so bad after all. I'm so so grateful to be referred by my colleagues to her and I trust her more than ever. Thank you so much!

This is my first visit in 2021, Always satisfied with Dr. Jennifer Chiang and her staffs. Very welcoming and sweetest people. She's been working on my anxiety and it's getting better! Sooner or later, we won't have to rely on my anxiety medications for just cleaning! Thank you so much for the patience and dealing with someone with high anxiety like me!<//review>

Dr Chiang is the best dentist I have ever come across. Cheerful, extremely well organized and meticulous, very tech savvy, but above all, very very skillful. I have had two wisdom teeth extracted by Dr Chiang and both went smoothly, which is quite an accomplishment because I had a history of difficult extractions before her.<//Review>

< review>
I just had my second appointment with Dr. Chiang for deep cleaning and tooth extracting on the same side. She was super kind and answered all my questions with great patience. Plus she did thorough exam on my teeth condition and gave professional treatment advices. I felt minimum pain during the procedure and now recover well. Also, the process of making appointment is always quite smooth and I like the clear instruction I got for what I should do or know next. I would not hesitate for recommending Dr. Chiang to all my friends.</review>

<Review>I’ve been going to Dr. Chiang's office for a few years now and I’ve been very impressed with her service and staff.  I love it when I find people who are passionate about their craft and are continuing to apply new learnings and innovations to their practice.  In my last appointment for example, Dr. Chiang noticed I had canker-sores on my gums and walked me through an option to cauterize them to eliminate the nagging pain.  I went for it and I’m not going to lie - it stung for about 10 seconds after the application.  However, the short term pain was worth it because I felt glorious after the fact.   The canker-sore stopped hurting and healed quickly after.   This is probably one of the many tools Dr. Chiang has in her toolbox to provide her patients with excellent care and I recommend her to all my family and friends. Wish I found her sooner!<//Review>< Rating>

<Review>Dr. Chiang is SO knowledgeable and her passion for teeth and her patients' wellbeing clearly shows through ! I felt very safe getting my teeth cleaned during the pandemic. Her office makes you wait in your car to prevent multiple people waiting in the waiting room and they take your temperature when you first enter.

I've had some pretty complicated issues with my teeth in the past (multiple surgeries, gum grafts, etc) but  Dr. Chiang was very patient in understanding my full history, spent extra time looking at a tooth that had been irritating me, and was able to provide a great second opinion on a tooth I had a root canal on back in Chicago.</Review>< response>

I can’t say enough about Jennifer Chiang, DDS and team. Dr. Chiang demonstrates utmost professionalism and skill. Her team is welcoming, supportive and experienced. I always feel as though I’ve learned something about maintaining my dental health when I leave. Honestly, my teeth have never been healthier. If you need a great dentist and dental team in the Sunnyvale/Mountain View/Los Altos area, there is no need to look further.<//text>

< Review>
After a few years of putting off going to a dentist, I was eventually forced to go due to a particularly painful toothache. I was referred to Dr. Chiang and she was kind enough to immediately set me up with an emergency appointment.

At the appointment I was worried about what I might find out due to it being so many years since I've seen a dentist however, Dr. Chiang immediately put me at ease and focused on what could be done now and moving forward for the long-term health of my teeth. She took the time to explain in detail the steps, procedures and came up with a plan on how to restore my teeth back to their most healthy state. I was so grateful. Throughout the process she took the utmost care in making sure I was as comfortable as possible. The procedure was so smooth and painless.

The whole experience went better and beyond my expectations that it made me wish I had seen her earlier. Following the appointment, the healing process went without any complications which is a real testament to Dr. Chiang's skill.

I would strongly recommend Dr. Chiang to anyone looking for an amazing dentist. Dr. Chiang and her team are of the highest caliber. Extremely skilled, knowledgeable, kind, professional and truly cares about what is best for the patient.<//Review>

Dr. Chiang is extremely professional and provides unparalleled care for her patients. I have been going to Dr. Chiang for two years and I just brought my wife to her recently. My wife and I were afraid of dental visits but that has completely changed with Dr. Chiang. I had my deep cleaning done a while ago and it was way better than what I had imagined or people usually describe. I had minimal discomfort and recovered very quickly. Now I am really glad that I did it early because clean and healthy 🦷 bring me joy everyday!</Review>

<review>I have been a patient of Dr. Chiang's for 6 years now. Finding a dentist who is truly passionate about helping others and doing what is right is no easy feat. Many dentists do not take the time to get to know you, fully understand the problems you're experiencing, and share knowledge/research on best practices in dentistry. Dr. Chiang is, by far, the most ethical, honest, and skilled dentist I've ever had.

Dr. Chiang recently moved into her own office that is incredibly warm, inviting, and easy to access. Nestled in with many other doctor offices, the areas is quiet, charming, and relaxing. Even through all the COVID measures, Dr. Chiang's team is friendly, communicative, and timely in their responses to the evolving crisis. The office is equipped with an amazing air filtration system through the whole office and the team is in full PPE. There was not a single moment where I felt uncomfortable or concerned about my health (my last visit was on 7/25/20). They check your temperature with a super neat device that is contact free - how neat!

Dr. Chiang has helped me learn SO much about how to properly take care of my teeth (based on their unique characteristics). Dr. Chiang introduced me to a new floss, drTungs, that works SO MUCH BETTER than any other floss I've used (truth be told I was not much of a flosser before going to Dr. Chiang). I've recommended it to more than 20 of my friends who now all use the product too. Further, Dr. Chiang noticed my teeth have been wearing down over the years and diagnose my teeth grinding. Now I wear a night guard that helps protect my teeth from the chipping that was beginning to happen.

Lastly, I must name that I specifically travel from Concord, CA for my appointments with Dr. Chiang because of the excellence in service & care that I receive. Yes, that means driving over 2 hours with CA traffic at times, yet it's worth it. Luckily, Dr. Chiang operates on a few Saturdays each month to accommodate patients like me who have irregular schedules. I look forward to my visits because of how relaxing my experience is - half the time I am so zoned out that Dr. Chiang asks me if I am doing okay, haha.

The practice is growing, so I feel very fortunate to have cultivated a strong relationship with Dr. Chiang and the team. Thank you Dr. Chiang for bringing confidence to my smile :D< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlssoIjpjnxajRAh16aZMno4zgU_ootwWzwh4I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

<Review>My daughter (12) and I are long term patients and we love Dr. Jen and her cheerful staff.

During the COVID-19 pandemic and shelter in place order from mid March 2020 to June 2020, as much as I love Dr. Jen personally, I never thought I would say “I really missed going to the dentist”, (Although my daughter has always said “I love my dentist”).

I’m so happy that she opened back up this week (June 1, 2020) and she was able to see us.  I really missed going to the dentist, lol!

Rigorous protocols are in place to protect the patients and staff.  In addition to the extra PPE, physical barriers, and other policies that have been put into place, she has invested in additional suction equipment and a portable air filtration system for point of use.

Highly recommend, good for kids, COVID-19 protocols in place, see you in 6 months!</Review><name>Kelly Price</name><user_id>100373026805384078270<//user_id>< gmapID>

I went in for my cleaning this morning.
I have education in the medical field so I am very particular about infection risk. I am not an essential worker so though I have had low exposure risk, I feel very stressed about COVID and have been very careful. I only exercise in the morning, I clean my groceries and packages, and I wear a mask, cotton gloves, and glasses everywhere. I get delivery of most groceries.
I asked Dr. Chiang and Elise multiple questions about their infection protocol. They answered patiently by email.
They gave a special hepa filter for dental work. All staff wear PPE of gowns, double masks, face shields, and gloves. The staff put on masks before they enter the building. They have multiple sanitizer stations.
I waited in the car and called when I arrived. I was asked to come in masked. I was asked to wash my hands and demask only immediately before my procedure. I swished peroxide mouthwash for one minute. I then sat in the treatment chair. The special filter ran the whole time. After procedure, I re-masked and washed my hands and then paid at the front desk with Apple Pay. It all ran so smoothly.
Dr. Chiang runs a tight ship! I feel safe at this practice.</Review>

Short update to my past review:
Dr. Chiang and her team always deliver positive experiences and great results. I started the Invisalign process in the beginning of the pandemic. The process is easy and it's been going great. Dr. Chiang's virtual follow up definitely helped me stay on the right track when not visiting her in person.
Thank you for helping me find my natural healthy smile!

--------
Dr. Chiang is the best! She is so good that I brought my entire family to her. She explains every dental procedure and insurance coverage thoroughly in the most kind and friendly way. She is very talented and gentle at the same time!<//review>

<name>Andrew Waterhouse<//name><Time>1576176742140</Time><rate>5<//rate><Review>Dr. Chiang is So good....that I am actually looking forward to my next visit.  I need to have a couple things done but I am waiting until the new year when my insurance re ups again.
But I found myself wanting to get the work done sooner than later.  Dr. Chiang and her staff has taken away my fear of the Dentist.  I am 50 years old and I avoided the Dentist at all cost.  It is catching up to me and I need a lot done.  But Jennifer's style is very comforting, puts you at ease and is very skilled at what she does.  Very technical and her technique is flawless.
To actually want to go to the Dentist to get old cavities drilled out and to have new ones filled is remarkable.  The fact that I want to go to the Dentist is remarkable.  That is how good Dr. Jennifer Chiang is!  Thank you Jennifer!!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I can't say enough about how wonderful my experience has been with Dr. Chiang. I've been going to her office a little over a year now. She was able to diagnose my issues immediately when other dentists could not. She is extremely knowledgeable, professional and more importantly gentle. She is up to date on all treatments available and yes, always opts for the less intrusive treatment first. I had multiple issues going on and one by one she addressed them all. I am now pain free and my smile is looking better and better every day!! Her staff is pretty amazing too. I highly recommend her services for all your dental needs.< /Review>

Dr. Jen is the only dentist I trust! After being burned by other places, I stopped going to the dentist, but she has changed my mind.

If your looking for a painfree dental experience with no run ups! Look no further!< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Dr Chiang is very professional and nice. She and her stuff really care about patients. They explain things very clearly and let me know the situation and all the options, and help me pick the best one.

My previous dentist kept calling me for some non-emergent procedure, even though I told them I had run out of insurance coverage and wanted to wait till the next year. Then I started to see Dr Chiang because the calls from my previous dentist were annoying.

Dr Chiang did not apply the procedure (root canal) suggested by my previous dentist, but explained a lot of details to me and suggested to do a more conservative procedure instead. I appreciated she gave me two options and offered the conservative one. And they DONOT push their patients to have the procedure and pay the bill. They explained things and  let me make the decision about when and how.

Dr Chiang also speaks Chinese, which is very helpful for me because I don't understand some English medicine word.

I recommend Dr Chiang to everybody in the bay area.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>Customer service is amazing here and prices are very fair compared to other places I called. They fixed my iPhone 12 max pro screen in 20 mins, they also gave me a free screen protector. Definitely will be returning and referring people to this location. Thank you again!<//Text>< pics>

Took my tablet to get repair for LCD replacement, got it returned in 3 days; it was worse than it had before. whoever is doing their repairs needs to learn how to properly do repairs again. The home button on the device wasn't properly placed. The screen wasn't not inserted correct, as were the screen started popping off on its own after 3hrs of receiving it.

I took it back the next day, and they said they could fix it again so I left it with them for 2 days, and same issue and it had touch responds issues too.

Completely frustrating! I wouldn't recommend getting any device here repaired.  Good customer service but their repair services needs to be way better.

Look somewhere else to get it professionally repaired!<//Text>

Caesar has wonderful customer service skills! He's professional and fast in identifying what the problem was with my phone (bad charging port). He ordered the new replacement part and also changed out my screen. The whole process took less than 30 minutes and now I don't have to throw away hundreds of dollars on a new phone. Definitely would recommend trying out Easyifix if you guys need your phone or tablets fixed! Ask for Caesar!<//text>

Very impressed with Caesar's work--he is very knowledgeable and quickly diagnosed and fixed the problem on my I-phone  6S.  He is dedicated to doing quality work, and the price was very good.  Highly recommend!  Pete M.</Review>

<Text>Was told to leave my phone and come back in 40 minutes while they fix it. Left and came back and was told they didn’t have the part they need and to go back tomorrow. Extremely unprofessional to not even take my phone number down to call me and give me a heads up just in case anything happened. Going to a different location that does it for $10 cheaper.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1595290500678, 'text': 'We do apologize!

Came here today, had to get my screen fix and speaker sound was not working on my iphone 6. Caeser and staff there were very friendly and professional. First time here but I felt like i been here before, customer service was great. Would HIGHLY recommend to all family and friends. Phone was fixed in 15 minutes, the previous place i went to normally  took an hour and the prices are very good. This is my new spot to go when i need any kind of repair.<//Text>

went in for my phone that would not power up. Ceaser did a free diagnostic and had me out of there in no time. Gave me a free battery and tempered glass. He has definitely made a new customer for life. Highly recommend this place.</text>

<review>My iPhone has been through a lot, broken screen, mic and charging port were no longer working. A friend recommended this place after my phone finally stopped working altogether. Had I known about this place I would have brought my phone a lot sooner. GREAT PRICE AND SERVICE!!! Only 20 minutes and I left feeling like I had a brand new phone. Thank you Cesar!<//review>< GmapID>

<pics>None< /pics><text>I was beyond satisfied with the customer service and friendly atmosphere. My IPhone 6s Plus screen was fixed in a timely manner. The priceing of service, and accesories are great and affordable. If you happen to be a Metro PCS member And may also need to make some changes to your plan, etc., this location is also connected with a Metro PCS store witch makes it more convenient. Plus, there is a great shop right across from the store.
If you come to this location you will not be disatisfied. I will come back to this location if I ever need any services or accesories for my phone👍🏼</text>< Date>

I'm giving 3 stars to easyiFix because the finished service was rendered a month later.Quite unexpected,other than that very friendly customer service.
My Iphone 6s plus works now and I'm somewhat satisfied.</Review>

< review>
Spoke to owner (Cesar) had a question about unlocking my phone and instead of just taking the business and making a couple bucks on the unlock he provided me with a better solution that costed me nothing. Amazing customer service in my opinion and this was after reading ashish tanks review on the place but after my interaction i can tell either that it was an isolated incident or completely false..... i'm thinking the ladder of course.... Thanks Cesar!!!<//review>

This business owner is fake, beware of him. He may steal your money. Purchase a fire stick from OfferUp and I have a text message exchange. He said "no refund" and he also said "I don't care". He also sent text message that "l got your money you are screwed". And then he said LOL. Think before you trust this business owner. Many of those reviews are fake. He flat out says that he's not taking any responsibility for his product or service.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I had a bad experience with an employee, and Cesar was on vacation, as soon as Cesar found out about my bad experience, he contacted me, he apologized in person and I solved my problem !!! I recommend it 100% and if you have any bad treatment from the employees ask to speak with Cesar, satisfaction guaranteed

<text>I’ve been coming here since the pandemic started & I have had nothing less than excellent service every time. Dr. Desai, is always so welcoming & professional.I appreciate how he walks me through the entire process of what we are doing the day of my visit., that could be very helpful for people who have anxiety about the dentist. The rest of the staff is also very kind and welcoming & ready to greet you with a smile (even through the mask). I have never had to wait more than 2 mins after checking in to be escorted to my seat & get my appointment started. Today I was helped by Amanda and she was so kind & helpful while still being accurate and quick. They have been incredible with their COVID restrictions & have done everything in their power to make me feel safe. I would absolutely recommend this dental practice to my friends and family.<//text>< Pics>

I have been coming here for years! I could go to a closer dental office but I chose to come here for many reasons such as clean office, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and Dr. Desai being very thorough and precise with his work. Everyone here is so kind and I love to get my teeth cleaned here 🦷 going to the dentist was a very tedious experience but every since I came here I look forward to my appointments knowing my teeth health are in good hands!<//text>

What a dental experience this was. The second you walk in you know you are in good hands. The dental assistants were friendly and gentle. The dentist, Dr. Desai, was charismatic and accommodating, I would send any family member to smile brite and not batt and eye!</Review>

<text>I went to Dr Desai after a year of trying to solve a problem with my tooth with another dentist. It appeared after all the time, worry and expense, all I needed was a composite filling, which he took care of within the same short time I was there.
There is no waiting. Show up for your appointment, and in you go. He respects other people's time. He is soft spoken and gentle, and his offices are spotless. The music playing in the background is great, unlike the last dentist, which is a big plus for my husband, who will also be seeing Dr Desai now.
I left there feeling such relief that this problem was finally over, and grateful.<//text>< user_id>

<Review>I've been coming here for 20 years. Still, the best dentist in Orange County. They call you two weeks before with a friendly reminder and send you a text a couple days before to make sure you don't forget in your hectic schedule. When you show up, they get you in the chair on time. I actually even got in early on my last appointment. Amber did a great job making me feel comfortable and finishing up polishing my teeth.</Review>< Response>

<Text>There are a lot of things I like about Smile Brite Dental, their later hours make it easier to schedule appointments around my work schedule. The receptionist is knowledgeable about my insurance and is able to provide me with estimates for the cost of my next appointment. Dr. Desai is friendly listens to my concerns and doesn't talk my ear off when working. I recently convinced my wife to switch to Smile Brite. Also, they don't lecture me about my brushing habits, I got tired of other dentists doing that at every appointment.<//Text><Time>1523472741254<//Time>< pics>

<review>I have always had great experience when I go to smile Brite dental. Dr. Desai and his staff are always friendly kind and courteous. Whether it was a root canal, having fillings replaced,  or just a cleaning I have always had a good experience. I have never been a fan of the dentist but I would definitely recommend Dr. Desai at smile Bright dental to anyone looking for a new dentist. I drive all the way from Long Beach to Anaheim end it is definitely worth the drive.</review><Resp>None</Resp><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x80dd29c5edbcfe51:0x5569ea885970e4e7</gmap_id><user_name>Lydia Calderon</user_name><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

He is very conscientious of how you're doing and will make sure to check in on you often.  And the work is fantastic. My teeth and gums have never been healthier.

And all the assistants have the best attitude.  Very helpful and friendly!

<text>Dr. Naushi Desai and his staff from Smile Brite Dental in Anaheim are the very best. Am so happy with him as my dentist for the past 6 plus years. He is very gentle caring and will make time not only to talk about my visit but will always ask about my family too.Never hurries you. His staff too have been with him for all these years. He is the best and I recommend him. NO WAIT TIME. Very accomodating and Leslie with her welcoming smile is always there to make you feel welcome at the front desk when you check in.< /text>< Pics>

The strawberry mango banana sherbet was delicious. They have milkshakes, smoothies and ice cream cakes. You can also add any toppings into your ice cream. They have a new lucky charms ice cream and milkshake.
In this location you have to wait and make a line outside until the group in front of you has ordered and is out. That is a COVID safety practice here!< /Text>

My daughter wanted this for her bday dessert but the young guy working the door was rude and wouldn’t help us! He was sitting on his phone and refused to help with orders. Cold Stone ice cream is SOOO overpriced yet we were willing to pay the price until this experience. Never again. Owners really need to school their young staff on customer service!</Text>< pics>

Showed up with my kids to be told that they are only taking online orders. So dissapointing especially when the kids were looking forward to their ice creams. Will never go back there again.< /review>

<Text>The specialty Icecream was so yummy. The staff was great. The first one I met was new and apparently in training  but he had a great smile and attitude. The other who was training him was also great. I liked being able to taste the flavors before making a choice. Will definitely come again. Next cheat day that is.< /Text>< response>

Horrible experience the worker Devin was very unprofessional we arrived at Cold Stone  at 9:20 & he failed to tell us the store stops taking orders at 9:30. When we originally arrived it should have been mentioned. Poor communication which results in poor customer service.</review>

Kids working there have attitude. I understand they are younge but from a customer point of view it's not very pleasant. I experienced this multiple times so I'm not judging based on one visit only.<//Text>

<text>Called at 11am to confirm a cake pickup and the writing on it and was told it will be ready after 2pm. Got to the store at 4pm and the girl who greeted me after waiting in line had no clue where to check or anything and after getting the shift supervisor they told me they have to do the writing and it will be a few minutes. Once they asked me to pay and showed me the cake i couldn’t even read what was written on the cake, and when i asked the girl if she thinks the writing is okay she replied “well i can read it just fine”.  After 35 minutes from the time it was my turn i paid and left with another cake. Would not visit this location again! Worse experience ever! While i was waiting i noticed 2 of the staff hanging out in the back while only 1 person helping guests. It does not take 2 people to write on a cake...< /text>< rate>

Worst experience at a cold stone I’ve ever had. I’m 6 mo pregnant and was craving ice cream, so we came to this place and the line was close to the door. That however was not the problem, we waited 40min to be served and it was only one person taking orders and working cashier. Only ONE with a line almost out the door. The other guy was just cleaning in circles trying to avoid eye contact w customers. They need a better system, that was ridiculous and everyone in line was visibly frustrated not just me.<//Text>

<Review>Delicious, but quite expensive. Be prepared to spend $5 or more per person. Also, expect to wait in line for awhile. They don't have a public restroom, so have the kiddos go before you leave home.😥</Review>< Resp>

<Review>Cute little spot in Dogpatch. Unfortunately the food quality is not up to the design and interior of this place. Cappuccino was mediocre, pork belly way too salty, chicken avocado salad not memorable either.

It’s been a while since I’ve been and it sounds like maybe things changed a bit but when I went the pastries were inventive and tasty. I did find them a bit small and not very filling but there were also heartier options. The coffee was well made and there was nice seating outside in the sun. I’ve heard the ice cream is really good! (Weekends only I think)<//Text>

Nice spot for casual breakfast. Gets a little pricey if you're hungry, but good selection of hot breakfast, continental items, and pastries. Mix of casual inside and patio seating.</text>

The food was good. The service was a little slow. And the coffees were very weak. My latte didn’t seem to have any espresso in it. Not what I was expecting. Despite that, the food was colorful and tasty. The restaurant has a mixture of indoor and outdoor seating which is great for Brunch days!< /Text>

< Review>
Unfriendly staff, average food, 50% of tables needed wiping. First hint was it was 1/2 empty at 11:00 on a Saturday 🙄 (plus recent poor yelp reviews) This Place is a pass.

Update: 7/13/19 from 1⭐️ to 3⭐️
Thanks for the response and for the invite to return. We came back for a Saturday brunch. The service was vastly improved, friendly & inviting. We all found something on the expanded. The food still a 1⭐️, big Meh. Sorry we really wanted to love this place. It’s an amazing location & a great concept however .... for the price it’s not just worth it. Boiled potatoes passed off as fingerling fries, overcooked slightly old tasting burger, fried chicken salad w/ day-old fried thighs & brown wilted lettuce topped off with warm mimosas. Once again recommend a pass.< /Review>

The fried chicken salad was really tasty. I just wish they didn't have that DJ on Sundays though. I liked the more relaxed feel of Noon All Day back then.<//Text>

<Review>Very pricey, coffee is BITTERLY strong without tons of sugar and cream.  Not going to be a regular here - still, a nice outdoor seating area makes it a good place to meet friends for lunch.  Still need to work on their table service, very uneven.</Review><time>1567288009644</time></record>

Used to be in the four or five star range, but a recent trimming of the menu cut out some of our favorite small dishes. What's left isn't as creative — or as tasty. After months of making weekly visits, we'll likely look for a new Saturday morning tradition.<//text>

<text>UPDATE April 2019: Recently returned and was happy to find Noon open. A couple of weeks back it was closed at lunch. They did not answer the phone a day or two later. I thought they folded.

There was less on the menu than before. I chose The Burger, a strange choice in this place. It was quickly placed in the Top Three burgers of all time.

Deliberate. That's the word. This thing was constructed and assembled with purpose. Purpose being flavor and texture. The pattie at first appeared hyper shaped and cylindrical (like a frozen pattie) but it was the best part. As it should be right? Cooked just beyond rare, perfectly pink, not raw, and beefy tasting. Then the flavor road -first the cheese. Not sure what kind, but dairy umph and tang. Then the crunch of greens including sliced fennel for a garden blast. The jalapeños added some heat at the right time. A sauce seasoned just right. And the sesame bun pulled it together just before gulping down the bite. Yum. "It was like the chef put it together like this on purpose. Deliberate."

No squeezing out of sauce or toppings. No overly wide TMJ inducing height. Beef forward overall. Go try it.

And re: the reduced menu... As a fan of Kitchen Nightmares I take this of a sign of tight kitchen and restaurant management. They know what sells and what tastes good. Might be a communication issue to let customers know they are (or maybe are not) rotating the menu items regularly.

Go back and try it again. Enjoy a walk in the always sunny neighborhood.

So great to have Noon in the neighborhood! Love their hours as it can be hard to find something open midday! Was able to go to soft opening and try 4 incredible dishes and insanely good pastries. The location is great for UCSF mission bay folks!<//Review>

Not the place to go if you're actually hungry or want something with actual flavor. Minus one star for price. Minus two stars for portion size. Minus three stars for taste.</Review>

Trendy feeling cafe with indoor and outdoor seating, tucked in near the park in Dogpatch.  The cappuccino was top notch, the french toast and poached eggs were perfect, the pastries looked amazing, and the vibe was just right.  San Francisco's answer to Paris.< /text>

Prices are way too high for the portion you're getting. I ordered the plain breakfast and it was really bad. I couldn't eat it and there was no one to talk to.
I felt really bad for paying so much and not eating it as well.
Not recommended!</Review>

Noon All Day is a nourishing oasis, with food as comfy as a hug, prepared with such creativity and care.

The service is perfection - they anticipate your needs, bringing elevated service to a casual setting. Everyone there seems so thrilled to be a part of Noon!

Order a Sightglass coffee and a pastry - they are a must! Noon's croissants and danishes are creative & flavorful - complementary to their menu. I ordered the seasonal ricotta danish. A crisp buttery delight, with creamy herb ricotta. Many of their sweet pastries look like they are straight out of Marie Antoinette and they are surprisingly light, with many creative ways to cut the richness, and keep things on the lighter side.

The portions of their main dishes are perfect - large enough to satisfy, without feelin too full. I recommend ordering many plates to share so you can taste it all. (My favorites are the socca, the pocket sandwich, the nougat yogurt pistachio pastry, the scotch olives, their pickled veggies, and all of their essentials to add to any dish). Noon is a great place to order a variety of small and big items for sharing, whether that be for brunch, a mid-afternoon snack, or a dinner date. (You can add a poached egg to anything on the menu, for brunch too!)

You need to visit this gem of a restaurant, see for yourself.

PS Noon is the ultimate location to take some Twin Peaks pictures (their tile looks similar to the Black Lodge flooring.)</review>

< review>
i love this place!  My favorite Mongolian restaurant is 80 miles away, so this place stepped up and i am grateful.  I can understand why the cooks are not smiling --- it is too hot in that enclave - you can feel the heat radiating at the entrance.  I hope you install electric fans there for your cooks and the diners.< /review>

1st time that I tried this place and it was awesome and delish! So you can order either a regular bowl, superbowl or combo (which is a regular bowl + rice &drink). You order your meat then add whatever veggies you want, you pick your choice of sauce then they add the noodle and grill it. I cant believe how much food there was. The styrofoam box was overflowing. The only downside is there were only 3 people in the whole foodchain. The cashier who also preps your food, the chef, and another guy inside who refills the food outside as needed. A little slow service for a place when its busy. But either way, the mongolian food but worth the wait!</review>

I have to say, this is my favorite quick food. You get to chose what you want in your bowl, and there is no limit. They cook the food right in front of you, so you know it is fresh. The chef adds water and the sauce of your choice while cooking to keep it nice and moist. The food is served to you hot and scrumptious. Every time I go to the mall I skip Panda and go straight here!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Where are all these four- and five- star reviews coming from? This place is awful, it never has any customers even during peak hours, and pretty much the same unfriendly people work there from 20 years ago. Makes you wonder how they stay in business in a prime space in this mall, with no customers yet weirdly positive reviews...</Text>

The cashier with red here is fantastic! She's attentive, professional and all over friendly. The cookie staff is also very kind. I come here for my lunch break and it's always great. 4 stars because there's always room for improvement.< /text>

I just don’t see myself returning to this place . I ate here 3 times now and every time I gone I throw away my food because it taste gross . I am not sure who will like this food place. They need new management and get entirely new ingredients.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Food is good, considering you make it yourself, including sauces. However, they close at 9 and kick you out at 8:15pm. I get wanting to go home, but to interrupt someone's dinner to throw you out, absolutely ridiculous.</Text>

Super good food.  They need to put the sign back up that tells you what sauce to use.  This time I had to guess and the cook didn't want to talk to me.  It was bland...<//text>

I love eating here. If you serve yourself right, one bowl can feed four people. I love the noodles, and all of the different ways to flavor your food and make it delicious. My favorite thing is that you create a bowl of food that you created, and fits your tastes perfectly.< /Text>

The food was good.. it was our 1st time at this spot. We were used to serving ur own veggies n meats and they poor in the sauces and noodles.. i felt like the ladies where just watchibg how much food i was graving... it was a And little uncomfortable. And must i add i didnt know how much to measure the  Teriyaki and garlic sauce I added too much 😖..<//review>

This place is okay. When I heard that there was a Mongolian Grill in the area I got excited and went there right away. To my disappointment it is NOT a typical Mongolian Grill. The toppings are skimpy, so are the sauces. The noodles are not typical egg noodles. And they charge top dollar for only 1 bowl, where as most Mongolian Grills are all-you-can-eat with a drink for $9.95. If you want a one bowl with rice and a drink be prepared to spend $11. All that said, if you need a fix of Mongolian food and cannot travel far, this place will suffice until they bring a solid franchise to the area.</Text>

<Review>I spoke briefly with staff on the phone, inquiring about an RV. The staff member had what I felt was an abrupt and unwelcoming phone personality - giving short responses, and not having any pleasantness in his tone. I felt as though I was inconveniencing him by speaking with him or asking any questions.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Just brought my Aliner Camper into Neil’s for a couple repairs before we embarked on the second leg of our cross country trip.  I was in and out on two separate days within hours.  They did an excellent job on the plumbing fix I needed and they fixed a battery power issue within minutes.

Tony and Walter in service were excellent.  The prices were very reasonable and I was able to pick up a bunch of additional parts that I needed from their parts store.</text><Name>Christopher Naoum< /Name><Resp>None</Resp><user>112954067293727606381</user></record>

I just bought a  1994 Fleetwood prowler. I am in the midst of remodelling it and upgrading interior. It was in great condition.  I just wanted to make it even better. I know little to nothing about campers so I am in the learning stages. I was actually referred to niels by someone who got parts here over 10 years ago and said they were knowledgeable and helpful. So I took a drive over after calling parts and explaining what I needed (30 feet of T molding) over the phone I was told to bring a sample. 2 gentlemen were in parts the 1st gentleman was short and rude Pretty much an expansion of how he was on the phone. He had a negative attitude in my needs like it was a bother to even help me. There were other items I was inquiring about. So the other gentleman offered his assistance and was very helpful. In the end I walked out as a customer and business they lossed before they even began. I was basically told by salesman #1 to leave an open credit card for an order that would never be confirmed with an amount because supposedly Fleetwood would never confirm the cost of mailing the parts. I found this to be absurd and on the level of fraud. To request a customer leaving an open credit card for business to charge whatever they wanted and be told there would absolutely be no refund I could not legitimise the gentleman's argument. There just seems to be a lack of transparency, honesty or integrity in this situation and circumstances. So I walked out a frustrated and unhappy customer.  The next day I then of course called Fleetwood, who also said leaving a credit card open as I explained, sounded fishy. Noting Fleetwood would definitely give a price on shipping before finalising a sale.
In today's climate integrity is everything. Campers and RVs are investment  You want to know somebody is not ripping you off.</text>

My wife and I were shopping for our first camping trailer. We stopped in to Niels after making an online inquiry. I was thoroughly impressed by Nick's experience and advice. He was a great person to work with. He was honest about what we could tow with our small SUV (3500lbs towing). He didn't try to lie or upsell us into anything. It was the best shopping experience for a vehicle I've ever had. I'd honestly pay more to get that kind of experience, than have to deal with dishonesty and deception. It's unfortunate that they didn't have a smaller unit in stock or we would have made a purchase there. I'd without a doubt recommend Niel's RV for anyone else looking.</review>

< Review>
We met with Nick and he did an AWESOME job showing us the trailers we were interested in purchasing. Absolutely NO PRESSURE SALES. Great selection of different sizes and models.

As I was picking up our new trailer, they had cleaned it and we’re going through intricate workings of it. They assisted with the weight distribution hitch and it’s setup.

I would recommend Niels RV to anyone that is interested in an RV.

Talk to Nick, he’s your man!< /Review>

Nick, you are the best. everyone at Niel's was very kind and friendly, highly recommend them.< /review></record>

<Review>Simply stated, these people get the job done!

I had the usual apprehensions regarding large item purchases and brought them with me.  The business side of this transaction was, we felt, fair and equitable.
The salesman, Rodney was excellent with his understanding of my wishes AND follow-up in the service area dealing with translating those wishes and getting them implemented in a timely manner. That coupled with with Mike (Service Manager) who worked closely to ensure his knowledageble and seasoned crew understood the tasks amazed me. This group does understand customer service and works accordingly.

I really appreciated the extra effort taken by Mike to "know" my equipment enhancements so as to only install every upgrade I brought to the table with customer satisfaction his main focus.

Did I mention I am VERY PLEASED with this transaction, I am!< /Review><Rating>5</Rating><Response>{'time': 1503428322784, 'text': "We're more than glad to hear that our team took great care of you and, we truly appreciate you taking the time to give us such great feedback!"}< /Response><user_name>James Beck< /user_name>< GmapID>

We just purchased an RV from Niel’s RV and it was the best experience we have had in car buying in many years. They made us feel comfortable, they were attentive to all our needs and answered all of our questions without feeling pressured into buying the coach. Once we decided to buy the coach they walked us through everything and even made a house call that very next day, no questions asked, to check on one of my concerns. Of course it turned out to be nothing as I am simply a newbie RV driver but they were there to help with smiles on the face.

If you are in the market for an RV I truly highly recommend Niel’s RV as they not only have a great selection, they provide the whole experience and make you feel like family.

Nick, Jeff, Garrett, Rodney and the whole Niel’s RV staff- > Thank you again for the GREAT experience and our new RV J

Yet I believe there is a misunderstanding of the details of the charge. As you know a motorhome battery system has many factors involved, and a van conversion that has had solar panels install and a refrigerator that quit working right after that, as your unit has,  takes time for the tech to look at it and see what is causing the battery to die. To just say the battery is dead and to sell you a new battery does not necessarily do a customer justice if the problem is not fixed. If the problem is not fixed the new battery will be dead again over time and the problem will still exist. I am sorry you do not feel that diagnosing an issue is worth the money but to tell someone just replace a battery is not proper.'}</resp><gmap_id>0x80c290b9c488fb63:0x8ff70b0496440a6e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Did not go in for service, but called the service department for advice. Needed to fix/replace a fuse (super breaker) that connected the power from the front battery to charge the rear battery. This then provides power to the entire unit. Mario was extremely helpful and offered advice that fixed the issue. Definitely worth giving these guys a call :)< /review>

<review>Just went in and was really looking forward to buying a trailer, but the owner took the wind right out of my sails with his lack of customer service and overall politeness. They had the trailer we wanted but they will now never have our business. I do have to say Ernie was the man and was so polite and knowledgable. The owner needs to take some lessons from Ernie.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>We had a family member in from out of town and decided on Jane for dinner . We didn't have a reservation and had a very short wait in front before being seated maybe 10 min .  Service was excellent, as well as the food. I would give more stars if I could.  I highly recommend.< /review>< user_name>

We visit Jane quite often for good food and a pleasant environment. The bar is good, with a sure hand and eye producing fine cocktails.
On this occasion though, it became apparent that there were a few flaws.  I had the veal marsala and my wife had the special Hawaiian swordfish.  Whilst both were tasty, the basic flavors of the meat and fish were completely shrouded by the sauces.  My veal could have been almost any light meat, the swordfish any firm fish. As I said, tasty, but a bit of a let down.
The desert, a semi-freddo with caramel was delicious,  but not a semi-fredo.
We'll go back, but without great expectations.</text>

<Name>Mccauley Rocha<//Name><UserId.>110635643184041676815<//UserId.><Review>Though my experience at Jane at the Marketplace has been mostly positive, today in celebration of my sister's birthday...I have a few exceptions.
First of all I must say that our server, Catherine did a very good job. She was cheery, and informative. Ditto the dude in charge running the front end.
I have always liked the environment here: big space, cloth napery and good quality glass and cutlery. A mid priced  restaurant with the class to fill the space with touches that make a difference in our overall enjoyment.
There were 4 of us today and we ordered:
Med Pizza
Blackened plank Salmon with french fries and Mango/Citrus coulis
Turkey Cobb with Gorgonzola
Red Onion Rings
Coconut Cake
Last time here i ordered the (i assume) Special Pizza which was a pretty spectacular Prosciutto, Mushrooms on a white, cheese sauce. A very delicious item. (i've attached a photo of this pizza to this review along with the Med pizza)
This Med Pizza was a major disappointment. The crust was lifeless and tasteless and was an odd tan color: as it it were whole wheat which it doesn't seem to be based on the menu description. Something was off with this dough: not leavened enough? Leavened too much?
The Buffalo Mozz was good but there just wasn't enough Olive tapenade to make an impression. Worst of all, the greens were dry when they should have been dressed. Even dressed with just olive oil, salt and pepper. Where was the Balsamic?
My sister very much enjoyed the Salmon and found the Mango/Citrus  sauce a tasty accompaniment to the fish. The Salmon was of excellent quality and grilled as ordered. A very good dish.
The Turkey Cobb was good: all of the accoutrements were prepared very well though the Gorgonzola pieces were ridiculously big. Odd to be sure. Also the Turkey was good: obviously not deli turkey but either bought or cooked in house. The greens were crispy and fresh.
The Firestone Red Onion Rings are once again pretty perfect: light, well seasoned batter but also fried very very well. This item is a prime example of a simple dish elevated to ultra goodness because all of the pieces are handled with care and in a careful, thoughtful manner.
The Coconut Cake arrived with a candle which was unlit and no one from the staff to sing Happy Birthday. Huh? a 200 buck lunch ($50 check average for each of us 4) and no one could spare the time?
Despite that, this cake is as coco-nutty as you can get. The cake itself was tender, fluffy and redolent of coconut . Both the buttercream and filling were delicious. The portion of cake sits in a milk-style sauce jam packed with coconut flavor. No artificial coconut "extracts" in sight or in the taste of this cake!
I can see  why people love this item.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

We had dinner here and we're very surprised with the quality and taste of our dishes. We started with their salmon pancake which is exactly what it sounds like and it was awesome. It has smoked salmon, goat cheese, a pancake base, and caviar roe. For dinner I had chicken with capers, lemon sauce, fettuccini. Wife had a seafood medley style soup. We shared a gluten free chocolate cake which was dense and very sweet.
The prices were completely reasonable, especially for the quality. The ambiance was nice as well. We sat out on the covered patio with heaters. This is a good place for a family too. We will definitely be coming back.<//review>

Service was great, prompt, and friendly. Drinks were fine. The food was not good. The kitchen made some odd, bland choices. We got the mushroom pizza that I really didn't like, which is odd considering I like anything that has mushrooms on it. The quality of ingredients wasn't the problem - I just felt like the kitchen didn't know what food was.<//text>

I am from out of town. Jane at marketplace was recommended to me, so I tried it  that time of year is wonderful. the staff was very nice and the service was excellent. I had the fish and chips and they were very greasy and there was something bitter in the fish flavor.  I noticed several other males what did look very good.  however I won't be able to try any other dishes I think it's worth a try< /review>

I have had the chicken picatta TWICE it was so good! I don't know what other reviewers are talking about. My wife had the baked Alaskan Halibut- awesome! Service was excellent. Wine pours could be a bit more generous, but lots of local restaurants are a little stingy in that regard. We will be going back !< /Text>

Enjoyed brunch here this morning. Very very good. Atmosphere was pleasant, servers were polite and attentive. Food was outstanding. We started with the eggplant pate & olive tepanade which was incredible. I had the Frenchy omelette, perfect and the scalloped potatoes were very good. My wife had the chilequiles, and with the tomatilla sauce. She enjoyed them very much . The coconut cake with vanilla sauce to finish was the perfect way to wrap it up. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience there andand absolutely reccomend this place well.< /Review>

On this visit, I ordered the Grilled Chicken plate for dinner. It was absolutely delicious. It had a light cream sauce that was delicate and complimented the Anaheim chiles and chicken. The roasted potato side had so much flavor, I could have easily eaten 10 more servings. For dessert, I had the pecan tart, which had just the right level of sweetness. The service is excellent as well, I’d highly recommend eating here!</Text>< GmapID>

< Review>
Jane has become our "Friday night" dining special restaurant.  My sister usually orders goat cheese pancakes and I love chicken piccata with lemon caper sauce.  Recently I substituted scalloped potatoes for pasta..wow, I love the way Jane does potatoes.  We usually arrive before 5:30 so we can get in on the happy hour options.  When we leave the place is packed and there's a line out the door.

I highly recommend Jane for the food, service, and ambience.</Review>

<Text>The burgers here are absolutely amazing. Great flavor and variety. I haven't tried their appetizers yet, but they have a large, varied selection to choose from. The location is nice, with a beautiful patio. Service is generally very good, but we have had a few experiences of having to wait a long time for follow-up twists like drink refills, the check, etc. I would highly recommend this place of you are looking for fresh, high quality food and a generally great experience.< /Text><rate>4< /rate>< Response>

The people are nice and the place is cute, but the food was mediocre at best.  We seriously waited about 45 minutes for the food to come out and when it did the recommended steak frites were well done when we ordered medium rare.  I would not go again.</text>

Normally fantastic, but tonight my chicken picatta was like rubber. I could barely get a knife through it. Otherwise it is good. To be fair this has been my only bad experience out of about 10 visits.<//review>

Granted we should have asked but we brought her requested family cake and was informed that the restaurant had their own pastry chef and there would be a $20 charge if we wanted to consume the cake we had brought at the restaurant.  I returned my cake to the car and thought we would make the best of it without our family cake!  Unfortunately, our experience did not improve when our dinner was served.  The food was very mediocre.  The pizza was tough and greasy, the pork sandwich was fatty and the filet was the caliber one would expect from a chain restaurant. There was no recognition of our granddaughters birthday from the restaurant,  not even a scoop of vanilla ice cream! $225 later we went home and enjoyed our traditional birthday cake. Would not recommend Jane based on our experience!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>don"t order the cold sparse crab lunch salad. the large piece of warm salmon salad would have been great. should have sent mine back. skimpy and too much dressing. the prices on their web site are way off too. not $19 but $23 for hardly any substance in my plate. i may go back but not for the meal I chose. expected the choices to all be good. oh well live & learn.</Text></record>

This is a good choice if you are in the Goleta area.  We shared the oysters to start, and for the main courses we had the flank steak in chimichurri sauce and the mixed seafood and vegetable stew in coconut cream broth. All were excellent. The wine list was very good, in fact it was better than at a more expensive restaurant we dined at off State Street in downtown SB.<//Text>

The food was good not great. I had the smoked salmon and prawn salad. The service was not good at all. We sat there waiting to be acknowledged but the server waited the 15 minutes for the happy hour to end even though the pair of ladies next to me ordered off the happy hour menu. It was disappointing.</review>

The few times that I went, the food did not live up to the downtown location. Everything is just a little off. For example, the chicken picatta is tasty but super greasy and the burgers were good, but since they were out of buns, we ate them on ciabatta.

Service is pleasant in the restaurant, but when we tried to plan a private party there, the communication was terrible, and I felt we were treated badly and blamed for things that weren’t communicated to us properly. Fortunately, we had a mountain of email evidence that proved it wasn’t our fault, and only then did they become apologetic. It was ultimately resolved to our (somewhat) satisfaction, but I was disappointed in the customer service overall.</text>

One of the best happy hours in town.  Lunch and dinner here are fantastic.  The pizza and greek salad are highly recommended. Great service too.  Highly recommended by a SB/Goleta local.</text>

I feel badly writing this because I've always been fond of this restaurant, however last Friday I was turned down at the door because they could not accommodate my baby in his stroller. The patio was closed due to the fire and they had a private party in the other room, however there were tables available in the main room and the hostess turned us away. I feel this is definitely a form of discrimination.</text>

<review>This is the second inedible meal I've had at Jane. I had the fresh fish sandwich. It was not fresh! Coated with so much mayonnaise and butter I couldn't taste the fish. It made me feel sick to eat that much mayonnaise. I told the waitress and only ate 2 bites but they didn't adjust the bill at all. Not impressed.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Michael at Andrew's furniture did an outstanding job showing us various couches to accommodate our needs. They have a large selection of beautiful furniture to choose from. He was very patient, professional  and very personable. For that, we are forever grateful.<//review>

This is the best place to buy furnitures from. I came back for my second set of sofa here. Michael, the owner is an excellent guy, very customer friendly.
They have a huge collection to fit all budgets and the prices are unbeatable.< /Review>

<Text>I buy ALL my furniture from here because I love the amount of selection I have to choose from.  They make themselves available for questions and there response time was always quick.  I changed my mind ALOT and it never bothered him because he genuinely wants you happy making a purchase from them.  I tell everyone to go to Andrews for furniture because they won't be disapointed.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809b202216801d33:0x6a167ee3cf54085a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>An outstanding experience from start to finish. The website is very informative, Michael in the showroom even more so. We ordered our ensemble Wed and were sleeping on it Sat after free delivery which was on time. The boys delivering and installing were friendly and professional. The mattress is quality and the price thousands under what some of the bedding retailer are charging like for like. Well done Michael. It is great to see a local manufacturer showing it can still be done if you are top of your game.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Amazing customer service really listens and helps direct you to what you want and aren’t pushy. The quality is the best I’ve seen, just like they used to make it in the old days. The guys have me an excellent price for me and another time for my cousin. Once I got the wrong size and they even came to exchange it no problems. Such a good team<//text>

We just purchased a mattress after debating the investment for some time and contemplating on all the choices on the market today. The customer service and help at Andrew's Furniture and Mattress, Michael was amazing. We are so excited for our new bed! Thank you for all the expert advice and knowledge shared. I recommend anyone in the market for a new mattress to visit this store.</Review>

I walked in and was immediately greeted by a wonderful guy named Michael. He was very helpful, he let me experience each mattress and was very well versed on every product in the store. I left with exactly what I came for! A wonderful mattress at a wonderful price. I would recommend this location to anyone!</Text>

I found a headboard that I liked and asked about the price; Michael gave a very fair price on the piece and when I explained that I needed it delivered before my move on Saturday he called the warehouse and arranged to have the headboard delivered the same day. Michael couldn't have made the transaction easier!  I'll be happy to recommend anyone to Andrew's after my experience today.< /review>< Pictures>

Fantastic service! We had considered Mauricio and Kevin as we needed a bed quickly. We were able to walk into the showroom on a Sunday, choose a bed and it was promptly delivered by Mauricio, Kevin two hours later. Where else can you get that kind of service? To top it off the mattress is fantastic quality. Thanks to the team at Andrew's Furniture and Mattress for going above and beyond.<//text>

I explained I had a stiff neck. Michael asked for details on my current pillow and how I slept then gave me several pillows to try and further adjusted them for firmness and height. Very happy with my new pillow. Nice, friendly family-run business.< /Review>

I was very impressed with their showroom facility. They have a good variety of Mattresses neatly displayed in a large private, air-conditioned showroom area, which made for a perfect testing environment. They were also very accommodating, allowing me to spend a long time trying out different Mattresses in peace.  By far the best showroom experience I've had.< /review>

We went to get a mattress for our son, and Mauricio became his best friend immediately.  he was incredibly friendly and somehow was able to get opinions from a child.  he shared her recommendations with us, staying within our budget while acknowledging how long a kid's bed would last as he grows.  He _loves_ the mattress and has been sleeping fantastically!</Text>

Most amazing place ever and the best customer service one could ask for. We had previously bought a mattress (which is still in excellent condition after 4y) and some amazing gel pillows. I recently re-bought the pillows for my parents and the team went above and beyond to get them to me. It's rare to still get this kind of service and I am so glad businesses like this still exist out there!</text>

The store was very professional and courteous to us. The staff talked but we didn't feel pressured on buying anything. We had a thorough demonstration of their products and was very helpful in deciding what we bought. We came back the next day and purchased the items we chose. This store is highly recommended for anyone buying a high end mattress set.</Review>

Went in to replace an old coil mattress. Michael met us just inside with a friendly welcome. I voiced a couple concerns I had and he showed us a few options that put those concerns to rest.  With his friendliness and knowledge we were confident in the mattress and adjustable bed we purchased.   Will return soon to purchase our sons mattress as well.<//review>

<Text>Michael was exceptional!  My wife and I both have very different needs out of a mattress, she like soft, I like firm.  We didn’t want to go the split king route, so he showed us different mattresses that fit our needs.  We ended up choosing a purple mattress and couldn’t be more excited!

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Bought a mattress set from Andrew's Furniture and Mattress. today. He was very helpful and knowledgeable without pressuring us to buy. We felt like we got a good deal and free delivery/haul away was the cherry on top. We were very happy with the service and the inventory at Kevin. I would definitely go back to purchase more in the future!<//Review>< Pics>

Kevin was fantastic! When we walked in, he came up, understood what we wanted, and showed us a range of options. He then helped us decide what would be best for us and gave us a great deal. Everything was delivered on time and as promised. We went to this store thirteen years ago when we last needed a mattress and also had a great experience. It was the first place we thought of going back to.<//Review>

We found a unique sofa set that had mill-end fabric that was awesome! One of a kind. Michael was great... helped with the 5 year fabric protection and very knowledgeable.< /text>

<Review>Jaime was extremely helpful. He taught us about the difference between the different types of mattresses and the between a protector and pad. He also told us the best way to ensure that we qualified for the warranty too. He was fair on the price and willing to work with our budget. Highly recommended!<//Review><date>1590474919733< /date><resp>None<//resp>< rating>

<text>I've never had such a customised experience. The folks here are attentive and take their time to help you figure out exactly what you want. We were re-stuffing our Mattress. They sent me home with a variety of samples for my family to try so we could figure out what would be most comfortable for all family members. I highly recommend.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Most amazing place ever and the best customer service one could ask for. We had previously bought a mattress (which is still in excellent condition after 4y) and some amazing gel pillows. I recently re-bought the pillows for my parents and the team went above and beyond to get them to me. It's rare to still get this kind of service and I am so glad businesses like this still exist out there!</review>< pics>

Don't judge a book by its cover. The showroom from the outside does not look like anything special, but don't let that stop you. Extremely comfortable mattress and great customer service. We bought a king size mattress that needed to go up to the third story of our home. The delivery team managed this with no issues.< /Review>

<text>I got new Mattress for a previously very uncomfortable couch, and now it's so comfy! Mauricio spent time explaining all the different options I had and letting me actually test all of them out as well. They won't try to convince you to get the most expensive option but will rather help you figure out what's best for your needs at your stage of life. This was a wonderful experience!<//text>< Pics>

<text>It's been like 10 years since I bought a new bed. I went into there location and was greeted by a lady named Sunny she was extremely helpful should me a verity of beds in my price range.  He asked me a lot of questions about what I didn't like about my old bed and from that information directed me to the bed I bought.  All I can say is I'm sleeping like I did when I was a teenager again.  Fantastic experience! I highly recommend Kevin.<//text>< pics>

<Text>My daughter was missing some bolts from her loft bed. The manufacturer is no longer in business and I had no way to get replacements. I went in to Andrew's in hopes that they could help me out...and Michael did! He found me the bolts I needed and didn't even charge me! This is definitely a business I would be happy to patronize when I am in the market for new furniture or mattresses! THANKS SO MUCH!< /Text>< pictures>

Go here if you want to thoroughly understand your mattress purchase and feel confident that you're getting your money's worth. We learned a ton from Michael, who is an exceptional and patient salesman. We'd definitely shop here again.< /Text>

<review>Michael was super helpful when picking out a mattress for my son. He was straight to the point and stayed within our budget. We got a queen bed with a box spring. He was very knowledgeable in the various beds in the store. We will definitely come back when we are ready to buy our king bed.<//review>< rating>

James was an amazing sales associate!! He made this experience 5 stars for our family. He was kind, easy-going, and took his time with us. We ended up purchasing an Aireloom mattress and look forward to this mattress lasting a long time. Sleep is worth the investment. You must ask for James the next time you walk into Mancini's in Andrew's Furniture and Mattress!<//Text>

I was helped by Michael and had the best experience. I was pretty intimidated and nervous to make such a big purchase, but Michael was very patient and helpful. He answered all of my questions and made sure I got exactly what I needed/wanted. I went in on a Friday night right before closing, and he scheduled my mattress to be delivered, set-up, and my old mattress to be taken away on that Sunday! Incredible service, thank you!< /review>

<review>Michael was awesome to work with and explained the differences between the mattresses, bed frames, and box springs.  We ended up getting a soft mattress and love it!  I almost ordered the medium online but I'm so glad that we stopped in to try it out.  I highly recommend coming to shop and seeing Emmanuel if you're in the market for a mattress!!< /review></record>

The idea of unfolding your mattress and watch it fluff up is a joy of another kind. To top that, the great quality and comfort of the mattress is just the thing you need to get a good night’s sleep or sneak in those afternoon naps. They don’t make it easy for you to leave the bed just there, the pillows are like hugging a baby. Good luck trying to get to work on time :)< /Text>

We worked with Andrew's to buy a new mattress and mattress set. We went to Sleep Train before going and I am glad we did! He worked with us to find the right fit and even found one that fit relatively in our budget. They have great furniture and picked matching night stands. Overall wonderful experience and I can't wait until it's delivered! Ask for Kevin!</Text>

Just left Andrew's Furniture and Mattress and had one of the most painless and greatest mattress shopping experience I've ever had. We went in and told our Salesman Michael what my wife and I liked and within 15 min we were sold on a great set. He gave us different options within our price and knew exactly what to show us so we are both happy. Thanks, Michael!<//Text>

<Text>I received very positive experience with Jaime. We really enjoy our new bed. Jaime was very friendly and knowledgable. He was a great help picking out the right bed for us out of the huge selection available. What a difference having a power adjustable bed over a regular flat one. I will come again and now I got very smooth as silk. Thanks to all.< /Text>< Name>

The mattress is extremely comfortable and the price was incredible! I wouldn’t hesitate to buy from these guys. There has been zero hassle, easy to use the website. All items are explained perfectly.

We had the best experience with Michael the second we walked in. He acknowledged us right away and took us under his wing. We were not sure what we wanted exactly but we felt comfortable with him because he was informative on each product. Go see Michael and get the best experience.<//Text>

<review>Purchasing a new mattress is a big deal and a purchase you don't do every day. So, you need to have the best salesperson walk you through your purchase so that it is a pleasurable experience. I would only go see Kevin. He is the best, friendly and knowledgeable, a joy to work with. You will be very happy you did.</review><Gmap_id>0x809b202216801d33:0x6a167ee3cf54085a</Gmap_id>< name>

<Review>I have to say this is the place to go if you want knowledgeable, courteous, friendly, honest salespeople. Michael Dennis greeted me, answered all my questions, allowed me to take my time and showed me exactly what I was looking for by understanding what I did or didn't like about this or that bed. I should have listened to my wife and looked here first.<//Review>< pictures>

Looking for a mattress...  Michael was very professional, courteous, and accommodating. He was very knowledgeable about the differences between the mattresses. He asked questions to know which mattress would be best for us. Without being high pressure, he was successful in selling us a new mattress and headboard. Very pleased.< /text>

My mattress was going bad for a couple of months ago and needed to purchase a new one.  Michael was friendly and patient. He really knows his products, able to answer all my questions, and gives me enough time to try all the bedding in the store. I would definitely recommend him!< /review>

I ordered an Ashley sectional and matching ottoman from a "furniture outlet" in Davis on July 5th, 2020. The guy there said it would be at least 3 weeks and up to 3 months for delivery due to COVID, etc. Almost 3 months pass before I got my initial delivery date... I was told it would be another week or so. My second delivery date was October 5th. When I called October 4th to confirm delivery for the next day, he offered the opposite-facing chaise and in a different color if I still wanted delivery on October 5th. If not, the delivery date would need to be pushed out to the end of October. He also offered a full refund to cancel it. I decided to go ahead and cancel yesterday (October 6th) and scramble to find a reasonably priced sectional, one that I actually liked, that was also available in warehouse to be delivered before I have my whole family over October 10th for a party. Imagine my frustration at this point...

I shopped around a bit on October 5th and didn't really find anything I liked enough and was ready to give up and wait out this next delivery date. My boyfriend had purchased a couch from Andrew's a while back and told me to just give them a call to see if they could help. I called October 6th and I got an answer from Michael even though they were closed that day. Michael told me to call back tomorrow (today) to check if they have the Ashley sectional I had originally ordered from the first place. I called back today, an hour before they opened, and Michael answered again. He immediately checked the warehouse, and low and behold, they had it in stock! With the matching ottoman! We immediately set up payment, he then set up same-day delivery, and within a matter of 2 hours, I had my sectional and ottoman delivered and assembled in my home. Unmatched customer service from Michael, and very very nice delivery guys. I'll only be shopping here for furniture in the future, and I'm plugging them to all my friends, family, and coworkers. I'm still in shock!<//text>

Michael helped me to collect the perfect mattress. We had just checked out a different location and sampled a mattress we liked, but due to all the reviews. We decided to take a look here before buying. I would like to give him full stars for great service.</Review>

I went into the store and was immediately met by a very knowledgeable salesperson, Jaime who is also the manager, He listened to my needs and help me select an appropriate mattress.  That was about 1:30 pm, by 3:45 pm that same day the mattress was delivered and the old mattress and springs remove by two polite clean uniformed delivery men. I could not ask for a better purchasing experience.< /text>

Kevin was so amazing. I am moving into my new house on Saturday and was in dire need of a bed. He helped me stay in my price range and get me exactly what I wanted. I walked in and walked out in under 30 minutes, no hassle. I recommend this Andrew's to anyone!< /text>

< Review>
We bought several pieces from Andrew's Furniture and Mattress when we bought our house several years ago.  They are all excellent quality and have stood the test of time and four young boys.  We just completed a renovation and went to Andrew's Furniture and Mattress.  The pieces are just as amazing as their store, but the outlet has AMAZING prices and staff just as helpful and accommodating as the store.  I've got my eye on a few chairs to add to our collection!!</Review>

We purchased a mattress, sheets, comforter and pillow and we absolutely love all items we purchased. I am a chiropractor and struggles recommending beds for patients, and this by far blows them all out of the water. Highly recommended!< /text>

Just purchased mattress there.  This is the 5th bed we have purchased at this store. The manager, Kevin, was excellent to work with.  Kevin, who schedules delivery was incredibly accommodating with my delivery time.   Great product and first class customer service.</text>

I went to Furniture very long time and finally, I found this company with my Andrews who just moved to Winnipeg and was looking to furnish her new apartment.  Andrew's had a large selection of couches and dining tables that were really reasonably priced.  I would happy with them.</Review>

Wonderful purchase and I am very happy. The base is very attractive and matches the room decor very well indeed. The support it gives me is fantastic. The bed/base was easy to install. Thank you all very much.</Review>

Nice furniture, decent prices, many items are in stock so you can buy & take home same day. The staff is super friendly, very helpful and patient too (which is great for those of us who are very indecisive).</Text>

Had to stop here to get information on warranty exchange. The store wouldn't get anything for the helpful information. The manager and a clerk were so great in helping my husband and I make the right choice. This store was the place where we had gotten the mattress set 6 years ago.  Only place to purchase mattress items</Text>

Happy with our quality Mattress.(don’t believe the hype about the Sleeping Duck- had to return the Duck, not comfy, soft, made me sore).  But Andrew's Furniture and Mattress is right for us and sleeping much better. Hip pain is gone :)</Review>

We purchased a large sectional sofa and bedroom set from Andrew's Furniture. Although the furniture looked good initially, it has worn poorly over time. Jaime positions themselves as having good quality products but doesn't be fooled!</text>

Everything with Andrew's is perfect. Ordering is full star, customer service is full star. The mattress My only regret is I didn't buy it sooner. I have been sleeping on it for about 10 months and it's still fantastic.</review>

<Review>Excellent experience in store and mattress is fantastic.  We love it and have been sleeping well since.  The classic 8 has been great.  I woke up in pain every day prior to purchasing this mattress.  The only mistake we made was not buying it sooner.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Pics>

I needed a CA King mattress and after 3 different stores ended up here as I have bought from them before. Most mattress stores you have usually jumped on from the salespeople but not this place was a good experience  Go see Michael, he wasn't pushy and very patient, will buy from him again.<//Review>

That was a fantastic and positive experience! The staff friendly store representative. I went to the loading dock at the back and the Michael there had the item in his arms loaded it into the car. I always got a perfect service and product from this store.<//Review>

Andrew's was a delight to work with. He patiently showed me his selection of mattresses and helped me order a sleeper sofa I had my eye on. While my order hasn't been delivered just yet, I have no doubt the excellent service will continue through delivery and installation. I would definitely recommend.</Text>

Came here because our friends referred us. Walked in and immediately found our bed! They have anything from modern styles to older looks. Great choices and fast service. Staff was very meticulous and thorough with everything. Plus the prices are unbeatable! Easiest purchase my husband and I ever made!</Review>

< Review>
Was looking for a Cal King bed with my wife on Sunday 4/28/19 - We went into this shop on a whim and were greeted almost immediately by a staff member named Mauricio (I hope I've got his name right!) - He was unbelievably helpful and very patient as we tested different mattress types. He also went over payment types, and really put forth an effort to connect to his customers with non-work talk while he crunched numbers. He quickly coordinated delivery of a bed set, and was willing to work with us on delivery as well. Would absolutely recommend to friends and family alike.</Review>

<Review>Was looking for a Cal King bed with my wife on Sunday 4/28/19 - We went into this shop on a whim and were greeted almost immediately by a staff member named Mauricio (I hope I've got his name right!) - He was unbelievably helpful and very patient as we tested different mattress types. He also went over payment types, and really put forth an effort to connect to his customers with non-work talk while he crunched numbers. He quickly coordinated delivery of a bed set, and was willing to work with us on delivery as well. Would absolutely recommend to friends and family alike.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Well, I would like to say,  I have been to a few bed shops around Roseville today and the service I got from this gentleman was outstanding. Mauricio helped me find what I was looking for and I'm happy to say my new bed is coming Friday would recommend to anyone who wants good honest service and reliable bed, Mauricio and other employee is too good and very responsible.</Review>

<review>Love my Furniture.  I did a super custom Furniture and I actually bought my own fabric from the fabric store.  Andrew's has a huge range but I was looking for something really unique.  They put it together exactly as I requested.  It is super comfortable and looks amazing.</review>< Pictures>

The best furniture store anywhere, my wife and I went to lots of furniture stores and we didn't find anything we could agree on. We stepped foot into here and we told the associate what we are looking for, he took us there and we both looked at each other and went "perfect!" Then we furnished the rest of our house.<//review>

My father is very happy with the mattress as his back pain has gone completely. He was having back pain from a very long time as he was using a memory foam mattress then the doctor suggested to change the mattress. We did and here he is very happy with the Company! Thanks to Michael.</text>

Great service and selection! They're a large store but it's more of a ma & pa business. The employees were very helpful in giving me all the options in my (very low) price range and explaining the benefits of each. Very pleasant experience. They even had a busy delivery schedule, so when they had to delay my delivery one of the employees used his personal truck to being over and set up my furniture after hours! I'm in college and this was my first time buying a real bed (that's not a cheap futon), so I really appreciated the assistance they were able to provide. Also, if you're trying to completely furnish a house / apartment, I noticed they have all these really great 5 and 7 - piece living room & bedroom set deals that are cost efficient and have the option of low monthly payments. Would recommend!<//Review>

We have been going to Andrew's furniture for all of our furniture. He has given us the best prices all year round beating promotional prices around Sacramento and Roseville. Delivery was quick and awesome. My mom who lives in Modesto, which is about two hours from Roseville, drove all the way to Andrew's to buy everything for her living room. She was impressed by the quality of the furniture and the prices. Great customer service is their middle name. Thank you Andrew!<//Review>

Such awesome customer service!  I was extremely impressed with the customer service at both Andrews stores I visited. I initially went to the Lichen store and then was directed to the Roseville store. Both sales professionals were very attentive and asked questions to better assist me and my family. In the end I left very happy with my purchase, a table with 6chairs and a day bed/trundle with mattresses. I will definitely be going here for my furniture purchases again.<//Text>

I came to this shop and Michael helped me, I was not aware that there is a 4 day body scanner that can measure your pressure points and recommend the right mattress. What a breeze narrowing down the selection.<//Review>

I contacted Andrew's as our office's custom rooftop patio furniture needed a facelift. After communicating via email, he quickly hopped on the phone with me and walked me through all of my options as well as sent over his list of recommendations but I can tell him Works are top notch at what they do.< /Review>

I am excited for Andrew's Furniture's new store in Roseville. I have been their loyal customer for a few years now at their Citrus Heights location.  Excellent customer service, impressive product knowledge, and good quality furniture at reasonable prices. This is my go-to shop for all my furniture and mattress needs. I refer all my family and friends here, and i am sure you will too :)</review>

Beautiful furniture and good prices! They moved in to the spot where big lots used to be. Outside looks bland, but inside of the store is surprisingly nice. Prices are definitely hard to beat. Lots of selections and no sleezy salesman!< /review>

Just recently was shopping for a king sized bedframe for my girlfriend and I. Stumbled upon this place and saved me a trip to the headache that is IKEA. Mike was awesome. We got exactly what we wanted at a fair price. Showed up a full week early and he was able to arrange the delivery that same day for us. Great experience and will be back for any other furniture purchases!<//text>

Beautiful furniture and good prices! They moved in to the spot where big lots used to be. Outside looks bland, but inside of the store is surprisingly nice. Prices are definitely hard to beat. Lots of selections and no sleezy salesman!</review>

When I moved to my apartment few years ago, I bought all my furnitures here! Michael is helpful & gave us the best deal ever!!! Delivery & set up was quick & easy.  My Husband & I Just bought our first home & we definitely went back here to get new furnitures. We’re satisfied as always & loving our new place & furnitures. THE BEST EVER!!!</text>

<user>109628792710297292296< /user><username>Kimberly Russell</username><Date>1523776052535< /Date><rating>1</rating><review>Unfortunately, I am a dissatisfied customer and I would have preferred a different outcome. Although I see that others have had a 5-star experience my experience was very disappointing and this is why: I purchased a sleeper sofa paid in full & was given a delivery window of 1 week. All of this was on point & accurate. It was later after I agreed to the evening delivery on 4/13 that the customer service drastically went from Good to Bad. Upon entering my home I was told the sleeper wouldn't clear the doorway to the room. Despite this statement being made, without my consent & an explanation of THE FOLLOWING WAS NEVER STATED: "If we unwrap the sleeper, remove the legs, cushions, bed, etc. It will be your responsibility to pay a restocking fee for the merchandise if we are unable to fit it through the door that we've already stated it won't fit through. In addition we will just say it isn't our fault. We don't measure anything & you owe us a delivery fee & a restocking fee which is 20 -25% of my purchase. Remember, I have no product, less money, & no options were given to meet my needs or incentives to regain my confidence in the company being a reputable business because the dollar signs appeared to take precedence over the need to build customer relationship, loyalty, & customer satisfaction. Andrew's Furniture #EpicFail #ImNotHappy
GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE means helping customers efficiently, in a friendly manner. It's essential to be able to handle issues for customers and do your best to ensure they are satisfied. Providing good service is one of the most important things that can set your business apart from the others of its kind.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1523907078256, 'text': "Hi, thanks for giving us the opportunity to service your needs. As stated in our sales policy on the invoice at the time of sale, lines # 3 and 4 explain the return policy. We had even summarized the terms and conditions before payment was made. Restocking fee was going to be charged whether the packaging was unwrapped or not because the 190 lb piece was already delivered upstairs, but the piece was refused. The measurements of the doorway into the bedroom as well as there being a wall about 3 feet in front of the doorway was never disclosed to us, let alone letting us know that the sleeper sofa is going into a bedroom instead of the living room. And quite frankly, when we were blamed for not asking about measurements before the delivery, that seems very unreasonable. We try our best to work with our customers to reach an amicable solution when problems arise. The customer is not always right, and Andrew's Furniture is not always right either. However, when customers have unreal expectations or our effort and due diligence has been disrespectfully dismissed, we will end a relationship with the customer. We wish things had worked out for all of us, and we are sorry it did not. We do wish you the best in getting the color, product, price, and service that meets your expectation. Thank you!"}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809b202216801d33:0x6a167ee3cf54085a</Gmap_id></record>

Every time I shop around at rc willey or american furniture galleries thinking they have good deals, I come back to Andrew's Furniture after all my shopping is done anyway. This family operated store doesn't shower me with all that salesman shenanigans,
and their service is exceptional. Im very impressed with how much this family business has to offer. Very happy to see they have expanded their business that I've been furnishing I am a customer for life.</review>< time>

Andrew's Furniture has done it again. Every time I shop around at rc willey or american furniture galleries thinking they have good deals, I come back to Andrew's Furniture after all my shopping is done anyway. This family operated store doesn't shower me with all that salesman shenanigans,
and their service is exceptional. Im very impressed with how much this family business has to offer. Very happy to see they have expanded their business that I've been furnishing I am a customer for life.<//Text>
