<response>None<//response><text>I really don't like having to stand there waiting to get in. In the old days I would just leave my money on the counter sign in and be on my way without having to wait on anybody. Now they hide the sign in sheet and are in no hurry to check you in. Prices aren't that great, a lot of things aren't much cheaper than a new part and some parts are actually cheaper to buy new. These days I only go for the oddball parts that are hard to find online but then I get reamed on the price because the things I buy aren't on their stupid price chart.<//text></record></dataset><record>

If you go to the website you can se what cars are there before you arrive. If you can find your car on the website look for similar makes and models on the website. Every car i found on website is there, and occasionally i find one that wasn't.</review>

<Text>I go there all the time. They are always courteous and helpful. Even though I lost my $400 phone there the other day. They have been keeping an eye out for it. And I've searched everywhere. To no avail. But it's ok. I bought another one today. But being an auto mechanic? I work on many different cars all the time. And when I go, I'm usually looking for and/or pulling parts for several cars at a time. So note to self? Leave your phone in your vehicle when you go. It's easy to loose. Great work though. Fun place to learn too. Rather than tear your vehicle up replacing the part? Go here to take one apart first. So you know how it works and is assembled. Then go work on yours. Just a tip</Text>< Pics>

The prices are good. The staff service is good enough. I did not like being given a key to match to a tire that didn't fit my car though. Now I have this tire I can never use because refunds are in store credit only. No thank you.</Review>

<text>I come here often as it is the only pull your own parts lot in Chico, and their prices aren't terrible and they usually have what I'm looking for. Now for the reason for my poor rating. I recently sold them my vehicle because it was beyond totalled between the failing transmission, bad catalytic converter, busted wheel bearing, heavy power steering leak, among other things. I divulged all of this when selling them my vehicle and oddly enough they offered me more in store versus their online valuation. So I was happy with that, but after going back multiple times recently I discovered they are selling my car as a "builder" car for way more than they paid for it. I asked them about my old car, not knowing I was the previous owner, and they said they don't know what's wrong with it and is being sold as is...for almost 10 times what they paid for it. I watched the woman take notes as I described the issues the vehicle had when I sold it to them, so they in fact DO know what is wrong with their builder cars, they just won't tell you before you waste your money on those broken cars. Super shady.</text><Rating>2< /Rating><user_name>Twilly Spree</user_name>< time>

Is it okay place. I've been coming here for 20 years, since they opened as Chico Self Serve.

They try to keep their prices comparable with eBay and AutoZone now days on a lot of things.

God forbid you take off your muzzle when you are at least 50 feet away from the nearest person.

I went in there a couple weeks ago. When I got out to the yard and away from anybody else, I had the audacity to lower my mask.

This shrill sounding Karen came running out to the yard hollering at people "SIR,  I need you to put on your mask!!", even if they were 50 feet away from anybody else.

She even saw some people underneath of vehicle working.  She went to the vehicle,  crouched down to do a mask check,  got right into their face within 4 feet and demanded that they put their masks on, breaking social distancing rules.

This mask policy has been selectively enforced. I have seen employees walking out to the yard without a mask on and nothing was said.

I also noticed that this person only made that demand to white people but totally ignored people of other races.

This is also the only Pick-n-Pull that I have ever been to where the employees go out to the yard and start chasing people down to screech at them when they simply lower their masks to catch a breath of fresh air while they are 50 feet away from the nearest person.

All the other ones that I have been to just follow the CDC guidelines that say wear it when social distancing is not possible<//text>

This place is a joke. No organization, no communication and no idea of what they're doing. We had a 4-hour window which they missed by an hour, and when they did show up, had no idea about what we had discussed at length on the phone. Just donate to goodwill. It isn't worth the effort.< /Text>

I recently bought a used vehicle and I've been sourcing parts from this Pick-n-Pull the customer service is is not what you would expect it to be the pricing on some of these parts are outrageous and the experience of the people that work there tells me that they have not been in the automotive parts of service business or any amount of time after my last visit a couple days ago I made a decision that I'm just going to be going somewhere else to get my parts spent way too much money probably over $1,000 in the last month or so then I bring a part back for a return and they won't take it this for days over there 30-day policy.<//text>

<review>Incredibly unprofessional and don’t stick to their word. They made ZERO efforts to call me when they came to get the car and then got frustrated with me when I asked why they didn’t call because they told me they would. Unless you have an entire day to sit around waiting on them to show up don’t sell them your car.<//review>< pics>

I love the place it's easy for finding the things I don't want to pay outrageous parts prices for. However customer service sucks. They claim to have loaner tools all which are some sockets and a busted wrench or two. They close at six pm but refuse entry starting at five.< /Review>

Pick-n-pull started back when I was just a young adult.... I am disappointed that the companies change has lost its entirety of integrity in what truly used parts are worth !!!!! A part that may last a few days or months is NOT I MEAN NOT WORTH THE 1/2 AND 3/4 PRICE OF A NEW PART...!!!
THE BUSINESS WILL NOT BE AROUND MUCH LONGER IF THEY CONTINUE TO BE GREEDY.!!!!!!</text>

Pros - 1. Clean yard. 2. A posted price list to save waiting in line just to find out. 3. A small portable hand-wash station.

Cons - 1. Overpriced everything (radio, fender, seat, whatever). 2. $2 just to look. 3. Staff doesn't appear to like anyone. And I am actually a shopper who despises all that forced fake pointless courtesy found at Home Depot, Safeway or just about anywhere these days. Annoying pestering employees bombarding me with dopey queries about how I am doing today. None of your stinking business, that's how I'm doing. But when asking questions, it would be nice to feel understood and perhaps a wee bit appreciated.< /text>

They had a pretty good setup here, first time here and my first time seeing row numbers on the cars, usually it's a big guess and tons of searching. Another first time for me, the part was easily accessible and a quick pull!< /Review>

< Review>
The Chico location picked my car up on October 1st, and it is now November 16th. I have not received the agreed upon payment yet, even though they said t would only take 2-3 weeks from pick up. I have called their corporate number twice now, this morning being the latest call. The person who helped me said that the car is still not checked in, but is sitting in their parking lot. They essentially broke their contract and stole a car. I would not sell your used cars to them, as you probably won’t even get paid for them. You are better off selling the car to someone else who can use them for parts. I will never use Pick and Pull again.<//Review>

This place was a complete mess- no organization at all and employees were not helpful & didn't even attempt answer my questions. Also, the cherry on the top- the guy at the front desk shorted me $20 - on my change. I gave him a $100 bill & my total was $56.... he gave me $24 as my change!!! I was in a hurry which is why he probably took advantage in the first place so I didn't notice till I was home... There with the receipt was $24 wadded up... I guess it's my bad for not double checking it and assuming people ( especially people in his position) would be honest....

Also like I said the prices for some of the stuff here is kinda steep again they're not really being as cost-competitive with some of the other products you can purchase from Amazon so I'm kind of leery about going here anymore cuz it's kind of hard to find a good deal but they do have lots of good parts and they always have a fresh election a car so that's a good thing</Review><gmapID>0x8083289ef676898f:0x13e731c183093b23</gmapID>< name>

Unbelievable.... In such a hurry to go home at 426 pm when the business closes at 5 p.m. the inter door was locked and they were unable to help me due to it being 426 p.m..... Horrible experience with the lazy crew on duty..<//Review>

Easy access from the street and it's  a walkin only meaning no public vehicles allowed in. It's  an easy access for searching for the vehicle from which you choose to pick parts from. Its self service-pick your vehicle and pull the psrts you need.<//review>

Prices are kinda high, but that is to be expected with a chain like this. Best selection in the area and being able to look up inventory and pricing online first is a plus.</review>

Customer Svc. is bad. They do not help you at all. I was going to buy a pair of speakers and they tried to charge more than they were new. You pick you pull, you're supposed to save some money. Bad experience all around. Wasted 20 in gas just going there. The better self serve dismantler is in Oroville.</Review>

And hope they have the battery in stock, there are times when their selection is limited, call ahead and see when they restock the inventory. There is a charge for a core, $12.99 plus tax, either bring your old battery in or bring it back later. Total cost $62 minus core refund ≈ $48.

If you live in the Tri Delta area and are looking for a professional very good quality hair salon without the crazy outrageous prices give Latinos hair salon a call. I promise you you will not be sorry. The salon is located in a sort of sketchy neighborhood the however it's worth the trip over there because you will not be sorry with the results when you walk out of that salon. All of the stylists are very skilled they take time to get to know their clients and they give great advice they will not steer you into some crazy hair color that doesn't match your skin tone. My stylist is Ingrid and I would recommend her to anyone. But any of the stylist at Latinos will do a great job I have not seen one person walk out of there with a bad haircut or bad hairstyle and talk about hair color the color wrist at this Salon know what they're doing and you won't be sitting there all day long either. So for your next hairstyle or haircut give Latinos hair salon a try you won't be sorry.< /text>

<text>I love going here. Everybody is very friendly and they all do a great job when it comes to make their customers happy. Especially my personal favorite Andrea. Love the work done to my hair.

<Text>Patty is awesome! Both times I've been to her, I've gone in not knowing what I wanted done, & each time she's made me feel like she did exactly what I wanted! Great availability, they take their time, but don't keep you there for hours. I've also gotten my makeup done by Diana & a gentleman (didn't catch his name) did my hair (5 mini-cornrows on the side with the rest done in curls). Very happy every time I leave. Definitely my forever salon!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I can't say enough good things about Patty Mendoza. She is fabulous make up artist.  She has done my make up for photo shoots and special events.  Patty also does my Mani/pedicures.  I schedule her at the same time I get my hair colored by Renee.

Renee is an expert at hair color and specializes in Latin hair.  Renee is extremely reasonable and actually does your hair (not an assistant)!  This very important to me!  If you want to look fabulous,  book an appointment with both of them today!</text>

<user>115349853004219635784</user><rating>1< /rating><Review>I saw in several reviews how people would give great reviews about Renee and decided to give her a try. Went and showed her what I wanted and ended up with something else. My brother was even making fun of the fact that I showed him what I wanted my hair to look like and ended up with a different color and look from desired even thoughit wasn't want I asked for, it didn't look bad. But not what I asked for. I read how she takes time and listens to you and give suggestions. No not with me. Since I liked the first out come even though not what I wanted I decided to go back but she seems always in a rush and this time she even had other people help her with my hair. Again asked for a specific hair color and end result was not what I asked for. Color did not pair well with my skin color. My mother said it looked like the red a lot of old people but in their hair to color the grey and my face looked way to red for that color. I did not ask for a red hair color or brassy hair color either. The grey hairs on my head were not covered. So expensive and not worth paying for. Not coming back here again. I can understand if they think a look is not going to sit well on you because of your hair, skin color,etc. But for that you talk to your client and explain to them what you can or can't do that gives that person room to decide if they should stay and give your suggestions a try or walk out. It's not just here that you go in asking for a specific hair cut or hair color and they end up doing what they want. It's so hard to find a hairdresser to actually do what you ask for. And if they can't do it because of hair or skin they should at least make the best effort to make you look good not just throw in a color or hair cut just to have you sit there and make money. Best of luck to Renee she may really be good at what she does but not unfortunately my two experiences with her were not the best of her expertise.</Review>< Name>

i used to go when they were located at sycamore, I did not know they moved to 18th street until I found out for a friend, I am really happy to find them, I got one of my best experiences today, their customer service is excellent I got lucky to meet Ramiro, he explained in detail what he was doing to my hair, and I left very very happy!!!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Wow you were super happy with my change of look at the beginning if I was a little scared because I thought how I was going to be especially mind because I was going to paint a man but that impressed I want to recommend 100 if they are going to be a change in his hair that go with Ramiro Hawthorn exactly as I wanted and imagined thanks to him for his excellent work I found my favorite place. Thank you very much Ramiro and I really love it.

Due to work I travel extensively, and haven't found a single barber that does the job like Joe. He's absolutely never let me down, and I walk out feeling like a million bucks. It's worth the wait for the appointment. Thanks again Joe.</review>

Great barber but it’s appointments only. Ok, I understand that.

He took my name and number and said he would give me a call back about when his next available appointment will be.

It’s been almost a month and he never called back. I don’t think he even took my information. I called him a few times since then. All I got was his answering machine saying he had no appointments available.

Not a very good way to keep customers if we have to hunt down a barber.<//review>

After going to every barber in town my choice for haircuts will always be Joe's. With affordable prices and a variety of choices you can't go wrong for the visit. The atmosphere of sports, music, or conversations with Joe adds to the experience. If you live in the area or are passing through give Joe a call to set up an appointment.< /text>

Joe's an awesome barber. He does a great job cutting my hair(what I still have left).
I always have an entertaining time chatting with him about sports and stuff.

Best cut in town! Excellent atmosphere. Joe is a one-man show so he goes by appointment only but I’ve never had an issue...Even when I call the morning of, I can get an appointment that day or get a call back if he has a cancellation. If you want a sharp haircut for a special occasion or even just every day, this is the place.</text>

Joe is the only barber, so it goes by appointment, but I've never had an issue getting an appointment. He does great work, when there for about 3 years before I left for work.< /Review>

Joe has only delivered outstanding haircuts! Great prices, Fresh Haircuts! Has valuable customer service! Recommended to anyone looking for a reliable, well priced haircut. I've been going the past 2 years and even though I live in Victorville, I still come out because he is THAT GOOD! Thank you Joe for your service!<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Very impressed!  Needed my hair cut and randomly picked Joe's barber. Super clean, nothing but positivity coming out of this chop shop. Joe is professional and more than a barber, this joint was beat down...everything in it Joe rebuilt, he laid the floors, put up paint, to many things to mention, my point... Joe owns this shop and runs a tight ship. the second you step inside Joe's barber and the door closes behind you, you're transported to any five star barber joint chop shop in the world, I've had my hair cut in 16 different countries. After Joe finished with the haircut he topped it off with true barber poise and a little bit of straight razor to give that super smooth look and feel. Told him I'd be back. He has a rapport with his clients , makes them feel comfortable, and relaxed. Thanks Joe.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1504311443645, 'text': 'Thank you.'}< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c47ca25336e951:0xded771ba90df02a0< /gmap_id></record>

Joe is the only person I go to, when you call to make an appointment he does it according to my schedule. So if I need something after 4 he does it or earlier
But if you want something earlier then I suggest calling early. He is in high demand.</review>

<review>I have been getting my hair cut at Joe's barber shop for over 10 years. Now he cuts my 3 year son's hair aswell he got his first haircut at Joe's. I wouldn't trust anyone else but Joe. His barbershop only gets better he is always adding new furniture and equipment guy really cares about his shop. You can tell he takes pride in his shop and the hair cuts he gives one of the best barbers and barber shop.</review><userid>106589203974436400327</userid><gmapID>0x80c47ca25336e951:0xded771ba90df02a0<//gmapID><user_name>Leo Garcia</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Showed up a few minutes late. Barber was professional, clean environment with great decor, and entertaining shows on screen. Couldn't ask for more.
As for the haircut, you can tell the barber took his job seriously.  Knew exactly what needed to be done. Medium fade all around with slight touch up on top.</Review>

<Text>I came in and he said I had to make an appt. I set one for 2 hrs later and got a clean zero - 2 high fade and it came out clean. Barstow is run down but this place was pretty legit. If I'm in town I'll be back. God bless you Joe.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate><name>Brandon Gonzales</name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Stopped in for a cut since I was working away from home.  Was the second customer thru the door when it opened.  Had to wait almost two hours while other people were called and asked if they wanted a hair cut!!  Then the quality was pity full.  Don't waste your time or money on this shop.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1496761997805, 'text': 'You must have reviewed the wrong barber shop.I go by appointments.

Doesn't get any better then this Barbershop! Family owned, great customer service, crazy clean, and professional. It also has the best atmosphere! Sports memorabilia and TV'S everwhere.The barber there definitely knows his stuff, perfect haircuts everytime. Our family never goes anywhere else. We drive 40 min every time my husband or son needs a haircut and it's totally worth it!<//review>

This is a modern day barber shop committed to customer service . Makes Appointments, free WF-FI, accepts credit cards, posts pictures of quality of hair cuts and newly remodeled. This is what I expect of today's barber shop.</Review>

If I could give it zero I would and looking back at the reviews from the last I’m not the only one.

THIS PLACE IS AWFUL! The rudest staff I’ve ever encountered and they have zero care for how they talk in front of customers let alone to them!

I won’t bore you with some long dramatic story but I will stay STAY AWAY. Save your money for someone who actually cares and doesn’t treat their customers like they mean nothing. ALSO not a that it’s a deal breaker but yeah they don’t wear masks.< /review>

I’m not one to complain but wow. I went with my daughter in law today and we were fumbling around looking for her mask and she yelled to me I can’t find it and one of the employees yelled u don’t have to wear one. Shocked we still went in and not one person had a mask on not to mention no protective shield by the register nothing. I won’t be returning</Review>

I have been shopping at Clifton&Warren for many years....
When I walked in to buy cat food the other day, I was shocked to see that 5 employees and the owner, were not wearing  masks!
When I, wearing a mask, asked why not,
the (28 yr old?) male employee leaned over the open air counter into my face and shouted: “I’m not sick!!!”
I responded that I would take my business elsewhere!
I was grateful that I was wearing a mask
when he sprayed his angry response, ...tho I now feel the need to get tested!

It’s not Politics...it’s Science!< /Text>

Owner was rude and snotty towards me. Only reason I continue to go there each month is because I'm on the buyer program for the cat food I get. Buy 10 bags get 1 free. They didn't add a few of the bags I purchased and when I asked about it they put me down for one even tho it should've been 3. I'm on bag 7 as of today. 3 more months then I'll start giving my business to some place else.... Tired of this B.S. should learn to treat your customers better. Without us they wouldn't even exist</text>

Phone manners are deploreable..called to ask if they accept Heap vouchers for wood stove pellets wanted to ask types of pellets availble and cost per bag. Heather was rude from the start..lectured me on how i dont need now and why Heap should be taking care of it instead of myself. As if i was an unwanted customer and being a Heap recipient makes me nasty in some way.will NEVER send business to this place EVER to even people with money.<//text>

Often when you are looking for practical solutions, no matter how much you roam up and down the isles of home depot it wont replace the value of exspierienced know how. And if your problem is at all animal or fence related you can likely find that know how here. They are not afraid to send you next door if what your project needs is a few nuts and bolts either!</text>

Just got home from store and discovered the antibiotic I just purchased had expired 7 months ago.  I called and was informed by their knowledgeable staff that it was OK.  I told them that it was not OK with me.  They said they could not help me unless I drove the 25 minutes back to the store to return it.   I said at least remove all the expired drugs so someone else doesn't get stuck like me.  Buyer beware.< /Text>

Good place to buy ranch and livestock feed and supplies. Staff is friendly, prices are standard compared to other feed stores in the area, parking and driving in and out is super easy which is a plus when you are buying lots of feed or hay.< /Text>

They promised May 3rd., 8am-4pm window.  No-show, and no communication.....I called them......the process repeated., and repeated, and repeated.....they finally showed up on install date 6.  Yep, there were no-shows 5 times.  Jasmine, installation coordinator, lied to me multiple times.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Worst experience of my life. It took multiple crews multiple days to do our home and they damaged so much stuff that we had to be reimbursed from empire by getting 3 quotes from contractors and then getting our reimbursement back from empire took forever for damage they caused.
This company is extremely unorganized no one knew what was going on. Their model is  quantity over quality. Get the guys in and out as fast as they can and on to the next job. They only pay their guys by the job, so in a house that’s going to require more time and skill it won’t happen since the workers need to be in and out.
Also they couldn’t even lay carpet correctly in our box shaped bedrooms there was a huge seem running right down the middle I noticed right away. Then in our closet where I guess they think you won’t go, exposed tax strips.
1st crew couldn’t finish our job since showing up at 4pm but they were kind enough to pull all the carpet off the stairs and lay down tax strips and say ok we have to go now and we are not sure we will be back. So we had them cover the exposed tax strips with cut off carpet as we also have pets and they won’t know to avoid those and good thing because it was a few days till another crew came back. That crew 2nd crew spent all day trying to wrap our stairs and got one done that was done poorly. They kept telling me there was no way anyone else in our 62 unit complex had these stairs. Nope they all do it’s how they were built. 2nd crew left still we had exposed tax strips on our stairs that we are using scrap pieces to cover. Finally the third guy Caesar only guy who knows what he is doing was able to wrap the stairs and oh said he had done another unit just like ours in our complex. He also had to fix our other normal set of stairs as those were not done correctly by 2nd crew. On one bottom piece they  literally just stuck the carpet piece up to it so it was free floating. Then the rest needed to be done as it was frayed looking they couldn’t get the bull nose of the stair correct. So finally no more exposed tax strips but to bad one cat stepped on one, thankfully not bad.
Then finally the 4th guy to fix the closets and cover the tax strips.
2nd crew removed our stair handrail and put gashes in our drywall that had to be re-mudded and painted. They also broke of piece of wood from the handrail and then didn’t put it back on. 3rd guy put it back on cause he said you can’t wrap the stairs with it off and was baffled by why the other guys took it off. Our bedroom door was broken at the bottom and we had so many scratches everywhere from everything needing to be redone multiple times.
I will never use empire again even though their sales team has called me twice and I keep telling them to remove me from their call list I will never buy anything from you again.<//Review>< date>

Don our sales advisor showed up exactly on time and gave us an education on the types of laminate floorings.  We had been shopping at the big box home improvement stores, and they offered no suggestions or advice and seemed like they just hoped we would leave them alone, Don presented our best options within our budget and we signed the contract with confidence we were getting the best product at an awesome price.
From the minute I met the installation team of  Josh and Jota, I felt honesty, superior knowledge, and confidence they would do an excellent job. They arrived both days precisely on time, explained what they would be doing, and worked quickly and professionally. They had great attitudes and were friendly and considerate. The installation was perfect, completed on time and not a trace of debris or waste was left behind.  Working in real estate I will be recommending  Empire to my clients and office.

<time>1567700635824</time><review>We are so disappointed. I've called customer service several times without a return call. We paid a lot of money for these floors and its just cheap work that was half done. Gaps everywhere and glue sticking out from the thresholds. I wish we kept our original floors now. $22,000 for this work is unacceptable. Also didn't help that the person installing the floors rummaged thru my laundry room to use my broom on the dusty glued old flooring, while he replaced the broom with a cheaper one, it was unprofessional to use without asking. If you need new floors search around and find someone that can do a better quality job. DO NOT use Empire Flooring.<//review>< name>

Over priced, I would say borderline scam.
2000 sqft of laminate quoted at 21k. This is their half price sale??? Which means normal price is 42k. Seems very wrong! Sales person said good luck and would not discuss other pricing options.<//text>

<Text>Decent carpet for the price but read the fine print...

They will completely screw up your base trim and won't do anything about it.

What good is free installation if you have to hire a painter to come in after to repaint ALL your base trim?

Wish I had gone elsewhere for carpet and install.</Text></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Terrible first experience with Empire.
Scheduled a carpet install for Dec 29th, but days later I received an email stating it was for the 30th. I called and they said they made a mistake and would knock off $200 for the inconvenience. Great. I take the 30th off work to prep and be there for the installers and never received a call for a eta. I called them and they said I was scheduled for the 9th of Jan not the 30th, then all of a sudden it’s the 11th of Jan. Whaaaaaat!?!?! This was not the agreement and I may have missed out on Home Depot’s free installation offer because I decided to go with this incompetent business. Not good, Empire. Not good.</Review>< time>

I was linked with Empire Today through Home Advisor. I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because they were prompt about contacting me and scheding an appointment. It all went downhill from there. I clearly communicated what flooring I needed (tile brand, color and grout) as well as how I wanted it installed (herringbone) to  the person scheduling the appointment. However, the sales representative was completely unprepared. He did not know if you could even install herringbone and had to call someone. He hadn't even determined the tile/grout was available or the price of it. To top it off he left saying I would have a quote in 2-3 days. 4 days later someone else called me from  Empire asking if I received my quote. By this time the 3 other companies that I had engaged had already given their quotes. They all showed up to the project having done their homework and just needed to measure the scope of work for final bid. Empire's lack of professionalism and timeliness cost them the chance to complete for this project as well as my next 2 projects I have lined up.< /Text>

EMPIRE TODAY! LEAVES HANDICAPPED CUSTOMER TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR! Today, an Empire installer arrived at Andrew's Kent, WA home to install carpet. Andrew is severely handicapped, and his brother and financial custodian had arranged with the company to make phone payment with the installers while they were on site and working. The problem arose when the installers arrived early, demanding payment before they would begin work, and Andrew couldn't immediately contact his brother to confirm payment. Rather than recognize the unique situation, the installers would not lift a finger to begin work, but left Andrew sitting on the porch, while they left to other jobs. Andrew's brother then spent the rest of the day--on telephone hold--with Empire's impersonal and powerless call centers. Have you ever spent a day on maddening hold with customer service, only to realize that they are powerless to do anything on your behalf? They just give you continuous cliches about how sorry they are for your inconvenience? That was our day with Empire. It was clear throughout the day that Empire's business model is not one tailored to customer service. The lesson for consumers is simple. First, no credible carpet company would demand payment in advance, before inspection of work is completed. Second, no reputable carpet company would employ installers that cannot recognize a unique situation and work within that situation in the customers' interest. Finally, Empire is a company that employs an impersonal call center "barrier," with telephone agents that are powerless to take action and are disconnected with other company departments. When you pay one department by phone, you can be sure that your payment will take hours, or days, to be communicated to other departments. All these are valuable lessons to be learned about Empire. But the most important is that EMPIRE TODAY! LEAVES HANDICAPPED CUSTOMER TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR!< /text>

Everybody I dealt with at Empire Today, from my initial call, sales representative, installer, billing, and customer service office have been professional, efficient, and courteous.  The next time I need carpet work done, I will call them.  I highly recommend Empire Today.</review>

The final product was outstanding quality, both porcelain tile that looks like hardwood and plush carpet that both turned out fantastic!  There were a couple of small communication bumps initially with scheduling delayed by a day, but the people were always very nice. The tile installers, especially Manny, were particularly kind and did an outstanding job. Our sales rep Lynda was very knowledgeable and patient with our questions, and Bret in local customer service was very professional.</text>

The experience couldn't have been much worse if they had tried and we cancelled the rest of the order.  BEWARE of Empire.  We had laminate installed in the family room, kitchen and laundry room thinking we were getting water proof flooring.  The installers told us it was only water repellent meaning any spills had to be removed within an hour.  Who would want that in a kitchen or laundry room?!  Then the installers told us we needed a moisture sealant on the foundation at the cost of an additional $700.  Nice surprise!  We live in Escondido and only had 3" of rain the last year.  It seems to me ethics are lacking at this company.  We decided we were done with Empire and cancelled the order.  Then they offered to reduce the price of the carpet for the rest of the house by $1200.  We told them we don't do business with this type of company.  WATCH OUT FOR EMPIRE.  The salesman (Sam) will tell you anything to get you to sign a contract.<//review>

I had one of the easiest requests possible. A small room needing carpet. The installers did not remove the previous flooring as the sales person stated they would. Once they got my money there was no return calls from the sales person and customer service was terrible this is my 7th call to get this resolved and still no return call. I had 3 other rooms to do but I’m not going through this again.</review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! The sales guy we had was completely HORRIBLE! Very cringy. He didn't bring us but only three samples of carpet AND laminate. Was very rude and pushy. He asked way too many personal questions, such as asking us how much our car was, how much we put down as a down payment, how much our house was, etc. way too personal. He made inappropriate jokes. He was all around horrible. He promised us we would get carpet two days later considering they were all booked up. That was a problem because we had paid movers to come the day he wanted to install, so we had to cancel movers and reschedule and pay a couple hundred for that. We were PROMISED installation on Thursday. Well guess what, Thursday morning comes and I get an email saying carpet is not going to be installed. Customer service is a joke. No help. Management didn't want to do anything. Now I have to pay the movers a SECOND TIME TO RESCHEDULE because they don't have enough materials. Horrible service all around. Only settled for this company because we needed fast installation. So much for next day!! Even second day. Don't use.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

we bought flooring from Empire. Carpet for the bedrooms and hardwood for the rest of our house. they sent in their contractors and they did the hardwood floors first with new baseboards, we moved all the bedroom furniture into our living area and they sent in separate contractors to do the carpets in bedroom, they didnt want to replace the rusty nailed tackboards, and after a week of fighting with them they came back and put the new tackboards and carpets in, but now they are hold us hostage over baseboards<//review>

This company sells a low quality, low durability carpet at a premium price. We purchased our carpet less then a year and a half ago and it already looks worse then the 5 year old carpet that we replaced. Please do not be lured in by their good salesmen with offers to finance, your carpet will need replacement before you can pay it off! If you have to finance go to Home Depot or Lowe’s.<//Text>

<Review>Oh, My! Run don't walk from this company! I don't get it, they spend a fortune advertising to us on T.V. Then when they come out, you basically find out you have wasted your time. I am on hold with them right now as I write this. We called, we set an appointment, a lady came out and promised us everything we asked for. She did not have enough time to finish our quote. She promised she would email it that evening. The email did not come in the evening nor the morning. I called Empire the next morning and asked what's up? They called the sales lady and said I would be getting a call. That call never came!! So I'm on hold with them right now to see where the quote is.

There are so many carpet places, I would not even call these guys all they do is suck your time.</Review>< Rate>

Very satisfied with my experience from Empire. From the sale to completion everything went smoothly. The installers were 3 men and they had my bedroom, bathroom and closet finished in 3.5 hours. The men cleaned as they went, and although it was a rainy day, clean up went easily. This was my second experience with Empire and could not be happier.</Review>

Empire flooring installed flooring on my staircase, however a error was detected, I notified the Co. they immediately sent someone out to view it. In a very short time the staircase was completely corrected together with a couple of other errors and thanks to Andy everything was done to perfection.  I would highly recommend Empire and especially Andy. I am very pleased with the end result.<//Text>

< Review>
Stay away from this company! Far away!
I had purchase flooring from them in January of 2019. I had a horrible interaction with them that time and still another one with this time! The salesman skipped corners of the appraisal so when the workers came to the job they were unprepared and did not have the right tools and pieces to install my floor (because there was a step in my house that had not been placed on the appraisal so they did not have the step stair-nose). Needless to say the install started taking place and and what was supposed to take 2 days took 5 days. I called to complain because I had lost a significant amount of money from my job being gone an unexpected 5 days instead of 2 (I was on the phone with customer service several times throughout this job and no one could ever seem to help me). I was hung up on by one teller because I told her I would wait on hold for the manager to get on the phone and she said she needed her line freed up to take other calls. Finally the manager called me back and did nothing for me. I emailed a very long message to their corporate office and they subsidized my cost of installation by $600 due to the money lost in my days of not working unexpectedly. Didn't account for the significant emotional stress I endured through this! However, why could no one at the managerial or general manager level help me at the SD location?? No idea!
Later, July of 2019 I had a house flood which led to some removal of my brand new flooring and needing to be replaced. I did not want to go through Empire, but was forced to because they would not sell me the floor out right and apparently monopolize the flooring industry to some degree, so only they sell the type of floor that they put in my home. I know this because my restoration company and homeowners insurance attempted to find it for me before I was forced to go through them again. So, an assessment had to be done through Empire which they charged me $170 for (but when you call to get a home estimate, it's free), but nonetheless I was at a loss because I had to go through them apparently. $170 later they said they could install for me the same floor because it was not old, and I got it done 9/18/2019. It looked the same one piece to another piece - and it was to some degree; however, when laid down and installed was noticeably different in sheen and texture/feel of it. I told their GM once again that it's not the same and they need to install the same flooring as they promised me. He argued it was the same. In fact, I spoke to him many times and the first reason for it not being the same was because of the chemicals I wipe my floors with. Water? Water can change texture to that degree? No. The boss installer revisited my house - funny, because the installer who came back out to look at it took pictures and took a slab from both old and new floor to show the significant difference because he stated it was significantly different. I told the GM (Jay Slate) I would pay for the job when it was done, as promised (but it was not done, it was not the same floor). I told the GM they needed to come back and install the same floor or I need to look into replacing my whole floor if this was not possible (which would mean another insurance claim). He said he was going to send my account to collections for the $775 I needed to pay them for the incorrect floor they installed. I have contacted the BBB.

I noticed on the other reviews that reach out to every reviewer on here to tell them to contact them to get a better solution. Empire.... your customer service representatives, management, and even GM is awful! There is nothing you can do to fix a scam company like yourself except start being honest and fair! When your GM is awful, you know your company is meant for scams!< /Review>

On Wednesday, the carpet showed up with a huge tear in the middle of it, so had to reschedule (after I already took a day off work).  Came three days later, on Saturday, they came back with the SAME roll with the tear in it! Unbelievable!! Said that they never had an extra roll to begin with.

My suggestion is go to Tri City Carpet. I went there at 10 am this morning, the same Saturday Empire came, and they are installing it now at 1:30 pm. Amazing customer service. And less expensive than Empire!

<review>The Luxury Vinyl Installers, Horrible! - The Carpet Guys, Excellent

This review was asked for by Empire via an email, months after this incident. I did not write this review until Empire asked me to via an email.

I contracted and paid for both carpeting and the Luxury Vinyl Tiles or Planking (LVT or LVP) in 2 bathrooms.

It all was supposed to be done in one day, carpeting and flooring. However when they came on the first trip, they did not have the flooring, just the carpeting. A second appointment was made for the flooring. (The bad part of this was we were having it all installed the day before out-of-town guests arrived to stay at our house.)

The two guys who came out the second time for the flooring, were idiots. Only one spoke very limited English, the other spoke no English. They wouldn't get out of the truck because I had dogs, a pug a Belgian and an old, old Boxer. They wanted the dogs in the house, but the issue is, guess what? The flooring is going to go in the house, not outside!

They wanted me to get rid of the dogs while they were here. What was I supposed to do? Board them? So the main guy, who spoke zero English, refused to do the job. The limited English speaking passenger finally got out of the van and showed the driver the dogs were fine. Nope, the driver wanted them gone from the property. Finally after about 20 minutes of this nonsense, I walked back inside and they sat in the driveway for about 30 minutes. When they went to leave, there was a huge transmission oil spot which I made them clean up, but it still left a mark.

You'd think Empire would be calling me right away. Nope, they didn't until about 3 weeks later. I had moved on by then.

Carpet guys were as nice as could be and did an excellent job.

Would be 5 stars for the carpet guys and just zero stars for the vinyl installers.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Go to home Depot save yourself a lot of time and frustration
Empire carpet is a  Complete  ripp off
Con job,  waste of time
go to home Depot there price is $5000 out the door
At empire carpet ,  $12,000 minus 50 percent off  $6000  total

If i can give a no star. I will.. Their customer service is very very poor.. The estimator will talk to you nice and will tell you to call anytime if you have a problem.. Tried to call them, left a message. Didn't call back. Ridiculous. The installer are so unprofessional. And was telling me they it is additional to put my bed back. Dude you took it off put it back in. Didn't left a receipt and left his drink on front my house. Like really? Not recommend! 👎👎< /review>

Definitely the worst!!
Company lacks any kind of customer service. After overcharging you and installation, you'll never reach them for any disagreement. Do not buy in this company, run away!!!< /Text>

After several unsuccessful visits to other tire shops and big brands I came to Smileys and was readily assisted. They supplied me with a set of good used tires which the other shops didn't have in their stock. They also mounted tires that I brought with me. The service was quick considering it's a tire shop which is always busy and the price was the beat part. Thanks for doing a great job. Highly reccomend.<//review>

<gmapID>0x80db7f09c7bebde9:0xf21cc6b203419f53<//gmapID><name>Chris Radcliffe</name><review>I needed four used tires for a project car. I had called other shops but went to Smiley's because of reviews. When I got there, I waited (a while as he dealt with customers who came in after me) for him to find four matching tires and told him mismatched brands were okay. I also brought cash, and asked for a lower price because they would be going on a project car so I didn't need super high quality.

Well, despite paying full price, I now have 4 different brands of tires, and three different sizes. I could've easily gotten four much better tires at other shops for the same price. For a discount, I might have been okay with what I got. But for what I paid, no thanks.<//review><resp>None< /resp>< Time>

Best tire shop in the IE hands down even better than some of the spots here in SD, he came in clutch for me and without a doubt could have closed shop and left me but he looked out for your boy and for that I will be forever thankful 🙏 I come from San Diego to get my tires from this shop that should tell you everything you need to know!< /Review>

< review>
The owner Smiley, was very very nice and extremely professional. I was in a situation with a rim leaking air. The owner offered to have the rim repaired and the air leak fixed. I expressed to the owner that I could get a better price in the city of San Bernardino. The owner offered to give me a loaner him so I can take my car to San Bernardino to have my room repaired for the better price. I was extremely appreciative for the offer because he did not have to do it. It’s simply told me that this business was not Price focused. It was focused on my experience and making sure that I got what I needed. I really appreciate and I highly recommend Smiley’s used tires.<//review>

Was referred here by my father in law and oh man am i thankful. The customer service here was amazing. Smiley was very clear and explained everything to me in detail. Brought my car in today to get brand new tires and was in and out in about an hour in a half. Got a great price and everything.  Will definitely be back and will definitely reffer this place to all my friends and family. Such a great vibe there, seeing how many people go to him was amazing to see. Shows alot about the business. Thank you smiley and staff for everything ❤</Text>

I Got two used tires for my sandrail today and they were way under $100.00. They have  85% tread left on them and look awesome! Thanks Empire Tire Shop!<//text>

No. I used this place for a temporary tire for a week. Came home  and saw a gash about 1.5in long. At first I didn't notice a thing until I got home where I now park with the mark on top. The damage can only be done from the tire hydraulic prong.

Pro: good price
Cons: inexperienced, hiding damage< /Review>

<review>I have been to Active gyms, and I would say this one is less than a regular Active gym.  Active gym would have a power rack and a squat rack.  This one only have the oldest power rack I have seen.  There's only one beach press.  A regular Active usually have multiple.  I would say this gym is half the size of a regular Active gym, and as such you should expect half the equipments available.  I suspect this is a Super Sport gym due to its location.  One thing I like about this gym is that it seems to be very quiet and peaceful.</review>< gmap_id>

<Text>The staff is friendly and it's relatively clean, especially compared to their other locations. The glaring negative here is how small this place is for a gym. There's plenty of treadmills, but the free weights and machines are pretty slim pickens. If you want a cheap gym that's close, then this place is fine. If not, then definitely look elsewhere.</Text>< rating>

So this is an active, this super sport member was a bit shocked when walking in to find out that this gym had no locker room, only restrooms and a separate gender neutral changing room... weird I know, but it's an active and you get what you pay for I guess. All in all the equipment was decent way better than what I see at most sport locations honestly, just a bit crammed in that's all</Review>

<Text>Not only is this already a much smaller gym than other 24hr locations, much of the equipment is often broken.  Literal weeks will go by and no effort is made to make repairs. Staff is inattentive at best and rude at worst.  Was briefly considering reinstating my membership after a hiatus because my friend still has a membership and I wanted to see if things had gotten better.  The manager would not even take a few seconds to speak to me to answer the questions I had.  Safe to stay I am not considering reinstating anymore and I will be taking my business elsewhere.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Look. The hours here suck and there are now showers or towels, but they also tell you that UP FRONT. All you people acting shocked, as if they didn’t tell you. Silly.

Equipment is fine and dandy, and staff are super friendly. Again, the hours suck but this gym has literally everything I need and nothing I don’t. Happy customer.< /Text>

The fact that this gym is in the heart of downtown Santa Monica is a depressing thought indeed. The machines are old and the facility is not clean (bathrooms). The trash cans were overflowing with paper towels, etc. The facility in general is in dire need of an overhaul as it feels tired inside.  If you think that your gym experience at this 24hr fitness location is going to be exemplary because it is located in a high-end tourist town such as Santa Monica than you are not going to be happy. Look elsewhere or take a run on the beach. Do not waste your time or money.<//review>< pictures>

I like the gym because it is always fun saying Hello to Rachel. She is wonderful. Valerie is there to help me how to workout and not feeling guilty for missing out Yoga. Mike is superb for keeping up the morale of the gym. If I want to be provoked, I take a look at the homeless and figure there are millions of reasons not to be provoked.</text>

I chose two stars rather than one because the gym is extant; if you're already a 24 member, having some gym space available here is better than having none. But on its own terms, this is the worst gym I've ever trained at. The free weight areas are tiny and poorly stocked, with a limited collection of weights, a single worryingly rickety power rack, a single bench, a characteristically worthless Smith machine, and no space to deadlift. The upstairs area has a collection of early-90s Nautilus machines (that, to the gym's credit, does at least include one cable tower, however janky and over-subscribed). There are no showers and extremely limited locker space. But the space is clean, and the staff seems nice, and again: it exists.<//Review>

No shower! Came here before work and was a terrible mistake. Could hardly workout. Could use any of the weights without being or having someone in the way. The gym wasn't even crowded. Definitely has to be the worst 24hr fitness gym</Review>

Please beware the unprofessional zumba instructor Lesley. She is super racist and lazy. She pushed one of her class member when she was teaching in the Hollywood club and asked class member to teach for her. That is why she get fired. She is liar and fake person. I would not recommend anyone take her classes. We are super happy with the new instructor in Hollywood club now.< /Text>

WARNING - You will ultimately regret being part of this gym. Their policies on cancellations are absolutely rediculous. A very clear deliberate grab for money they refused to refund my annual fee only a week after I had to cancel my membership because I was moving away. It's not so much about the money it's the fact that literally no one I spoke to was understanding enough to try and work something out. It makes no sense paying an annual fee for the upcoming year if I won't be using the gym during that period because my membership is cancelled. Extremely disappointed and I will make sure all my friends and family don't use a wellness brand that doesn't actually care about people. I've been a patron of this gym for years and this was the experience I got.<//Text>

I'm a street performer on the Santa Monica pier and on the Santa Monica 3rd Street Promenade.   I sing and dance  hiphop /rap, edm, rock, pop and latin.  This is a small active level 24 Hour Fitness. There are no showers. It's usually not too crowded except during morning and evening rush hours. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. There's just not too much to it. I feel that 24 Hour Fitness could have put a bigger and better Club in downtown Santa Monica. Yes I realize there is a bigger Club on Ocean View Blvd. but it would be great to have a full size Club in downtown Santa Monica where this one is..<//Review>

Every single 24 Hour Fitness that I have visited in LA has serious deficiencies.  Albeit small, this one is by far the most well-organized, clean, and "better-smelling."
The exposed brick-walls give it a clean, boutique feel.</review>

As 24 hour ftiness lites go, this one is probably one of the best. Don't expect a shower or free parking, but the rest is great with new equipment. They are not open 24 hours so check in advance.<//text>

Terrible. When I went to cancel my membership because I was moving, the guy at the desk said that I had to wait for the manager but had no idea when she would be back. When I asked for a number to call, he gave me the customer service line but I had to wait over half an hour of wait time before I got to speak to anyone. I had to give them one start out of five though, because I can't give a 0/5.</Review>

<review>Okay plz do not go this horrible fitness
I was exercising here  several months ago. when I made my membership, I explain I will move to San Francisco after several month. then they recommend some plans then I used one of that plan. when I leave Santamonica, I canceled my membership. Also, I checked it again to agent. then he said yes. Then, I went to Francisco. however, in February, I realized I have paid monstrously fee every month. I claimed them that I canceled it.  they said "there are no record about my cancel. So,  I need evidence." when they process cancel they sent email and give receipt. Oh I did not get that.  how I get that evidence ? if he did not complete my cancel of course I did not get receipt. Also, there is record I did not go there after september. then I talked long time with one of staff. and she said she will call back but I didn't get that. now I tried to call them but it doesn't work. by the way. oh even, staff lie to me she will call back, then she never :)<//review><GmapID>0x80c2a4d021367221:0xd086363df5a93ad6< /GmapID><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

I'm a member here and it's a little misleading calling it a supersport club because there is no pool or showers. I was told they had to classify the club this way because a major gym just opened on the same block. It has a very relaxed vibe. All the weights, machines and other equipment needed is here. Being classified a supersport club does give you acces to all the other supersport clubs that do have pools in the country. Entry is done through finger scanner and phone number. No cards to get in. The red brick walls feel right and comfortable for the gym. Staff is very friendly and helpful. You have the feeling that the staff knows you and it never feels crowded. It's a comfortable place to get a workout in before or after work. Very large parking garage right next door.</review>

My specific incident is listed below but overall this club is very poorly maintained, always dirty, lights are missing, walls are poorly patched, overall the worst gym ive ever been to. But its close to my home so I still go there 5 days a week but I was in the military and have a high tolerence. But for the average person, You will be extremely dissapointed.

I went in to your club on 10/30/10 at 11:26 on Saturday. Your employee Daniel Paico and Jennifer Kucek were working the front desk. I expressed my repeated concern about the drinking fountain that has not been functioning for over 3 months. I asked if they could check to see what type of membership my fiancee had so that we could go to the 24 fitness club a few miles away that had a working drinking fountain. Daniel walked over to his desk with my fiancee Jenny to check the membership type. Jennifer said "a working drinking fountain, we have a working drinking fountain" mind you I cannot express appropriately the condescending tone used but want you to know it was Very! innapropriate. She also said "yeah check, whatever makes you happy" while raising her fist in the air, "more power to you". Now let me say that I very disrepsected and I am demaning something done about your employee's complete lack of respect, tact, education, and overall decency as a human being. I honestly expected your employee to say, here is a pass for Jenny to go to the other club for another month until we get this problem fix, last thing I expected was to be insulted and belittled. Completely unacceptable! in a state with a 12.5% unemployement rate, Jennifer doesn't deserve to not be included in that number.< /text>

This is the best hole in the wall restaurant for teriyaki food in Glendale!!! Been coming here for roughly 15 years and will continue to go till their last day. I always get the shrimp chowmein but the chicken and beef is really good too! Their teriyaki sauce is home made and sooo good! What I like about this place is that food is made to order. It's not like Panda Express that sometimes has food sitting for a while. I mean it's not bad once in a blue moon but mitzees is way better especially on the rainy days lol. If your thinking about going but unsure, don't hesitate, pull the trigger. And when you go, make sure to leave a review. Allot of us now a days go by reviews.

When you go, make sure you ask questions just to be sure your not allergic to anything or whatever.

Small plate is $8 and change and large I think $10. Almost everyone, I get the $8 because it's good portions and pretty filling.

Also, it might not look like they have a bathroom but they do. It's all the way to the back and thru the door, you'll see it.

Stop by, you won't regret it, I promise!<//text>

The bulgogi was hot, tender and juicy. The accompanying noodles were firm and flavorful. They white rice was fluffy and not overcooked. Watch out for the spicy sauce!</Review><time>1546488280796<//time><rating>5<//rating>< Pictures>

<review>I ate there recently. I met friends there, as our usual dinner place was closed. I ordered the vegetable and noodles. The dish had three very tiny pieces of a broccoli floret. Not a whole floret, but pieces of it.

The egg rolls are just fried dough with  barely enough filling to justify being  called a roll.

Don't eat here!!! It's  a front for something else.

I don't know what the other reviewers had, but what I had was awful. I should have not eaten there, judging by the area where the food is cooked. Nasty! Then they have signs all around asking to be "Yelped!" Please.<//review>< GmapID>

Very nice and polite servers took great care of our large group. Due to COVID-19, we had to break up into three tables. Fortunately, they had three very close to each other, so we weren’t very far apart. It was lunch and I had the salmon Caesar salad. One of my favorites.</Review>

<rate>4<//rate><Text>Been coming for years, but never wrote a review. This place is great and definitely worth the wait when the line is almost out the door! I love that you get to see them making your order right in front of you while you are in line waiting to pay. They have a great selection of their homemade award winning salsas which is at a self serve bar. This is a self seated place which can get pretty packed. I love how diverse the crowd is especially at night, you see people who are all dressed up stopping in for their favorite bites to people who are coming in pajamas to bring their favorite bites home! They have a pretty big menu and we have not been disappointed not one time. My husband lives their shrimp cocktails and burritos, our daughter and I Love their nachos, tacos and quesadillas!<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Descent food if on a budget, and you get plenty of it. The service is good and the open kitchen shows their cleanliness. I always order the taco dinner for 11.50, and I can never finish it because it's so much. I recommend this to all my backpacking friends/tourist who are in need of a lot of food for a low price.<//Text>

This is a very good place to eat. Everything is excellent and top notch except for the kind of meat they use for their Carne Asada plate. I looks like the cheapest cut of meat. Even Chuck beef (Diezmillo) would be way better and juicier. RibEye would be ideal but it's probably too expensive. But please don't use the horrible meat that your using now. It's dry tough and flavorless.<//text>

Came here for the last night of Oakland Restaurant Week with some friends. Looking for something special. One issue that arose quickly was the "dinner price" listed on the Open Table website and the price on the menu, online being $20. and the menu $30. Our waiter said the online price was for lunch, although it CLEARLY said DINNER. This is not the first bait and switch encountered using Open Table.< /text>

I was visiting East Bay and wanted to organize a dinner for friends who live in the area. I love Mexican, so I was hoping to find a Mexican restaurant. One came highly recommended but had a high minimum for groups of 10+ and I didn't want to be on the hook in case folks needed to cancel last minute.<//review>

When it comes to Mexican food, usually it's pretty much the same story everywhere you go.  But this particular restaurant just... Did it better than the rest.  Smothered tortilla chips, orange slice water for starters, and then a breakfast chorizo burrito.  I can't remember the last time I ate every last scrap.  10/10 for food taste and quality</text>

My friend ordered a red wine, ceviche, Chile relleno, and churros. We got chips and guacamole for a starter. We both loved our drinks, the chips and guacamole, and the ceviche. They were really tasty. The Chile relleno was too small for a main course, and the flautas were a bit bland, but overall tasted good.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Pretty amazing Mexican food and it tasted so clean. Beverage options and Mexican coffee just hit the spot. Only waited about 20 minutes on a Saturday. This will be a go to spot every time I come into town. Beans, salsa, cheese, and onions everything was a perfect blend of the right amount. I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for this spot. Highly recommend! Service was great and staff was all friendly and nice! You order and pay first inside then they bring your food to the table. Perfect weekend brunch!</Review>

<Review>Great family-owned laid back Mexican restaurant. Food is made from scratch using quality ingredients, and you can taste it. Nice ambiance thanks to the super high ceiling and old skylight. Complimentary chips and salsa with a nice mole sauce. I love this place, but I wish they opened earlier and closed later so I could get dinner here!</Review>< Pics>

While there's many burrito places around, I tend to favor this place. There's virtually no place these days where you can get two meals for around 7 bucks.I mean coffee and toast can be that much sometimes.   But if you go at the wrong time, the lines can be long.The food is always good here and freshly made.The super burrito is my favorite. Although I usually eat it as two meals.Because each half is akin to you have a food baby.You know what I am talking about.Overall this place has it all, value, tasty food, and great take away option.Oh don't forget to get some grilled tortilla chips and salsa.< /Review>

This is a fantastic place but it really feels like their hours are random.  This prevents me from eating there.  I've walked by 5 or so times during normal business hours and they were open once.

I would love to eat here more but the weird hours keep me from doing so<//text>

Potential! This is a locals restaurant that could easily blossom into a into one of my go-to's for a great meal with friends and family.  Like most mom & pops, all it needs is a little love and the time needed to grow into its space. The food, while a little expensive, is still reasonable to the portions and the flavors seal the deal for a dollar well spent.

The space itself is large and feels a bit cavernous.  It needs a redesign, but they as a business have done fine job with what they have.  The staff were friendly and I felt welcomed from the moment I set foot inside.  Which for me, sets the tone for the entire meal and will keep me coming back for more.</text>

Really nice, fresh plates of food and handmade tortillas. Homemade everything and the best complementary chips and salsa I've ever had (sprinkled with a little bit of beans and cheese). Most of their business is takeout/catering so you can always find a seat. Always a LatAm futbol game on the TV. Authentic, friendly, and clean.<//review>

I've never tried the signature chilequiles, but I do frequently get the special salad with carnitas. It's fresh and tasty lunch. They also do delivery on Postmates so sometimes I order it to be delivered when there isn't enough time to go out (the parking isn't fantastic there unfortunately). I keep this in my regular lineup when I need a tasty lunch out!<//Text>

Terrible service. Made an order through their online service and on this particular day they were closing outside of their regular business hours due to a catering event. Rather than calling me and letting me know the order had been cancelled, they waited until I showed up to the cook cleaning the stoves as they apparently had closed very recently(probably after my order had come in). He proceeds to tell me he got no order and I showed him the receipts of my charges for the order and the pick up time I was sent.

Finally he call his sister? Cousin? Supervisor? (No idea I was just handed the phone) Who tells me the order has been cancelled but they don't handle the payments so I will be refunded in 3-5 days....

HTF as a business do you

A) take orders when you are not open during normal business hours.

B) after receiving an order you do not plan to fill, not notify the customer of the fact that you are cancelling their order.

Food is mediocre anyway, there is way better Mexican food in the area that will get your order right in the same price range.

Will not be ordering from here again.< /Text>

<Time>1452992234165< /Time><Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Ordered a veggie burrito subbed peppers with spinach & potato but they forgot the most important ingredient which is the beans!! The burrito is still good but the beans are my source of protein and my favorite part! I would rather have more beans and no rice. They are close to my apartment so I'll try them again and update my review...< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>After Café May on Spring Street closed I was looking for a new Mexican place for breakfast. I've been meaning to try out Guero for a while now and finally got there. Another great new little place in downtown that will definitely be on my go-to list from now on.

You can get (almost) all the breakfast things as plates, burritos or torta sandwiches. We had the Huevos con Machaca as a burrito and huevos con chile verde as a plate. we got some free chips as a starter with two different kinds of salsa on them and refried beans. DELICIOUS!! You can always tell if it's a good place if the salsa is good and it was. Our main breakfast dishes were extremely good, great quality, and you can get more salsa if you want.

They have a big variety of dishes and three changing daily ones which looked amazing. The staff is super friendly too!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) I really liked this place.
But the quality of their food has dropped a lot. Today I bought a burrito and this was covered in fat and the chicken is already burned and the chips are horrible. Hopefully and be more careful when preparing it.

First time we could eat indoors in a year. Four of us wonderfully welcomed by Carlos, Fabio and the rest of a terrific staff.  The plates were delicious. We did a lot of splitting and sharing. The wine chosen by Fabio was perfect. I am so glad they survived. Service, food and wines were each special and five star.<//text>

Just got featured on a hivemind website called reddit for not enforcing mask mandates, expect floods of 1 star reviews. If you are a native to the area, this is the place to be. Great food, great people, very respectful staff and owner. Would recommend for families and small dates< /text>

<date>1580839154935</date><text>Though there are more than one Pane e Vino restaurantts, this one stands out for its authenticity. Our favorite waiter has worked here for over 20 years, and his accent is still influenced by his native Italian roots. The food is equally authentic, and the menu is quizzically long and diverse - a benefit abandoned long ago by most restaurants driven by a profit requirement.  The wine list features enough domestic wines to satisfy those whose palates are attuned to tthe California style, but the list is still dominated by Italian wines of good quality. If Italian wines are a mystery to you (you're not alone!!) just ask your server for a recommendation once you've made your dining decisions, and he/she will recommend a match made in heaven.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We really enjoy Pane e Vino.  The food is always fantastic.  Great family atmosphere and polite table service.  The catch, of course, is get a reservation.  They are generally packed, so a reservation is the only guarantee for a table.  If you don't have a reservation, go earlier rather than later in the evening.  Their pasta is delicious.  Order a glass of wine and enjoy a relaxing, and tasty, evening.</Review>< UserId.>

Great, original Italian place. The owner and the waiters speak Italian, which is a good sign of originality. The food is great, simple, fresh, delicious. Try the Tagliatelle con Funghi.
Nice, cozy ambience. Walkable neighborhood.<//text>

This restaurant obviously panders to a certain crowd. A crowd that looking around is probably retired or close to.
The service was slow but friendly. The bus boys were quick to clear plates but never refilled water.
I had a glass of Prosecco, and would have liked a second one with my main course but was never attended to by the water or service staff.
My friend had the Scallops as an entree they were fragrant in all the wrong ways but apparently palatable to him.
My entree was the Risotto with Seafood and it was bland/plain (probably to cater to older palates) the shrimp was hard and had more bite then most of the clientele and I could not eat much more as it was simply unappetizing. An Entree for 25 dollars and I will probably hunt down a slice of pizza else where on my way home.
This was a major disappointment on all levels.</Text>

Solid Italian food. I'm vegetarian and there's only one vegan option dish on the menu, so not gonna be my go to place. Good service. Went there on a date and it was too loud for us to talk. Expensive.</Text>

I get the Capellini Al Pomodoro Fresco, it's an angel hair with super fresh tomatoes garlic and basil. (Less of a creamy marinara sauce, more of a fresh-chopped tomato style sauce.) Delicious and A+!< /review><rate>5</rate><Pics>None< /Pics><Name>Jeff Bargmann</Name></record></dataset><record>

I moved back to SF a few months ago after a 30 year absence, and am finding new favorite restaurants. We were looking for a nice meal after work and decided to drive up Union street and see what we could find. We passed Pane e Vino, and there was a good crowd for a weeknight, so we decided to take chance. We are so happy we did. We have been there three times now, and everything we have ordered was perfect. The service is always friendly and accommodating. The dining room is a bit crowded, but full of life. On our last visit, we found there is a patio out back that is more to our liking. It feels like Italy, it tastes like Italy - dolce far niente!<//text>

Great neighborhood place. Standard Italian fare on the standard menu, but I suggest to order from the daily specials menu - it features great seasonal ingredients and exciting dishes.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Among the pizzas, pro somehow cotto e funghi is delicious. Sicilian or the pizza is a little salty. The staff were so friendly and ate. Takeout is also available. That's at least $ 3 more than Google's photo price.

(Original)
피자 중에선 pro어쩌고 cotto e funghi가 맛있습니다. 시칠리아인가 그 피자는 좀 짜요. 직원 분들이 정말 친절하셔서 맛있고 편하게 먹었습니다. 테이크 아웃도 가능합니다. 구글에 사진찍힌 가격보다 최소 3달러는 올랐습니다.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) Small Italian restaurant off the beaten path. Small menu with appetizers, pizza, pasta, fish and meat dishes. The day pass we liked the most. The wines are quite expensive. Beer and soft drinks are normal in the price. Unfortunately no Refill. Who in the area is should go

It came here because of the very very high rating. Quality of breakfast item is more like a 4.2. Ambiance is a 4.0 but the customer service is where they shine at a five-star attentiveness. I'm guessing their lunch items is where they get their best marks<//Review>

<Text>The food is decent, we visited our first time today which is a Holiday so I'm not sure if that affected the wait time. (About an hour) They were very busy . If there's a wait when you visit be prepared to wait outside. Parking is tough as the lot is small. However, Coffee and service were both very awesome!</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUUQ_f8RUSp6zAJCZYsa4iHSj0GdXDqpqYIUUV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5qXd9mc5rCZEj_ZdmwlXIAFd1hrt0VtzMC2qx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. Wait was not long, all of the staff were friendly and the food was delicious! We are definitely adding this to our weekend breakfast rotation! My husband liked it so much, he bought a shirt!< /Review>

<text>The food was not very good. Corned beef hash had just a little shreds of corn beef. Food was not hot. Scrambled eggs overcooked possibly made ahead of time. Was disappointed. Did not even take the leftovers. Not coming back.

This place is awesome!! The wait staff is on point and took great care of us! We had the chicken fried steak and eggs. The portion was more than generous for the price. Our waiter recommended we try their housemade habanero hot sauce it was the BOMB!! They had a nice little tent out front for seating. Everything was super clean. We encountered many staff members and they were all very attentive and friendly!! This place is a MUST try!!<//text>

<review>I love this place so much! I especially love their biscuits and gravy and chicken fried steak with gravy. I wish y'all delivered to Rancho Cucamonga where I live but it's totally worth the drive. Nowadays it's hard to find a restaurant that I trust; that is truly clean, provides good food and freshly made dishes. The service is excellent ! Thank yall sooo much! Keep rockin<//review>< Pictures>

My second time here and everything I have ordered has been fresh, great tasting and came with great service. They are open for breakfast and lunch only, and they get busy, but well worth the 10-20 minutes wait .< /review>

<text>This place is a hidden gem, I was looking for a good place for breakfast and stumbled on this, had good reviews so said what the heck. We got seated right away, I already knew what I wanted since the menu was online and the raves about it were awesome. The wait staff were all very nice, they came by a lot to check in and see if you would like a refill. The tipping is they have flavor creamer French Vanilla no other and the coffee it good. Will definitely be back. Prices are reasonable as well.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqFB7nLyyQ8kkJSZAB2JHBsMMa66s3nVIM-h0A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQsVeXTn3TZGMLQyS4r0baqvNGKqM3q2uG5ZiM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< time>

Great food, large portions, friendly staff.  Have never been disappointed coming here.  If you get a breakfast burrito try it with gravy or homemade salsa.< /text>

Hands down best restaurant I've been to for breakfast. From the warm, friendly service, to the super delicious food and coffee. Stop by if you're in the area! Or even if you're quite a ways out! You won't regret it!😊< /Review>

Excellent kind, friendly, clean and comforting service. Especially considering how they are forced to comply with County and Covid mandates. Our burgers and friends were so delicious, mouth watering and perfect portion. Definitely coming back<//review>

< Review>
5 STARS OK,5.

I TRULY CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS PLACE, I HAVE DRIVEN BY SOOOOOO MANY TIMES SAYING

"IM GOING IN ONE DAY."

OK I WASTED A LOT OF TIME NOT DOING SO AND MISSING A DARN GOOD MEAL, good atmosphere, Hometown feel, ( which I miss from my part of Texas,") exceptional service, not good,  EXCEPTIONAL!!!!
The service was so exceptional I honestly cannot tell you who my server was but in the end Mesa (My OPOLIGIES if spelled incorrectly)  is the individual server that picked up my check HOWEVER  one person greeted me at the door, another met me at my table and ask ABOUT drinks, another brought the food to the table, and upon my eating it was almost celebrity Service.

As there was constant attention of do you you need this, do you need that etc..
This day I was multitasking and I was on the phone (witch I hate to do especially while eating) my counterpart could  hear the service  and asked if I was in uniform.  (I was not)  it was just exceptional service The meal was exquisite. The service phenomenal.

Had to wait a bit, but I CLEARLY understand why.
I will start being my team, and club members to this location.

Again MESA I advised you I would add your name to my Review & and done so, You ALL were GREAT...
See you soon.< /Review>

I am so glad that I went. Although the parking is extremely limited, parking is available along the roadside. When I saw the clientele, I knew it would be good. These were locals who live and work in the area (who could easily drive a few blocks north or south for other food), so I expected it must be good. It is decorated nicely in a fresh and comfy way. This restaurant is clean! I was very impressed with how much attention is paid to it by the owners. The food is plentiful and yummy. They had a menu with a variety of breakfast and lunch items. The service was quick and super friendly. All of our food was cooked perfectly. My mom said their coffee was delicious. I loved their homemade salsa/ sauce.</text>

<text>Long wait once we were finally called we noticed several empty tables. We ordered coffee we had to ask for refills several times because no one was coming around with coffee plus we were missing the flavored creamer that every table had but ours.

<text>On a business trip decided to give this place a try due to other reviews. I was not misled. This is a small place, if your heading north on Vineyard and catch the light to tunn on 8th you'll like drive right past. It's right at the corner, don't miss it. inside is nice and friendly and the staff is helpful and attentive. I was recommended the chicken fried steak for breakfast and wanting the best of both worlds I did the diced chicken fried steak omelet. I saved on lunch because I was still stuffed when lunch time rolled around. Everything was well prepared and not over cooked. I will say take it a little easier on the gravy over the biscuits, your biscuits are excellent and they just need about 1/2 that gravy to top them off. Also for all you business travelers they do not take Amex, yes we've all had that happen before, but I will say Johnny's was worth spending my personal money on, plus all that food is ridiculously low priced and if corporate thinks all California food is this cheap they'll try to reduce the per deim cost :-) . I'll be back....</text>< user_name>

The breakfast at Johnny O's is terrific, American style fare.  Their scrambled eggs are the lightest and fluffiest I've ever had.  You'll swear they're whipped with club soda, or maybe helium. 😁 Service is prompt and very friendly.  If I didn't live so far away I'd be there every other weekend.< /text>

Pleasantly surprised! We had been to this site previously under prior ownership  ... it had been a typical 'greasy spoon.' Things have been elevated! Still a bucket load of comfort food on the menu but it's minus the 'greasy' part! We were here at Breakfast time while having our car serviced up the street (at The Auto Shop, a honest-to-goodness HONEST mechanic,  Al Davis). Greeting was very friendly.  Server Brian proved to be a pleasure. We decided to split the Chicken Fried Steak & eggs plate as we had heard that the portion sizes here were quite generous. As our meal arrived, it had already been split in the Kitchen onto two plates and both were visually appealing. The food was fresh and tasty. Even though Brian brought us steak knives, they weren't necessary as we could cut through they protein with our forks. The biscuits & gravy were spot on and the home fries are a winner. Can't wait to try other menu items! We'll surely schedule our next car service accordingly!< /review>

This place is okay, super busy so you get slow service and kinda cramped. Potatoes were so cooked they were charred on the bottom and they don't have sour cream. Scramble was the best part of eating here. Suggest going to Zekes eatin place a mile or two down the road instead.< /review>

<text>The hamburger steak was fantastic for brunch. On a bed of homefries with 2 eggs and a side of biscuits and gravy the combo worked wonders. The house hot sauce that came upon request was also miles better than I thought it would be. Overall I was really surprised by the quality of this place and will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

<Review>Man so these guys know how to make a steak sandwich. I will be back for another pretty soon. My wife loved her pancakes but I can't talk about that steak sandwich enough. The bread was crispy, the meat was perfectly med rare and the fries were fried perfectly. Now I see what all the commotion is about with this place.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Nothing wrong with small town feel, I say, where the people are friendly and you're valued when you walk through the door. This was exactly my experience this past Saturday morning. Our waiter was outstandingly friendly and attentive to details. We took his advice on the house favorites and were not disappointed: Chicken Fried Steak and Meat Lover's Breakfast Burrito with chorizo added. Give this small place a try.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>A step back in time.... just like the diners i ate in when i was young.  The moment i walked in the smell of the much used griddle filled the place...it smelled so good.  The burgers were the best I've had in years.  Quality meat,  fresh buns and ingredients and cooked perfectly!  Open for breakfast and lunch.... they also have taco Tuesdays.... they looked delicious.... Will have to try them soon.< /Review><Time>1541994030098</Time>< rate>

Awesome place for a typical brunch. It's a quaint place and standalone for a typical American food. The chicken steak omelette and the classic breakfast are those that we ordered and it was top of the world. Don't miss it.</Text>

Good customer service, very friendly but there seem to be two to cover the place so service might get stretched thin during peak times. Burgers were great! I've tried the Cali and the Western and the meat was seasoned just right for my taste. I've tried two sandwiches and they would be what you'd expect from your above average diner. Burger/sandwich plates are around $11. Breakfast seems to be popular, most patrons had that while I was there eating lunch.<//Review>

Oh my! The best bisquits, I haven't been disappointed yet. I haven't had everything on the menu  but everything I have had has been very good. The wait staff is fast and friendly.
I'm here way to often, don't want to burn out.<//Text>

The staff were friendly, accommodating, and I never had to even think about asking for a coffee top up; the coffee flowed in abundance. The home fries were perfectly spiced and if you like to decorate your food and palate, the options do not disappoint from the house made hot sauce to fresh pico de gallo. Omelettes were tasty, too!</Text>< Rating>

Okay place to eat, food and prices are decent however cleaning is very important in a restaurant and this one in particular needs lots of bid! When I set down in the chair the floor was so greasy that I can't keep my chair from sliding<//Review>

Great Food and Spectacular Service.
I usually come for breakfast when I visit from AZ. Today I came for lunch and was not disappointed.  I had the Pastrami and Swiss burger. Hands down an amazing burger. Brian and Anthony are great staff. Always taking great care of the customers.< /review>

Hella good burger joint, but they sometimes make you work for it with unreliable hours(closed certain days), but sooo worth it. Call ahead to make sure they're open so you don't get disappointed after driving over there. I think it's kinda part of their charm. I haven't personally eaten breakfast here, but I've heard raving reviews and it looks amazing when I see it coming out for other tables. Huge portions and really great tasty burgers and onion rings.< /review>

<Text>Went here for a New Year's Eve morning brunch. It's a small spot and they were swamped by the holiday crowd, but the wait staff was busting hump. Kitchen wasn't fast but it was good considering the crowd and the servers did their best to care of us while we waited. The food is classic American comfort stuff and the servings huge. The price is great. Definitely wanna go here again when they aren't getting their butts kicked but a holiday rush. Great place to go if you wanna eat alot of food for not so much money and appreciate a hard working staff. Great place.</Text>< Time>

Awesome! Huge portions! Quick friendly service, very attentive. Came here with a bunch of 16 year old boys and we were surprised at the portion size, even more than they could handle. All the food was fanstatic.</review>

<rating>4</rating><Text>The outside could use an upgrade but it's not too much of a problem. The inside dining area is about the size of a living room but has a lot of character.  The servers were really friendly in a way that seemed genuine. As in they were happy to be polite rather than only doing it otherwise they might get fired or something. It took a while to get my order but it was worth it and I doubt the place is ever empty. It's a bit far from where I live but if I'm in town with friends id be more than willing to bring them too.
Just keep in mind that they may not take American Express cards. Idk why but that wasn't a problem for me.

Tldr;
Pros:
- Great food
- Great prices
- Great Service

Cons:
- A bit odd looking on the outside and could probably use some form of shading for those that have to wait
- if they raise enough space maybe they can expand the building a bit to seat more people<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

JOHNNY O's is the BEST 1960s Diner my family and I have ever eaten at.  The Burger's are Humongous .. Delicious .. the Fries .. Tacos , Omelettes .. Melts .. Steaks ; ALL mouth watering .  Very Affordable for the portions you receive. We've been customers since day one .. BUT most importantly it's the Staff .. JOHNNY , Brian , Veronica , Randy , Jenn .. that add the icing to a restaurant you will return to over and over .. year after year</Text>

This space was the perfect greasy spoon to visit on our trip to San Bernardino/Ontario, CA. The staff were friendly, accommodating, and I never had to even think about asking for a coffee top up; the coffee flowed in abundance. The home fries were perfectly spiced and if you like to decorate your food and palate, the options do not disappoint from the house made hot sauce to fresh pico de gallo. Omelettes were tasty, too!<//review>

I was especially happy with the French toast which wasn't soggy in middle like many places. They were thick and oh so good. Pricing was very appropriate too. Only $26 for all 4 of us. Definitely recommended.</review>< Pics>

This little breakfast joint does it right. The food is juat amazing and just as amazing is the customer service. The whole crew is on it. If you like spicy try their habanero salsa. Also their lunch is prettt good with juicy burgers and great chilli. One of my all time favorites.</text>

This place is the best! Just get there early because they get really busy and they're a small place! If u have to wait, don't fret, it's worth it! .....and the price is right! Great deal!< /Review>

My phone order placement Experience is horrible .. I called (10:55am) ahead so my food can be ready within 30 to 45 mins as I was advise it will take that long . When I got there 11:35am (I literally live down the street) I still waited  5  more mins just for the cashiers to tell me they gave my food away on another pick up order .. I was really looking forward   to eat a delicious breakfast  however  just get really upset &  disappointed 😔.</text>

(Translated by Google) Delicious, 3rd time in this place, and will be one of my favorites for breakfast, you have the option to change things on the menu, they serve you fast and are always attentive if you need something else 😎
