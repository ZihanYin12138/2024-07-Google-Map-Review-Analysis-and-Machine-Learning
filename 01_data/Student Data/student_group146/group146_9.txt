The ladies that work  here are very knowledgeable. I can always count on them to recommend the best for my baby when she's not feeling well.
I can truly say they care 💕
Thank you!</review>

Great place to take your pets. Wonderful staff, the owner is the "Bomb". She brings the happiness and love to the place. I've been going there for well over 10 years.  So I speak from my own experience. They also have a "Wellness Care Physician on site. She is very patient and knowledgeable as well.< /Review>

It doesn't  get any better than this Pet store.  Small store not like the big ones but has so much more in quality and definately something different.  Great service. The owners and staff are extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  I have learned more from them than the vet many times. Great choices in healthy foods for your pets.  A unique place. They also do grooming.  Seriously...go there and check it out.  You will be glad you did.< /text>

We always have a great experience here, 10+ years. This shop is a true gem. The groomers and staff remember our dog and always handle her with visible care. We love supporting small business owners whenever possible and can't recommend it enough. Grooming prices are beyond fair, so please tip well.< /Text>

Best pet store hands down. Amazing staff both in the shop and the grooming area! Everyone is super knowledgeable about the products they carry and the latest info on keeping our furry friends healthy. Everyone that I've spoken to has gone out of their way to help me with my questions and even help me find answers that may not include purchasing from their store. They truly care about the health and happiness of the animals that come in and it shows.  One of the grooming staff even showed me how to cut my dogs nails and was so helpful in teaching me the proper way to hold my dog and use the tools. SUPER APPRECIATED. They also have a wide variety of organic/natural/healthy pet foods in every kind of medium from canned to frozen, from kibble to freeze dried. Love this store and super grateful to have discovered it.<//Review>

<review>I would definitely return! One of the ladies help me chose a brand of dog food and supply me with samples! I explain to her the situation my husky was having and she was very helpful. As I was checking out the gentlemen was very friendly and we had a good conversation . I would definitely come back to support their business! Will recommend to anyone looking for the best healthy supplies for the fur ones 😃🐶🐱🐭<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

If I can add 10 Stars I would.
I have been going to this pet store for years and years, and no matter how far it is from where I live, I continue to go, and will not stop. Very friendly, understanding, loving, and most of all honest.... I wish I can write all the great stuff about it...
Shelley truly loves animals and proud to be so. You can tell that it's all about saving and the well being for them.
Not to forget Lisa and all of the employees of the store. I mean no matter how much they are extremely busy, they will take time to help.
Most of all, shelley has a holistic license for not only animals but for people. She knows what she is talking about, trust me.
Thank you for your Care and love shelley and all. Christine Sawaya 💓🙏<//Review>

Buy local!!! The employees are very knowledgeable and care. And that's what's important to me. They didn't try to push me into expensive purchases, they instead helped me find the right stuff and encouraged treatment options as well. They've made a customer for life.</review>

I would check all the options if I could: quality, value, professional, reliable & responsive. Always good grooms for my 2 special girls, Cocoa & Candy. Collar & Leash have been a neighborhood staple for longer than most stores in Garden Grove, like IHOP, oops, they aren't here any more. Give them a try and you'll be back.< /text>

<Review>I’ve been coming here for almost a month now n Debbie who’s very knowledgeable about my baby condition has been giving therapy to my Pug who’s  back leg has been dragging n he can’t walk on his own, she takes good care of my baby like if he was her own, she always makes him feel so comfortable, he loves her, all the staff are very friendly especially Shelly, she is the sweetest person n is always available to help you in any way she can, she loves my Tobey.  They have all kind of products for your pets needs, this is the best place I’ve ever been to that as soon as you walk in they make you feel comfortable, I thank God we found this place 🙏🐶👍😊💜</Review></record></dataset><record>

I Love the Staff at Collar and Leash.  Shelly is Amazing she can help you with your animals and she has Natural Supplements for you and your furry babies.  Too bad shes not in Riverside. She is in Garden grove on Chapman Ave.  Amazing Place they groom your fur babies as well. Debbie is Amazing as well.< /Text>

This is the most awesome place in all of Orange County to get your pet supplies. I have affordable high-end food and treats for your animals. I get my Fromm from here and it's cheaper here than on even Amazon. The staff is friendly helpful and very knowledgeable. You can also get your dog groomed here. I would recommend this place for anyone that has any questions regarding the wellness or taking care of your animal.
thank you collar and leash for helping me keep my 14 year old dog running around like a puppy.< /text>

<text>Absolutely will never get my pet supplies anywhere else! I just stopped by to get a can of cat food and not only did these lovely ladies inform me of the diets best suitable for my pets but they gave us samples to test out which flavors my kitties would like from the entire brand. They made us feel welcomed and have customer service like no other!<//text>< pictures>

The customer service though, for me at least, could have been better. They were a bit rude when I went in to do a return so I don't think I'll be back.</text>< Pics>

Hi I been wanting to write this for a couple of weeks. I never want to forget the last couple days I got to share with my baby girl Lilly. The collar and Leash told me what they think what went on throughout the years. And wow it made sense.
When I took her home we cuddle all day all night. I was honored to get to understand Lilly.
My family have been going to collar and Leash for about 25 yrs. This place is so awesome.</Review>

I don't hate the place, but my cat used to like to go there to be groomed, and now he won't let them touch him. I found a new place now. The staff isn't the friendliest, but the ladies in the front are always nice.</Text>

Love how they handle my cats. I have been coming here for years. Their grooming prices are great. Especially for kitties, it's almost always more expensive for cats at other places. The staff is awesome and genuinely friendly and seem to love what they do!< /Review>

<Text>A very great place to shop for your pet needs. To have your cat or dog groomed they do an excellent job. My Sam came out smelling clean and handsome. And since Sam has gone on to be with Jesus, I've got 2 other boys, (Maine Coons) in which Holly set me up with (she's an Angel) she takes great care of me and the boys. Thanks Holly and the entire staff at Collar & Leash. Moses and Joshua love ya.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Been coming to see Shelly at C&L for 6 years now and we are always super pleased to see our adorable fur babies! I love that they always add a festive bandana or bows - it's such a nice touch!

Im thinking others feel the same as I do though, because we are now having to call further in advance for an appointment - they fill up so fast! Keep up the great work guys.< /Review>

After several tries with a few unacceptable groomers we found Collar and Leash.   Our pets grooming is always excellent and  over the past 8 or so years they have always gone the extra mile helping us through allergies and other maladies with holistic ideas.  Such involvement and extra care is rare and we recommend this business 100% for all your needs.< /Review>

Pay attention to your pets when they put the skids on going into the back room. The attitude they show at the window is not reflected in the back grooming area. These people are mean to the dogs. That's why pets are so excited to see their owners when being picked up.</review>

<Date>1411430954956</Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>We had tried numerous groomers in the area of Garden Grove/Cypress and been disappointed with each shop for various reasons.  Then we discovered Collar and Leash and our pet found a home for his grooming needs.  They do a marvelous job and our pet is comfortable being brought to their grooming area.

Further the store itself has a good selection of pet items but the best thing is any problem our Buddy has had they have advice that just fits the bill.  Everyone is so helpful and has genuine concern for the pets brought here as well.

This place is a 5 Star plus and we highly recommend them.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>This is the best place by far you will ever have your dog/cat groomed or serviced. Customers who don't have a positive experience should probably seek owner's referral to further assist them in finding a better quality and price of services rendering because I am certain she will help in any way possible to take care of your family's pets. This family owned business deserves all the credit and kudos they have been in business forever-- I recommend giving your bad experience a rest because you  will not find another mom and pop service and commitment like this one anywhere else in orange county.Either that, or do it yourself-- but for affordable quality bathing this is your best option no matter what !<//Text><gmapID>0x80dd285d7c2a37d7:0xe87bc48c6d8f96ce<//gmapID>< pictures>

< Review>
Our 3 dogs have not been serviced anywhere else,,,and I would not take them anywhere else !! It's been years of great service they have provided us(and the doggies ,of course)and the doggies are always calm and content when we pick them back up.Staff is courteous and knowledgeable about all matters and very willing to help.I am now on Social Security,and hard for me to pay Vet bills.Collar and Leash always has a solution for me to use/try at home ! Usually they hit the nail on the head,and happy doggies again.....Give them a try.You will not regret it !< /Review>

<Text>They are the friendliest, most knowledgeable, caring group of people. They love the animals just as much if not more than the owners. The sell top quality food. Their service is suberb, Totally recommend this pet store to anyone. Glad we are a customer and now friends, Love that they introduced us to the assessment test to get the food allergeries under control, I highly recommend this to everyone. We don't shop anywhere else. Bentley says thank you too, Ruff Ruff</Text>< Pics>

I was kind of hesitant at first because it didn't seem very organized, but they did a way better job at grooming my pup than Petco did, and they charged me about $20 less than Petco too!
I did the full package and got charged about $40 and every dollar was worth it! Definitely recommend, I'm for sure going back.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I've had good experience here with the staff. My dog was allergic to his food as I explained the problem the staff recommended the food for my dog and he was well within 2 weeks. First bird cookie, collar and Steelers jersey I bought here. Love how they greated my baby with a treat.< /text>

<text>Update: 10/13/17.... this store is still as wonderful n even better! My pit has a food allergy. I told t owner about it n immediately she showed me a couple of food that could work for my baby! I walked outta there w t right food my my bb, samples n feeling fantastic! The costomer service that this store provides is amazing! Love love this place, highly recommend it..

I love this store! I haven't been here in a long long time but every time I pass by it I smile... The staff is AMAZING! Everyone is so loving, knowledgeable about the products n about what ur pets may need. Omg do they know there stuff n even if they r not sure they go n ask n come back w full details about it.. If they don't have an item they order it for u n boom is there to b picked up right away.. They have such great things for ur furry children, holistic meds, oils, treats n so so much more... Is like Trader Joe's, Mothers Market and everywhere they sell organic store but for pets! They really love ur pets n u feel welcome here... I LOVE THIS PLACE! BEST PLACE EVER!!</text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Well, this place has been arround since I was a kid(45 now) with the same owner. Taking that into consideration on top of the fact an evil corperation/big box petstore retailer exists across the street yet Collar and leash is still there, that really says something. When most smaller buisness(owned by an individual not a corperation) in America are forced to close down due to unfair practices, mass buying power and other advantages used by corperations this place is still here ! So as a customer that pleases me. The employees know what they are talking about, when it comes to your pets health and well being. And prices are suprisinly fair! THE BIGEST THING (I feel) IS THEY HELP OUT ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY FREE IF THEY ARE LOW OR OUT OF PET FOOD! So,take that one in the neck PETCO!</review>

As a first time furniture shopper, I couldn’t be happier with the bedroom set and mattress I bought. The furniture is great quality for a great price. The owner was very helpful and gave me the best possible deal. They even deliver and set up the furniture. I really do recommend coming here for any furniture needs.< /Review>

This local furniture store is a great asset of Santa Rosa. Exquisite collections, a lot of options and great quality. Chavez is awesome; professional and great customer service. He gave me a great deal on my choices and delivered very next day. Moving further this store will be always my first stop for my all furniture needs.

Highly recommended 👌 👍< /Text>

My wife and I have purchased furniture here for many years. We have bought several dressers, cabinets and king/queen bed frames for very inexpensive prices. The quality of the furniture is very excellent and durable. We will continue to buy furniture here & will recommend our friends and family. Thank you guys!<//Text>

I just recently moved off campus from SSU, and I saw Tu Casa's ads around the area and Internet. I went in and right away Danny helped me. Super friendly guy, with plenty of options to choose from. He understood I was a student, so he helped me with my budget and everything. HUGE steal from other brand name stores. Highly recommend for students looking to move off-campus and get a great 4/5/6 piece for such a great deal. Would definitely go back and buy more stuff for the rest of my house. Love my new set-up in my room, and couldn't be happier. Thanks Danny!< /review>

We walked in and found a couch really quickly for a great price. They did charge quite a bit to deliver it, but it came on time and in great condition. The delivery guys were really nice too.</Text>

Had to fix an issue with my bedroom set and was given the best customer service I’ve received compared to any other furniture stores, instead of having to wait 30 min plus to get the issue resolved it took no more than 6-8 mins to have it resolved  truly great customer service indeed, shows that they really care for their customers.<//text>

We went in very late at night and Chavez helped us. He was so patient and listened to our needs to find us the right size in furniture. They have a wide selection to chose from, bedroom, living room, kitchen.  Not only that, he gave us excellent pricing and worked with our schedule for the delivery.  I would highly recommend anyone looking for any type of furniture to go to Tu Casa Furniture and ask for Chavez. Excellent service!<//review>

Very nice staff. Always friendly whenever i come here. Tea selection is great! I love the royal rose tea with the strawberry popping pearls. The basil popcorn chicken is really good!! Mmm, makes me hungry just thinking about it.<//Review>

I don't know why everyone is saying good staff. I went there and the waitress was on her phone to start and the music. The music was AWFUL and I am not saying I did not like it (but I did not) It was blasting bad words like crazy and my 8 year old brother was there! I also ordered a taro milk tea and got a red bean milk tea or something like that. They also refused to take it back!<//Review>

<Text>This is a wonderful little milk tea shop. I think it opened 2 years ago and my wife and I have been going ever since. Today, she got soy milk in green tea and it was delicious. I got a salted caramel milk shake and it was at least as good. Highly recommend.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I was introduced to this place from a friend yesterday. The moment I walked in, they welcomed us in and it looked overall cleaned. They have wide choice of selection to choose from. I highly recommend the POPCORN CHICKEN and ONION RINGS!

By far my favorite place in Morgan Hill and San Jose too!</Text>

T4 is your standard, reliable tea shop. The flavors really came through even at less sweetness!

Loved their jasmine milk tea with grass jelly. I got this and a roasted oolong milk tea with pearls and both were good. I wish I lived closer, I would definitely stop by for my boba fixes.

Service was friendly. It did take longer than I expected with one customer in the shop besides me but I think they had a complicated order. Thanks T4!</text>

<Review>This is the second time I've been to a T4. The first was in Palo Alto. Wasn't too crazy about that location. Their customer service skills left a lot to be desired. Decided to give the Morgan Hill a try since I was wanting a Boba Smoothie. I'm glad I did. I was greeted right away which is a nice change from the previous location. We tried the Lychee smoothie with boba, honey peach smoothie with boba and the 6-piece takoyaki. Although the smoothies were more like slushies, the flavors were very good. Will definitely come back to try more flavors.<//Review>< resp>

Moved to Morgan Hill from San Jose and went hunting for good boba in the area. Tried 3 places in one day to compare, and this one is hands-down the best! I was worried there wouldn't be a good boba option outside San Jose, and I'm happy to be wrong.< /Text>

<Text>Decent pearl milk tea and clean environment. Same standard as other similar establishments north of Morgan Hill. Come to think of it, the opening of this place may have caused the closure of the Bee’s Tea place in the Target Plaza. Being closer to busy lunchtime restaurants and Anritsu et al, they may have a greater likelihood for staying in business here.<//Text>< Pics>

No pressure. They will find you a discount and make car buying a pleasant experience. They are helpful and will bring the car straight to your home without a fee. You never have to set foot in the dealership. What more can you ask for? Give them a call.</Review>

I only have positive things to say about the experience and would use them again. They made car purchasing very easy and it was a lot less stressful than going through a dealer. I 100% recommend them! You will not regret it.
I think once you go through Okuma it will be difficult to go back to a dealer....we were referred to them by family/friends and we all now have cars brokered through Okuma.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1611712774769, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your business and review Ivette.

This was my first car buying experience and I was referred to Larry at Okuma for some help. I thought I could do this on my own so I went to the dealership and boy was I wrong. I had a horrible experience there so I immediately called up Larry and he sprang into action. He found me my car within a day and at a great deal. I was driving it the next week! Seriously, if you want a no stress car buying experience, use these guys. They're the best!< /Text>

We  needed new car and was not looking forward in haggling with car dealers- Terrible experiences.  But with Okuma, it was so simple. We told Larry what make model and what price we wanted to pay.

<Time>1615593425920<//Time><rating>5<//rating><text>Happy customer since 2018 and contacted Zina to help me find a lease car that could be used in the HOV lane as a single vehicle occupant. She helped me lease a 2018 Honda Clarity and it was effortless. I did not have to spend hours contacting dealerships, making cold calls or trying to haggle my lease agreements. She took the stress out of my car shopping experience. I was so pleased with my 1st lease that I contacted her again in 2021 to purchase another lease. This time she found an AMAZING deal for the 2020 Chevy Bolt! I was so pleased with the easiness of the process and service. Also, I traded in our 2017 Toyota Camry SE and got a great value for the car. During COVID-19, Zina helped me out tremendously. If you want no BS, honest advice and someone who will help you through the complex process, I recommend Okuma Enterprises. Thank you so much Zina!< /text>< pictures>

Larry from Okuma Enterprises made the purchase of my 2021 Lexus NX very easy.  Larry was able to find the car of my choice with all my desired specification at a much lower rate than what I was quoted initially when trying to purchase on my own.  I was able to handle all the paperwork for the car at home. The car was delivered to me and the dealer set up all of the features of my new ride. I didn't have to worry about a thing. During this time of Covid, it seems like the safest way to purchase a new vehicle.</text>

Came in today for my second treatment of partial laser and I love it! Everyone is very kind. I asked questions and she was helpful. And I'm excited to see results when I'm done with all my sessions.<//Review>

<Review>Larry Oshima with Okuma Enterprises is AMAZING!  With his assistance, my husband is the proud new owner of a 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 and he is IN LOVE!  Larry went above and beyond to find our truck, kept us informed and provided helpful advice.  In addition, we benefited from the strong relationship he has with dealerships.  This was the easiest car buying experience we ever had!  We couldn't be happier with Larry and Okuma Enterprises.  Give them a call, you won't be sorry!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Leasing my new car with Larry from Okuma's help was the best experience I've had leasing my new car and I've previously leased a car through another leasing company.  To my luck the previous car broker I had gone to moved too far for me where I had to look for another broker and found Larry.  I wish I would have found Okuma when I leased my first car.

Larry was extremely helpful, always available to answer my questions by email, text, or phone keeping me updated and making the process easy and stress free.  Larry was able to help me get the exact car I wanted, and I know he got me the best deal possible. So happy I found Okuma.  I will definitely be returning to Larry for any future cars and highly recommend to others if you are looking to lease or purchase your car I recommend you contact Okuma</Review>< time>

Okuma Enterprises made buying my new minivan so convenient and easy! No sitting around in a dealership for hours negotiating a price and filling out tons of paperwork. I chose what I wanted and Okuma found it for me at a great price, then delivered it and the paperwork right to me!< /text>

Kudos and many thanks to Okuma and specifically, Larry Oshima.

After a recent auto accident, I found myself in need of a new car. After researching the different Toyota Hybrid models, I landed on the Camry Hybrid XLE with all the bells and whistles. I have used Okuma in the past for several purchases and requested a quote online on the Okuma website.

That same morning I received an email acknowledging my request and that Larry would be assigned to me. After a quick phone call with Larry to go over everything I wanted, the search began.

Just a short 2 hours later, Larry called and found my vehicle for near dealer invoice. A few minutes after that, a Toyota credit application was sent. After all the formalities and approval, the car was purchased and delivered to my workplace 3 days later. I should note that the 3 day delay was due to my job demands and a credit freeze that I had placed on my SS #.

In total, maybe 1.5 hours in time was taken for this purchase. Okuma saved me money and time. Great service!

Again, thank you Okuma and Larry. What a wonderful experience!< /text>

I was looking to buy a car since the incentives are so good right now, but did not enjoy the experience dealing with each individual online sales manager. Friend recommended Okuma, and it was a breeze to work with them. I wanted a very specific model, but never did they seem annoyed with my requests. I never once felt pressured to buy. Will definitely buy my next car through them! Also they offer discounts on accessories and parts, so I will use them for that service as well.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< user_name>

Now getting a car has NEVER been a fav activity for me, it pushes all my buttons. But Michael Dang is the man that got me through it with excellent service and assistance. I could not have asked for a more calm, experienced, straight talking sales person. I love my new Rav4, love the service and loved the price they were able to work out for me!!!! Thank you so so much!!!! GO SEE MICHAEL!!!!< /Text>

This is our third purchase with Okuma.  Larry Oshima was great to work with.  Having had a prior experience of purchasing at a dealership, it is much less stressful and easy to work with Larry at Okuma Enterprises.  I knew what I wanted, he searched and found the car, and best of all, at a great price.  Go Okuma!!!<//review>

I purchased my last three cars through Okuma Enterprises and each time, they have been very accommodating, knowledgeable and efficient.  I recently purchased a 2020 Subaru Outback Limited XT and Larry was able to find the exact car I wanted in just a couple of days even though the inventory on the new Outbacks was very low, and Larry was still able to find the car below the sticker price.  Not having to go through all of the headache, negotiations and paperwork transactions with the dealerships first hand makes the experience purchasing a car through Okuma even more worthwhile.<//Text>

<Text>Okuma is the best. I started my car search in the end of 2019 and after changing my mind a few times I finally decided on my car and Larry found it. Larry was very patient with me over the past few months and was a complete joy to work with. He never rushed or pushed me and made the whole car buying experience a breeze. I will always go through Okuma on any future car purchases. Thanks Larry!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1582224809422, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your business and review Will. Enjoy your new car.'}< /Response>< userid>

If I could give Okuma 10 stars I would! I just had the best car buying experience possible with no hassle and no sales pitch from the dealership. I had been looking for a particular car for some time now and none of the local dealers could find it for me. After contact with Ray Ortiz with Okuma, he was able to find me the exact car I wanted. After signing a few papers, I was handed the keys to my new car! No hassle, no negotiations and at a great price! Ray then went over all of the features of the car with me in detail and assured me he was but a phone call away with any further questions I had. He was absolutely the best! Thank you Ray and Okuma for your outstanding service! I love my new car!< /Text>

This is how car buying should be. Ken Koshiro from Okuma made the process super easy and pleasant. I told him the make, model, color and options I wanted (which I knew would be a difficult to find) and Ken found exactly what I wanted at a good deal. To make things better they even gave me a good deal on my old car so I wouldn't have to hassle with selling it myself. I'll be going back to Okuma and Ken when I'm ready to replace my other car.</review>

<review>Buying a car is not something that I enjoy.  However, whenever I do buy one, I go through Okuma. This is the third time I've used them and it is so easy.  Just tell Larry exactly what you want and he will find it for you and do all the work.  I even referred my brother to Larry and he wondered why he never used them before.  Thank you!< /review>< pictures>

<review>It's my fortune to come to know about Okuma Enterprises. I had never used a car broker, but because of 5 stars review on them, I stopped by their office without appointment.  Brian was there for me, and we started a leisurely conversation like being in my living room. The next day he found a car exactly I wanted, which was only one left in Southern Ca, with a great deal(saved $5,700)! Then I went to his office just to sign the papers and pick up my new car. Usually they deliver your new car to your house or office but not in my case due to the driver's schedule. Everything is easy and smooth, and my experience with Okuma is so comfortable like flying first class. I definitely use Okuma again. Thank you, Brian.</review><username>Yoshi<//username><Response>{'time': 1512506541421, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review Yoshi.

The process and overall experience was fantastic.  Ken was extremely responsive to all my queries and was very informative and helpful.  This was my first experience working with a broker and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  It really took the stress out of car buying and I was extremely pleased with type of car I got as well as its price point.<//Text>

First time buying a car and let me just say using a broker is the way to go! My family used Okuma before and they loved it so I decided to give it try especially since I was trying to buy a car while I was still away at school. Everything worked out so perfectly and the stress of buying my first car was so much easier with the help from Okuma. If you get the chance to work with Ken Koshiro you're in for a great experience. He made the whole process so easy and simple and found me the perfect car in my budget! He truly cares about helping you find the right car and making the process as simple as can be. I highly recommend Okuma especially Ken!! I am definitely going to use Okuma again in the future!!<//Text>

<Review>This was my second time purchasing a car through a car broker and Okuma Enterprises did not disappoint. I called and spoke to Ken about the car I wanted, a Toyota Prius Prime, and he worked his magic to get me the best price. There was no haggling, out of pocket fees, or hidden cost. Ken answered all my questions and was very responsive. Within a few days, I was meeting Ken at the dealership (I believe it may have been his day off) and he went over everything we discuss; there were no surprises. We were in and out in about an hour.  I am so happy with my purchase and the process of getting the car worked out nicely. Okuma Enterprises, because of Ken, will have a customer for life.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOHqJizoqzRbm3VtYsxLYcE2m3V5GLcy2sNRr8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

Okuma Enterprises is the way to go when you are searching for a new car! Ken was amazing to work with and helped me find the exact car I wanted, all while negotiating an incredible price for me. I couldn’t be happier with the outcome and their hassle free and professional service. I won’t be stepping into a dealership again! Would 100% recommend/ refer Okuma Enterprises.</text>

They even saved be $1,000 by informing me of a financing option that i was not aware of.  Thank you.  I would totally use them again.<//review>< pictures>

My family and I have been getting our cars through Okuma for over 20 years mind you we get new cars every 3 years, sometimes two or more. Zina and her family are so informative, and are always looking out for what is best for us. We couldn't be happier with the service they have provided for us over the years. There is no other way we would rather buy/lease a car then through Okuma. They make the process so easy from picking the car out, finance, to delivery! Best service anyone could ask for! Definitely not like your typical car salesmen. We highly recommend Okuma for your next car purchase!< /text>

This is our third car we have purchased from Larry at Okuma Enterprises. The primary reason we always deal with Okuma is that we don't have to haggle with the sales force at a dealership in order to receive a great deal.  As long as you know what you are looking for, Okuma will find the auto you are looking for and will get you a excellent price.  An additional bonus is that the car is delivered to your house.

Believe it or not, we bought this car without leaving the house (other than visiting a dealer to look over the car we wanted).  We called our credit union and they sent loan papers via email using an electronic signature feature.   We then called Okuma and told them our requirements for the car.  Okuma came back with an excellent quote and we told them we would purchase it.  Larry at Okuma delivered the car to our house and we signed the purchase agreement which we then forwarded a copy to the credit union.  Everything was handled without leaving the house. The car was ordered on Thursday and it was delivered the following Tuesday.  The majority of time between was spent playing email tag with the credit union.  We didn't think it could be done but we actually didn't have to leave the house. Pretty darn easy, maybe too easy.</text>

<Text>I am so happy with the service and overall experience with Okuma. I was referred to them when a friend of the family heard I was looking to lease a car. These are the people you don't think you need but you do! Larry made it the whole process so much better than any dealership. He was honest, helpful, answered all my questions and worked to get the best deal for my budget. Larry even worked with me and was able shop around when I wasn't 100% sure which car would be the best option of me. Give them a try and you will not be disappointed.< /Text>< gmapID>

Through the years, we often heard such great things about Okuma.  Now, we can personally attest to the ease and efficiency of working with Okuma!  We had the pleasure of working with Larry Oshima on a recent purchase.  Larry made the whole transaction so easy!  We told him which cars we were interested in and he found a few options for us to choose from.  Great price. Great service.  We recommend Okuma Enterprises.< /text>

<Review>I refer Okuma to all my friends and family. I have been leasing my cars through Okuma for almost 10 years now. They make car buying/ leasing a piece of cake! All you have to tell them is the year, make, model, color, and all the must have accessories, down payment amount, and monthly payments and they'll do all the work to find the car. Their company removes the stress and saves you time. There is no fee like the other car brokers out there and they deliver. What else can you ask for!

Thank you Zina, Jay, and Garrett!</Review><response>{'time': 1507250980230, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review Kimmie.  And yes, we are one of the few Car Brokers in Los Angeles that does not charge any fees to our clients.. Enjoy your new Lexus.'}</response>< userid>

I have purchased and leased several vehicles over the years from this company. (I really can't stand the dealership experience). I have ALWAYS had a great experience with Okuma. Ending with a car delivered to my doorstep! I would happily recommend Larry Oshima and the team at Okuma! Larry is a great guy and has got us great deals every time. Always follows up with calls and delivers great service. I trust these guys in a car buying world that is full of sharks and fine print to look out for. He is straight forward with the facts and will get you the best deal he can offer. I will no doubt be calling them for my next car as well.<//Review>

I was referred to Okuma through a couple of friends. This was our first time using a broker and the overall experience was excellent! The short version: the process could not be easier and I had a better feeling compared to dealing with the dealership directly after the purchase. Got a good discount and the vehicle was delivered to our home, which was very convenient! Planning on returning next time we need a vehicle!

The detailed version: Went to the company’s website and filled out an application (previous night). One of the brokers (Ken) called me back the next day asking for a few more details about what features we were looking for on the car. Also asked what dealerships we visited and if we already test drove a car (so he could make it clear to the dealer he wasn’t stealing us away from them). At the time we had a vehicle to trade in/sell. A form was e-mailed us shortly asking for some information regarding the condition of the car and a few pictures. Within a day or two, Ken called back saying there was a car available and quoted us a price that was about $3K less than sticker price. We needed some time to look into our financial details and complete the form for trading in/selling the car. After we finally analyzed our expenses, we told Ken we were willing to go through with the purchase (ended up not using Okuma to sell our car, not on them at all). Got one more call from Ken confirming details regarding delivery and telling me there was an extra option being included in on the car, no charge. The dealer claims they forgot to tell Ken about it, which would normally increase the price. But Ken told them we were already quoted so the dealer didn’t push back. On the day of delivery, Ken showed up along with the new car, we went through the paperwork in our home, and the transaction was complete. Overall the speed of the transaction and convenience was great! Ken was a pleasure to work with and I hope he’s still there next time we need a vehicle! The only time Ken made any type of pressuring comment was to save us money (interest rates would be rising soon and he didn’t want us paying more than we should) and I appreciate him looking out for us.  For those who want to avoid the horrible feeling you get after talking with someone at a dealership, I would definitely recommend using Okuma.</Text>

<review>My Wife and I just had a baby and we did not have the time or energy to sit in the dealership and haggle for the best price. A friend referred me to Okuma and a guy named Larry. I told Larry what I wanted and what I got was an upgrade for the same price and budget I had requested. Everything was easy and when the car came it was perfect. I am very pleased and will use them in the future. Try it out you won't be disappointed. Thank you again Larry and Okuma.< /review>< Name>

Convenience and customer service are extremely important to me and Okuma shines in both areas. Not only did they check multiple sources to find me the best price on the exact vehicle that I was looking for, but they also helped me get the lowest interest rate possible! The best part of it all was all I had to do was make a simple phone call. No going from dealership to dealership, no shopping around and negotiating and they also have all the paperwork ready for me to sign upon delivery. That's right, they will DELIVER the car straight to your door! Okuma has made the process of buying a car as seamless as possible and the most cost efficient. Definitely a win-win!< /review>

It is such a pleasant experience for us, I was a bit skeptical even after reading all the good reviews because I am in east coast and would want to have the car ready at a specific time when we are in LA and setup the whole thing without seeing the car and the Okuma representative Larry in person. But from the beginning to the end, everything went smoothly, we got the car we want within our expected budget, Larry was great and totally ceased my anxiety.

<text>Coming from the Huntington Beach area, I’m used to higher prices for cars at most dealerships around me so I decided I’d give an auto broker a try. I looked up the best one on yelp with the best reviews. Okuma Enterprises, inc. was the top of the list. I decided to try them out and I ended up buying a used 2014 Lexus RX350 for a cheaper price and lower mileage than most dealers would have given me. Larry my auto broker even delivered the car all the way to my work in Irvine so I didn’t even have to lose a day. I’m going to tell everybody I know about them.</text>< gmap_id>

We have had Larry's help at Okuma for quite a few years. We bought  at least 5 vehicles via Larry's help. Now my own son is going through Larry to purchase his new car.

As a web savvy shopper, I went on-line and searched for new car prices and new car purchase services often and I always come back to Okuma because of its hassle-free and straightforward approach with personal touches.

Yes, I would highly recommend this company as a whole and Larry in specific for car buying services.</review>

<Review>This was our first experience going through a broker and now I can't imagine going through the process any other way!! We priced out our car through Costco but Brian Misawa found us exactly what we wanted and saved us a bundle AND delivered the car! We only set foot into the dealership to test drive and check out the car in person.  We emailed Brian what we were looking for at what price on Saturday, and by Monday afternoon he had found our car! Because of his relationship with the dealership, he was also able to get the roof racks and rails quickly installed, and he and a Honda employee were in our driveway with our new car Tuesday evening! The Honda employee went over all the features, synced my phone to the car,  went over the paperwork, and they were gone all within an hour! Brian even gave us a discount AND delivered the extra accessories we wanted (seat covers and cargo floor mat).  For a mother of two with a third on the way, this was by far the best way to go.  I highly recommend Brian and Okuma Enterprises to anyone in the market for a new or used car!

<Review>I have used Okuma Enterprises for over 10 years and would recommend their services if you are in the market for a new car. The staff is very friendly and will do their best to find the "exact" make/model you're looking for quickly. If you're like me, I hate to deal directly with the negotiating and dealer pressures to add options. With a broker, I don't deal with any of that and you know exactly what your price will be out the door. They will deliver the car to your front door as well.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1486075578287, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review Steve.

I've always seen many Okuma license plate frames on cars over the years and now I know why. There's a reason why they have been in business this long. They value long-term relationships with not only their clients but they also have great working relationships with the car dealers. This is not easy and can only be accomplished by the company's values and the employees that work at Okuma.

Larry Oshima helped me with the lease of a new Lexus. He found a buyer for my current lease and brokered a deal with the dealer on my new car. The final sale price would have taken me several hours of intense negotiating. The entire process from first phone call to having a new car in my driveway took about a week. The actual taking delivery of the car took less than 30 minutes.

Highly recommended. Thanks!< /text>< rating>

I was told by 3 different dealers that the car I wanted to surprise my husband with was not available and would need to be "special ordered" with a 8-10 week delivery time which wouldn't work and then I remembered Okuma Enterprises from 35 years ago - called and I got Larry to help with the task.  Larry was not only professional, efficient, and courteous but had the car delivered in 1 week!   Okuma and Larry - you rock!  Thank you - and my husband REALLY thanks you!<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>As we started doing our research to buy our very first car, we found the folks at Okuma Enterprises while searching for dealerships. We had never heard of auto brokers before, and were initially quite dubious because it sounded too good to be true--someone else does the legwork of buying a car, with no fees? Seemed fishy. But after speaking with our rep Brian, we knew that we'd happened upon a gold mine.

Brian was professional, knowledgeable, patient, and extremely helpful. You don't often find competence and personality in one (you have to pick one over the other) but Brian was that unicorn. It was like having a close family member be an advocate for you during the car buying process. Whether you'll needa bit of hand holding like us, or have done some research on your own, having someone like Brian by your side gives you the peace of mind that the huge purchase you’re making is done right. Can’t thank Brian and the team at Okuma for the easiest, most efficient, and serene car buying experience ever!

Most importantly, we have a car guy now. Everyone needs a car guy.</Text>< pictures>

Larry at Okuma worked so hard to find the exact car I was looking for at the best price. I tried the online services, but Larry got us the best deal. All my future car purchase will be with Okuma!</review>

Love Okuma! I've used them twice and had such good experiences both times. They got me the exact car I wanted at a great price. I worked with Larry who went above and beyond to really help me out. Have already recommended them to friends and will definitely use them again in the future.</text>

< Review>
I did not want a new car. My beloved 2015 Prius had been totaled by a drunk driver, and I was still in shock. A friend connected me with Larry at Okuma, who made the process of purchasing a new Prius not only painless, but actually pleasant. He was responsive and personable and went out of his way to locate the exact car I'd chosen and the best deal, even arranging for it to be transported in from another state. I would unhesitatingly recommend Okuma to any prospective car buyer.< /Review>

<Text>Brian Misawa at Okuma Enterprises was really helpful in our car purchase process.  He made the experience of buying our 2016 Honda Pilot hassle free and fast.  I simply told him the model, trim and color plus indicated that I wanted financing.  Within a week or maybe just a little over we got our new car.  To top it all off, Brian delivered the car to us.  Thank you Brian!< /Text>< time>

There is no other way to buy a car. Larry provided an exceptional and personalized customer service experience. Larry knew exactly how to help me through the stages of my decision-making process. His extensive experience working with buyers was evident. The value-added that Larry brought to the buying experience was incomparable and I would without any reservation recommend Okuma Enterprises, Inc.</text>

This is the third vehicle we have purchased from Okuma.  Larry is just the best.  Takes care of every little detail from the beginning of the purchase through the end, and then continues to check on us periodically.  This is by far the best way to purchase a car and I highly recommend them when buying your next vehicle.</review>

So easy buying a car using Okuma. We told Brian what we wanted, he found it and got us  a great deal.  Then, instead of sitting in a car dealership waiting around he brought the car and paperwork to our house and we finalized everything in comfort.  The only way to buy a car!< /Review>

< review>
Okuma Enterprises and Larry Oshima were the best car buying experience that I have ever had.  They were recommended to me by my sister and brother when they found out I was looking for a new car.  At first I was hesitant because I always bought a car the old fashioned way by going into several dealers and dealing for the best price.  I will never do that again.  Larry found a great deal for me and did all of the work.  He kept me informed of the status of his work and actually delivered before the promised date.  All of the paperwork was done and ready for my signature.  I only had to sign and drive my car home.  Our next purchase will be for a new car for my wife next year.  Larry will be my only option.  Thanks again to Larry and Okuma Enterprises.</review>

<Text>I have used Okuma Enterprises Inc for over 20 years to buy and lease my cars.  This is the best company to do business with.  I've dealt with Zina, the owner of the company and with many Okuma employees.  Believe me when I say, they will make buying or leasing a car an enjoyable experience and will save you $$$.  They have always delivered my cars to me in perfect condition and with everything I ask for.  Don't hesitate to contact them for your next car.  Oh, and in a couple of months I'm ordering my next new car from Okuma.  And as an update to this post from 5 months ago,  I have received my new car couldn't be happier.</Text>< Resp>

I am not one to post an experience but I wanted to let people know this is a "Hassle Free" way to buy a car.
I have been to  dealerships, where the salesmen are ready to give you "Such a deal.....don't worry"....the numbers  were not there, you end up spending all day there and there is no there there!
At Okuma, customer service is the priority and Larry Oshima is the best.  Such a time saver and a positive way to buy a car.</text>

<review>Larry Oshima took care of me like I was a long lost member of the family. No hassling with a dealer, no cooling my heels for hours on the lot wondering what they were cooking up in the sales office to squeeze more money out of the transaction. And the car was delivered to my front door, tax, tag and title all taken care of. Okuma is a real find--I'd never buy a car the old way again. This is the only way to go.<//review>< resp>

Our family has used Okuma enterprises to buy cars for over ten years (2 Infinitis, 2 Lexus, 1 Subaru, 1 Scion) and have always been very pleased with their service. They are friendly and quick and always get us amazing deals, with no pressure. I also really admire their integrity. When we purchased our first Lexus, Zina quoted me a price and we agreed to it. Before any paper work was signed though, she called me back and said she found the car for $500 cheaper. So she re-sent the paperwork with the lower price. Before purchasing my current Lexus, I asked Larry for advice on different cars and models and he provided honest feedback and did not try to up sell me on a more expensive car. We don't even bother talking to a dealer anymore when looking for a new car -- we go directly to Okuma</text>

AWESOME SERVICE!!!  Wouldn't buy a car from anywhere else!  Zina and everyone at Okuma Enterprises is so knowledgeable, professional and their attention to detail is second to none!  My whole family, co-workers and friends have all bought their cars / SUV's from them.  It's so hassle free, no dealership / salesman to deal with and better pricing!  Can't beat that!  You save time, better price and its' DELIVERED!!!!   Seriously would not consider buying anywhere else.  Okuma is AMAZING!!!  Thank you!!!</Text>

Went to a dealer looking for a BMW 3 Series and got nowhere.  Contacted Okuma Enterprises and spoke with Brian Misawa.  I had my new car in one day at a great price!  Best thing is he delivered the car to my home free of charge.  Only way to buy a car!< /review>

I bought my 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid from Okuma Enterprises. I already knew exactly what model and color I wanted so they helped me track down the best price – beating the quotes I got from Toyota dealerships by a long shot. Made my car shopping experience a breeze!</review>

<Text>What’s great about Okuma is that they have been around for about 55 years and they were the first Auto broker in existence at the time, so they know the ins and outs within the car business to help find you the best deals. Larry Oshima helped my mom buy a 2008 Nissan Altima years ago and just recently he found me a used 2015 Lexus IS250 with less than 20k miles for a great price. He helped us with everything we needed and I highly recommend him. He has been with Okuma for a while and I’m glad I put my trust into him and Okuma Enterprises in general.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Best broker out there!
I've received multiple quotes from different dealers and Zina beat all of their prices. Not only are her prices unbeatable, she is extremely responsive. You are missing out on a hassle free car buying experience. Please stop wasting your time at dealerships and use Okuma Enterprises.< /review>

Hate dealing with pushy car sales people? This is definitely where you want to go then.

We live in Orange County, but had been in touch with Larry through the whole car-buying ordeal. Honestly, I can't say enough good things about working with him on getting my new VW Golf!! Within the week of deciding which car I wanted to purchase, he found a dealership that had the exact car and got a great deal on it for me. This is on top of the super friendly and quick responses to any questions/concerns I had. To add to his (already) awesome customer service, he even made sure to come earlier than the car sales guy to make sure they got the right house when they HOME DELIVERED my car!

Can't thank you guys enough for making buying a car so painless & stress free!!<//review>

Many of our families and friends have been using Okuma for a long time. We contacted them online and Larry Oshima got in touch with us within an hour (in the early evening after work hours!). The next day he got back to us with several options that fit what we were looking for! He was very friendly and explained the process clearly to us, as we had never leased before. Within a week after contacting them, the car and paperwork were delivered to our house. We plan to use Okuma for all our future automobile needs. Thanks Larry and Okuma!< /Text>

We all know how much time one can waste in searching for a new car - not to mention the stress and aggravation from dealing with sales people at dealership. Fortunately, a friend of mine recommended Larry Oshima at Okuma Enterprises, and I must say the entire experience was very pleasant, time-saving, and stress-free. I told Larry I was interested in a 2017 Toyota Camry with the accessories I wanted, he went to work and found the car promptly. He then gave me all the relevant information: price of the car after discount, terms, and monthly payment amount. He had all the paperwork ready for me to sign when I picked up my car (he will also deliver the car to you if you prefer). There was no last-minute surprise, bait & switch, up-selling, etc. From now on I will always go to  Larry Oshima @ Okuma Enterprises whenever I need a car. I'm glad I did, and so will you!<//text>

I worked with Zina to get my current car after a friend referred me to her. I could not be more pleased with her services. She was prompt in her replies and in getting me the information i needed. She was able to locate my exact car specification in a matter of hours and we completed the transaction in about 2 hours next day. She was able to negotiate a better deal for me at the same dealership for the same car i had negotiated. The icing on the cake was the after sales support. I wanted extra items which were not in stock and she made sure i got them in the time i was promised.

Use Zina @ Okuma Enterprises for your car shopping needs !</Text>

We had an excellent experience with Ken and his team!  My husband and I went out and road tested the car we were interested in and despite the dealership trying to get us to sign contract before we left, my husband called Ken and gave him the car info, (including price) and Ken did it!  He brought the car to our home, super easy quick signatures, and we were done! Because we went thru Ken, we were able to get a much better auto financing deal thru our credit union (for a new car), vs having to go thru Nissan for 3 mos then transferring over to our credit union (for a higher 'used' car rate). It was a great experience, we will definitely use Ken and Okuma for all future auto purchases!!</text>

My friend told me about this place. At first, I was skeptical because I had to put my blind faith into the employees in hopes that they would get me the right car without me seeing it firsthand, unlike at a dealership; however, it was beyond a wonderful experience and I’m glad I trusted them with what I want. They take away your worries and headaches right from the moment you speak to them.</text>

Buying a new car can be stressful, but Mr. Oshima definitely went out of his way to ensure the process went as quickly and as smoothly as possible.  The turnaround between committing to the purchase and getting my new car was incredibly fast—about two weeks.  I know that it can’t always be that easy, so I appreciate that he got me my car (in the color I wanted) as quickly as he did.  Throughout the process, he was always willing to work around my busy schedule.  He arranged a delivery that worked better for me than it probably did for him (driving long distances in the rain on a weekend).  He also ensured that the paperwork didn’t become a hassle, going so far as to allow me to text in required documents.  His email responses were always polite and timely, and in person he was likewise personable and respectful of my time.  Overall, I felt that Mr. Oshima (and by extension, Okuma Enterprises) provided excellent customer service and were very easy to work with.</text></record></dataset><record>

Brian at Okuma was professional, efficient and kind.  He made the car buying process incredibly easy even when I was constantly changing my mind.  I'll never haggle for a car off the lot again.  Okuma has a customer for life.< /review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Okuma Enterprises is the best place to buy or lease a car.  I leased a 2017 Prius Prime Plus from Larry. I was so fortunate to get this model because Toyota has a very limited supply in stock.
I knew exactly what I wanted because I researched the Toyota website by looking at the three different models that were offered.  It was helpful that the specifics as listed made my decision easy. It came down to which model was affordable.
The process of completing the paperwork was effortless and quick. I was driving my Prius in less than thirty minutes because Larry took care of all the necessary prerequisites beforehand.
This car is my third Prius.  It has improved immensely over the years in appearance, comfort, safety and gas mileage.  I am thoroughly satisfied with Okuma Enterprises and my new car.
Thank you Larry for your help!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Name>John Yao<//Name><date>1575423085154</date><Review>After our first great experience almost 2 years ago, we wanted Zina and team to help us with our second lease. The process went even smoother, faster and in a timely way with a great lease price. We wanted to get the Kia Niro EV (EX trim), a difficult trim to get, and have it done prior to the deadline for the Southern California rebate for EV's and Zina pulled it off.

This is really the only way to acquire vehicles. No need to go from dealership to dealership and the whole process of buying a car. Just test drive the car you really want, and then call Zina. She handles everything else, pulling together the best solutions and even delivering the car to your home. All you have to do is sign docs and you're done!

Thank you Zina and team for another wonderful experience!

Working with Okuma was amazing! When we were told that all we needed to do is to give them the year, make, model, trim, options and financial parameters of the car, they would find us the best package and deliver the car to our home to sign papers, we thought it was too good to be true. But it was exactly our experience and more because trying to find a high demand, low supply car, the Chevy Bolt was not easy. They located 2 packages and within a week we had the car. We did not call around, drive out to the dealership and spend hours at a dealership to lease the car. For future acquisitions of cars, we plan to work with Okuma who not only handle leases but new purchases of vehicles. Thank you very much for a wonderful experience!<//Review>< response>

Purchasing a car through Okuma Enterprises is a breeze!  Tell them what you're looking for and they have it in no time.  They are a family run business, so all of my family members have purchased cars from them.  You can't go wrong with any of the staff members at Okuma's but my go to people are Zina and Larry.</Review>

<text>I bought a new car through Larry Oshima at Okuma 15 years ago, I loved that car until I got into an accident. I tried to go to a dealership to buy a used car only to have the worst experience ever!  I called Larry and he advised me to go test drive a Toyota Prius (because I was looking for a hybrid). Now I own a very nice 2017 Toyota Prius. He even picked me up from my home so I could drive my new car home!  If I am in the market to buy a new car again I will definitely be calling Larry!< /text>< Response>

My family and I have been buying our vehicles from Zina and Okuma enterprises for over past 20 years. Zina and their staff go above and beyond to make sure their clients are satisfied. They make things so easy and convenient to purchase a vehicle. No more haggling with the pushy salesman, hours of wasted time negotiating and getting forced to purchase unnecessary accessories just to sign and leave the dealership. Thank you, Zina and the Okuma staff! You guys are awesome!< /text>

I love Okuma Enterprises because it is a family-run company based on excellent customer service and interpersonal relationships. The workers are just genuinely good people-not out to take advantage or get commission. I hate hate hate car salesmen because they are constantly trying to talk you into things you don't want and in my personal experience, I felt as if I was being talked to as if I was dumb. The people at Okuma just truly want your car buying experience to be as painless and enjoyable as possible. My family and I have been buying cars from Okuma for probably around 20+ years now. I got my first car from Zina 14 years ago and just bought a new car with her a few weeks ago. I have never met a harder working or more trustworthy woman than Zina. She responded to all of my emails and phone calls at all times of the day. Whatever I asked for, she either answered and/or got for me. She found an AMAZING deal with fancy accessories and everything. She personally delivered the car to my house as well and made sure that I knew how to work all those fancy accessories! I am so grateful to Zina and the Okuma family. I am soo in love with my new car and couldn't be happier with my purchase! My interactions with Zina did not just end there with the purchase of my new car either. She ALSO found a buyer for my old car. Not only did she make that process easy and seamless, but she found a really good price for my 14-year-old car too!! I often see the Okuma license plates driving around town and smile because I know that that person must have had the most wonderful experience buying their car too!! Thank you, Okuma!!!!< /review>

Jay and Zina helped me purchase a brand new Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport. This truck is so hot right now that most dealerships are selling them for thousands over msrp. Jay and Zina scoured their networks to find me the perfect truck; perfect color perfect model and perfect price. They delivered the Tacoma to my work and picked up my trade in all in a matter of minutes. My family has purchased cars from Okuma in the past , this is my first and definitely not my last!!

San Diego County Solar provided excellent service, excellent workmanship, and an amazing experience from start to finish on our solar project in Escondido, CA. I interviewed 8 solar companies and San Diego County Solar impressed me the most with their depth of knowledge and customer centric consultative approach. I really liked that they are local and independent and can choose to source whatever solar parts and products fit the client's unique situation. San Diego County Solar is a results oriented, solutions focused team. The install looks fantastic and the quality of the work is top notch. They also have great workmanship warranties and source products with strong guarantees. To Seth and the team, thank you for all your hard work! We couldn't be happier with our choice.<//text>

<review>Seth and the whole SDCS team was terrific.  Very professional throughout the entire process.  Seth walked me through every question and concern I had about selecting the right system design and equipment.  He was informative, educational, and friendly.  The install team did an incredible job with a very clean installation even paint matching the house for all the conduit.  I have already recommended SDCS to several friends and family members. Compared to other companies in which we got estimates from SDCS was VERY competitive and the most transparent with their pricing approach and ways to save.<//review>< rate>

We had solar installed a few years back and needed to add more. The company we had gone with before is now defunct and a friend highly recommended SD County Solar. Seth and the install team were super knowledgeable and were more concerned with us understanding how it all works rather than just selling, installing, and leaving. We had an older, broken panel and they tracked down the manufacturer to submit the claim and replaced/installed it for free. That was totally above and beyond. They take pride in their work and it shows. There are truly good people working here.</Text>

<text>We were interested in installing solar at our home and shopped around with different companies.  We were referred to SD County Solar by a friend and the introductory process with Seth was easily the best.  He was very responsive and knowledgeable.  Once we got the process going,  the installation was smooth sailing and professional.  We appreciated that SD County Solar was actively looking for methods to keep the solar panel aesthetic impact minimal (wiring, grounding, etc).  Seth continued to follow up with us after the installation and ensured we were happy and answered all our questions.  We love being a solar household now and would highly recommend SD County Solar!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Day 3 with our solar panels up and running.  San Diego County Solar was a pleasure to work with.  After closing the deal with Seth, we met his installation crew who were a delight to work with - friendly, professional, instructive.  They really seemed to enjoy their jobs.  The communication was excellent from day one.  The finished work on the side of the house was neat and polished.  After firing up the system, Seth spent some time educating me about the online app for monitoring energy production.  I feel confident that if I need help in the future with the system I will be able to reach out to San Diego County Solar for support.< /text>

My husband had a particular concern about the method most of our neighbors' homes were using for mounting the panels.  Mike did research and discussed options with him.  We settled on "portrait" method, which costs more but is less likely to cause leaks long term.  The point is: Mike will listen to you and research your questions, if needed.  Then he will discuss and help you make the best decision.  It has been several months since installation and we are very happy with SD Solar and with our savings, and feel good about doing the green thing.<//text>< gmapID>

Seth and the whole SDCS team provided exceptional service from first call to follow up. We were really glad to learn the details about the technologies offered by SDCS and the process of selecting the right size and design. Each visit from the team was on time and all of the work is top notch, very clean  process and final appearance. We also like the fact that SDCS is a local business who provide great PV systems and service to their local community. And it was such an unexpected bonus to learn that SDCS 's monitoring of the system is ongoing and uses the same app we use to check per panel output, historical output, etc. Highly recommended.</text>

Seth worked directly with us to provide installation for our 2 properties in Mira Mesa. He is the most professional and details when it comes to explain how to system works and why is it worth it for us to acquire them, beside being a really nice guy. They prepared all the paperwork and application for permission early, so only a few days after the installation date, we got our permission to operate the systems. I recommended the company to all my friends and family, and I would strongly suggest that you check them out too.</review>

I’m not one who writes reviews to praise companies for doing what they contract to do, however when the business goes above and beyond what I expected, then I’m glad to praise them. San Diego County Solar and Mike Davidson did everything right when installing my solar.  They also provided a superior design to their competitors, a lower cost, installed ahead of schedule and left the jobs it looking better than when they arrived.   Furthermore, my solar system will save me more money Than I thought as the system is producing more electricity that expected.
San Diego County Solar is the solar company you should use.< /Review>

Mike Davidson, Roy Baez and our installation crew were a pleasure to work with.  Mike's proposal was factual, friendly and not pushy. Our job spanned the initial COVID shutdown, and both Mike and Roy handled the interruption well with clear and accurate communication. The permit and turn on with SDG&E went off without a hitch. We're happy customers - I heartily recommend San Diego County Solar.<//Review>

His succinct delivery about the benefits and pitfalls of solar power as well as his forthright answers to our questions and concerns helped make our decision surprisingly easy.  The further we got into doing research on solar energy, we were very pleased that Seth took the time either by phone or personal visits to make sure we understood everything we needed to know.  His efforts to ensure we were comfortable with our decision and to make sure we understood the installation aspects of the package we chose made it a no-brainer.  Once the installation process began, he was on site to ensure his team did the job right the first time.

I’ve been running solar for about a week now and I have nothing but positive things to say about San Diego County Solar.  I dealt primarily with Seth from the company.  He came out and gave my wife and I a very thorough presentation on how solar would work for us.  He was passionate about his work and never pushed us to make a sale.  The other companies we got quotes with both kept asking about how their prices looked and when we thought we would sign up.  Seth seemed to care more about whether or not we understood how the whole project worked.  That was a huge selling point for us.

The actual workers who came out and did the installation were very professional and easy to communicate with.  They kept me informed of what they were doing and what they needed from me.  Seth was available during the entire project.  He was at the house during some of it but also very accessible if we had any questions.  And he continues to be helpful after the project helping us navigate our new SDGE bill.   5 out of 5.< /review>

<text>Mike is exactly what you wan tin a small community business owner. He took the time to sit down with us and explain his background, his motivation and his journey in the solar world. He has most likely forgotten more knowledge regarding the solar industry then I will ever even know.

He sat down with me and my energy bill and designed a system that would specifically fit my needs. He recommended a fantastic lender for the loan and I didn't lift a single finger for any of the construction, permitting or installation. It was as if one day everything just showed up and began to work.

After we put up our system 4 neighbors on our street also utilized SDCS's fabulous service. It honestly makes no sense to not at least set up a consultation with SDCS to see if any of their services can help you out..<//text><rating>5</rating></record>

Outstanding Experience with San Diego County Solar

After getting four different bids for solar installation at our home, we are so glad we chose San Diego County Solar. Seth Tilley managed the project from the initial very competitive bid through the final official approvals. He is a very clear communicator, extremely knowledgeable about solar, and always did exactly what he said he was going to do. Our 1924 one-story home in Burlingame (North Park) has a shallow parapet roof and various slopes, skylights, etc. and is historically designated. Seth thoughtfully and intelligently designed the installation of our panels for maximum production with absolutely no visibility from the street. Everyone on the crew was smart, professional, and no-nonsense. So glad we now have solar, and wish other home improvement projects could be such pleasant experiences from start to finish.</Review>

I conducted a very extensive bidding process for a new solar system in June 2019.  After several rounds I selected SDCS.  Seth worked with me to understand the various components being proposed.  SDCS was flexible in the final round providing the panels that I felt met my needs.  SDCS even worked with my roofer of choice.  The work for the project was completed ahead of time.  The installers arrived timely, worked quietly and answered my questions. Women should feel comfortable working with SDCS.  They took time to demystify the solar system and usage. Sdcs continues to monitor my system and send me reports of usage and continues to be available  to assist me in understanding the usage reports.  5 stars for them!!!< /Review>

Folks- This is how it’s supposed to go down! We met with Ken - super informative and organized - and peppered him with alllll sorta of questions - there are so many companies out there now doing this!! Ken was great- he met with us many times and followed up with info we asked for, nicest guy ever, too. We decided on re-roofing our home and installing 30 panels. Documents were very straight forward. They started ON TIME(!!) with the demo - the demo crew was polite, clean FAST and thorough! They cleaned up so well after each day of work- took 3.5 days in total (big home). Then the solar guys came and Ken was checking in often on progress. These guys know wha they are doing! Also polite folks- and careful. The job was complete in a week- and it looks amazing. Already saving on running the A/C in this San Diego heat!!! I highly recommend SD county solar!</review>

<review>When I decided to go solar, I got three estimates. I decided to go with Mike and San Diego County Solar because of a neighbor's recommend and because Mike's was a local business and felt I would get better service. He did not disappoint.  He and his crew were always at my house on time and doing what was promised. In addition to the monthly savings on my electric bill, the 30% Federal tax credit has already recouped thousands of dollars.<//review>< name>

<Review>San Diego County Solar designed and installed our residential solar array system in spring of 2019, and we could not be happier with the results. Ken Roberts was our primary interface with San Diego County Solar, and he could be reached  by phone, text, or email at any stage during the process. Additionally, he was on site for major phases of the installation to coordinate with us any details that needed to be confirmed. This level of personal accessibility and contact with a company representative (Ken) in a project of this scope is invaluable.

We found the San Diego County Solar installation crew to be courteous, respectful,  and professional. We were notified of the scheduled work days and times, and updated as well of any changes due to poor weather. During this period there was a substantial amount of rain, and the crew worked around these delaying obstacles very efficiently. During the installation process we were consulted regarding the placement and locations of outdoor electrical conduits, the  painting of reflective surfaces to match the home colors, and placement of wall mounted components, and all of the installation details fit properly with HOA requirements.

Ken and San Diego County Solar also handled all of the interactions with SDG&E; our participation was limited to logging into our account and, under Ken’s easy to follow direction, making the required selections in the online portal to switch our account to that of a solar generation customer.   Additionally, Ken and his colleagues managed the fast-tracking application for solar activation that allowed our system go online with SDG&E within one day of the City Permit being approved.

It has been six weeks since our system went on-line, and it is clear that the projections Ken made for the system production levels are accurate and honest; if anything his projections for electricity generation were lower than what we are actually experiencing.

If you are considering a solar installation, we whole heartedly recommend Ken Roberts and San Diego County Solar as the vendor of choice for such a project. We found them to be honest, fair, and conscientious about their work and their relations with their customers.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc72f6fd3f1f85:0x5f7c979def685e85<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>What a great experience from initial informational meeting, to system design, to installation and all the way thru to turning it on once SDG&E said we could turn it on. Ken Roberts held my hand throughout the process, keeping me well informed about what was happening and what was coming next. The install crew worked seamlessly with a local roofer who was needed to put the panel supports on our stone-coated steel roof (Decra Tile). The installation was clean and passed city of Poway inspection with no issues. A few days latter SDG&E gave us permission to operate. So far (only 4 days after PTO) the system is performing above expectations for this time of the year and the meter is spinning backwards as we send some excess power back to the grid each day. I can highly recommend San Diego County Solar, especially if you want a trouble free process of adding solar to your house. Looking forward of years of solar powered electricity.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Mike and San Diego County Solar were fantastic. I highly recommend them for your solar needs. The install team was excellent and we couldn't be happier with our system.

This has been the best experience I have ever had with a contractor. Mike is straight forward, honest, and friendly. His crew had our solar in ahead of time, and my system was inpected and approved within days. It is really great to watch how much energy my system creates during the day and even better knowing that I will only pay $5 per month to SDGE for a meter fee. I have already recommended Mike and his company to others, and will continue to do so from here on out. Thank you Mike and Crew for a great experience and a fantastic system.</review>

From start to finish San Diego County Solar's professionalism and organization was amazing.  They gave us the best options of how to save the most money while also making sure our panels didn't stick out like a sore thumb!  You can't even see our panels from the street.  Our home in Olivenhain will be saving thousands of dollars a year thanks to San Diego County Solar!< /Review>

<text>I have been homeowner and income property owner in California and Florida for over 30years with a wide variety of experience working with contractors and service companies. Our primary home in Encinitas has turned 30 and was in dire need of upgrades and repairs that included the help of, San Diego County Solar, along with, a general contractor to remodel our kitchen and floors, a roofing company, an air conditioning installer and a painter. Each of those companies had something I liked about them, such as; the price of the cabinets, the profesionalism of the Air Conditioning company, the quality of the roofing or the neatness of the painter.  San Diego County Solar has the best of each of those services combined into one company.
Ken Roberts along with his team's attention to detail far surpassed any of the other contractors. He was communicative, professional, was able to deliver on every detail he said he would and the company left no stone unturned. If you are considering Solar in Encinitas or anywhere else in the county do the smart thing and contact San Diego County Solar and be at ease knowing that you will be working with the most dependable, conscientious, company that I have ever worked with in my life. Sincerely, Tim Staycer</text>< pics>

Working with MIke and his team at SDCS is exactly how working with a professional should be but often isn't.  We contacted Mike Davidson after a Rotary friend recommended him to speak about adding solar on our Encinitas home.  Working with Mike was easy and painless and his team were all professional and a pleasure to be around.  Mike recommended the right number of panels and make the process simple.  When installation time arrived, his team was on time, efficient, and finished our job on schedule.  Mike walked us through the inspection and getting our SDG &E  account set up and within a month we had a reduction in our bill from our normal $350 to about $9 in the first month.  It has been one of the best investments we could have made.  I can highly recommend Mike Davidson and his team at San Diego  County Solar.<//Review>

For airport standards, W pizza is a good option. The price is on expensive side, there are not many vegetarian options. The meat is kept right next to vegetables and cross contamination is likely. If strict vegetarian/vegan, I would be concerned. I hope one day food providers will provide better standards to keep their vegan/vegetarian food prep areas separate. The order process is easy and quick. The pizza we ordered was well cooked with plenty of cheese and other topics.
There are tables with outlets.</review>

<text>Stopping by and needed some quick dinner and this was exactly what I needed.
Pros:
- the spaghetti was really good. What's better was the staff who kindly let me swap the cheese.
- lovely staff.

Cons:
- price point is high for the food but average in the area.<//text>< pics>

I ordered two turkey club sandwiches. Couldn't find the turkey. It appears the only protein on the sandwich was the egg. Very disappointing.<//Review>

If it weren’t for Covid, I would give a one star. The lady didn’t know how to process my meal voucher so I used a credit card. However she offered salsa and I accepted but there was no salsa. In fact the toast was dry too. I was smart enough to order a burnt coffee to moisten the dry toast and help it navigate to my stomach.<//review>

Worst service ever!  Staff was clueless and rude, ordered online standing in line and like others after 30 minutes we never received the order.  The staff are hood rats and shouldn’t be working with the public.  The manager blamed the poor service on covid, of course.  Avoid if you can.</Text>

To the left are water bottle refill stations but I opted to buy bottled water to be safe. Aquafina was the cheapest.
My cashier was nice so I can't complain.< /text>< user>

Wasn’t a fan of the poor attitudes exhibited by the staff. The food was average but the prices were well above the average. Thought that we could have done a lot better for our food choices.

The area was clean and the service was timely.<//Review>

Usual over priced airport terminal food. I didn't set my expectation high, but the good service surprised me. The regular coffee was good, but decaf tasted horrible. The croissant has no butter taste, looks like  assembly line product.<//Text>

<text>Airport food.  Nothing fancy despite the name.  Surprisingly good ham and cheese omelet.  I enjoyed the potatoes too.  Downside was cold, rock hard sourdough toast, and the price.  This is a $6 breakfast anywhere else, but at LAX, $15.  Add a beverage and you're just south of $20.  What can you do?< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
I'm a big fan of getting to the airport early and not rushing thru security so I can grab a drink at the airport bar. Wasn't disappointed with my choice. I loved my breakfast sandwich for how light, yet hearty it was. Kind of hard to find that combination, in my opinion. The bread was deliciously crusty (not a soft English muffin), the egg was an egg white and there was some spinach and cheese. I ate it with a glass of champagne because I had had plenty of coffee by then. I was very full and good thing because it was around 8:30am and I was waiting on a flight from LAX to Dallas-Love. Didn't eat again until 5pm that evening. I would definitely get it again. Nice alternative to airport fast food.</review>

Positives:
Grilled chicken on salad was tender and flavorful.
Overall flavor of Fuji salad.
Service - they replaced the stale almonds with ones roasted on site. Much better!

Negatives:
Stale almonds in Paleo box. Really? Aren't they grown nearby?
No option to avoid bulky plastic container, even when eating at the kitchen.
Minimal gorgonzola on Fuji salad. Pitiful little crumbles. I think they almost forgot to add it.
Price. Why do much?</Review>

Seems really pricey for what you get, could be because it's in an airport. However, my daughter seemed to like the pizza well enough. The tortilla soup was hearty and the bacon wrapped meatloaf was tasty.</text>

The food isn't bad but don't expect any service. They clearly hate their job here. A side from the inability to make eye contact, they were inconvenienced by me continuing to try and order beer that was on the menu but "out". Seemed like they didn't really want to pour a beer that would be more difficult then bud light. Who knows, but for $100 for two drinks a sandwich and soup, I expected someone who didn't hate people to be working the bar.</Text>

Delicious. Had the rigatoni with plum tomato sauce. Simple yet mouth watering. Reminded me of the pasta I had in Italy. The pizza was equally good. Had the margherita and again simple but hint of basil and the oh so perfect crust with the perfect combination of cheese. Loved it. This is food that makes you feel good to be alive. That too at an Airport!! Well done WGP.</Review>

Its airport food... ordered the spaghetti. I believe it was about $14. Was decent, for the setting. Portion was a good size, but then again I don't eat much. Opted out of the meatball version. Served fresh and hot.</text>

The bar stayed a mess from the last guest for almost half of my 45 minute stay.  I asked for water 4 times....funny, because he had no problem hearing me order the wine.  He wasn't terribly busy and seemed to attend to several others before me, even though I was there much longer.  Also....he called me "Honey" then ignored me<//Text>

The club sandwich might as well be called the "dry sandwich", dry bread, dry fillings, over-cooked egg, no sauce. And it cost 15$! Served with chips (crisps) unless you pay 2$ extra for salad! A McDonald's burger would have been tastier/cheaper. At least the bacon was crispy. Plastic takeaway box bad for environment!<//Text>

<Text>As an insider, I think no 1 should eat at the airport. Food is low quality, over priced, and the Union supported staff have a poor attitude and an undeserved sence of entitlement. A piss poor management team makes sure that the full menu is not available and the staff are lazy. Also the entire airport is infested with rats and roaches.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>The grossest meal I‘ve had in months and at $15 for a disgusting „mushroom-spinach omelet“ hopelessly overpriced.

Hardly resembled food. Not sure what went wrong here.</text>< pictures>

It was awful. The brioche bread was so dry I dropped crumbs absolutely everywhere! The roast turkey was like the processed deli meat you get at the grocery store, a few thin slices. And all this for $14.00!!! Worse experience at any Wolfgang Puck affiliated restaurant.</Text>

Extremely rude staff. I don’t understand why management hires people who come to work with bad attitudes! I spoke to an employee who mentioned his other two team members have always exhibited this negative behavior. How unfortunate. Won’t be choosing this place to eat next time I’m in LAX.< /review>

Ordered three dishes. After waiting for 15 minutes I asked them how much longer it would take and the server said very soon. Asked again 5 minutes later and they said it would take at least 10 more minutes. I had to cancel the order because my flight was leaving very soon. It’s just not acceptable to have to wait for 30 minutes at a fast food restaurant in airport where everyone is rushing.< /review>

< Review>
The pizza 🍕 is actually pretty good - though I think the tomato sauce should be a bit thicker. Service, on the other hand, was poor - after confusion over my drink order, the cashier was confrontational, although they did refund me in the end. The problem: despite having a bar (with actual glassware) in the marketplace, if you order wine at the pizzeria, it comes in a plastic cup. Good wine 🍷 shame about the fly in it.</Review>

<review>The boss must have treated the employee badly. Most of them looks like they're attending a wake. My medium done wp burger comes with "delicious" crunchy charcoal flavor. (Check out the pix) Do not eat the if you love yourself.

P/S Bartender Luis is ok though< /review>< Response>

Yuk! Had omelet over $16  and the potatoes were old and burnt, toast was chewy and omelet was bland. Also,  the tables are grossly dirty. I did not see one cleaning of any while here.</Text>

Slow Slow Slow.  Cashiers weren't the least bit concerned about how long travelers had to wait to place their order no less the prep time.  They would turn their backs on the guests to make something w/ little acknowledgment of the 11 people waiting patiently as they have zero sense of urgency.</Text>

Wait is long even though there are few orders. Expensive prices but maybe not that crazy for the airport. Food was good though.< /Review>

Got a pizza here since it was one of a few things in the terminal open around 10pm on a Saturday. It was fairly tasty, but quite expensive, so not a great value.<//Text>

<Text>I bought two salads and a drink, I unfortunately didn't check my receipts, looking at my bank statement now, I realized that I was charged 35$. I tried called them 10 times one time someone answered the call, told me to hold and dropped the line. I then tried calling back several times, and left a voice message, but no one got back to me. I called again, and the call was answered but all I here is conversations in the background and no one spoke on the phone.  I'm so disappointed.😒😡😡😡😡😡<//Text>< Pics>

I celebrated my birthday this evening in this excellent restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a cool evening and the venue was surely the reason for this fruitful celebration. The stuff  helped in a gorgeous manner, the cooking was tasty and my buddies were extremely  happy. We shall surely come back again for more joyful events. Thank you very much.< /Review>

<gmapID>0x809442e8530737cd:0x57508c870b236bd6<//gmapID><review>First time here, I can't believe it. Beef chow fun holds a special place in my heart and I judge whether a Chinese restaurant is good or not based on how well they can cook their beef chow fun. This dish usually determines whether I'll be back or not and let me tell you, their Beef Chow Fun hit the spot. It is cooked just right where the noodles aren't mushy and stuck together in clumps. It's not overly salty. They put so many ingredients into the chow fun and with plenty of meat, whereas other places tend to be mainly noodles.

They also have Hot & Spicy sauce there too. I didn't try it but for all those Hot & Spicy lovers out there, they have it.

SAME DAY UPDATE! I was curious what else they have.

What we ordered:

Singapore Rice Noodles - this is one of my mother's favorite dish and this dish reached beyond her expectations. Again, they put a lot of different ingredient so with every bite, you always had some veggies, some pork and/or shrimp. My mom really liked that the shrimp is fried and done  so nicely.

Spicy Eggplant - Omg, it's soo good with steamed rice. It's garlicky and a little spicy, perfectly balanced. Eggplant is cooked throughly but not to the point of mush.

Garlic Green Beans - I really wanted this but they said they didn't have enough for a full order so this is a half order. If you love garlic, you should definitely try this dish (and the spicy eggplant). It's cooked perfectly where there is still that crunch when you bite into it and it's seasoned perfectly.

BBQ Pork - For the small order, it's a lot. I was afraid that it would be too fatty and sweet but it is perfect for me. It annoys me when I purchase a meat dish and for it to be mainly fat, but that is not the situation here!</review>< Time>

Our usual go to Chinese spot is closed on Sunday and we were craving Chinese food and this was our first time trying Chong's.  It truly did not disappoint.  I love that they offer a variety of Asian foods.For example: You can get your Japanese/Hawaiian fix with some chicken katsu,  Thai with pad thai, or traditional chinese food where the selection is pretty extensive. I'm pretty picky with the bbq pork but they nailed it. We ordered the Chong's special friend rice and chow mein which has a little of all the protein mixed it, again, very delicious! The katsu, crispy, juicy, the way it should be. Would definitely come here again.</text>

<review>I loved the hot and sour soup! Really spicy! Two friend had beef and broccoli. One said the beef to broccoli ratio wasn't great and the other said "eh" when asked how the food was. Overall I'd go again.</review>< pictures>

Not half as good since ownership change.  Very bland, won't return.

Okay, so I tried again in 2020.  Though better, the curry has a seasoning in it that does not belong, it's the same seasoning on the BBQ Pork that was way too strong as well.  Curry chicken was under cooked and pink on the outside.  I did not realize this until 3:00 in the morning when, well, let's just say trash can and toilet were both used at exact same time.  I then went straight to the fridge to check the chicken as I ate under poor lighting while watching TV and that is when I discovered the medium-rare chicken.  Special Chow Mein was not cooked long enough (though all meats were in that dish) and looked more like a Thia dish due to the amount of oil on it.  And this is coming from a dude who says "Pork Fat Rules!"  They were busy but that is no excuse to under cook food.

I was impressed with the amount of meat served in the dishes but there is still some ironing out to do.  This was my go-to Chinese food place for years until ownership changed.  I will be returning to China Restaurant which is 4 times further than Chong's.  That should speak for itself.

Just like the previous owners, this family is VERY friendly and appreciates the business.<//Text>

I have to start off by saying it pains me to give this place two stars because the people who own and operate this establishment were exceptionally nice but the food was exceptionally awful. The food was sub-par for Chinese and the restaurant smelled of nail polish remover because of the nail salon next door.  I so badly wanted to like this place but I cannot give it more than two stars for food that is barley edible.< /Review>

Our family loves Chongs! We've be eating at this family owned & operated restaurant for about 3 decades now. Chongs was formally The Great Wall Buffet at Herndon & First. From their Kung Pow Chicken, potstickers, & special chow mein to their friend biscuits adorned with sugar for dessert; Chongs is Fresno 's best! Small dining area, great for takeout. We love Chongs delicious food!</Text>

<review>Carl's Jr is my fav fast food burger chain. Mainly because they have different qualities of burgers from their regular to Angus. And you can get all of them without any of the multitude of toppings or a bun. The waffle fries are to die for and the real ice cream milk shakes are some of the best in the business. The chicken tenders will have you going there JUST for the chicken tenders. Every location, with the exception of the Adams Ave/Royal Palm St. one, has fast, friendly and accurate service. The Magnolia Ave/Adams Ave location has exceptional service. The Bristol St/Birch St location prompted this review where we ordered an Angus beef burger with all the veggies, no condiments, waffle fries and chicken tenders. The order was prepared quickly and perfectly. And isn't that all you really want from a fast food, burger place?< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcde5474e45cab:0xe15350f3d9ba2f9c</gmap_id></record>

<review>Service at this location is absolute ridiculous and possible health violations by the pictured employee.
I had to wait nearly 10 minutes teevan place on order because the only one working the front was the manager apparently because the pictures employee was supposedly cleaning the bathrooms. He closed both bathrooms down, which is a violation in itself if the restaurant is open, and claimed that there was bleach all over both of them so none of them could be opened up until he was done  But since it had become busy he was no longer cleaning the bathrooms and was back serving me my food!?!
I simply asked for an ETA on bathroom availability and the pictured employee was extremely short and very rude so I spoke with management ... he stood behind her while I was talking to her basically mocking me and smirking the whole time, interjecting with arguements every now and again until finally I spoke up telling Mgmnt and she told him to go away.
Then, 15 minutes later he finally finished the bathrooms (there was a party there before us that had already left at this point that said they were closed when they arrived). See pictures of these "clean" bathrooms.
Foods good, no real Management complaints but if this employee is there - I'd steer clear if I were you!</review>< user_id>

<text>This is the closest drive-thru Carl's to my house so it's not like I have a lot of options every time they get one part on my order wrong.  I've noticed with this fast food chain as well as another one that they stop giving receives so you can verify what you have or dispute it when you go back in convenient isn't it.<//text>< pics>

The only negative is sometimes they don't open and fill up the French fry cardboard containers all the way full so you get cheated out of some french fries, a lot of restaurants do that to save money and cheat the customer so make sure they fill up your french fry container all the way stuffed full 😁🎄🍟</Text>< rating>

Chicken overcooked and so dry. Fries were also way too brown. Gender nuetral bathrooms were gross. Both toilet seats up and full pee. Go back to men and women...its gross to go in after a man pees all over. Doesnt flush or  put the seat down< /review>

This restaurant will charge you for the BEYOND FAMOUS STAR BURGER but will give you a regular meat FAMOUS STAR.  It's happened twice in the past week.  The employees/manager don't seem to care at all.  The staff at this location has an "I didn't take your order it wasn't my fault attitude."  This is such an important product for this restaurant's staff is totally failing.  CKE obvious can't be trusted.  Don't leave the drive through window without checking your order and get a receipt.  Don't bother try calling the number listed here; it's just a fax machine or modem. While the beyond meet burger is 7.85 plus tax and I couldn't even eat it once I got to work.  In conclusion; if you don't have time to unwrap and check your food at the drive through window; don't go to this location. Such a frustrating waist of time.   Twice in one week.  Same problem.  This locations' staff is just clueless.<//review>

this girl's Junior never seems to screw up my order which is very nice and it's cool to be able to eat at Carl's again because I've gone back to being pescatarian about a year ago and having beyond meat available God I wish they would put it on everything in their menu so I can order fries or covered in cheese and beyond meat LOL I already make quesadillas like that at home!</review>

<review>There is an outstanding employee name Brenda. She made my visit enjoyable and reliable when I need something. I go out of my way to this Carl's jr to have exceptional services. I even usually tip her. If you want Carl's jr but be treated like a human being with respect...go here and order from Brenda. I believe she's there expect Friday and Sunday. Thank you Brenda if you read this! You deserve a raise!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

My first experience using multi gender bathroom  and I'm against it! Why because men are pigs and I refuse to share with someone that treats a common area with so much distain. It made me worry about how clean the food was prepared. What's wrong with the arrangement is there isn't enough staff to accommodate the cleaning schedule.
The food was almost okay.<//Text>

<date>1458155194195<//date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>Went through the drive through and mentioned I had a coupon for a certain item. It wasn't acknowledged but I figured they would take care of it at the window. Nope. Handed the cashier the coupon first, and then he proceeded to overcharge my card. When I brought this to his attention, he motioned for me to park in the parking lot while they resolved this very unnecessary issue. I sat in the parking lot waiting and when they came out, they didn't refund my card. Instead, they handed me cash. Not even the correct amount. No inclusion of tax or anything. A quick apology and nothing else. Now after all this my food is cold. Great customer service Carl's. Your mistake costs me my lunch. And, to make it worse, I overpaid for this sorry excuse of "customer service". Appreciate it.<//Review>< Pictures>

This place is literally across the street from my house and every time I've gone there, the service sucked! Today, after work, I decided to stop by at Carl's Jr...was greeted by another drop dead crap customer service, could barely hear her and she sounded like she didnt even cared about a paying customer. Just like previous experience with a girl with glasses and blue hair, but now a different person...AND it's a manager, go figure. She charged my card, closed the window and walked away without saying anything. Then another person brought me my food out and with a happy attitude asked me if I wanted anything else before saying goodbye...I get home look in the bag and my fries are up side down and barely even a medium...there were no cars in the drive thru and their service was barely up to par. Get your shyt together Carl Jr.! Replace the staff or close down and get out of town so a better place can replace it!!!< /text>

Horrible Customer Service. Always Dirty. Food is cold and taste dry. Sucks cause its only 24 hour around here. I rather go to Del Taco next door and buy thier hot fresh tasty bacon cheese burger.

Im so disappointed in Carls Jr. yuck.<//review>

The manager Joe Golla was a total worm. I heard him yelling at an employee for not spitting on an order. He uses the same mop for the floor to clean the grills and tables. Never going there again!<//Text>

A great local dealership. We just bought a used Chrysler Pacifica here. The whole team at McConnell was super helpful and acted trustworthy during the week or so I was deciding. Marshall knew a ton about the car, and he was transparent with all his answers to my questions. It was such a refreshing contrast to other experiences I have had.

They were also accommodating and quick to respond with some of the little things that needed cleaning and fixing a few days later.

My parents-in-law bought a Volt from the same dealership a few years ago and had a good experience too.<//text>

<text>I purchased my ‘21 ram at this dealership and the Process was good and that would be a compliment, buying a car isn’t usually pleasant.
My first Time using the service department has me a little worried.  I had the truck in to fix a problem with rambox, One side has a 4 mm gap the other side was a 7 mm gap and when it was cold it was hard to close. That said they changed out the insert and when I picked it up the gap looks worse, when I got home and measured it it’s now 9.5 mm wide you can stick your finger in it. They shouldn’t turn a truck, worse then they got it.
The second issue, gas mileage, I’m getting 13/14 mpg on a truck that should be getting between 19 and 24. They said everything checked fine and it will get better as engine breaks in. From what I’ve checked engine break-ins will bring you 0 to 2 mph better, and breaking is 500 miles, there’s obviously something wrong with my engine. I’m waiting for a call back with more detail… I will update this.
The service manager called the factory and it sounds like they gave the pat excuse, if everything checks out, no error codes, it must be my driving style. Not sure how putting cruise control on on a flat freeway is affected by my driving style. Getting a third less gas mileage than expected is a major issue, $100 a month in extra cost and it’s a lot of carbon dumping in the air when it shouldn’t be.
This is probably not an issue with the dealership, but the manufacture.  I will get back and update, when I see how the dealership deals with their corporate in favor of me the customers.

Update 4/28/21
Rambox was adjusted again, now it is acceptable, just not 100%. It closes with a good slam, when the weather is warmer, when it is cold, you have to slam it extremely hard.

The gas mileage issue, RAM has done nothing except tell me the codes say there isn’t a problem, but I just got my lowest mileage at 13/mpg, while Concentrating on keeping the “Econ” light lit.

I had purchased a service plan for oil change... they don’t tell you you have to wait 1 or 2 hours. I knew there was a problem when the guy asked me if I was going to wait.  Wait for an oil change? Duh. Think twice before you get the agreement, especially if your time is valuable.

My overview of RAM at this point is, they pay a lot for advertising and getting awards and play tricks and games to avoid dealing with known poor quality issues. Coming from owning Hondas for the last 12 years, it’s a culture shock.  This is what almost killed the American auto industry in the 1980s.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1620247354800, 'text': 'Hello Mike,\n\nThank you for bringing your experience to our attention.

<text>McConnell Dodge is AMAZING! Marty, Ken, and Anthony are the best.

It took Ken 15min to find a pinched wire in my truck! A 2 year mystery that 4 experienced mechanics couldn’t find.

I was about to give up on the truck completely, and gave it one last shot. I'm thankful I found you guys!< /text>< date>

<Text>Traded in my 2014 Chevy Cruze for a 2020 Jeep Gladiator. Everyone was very professional and straight to the point. Every time I had a question they had an answer right there and then and know what they are talking about. I went shopping around Vacaville and they were priced 5-10k higher than what I paid here. If you're looking for a new car give them a shot, they're more than willing to work with you and deserve a shot if they have what you're looking for.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I wanted to trade in my convertible mustang for something I can ride my new grandchild when it arrives. I wanted to buy local so I went to the closest dealership which happened to be McConnells. I walked into their sales office and told them I wanted to trade in my car, I was introduced to Miles who I had fun checking out cars with. I’m thinking of the ease of getting my grandchild in and out so I opted for a Chevy Equinox.  Everyone I met that day was pleasant and knowledgeable. Today, 5 days after my purchase I received a hand written thank you and welcome to the family card. So nice...and they loved my chihuahua Rosie who was treated like a queen. Thank you McConnell for your awesome staff and customer service.</text>< pictures>

It has to be replaced by a new tire. Avoid this dealership if you need to get tire fixed or replaced. I asked for a free replacement and they declined. I have autism and it is tough to talk to people. So if you have autism avoid this place.<//review><user>105160314707738762300<//user><Gmap_id>0x808410c6ddc9990d:0x4f2cdb75b4d70bad< /Gmap_id>< Response>

62 & been buying off lots for 40 yrs.  This was by far the best experience ever. Ruben was very knowledgeable. He answered all my questions & paired me with the perfect Ram 2500. Then Luis worked hard to set up a deal I couldn't walk away from. No pressure, felt comfortable, and ended up with more than I thought I'd get for my trade in. So glad I drove the hour and a half to go there.<//Review>

Stopped in today to discuss issues with my jeep.  Bought it there 3 years ago from a great salesman named Bill.  Had it in my mind I would get issues fixed and trade it in.  The two young men at the front desk acted like I was bothering them, while I was trying to ask questions, you lost a sale and I won't be back.<//Review>

My husband and I were interested in purchasing a minivan for our growing family, so we did some research online and found that McConnell's had 4 in stock that we were interested in. We instantly noticed that their prices were significantly lower than prices listed from dealers in our part of the Bay Area, so we decided to take the family on a nice drive to Healdsburg, CA to check them out. When we first arrived, the salesman Marshall Brant showed us where the minivans were located and invited us to check them out and was not pushy at all. He was knowledgeable about the vehicles, very friendly, unpretentious, and made us feel at ease even when my two little kids were going nuts playing in the minivans. We were given a great deal and I drove home in my 2012 Chrysler Town & Country a happy woman.< /Text>

<review>I explained when I called that I am an internet shopper and am ready to make a purchase and wanted a price.  Several dealerships I called would not give me a price over the phone.  Charley gave me an immediate bottom dollar price no hassle no questions.  His price was the best by a significant margin.  Went to the dealership, worked with Peter who did a great job showing us the cars and going over pluses and minuses, no psychology, no "can you just see yourself in this one", just friendly "let's go for a ride and here is how everything works".

You always wonder if the bottom price really is the bottom price and I tested it by asking how much additional they could take off if I bought two?  Peter took it in stride and said they had given the best price - the question created no problems and he said, "You two stay out here by the car or come in if you wish, I will just leave you alone and you can decide and just let me know when you are ready."  True to his word he went back inside and let us kick it around.  No pressure, no sales tactics, no lock you in a room, - great experience.  While we were going over the colors etc after we had made our decision to buy, but before we signed any paperwork, Peter even had the finance person Mike who has a Volt come and talk to us.  He gave us the positives and the negatives - no pressure.

Mike was the nicest non-pressure finance guy I have ever bought a car from - usually that position is the power closer push you into more person.  Mike finished off what was already a great experience with real world advice, walking us through the paperwork and when I requested extended warranty and paint protection, he discounted it down without my asking to a level that I have had to fight to get in the past.  He even went over the pluses and minuses, even though I walked into his office asking to buy it, to make sure we were making an informed decision and he made sure to give us our cancellation process if we decided we did not want the extended warranty next week or next year.

Best car buying experience I have ever had.  I bought my first car for school decades ago and it cost me $25 - I have fought hard for every purchase since for it to be the best deal I could get.  Bought two new fully optioned Chevy Volts - no hassle, no pressure, no problem - loved it.</review><Response>None<//Response>< user_name>

Everything so far I have tried has been amazing there is always a line but it's worth the wait. The service is lacking big time especially if you go the last hour open. The products are so good I look pass the service and still give 5 stars.< /Text>

<review>Ice cream is delicious and I think their prices are fair. Especially because every time I get an item with fruit it is always fresh. The employees are okay. I never had a good or bad experience with them. The only downside is that they only accept cash and their parking lot is really small. Although this place is worth checking out on a hot day. Must try the diablito or mangonada!< /review>< pictures>

The choices are too many and too delicious! Don't take my word for it...go for yourself and you'll see that 5 stars isn't enough to rate this place. Love the ice cream options and the juice options. So much more I can't even list here.< /review>

Every time I come here, there would always be a long line but I didn't have to wait that long. Seems like they have a lot of staff to help every single customer. The girl who helped me was friendly. Although she didn't speak a lot of English but she was trying her best to communicate with me. I give her credit for effort!

The food was good especially the mangonada! I also enjoyed their fresa congelada!! Yum!!<//text>< Pictures>

Try the mangonadas, they are delicious!  This is a great place for Mexican style fruits and ice cream treats. We went early Saturday  afternoon and it was pretty packed with people, plus there was a steady stream of people coming and going. The staff is very nice and there are quite a few of them to take your order. The only drawback is that it's cash only, we didn't know that going in and there was no sign posted.< /Review>

This place sets the standard for regular and exotic Mexican ice cream flavors this side of border, with their hand-crafted creations. Prices are reasonable as well.< /Review>

The service here is amazing and the mangonada is even better.  We may not have gotten a great photo, but it's the best I've had in the East Bay.  Don't be afraid to go in even if you don't peak Spanish. Everyone is super nice!  We didn't chose to, but they even offered to let us try the different aguas frescas before we picked one.  Just be warned: it's cash only, so be sure to have enough on hand.  Modest sizes are modestly priced.  Grande sizes have rather grand prices.  The mangonada pictured came in at $12 after tax.<//review>

Thoroughly enjoyed what I got, mangonada and bionico. Service can be somewhat slow and also not everyone speaks English there but as long as you know what you're ordering you're good.< /Review>

Good Mexican snacks, you can find almost anything from Mexican ice cream, to corn and tamales. Cash only and pretty pricey, bring a good amount of cash. Long lines on hot days and very small parking.<//review>

This place makes a really good mangonada. Very good paleteria. It was very busy when we went, but that's a really good indicator that this place is really good.

They have a really extensive range of ice cream flavors and have a good menu of snacks. I got the elote on a stick, and a large mangonada but would want to try other stuff too like tostilocos and other loaded chips.

The only downside, which isn't the store's fault, is.... the parking sucks. We had to park a couple of blocks down to get to the shop. BUT, that shouldn't stop you from getting good Mexican treats and ice cream from this place!< /review>

I just left this place and I already want to go back!! The people are so friendly and in such a great mood! And the owner is just a sweetheart. I had the Maple Bar ice cream and Burnt Caramel with a church bowl and it was one of the best things! I will definitely be going back here</Review>

Lots of options for traditional Mexican ice cream and snacks. Ordering is unorganized and can take a long time. And the line to pay is also unorganized. Expect to wait a while because the lines are usually long, it is good ice cream after all.< /review>

This is such an amzing place to go and hang out!!! Their ice cream is so good, many flavors and natural fruits. They also sell other mexican traditional sweets and spicy treats. Like tostilocos, raspados, nieve, and so much more. Definately 10 out of 10. I really recomend it! 🙌😀👌</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It reminded me a lot of my beloved Mexico, everything is delicious, the only thing I thought was that the prices are high but in itself everything is worth it. Very rich and the people who serve very friendly.

(Translated by Google) Things are good, but sometimes if they take a long time to prepare them, and the worst of all is the lady who charges, a lady of medium height, with a big nose and shoulder-length hair and thin, she has a very bad attitude. despota seems that you were going to give things when you are the one that is going to consume your business, is not friendly, and that the truth takes away the desire to buy anyone, recommendation q move it from the box or talk to she even if she is the owner of the place, a smile, a good morning or good afternoon and a thank you will not take time to attend with courtesy and kindness for the client to return, to keep the business.

(Original)
Las cosas están buenas, pero en ocasiones  si tardan mucho para prepararlas, y lo más malo de todo es la señora q cobra, una señora de estatura mediana, de nariz grande y pelo como al hombro y delgada,  tiene muy mala actitud te atiende muy despota parece q te fuera a regalar las cosas cuando uno es el q está llendo a consumir a su negocio, no es nada amable, y eso la verdad le quita las ganas de comprar a cualquiera, recomendación q la muevan de la caja o hablen con ella incluso si es la dueña del lugar, una sonrisa, un buenos días o buenas tardes y un Gracias no le van a quitar tiempo ai q atender con cortesía y amabilidad para q el cliente regrese , para mantener  el negocio.<//Text>

1. The chicharrones prepared very well served and with good presentation.
However, we ordered 3 and the 3 tasted expired (that is, old) we could feel on our palate the taste of the expired oil in the pork rind, and that incidentally was very thin and breaks easily when biting.
I think it can be improved with better quality pork rinds, it is difficult to imagine that a traveling business serves better quality pork rinds (I have been able to verify it) the price would not be an impediment for most of the people and would be more in line with the invetity of this deal.
2. We also asked for 3 ears of corn, but under the preparation, mayonnaise, cheese and chili there were still the corn hairs, which when biting into it was quite unpleasant as they got tangled between our teeth and you had to remove them from your mouth; It seems that no care is really taken to stir them as much as possible before preparing them. I can understand the fact that you need to serve the customer quickly, but just as speed is important, so quality and the final presentation of the product are necessary to ensure that customers return.
We tried the water of mamey oh ... excellent as few.
Parking will be a factor depending on the time you visit the place, in the afternoons it seems to be more complicated.

(Original)
En líneas generales un buen lugar para snacks" Sugiero al dueño poner atención en dos detalles que observamos en nuestra reciente visita con la familia.
1. Los chicharrones preparados muy bien servidos y con buena presentación.
Sin embargo pedimos 3 y los 3 sabían a expirados (o sea, viejos) podíamos sentir en nuestro paladar el sabor del aceite caduco en el chicharrón, y que dicho sea de paso era muy delgado y se rompe con facilidad al morder.
Creo que se puede mejorar con chicharrones de mejor calidad, es difícil imaginar que un negocio ambulante sirva chicharrones de mejor calidad (lo he podido comprobar) el precio no sería un impedimento para la majoria de las personas e iría mas acorde con la invetidura de este negocio.
2. También pedimos 3 elotes, pero debajo del preparado, mayonesa, queso y chile aún estaban los cabellitos del elote que al morderlo era bastante desagradable ya que se nos quedaban enredados entre los dientes y  tenías que sacartélos de la boca; parece que no se tiene realmente cuidado de removerlos lo más que se pueda antes de prepararlos. Puedo entender el hecho de que se necesita servir al cliente con rapidez, pero así como la rapidez es importante, también la calidad y la presentación final del producto son necesarios para garantizar que los clientes regresen.
Probamos el agua de mamey oh..excelente como pocas.
El estacionamiento será un factor depende la hora que visites el lugar, por las tardes parece ser más complicado.</Text><user_name>ruben belmont<//user_name></record>

La neveria is my favorite place in the world! I'm a regular customer because ice cream is my favorite food always i always greeted w / smiles, they have an incredible crew. I've only seen them be rude when a customer disrespected them. As for their hours, they do close at 10 but sometimes during slow season (winter) they may close an hour or so earlier due to low sales. The lines can get especially long after church which is down the block but if you go when its raining or around 8-9ish on weekdays or may get lucky like me and have the store to yourself. Other than that, its great! There's always new flavors to try I been going there since they opened and I am still not done with all their menu 🙄. Ultimately, I strongly recommend La Neveria to anyone and everyone you will not be disappointed!

Neveria is my favorite place in the world because I love snow! The employees always greet me with a smile, they are very friendly. The only time I have seen them rude is when customers lack respect. Although he says they start at 10 o'clock, sometimes during the winter they start as an hour before because of few clients. The linens get long especially after mass but if they go when it is raining or at night during the week like 8-9, they may find the place basic. Other than that The neveria is perfect! There are quite a few flavors to choose from. I have been going since they opened and I have not finished trying all their menu. Finally, I recommend everyone to go to the neveria. They will not rebuke!

La neveria es mi lugar favorito del mundo porque me encanta la nieve! Los empleados siempre me saludan con a sonria, son muy amables. La unica vez que los e visto groseros es cuando los clientes les faltan el respecto. Aunque dice que ceran a las 10, a veces durante el invierno ceran como una hora antes causa de pocos clientes. Las linas se ponen largas especialmente despues de misa pero si van cuando esta lloviendo o en las noches durante la semana como a las 8-9, es posible que encuentren el lugar basío. Aparte de eso ¡La neveria es perfecta! Hay bastantes sabores de que elejir. Tengo llendo desde que abieron y todavia no he acabado de probar todo su menu. Al fin, yo les recomendo a todos que vallan a la neveria. ¡No se van a reprentir!<//Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service, it is not known where to order and the old man who works there and does not ask who is next no longer approaches people and asks them what they want without knowing that there are clients who already had enough time waiting.
