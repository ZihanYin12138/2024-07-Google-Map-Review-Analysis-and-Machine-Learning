< Review>
Highly recommend!!! Super clean office, front office staff was awesome, was greeted as soon as I walked in. I had my cleaning done with Digna and I must say she did a fantastic job!! Dr. Shah went over my treatment and explained everything so thoroughly to the point where I had no questions and I’m the one who asks a million questions. I am looking forward to getting my treatment done.</Review>

Just had my routine cleaning.  The poor technicians with all the extra PPE...but it is what must be done.

I love that they use the ultrasonic descalers instead of the traditional metal picks to clean your teeth.  It is so much FASTER and more comfortable.  The staff is always friendly.  The techs always explain what they are doing.  They show you any areas of concern on the xrays, etc.

Thanks for a pleasant experience.</Text>

Dr. Ghasemi is highly skilled. She cares for her patients during and after procedures. She actively listens to your concerns and wants to make sure you’ve been given the treatment exactly as you expected.
The staff are really nice as well!< /review>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.
They do more fillings than it needs.
They are just trying to milk out every cent from you.
They would stop in the middle of a filling process and told you that you needed a crown instead of a filling. (Please say no firmly, my teeth turned out fine with just some fillings. )
They would strongly advice to do a root canal on your healthy teeth.
They would share story with you about how they couldn't get into a medical school to become a doctor so that they became a dentist instead. How reassuring is that?
I couldn't even find information about the dentist who treated me on their own website.</review>

I went into the office today for the first time. As always walking into a place for the first time I get nervous. Surprisingly that was not the case today, with the issues that I had getting the adequate information from my previous dental office was a problem. I was afraid to never be seen and if I was not with the best service. Well I was very wrong about both. I was treated with the most utter respect and care. Everyone in this office was extraordinary nice. This has been one of the best dental offices I have ever been to.</Text>

< Review>
One of the BEST dentist staffs I have encountered. The environment is fun and energetic. Alma and Blanca are some of the memorable impressionable staff that stand out. Dr. Rutner is a great dentist as well. He pulled all four of my huge wisdom teeth 6 years ago. He just did some drilling for my porcelain fillings a couple weeks ago. The dentist is usually something that folks don't look forward to, however if you have to do it, your best bet is Grant Road Dental. The people will make you feel better about it and you're more than likely to be greeted with a smile and leave with one.<//Review>

Grant Road Dental is awesome!  It's a bit of a drive for me, but once you find a dental office you love going to, it's worth driving the extra miles!   I've had to have a couple of crowns and onlays done - the fact that they can create them right there in the office and place them on the same day is HUGE when you don't have a lot of free time available to go back and forth.  My hygienist, Melissa, is super sweet & gentle, but also does a great job!  Totally recommend them!<//text>

I've been here a number of times for cleanings and fillings and the staff have always been wonderful, polite, and professional. Melissa and Dr. Askari are attentive and efficient in their dental work and have always taken care to answer my questions -- even the ones I didn't know I should be asking! The front desk staff are friendly and do their best to work with your schedule. I'll be going in for a wisdom tooth extraction soon at their sister office, which is right around the corner: I didn't have to deal with double the paperwork and billings because they were able to pass along my information and scans from previous appointments.

These guys really care about their patients, and every visit has been an absolute pleasure. I definitely recommend them!< /Review>

This is easy, I've been with Grant Road Dental since 1996! The very first year I asked if Dr. Rutner if  he'd be retiring any time soon? His answer then was "No, I have 4 kids to get through college!" Since then,  I've moved to the Peninsula in 2002, but I still trek-it down for all my dental needs. I've had root canals, teeth pop-off, multiple crowns and the very latest ordeal for me...an implant. All which have been handled with the very best care and the best payment plan. I'm not going anywhere else! Last I checked....his the fourth kid graduated college, and lucky for me he's still practicing! ( I didn't know how young he was back in the day!)
This practice is the BEST!< /Text>

It had been almost two years since my last dental visit and I was feeling a little nervous about going to the dentist again because I was expecting to need some work done. I appreciate that Brittany was very gentle during my cleaning which helped me feel more comfortable. Dr. Askari was patient with me during my dental work and I didn't even feel her injections. Overall, great experience.<//review>

<review>Tonight I had my first appointment here. I dislike going to the dentist and have, unfortunately, been neglecting my dental health. All the staff, including the front desk, hygienist, and dentist, were extremely kind and welcoming. I feared being lectured or put down because of the length of time since my last cleaning, but not once did I feel that way in their office. Instead they were sympathetic but very encouraging to start a new healthy dental cleaning routine. I will gladly go back and will quickly recommend Grant Road Dental to all friends and family.<//review>< Time>

<review>Finding a good dentist is always a grueling tasks but since moving to the South Bay on a recommendation from a dental assistant at my previous dentist for the past 8 years I checked them out. They were great, personally Alma who helped confirm my appointment and that my dental insurance was covered to Evelyn at the front  desk, to Blanca who took my X-Rays and assisted with my cleaning to Dr. Rutner himself who checked out my teeth and will be extracting my wisdom teeth in a couple of months. They were all friendly, professional and a jovial group. This is definitely my new dental home and I highly recommend them.</review>< rate>

<Text>I have been going to this office for about 4 yrs now. Every time I go into the office  I'm always greeted with a smile, hence a dental office. It helps take the ease off having to go to the office. (I really used to hate going to the dentist). Dr. Rutner has helped me smile again with work on my teeth. I was recently in to see Shiva for a cleaning. I've seen others as well.  they were all great. I will be back and would recommend. Thanks for the great service always.< /Text><Time>1431919599069</Time>< Name>

My family and I have been going to Grant Road dental for more than a decade now.  With such a wonderful and professional A-team running both front - Alma,Ronda and other A+ ladies/gents - and back-end (Drs. R and A, amazing DH and DA folks), their  personalized approach to dental treatment/services is tops on my list and worth spreading.  Check them out for your future dental needs. =)<//Review>

<review>The team always get me in without any long waits when I arrive for my appointments. I always see Melissa. She gives very thorough cleanings and is super gentle. I never feel rushed when I am in the chair - She makes sure to take her time to get everything squeaky clean. Some dental offices always tend to be very rough, with a very unpleasant experience, but it's never lie that here! Even my 10 year old son doesn't dread going to see the dentist when we go here.< /review>< pictures>

I had a deep cleaning to reduce gum bleeding two months ago.  Digna did a great job: the whole procedure was done with such a care that my discomfort was at minimum.  Ever since the deep cleaning, I have not had any gum bleeding.  Thank you Grant Road Dental!<//text>

<text>I have been a patient of Dr. Askari's for several years. She's not only knowledgable, but she's also very gentle, nice, and caring. She makes sure that she fully explains any issues or procedures and that you know what your options are. She also truly cares about your comfort and on several different instances has made sure that I get the right type of anesthetic to relieve even minor discomfort. The staff is also friendly and professional and will work with you so that you understand your insurance coverage.< /text>< Pics>

I have been coming here with my son for a few years. Dr Rutner recently used the Laser they have for fillings on my son and it was amazing. He is pretty nervous at the dentist office and the laser with no injections really helped him! Thank you so much Dr Rutner and his assistant, Blanca, for putting up with him!!
Melissa also does his cleaning and she is the only one he will let touch him. Thank you!<//text>

I have nothing but good things to say about this dental office. Cleanings here are very thorough and pain-free. This office has definitely changed my idea of going to the dentist. From Dr. Rutner  & Dr. Askari to the hygienists to the front desk, everyone here is amazing and they all go out of their way to make sure you leave with a smile :) Thank you Grant Road Dental!</Text>

I came in with my mom for her second opinion…I gotta’ say, I’m very impressed. I’ve had bad experiences but once you walk in, you are greeted right away and  not ignored by anyone. I can’t believe that this office has so much gadgets! Dr. Rutner was very  detailed on explaining things without us feeling lost. Also, I want to thank Merie for helping me because I had so many questions and concerns for my mom’s financials and was patient enough to answer them.<//text>

<Text>I have been a patient of Grant Road Dental for the past year. This is one of the nicest offices I have been to so far. The front desk staff is always so friendly and welcoming. They have such flexible hours that works well with my busy schedule. Merie has been very helpful in explaining my benefits to me. Sometimes it is so confusing dealing with insurances and it helps to have someone at the office who understands how it all works. I had a few procedures done and the dentist, Dr. Askari, was very gentle. She really knew how to make me feel as comfortable as possible. She knows what she's doing.</Text>< pics>

<UserId.>116093882119945803587< /UserId.><review>I saw their reviews on another website, so I stopped by the office to schedule a teeth cleaning appointment with them. It was my first visit.

They gave me the first available appointment, which was a week and a half away.

A few days before my appointment, I received a message from someone named Alma, stating that another appointment opened up earlier and requested that I called in.  I was out of town, so I couldn't.

Two days before my scheduled appointment, I received another call from Alma, stating that I am "required" to call back to confirm my appointment time.  Again -- I was out of town!

I received ANOTHER call from Alma again, the next day, stating that I am "required" to call back before noon, or they would cancel my appointment!  Her second call woke me up, so I called her back immediately.

She said this is "standard procedure".  People MUST call back, or they will cancel.  What on earth?!  I confirmed my appointment at the time I made it.  Why must I confirm it again ... and again ... and again ...?

I should have known something was up when the dentist chewed out his dental assistant because he changed the satellite radio. He did it right in front of me! Turns out it was Dr. Bakdach. Who does this in front of a customer?!  Obviously someone with poor business ethic.

Obviously they didn't want my business.  Either their employee/hygienist wanted they day off, or they just don't appreciate my business.  Economic times are tough, but apparently not for them.  I have never been so offended by a supposedly professional doctor/dental office.  I'll go elsewhere!!!<//review>< rating>

Arye did the scans for my Invisalign refinements and was super patient with me. She always takes time to deal with my sensitive teeth and gives me as many breaks as I need.

< review>
On the plus side, their facilities seem high end and they really do a good job with communicating in a digital age: email reminders, online appointments, etc.  I also think that their staff honestly does an excellent job with the procedures.

Ultimately I left Rutner after a couple years and decided to give them a 1-star rating because of their sales approach.  I'm not a medical expert and I want to feel that if my doctor/dentist/etc recommends a procedure the recommendation is in my best interest.  I don't want to be second guessing the motivations of my health professionals at every decision.

I went to Rutners after having neglected regular 6 month cleanings for some time.  I went in as a new patient and 1 cavity was found as well as 2 pre-cavities.  All 3 were recommended for drilling/filling which I did.  I'm unsure if the pre-cavities were real now.  It was recommended that I return every 3 months and then 4 months for awhile, but this continued for over a year.  My insurance covers only 6 month cleanings.  While perhaps I needed a little extra attention at first, this stopped making sense quickly.  At some point, they started recommending veneers due to the fact that my front teeth have a rough surface and collect plaque extra quickly.  I explicitly told them that I didn't care for cosmetic work, only medical issues, which they assured me this was.  They told me it could wait, but on repeated visits kept recommending it.  Eventually I bit and asked for more details.  Insurance wouldn't cover it, and it would cost thousands of dollars.  Further research indicated that this procedure is pretty much cosmetic only which is why insurance won't cover it.  Maybe the advice was good, maybe it wasn't, but I realized that I didn't trust them so I found a new dentist.<//review>

I've been seeing Digna for cleanings and Dr. Rutner for many years.  I like how I can get my crowns done the same day so I don't have to walk around with a temporary crown, they communicate with me through text and the staff is just all around friendly.</Text>

Recently I went in to Grant Road Dental for a routine check up with my hygienist Shiva, and I honestly have to say was quite impressed with the service I received. Shiva was very polite and gentle, the staff all together is very welcoming and I love how they are always willing to work with my busy schedule.< /review>

I have had a great experience with Grant Road Dental and especially Dr. Askari during my Invisalign treatment.  All the girls there are super nice, and especially Merie!  Looking forward to having all of my treatments done by the Grant Road Dental team.< /Review>

<Text>Oh my gosh I was in a panic today I chipped the front of my tooth. Not good especially when I have a meeting coming up on Monday. I roll the dice picked a dentist and it was Grant Road Dental. I was contacted by May with the most warm welcoming and genuine concern voice over the phone. Customer service is huge! Specially when it comes to Dentistry! She got me connected with. Dr.Cammelia Sharhram Askari with assistance from her lovely assistant Nancy. I was in and out less than an hour! DR.ASKARI IS THE MOST WARM FRIENDLY FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND A MIRACLE WORKER!!! I knew I found my new dentist! Thank you for fixing and making me feel confindanr and beautiful!💞😀soooo happy and very pleased!🌸😀<//Text><Rating>4<//Rating><user>107960216918150002310<//user>< pictures>

I came to Grant Road Dental for Invisalign  based on recommendations from a few friends and I could not be happier with this office.

I worked with Angelica to manage the cost of my treatment. It was clear that this was not just a job to her as she took the time to work with me on what payment plan would work and was sure to inform me of all the resources and benefits their office offered such as low interest loans, payment plans available, and warranty information for the service. She was funny and relatable throughout the process. I also really enjoyed working with their front staff employee Evelyn. She is always upbeat and happy to see patients and explain how payments work. She also welcomes chit chat that is never done haphazardly. She really enjoys it. These two make a solid team but combine them with their dental staff and you've found yourself the Teeth Dream Team.

My treatment is nearing its end and it really amazes me that each time I come in I leave being grateful for the quality of service provided. The first thing that stood out to me was the comradery among the staff because this transfers over to patient interaction. This makes it a friendly and comfortable environment for patients. The next thing I noticed was that the staff treats you like an adult. Even though they know you  may have very minimal knowledge of dentristy, they never make you feel lowly for asking questions and whats more, they always explain to me what the procedure will be, what they are looking for, what are some good and bad signs, and how I can address it. In short, they share their knowledge with you in a patient oriented manner that allows for patient empowerment and accommodation. They make me feel like their equal and nothing less.From the front staff to technicians to their dentist. None of the offices I went to for the past 22 years have ever done that. Dr. Rutner also happens to be an Aggie Alum like me which is awesome!

The office itself if the most modern I have ever been to and I am not one to dislike aesthetically pleasing offices. They play relevant music and some employees can be caught dancing *cough evelyn cough.* I've also been welcomed to looking at and exploring teeth models found in some of the rooms. That really pleases my inner child who was scolded if I even looked towards the direction of any cool things in my childhood dentists office. I find it very fun!

Their location is also really good. They are next to a grocery store, a gym, a gas station, lots of food places, and the holy grail of appointment waiting store; Marshalls. I have a love/hate relationship with this because I always find something which is a problem for my wallet. Good thing the office is next door to remind me that the purchases I could make here should go towards my teeth instead! Haha. Parking is never an issue either.

Overall, I am really happy I became a patient here and would highly recommend it to those looking for orthodontics or a regular dentist.</text>

Well, I've been a patient at Grant Road Dental for about 3 years now; ever since I moved into the area and asked around about a Dentist and was recommended to visit GRD...I went in for some basic treatment and some cleaning and really had a good experience with both aspects of my visits.

I recently broke a tooth and needed, but didn't "want", to visit the dentist because I "assumed" the worst.....thinking that I'd be told to have the tooth pulled.   Reluctantly and fearing the worst, I called GRD and I was told not to worry, come on in, and we'll take a look at it.  Well, shortly after I arrived, I was told that I would be OK, and the Doctor felt that she could "save my tooth", it was a Molar, and I was pretty attached to it so that was good news indeed!

The front office verified my insurance coverage and took care of the "business" with the insurance company while the Dr and her assistant got started right away, repairing, not pulling, my tooth.  Dr. Askari and Haley were very friendly and very attentive during the treatment.  They talked to me along the way, explaining what to expect and what the process was and asked, often, if I was "ok" during the procedure.

After the first part of my treatment was complete, the front office team, specifically Merie, worked with me to help set up my next appt and go through the billing process so that I wouldn't have any "issues" come up to delay my treatment.

I have to say that the entire process was very smooth and although I can't say that I "enjoyed my time in the dental chair OR had FUN undergoing my "root canal"; I can say that I appreciated the effort of the entire Grant Road Dental team to make the experience as positive as it could have been.

I got my tooth repaired, and not pulled; I didn't have to stress out over "haggling" with my insurance company; I didn't have to "stretch" the treatment out over days or weeks, and most of all, I actually had a few laughs along the way due to the awesome GRD team.

Important to mention here is that I was scheduled to "fly out of state", on business, the following day after having this work done and while I was away, Merie, in her sheer "awesomeness", called me to make sure that I was OK and to make certain that I wasn't experiencing any problems with my tooth.  Wow! That's customer service.

Thanks Ladies!  I appreciated the attention and really enjoyed the laughs.....

See you all soon....I believe my next "cleaning" is just around the corner...

<time>1378499522404< /time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Dr. Rutner has been my dentist for over ten years and he has been wonderful.

From general cleanings and exams, adult Invisalign treatment, to the replacement of numerous 15 + year old crowns, I have been extremely pleased with the results.

His staff is very professional and friendly as well, with many of them having worked there for over 10 years.

On my most recent visit, Dr Rutner was able to get me in very quickly to replace a veneer on my front tooth that I had damaged. He was able to make a perfect replacement right in his office and installed it immediately.

It looks great, so many thanks Dr. Rutner.</Review>< pics>

My friend did some cosmetic dentistry at Grant Road Dental and the result was amazing.  Inspired by her results,  I went to see Dr Rutner for a consultation.  He suggested veneers, Invisalign, and one extraction.  Dr Rutner and his assistant, Blanca, explained in detail all of the procedures.

My upper veneers were finished late last year and I have had so many compliments!  I am in sales, and  having a fresh and perfect smile is a confidence booster.

Dr Rutner painlessly extracted one tooth, and now I am in Invisalign to straighten the lower teeth.  I am already seeing results.

Thank you Grant Road Dental for everything!</Text>

The office staff is not good at all. They fixed and confirmed me an appointment at 7 AM Wednesday and I made myself available for this appointment, but their office is not even open. Later they responded to my voice mail and e-mail, asking me to reschedule without even asking any apologies and courtesy. They have to improve on their office process and staff's behaviour with their value patients.< /review>

<Review>the quick recovery is incredible.  The chiropractor Mr. Chetra Keo is truly professional, very interested in his work and in my well-being.  I arrived with a pain of three weeks ago and in a few minutes he healed my pain.  I recommend it 100%.  When I went to bed it was intense pain and it disappeared with the Chetra Keo technique. Regarding the receptionist, she was very attentive and gave me very good information. Thank you for her dedication.</Review>< pictures>

Worst chiropractor experience EVER. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful but the dr was rude and condescending, spoke over me and my friend who was having her first ever adjustment, and laid his entire body across mine to do my hips. No dude, that's not necessary. That's borderline sexual harassment. Avoid this place. Go to a REAL chiropractor< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I saw Dr. Thomas at the Pico Rivera office after visiting my local Lakewood office; the drive is well worth it.

Dr. Thomas listened empathetically to my concern points & how they came to be & in doing so he was able to offer some ergonomic solutions for my posture while studying long hours. He was kind, gentle & even supported his moves with acknowledgement of my weary body soon after the opposition adjustment by staying close & offered physical support at my front so I didn't fall off the table; my previous doctor left me to gather myself.

Aside from the basic adjustments done by my previous doctor, Dr. Thomas took his time in also applying some pressure points to my right shoulder which is where I was concerned most. He had a great sense of humor while maintaining a professionalism that made me confident in his knowledge & confidence of his practice.

I will be returning to see Dr. Thomas in Pico Rivera.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1599159571066, 'text': 'Mounique - thanks for taking the time to provide feedback on your last visit to The Joint Chiropractic in Pico Rivera.

Friendly environment and helped me with my overall health. Was getting a lot of headaches and chest pains for almost a month and with one visit there I could already feel the difference. Little by little I wasn’t getting anymore headaches or chest pains. Would highly recommend it even if it’s to just try it out you won’t regret it.< /text>

<review>The Joint in Pico Rivera is very clean check in was fast and easy. I originally started at the Monterey park office but followed Dr. Thomas to the Pico Rivera office he is AMAZING!!! I never feel rushed he always takes his time and answers my questions. Best part is he always remembers what was hurting me the previous visits and will ask how I’m doing. Dr Thomas makes sure it’s gotten better and gives me tips on how to maintain my pain if any at home. Since I’ve dealt with a shoulder injury for a couple of years it’s finally gotten better. Overall it’s been a great experience and I will continue going back.</review>< username>

< Review>
My daughter and I loved her food. She seem very humble and down to earth. The young lady at the counter was very nice and on it too. We had the fish dinner with macaroni and cheese, baked beans, greens (which were on point), and hush puppies. My oldest went last month and bought me one of her shower curtains, hand drawn due to her fiance dropping my dinner off the car roof so that shower curtain made up for the lost dinner. We will definitely eat there again. ☺</Review>

Today was our 1st visit and it will not be our last! We drove 45 mins on the recommendation of a friend and she was right! The food is outstanding! I chose the catfish meal and it was so crisp and delicious! And you won't go wrong with any of their sides. I'm not embarrassed to say that we finished the whole thing in the car before driving off. Really the best way to enjoy it is fresh and hot!<//review>

A no-frills soul food based spot. We tried their chicken and waffles and found the dough in the waffles to have a nice chewy doughnut like texture. Friendly and attentive staff. A bit of a small sitting area, but they accommodated some overcrowding by implementing a foldable outdoor table and chairs. I’ll have to try their breakfast burrito the next time I’m in the area.</review>

BB is amazing. The food is always so good. My husband found this family owned restaurant and we havent stopped going since. Every time we go we are treated like family. My fav is the breakfast burrito but i also love the Mac n cheese n baked beans as my sides. I get the sweet tea and a refill before i go. The burrito was so good I was half way when I remembered to take a picture today.<//Text>

My girlfriend and I ordered the Bacon&Waffle, Chicken&Waffle, Mac&Cheese, with a Red Kool Aid and let me tell you something, I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! We received our food in a timely manner, it was fresh, delicious, and had ZERO complaints. All of their food is priced fairly, tastes more than great, and this all comes along with excellent customer service. Anyone with a right mind would have no choice but to come here and enjoy something from Ms.BB’s delicious menu!</Review>< user_id>

Very cool little spot, nice staff.  Meant for take out but has 3 tables seating 4 each . I got the chicken n waffle cook gave me an extra chicken wing it was my first time there. The waffle was good enough but did ask for crispy but not so much so but compared to others delicious.

Chicken is the star of this dish!!! Well seasoned!!!!< /review>

I had driven past this spot dozens of times since they opened a couple years back, but kept forgetting to stop in. Man, I didn't know what I was missing. You can literally smell the chicken and waffles walking up to the place. So good! I've been here a few times now. The waffles are good (it's true, they're more on the soft side) and they go perfect with the crispiness of this chicken. The ribs are also very good. And totally out of left field...their breakfast burritos are amazing. Thick, savory, and filling. The service is good. Never had to wait more than 15 minutes for anything I ordered. It's a small location, but I'm telling you, what they do with it is fantastic.<//text>

I love this place. Came here once and was blown away. Home cooked feel, delicious eats, southern hospitality.  Everything cooked and/or fried to perfection. Great portions and value! Talk about a hidden gem. More like a hidden diamond.<//text>

This is easily the best soul food in the area. Their fried chicken is divine and it's so much better than anything you can get anywhere else. Their Mac and cheese is equally as amazing. I really can't overstate how much I love their food here.

Michelle is really sweet. They're super attentive and they're lovely to chat with.<//review>

SO GOOD! Hubby and I were craving waffles so we stopped in and LOVED IT. Quaint little storefront, friendly and helpful staff. The chicken and waffles was out of control good. Don't forget to try the hot sauce with the chicken!. Will definitely be coming back.< /Text>

The owner is a very friendly and warm; so is the staff. The food is good; the seating area is small, but we were able to easily find an open table. I would definitely return, as I love to support small business owners.</Review>

Great food, affordable, and wonderful service. When we went in I think we had typical expectations of a small local place - it would be rocking food, but it might be slow or begrudging service. We were wrong!! The food was awesome, yes. But the service was also great. Thank you!<//Review>

There's absolutely nothing good here as far as food quality. Customer service is fine but the people in the kitchen just flat out cannot cook.

Ordered a lemonade and it was way too sour. Had to add alot of sugar to make it palatable. Waffles were bad. Texture is weird and too soft to where it absorbs the syrup and yet is still dry so you end up having to add more syrup to compensate. Flavor profile also off. My eggs were completely overcooked. Chicken was bland and a bit overcooked. Mac n cheese also bland. NOTHING I consumed here tasted good.<//text>

Best chicken and waffles ever.  Saturday breakfast with hubby.  We both had chicken and waffles.  Price point perfect.  Two hefty plates of waffles and chicken with coffee $25 with tip.  Chicken perfectly cooked.  No breading, just a light dredge and super crispy skin and succulent chicken inside.  Waffle was delicious and super flavorful.  Served with real butter too.  Everything came hot fresh from fryer and waffle iron.  Met BB and she is a delight.  Staff pleasant.  Service prompt.  Do yourself a favor and come here.  Only three tables, but I bet the lunch/dinner takout if fabulous.  We'll do that next time.  Love that the menu is limited and they do what they do right.</Text>

Food super delicious especially the man n cheese.  Ribs nice and tender melted of the bone. Only thing too small inside for seating.
Will be back for a tray of Mac n Cheese.

Tasty food for not that much money! Nothing really disappoints except for maybe the limited seating. Staff is present, attentive and friendly! I always try to make it an effort to stop by when I'm in the area!

Pros:
Great food
Low price
Super friendly staff

Cons:
Low capacity Seating<//Text>

I ordered the hot link combo which included 2 sides,I chose , the baked beans with Cole slaw. I enjoyed my meal , hot link was definitely HOT 🔥 just how I like it, baked beans were good, as for the Cole slaw it was a little dry for my taste , Mayo and apple cider vinegar was all it took. I will be going back soon.😁</text>

<Time>1518883933912</Time><Rating>2< /Rating><review>This place has 3 tables and hardly any space to stand otherwise. We ordered chicken and then waited for about 30 minutes before we got served. This is when we noticed they had served us ribs. When we told the young lady we had ordered chicken, she did not apologize or offer to redo our order. Rather, she said chicken is not served with the veggies we had ordered.

Rather than argue and wait another 30 minutes, we decided to eat the ribs. They were fatty with hardly any bbq sauce on them.

Not a good experience.

Do not recommend.</review>< Pictures>

Get here early, this place is a cafe that focuses on Breakfast and Lunch. They close when the food runs out. Saturday stopped by about 3:40pm and the doors were locked. Sunday stopped by and they were closed with a note that they were sold out. Made a third attempt about 1pm and the food was amazing. Reminded me of southern soul comfort food.< /review>

Amazing breakfast food, their waffles are to die for. My only complaint is that they are extremely busy and you have to wait an exaggerated time to be seated and receive the food.<//Review>

Oh my stars!!!!! This place is out of this world!! Didn't think we'd have luck finding a good chicken & waffles place in this side of town, especially after a few strikes, BUT WE DID!! Actually a GREAT place!! The waffles are fluffy & tasteful; the chicken has a deliciousness all it's own; let me tell you about the koolaid.....its been a while since I had some good koolaid & this is the bomb . com!!
The cherry on top is Michelle & her mom. They are such great hostess'! Feels like I am at my Auntie's home, not a place of business .... made me tear up! Such beautiful souls, so friendly.
I didn't see a parking lot for them but found street parking fast. Not sure during peak times.< /Text>

<Text>My wife and I have driven passed this place for months and have finally decided to stop by and try it. All I can think of now is, why did we wait so long to try it?! Food was delicious, loved the chicken and waffles, chicken was juicy and full of flavor. Waffles were awesome, not super doughy at all, they were fluffy and soft. Don't forget about that red Kool-Aid with the chicken and waffles, totally hit the spot! Got to meet the owners daughter, Michelle who was super friendly and warm hands down one of the best "hole in the wall" restaurants I've ever been too! Great food and great service.

< review>
(Translated by Google) Enjoy the best chicken and waffles! A restaurant where you can eat local American soul food.
It's not a meal like a restaurant or hamburger chain for tourists, but a place where locals come and go. The shoppers are very helpful and friendly.
I ordered the most popular chicken and waffle. Simple things like fried chicken and waffles. Chicken spices were very delicious and I felt nostalgic. Waffles are served with maple sauce. Add a spicy sauce to the chicken.
The combination of a little spicy chicken and a sweet waffle is endless.
The inside of the shop was not big, but it had beautiful and nice jazz.

(Original)
最高に美味しいチキンとワッフルが楽しめます！地元のアメリカ人のソウルフードが食べられるお店です。
観光客向けのレストランやハンバーガーチェーン店のような食事ではなく、地元の人が通い詰めるお店で、お店の人はとても親切でフレンドリーです。
私が注文したのは1番人気のチキン&ワッフルです。フライドチキンとワッフルというシンプルなもの。チキンのスパイスがとても美味しく、懐かしさすら感じました。ワッフルはメイプルソースをかけて頂きます。チキンには追加で辛味のソースを。
ちょい辛のチキンと甘いワッフルのコンビニージョンは無限に食べられます。
店内は大きくはありませんが、綺麗でいい感じのジャズがかかっていました。< /review>

This place is a solid five. They added Paella to the menu. The Paella was good but a little dry and the seafood a little overcooked.  The salsa, fish tacos and the  rest of the menu is real solid.  Very clean and very nice owner and staff.< /Text>

<Review>to start off, I really enjoy this place. We especially love taco Tuesdays. However, tonight my wife placed a phone order at 6:10 PM. She was told the order would be ready within 10 minutes. I arrived at 6:25. I watched four other parties who walked in after me and ordered from the counter get their food and leave before the manager checked on me. While I appreciate his attention, I did not get my order until 6:45. This is the reason for 2 stars. The quality of food deserves five stars as usual. Hoping things get better.<//Review></record>

Love this place but lately, when I place an order for pick up, it's never ready on time. I call up to 20 minutes in advance and I am always told that it will be ready in 15 min. The last 2 times, I've had to wait at least 10 minutes for my order. I can I'm advance because I'm tired after work and I just wanna grab my meal and go. I don't always mind the wait but I would like to know I'm advance, that I will be waiting a while regardless of how early I place an order.
But the food is amazing and you cannot beat taco Tuesday. I will never stop coming here lol</review>

I had the fried catfish. The batter was very crunchy which I like a lot. I do not like mushy batters. I also had grilled zucchini and fries with it. I enjoyed my whole meal. Found it filling hot fresh and acceptable price for what I got. Full plate, full stomach. Nice clean environment nice staff. They also have food on display at the counter so you can see what you're ordering. I will revisit again.< /review>

After two years, I finally got around to coming to Howlin Rays. Thankfully, I went at an hour when the line wasn't terribly long, so I was able to get my food in 1 hour. What I noticed about this place is that though it is a long line, and jam packed inside the restaurant, everyone is in such a great mood and the staff is hospitable and helpful. No one is cranky, nervous, or panicked because of the workload.<//Text>

Best taco Tuesday if you're looking for fish tacos. Can't beat $1 per battered or grilled fish taco. They also serve alcohol and have a great selection on condiments for your food.</review>

< Review>
I can still taste the flavors of their tostadas and like Pavlov's dogs I salivate at the thought. The gnoochi is my fav but so was the steak and the duck and the other dishes I tired. Working through the menu apparently. It's the kinda place I want to stay open so feel obligated to spread the news but it's also the kinda place I want all to myself. I even took my mom and she's a tough one to please lemme tell you. What else can I say....it's all good!< /Review>

Good place for reasonably priced fish plates.  Tacos on Tuesday are $1. Not the best but definitely good for the price.  I come for the fish plates.  It gets crowded at lunch on Tuesdays.< /text>

<review>My boyfriend and I went in yesterday to get some fish tacos for taco Tuesday and let me tell you ! My boyfriend said they were the best tacos so he needed to take me to try them. We ordered probably 5 minutes before getting there through the phone. We got there and paid, the whole thing was quick quick. Under 5 minutes later after we paid our food came out and we were ready to go. Delicious $1 fish tacos on Tuesday! Either grilled or battered ! DELICIOUS! I ate only 3 and I was full along with my boyfriend who can eat more than I can. Good sized tacos.
Definitely recommend!<//review>< pics>

I was looking for a nice place to get some fish. It really looks nice on the outside on the corner of Willow & Cherry. I just had the basic fish & 2 side items. The fish was ok a nicely battered and flakey 🐟. I got fried Zucchini, and rice. The rice was undercooked. Total cost was about $11. You bus your own table. So really it is like fast food fish.< /review>

Delicious fish prepared to order. Service is friendly and relatively quick. The owner and staff remember customers and makes it feel like a friendly place. I love their salmon in lemon butter sauce with grilled zucchini. There are many types of fish and side dishes to choose from. There are also daily specials. We like to come here frequently.< /Text>

I dig this place the service was not fast food but its not sit down dinner slow either. How batter fish tacos and they were large. Place is clean with lots of seating. Will come again.
There are some TVs playing local Chanel's and nearby businesses advertising which i thought was cool.<//text>

For healthier fast food options, this place is a better choice for the area. Ordered the salmon and two sides + drink, and the salmon was quite good! Not fond of the raisins in the cole slaw though. People are eating less carbs / sugar these days. Raisins spoil a good Cole slaw if you ask me.</review>

<Text>Food was pretty good. Not sure if they normally supply dipping sauces for fried fish/shrimp or shrimp cocktail, but our meals didn’t come with any. The customer service was poor, both the front desk and the manager. Didn’t want to help resolve the issue.

I ended up resolving the issue through postmates.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Good high quality healthy food of course by the name you can guess they focus on Seafood but reasonable price. plenty of parking and friendly staff. I have been here several times and every time was a good experience. Also it's a very casual atmosphere a couple of TVs with usually Sports on. It's in the same parking lot as Home Depot so I usually go have lunch here after I'm done at Home Depot.<//Text>< pictures>

This was my first visit with my daughter and grandson.  First of all I am a little biased because the manager had a LA Chargers jersey (Woot Woot). The dining area was very clean and presentable. As for the food it was very good. The simple fish and chips was very good and my daughters shrimp and scallops kabob was amazing. What was unique was their tartar sauce which is made fresh daily. It was different but actually enjoyed it better than the traditional one. This will not be my last visit when craving fish and chips. Especially for the excellent staff, the atmosphere,  and food.< /Text>

<Name>Erick Rivera</Name><Time>1585674709988< /Time><rating>5<//rating><review>Looking for a healthy seafood place to eat? You have got to try this place out. They have amazing food and yes, they sell other stuff beside seafood. They also sell chicken and clam chowder soup.I love the fact they have phone orders because the wait time could be lengthy at times
In regards to the pricing: THey can be a bit pricey ($10-$13) but it is to be epected because it is fresh seafood and that is always expensive anywhere you go. However,they do have $1 fish tacos on Tuesdays and these can be fried or battered ascan be the chicken. THe chicken tacos are not $1 though. THe staff is always friendly. No complaints whatsoever there and they keep the place real clean all the time. THey helpacommodate large parties as best they can and try to speed up the process of receiving orders. . I will definitely return. GOcheck them out and then follow our travel vlogs on instagram @thehungrynomadz<//review>< pictures>

<text>This is a good fish place. Fried fish is crispy, grilled is done right, and prices are OK. The slaw is sweet with both raisins and pineapple, which I don't like. Stand up ordering and waiting takes a long time. Pay attention while waiting, because they overlook and mix up orders more than they should.< /text>< Pics>

I like every thing I've ordered there! With that being said you must try the "Cippino". It is only served on the weekend & until sold out that specific day. (That is my only problem) They don't serve it every. It is a tomato based soup/stew filled with Shrimp, Fish, Crab, Oysters, seasons, onions, celery, etc. AMAZING Flavor. My first time trying it! Try it if you go on the weekend.< /text>

Ok...this is weird:
Earlier today, I was at a convenience store and bought a couple soft drinks for the Vietnam Veteran in the red trainers.
Then I come here for dinner and the manager, Salim, comped my supper when my debit card failed.

The broiled catfish was amazing.
Definitely get the slaw.
The service...
A++++++++++++++++

I always enjoy the grilled fish tacos.  I like that it's cooked fresh ,so don't mind waiting.  Atmosphere is clean, pleasant  and staff friendly.  Great meal for modest privce.  Great location in Signal Hill.  Not to mention the view from the hill at nights is spectacular !</Review>

<Review>Friendly people. Taco Tuesdays are best here since they still have $1.00 taco unlike everyone else in town that's raising the prices.
They have a salmon dish that's really good as well. It's kinda cool that one of the owners us a fitness enthusiast makes you feel like she would watch to serve you healthy food, plus she's behind the counter working as hard if not harder than everyone else.<//Review><user>107200271540430938845</user>< Rate>

Amidst all the fast food places that can easily give you a heart attack in this area, Fish-o-licious is a welcomed breathe of fresh air and fresh seafood.  Food is made to order (except fried options).  Fish is fresh and prices are great.  Will keep coming back.< /Review>

Very nasty cold food I ordered $40 in food and the cashier Leslie took the order wrong I corrected her then my food still came out wrong & cold they didn't clean the shrimps all the way so there was still veins left in the shrimp then they had to cook the zuchinni again because they served it very cold. I will not be returning.< /Text>

FISH TACOS: you get  a nice size piece of fish. Cooked to perfection. Very fresh products.

ASADA TACOS: one of the best meats I have tried can definitely compete against king taco asada meat. Products are fresh. Meat portions are nice.

GRILLED SALMON: I always ask 3 minutes on each side. Its fully cooked. Excellent taste. Not a fishy taste.

OVERALL FOOD IS GREAT AND HEALTHY.<//text>

I was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews, but I am completely satified I love sourdough so the bread was perfect fish was good, nice size pieces. Only thing that was a little weird were the shrimp not bad but weird I love fried shrimp, but not sure if I’ll be trying those again. Side salad was large and everything was fresh!!!!
I also ordered a brownie which on the menu says brownies for almost $3 but it’s one.... haven't ate it yet but I hope it’s really good for that price.....
Thanks fishalicious I enjoyed the meal.<//text>

Scallops were horrible, they must have changed their supplier because I had eaten there before and it was good. Staff was nice and accommodating - fixed me a "fresh" batch - still hard (looked better - but weren't).<//Text>

It's not bad.  I wish they had better selection of sides, like actual whole brown rice instead of what I believe is probably Uncle Bens boxed rice, but the fish is good.</text>

I just went there and got to go and got a fish plate I asked her what it is and they told me it's fish and chips so I said it's fried fish..tell me why it comes with the skin they cut the fish down the middle and grill the one side so the other side still had like fresh scaly Skin and on top of that I got rice instead of coleslaw and they didn't change it and the sourdough bread that comes with it is gross I honestly never leave reviews but it was just too much I had to leave one The fries were cold an stale I don't know how this place has such good reviews. And for the Price it is definitely not worth it.<//Text>

<text>I had the shrimp which was tough and flavorless on top of vegetables that were over salted and left a bad taste in my mouth. The rolls were dry,hard, and horrid. The salmon that my partner had was flavorless that they put on top of the fries making them completely soggy and I'm sure they game me the wrong soup because it didn't taste anything like clam chowder I had ever tasted and defiantly didn't have a single clam in it. I really hate having to write this because they did have amazing customer service but I hate it even more that I paid over 30 bucks for food I couldn't take more than one bite out of because it was so bad.<//text>< pictures>

<review>This place is terrible over all I give it a quarter of star or lower if I could. My sister's food was really crispy near Bert as if somebody had left the food cooking for too long. My son said his chicken tenders were flavorless and the sauce was not good. My fajitas didn't even taste like fajitas. They were flavorless, and when I requested salsa to spice it up, I was told that there was none and all they had was tapatio packets.I  asked for money back the girl just rounded up 5 cents. I went back to ask for the rest of my money and she declined and said "Oh it's just a dollar". The tables and floor were very sticky and the stains on the table were like melting metal and casting it onto the table. Overall, I recommend this place to nobody. This place is beyond overrated. Had this been the very last option for food in the whole world, I'd starve. From there I took my business to a real eatery, CA Fish Grill. The person that referred me here, I recommend that they dont refer anyone else to this establishment. I posted a review on Yelp and the owner was very rude and nasty because they didn't like me review. The way I see it, this business will not last too much longer</review>< Name>

Ok so it's Tuesday! EVERYBODY knows what that means. TACO'S!!! I wanted to try a different spot this week so I stop at Fish-O-licious on Signal Hill. The staff was polight and ordering went well. I grab mine to go. I get home to find out ordering didn't go as smooth as I had hope. I ordered some grilled fish and some fried with grilled zucchini on the side. I open up my food to find ALL fried fish taco. #ImUpset so I decide to make the best of it and dig in... It's COLD it's HARD and unenjoyable . Not Crunchy folks... HARD!! Now instead of eating TACOS and kicking my feet up I am here writing this review.. BAD EXPERIENCE for me😑<//review>

<Review>I didn't really know what to expect. I'm not a big seafood fan. I went on a Friday and they had clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. It was really good, I'm a big guy and I couldn't finish the whole thing. Not as good as what I've had at Fishermans wharf in SF, but still good. The clam pieces are small, but there's a good amount. My wife ordered the Basa fillet,  cajun style. It was a really mild and delicious fish. The cajun seasoning did not have a whole lot of flavor to it, but it was really good for someone who does not normally eat fish. I would be happy to return anytime. The place is clean and moderately busy. The wait staff are super nice. We also ordered brownies for dessert. Nothing special about those, I wouldn't get them again. All in all, a really enjoyable dinner.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Got the three tacos and 2 sides deal with rice and coleslaw. The fish was fresh, but the whole meal was bland. Nothing special. The best part of the meal was the coleslaw, rice was overcooked.</Review>

My husband and I go to FISH-O-LICIOUS very often, and our usual purchase is that of the fish tacos. Their food is very delicious, and we highly recommend this restaurant, also customer service is awesome!</Review>

They really came through for me! They tested both of the batteries in my car, and found that one was pulling power from the other. They called and found what location had the battery that I needed and sent me there. It was already waiting at the second location when I got there. I went back to the original auto zone in Covina on citrus avenue and they were kind enough to install the battery too for free! It was easy and quick! I really appreciated their kindness and professionalism. I highly recommend this location!< /review>

Don't hire someone just to hire someone. That person at register (she) so unhelpful it's crazy.
Unable to spell butyl, unable to find it in the system, or in the store, talks about duct tape, double sided tape and at end: we might have carried it at one time but not anymore... No comment</review>

Ordered a part for my car.. they told they were going to get it the next day at 10:30am.  Called at 11am the next day and they said that it would be ready at 1pm.  Called at 2pm anx they told me they didn't get it until the next day.  Not a good store to get anything.   If you want to order a part go to O'Reilly Auto parts.  They have the parts the next day.</review>

This store is just okay. They had the part I needed because I checked ahead of time but when I walked in, nobody was standing at the front. Then they served people out of order, people were frustrated. It has no flow to the store. I will be using someone else.<//Text>

Was working on one of the cars late. Stopped by here to pickup a sensor I needed. It was right before closing and I could tell they did not want to help out. I checked online for the part first and it said in stock at this location. The employee pulled it up and said no we do not have any. Not sure if that was really accurate or if he just did not want to go and find it then ring me up.

Either way it was not a great experience.< /Text>

Dont use your atm card because you will be overcharged. I washed for 5 min and my card got charged 10.00 .  Now, i have to deal with that. Time and money waste.< /review>

Several vacuums don’t work, some of which still take your money with no result. The vacuum I got to work had low suction. The car wash has a poster of wash modes that doesn’t match the machine so you don’t know if you’re getting the right mode. Pre soak just sputters our small amounts of soap so it takes tons of time just to get your car soapy. Not pleased, will not return.< /review>

<text>I have gone here multiply times and quickly learned that if i want to actually wash my car id be better off paying for the cheap wash at really any normal car wash place. I do have to say though i use this place for the vacuums and that seems to work out well for me personaly</text>< Time>

<Review>It has a atm swiper if you dont have cash so that was cool but when i tried to get one of those towel it ate my coin..luckly one of the workers was around to open the machine. Would have given you a 5 star but I have to belive that if noone was around I would have ben S.O.L!</Review>< user>

First time here, as i just moved into new house  close by.  Got there 7:45am on a Saturday and no people washing their cars. That should have been my first warning. I used the first stall closest to Winchester Rd.  Water hose was running without machine even on. Couldn't get foam brush to work while it was on for 2 minutes on that setting. Hard to get off dirt without scratches if there is no soap coming out. Had to improvise and squirt a pile of wax onto ground I could dip brush into. Then no Tru Color finish. Air dryer didn't work either. And I forgot to mention the floor drain smelled like it was full of dead fish. $11.75 to half wash my own car. Left a note under door for management.  I'll update review if I hear back. Going back to my old self serve car wash in south Temecula. Redhawk, behind Staterbrothers. $6 and it works< /text>

used my card for my car wash ended up being $11 instead of the $5 dlls posted, plus vacuum so i ended up spending about 13 dlls + my time, not worth it at all, can get profesionally done for 14 down the street.</review>

I checked every stall and some sort of water was being wasted. Who makes a $3.50 minimum? The brush did nothing to clean my windshield. There spot free left sports everywhere. And their vacuum picked up nothing (I got the inside of my car cleaned out by had better then that vacuum)< /review>

Service was outstanding!!!!
I’m a new customer who had all my questions and concerns answered.  Staff (Karen first then Luis)  went above and beyond!!! 👍☺️  Luis stayed ‘till the store closed to make sure my connection and transfer of service went through.  This was the BEST service ever! I highly recommend using AT&T and coming in to their corporate store!</Review>

<Text>The guys at the store displayed great service. I was helped within a few seconds of entering the store, then helped find an old receipt from a product I purchased a few months ago. Very sanitary and seemed to care about how I was genuinely doing. Encouraged me to stay safe and enjoy my week! It was great!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I went in for an upgrade on my phone, left with my New S20 Ultra! Super excited!!! Rep Gerardo was very informative, helpful & patient with explaining everything to me and assisted me with all I wanted. My phone was in stock & I didn't have to wait at all. The location is new, not too many people are aware - I recommend this location. Glad I stopped in, very satisfied with customer service! I felt valued as a customer & even Manager Robert provided me with some water while I waited.<//Review>

Had a terrible experience with another location. Louis & Dani were so helpful. I had issues with a brand new phone purchased at another location. Louis went above and beyond to ensure I got my phone set up and activated. I was in and out within 20-30 mins. Will defiantly be back when I make future purchases. He turned a bad experience into excellent. I recommend this location. The store manager was wonderful as well. Nothing but high remarks for this store! All professional and friendly. Glad I was able to get my issues resolved with them.</Review>

I went in today to upgrade my iPhone XS Max to an 11 pro max and the staff couldn’t have been nicer and more helpful! Both of the guys that helped me today were named Daniel and were super chill guys. Is definitely recommend hitting this store up if you are looking to upgrade and save on your bill every month! They definitely hooked it up</review>

As soon as I walked in Gerardo Bolanos greeted me with an energetic vibe. He was professional, helpful, patient and friendly throughout the entire time I was there for my upgrade. He took his time to help me understand how my bill was broken down and even saved me a few dollars by making a slight change to my account. Nothing but a positive a review for Gerardo. Definitely would recommend anyone to pay him a visit.<//Text>

The store open right on time, was clean and with friendly staff. I was assisted by Karen Cisneros, Karen was cordial, friendly and very knowledgeable.  Karen made my visit to the store very pleasant and I felt that I got answers to all my questions, she took her time explaining to me most of the features of the new phone I got. I am not use to writing a review but I think Karen and the store deserves it, I was trying to upgrade my phone online just to avoid going to the store, and due to delivery issues I wasn’t able to do it. I am glad on chosen to set up my appointment on this specific store because I got the helped I needed.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1595970212562, 'text': 'Hello Luvia Rodriguez, Serving our customers with the best service possible is something we strive for every day.

<Name>Melissa Acero< /Name><time>1581906896849< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>So incredibly happy with my experience here. Gerardo was so wonderful and helped me with exactly what I went in for. The entire staff working tonight were so incredibly kind and helpful. I was in and out with my brand new phone in hand. Thank you for answering all of my questions and explaining everything so thoroughly and patiently as well as making the experience so stress free, which is more than I could say about my previous experience at a store nearby.

Originally I started at the Redlands location, but had such a disappointing experience with one of their team members, Vanity. My goodness, get ready for the upsell and the most uncomfortable experience of your life. At one point I became so uncomfortable I thanked her for her time and attempted to leave and she told me, "good luck then, I'll definitely see you later to fix everything the other store will mess up for you, you'll be back." I had to politely smile and walk out. She even went as far as trying to get me to add an additional line I'd have zero use for that I didn't even need and saying "why not just do it for the free phone and just keep it somewhere." Huh? I was so confused and my fiance was just ready to leave and the persistence was overwhelming. I completely understand trying to make a sale, but my goodness, whoever trained this poor girl needs a lesson in boundaries. No means no honey. Worst part, that was in 15 minutes of being there.

Steer clear everyone ;)< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Friendly, helpful, and honest. Young man pulled a screw out of my tire and confirmed that it was shorter than the tire tread, so no need to repair! 👍< /review>

Horrible customer service! There were 3 workers, and I was the only customer, it took just tires 1 hr to do an oil change . They waited 20 minutes just to pull my car into the stall. The Manager at La Canada flintridge is rude, and Nobody had a mask on!</Text>

I was told to wait 2 hours for a simple nail on tire. Next day available appointment was after 1:00 pm. So busy.... There were only 1 worker and 1 manager who had very clean hand. I guess only person actually does the work. no wonder why they are busy. Its very big store well equiped. just none to do the work and manager was not really that kind.<//text>

Good service, got all 4 tires replaced efficiently and back on the road.  Tires looked great and the car drove like it was new again.  Good pricing to boot.</Review>

< review>
Came in for a tire change, which they managed just fine. However, then they tell me the battery id dead and past the point of recharging. I'm not mechanically inclined so I just tell them to replace it then. I assumed changing a battery would be one of the simplest things a mechanic could do but they royally screwed it up. The positive terminal was not screwed on tightly, I could move it by hand. There was about a 1/2 of empty space between the battery and the cable. Also, they obviously did not have a battery in stock that was the correct size so in stead of telling me this, they just wedged a huge bolt under the battery so it would be high enough to (barely) connect to the cables. If that had come loose it could have destroyed my engine. When I went back to tell them about this, I was told of course that there was no manager there but to leave my name and number and one would get back to me right away. Never heard from anyone. DO NOT GO HERE. INEPT. UNPROFESSIONAL.</review>

Appointment made at 9:00am.
Walk in.
Rep: Sorry, my guy isn’t here until 11:30am.
Me: Then what about the appointment?
Rep: The appointment is made through the website. They don’t know what is happening locally.

The rep at the desk has an attitude that makes it seem like I’m asking ridiculous questions for a timely appointment. What a horrible place.</Text>

Just took my car in because I needed them to check my tires because It felt like I had a flat, guy tells me they are all fine and it must be the road. Made it sound like this was all in my head. Fast forward less than a minute, I get on the freeway and my tire blows.</Text>

<Review>Live close by and see this place is always open and busy. Bought a set of tires and had them installed. Good price and service. There was a rebate on the tires I bought and the service rep completed all of the forms for me and even gave me an envelope without asking. I only had to add a stand and put in the mail. Recently had a bolt stuck in my tire and the fixed the tire, oil change, and rotated the tires all quickly. I use the website and book appointments.<//Review>< Name>

I call this place after coming back from six Flags,  unfortunately I had a flat tire,  I was 3 blocks away this place and I check the if they were open they said they will be open till 8pm.
So I removed the tire and install the spare. I drove to the tired place and I asked the attendance to check my tire and fix it. He tried to sell me a tire,  first he asked if I runned with the tire when it was flat I said no...  Then before he even unmounted the tires said that the tire might not be good because the damaged was too Big,  I checked and then we'll see.  Then he said it will be $50.00 to repair flat tire . Well I needed the tire fix so I said yes.
Then when the tire was unmounted he said, they can't fix it because the tire was too damaged,  so new I needed anew tire.  Which he said it was $250.00 .
I drove back to SD and took it to discount tires,  and magic no e
Issues, the tire was fix atno cost, well yes. I am a costumer at discount tire.  But this people at just tire are dishonest.</text>

I called 25 minutes before closing on a Sunday to get a plug in a tire on the car. They said to come in. I got there in 15 minutes and they got right to it. Jacked up the car, took off the wheel, plugged it, and I was back on the road by 5:20.</Review>

Fair price but they charge you $7.00 for two tires valve caps where they could just use the one from your old tires. You can save some bucks just a few minutes drive down in Tujunga area with cheaper, honest and good service.< /text>

<Text>Took my wife's car to get a tire a few months ago, on the way home I heard a strange noise coming from the new tire and pulled over. NONE OF THE LUGS WERE TORQUED!! I grabbed the lug wrench from the trunk and tightened them up and made my way home.

Last week I replaced the rest of the tires and this time only ONE of the rims were torqued, the one I tightened myself the last time! The rims where the three new tires were mounted were only hand tight and had to be torqued again by me.

If you value your life or vehicle DO NOT USE THIS SHOP!!<//Text><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Text>We visited from Fresno! Family of five,  $25 a ticket. (Expensive) 3 corn mazes, all of them were just a path, nothing to get lost in or try to find your way out. That was very disappointing. They had a great selection of pumpkins, and areas for taking pics.
The sunflower field was nice to walk through. Very disappointed in the food selection. We were hoping for alot of food vendors (I'm 6 months pregnant) was hoping for the smell of kettle corn, candy apples, funnel cakes, etc.. ended up waiting 45min for warm, soggy nacho cheese chips. I liked being able to feed the goats and chickens, but maybe have more animals to see and pet! All the kid activities were free, the slide was slow going down, and the bouncing area was very crowded.  Everyone wore masks, but there was no social distancing whatsoever. I enjoyed most the lights and frights. Even tho it started at 730pm and we were done by 8pm, it was still fun.  We all got free glow sticks, a walk/trail of lights and inflatables, then a walk in a corn maze with electronics and a lil scares here n there.
We most likely won't be going again,  but we made a memory of it.< /Text>< pics>

Sunflowers to admire and also to pick some for $2 each.
Corn maze to spend good time.
Mega slider, jumping pillow, feeding goats, a mini train train for both kids and adults.

Had a great time. Lines were long for most activities. When spending the day with your little one, you need all day there. Bring some snacks, food line gets long. Trail of lights is great for children. Male sure to bring a jacket if you are doing the trail of light, it gets cold at night. Defenetly recomend it.</Review>

Not what it seems....the corn maze is boring, the food is bad, the admission is too high. THEY HAVE BUTTERFLIES IN PACKAGES SQUISHED. I talked to one of the workers there and they said they freeze them, pack them in tight seals, then sell them 10$ each</Review>

Extremly expensive, rude staff, packed with people without any masks being enforced during Covid. Nothing being disinfected in between uses.Long lines for everything with everyone piled against each other. The sunflowers were mostly all dried up, pumpkins were just in bins. Lots of employees not wearing masks. Security in this packed place just sitting around talking while the pitch dark corn maze had NO ONE watching people. We paid for the light walk, and waited on line for 50 minutes with it barely budging, and so we never got to EXPERIENCE it.
I can't believe they call this an experience. It's more like Swank Farms the DISAPPOINTMENT.
The food line was absurd and sold out of everything. Save your hard earned money for a decent farm with more trustworthy employees/owners not this trap.</Review>< Pics>

We are so sorry to hear that you missed out on the Trail of Lights and was let down by our sunflowers. Our sunflowers are weather reliant so we recommend coming to view them the first couple of weekends we are open during the fall season. We will take your input about our long lines throughout the farm into consideration as we work hard to improve our future seasons. Thank you again for coming to us about your experience on the farm. We hope we see you again for a second chance.'}</response>

<review>Nothing open but mazes and pumpkin patch
Pumpkins not included in pricey pass.  Pumpkins $1 a pound, last time we visited, years ago, the pumpkins were included.  Limited shade truly not worth the price of admission.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMah-ihAJJg50JeFg_hAVmCGRltQW8xju-3ciSF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Their unmasked, ungloved employee seller at Cupertino Friday market refused to sell produce to me. In the almost empty market at the end of the day around 1pm on 9/4/20 I tried to talk to this person named Jose, to purchase some produce and he kept ignoring to the point I left the stall. I waited for over 10 min giving him the concession of doubt but it wasn’t the case. Appalling! You should make your own call about the people at this company.</Review>

No social distance at all! Worst experience since covid. Was there maybe 15 mins.and left. Wish we hadn't purchase tickets online, so we could of seen before hand how crowded the place was. No refund was posted. Went to Casa de Fruta social distance inforced. Had a excellent dinner at there restaurant.<//review>

Paid like 60 bucks to get family in.  Picked sunflowers then waited in blazing sun no shade while they tried to get card machine working and wouldnt take cash.  Ended up throwing the flowers on ground and leaving.  Horrible experience.  My suggestion.  Go to bouchard farms in salinas. It's much better</text>

Swank farm creates one of the largest corn stalk mazes in the country each October. More than a mile square, intrepid adventurers enter the maze with a map and try and locate about 25-30 spots where they find words that complete the annual story. It is all good.m clean fun. Low wattage/ dim flashlights are a must.

The farm also features two bouncy pillows ( one for younger kids and one for older kids), peddle cart racing track, goat petting zoo, giant pumpkin slings and corn husk air cannons- all for one entry price. In addition, there is a scary-ish haunted house for older kids, a pumpkin patch, as well as home made fudge available for purchase.

Perfect for kids of all ages.

Note: it can get chilly at night so best to be prepared. Bring water bottles, flashlights and  closed shoes. If rain is forecast, know that the parking lot is dirt and will quickly turn muddy.</text>

<Review>Very family oriented and so many fun activities for both kids and adults. Only reason i gave it a 4 out of 5 is cause the prices are outrageous. Parking is free but the entrance is $29 per person. The gift shop prices are high as well and pumpkins are $0.50 a pound. You will spend a good amount of money but i guess you can say it's worth it for some.</Review><user>108664965919443482135< /user><date>1571637450346<//date><name>Rachel Rico<//name><pics>None< /pics><Rate>4<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Eeeeeh. Is it really worth it? Probably not. But it's a fun time.
Fudge is really good :)

2019 UPDATE

Gave it another try. This time we actually went to the day event not the Haunt at night like I did before. And I must say it was a great experience!! So many things to do ALL INCLUDED  IN THE PRICE OF ADMISSION. I will without a doubt be back again next year. My son left wanting to comeback again.
Price is reasonable for all the activities it offers. One down side was that there wasn't enough staff to have pig races going. But it was still a whole lot of fun.< /Review>

<Text>My biggest annoyance is that you have to wait in a super long line (30+ minutes) to get your wristband even if you've purchased your tickets online. They should have a separate line for that. The corn was super tall this year! Always love the maze. They did get rid of the haunted house and instead have a fright walk with kitschy decorations. It was okay.</Text>< Time>

We had a very large group. We got there after 7:40pm on a Friday night. Not a huge crowd like years before, at this time. Lots of fun walking around with flash lights in the dark of the corn maze. Finding the clues. Grandkids had fun on the bouncy pillow in the ground, the bounce cow, riding the cow train, the slide, hampster wheel and walking the corn maze in the dark. We always find a couple of the numbers more than once. We've been going for years. Always enjoyable.< /review>

At first thought the new location was ehhh.... I was so wrong!  So much fun!!!!  I was overwhelmed at the amount of fun this haunt was.  The staff at the front gate were very helpful and welcoming.  Staff on hand once past the main is helpful and there are plenty of people if you have questions.  Now for the highlight of the event............. The Haunted Orchard in the back.  OMG!  The staff cast / actors while you wait in like are on point.  They never stop entertaining you, with either a scare or a laugh and are even willing to pose for pictures.  Once inside the haunt the decor is creepy and ominous with the cast eager to jump out at you around every corner. They make sure that everyone in your group is having a great time while being safe and scary.  Its what a true traditional haunt should be.... I have to say the new location gives a much better feel to the haunt with a larger corn maze and larger haunted trail. It was well worth every penny spent and I am planning on going again this weekend because it was so much fun.</Text>

Wow, this was a super fun destination!  Took my family mainly for the Haunt, but there was a lot more to spend the evening doing like the jumpy pillows, pig races, pretty tasty food, and of course the maze.

I read a couple reviews saying the staff wasn’t friendly or helpful - we had a completely different experience.  I lost my sunglasses and 2 employees spent at least 10 minutes helping me find them!

Side note, my kids are older so they didn’t get too scared in the haunt,  but there’s lots of frights - little little kids might have bad dreams!</Text>

To expensive for what the options are. My son and I paid $47 to get in! Yes, there are things to do but, not worth $47 at all. Maybe they should charge for kids only and not adults? They even charge .50 or $1 for feeding the goats after you’ve paid admission. We will be heading back to Spina or Uesgui next year.</Review>

A bit expensive and not much to do in front compared to past seasons. Probably because our kids are older now, but it wasn’t the same as represented online but good nonetheless. The haunted maze was what made it worth the drive from San Jose. My wife and daughter ran most of the way, but the guy in the goat head sincerily got me good. Would recommend back home.<//review>

Nice relaxing day time stuff for the younger kids — Corn Maze, pumpkin catapult, and more.  Night time terrors for the older kids — creeps and ghouls looking to scare the daylights out of you.  Fun for all, all day.</text>

<review>I dont know why im not allowed to give them zero stars. Were let in at 7. Waited in line for the trail of lights tour immediately, Waited for an hour in line after being told 5 more minutes the generator isnt working 5 times. The desk was extremely rude, when we asked for a refund they told us they dont issue refunds and theres nothing they can do. Cool, well wait for it to open and buy another over priced beer, nope bar is closed despite the tours starting no earlier than 730.  Absolutely rediculous. No customer service what so ever</review>< pictures>

This is such a great place, and I'm glad we found it! I really liked that the entry fee let you in and do everything as many times as you want. I believe the entry to the pumpkin patch is free which is nice too. My son spent hours on the jump pillow, in the corn maze, and loved the corn cannon. They have a really sweet little store where they sell fudge and I cannot stress to you enough how yummy it is! I got the oreo and mint chocolate. To die for!  We came back last Sunday so my husband and son could go through the haunt and my son nearly peed his pants! Lol over all it was a really fun experience and we look forward to next year.<//review>

<name>J Mills</name><Text>Overpriced and quick to kick you out. $30 entry, $40 if you're going into the haunted house. Beware the no refund policy, they do not hesitate to make use of it if you freak out and accidentally bump or hit one of the employees who jump out at you in the haunted house. All the food and everything inside is also overpriced despite you having paid a more than reasonable amount for entry. Desk workers also will forego honesty to try to sell you on the event, exaggerating the underwhelming haunted house in order to make the sale. Don't give them your money, there are far better places to go.</Text>< response>

<text>Before they moved, we looked forward to swank farm. Now they are like any other-staff not helpful, dusty and barren looking. Dinosaurs used to be out in the field-added to the excitement of the maze. Now they’re out by the street, like a tourist trap. The hay pile is half the size it was with eight porto pots right by it. Great photo opportunity! Ugh! We’re looking for a great place again.<//text><user_name>Peggy Langford< /user_name><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Omg, the haunted house was awesome we went Friday night. They had a giant room with fog and lasers that really tripped us out. we did get to explore the giant corn maze at night we got lost. Took us awhile to get out.  I'm definitely going again before Halloween.</Text>

I am still stunned.

3 years ago we went with a group of friends and had a frightfully good time. We liked it so much, we organized a group of friends to go this year.

When we went last time, the scare experience had no less than 25 to 30 actors, with unexpected scares at each turn.

Last night,  we saw six actors the entire time. Six.

The "Gorechard" was less thrilling and more tortured, consisting of our group walking through some Halloween scenery without Halloween thrills.

If you have kids, the rest of the farm is no doubt fun during the day.

But Gorechard was my biggest waste of money this year.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>this place was so much fun, we went Saturday night for the haunted house. The line did get long but they kept us moving even when a fire truck and ambulance showed up. It must of been that scary for someone. The line hand a had full of different scare people in it, there was a guy with machetes' some creepy monster on 4 legs and even a giant Clown with a chainsaw. Once we got inside a little girl got me jumping. there was a few good scares in there. One girl from my group got scared so bad she peed herself, lol. We all had a great time and we will be back again this weekend! keep up the great work.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Updated review: The owner took the time to personally reach out to me and talk about my experience. I was impressed with how much he genuinely cared. It's possible I happened to visit on a day they had staffing issues or something else was going on. My unedited original review is below.

The Gorechard was just bad. Low effort, crappy props, they had like 4-5 "scarers" that just kind of follow you around. No one popping out. The makeup and masks were nothing special. I had more fun standing in line than I did walking through the Gorechard. Honestly, the whole thing, props/costumes included could have been put together for 150 bucks at a clearance Halloween store. The corn maze was fun at dusk but that's about it.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1540499646726, 'text': 'Hi Bryan, we are so disappointed to hear this.

This is my kind of place, fun games, scary characters in the haunt, and restrooms in front and back (it is a large place would have hated to have to walk to the front to use the bathroom).

Long line for the haunt, but they have people that you got to keep your eyes out for, or they will a scare ya. In the haunt it was very zig zagging, and disorienting, with some actors whooshing by or stalking you from the distance. Never felt at ease in there. Got exactly what I paid for. Except when I ran in to an actor and slammed him into a wall. I felt bad cause I was full on running. But he seemed fine and even stayed acting. Good show.<//Review>

This place was the first haunted house experience I have ever had in my life and it got me hooked and that was 15 years ago.

This place has never disappoint me each time I go I really look forward to solving the fill in the blank with the maze.

Each year there is a new theme for the haunted house so you don't have to be afraid of experiencing the same thing as last year.

There are other things to do besides the haunted house such as the pedal karts, petting zoo, this year didn't have the pig. They have a pumpkin patch they have a kitty Zone this year they have added a train.

Your ticket price includes everything inside so you can go to the jumpy house as much as you want you can pedal cart as much as you want you can jump on the big pillow as much as you want.

It takes about one hour and a half to drive from Oakland to Hollister but I think it's worth it<//review>

Looks like there is way more to do on adverts but when you get there a lot of it isnt open or have someone there to help. Food is crazy expensive so take your own drinks. The mazes are riddled with potholes so make sure you dont wear any high heels or anything like that if you plan on going into them. Its ok but again, totally underwhelmed and not what i was expecting<//Text>

$20 was too much for what they offer. The pumpkin chucking was with a rope! Just dumb. 45 min of waiting for the corn cannon & the line didn't move an inch. Gave up. Didn't even get a pumpkin!< /Text>

Pumpkins, huge corn maze for adults or older children, smaller corn and hay mazes for little ones, pig race, pumpkin sling shot and more. It's pretty exposed, bring sun gear, and not quaint, but the activities are good.</Text>

It was horrible. Alot of people referred me here too so I came with my fiance and it sucked. It was a 45min wait line just to get the tickets, the 'Terror in the Corn' name is confusing because it's literally just a walk through the corn field. Nothing scary pops out, it's just a walk. Which is better than the haunted house because atleast it was suspenseful to walk in a dark cornfield with no lights. The haunted house isn't a house at all its outdoors, so you walk through the entire thing and they had to have been short of staff or just really sucked. Twice the group went the wrong way and the security screamed at them to go the right way which they should've had blocked off. It was barren, alot of walking space with no one popping out, alot of empty crevices and hiding spaces youd assume actors would come out of but they were empty. I get scared easily too but this was horrible. I wish I could get my money back. Especially the food stands. We wanted nachos they said its a 30min wait because their making a fresh batch, so we said ok, tacos then. They said its a 45 min wait because their cooking that too. So we just got churros and watered down hot chocolate. We went to another fudge store and ordered hot dogs and they had NO drinks inside the fridge except a few diet Pepsi and water. We had to wait 20min for them to get their delivery of soda to restock. The entire experience sucked. Tomorrow is my birthday so this weekend was supposed to be my birthday weekend of fun and it was ultimately a waste of my time, travel (I came from San jose) and a good $100. (39 per ticket so $78) for my fiance and I. Wish we could get our money back, entire way home I was pissed.</review>

<Text>I used to like coming here with the grandkids, but in the past I never was charged to come in and watch the kids, this year I had to pay and the place is nothing like the old location. I think they  Wed to go back to the old ways and people should not have to pay just to walk around with the kids. I will not be back with my family. Really not worth it anymore.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Honest to God, one of the worst Korean Barbecue I've ever had in my life. Not only was all the meat super low quality and greasy, the sides were somehow tasteless and the "beef rib" was all fat and no meat. I truly cannot convey how laughable the rib was with 98% fat and small specks of meat.

One of the servers was kind and assiduous, but for what it is, I cannot recommend this restaurant.  The reviews are truly misleading.< /Text>

They charged a hidden $9 fee "because they charge a fee for 3 ppl and over"! They should mention that when they sit people down.  plus bad customer service they had us waiting at the table a long time. i know the price is only $15 but they charge for rice separate when other places you can get that included. I've came here a couple of times and that is the last.< /Review>

I went here with my family last night and it was absolutely amazing. Don't let the simplicity of the place fool you.

We were seated immediately and the staff are very welcoming. The place is clean, cozy, and comfy. Just a perfect place if you want to de-stress and feast over barbecues.

For $10 per person, you can get unlimited servings of quality tasting Korean BBQ. My personal favorite was the wine marinated pork paired with their house kimchi. I will definitely go back to this place and recommend this to my friends.< /text>

<review>Be real careful when you pay because they will set a tip for you even if you didn't like the service. When you sit down it takes about 30 mins to even get your order taken. They use to have good service but I don't know if it's that they sat us in the corner but they payed little to no attention to us.< /review><name>Osvaldo Cortez<//name><pictures>None< /pictures><date>1615824872338</date><UserId.>110533963879935838714</UserId.>< Rate>

<Text>Every time I visit it's awesome! If your a lover of Korean BBQ like myself this hidden gem is a definite must try. The $9.99 all you can eat special is unbeatable with 3 different types of meat, an abundance of delicious sides and great customer service. If you're ever in the area and hungry you must stop by.<//Text>< pics>

For the price, you can't beat it. The all you can eat meat is good. The staff is attentive, the environment is casual, and the wait isn't bad. If you are looking to eat until your gut bursts, this is the place for you.<//Text>

<Text>Pretty tasty food for the price. The quality of the meats are what you would expect from an all you can eat Korean BBQ. Decent but nothing groundbreaking. The sides are tasty and plentiful and as many mentioned the rice is extra.

I would have given this place 5 stars as the service my friend and I had for the first half of our meal was fantastic, but for the second half our waiter disappeared. Literally we did not see him for the rest of our meal and nobody else took care of the table. If you want decent Korean BBQ for a good price though this place is still up there.</Text>< Pics>

I loved the 1st time I went here but the second time I was told they could not serve me because I was alone and they don't serve 1 person. I was disappointed and upset about it.

Me and my family have been going here for years  and we always enjoys ourselves.  The staff are friendly and very attentive. Sometimes there is a small wait but its worth it. If you choose to go to this place you won't be disappointed.  It's small but satisfying.<//Review>

Underrated spot that gets a lot of heat for its service. For the price you pay for AYCE which is way under 20 bucks at around 16 bucks it can’t be beat. The quality of meat and selection is top notch. Owners are really cool so if you feel that service is a bit slow to come to you don’t be afraid to ask for help.</Text>

Saw a rat take a stroll through the restaurant. Not surprised though cause the place looks dirty and the meat is cheap. I called the Health Department to report them and they said they've gotten multiple complaints about the place.< /review>

<Review>Our server, Sam, was fairly impatient with the fact that it was our first time there. He got irritated because we didn't want to sit in a booth in the passage way. We picked a table 10 feet away and he said it's too far. Then he got irritated because we didn't know what we wanted to eat (ridiculous since he didn't provide menus). My husband had to tell Sam to not be so angry - it was our first time there. Sake is overpriced ($10 a bottle).
They got the 2 stars because the food was decent but that's about it.<//Review>< Time>

We love coming here for Korean BBQ with the whole family. I would like it a little bit more if they had kids prices for my five year old and 7 year old because they really don't eat that much. But they do like it, and it is a successful family meal every time we visit.<//Text>

Bad service. Took a while to get us started. We raised our hand to get a new grill but we were being avoided but it was good for half the time there until they dropped sauce on the floor and it went on us. They said sorry and moved on. After we finished eating we payed and exited but a waitress expected a five to ten dollar tip and also gave us a dirty look because we only gave a small tip. She should have been lucky we even gave a tip.<//Review>

This place is really a gem. The 9.99$ all you can eat is delicious and they keep all the condiments coming. I came on a Wednesday evening and the service was courteous and prompt. The meats are very fresh, the sides where well seasoned, service was great. The pineapple soju is smooth and packs a nice warm punch to help all the delicious food go down. Me and my family where very happy with the whole experience. Modest, humble and very well managed atmosphere at this place. I will be coming back soon.< /text>

I used to come here often and the service gets progressively worse. We were pointed to our seats by a waitress and quickly forgotten.

We sat at the table for about 20 minutes without anyone offering as much as water.

Probably will be the last time I dine here.

Apart from the bad service experience however, their tables are all extremely greasy and gross to the touch, and the cups/utensils hardly look sanitary.< /review>

My family and I go here every once in a while. The staff is always friendly, on point, and quick. The quality of the meat is great as well. This place is literally half the cost of other AYCE KBBQ. Its 11.99 per person and you have 3 meat options. They have 2 other prices and they include other meats but the 11.99 package is perfect for us. Plus they have great prices on their drinks too. We have gone here for a long time now and not once have we ever had a problem or an issue with our orders. Even when their busy the longest we have waited for has been 30 minutes which isnt bad at all considering the fact that some places have an hour plus wait for two to three times the price. We are a family of five so the price makes a big difference.  For kids they charge half the adult price which is awesome, specially if you have kids that eat a lot.

I Reccomend this place to all my family and friends looking for a great place to eat.<//text>

It's good for the price. I usually get the $9.99 selection which has brisket, pork belly, and spicy pork. There is a $14.99 and a $19.99<//review>

On cold days, forgo the korean bbq and go for the spicy shreaded beef soup. Lots of flavor and very comforting.

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I came in with my significant other recently. We were lead to a table and sat down. For about 15 minutes and no one came to us to get us started. I had to call one of the workers to get us the basic things. I'd understand if it was actually busy that day. We asked if we could get our grill changed which didn't happen. After we pay and as we are exiting the door they seriously chase after us for a tip. I always tip for exceptional service but this obviously wasn't.<//text>< pictures>

Food is 5 stars, however the service is definitely 1 star. Took forever to get a refill of water, asked a guy for the check and he said "yeah sure" and never came back. took us 20 minutes just to get the check. Not to mention no one ever came by to ask if we wanted more meat or rice or anything.< /text>

<text>Had been going there forever until an encounter I had recently. The service was horrible, we had to ask for things multiple times and they still forgot most of it. Gratuity was automatically added onto our bill and we felt they did not deserve it so we asked the owner to remove the tip and she WENT OFF. She said "how are you not going to tip?" and told us to "never come back". Note taken. Don't eat here, they are horrible problem solvers and management does not take responsibility for their wrong doings.<//text>< Pictures>

I got to say this Korean barbecue place is great. This is the one place I would go since it's close to where I live in Norwalk California. It's in Artesia, the brisket is awesome and they give you tons of it. They give you sides as well, spicy cucumber, kemchi, Pata to salad and more. It's an affordable place and you can bring the whole Family if you'd like. Did I mention Tv's and Beer to📺🍻< /text>

<text>Nice price for unlimited meat. $10 starting meal per person. I go all the time, its a nice place for social dates :) Service varies. Most of the time they are very attentive with drinks, sides, and the status of the grill.They do accept splitting the bill. My favorite korean bbq!< /text>< response>

Really good Korean bbq at an incredible price. I've notice that the server pays attention to you for like the first 30 minutes of your meal; then after, they stop checking in on you. I waited like 20 minutes wanting more meat. Before you order, you should make sure that they have the meats you want; we ordered the #2 and they ran out of beef tongue so we basically paid $6 extra for bbq ribs that taste similar to bbq pork belly and chicken. Price varies from $9.99 - $18.99, boiled egg is extra and rice is extra. You're also forced to tip no matter lack of service.<//Text>

Came on a pretty busy day, took forever to find the sign in clipboard.. guy was walking around with it so much it was almost nonexistent.

Pretty cheap as it comes $9.99 for Brisket, Pork Belly and Spicy Chicken, there are two more options as well for more meat options.

Not a terrible place to get your KBBQ fix but the waiters can be all over the place. Staff is relatively friendly though.< /text>

<review>Had been here before and the experience has been fine, until today.
Its all you can eat right? Only was there for the most an hour, We asked for a second serving of bbq and were rejected our second serving because the kitchen was "closed".
No one told us they were closing the kitchen or was curtious enough to ask us if we wanted more because they were closing.
We asked if we can get a discount because we couldnt get the second serving we rudely rejected by the OWNER and forced to pay full price.
If you want to go to a korean bqq resturant with horrible costumer service this is the place.< /review><Time>1514362122248< /Time><Rating>1< /Rating>< userid>

I ordered brisket and guess what they give you... beef belly... cheapest part... I ordered beef short rib.. they give you part thats considered not short rib. Charge $3 for 12 garlic slices without even telling you. Btw beef belly is part where you get from YOSHINOYA BEEF BOWL. SO IF YOU DON't wanna waste your money on low as quality meat and get ripped off.. please don't go to this one. There are lot more places with better price with quality meat.<//Review><time>1481431281987< /time><user>100144698346452593858</user><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Went through the drive through today. There was a line in the drive through, so I patiently waited my turn. But was surprised by the lack of customer service. I asked to get grilled chicken instead of fried and was told I can not do any modifications to my sandwich or I would have to choose a sandwich that already had grilled chicken on it because they are short staffed....umm what?? I know it’s not Burger King but I didn’t realize I was asking for that much! And apparently he is the manager (Max). I pulled up to the window and the gal that took my money was very pleasant but then Max came to the window to hand me my food. Instead of handing it to me, he practically threw it at me as if I was the slow one. No smile, no have a nice day...just here here’s your food! Well let me tell you what...you got the order wrong (even though you took forever to take it) and the food was apparently just thrown in the bag (or maybe that is how you handled it)! Guess I’ll have to take my “modification” some where else!< /text>

<Text>Does the job, munchies fix. Considering the busy location/intersection, in and out quick. Never had a problem when stopping by. Orders have always been accurate. Usually grab on the way to out of town appointments, as it is at freeway on ramp. Convenience wins.< /Text><user_name>Tori Garcia< /user_name>< Rating>

SUPREME CROISSANTS ARE GOOD, BUT OUR JUMBO JACKS WERE "VERY" CHARCOAL BROILED & WELL DONE.  NO INDOOR SEATING NOW (COVID~19).
THE STAFF WAS VERY GOOD & QUITE KNOWLEDGEABLE.
BTW: MUST ENTER FROM JEFFERSON ST. ONLY ON THE SE SIDE STREETS.
NOTE: DO THE 2~MINUTE SURVEY ON RECEIPTS & $AVE BIG $$!<//Review>

This Jack in the Box is our bona fide go to Jack's! Food, service and prices are always good. When we crave good and tasty fun food we go get a Jumbo Jack, curly fries and a shake! And tacos too!</Review>

The 4 star review is only because although my food is hot for the most part, your fries are a hit or miss when I order them, both curly and regular fries.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Great food but I was insulted and disappointed with the label in Big Bear Lake City - Jack in the box. Discrimination is acceptable in their franchise business. I don't know with other franchise locations if they have the same motto placed close to the counter. See the picture I took. Hope no discrimination. I supposed not to buy food in Jack in the Box Big Bear city location but no other option based on our budget. Hope service is rendered to everyone.</text><user>117384462044527314366< /user>< Time>

<text>If four stars seems like a lot for a fast food place, its because I'm ranking it as a fast food place. I'm not saying four star restaurant... This particular Jack in the Box is always fast and friendly. And... Tacos! I don't know what it is about those tacos, but I can't resist them. Sometimes I just crave them, and the craving doesn't stop until I get some. All this talk about Jack in the Box tacos is making me hungry...</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< user_id>

The coffee was not fresh. The breakfast Jack was dry and the egg was over cooked and the bread was dry, sitting too long under the heat lamp. I was looking forward to fresh coffee and breakfast Jack. It was 5:45 A.M.
At that time of morning you think that the food should fresh.
Should not be selling old food that has been sitting too long under the heat lamp. 11/30/19</text>

Wait time was slightly long. However, the cashier was super nice and she divided everyone's order perfectly in their bags without us even asking. I mean how many fast food restaurants do that! That was awesome! She also gave a bunch of extra condiments which we appreciate as we love condiments.<//Text>

My friends and I went to get some food after a night of drinking across the st. We were assisted by Asia in the drive thru and she was extremely patient and attentive to our needs. I know we were drunk and made longer decisions on our order and Asia was so professional making sure we were happy and also asked if we needed water or extra condiments. Asia was so sweet!!!< /Review>

<text>It was average for a fast food place, although below par for JitB (especially the better one a few miles South at 79S.) I was a bit early for lunch and there was no ice in the machine. Had to wait for ice. I tried the triple chicken sandwich, and while it tasted good, it could have been better. Mainly in that the cheese was not melted at all. The patties could have been warmer. I dined in and was not in a hurry. Upon leaving it was becoming main stream lunch and still no ice.</text>< Pictures>

Food tasted terrible. I Love JITB, but this location was just not good. Flavorless!
The Manager was also very mean to the cashier who helped me. The cashier was very nice and helpful. A young student who's assistance I appreciated! He was the Only reason they got a 🌟.< /review>

<Review>I I hate coming to this particular Jack in the Box. It seems like they only have one worker. Cooking and running the window. It just took the gentleman in front of me 20 minutes to get two cups of coffee. If I was going to wait until 6 a.m. To get food, I would have just waited for Del Taco to open. Management needs to figure out what they're doing because their Associates are suffering.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>I went to this place Jack in the Box yesterday for lunch it took them 15 minutes how to get my food to me my fries are cold my food is called I tried to use the bathroom when I walked in there I looked and it was still piss all over the toilet and both bathrooms I told the one of the workers there that the bathroom you need to be clean that there was piss everywhere and all over the seats and toilet he said I'll get to it when I can no why do you say that because he's lazy manager heard me didn't tell him to go in and do it 20 minutes later when I'm eating my food comes up and says the bathrooms clean you could go and use it now 20 minutes later really now 50 minutes to get my food to me and cold with no apologies and when my order was given to me it was supposed to be inside the store not to go and I was supposed to be served to me on a tray not in a bag and not with the here you go that's it I'm sorry it took so long or anything just deal with it attitude I will never go to this place ever again and I do not recommend anybody to go to this particular Jack in the Box on Jefferson and Winchester in Temecula worst experience of my life</review></record></dataset><record>

I eat at J.B. atleast once a week there are four that I go to in my area, I also work in the area, that J.B. is the worst, the one thing that stands out to me is the service there never consistent and very sloppy, I'm talking every time, and I've been to that one plenty of times to know I'm taking a chance when I go to that J.B. winchester and Jefferson. I did want to give a star at all I've been disappointed so many times!< /Text>

Went thru the drive thru to get a shake. The woman taking drive thru orders said the shake was $2 so i didnt pay attention when i gave her my credit card.  I noticed later i was charged nearly twice that amount. I would have given one star, but the shake was  yummy..</Text>

< Review>
I didn't go to Jack In The box and they have been in the shopping center where there was a Jack In The box but I haven't been in the Jack-in-the-Box and over 20 years. these reviews are not quite Fair because they're asking me to review places that I have not been into or actually visited. So it's very unfair for me to give this any kind of a grade.<//Review>

It's Jack in the Box... The tacos should only be eaten if you are high or drunk (preferably both). The unlimited drink combinations is a plus over other restaurants but other than that ...it's Jack in the Box.</Review>

I was left standing at the front counter for almost 2 minutes before someone came to help me even though 2 employees saw me standing there. Thankfully the lady was short because while taking my order she coughed right into the register without covering her mouth. I only 3 customers there the whole time I was there. The floors, chairs and tables were dirty/greasy. I will never eat at this location again< /review>

Food was good until my son found a black hair in his food, told the manager and blamed it on me (I have brown hair and my son is blond) then I mention to him that I haven't seen the cashier wash her hands once since we have been there and she had on gloves because of a cut she had on her finger , but he watched her touch her hat once, her hair once and her face without washing her hands , and she was still dealing with food. Absolutely disgusting!!</text>

<Review>I love how they will make your food just how you want it. If you go, ask for the fries to be cooked well done. OMG they are so good, nice and crispy on the outside side and soft in the inside.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
It's just okay. Chain of restaurants all run the same. The surrounding area presents a challenge for you to get in and out as traffic on the main street can be unforgiving. Total quality of the location was mediocre, the food matches the same as any other location maybe a bit less fresh then others.</Review>

It's an average Jack in the Box. Clean, inexpensive food, burgers range anywhere from $1-5. When I feed a group of 5 guys, it runs $10-15 less when I go here, than to Carl's for similar meals.</Text>

This one took a while to process. Normally I'd respect the flow if it was packed but we were the only customers at that time.</review>

Those panko breaded onion rings kill it. Kind of. But the best fast food rings. Remind me of what they used to be when I was a kid, and JitB always had the best rings. Get the rings.<//review>

The worst Jack in the Box! Slow, help gets easily confused on orders, especially employee Salome. Floor was sticky. Bathrooms were okay. Tables all needed to be wiped down, instead employees stood around yacking.< /text>

< Review>
The most disgusting place! Very rude and lazy employees. Homeless hang around and do drugs right outside the doors of this restaurant! Hit or miss when it comes to the food or service. Bathrooms are absolutely terrible, piss all over the floors and toilets, trash all over the floor! Not to mention, the dining area is messy and tables are sticky, It’s always like that. I have been to this jack in the box more than a few times hoping they’d get it right but I will no longer come back. Every time I come, employee Salome is there. He is completely rude and acts like an imbecile, I believe he is the manager but nonetheless he is unprofessional and whoever owns that jack in the box needs to hire a new manager to do it right.</Review>
