Excellent pizza!! Like, really fresh, really delicious. Every time. Usually arrives ahead of the estimated time also. Excellent breads also. The wings are a no-go but the pizza makes up for it. The only issue is ordering is such a hassle. I wish they would hire a new web designer or fix their website or something because trying to order from their website makes me crazy. The pizza is still worth the headache of ordering, it's really that good.< /text>

<Text>First time going here, decided to try a different pizza place, there are so many in Redlands. Ordered a pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and cashews pizza and a side of BBQ wings. I was a little worried but I was very pleased with the pizza and wings. They were a lot better than I expected. The crust was great and they put a lot of toppings. I hate pizza places that are chintzy on the toppings but this place is not one of them. The wings were good too.  I will definitely be back. It also got my wife's approval, she loved it too.<//Text>< rate>

<text>A+ amazing pizza.  My friends and i ordered custom pizzas and they were sO GOOD. i cannot express just how good they were. We ordered an alfredo inspo and philly cheesteak inspo pizza and there was zero disappointment.  This place is on the pricier end, i think we spent about 60$ for 3 medium pizzas and had it delivered to the yucaipa calimesa area, but its worth it.< /text>< date>

Great pizza always prepared hot and fresh. Shop is located in a somewhat inconspicuous location but is centrally located in the downtown Redlands area. I've tried a variety of different kinds they offer and all have been good. They also allow you to customize your pizza however you'd like if you choose to do so.</Text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>The pizza is great. However the last two times I've ordered online my orders have been prepped wrong. I don't think the people making the pizza actually look through the order. I ordered specialty pizzas with some modifications but they just came as the normal special. I.e.: ruins the pizza when it's covered in hot sauce and you didn't want hot sauce.  Needs better online ordering, or people to actually take their time reviewing orders.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>My family decided to give this place a try because of the high reviews.....It was dreadful. Our first pizza was burned, black edges and very dark brown crust.
When we called they said they would make us another one. When I picked up the new pizza the were completely unapologetic and condescending, opening it in my face and asking "is this one okay?" ( If you dont know the answer to that question and thought the first was good, then you shouldn't be making Pizza)
Sadly the (good) pizza wasnt good either. The crust was still overdone, dry, and tasted kind of burned. There was too much cheese distributed unevenly and caked together, but the worst part was the sauce.
I love spicy food, but you shouldnt make your base sauce too spicy that kids cant eat it, if somebody wants spicy pizza they can add red pepper.
Like some other reviews mentioned, the sauce was way too spicy for my child to eat. So after all the money spent, two trips, I still didnt have edible food for my family. TRASH, not going back.<//Review><date>1573598085820</date><user_id>105493310254979699417<//user_id>< Rating>

Sad to say I had a vegan pizza and found a couple pieces of chicken on my pizza. They are aware of the problem and I truly hope the owner works to make the workspace clean for all types of health choices.< /Text>

<review>I don't know what this place does for dough, but it's some of the most unique pizza dough I've ever had. I liked it. I ordered their buffalo pizza and my girlfriend ordered a vegan pizza - we both liked it. One star off because I felt the price was a bit high, but I come from AZ where everything is a bit cheaper so it's hard for me to gauge.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Good pizza. Good customer service. Good local delivery spot. A little on the pricey side for what it is but would definitely go back.< /Text>

They get a lot of stuff right with their pizza, but there's something about the dough that's off - like they don't really use fresh dough that often. It frequently tastes like old dough that's been left in the fridge for a week.< /Text>

Sad to say I had a vegan pizza and found a couple pieces of chicken on my pizza. They are aware of the problem and I truly hope the owner works to make the workspace clean for all types of health choices.< /text>

Fast service. Terrible pizza.  Limp crust and sauce tastes like tomato paste with zero seasoning.  This was possibly the most bland peice of pizza I've ever had in my life.<//review>

If I could, I would give this place 0 stars. The dough has no flavor whatsoever, and the cheese is also bland. Literally had to drench it in spices and Parmasian to give it flavor. Not ordering from here again.</review>

<text>Their pizza is terrible. They are obviously padding their own reviews because there is NO WAY anyone in their right mind could say this was good.  I can't even say it's better than Little Ceasers but it's three times the price.  Rip off...  It should be a $5 pizza at best.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

We had a Dairy Free and a Gluten Free pizza and not only the pizza was overpriced but it tasted horrible, can’t believe this place claims to have a healthy pizza with great taste when frozen pizza out of the microwave taste better than this, maybe they were just having a bad day and decided to hurt my stomach with that pizza but from now I’ll not be coming back.</Review>

My favorite food in the whole world is pizza.   They are trying to make pizza they just not doing a good job that it.  They pizza has no taste...  And if they don't  start reading these reviews and make some changes they will be out of business.<//Review>

Awesome workout facility. Amazing trainers and people. They give amazing, killer workouts with a roll out after. I love being able to come to shift and put in my all knowing that with their help and encouragement I will get to the next level. I will definitely recommend it to my friend! Keep up the great work!</Review>

<text>As a former athlete and someone who used to be in the fitness industry, I can speak to my experiences that SHIFT South Bay is a phenomenal gym owned by great people. I have been training at the gym for a few months now in their new space in the Riviera, and have thoroughly enjoyed doing so. They are on the cutting edge of holistic, functional training, and it's a great space with a great community of clients and trainers. Ryan and Brandon, the co-owners, are good people with a passion for fitness, and they do a fantastic job connecting, mentoring, and working with athletes of all ages. If you're looking for a gym with a welcoming, personal touch that is also serious about results and is constantly improving in their new space, SHIFT is an excellent choice.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I absolutely love this gym it is clean they play the right music. Brandon(very welcoming) greeted me and my friend immediately when we walked in he was patient and listened to my friend and all of her wants and needs, then he set us up for an assessment with Ryan and he was completely wonderful he had my friend feeling great his attitude and energy is great my friend is paralyzed from her chest down and he got real creative with her work out you can tell he really enjoys and lives what he does, he had me ready to join. I would recommend SHIFT to everyone and they are also moving to a bigger location so I can just imagine what it is gonna be like.<//text>

I found Shift  originally for my son to improve strength and speed for football. After he joined I decided to give Shift a try! No regrets! My son has gotten stronger/faster and his confidence for football has improved. I’m in a small group training where Ryan trains us with intense workouts 5 days a week. I never leave Shift disappointed! Shift is definitely the best gym in the area!</Review>

<text>Best training place in the South Bay for athletes that want to get to the next level and achieve their dreams.  Since my son has gone there he has improved his body and picked up several mph on his fastball and been able to pitch longer in games without getting tired.   Ryan is the most dedicated trainer around and spends hours with his athletes in and out of the gym going beyond the duties of just a physical trainer.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b506948fdd77:0x9a5ca2f759397cfc< /Gmap_id></record>

As cliche as it sounds, training at shift has truly changed my life. Ryan has become almost a second father to me. He’s helped me overcome mental and physical barriers that kept me from performing my best. Training at shift has given me a second family and has provided the perfect competitive atmosphere for me to grow as an athlete and person. Ryan and Chris have a genuine personal investment in each athlete that can’t be matched anywhere else.<//Text>

I could not be more thankful for Shift_AP! Before joining Shift, I had been doing two workouts a day with minimal change in stamina or physic.  Shift has changed the way I workout, and I have never felt better. Having Ryan keep me accountable makes such a difference.  I am not an athlete, or training to be one, but Ryan provides the best workouts for everyone!<//text>

I write this with an  absolute heavy heart full of disappointment, regret
and astonishment.  I was profoundly and  disrespectfully treated when I asked for a refund of my 14 year old son's membership fee .I requested a refund since  he only trained one day after signing up with Shift...He suffers from acute migraines and as such his workout proved too much. On the advise of his Pediatric Neurologist to cease all training I asked three times for a refund, once to Ryan the Principal and twice to Brandon.   co-owner. I was met with a Cavalier and highhanded response by Brandon  who said a refund is not possible furthermore after offering to cancel my membership as well as my son's he commanded me to "GET OFF  HIS PROPERTY AND NEVER COME BACK.HE IS THE OWNER OF THIS GYM"
Since the day of Shift's  grand opening I have been a loyal and dedicated client of Ryan, working hard and telling all my friends of how talented Ryan is as a trainer.
Unfortunately  it's not about talent or having the latest training techniques.It's has a great deal to do with Good Customer Service.

Shame on you Ryan for not coming down on the side of your Client.<//text>

Training at Shift has allowed me the opportunity to grow not only physically, but also mentally. Shift’s intense environment is the perfect setting to train in, and the equipment is top-notch. Ryan, Chris, and Peter are all committed to helping you push your limits and reach your true potential athletic goals.</text>

My son has been training with coaches Ryan and Chris over the past year and he has had a great experience, he has made great strides in strength and flexibility and it has really helped him with his baseball skills. We are very happy to be part of this gym.< /Text>

This review is specifically for one of the brokers at this establishment.  I  am an existing customer and had placed a request for a quote for landlord insurance during the previous week on the same property for a different provider.  I called back on Thursday of the next week for follow up and subsequently got an email for a Liz Bautista that my quotes were coming within the next few hours.  Then I got an email saying that she needed my date of birth and the address of my primary residence.  This is the first time that I've been asked for personal sensitive information for a quote on a rental property.  After I provided her with the info then she said she could not submit my request as well as told me that she could not transfer me to her supervisor regarding my concerns of how disclosing sensitive information to her and then without submitting for the quote she was able to determine that she could not help me.  I have other rental policies and this is the first time I've had to disclose this type of info or been told that there would be an issue of insuring one rental because of having others.</Text>

I was referred to Western Gold by a friend who has been very happy with her experience there. My agent, Chris Barrett has been great from the start! Because I live in a high fire area, I've had issues finding the best coverage at a great price . Chris went above and beyond and found it for me for both my home and autos. He's super helpful and has a great sense of humor! Thanks Again!< /text>

<review>I own residential and commercial real estate. Over the years Patrick Marino has found insurance for more and more of my properties when other agents quoted me expensive insurance with inadequate coverage. Patrick has found typical insurance products at great values and has found difficult coverage products in a timely manner. Sometimes a real estate deal won't work unless you can get specific insurance. I have been very pleased with his timely professional service.<//review>< Pictures>

Response to their response... It's actually easy to make me happy, provide good service and don't try to sell me stuff I don't need.  Nobody who drives as little as I do needs $300k of coverage. Especially given the region I drive in has no traffic. The odds of me using that coverage are next to zero.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

As part of our professional service, we make sure you are properly covered should you need to actually use your insurance.  We would rather lose a sale than put you financially at risk.  Judging by your ten 1 star reviews of various businesses, seems you're difficult to make happy."}< /resp>

We do not usually open our mail, but when I read your most informative letter, I had to call. I am certainly glad, because our savings, increased coverage, and new Umbrella Policy are really nice after two years of bad news. I sent your letter to my agent. He surprisingly said it was all true. He apologized for not being able to offer the same coverage. He hoped we would stay, but he understood if we left. Thank you for being honest with coverage information. We feel great with the better coverage and wonderful savings. We sometimes had our doubts about always getting a good price from our agent and company. You were right. We felt protected by brand name logos and slogans. We didn’t know the company you suggested us being with was best for us. Thanks for explaining Allied Nationwide’s ratings. We feel good about changing. We got a great policy, great advice and great agents. Our agent never really called except at time of renewal. We appreciate your annual Birthday letters and calling us just to say “Happy Birthday” always brightens our day.</Text>

I logged in my YELP account to write a review for Western Gold Insurance. To my amazement, I couldn't believe how many bad reviews they received. For first timers, who is looking to use an insurance agency, don't believe everything you read. I read all the reviews, and most of the complaints were about people getting insurance solicitations in the mail, and wanted to be off the mailing list! I received the same solicitation in the mail, and decided to give them a call. Let me tell you, they (Liz) picked up the phone right away. In 15 minutes, I gave her all my information, and she said that she'll get back with me tomorrow with the quotes. THE VERY NEXT DAY, I received in writing my insurance quotes. The quotes were lower than my current carrier (Farmers), so I signed up for the new policy, and saved some BUCKS!!! Over all, Liz was very courteous and helpful. If you want to save some $$$, going through Western Gold Insurance should be your first choice.</Text>

<Review>My experience with Western Gold Insurance was great, I dealt with Liz , B. I received a mailer for home insurance, when I called them Liz answered the phone and looked up the best rate and best company for me and it was half the price I was paying with State Farm with the same coverage, I was amazed at the speed and great service I received from Liz, even the next day when I called her to ask a question it was two minutes to five pm, she was on her way out but she took time to answer my question for like 10 min, I really appreciated her working with me as a customer and not looking at me in just dollar signs.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>Horrible, Chris Barrett wrote up an insurance policy for us without us asking him.  We have a good policy on that property through October, 2015, and because I asked him for a quote, he wrote up a policy starting June(?).  I never asked for the new policy, I did not need it, but it caused a lot of problems with the Mortgage holder and I had to pay a penalty.  Is he just surfing ytrough papers or does he think that asking for a quote is a sale?< /text><name>Gabi Kao< /name>< Rate>

I've been using a large auto insurance company for as many years as I can remember. Recently, I received my policy renewal and the rates had increased substantially. I decided to call Western Gold to compare rates and spoke with Becky. Not only did she save me money on my auto insurance, but also on homeowner's insurance. I recommend giving Western Gold a try for all your insurance needs.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Western Gold has been our insurance company for at least three years, and I've never had a problem with their service. We just sold two condos, which they insured.
My husband called our agent, Becky Pister, to inform her we sold the properties, gave her the two different closing dates, and she cancelled the policies and we received the prorated checks back without any problem. She is very efficient and I found the rates very competitive.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>I received a letter from WG last month for my homeowners insurance. I usually have a hard time finding insurance because I live in Simi Valley which is a brush area. So I called to see if they could really insure my house. I ended up getting a quote on my cars and home as a package. The prices were actually competitive and service was very good. They were able to help me even though most companies can't. over all good experience.</Review><gmapID>0x80e8214d6e6edbf7:0xc6eb3766a5ddf7d5<//gmapID><Response>None<//Response>< pics>

Patrick Marino is an excellent agent and attentive to his clients' needs. He takes the time to explain the coverage options available, but will make sure you get the most economical policy that still offers the correct amount of coverage.<//Text>

<text>I have insured with this agency for years and have Patrick Marino as my account associate. Over the years I have found him to be rather brusk and outright unprofessional. The only reason I have not moved on is that I have several policies with them and have not taken the time to shop around; that will change! In order to deal with his attitude I limited my communication with him to emails- even that does not seem to help. Last week I requested a home owners policy quote, and informed him that I will be in touch. At my request I had a team member follow up with him to confirm the quote. Last night I received a docu-sign request from the insurance carrier, and noticed that the application had a vital error. This morning I received an email from Patrick Marino requesting my signature. I immediately replied stating the error, and requesting that it is corrected and returned for signature. The tone and content of his response was, simply put, downright rude. He demanded that I sign the incorrect application otherwise it will be cancelled. I did eventually speak with someone who is supposed to be in charge, not that I expect anything to come out of it...
**It should be noted that prior to writing this review, I took the time to read what others had to say. Of concern, this agent's name keeps appearing and not in a flattering way!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1522257883548, 'text': 'Hello Syl,\n\nThank you for your feedback.  Your verbal complaint was brought to my attention yesterday by a supervisor.  I have reviewed your recorded telephone call with William yesterday and your emails with Patrick.  I also discussed your situation with Patrick.  The emails were not intended to sound harsh.  While I agree the emails were not up to our standards, there was not an intention by Patrick to be rude or kurt.  He was simply attempting to convey the importance of getting the application signed to prevent cancellation of the policy.  Writing emails can be tricky, what sounds fine to the author may be received poorly by the recipient.  After review, we agreed the email could have been stated better and have implemented changes in our email process to be sure your experience is not repeated.  We have many agents and staff in the agency.  If you decide to continue working with our agency, I am confident you will find someone here who will meet your standards.'}<//Resp>

I have had Patrick for 4 years. He is only interested in sales not service. They have a seperate customer service dept. So you get a differant person everytime. They messed up and did not report my insurance to the DMV so I had to take a day off and stand in line to fix the problem. Then they didn't report my balance on my home policy to the bank when I refi'ed my house. Costing me hours on the phone. Customer service didn't want to help at all want me to fix their mess. Finally they didn't report my insurance coverage on my new car to the bank so once again I had to beg them to do their job correctly.  Asked to speak with the office manager and was hung up on. Stay away!!!!!</review>

You state you received a different person each time you call, however you spoke to only two different reps.  Patrick made every accommodation to assist, but he is not a customer service representative.  He transferred you, as customer service is more efficient at answering the questions you were asking.

i was looking for the zero stars and couldn't find it, i have never dealt with such poor costumer service in my life, they made so many mistakes on my real estate policies and left me with a few properties without any insurance. they never call back and when you are able to get a hold of them they say they will call right back and they never do. i dealt with chris galinsky and kevin c sutton and one was worst then the other.</text>

<Review>My little baby angel just had his second procedure done by this vets office. (Cancerous lump removed and teeth cleaning) I’ve been going there for several years now and have had nothing but good experiences. They all seem to genuinely care about the animals, are very helpful and I never feel like they’re just trying to make a sale. I highly recommend this place. My dog, Maynard, is now all fixed up and ready to party!....well when he gets his sutures out in a couple weeks. Thank you Chico Creek Animal Hospital!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQJX3x_UbLTI1mvipDKbqUXnvczXrWqnAwSX7g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1UmcMwMjCMx4fpvUi6iFveieUMdBpILFjlCxD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I've been to a couple Vets around Chico, but I still wanted a permanent place for my animals that truly cared. I just never got that experience from any other place unfortunately....
And then i found Chico Creek Animal Hospital..
Hands down the only Vet I'll ever take my animals to now.
My mom's dog, My Terrier & My cat are all patient's here.
The staff is so over the Top freaking Nice!!! They really care about you & your pet & they show it. Each time that we have came for our pet's & showed concern the staff really makes you feel like everything will be okay & they will take care of business. They're really thorough. And call a lot to let you know how everything went if your pet stayed for an appointment & then they call to check on your pet after their appointment. The vet office really does let you know every detail of what's going on & they really want updates & check in regularly. They absolutely Care. I'll never go to another veterinarian now. Wish I found them sooner.< /Review>< Pics>

Dr. Troy Young takes the time (and then some!) to explain everything from diagnosis to all your options. I've always had  canine companions during my long stay on this planet and I have found Dr. Young treats my dogs like they were his own. Couldn't be happier with Chico Creek Animal Hospital.</text>

Very clean, caring and professional office and staff. When another vet had seen my cat and failed to schedule the correct surgery for her, I was recommended to Chico Creek Animal Hospital by my father. They were able to get her into surgery the very next day without any issues. The DR called me during the procedure to advise me on some complications and showed concern and options for me and my cat. Sheba is home and doing great and recovering. This is now my vet for all our animals. Even asked their staff to have our other animals records sent over to them!</Text>

Great little clinic! I take my cat here for her check ups and yearly shots. Affordable pricing, rabies was $20 and the other preventive shots were $33. Quickly noticed that my cat was slightly overweight and told me ways to counter that and it worked right away. Also didnt know my cat had fleas til i went in and the Revolution for a month is $15. 10/10 recommend and ill be back every year!< /text>

The best vet. They are reasonably priced and the vet is great with animals and will work with your budget when he can. They are busy so try to make an appointment ahead of time at least a week or two. They sometimes can work you in anyway if you ask. Great location and plenty of parking. The staff all seem friendly and seem to care. Stay with your pet during shots, they will work with you on that too.< /review>

Great veterinary office! The vet is great with my dog and knowledgeable! Doesn't push unnecessary testing that I've felt pressured to get done other places. I trust that if he does say extra tests need done, then they are needed because of this! Prices are the best in town, and every employee is friendly and you can tell they really care about animals!< /review>

<review>Best animal hospital I've been to in 10  years!  The staff are friendly and professional, the facility is beautiful.  I love how clean the place is and all the special attention that went into making the inside warm and inviting.  I must say that their website is very well done, easy to navigate and well thought out.  Dr. B is amazing!  I love the way he handles my animals, it is obvious that he is very comfortable and just has that touch that you rarely see in today's vets.  What I like most about Chico Creek Animal Hospital is that I can trust them!  I never have to second guess or walk away not knowing what is going on!  Clean, professional, and at the top of their game!</review><user_id>109050741531922596254< /user_id>< response>

This office is so welcoming even after buddy had taken a leak on the front desk. I did not wait long at all maybe five minutes. The doctor was so informative. He gave me all the options for my dog and then told me what he would do if it was his dog, Buddy had a broken tooth but the doctor told me we could remove it but if buddy is not in pain than we should just leave it. I like doctors that are not trying to get money out of me and that right there proves he is not. He spent a good amount of time with me and asked many questions about my dog. He was asking questions about things that I was not in there about. He worked up a plan with me and the assistant came in and showed me what i would be charged on a laptop. Very fair prices for everything i got. I was thinking i would be spending so much more. He truly seemed concerned about him. I can't express how much i love this office.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Dr. B is our go-to vet when we don't use our mobile vet. We have had him do tooth extractions on both our kitties (at a very reasonable price) and now he is treating one of our kitties for kidney issues. I cannot speak highly enough of everyone who works at Chico Creek. Everyone is so kind and compassionate, unlike other places where you feel like your sick pet is just a vehicle for the practice to make $$$$. I appreciated that when I called Chico Creek needing a last-minute appointment, they did not tell me to take a hike (I have had this experience in town with my previous vet), but fit my kitty in the following day. Dr. B took the time to explain all of the results in great detail, and he has called me back when I have had questions about the treatment. When I take my pets to Chico Creek, I feel that the staff not only cares about my pets, but also care and understand how much we, the owners, love and worry about them.</Text>

Dr. Bettencourt and his staff are people we can trust with all of our pets care.  They are thorough, but conservative in their approach.  They don't jump right to the most expensive plan of action.  They let you know all your options so that you can choose the plan of action that will fit you, your pet, and families needs.  We have never felt judged by them.</text>

<text>After Forest Animal Hospital cancelled my appointment for my very sick cat, I called every animal hospital in Chico hoping to find someone to see him that day.  Chico Creek was the only one that found time to squeeze him in as every other hospital either wasn't taking new patients or had no same day appointments.  Within 5 minutes of being there they took us in right away.  They were very thorough and caring.  They explained every option I had for my cat and showed what the price of each was so I wasn't blind sided at the end.  I felt no pressure to choose the more expensive options.  We were in and out within an hour.  As soon as I brought my cat home he was feeling better and the vet even called the next morning (on a Saturday) to check in on him.  Hands down best vet experience ever.<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Dr. Bettencourt is a great Vet! He is very knowledgeable professional kind & compassionate.  My animals love him even though he pokes and prods them, cuz he loves animals and they know it. He takes the time to explain everything.
-------------
Dr. Bettencourt, I'm not sure why your records say that you haven't seen my animals in over a year, you examined both of them in November! This is why I had written the original review! Because when I tried to tell the woman that answered the phone that day that you saw both my animals in November, she said you had no record of seeing my animals since 2017!  Then she hung up on me! When I tried to call back to try speak to someone else the same woman would answer the phone. I was literally in tears and I felt my only recourse was to write a scathing review AND hope that you would read it. After I saw that you had responded I called your office again and this time it's a different person who's answering the phone and she was kind professional and extremely helpful. She said she would try to get the problem resolved. I appreciate whatever changes you have made and I'm thankful that you took the time to read your reviews. Thank you so much for all the wonderful work you do with animals.< /Review>

Chico Creek is, in my opinion, the best veterinary office in Chico. They know you by name, they remember almost everything about your fur-child, and they genuinely love seeing you and your pet. My dog gets excited when told she is going to the vet because she loves the staff there that much.<//Text>

Over the past year or so my pets have had several issues, and I have been searching around for a vet that is worth my time. In my experience even some of the highest rated veterinary clinics here in Chico are disorganized and difficult to work with. I've had my charts lost and had my pets get even more sick from the treatment prescribed. That is until I made it into Chico Creek Animal hospital. At Chico Creek the staff is helpful and understanding, the treatments were inexpensive but not cheap, and the doctor is very articulate and helpful. The doctor is very knowledgeable and has been able to provide more than adequate care and advice when needed.I would suggest anyone in the Chico area with pets go here for there veterinary needs</review>

Our first visit was lovely.  Rocky and I were greeted by friendly and prompt staff.  Dr. Bettencourt took into consideration my opinion of the plan of care and had a great bedside manner with Rocky and myself. He also took time and was focused on the task at hand even though I could tell he was very busy that day.  The clinic is clean and bright.  I'm glad I took a chance on Chico Creek Vet.

<Review>I found Chico Creek Animal Hospital Online, I made an appointment for a new puppy check-up. I went for my appointment and I was amazed. The place was very clean and is at an easy access corner right off of Highway 32 / Nord Ave, no hassles of traffic and plenty of parking. The staff was very friendly and helpful with giving me everything I needed to get going on new puppy care. The Veterinarian was very educated and great with my puppy which made me feel warm inside in knowing that I made the right decision on taking my puppy here. In addition the prices were awesome, defiantly not what I am used to paying from other Animal Hospitals. Thanks Chico Creek for be Awesome!<//Review>< user_id>

My first visit to Chico Creek was on an emergency basis. Dr. Bettencourt stayed calm even though I was not. He really listened to my philosophy on the style of care I like for my pets and made suggestions accordingly. The staff was so nice, and I could tell that they love animals by how they interacted with my cat and other pets that came in while I was in the lobby. Olivia was so kind and understanding of me,  that when I wanted to see my kitty before leaving her at the clinic for several hours that Olivia brought my kitty out where I could give her a snuggle before leaving. And if you know cats, they aren't the best patients, but my kitty let Olivia handle her calmly.</Text>

Love Dr. Bettencourt and his staff...  I originally picked their office because it's really close to my house so is easy for before or after work appointments.  I have been happy with each visit.   Most important, my puppy is excited to visit their office every time - even for shots!</Review>

<resp>None<//resp><pics>None</pics><review>I am so impressed with Dr Bettencourt and his entire staff at Chico Creek Animal Hospital. During a recent scare with our cat the staff was amazing. They got us in very quickly. They were compassionate. They were thorough and explained results very well. They were kind even when our cat was being feisty. Dr Bettencourt created a plan for our cats treatment and continued to check in to see how he was doing, making needed adjustments.
We weren’t pressured into any certain kind of treatment. We were given options that were explained clearly. We were given estimates to go along with our options.
The office is very clean and well taken care of. I knew my cat was in good hands. I was most impressed with how many times the doctor or his staff called to check in on how things were going.
I feel like they really care for your animal, even after you pay the bill and leave.
I will definitely continue with Chico Creek Animal Hospital for all my pets needs, now and in the future.
Thank you Dr Bettencourt and thank you to your entire staff.</review><Rating>5<//Rating><gmapID>0x8082df4c95c0492b:0xd65c52ee56c20136</gmapID><user>105539902697822485086</user>< Date>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I had to make the hardest decision any responsible pet owner is faced with. My 18 year old family member kitty cat got to the point where she wasn't showing pain on the outside but was suffering on the inside. Dr. Bettencourt gave me comfort knowing this. From the time I walked into their clinic Melody was so comforting, and professional, that I knew I made the right choice. Melody stayed in the room with me through the procedure. The Doctor was so kind he explained everything that was going to happen.  They allowed me to hold her which was very important to me.  So for what it was thank you Dr Bettencourt and Melody.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< Review>
The dr and staff are so sincere and it’s the first vet I have EVER been to where I didn’t feel pressured to pay for every single thing that was suggested to me. The dr gave me his honest opinions and gave me all options for my dogs surgery. We all love our pets like family but every dollar counts and the dr there really takes that into consideration I felt. Also, the receptionist up front was amazing, when I first called she spent a decent amount of time on the phone with me giving me very helpful information. Other vets were not wanting to even give me a ball part estimate of what the surgery would cost me but she did, and in the end that is what won me over. Glad we found them and happy to say they are our new vet!<//Review>

I was very impressed with everyone! Matt (Dr. Bettencourt) was amazing and very understanding about my concerns.Their follow up was also great.Wendy and the other ladies at the front desk were also wonderful! It is very reassuring to have found a local vet and not be forced to go to a conglomerate animal hospital,which I consider to be the Walmart for our pets.Thank you all and I will definitely spread the word.

<Text>I wish I could give 0 stars for this establishment!! This was my daughter's regular vet. She was moving to Italy and worked with this office for 8 months to make sure she was following the right procedures and filling out all the correct paperwork. Dr. Matthew Bettencourt either did not follow procedure or did not read the paperwork completely, so her dog is not able to travel with her to Italy. Instead of owning to their mistake and working with the USDA to correct their mistake, they tried to blame it on my daughter. Consequently, she has to find boarding for her dog, find someone who can help correct the mistake while she is in Italy, and pay for her pet to travel alone. I am sorely disappointed in their customer service and the lack of compassion they showed to her dog.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x8082df4c95c0492b:0xd65c52ee56c20136<//gmapID></record>

We are new to Chico and were referred to Chico Creek Animal Hospital by a neighbor.  We took our senior dog in for a check up and were immediately made to feel very welcome.  The staff all greeted my husband and I and then introduced themselves to Joey.  Dr. Bettencourt did a thorough exam of Joey, got to know his history and got to know us as a family.  We never felt rushed or unimportant.

We brought with us the medical records of our other two dogs and the staff informed us that they would review the records and notify us of what would be needed to continue their care and send us reminders - we didn't need to be concerned about remembering their well-care appts.

It was a very good experience and I'm sure we will continue our pet children's care with them as long as we are in Chico.</review>

The one star isn't even deserved My dog died!! I usually take my pets to a different vet but they were full and suggested Chico Creek. My 2 yr old Boxer Pitbull had been eating intermittenly for 5 days. I explained I was worried he ate one if his rope toys. When Dr Bettencourt examined him he seemed afraid of my dog. Kept asking me to hold his head, keep his face away from him.  Which is fine, but he should have muzzled him if he was uncomfortable. He did blood work and and xray, which was inconclusive. He gave me meds and many unnecessary items. He told me to take him to Valley Oak Monday for an ultrasound if he wasn't better. I called Valley Oak Monday. They were unable to see him until Wednesday. When Dr Portillo, who is amazing examined him with no fear, my dog jumped and howled in pain. I learned he had a what turned out to be a rope in his belly. As we know, Valley Oak is 2x as expensive so I called Chico Creek and my vet the next day who refused to do the surgery. THANKFULLY Ericksons was able to get him, they were able to see the rope through Xray, and they also caused him to jump in pain when examined.  4 days after surgery my dog passed away from sepsis. If Chico Creek had the proper xray machines necessary to diagnos a large dog and if they had properly examined him my dog may still be alive. BECAUSE of their incompetence I waited too long. I realize he may have died with surgery a week earlier, but the week of having his blood cut off in his stomach caused it to die. If you have a bully breed, avoid them!!!!< /Review>

best vet ive been to in chico! Dr. Bettencort works with you in your budget to find solutions if you dont have endless money to spend. The care is amazing, the staff is wonderful; my daughter is a toddler and she thinks that she should get a sticker because its a doctors office, so the staff actually keeps stickers behind the counter for her. I only have great things to say<//review>

<text>Drove down from Santa Monica to give it a try and was very glad I did. Staff was very friendly and took the time to explain all the options and choices. Choose the Mangolada drink and the Dark Matter cookie dough. Delicious! I'm definitely coming back again<//text>< Pics>

The staff was super friendly and let us try a bunch of different flavors and even let us try two again so we could decide which one we wanted. They also gave us samples of the different teas they have and a tea with coffee. The cookie dough itself was good, but two of us couldn’t even finish it as it was too much after a while.<//review>

Love these guys! Every time I bring my kids in they are so sweet and always mixing things up (in a good way).  Cool to see a bunch of young guys and gals experimenting with business and continuously evolving to improve.  Great product and great little company.<//review>

I love this place! Wonderful people and delicious treats with very unique options. They also have several tasty choices to wet your whistle too. A stand out alternative to satisfy that sweet tooth.< /Review>

Great presentation and service. The cookie dough flavors were really good at first, but they start to taste the same. It's room temperature but I can't help but feel it might taste better cold. Milk is not free, but we got a free cup each at the time. Definitely worth a visit though.</Text>

Staff was really friendly. Definitely an experience and awesome concept. Who doesn't want to sit around and eat actual cookie dough?! Best part, if you don't finish, you can bake the dough and make cookies! Flavor could be a bit stronger, but it's delish nonetheless.< /Review>

I tried the snickerdoodle cookie dough and it was okay, a bit on the dry side though. I bet it would be much better with the ice cream on top but unfortunately the ice cream machine was out of service when i visited.< /Text>< pics>

<review>The cookie dough is really good ( we had the Galaxy). The service was great. We split the cookie dough three ways and it was plenty (with the ice cream). Kinda expensive at 4.50 for a small but cheaper than similar places. I recprecomyou get ice cream with it because it is really dry without it.</review><pics>None<//pics>< time>

<text>The flavor was OK (I got unicorn sugar cookie) but the texture is hardly what I would liken to cookie dough. I feel like the grit of the coarse sugar is a key in getting the texture of cookie dough right, and the smoothness (minus the added texture of sprinkles and mini white chocolate chips) was not a good mouth feel. The other flavors I sampled (minus the gluten free PB flavor) had the same texture too. All I can compare it to is a solid mousse 🙁

I wanted the scoop as half baked cookie, and the guy serving me said it came with ice cream, which I didn't want. I asked if there was a way to substitute extra extra cookie dough (whatever amount would be the same cost as the subtracted ice cream scoop) and the kid was just apathetic and said it couldn't be done.

I've been eyeing this place for months when I saw them on my Instagram and I just had such a....underwhelming experience. 😔</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dd27349f800d97:0x906700de60e8f45c<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I have only been here once but I enjoyed it.  I need to visit a second time to make my mind up about this interesting and abstract dessert.

I got the chocolate and the nutella.  Good combination, but the nutella was gluten free so it was a little rough and difficult to scoop -- but it still tasted good!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I found a hair in my drink and try to reach out to the owner but they never call me back. It was disgusting. I don’t think I will be coming back.  And it does not look like advertising pictures. There are no mango bits.<//text>

But maybe I'm old school, but I would rather just go get traditional of cream instead.<//Review>

<text>Came to Valencia to check out some cribs and things at buy buy baby. After, my family wanted to go and eat and we searched what was near by and we found this place.
We got here an hour before they close and they attended us with such a great attitude. We got nothing but the best hospitality here.
Their food is really good and tasty. The spicy pork was more on the sweet side than the spicy side but it was still good. The kimchi tofu soup was really good with such great flavors.
This is a must try if you are in the area and are looking for Korean food or something different.
Great service. Great food.<//text>< pics>

<review>I didn't get the main dish, there was two of us and it was just too damn large.  We each got individual beef rib stews, one spicy, one not, and they were both so fresh, light and incredibly flavorful.  The staff was very good, and helpful.

We like a lot eating out. Yesterday we  found this excellent restaurant which we didn’t know before. We had a delightful time there with great meal and a professional crew and a great chief cook. We put this venue in our list  and we shall surely return very soon. We warmly recommend.< /text>

Very tasty food. Extremely friendly staff. The parking lot is a bit cramped, but they're never completely full. Overall great experience on a night I had to be dragged out on. Would definitely eat here again, especially when I want spicy, because it was very tasty, above the spice. Cheers!< /Text>

Oh my gosh! This place is AMAZING! The costumer service here is out of this world. Truly. I don’t think I have ever been to a restaurant with this kind of hospitality. Jennifer, Veronica, and Jeffrey were the people that helped us. Can’t say enough good things!</Review>

Super good legit Korean food.  You know its authentic when you got an angry Korean lady bossing you around on how to order and limited refills to get on dishes.  Pricey, but honestly all Korean food is pricey, especially in California.< /Review>

Very nice staff, and I loved that they kept refilling the panchan! However both our soups were bland and one was missing some elements from the description & picture.< /Review>

If you love spicy, u gotta try their spicy rice cakes! Best I ever had. And I think they own the pho place next door too so when u want to order something from there, u can too! Or vice versa 👍< /text>

<text>Three of us stopped by for an early dinner and ordered the beef spicy tofu soup, spicy beef vermicelli (glass noodle) soup and a barbecue beef/ spicy tofu soup combo. Several small side dishes were served with this: sweet pickled cucumbers, pickled daikon, bean sprouts, fish cake and kimchi. Everything was quite tasty and well seasoned but we especially liked the tofu soups!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

Ordered via postmates: beef tofu soup, kimchi fried rice. Very impressed at the quality of food. Huge portion siZes as well as with all of the side “banchans” they include at no charge. Looks like I won’t need to go down to the valley for my kfood fix anymore</Review>

Went to The Chocolate Bar for the firt time, I fell in love with it, music was soothing,  took me back to when I was a child in my grandparents house. Ordered a few items and everything was delicious,  brownie wasn't too sweet, chocolate abuelita was just right. Will definitely be going back to try out more!!! Thank you for your kind service, great personality!! Very welcoming !!</Review>

Found this hidden gem a family owned business The Chocolate Bar.  Ordered a carrot cake, the chocolate chip brownie, the fruit tart. Wow! delicious! They also have cheesecake and cake and other pastries. If you like  dried fruits, and nuts they carry those too! And many other things. Definitely worth checking out. Looking forward to trying there Crepes they're only $4.99 on Wednesday.<//Text>

Wide variety of treats and snacks.  I tried the cheesecake and was kicking myself after I ordered for not getting a topping for it.  Honestly the cheesecake is so good it doesn't need a topping.

Definitely will visit again when I'm in the area.< /Text>

<Text>Extremely delicious!!!!! 🤤🤤🤤
It’s a little pricey but it’s completely worth it...
we got the chocolate cake,
Chocolate gelato,
Mango gelato,
And chocolate chip cookies...
this place is perfect for desserts,
Extremely clean, customer service is on point... the guy there was extremely nice to my son... 😊
The best part are the chocolate chip cookies, they’re big, recently baked, the chocolate completely melts on your mouth.
5 out of 5 star service... ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
Will be going back again,
Favorite new spot for dessert... 🍪🍫< /Text>< pictures>

Just opened 6 months ago the Chocolate Bar (a family owned Business) is a must go. They have gelato, all kinds of specialty cakes, coffees, Mexican coffee, Cafe de la olla, Bindi Dessert's, home made sandwiches and a lot more. Plenty of seating inside, Beautiful tables and wonderful decorations throughout.< /Review>

<Review>There is bound to be a treat for you.  The chocolate comes in numerous styles.  My friends and I couldn't decide, so we were offered samples of not only the treats, but the ice cream that accompanied them.  I believe we made the right combination.  There is also  "café de hoya," which will make any Mexican customer feel right at home.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgXqwsGLLqbslwE8wTmwu6B-8Ubdq7xHcvawr1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMx1txI5a9DHOIkpj3N6cekKMMKECRwJDjaDb9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Great unique place to just have a date or relax. Went on a date with my husband only to have the best cheese cake of my life and a Mexican French fusión crepe. Overall a personable and flavorful experience. We stayed for a couple of hours and decompressed with coffee sandwiches crepes and cheese cake.</text>

<review>This was our second visit and it was just as good as the first. We each had a martini and decided the Chocolate Covered Pretzel is the best! We had lunch, half sandwich and French onion soup (so good), and finished with a free dessert of warm chocolate in a martini glass with fresh strawberries to dip (from a free birthday dessert offer they sent me in a text). Honestly, this place is worth the visit. Great service, delicious food, and a great theme of chocolate throughout.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This place is incredible! We loved the coffee and the authentic Mexican hot chocolate and the mouth watering desserts! The ambiance was very comforting too and the beautiful Spanish music being played took me back home to some very nice memories! The nice couple that tended to us made us feel like we were special guests in their home! Can't wait to go back again over and over!!!</text>

This place instantly warmed me up once I stepped inside. The aroma of the fresh cafe de olla brings me back to my childhood in mexico, spending time in mi Abuela's kitchen. The cafe is PERFECTLY made (it's rare for me to not add anything to my coffee). Their pastries are as delicious as they look. The crepes recipe is on point! Plus they have their candies packaged for purchase! The family running this cafe is doing great things with their business and I thank them for the great foods with even greater service 🤗
The mood this Chocolate Bar sets makes it comfortable for casual brunches, friends and family, cute dates and even when you're by yourself 🙋🏽
Please take the time to visit El Bar de Chocolaté 🍫 your life may just get a little sweeter!< /review>

Family owned, amazing service, delicious cafe de olla and one perfect crepe! The menu has just about any craving you could have and the cafe de olla is the real thing. Pasteries, cookies, mousses, nuts, gelato, coffee, hot chocolate, you name it. Perfect to stop in for a treat or adorable place to sit down and enjoy with someone.< /review>

The service was great as soon as I walked in the door, and based on the quality the prices are way better than I expected. Plus the store smells amazing... if they bottled that scent up as an air freshener I would buy it for every room in my house!< /Text>

Owner is very hospitable. We tried their gelatos which were delicious. They’re Cafe de Holla was amazing! It’s dark sweet cinnamon coffee, with no cream or milk, and it doesn’t need it because it is so yummy! I’d prefer to go here than my delight cupcakes across the shopping center. There’s plenty of seating areas to enjoy a delicious crepé. The music gave us a very relaxing vibe.< /review>

This is place is great. They have delicious Italian desserts  and a nice variety to choose from. The desserts are a bit pricey, and the place can use more lighting.But they are new and tucked in the shopping mall, so if you're interest you should go and try it to help the business out and try their amazing choices.< /text>

<Text>Owner was really awesome, very nice. They just opened and didn't have a lot of customers when I walked in. He gave me a cupcake while I waited for my coffee (which was only $2.95 btw) then after I payed handed me 3 scoops of sorbet! It was all really good, and I'm headed back even if they don't give anything away next time</Text><user>103403046047869132195<//user>< user_name>

<rate>5</rate><Review>There is bound to be a treat for you.  The chocolate comes in numerous styles.  My friends and I couldn't decide, so we were offered samples of not only the treats, but the ice cream that accompanied them.  I believe we made the right combination.  There is also  "café de hoya," which will make any Mexican customer feel right at home. I came with my friend looking for tiramisu, ended up with a torta, 2 delicious crepes, 4 tiramisu,macaroon and some asorteas nuts. The torta was fresh, amazing, and plated beautifully. The crepes were made fresh to order and delicious. The macaroons were soft and fresh. This place is a must go-to for sure. everything is delicious and fresh. 100% recommend< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1576893902619, 'text': 'Jermayne,  wow!

<Text>I came with my wife looking for tiramisu, ended up with a torta, 2 delicious crepes, 4 tiramisu,macaroon and some asorteas nuts. The torta was fresh, amazing, and plated beautifully. The crepes were made fresh to order and delicious. The macaroons were soft and fresh. This place is a must go-to for sure. everything is delicious and fresh. 100% recommend< /Text>< pictures>

Little hole in the wall that served us great boba for even better prices. If you don’t feel like spending $16 at the gentrified trendy places I would recommend this. The service has been nice although maybe a little understaffed. I’m excited to try their food!< /review>

<Text>Sooooo good! My family stopped in while waiting for our Chinese take out across the street.  We decide to try this place since we love tapioca drinks. We ordered a Taro slush and Lychee green tea which were delicious!!!My husband said it was the best Taro slush he's had as of yet. The popping topping for the drinks are fun and yummy and the service is wonderful! I wish I had known about this place sooner. We found our neighborhood go to spot.<//Text>< Date>

< review>
My go to favorite San Bruno Avenue tea house was unexpectedly closed 😱 so I decided to try a neighboring tea house Tea Plus! Firstly, their happy hour special is a few cents cheaper than my fav place which was a instant plus in these penny pinching pandemic times! I ordered a Passion Fruit Slushy with a combination of passion fruit jellies and bobas and while not as photogenic as my favorite drink it was absolutely delish, I was munching on jellies and bobas for awhile after the drink was finished so it's safe to say the ordering of the extra combo probably was overkill. The one truly wonderful part of my visit to Tea Plus was the customer service. The older gentleman that was supervising a younger worker took over as I think my add-ons were a bit complicated to the check out app they used and he was friendly and knowledgeable and made me feel very welcome I felt that my drink choice was in truly good hands. Customer service is a rarity around SF at most times so when it is provided I'm always apppreciative! The cons would be that the ambiance is lacking and the drinks again aren't very photogenic but the pros heavily outweigh these small cons. Five star customer service and a yummy in my tummy afternoon drink! Thank you Tea Plus I will be visiting again for sure and now I have two very favorite San Bruno Avenue Tea Houses for my special treats! I think next time I'll be trying the crepes as well or maybe even the spam hand roll! *** Major plus I didn't pay an upcharge for my jelly boba combos!</review>

<Review>I've been to Tea Plus 3 times so far.
I usually go to 5° a couple doors down.  Tea Plus's special price is a bit cheaper & they are now offering a discount for students with a student ID therefore most of the customers are teenagers.
They seem to have slow service even when they aren't busy.
1st times when they first opened, their bubbles were too hard, chewy & the tea was not strong enough & a bit too sweet.  2nd time, about 1 month ago the bubbles were better.  3rd time, the lychee popping bubbles were wrinkly.  I tried to order other food items couple of times but it seems like they are always out or it won't be ready for some time so I've never ordered food from them.  Also, the store is smaller & have less seating compared to 5°.  The guy who works there who I think is the owner looks like he just woke up.  His hair is always a mess & he looks exhausted.
He looks like he needs a haircut, shower & some good sleep.< /Review>< Pictures>

Stay away from this place. We waited 50 minutes for our drinks for them to tell us they didn't have the ingredients to make our drink. I've never experienced such terrible service.< /review>

Pretty decent BoBo tea place with a selection of snacky food also served,
The decor is brightly done up and decidedlt cheerful, however the speed of the food coming out does seem to take a while to come out, not the staff's fault but they could probably do with having an extra staff during the lunch and afterwork period.
Owner claimed to have the best Curry Fishballs in SF or our money back, so decided to try them, however the portion size is small for the price of around 4 bucks and while decent, hardly spectacular as per the claims.</Review>

<Text>One blustery evening, my boo and I were exploring the streets of San Francisco. It was super late and many eateries were closing, but one little place caught our eye. Never having been there before, we decided to pop in to Tea Plus for a quick refreshing bubbly drink. They had a really extensive menu and many available toppings as well as customized ice and sweetness preferences. I ordered the chocolate coconut milk Boba drink. The drink was sweeter than pie and creamier than hell. The tapioca Boba added a nice chewy, starchy bite that hit the spot just right. Although the taste was lit AF and quenched a thirst deep within, the service was a bit odd and we had to wait around 20 minutes for a drink. We asked the server how he was doing and he responded with a phrase including a few casual obscenities, which I personally didn't mind but a straight laced professional might to take offense to such lingo. But due to the drink quality and taste, we returned twice and got the Oreo Milk Tea with Boba tapioca. Honestly best drink I've ever had, hunty. Go for the taste, service is a crapshoot and you might have to wait but boo it's worth it! SLAY QUEENS honestly you slay my LIFE< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Disgusting milk tea...sour...was not a fruit flavored drink...when asked to exchange for something else the cashier said no. Horrible service. Food was nothing to rave about. Disappointing.< /Text>

<Text>Dont usually post reviews but i Love this place!! The owners go pick out fruit early in the mornings before opening, so fruit and veggies are always fresh!! And they are extremely nice. And they also make party trays for events or occasions. Prices are good as well!
Definitely recommend to go check this place out< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>Fresh, made to order mexican snacks. We had fresas con crema (fresh strawberries & cream - yogurt/condensed milk mixture) and a Bionico (fresh fruit salad with the same mixture from the strawberries and cream, granola, raisins and fresh shredded coconut) Service was fast, friendly and moderately priced. I'll be returning to try some of their fresh pressed juice mixtures, they have energy boosters, high blood pressure mixtures, fat burners, weight loss and many more.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Ive spend 200 one year and another  200 just to give them a chance because I though maybe I didn’t move fast enough to look at all the house but
The worst part they took forever to answer it was the worst experience
I’ve tried telling them that I paid 200 in the past
now another 200 IN TOTAL 400 and I didn’t get helped they ignored me and I got no txt back it was the worst
Now I know why they tell you to pay 200 dollar for just a list and credit check when every were else you check the house first and then they run your credit
They want your money first before you even check house</Text>

<Review>I am very happy with my experience at Mi Casita rentals. Salvador was very kind and receptive to my needs and so was his wife Yelen. I had an emergency situation and they took care of me and my family like if we were their family. They took the time to listen and they also worked hard to find me something quickly. I am very happy I chose them and I would definitely use their services again. They do all the work for you so you can take care of other things. I will recommend them to anyone I know.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Time>

Came here frustrated after looking on my own for a place to rent with no luck in finding what I was looking for, so Glad I came here, we paid $100 and every Wednesday and Friday they'll send us a list of properties available, If we liked something we let them know and they'll do all the work, finally after a month and a half we found a home perfect for us. What I liked about this the most is that you are paying for them to check your credit ONCE, no matter how many houses you like and you want them to file for, so that's a BIG PLUS!!!

Very professional and very friendly staff. We worked with mi casita for a little over 2 months to get into a house. It took some time but she did not give up and was consistently submitting applications to houses for us. We finally got approved for one and she met us at the house and gave us a tour. Finalized all the paperwork and moved in. Great overall experience. Thanks so much for devoting much time and effort to helping us find a house< /Review>

When my brother got diagnosed with cancer and started going through chemo, we decided we needed a house. After looking around and realizing every house would take credit reports, background checks, and fees we got discouraged. My son in law somehow found mi casita.
We hired mi casita and Yelen was our contact/realtor. After paying the initial fees I looked on yelp and got pretty nervous. But after turning in our paperwork, and sending Yelen the houses we where interested in.....she had us in a house in less than 2 weeks. The amount of paperwork it takes to rent now is overwhelming, but she got us through it, and now we are able to help my brother through his chemo treatments. We are very happy with mi casita, and the service we received from Yelen.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1568657922031, 'text': 'DEAR BLESSING FAMILY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR REVIEW, THESE ARE THE KIND OF REVIEWS THAT GIVE US THE JOY OF CONTINUING TO HELP MORE FAMILIES FIND THEIR HOME EVERY DAY...

<review>They charge a initial fee to help you plus other charges on top. Just way too much money to find a place to live. Companies like this prey on ppls hardships.<//review>< Rating>

<Review>Mi Casita Rentals is a great place for people who are looking for houses to rent. They helped me find a house in a short period of time, when i really needed it. Yelem Maravilla is a excellent agent. She asks what you need a then does everything she can to get you exactly what you asked for.
This was our second time using Mi Casita Rentals. Yelem found us a house fast a couple years ago when we moved from up north. She did an amazing job then and really came through again this second time.
I will definitely use Mi Casita Rentals again the next time I need to find a house and I will recommend Mi Casita Rentals to my freinds and family.< /Review><Date>1501352588965</Date><Response>{'time': 1501533000490, 'text': '(Translated by Google) THANKS EMILIA POLISHED FOR TRUSTING IN MY HOUSE AGAIN, YOU MAKE MY BABY THIS STAND FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS, OUR GREATEST SATISFACTION IS TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM.

(Translated by Google) Terrible service!
I do not recommend this place at all, they only sent us the requirements and from there we never had an answer, they sent them messages and they never answered.
We got a house faster on our part without as many requirements as they made it seem. They just made excuses for not doing their job.
Waste of time and money

(Original)
Pésimo servicio!
No recomiendo este lugar para nada solo nos hicieron llegar los requisitos y de ahí jamás tuvimos una respuesta les mandaba mensajes y jamás contestaban.
Conseguimos más rápido una casa por nuestra parte sin tantos requisitos como ellos lo hacían ver. Solo ponían pretextos para no hacer su trabajo.

(Translated by Google) Today I went with my son and my daughter-in-law to see if they could help us find a house, the man who was there treated us badly, he was rude to me because he was upset when I told him what possibility my son had that they would take away a house. bad because I asked him why he charged so expensive 200 for filling out the application I asked him questions that neither daughter-in-law did not understand him and he answered me wrongly he told me that he did not want to talk to me and his courage was when I asked why so much money was charged when if not He was giving me the answers that we laugh at, it was very rude, he does not help you, they only want the money, he told me that next time he would not answer my call, they only want your money, you mark them, they never answer, they only send you a message, I speak badly and no. He apologized

(Translated by Google) Wow thank you MI CASITA RENTALS if I could give you more than 5 stars I would give them, with them you pay applications like in any other place, I paid IN OTHER PLACES more than $ 400 in applications paying $ 35-50 for each house that applied and each time I applied They ran my credit and that affected my score, IN MICASITA RENTALS, I only paid the application for all the adults that we applied and I only RUN THE CREDIT ONCE, and I applied in more than 10 properties and after two weeks I rent !! They do not decide, logically, they are not the owners, but they DO work on your application, following up until they approve you, if you are constant and send properties to submit your application if you rent! Of course, the decision is made by the owners based on your credit and income but that you only pay once the applications and they run the credit only once in BIG PLUS regardless of whether they approve you or not, that will save you a lot of money paying only once !!
But I rent WITH MY CASITA and I am very grateful! I recommend them 💯

Wow gracias MI CASITA RENTALS si pudiera darles más de 5 estrellas se las daría , con ellos pagas aplicaciones como en cualquier otro lugar, yo pague EN OTROS LUGARES más de $400 en aplicaciones pagando $35-50 por cada casa que aplicara y cada  vez que aplicaba me corrían el crédito y eso me afectaba el puntúaje, EN MICASITA RENTALS , solo pague la aplicación para todos los adultos que aplicamos y solo ME CORRIERON EL CREDITO UNA VEZ , y apliqué en más de 10 propiedades y a las dos semanas rente !! Ellos no deciden lógico no son los dueños pero SI trabajan tu aplicación dándole seguimiento hasta que te aprueben , si eres constante y mandas propiedades para que sometan tu aplicación si rentas ! Claro que la Decision  la Toman los dueños basado en tu crédito y ingreso pero que solo pagues una vez las aplicaciones y te corran el crédito solo una vez en BIG PLUS independientemente te aprueben o no ya eso te ahorrará mucho dinero pagando solo una vez !!
Pero yo rente CON MI CASITA y esto muy agradecida  ! Los recomiendo 💯</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I THINK PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A RENTAL APPLICATION WORKS ... FOR ME MY CASITA RENTALS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE SINCE I SPENT MORE THAN $ 500 ON APPLICATIONS, WE ARE 4 OF THE FAMILY ADULTS AND FOR EACH HOUSE THAT APPLIED ME THEY CHARGED $ 45 AND THE WORST MY CREDIT DROPPED EVERY TIME THEY DROPPED IT, IN MY HOUSE I ONLY PAYED ONCE FOR THE APPLICATIONS ONLY ONCE THEY RUN THE CREDIT AND RENT IN TWO WEEKS, THEY DID NOT STOP SUBMITTING MY APPLICATION IN SEVERAL HOUSES THEY APPROVED ME IN A LATER THEY SHOWED IT TO ME INSIDE AND I LIKED IT THE FOLLOWING DAY I SIGNED THE RENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE OWNER .. PLEASE BEFORE PUTTING A BAD COMMENT, TRY TO ARRANGE YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH THEM THAT I AM SURE, THEY ARE MORE THAN TO DISPOSE OF. .. THEY WORKED MY APPLICATION AND THE OWNER PAYED THEM UNTIL AFTER SIGNING THE CONTRACT, THEREFORE, THEY CONVENIED THAT WE RENT BECAUSE IF THEY DO NOT WIN, VERIFYING AN APPLICATION WITH REFERENCES, EMPLOYMENT, INCOME HISTORY IF IT REQUIRES TIME AND DEDICATION AND THEY PAY FOR THAT WORK ... IT IS AN HONEST SERVICE AND IF THEY PUT THEIR EFFORT ... YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE NOT OWNERS AND THAT IF THEY DON'T APPROVE US, IT IS BECAUSE WE DON'T RATE LIKE ANY OTHER PLACE ... IN ADVANCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY CASITA RENTLAS YA SALVADOR FOR YOUR EFFORT AND BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS IN CONTACT WITH ME DURING THE PROCESS .. I RECOMMEND YOU 100%

PIENSO QUE LAS PERSONAS NO ENTIENDEN COMO SE TRABAJA UNA APLICACION DE RENTA... PARA MI MI CASITA RENTALS SON MUY EFECTIVOS YA QUE YO ANTES DE IR CON ELLOS GASTE MAS DE $500 EN APLICACIONES SOMOS 4 DE FAMILA ADULTOS Y POR CADA CASA QUE APLICABA ME COBRABAN $45 Y LO PEOR MI CREDITO BAJABA CADA VEZ QUE ME LO CORRIAN, EN MI CASITA SOLO PAGUE UNA VEZ POR LAS APLICACIONES SOLAMENTE UNA VEZ ME CORRIERON EL CREDITO Y RENTE EN DOS SEMANAS, ELLOS NO DEJARON  DE SOMETER MI APLICAION EN VARIAS CASAS HASTA QUE ME APROBARON EN UNA DESPUES ME LA MOSTRARON POR DENTRO Y ME GUSTO AL DIA SIGUENTE FIRME EL CONTRATO DE RENTA CON EL DUENO.. POR FAVOR ANTES DE PONER UN MAL COMENTARIO TRATEN DE ARREGLAR SU CITUACION CON ELLOS QUE ESTOY SEGURO ESTAN MAS QUE DISPUESTOS A AYUDARLE.. ELLOS TRABAJARON MI APLICAICON Y EL DUENO LES PAGO HASTA DESPUES DE FIRMAR EL CONTRATO , POR LOGICA A ELLOS LES CONVIENE QUE RENTEMOS POR QUE SI NO ELLOS NO GANAN, EL VERIFICAR UNA APLICAICON REFERENCIAS, EMPLEO , HISTORIAL DE RENTAS REQUIERE TIEMPO Y DEDICACION Y ELLS PAGAN POR ESE TRABAJO ... ES UN SERVICIO HONESTO Y SI PONEN SU ESFUERZO ... HAY QUE ENTENDER QUE ELLOS NO SON LOS DUENOS Y QUE SI NO NOS APRUEBAN ES POR QUE NO CALIFICAMOS COMO EN CUALQUIER OTRO LUGAR... DE ANTE MANO MUCHAS GRACIAS MI CASITA RENTLAS Y A SALVADOR POR SU ESFUERZO Y POR QUE SIEMPRE ESTUBO EN CONTACTO CONMIGO DURANTE EL PROCESO .. LOS RECOMIENDO 100%</Text><Rate>5</Rate>< time>

(Translated by Google) The worst service !! Do not go to this place I do not recommend them at all, they do nothing but take the money that is $ 200 dollars to send you emails with lists of houses so that you can do your “homework” and send them the ones you like and do not They get nothing. And apart they charge you $ 15 dollars per person to run your credit! Pure waste of time and spent more than 2 months and did NOTHING! Now not even my calls answer! I hired another person and he got me a house in 3dias!

El peor servicio!! No vallan a este lugar no se los recomiendo en lo absoluto, no hacen más que sacarte el dinero que son $200 dólares por mandarte correos electrónicos con listas de casas para que tu agas tu “tarea” y les mandes las que te gustan y no te consiguen nada. Y aparte te cobran $15 dólares por persona para correr tu crédito! Pura pérdida de tiempo ya pasaron más de 2 meses y no hicieron NADA! Ahora ni mis llamadas contestan! Contrate a otra persona y me consiguio  casa en 3dias!< /review>

(Translated by Google) Do not be fooled by these unscrupulous thieves. At first they promise you that they will help you get a house for rent and they will charge you money for an application, and then for credit and more fees and I trusted them.
All they are able to do is give you a list of houses twice a week and you have to take care of asking for it because if not, they don't give you anything. Then they tell you to choose which houses you like and that they can't take you to see it until they submit your application. Then tell you that they could not qualify you. There are many irregularities in that company. I have almost 1 month to pay them to help me find a house to rent and they have done absolutely NOTHING !!! They are thieves and liars !!!

(Original)
No se dejen engañar por estos ladrones sin escrúpulos. Al principio te prometen que van a ayudarte a conseguir rentar una casa y te cobran dinero para una aplicación, y luego para el crédito y más cuotas y yo confié en ellos.
Lo único que son capaces de hacer es darte una lista de casas dos veces por semana y tú tienes que encargarte de pedirla porque si no, no te dan nada. Luego te dicen que elijas que casas te gustan y que ellos no pueden llevarte a verla hasta que sometan tu aplicación. Para después decirte que no te pudieron calificar. Hay muchísimas irregularidades en esa compañía. Tengo casi 1 mes que les pague para que me ayuden a encontrar una casa para rentar y no han hecho absolutamente NADA!!! Son unos ladrones y mentirosos!!!</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) happy with this company, please before going to a place first verify who they are, I was a victim of fraud and did not trust, but I had to rent and there are no direct owners, now everything is through offices, where you have to pay for the credit report and applications for each adult as $ 50 for a single house ... but I found MI CASITA RENTALS Thank God they have good reviews, and more than 15 years in the business, and they help you with a small fee and only paying the application and the credit report one time no matter how many houses you want to apply until an owner approves you .. I recommend 100 do not stop putting your application until you rent a house, they gave me back my hope and in less than two weeks rent my house. We are grateful, Salvador and Yelen, for your efficient and professional work ...

(Original)
contento con esta compania, por favor antes de ir a un lugar primero verifiquen quienes son, yo fui victima de fraude y no confiaba, pero tenia que rentar y duenos directos no hay, ahora todo es por medio de oficinas, donde tienes que pagar por el reporte de credito y aplicaciones por cada adulto como $50 para una sola casa... pero encontre a MI CASITA RENTALS gracia a Dios ellos tienes buenos reviews, y mas de 15 anos en el negocio, y te ayudan con un pequeno fee y solo pagando la aplicacion y el reporte de credito una sola vez no importa cuantas casas quieras aplicar hasta que un dueno te apruebe.. los recomendo 100 no dejan de meter tu aplicacion hasta que rentes una casa, ellos me devolvieron la esperanza y en menos de dos semanas rente mi casa. estamos agradecidos gracias Salvador y Yelen por su trabajo eficiente y profecional...<//text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Look at the bad comments and they are very clear that they give you lists and I look for the ones of my price that I can pay and bedrooms that I need and the area that I wanted several I went to see them to see the neighborhood in which the house was and the one I liked I spoke to Mrs. Yelen and she put our application and thank God the owners accepted it for me a year and a half ago but I had to leave because the owners put it up for sale and on time I returned with Mrs. Yelen and she helped us again she got us another house and we are very happy with your services do not want to get the house and move the furniture please you also have to do your part to get your house and if you do not accept their applications the owners for something will be or your credit not good

Mire los malos comentarios y están mal claro que te dan listas yo busque las de mi precio que puedo pagar y recámaras que necesite y la área que quería varias fui a verlas para ver el barrio en el que estaba la casa y la que me gustaba le hablaba a la señora yelen y ella metía nuestra aplicación y gracias a Dios los dueños me la aceptaron una ase año y medio pero me tuve que salir porque la pusieron en venta los dueños y a hora volví con la señora yelen y nos volvió a ayudar nos consiguió otra casa y estamos muy contentos con su servicios no quieran que les consiga la casa y les mueva los muebles por favor ustedes también tienen que poner de su parte para conseguir su casa y si no les aceptan sus aplicaciones los dueños por algo será o su crédito no es bueno< /Text>

After driving for two weeks and looking for a house, I arrived at this office with a lot of distrust because I had already been robbed of a rent office with $ 200 and told me to stop a list of houses and went to the first of the list and when I went to the place I was renting that the owners of that house told me that they were not renting it, whoever told me that would explain how and where and they got upset. Now imagine that I still paid $ 200 to help me. I arrived at my little house and they helped me with a kind rapides they help you 100% without lies. I am going to tell you about my situation. I was in a hotel room with my children and my husband, a disabled son with brain injury who had to change honeycomb probes to move him every 35 min from side to side in bed in a small place and look and search and my house helped me with a rapids in finding my house in 5 days in which I am already thanks to our guardian angel and a lady. Wonders that helped us be a normal family again. Thanks My Little House.

(Translated by Google) Hi, well, I already read previous comments and some good and some bad, well, I'll say mine. That is what counts. I was looking for a house before arriving at my house. I went to another place in San Bernardino and there were 400 dollars scammed. And they did not give me a list and here they were really 100 and they gave me a list and every week they left. 2 lists with current houses until I chose the one I was looking for and nowadays I can say that I am fine because if I didiron their work they got me my house. I like all good service. Thank you. and life is not bitter, everyone speaks as he did at the fair in Buenos Aires badly and take good care ... bye.

Hola bueno pues ya leei  comentarios anteriores y algunos buenos y algunos malos bueno yo dire el mio.

Me agrado todo buen servicio.  gracias. y no se amargen la  vida cada quien habla como le ba en la feria portense mal y cuidense bien.. bye.</Text>

The service is to be able to represent them by sending their application to all the houses that they ask us regardless of the time and how many they are, my little house is not responsible for the clients not qualifying but even if we always look for a way to help them by giving them different options, and we do not stop until Let them rent, if you decided to look elsewhere or not to continue is an individual decision, in advance we ask you for a dsculapa for having made you feel that way, remember that in my casita rentals we value each of our clients and we do everything that is in our power to have more satisfied customers every day, because our goal is to convert our customers into future buyers.\nsincerely\n\n(Original)\nbunas tardes Javier  y Hector ya que ustedes dos son una sola aplicacion, leyendo sus reviews lamento escuchar que sientan que mi casita rentals los estafo, mirando su expediente ustedes no tenian el mejor de los creditos y no reunian con las calificaciones y requisistos de los duenos, pero aun asi los enviamos con un dueno directo que ano tras ano les ha rentado a nuestros clientes con problemas crediticios, el senor jose en rialto ca y ustedes lo recuerdan bien, el los haceptaba y les rentaba pero ustedes rechazaron  y no quisieron la propiedad, yo yelen aun asi les ofreci seguir ayudandoles somentiendos su aplicacion y buscandoles otro dueno que los haceptara, siempre estube en contacto con ustedes, mi casita rentals no promete rentarles. el servicio es poder representarlos mandando su aplicacion a todas las casas que nos pidan sin importar el tiempo y cuantas sean,  mi casita no es responsable que los clientes no califiquen pero aun si siempre buscamos la manera de ayudarles dandoles diferentes opciones, y no paramos hasta que renten, si ustedes decidieron  buscar por otro lado o no seguir es decision individual, de antemano le pedimos una dsculapa por haberlos hecho sentir de esa manera, recuerde que en mi casita rentals valoramos a cada uno de nuestros clientes y hacemos todo lo que esta en nuestro poder para cada dia tener mas clientes satisfechos, por que nuestro objetivo es convertir a nuestros clientes en futuros compradores.\nsinceramente'}< /Response>
<review>(Translated by Google) They are licensed thieves, according to them they say they will find a place they appear to be very professional and they only steal your money, apart they charge credit and application apart from 100 dlls, which is only to give you a list of places that they do not even have available , don't spend your money crailist was more effective and free ..

(Original)
Son unos ladrones con licensia, segun ellos dicen que te van a encontrar lugar aparentan ser muy profesionales y solo te roban tu dinero, aparte cobran credito y aplicacion aparte de 100 dlls, que solo es para darte una lista de lugares que ellos nisiquiera tienen disponibles, no gasten su dinero crailist fue mas efectivo y gratis..</review><rating>1<//rating></record>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Store is a mess😩.

They hired a bunch of high school kids that don’t care.  Or not trained enough.  They Mis-stocked items in the stationary and small appliances.  High school kids can’t be bothered if you are looking for a specific item.  Cashier was rude when I said the luggage was a sale price item.  Customer service was clueless about the sale item.  Walmart is better than this Target store.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPem_7fy_ynL_bWKU0sl-QdU0ItRW67q4HeMyDE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCjDlv5BC_c_nlTQkuLyjuGSfd9JriEUuU_z-J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYX5vNz4y5qTdvJt5lgOysGiD4fy7jCFTSdAZC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I bought an Apple Watch from this target & there wasn't a watch in the box, now that I'm reaching out explaining the situation they are giving me the run around and refusing to help me. Anne with HR was very rude and so was multiple employees that I've been dealing with. The only helpful person in the whole store is Fernando with ETL. If you're buying a pricier item like an Apple Watch, just go directly through the company (Apple) and NOT Target, they do not want to take ownership of the missing watch and as of right now, I'm out $215 and now some thief has a new watch.<//Review>< user_name>

The amazing customer service at this location has always brought me back, time and again. Lately their stock hasn't been the best, and I understand there's issues with shipping and whatnot, but the woman at the service counter was just as sweet as could be, so helpful, and so patient - not just with me but with her funky computer!</review>

This Target is one of the worst at changing their prices for the new week. Beware if you shop here on Sunday morning. It has happened sooo many times that I go to the cash register to purchase items that are “on sale” only not to get the deal that is advertised on the shelves. The cashiers all pretty much say the same thing- we just haven’t gotten around to it yet. Yesterday I bought two items to get the 5$ gift card and when I got home I realized I didn’t get the card. I checked my receipt and then checked the prices online... and, what a surprise, prices were wrong again.
You never know if when it says sale... it’s actually really on sale.
They also forget to mark items up before putting the “sale” sticker on. Which is just ridiculous. I saw an item that had a regular price of 9.59 and had a sale sticker right under it for 10.44!! I guess you just have to wait for some items to stop being on sale if you wanna really save money.<//text>

I just recently found out target helps the consumer by providing the best deals with in store sales, gift cards and circle app, and accepting mfg coupons. This is very valuable since I have been sick and trying to get on disability and my husband is also disabled. Also the red card. Because of these saving and great products I will recommend target to all friends!</review>

This target has one of the best Starbucks I’ve been to. This Starbucks truly cares about you and I always get my beverage before my payment is processed! Wow fast service great staff. Clean area and cups are ALWYAS SO FULL AND STOCKED. Love it here best Starbucks ever. I could go on and on. But these baristas now my drink my name and my order and they see me and ask me how I am doing. They truly care for the community and are here to make sure the Starbucks experience is truly in place wow oh wow thank you management!!!< /Text>

Great place love it here so nice and clean. Great service awesome cashier!! Great service this girl always helps me save money she always tells me deals on this app called cartwheel! Wow. Target is so amazing her name is Alyssa. She's so great to everyone who shops at target and she's the best cashier she's so helpful. If you ever need anything she will always do her best to make sure she can help you. Love this target because of her and so many other great employees another great employee named Gina helped me and checked if they had a product in the back room!! People are awesome also, when I went to the service desk to tell the manager about these amazing workers I also noticed the great service at guest service I love this target<//Review>

<Review>Their $25 off of $100 Toys and Games coupon is a joke. I have used this same coupon several times at the Corona and Menifee locations with no problem. I always buy the same thing with this coupon; Pokemon Cards. Tonight I went to the Lake Elsinore location and they refused to honor it. It took over 15 minutes to get a manager over to help, which she refused to help and said it was an exclusion on the coupon even though it was not stated in the exclusions and the coupon was promoted DIRECTLY ONTOP of where the cards are located. I left the store not purchasing anything (they missed out on $150 sale) I am a regular at this target and shop there weekly for groceries but I will start going to Walmart instead. The managers name was Carina and she was unhelpful, didn’t even introduce herself after I waited a long time for her to mosey over to us. When I got home I called customer relations and was told that Target is allowed to falsely “advertise coupons and not honor them if they feel like it”. This is ILLEGAL...< /Review>< resp>

Decent Target store, I like how merchandise and the store itself changes from time to time. Seasonal items as well as unique gifts can be purchased here. There are 3 restrooms near the entrance; men, women, and a private restroom. Fitting rooms are provided in the Men's clothes area. Some things are a bit pricey, however there are often discounted items on end caps (shelves at the end of each aisle).< /Text>

Many items are always out of stock, the shelves are stocked incorrectly (items in the wrong place, items covering stuff that is out, new items with no tags), expired product on the shelf, etc. This is by far the worst Target I’ve ever shopped at and it is a consistent problem.

Still the same problems consistently...no improvement. Lots of products ring up wrong, come up different prices in the Target App than the shelf shows, etc. 3-30-19

Ridiculously expired food (same product that expired in April and May of this year - its the end of August), consistently inaccurate pricing, poorly stocked shelves, out of stock in items all the time, cleanliness of the store. It is worse than WalMart anymore. 8-20-19<//review>

My families go to store for most of our family needs from apparel to groceries! Send the wife and she spends hours just browsing! Usually fairly clean. Some days it's like a tornado blew through but for the most part it is kept fairly clean. They have almost everything you would need for any occasion. If only it was a full on Super Target!< /Text>

Customer service is poor.   The white girl with the tattoos on her left arm was extremely rude Behind customer service desk. For someone that was bored and more willing to talk to other employees then to help the customer without a bitchy attitude. I would say 0 stars would be better than 1.<//text>

< Review>
Lost my wallet at target to only go back and find out someone had found it and returned to guest relations but the women at guest relations did not log in to being found . I had been informed by a target employee that a shopper had found a wallet and had taken it in earlier to the guest relations , I went then to realtions but the female working there ahead informed no one had brought by wallet  so I left but I did leave my contact info later on I get a call that my wallet is there to pick it up from that same person but only had 100 out of 400  why would someone that picked up the wallet leave only 100$ and take 400 $ and not take anything else and then take it to guest relations I honestly give my own opinion and would say look into that same worker she then askes me later on when I pick it up after me seeing those 100 if we were good like if I was satisfied with only the 100 left it was my payments for my classes .<//Review>

Everytime and I mean everytime I shop at this particular store I get charged the wrong price.   I have complained multiple times to the person in charge and they always say the manager will get in contact with me...Never happens, I get lame excuses why I get charged wrong , like they didn't have time to change out all the prices..  A company that big should have a good pricing team working   there to do their price changes..</Text>

<Review>I just left Target in Lake Elsinore and I'm highly frustrated with the employees who don't know how to do anything!!! I went to buy a suave gold product. First it was placed in the wrong area and marked wrong but they said they would honor it. It was 4.99 but honored for 2.99.  The lady took 15 minutes to go find and check the tag price of the product. Then she didn't know how to use the self check out what so ever, so I had to move to a register. Then she had no idea how to do anything on the register and it was absolutely frustrating!!! I would expect employees to know how to use their machines!!!! I had a manufacturers coupon and cartwheel both had $1.50 off the product. The cartwheel would not apply to the balance left after the manufacturers coupon. The lady said it couldn't use both $1.50 off but I obviously they're two different things so I can use them!!! So then I had to go to customers services which got even worse!!! The lady had no idea what do to about anything and she didn't wanna bother her supervisor because she was on lunch. After about 5 minutes of going back and fourth she finally radio her supervisor and she said because the item would total out to $0.00 the register wouldn't allow another $1.50 off. The lady said she couldn't do anything for me. I'm at the point of yelling at someone. Its not my problem your registers don't work that way. There was a long line of people behind me waiting and they were frustrated too. It's absolutely ridiculous target employees don't know how to do anything. And tell me they can't do anything for me. I should have gotten my product for free!!!  I'm 5 months pregnant and have registered for my baby shower but I will not have my family buy anything for target at all. I will be deleting my registery right now. And I will not be going back to target in lake Elsinore anymore.< /Review>< Pictures>

Score was messy and not stocked.  Displays and shelfs were a complete mess. Targets in nearby cities are so much nicer and updated.<//Text>

WORSE TARGET STORE EVER!!!!!!!!! Management is absolutely horrible. My brother with autism recently got hired there then because a "customer" complained saying he used foul language when assisting him they fired him on the spot. Not even questioning if it was even true. They don't treat their staff well at all!!!! My brother is the sweetest person ever. He has a disability! He would never do anything like this!!!! I WILL CONTINUE TO POST EVERYDAY ABOUT THIS!!!! I'll also be posting on Facebook and going to the store to let all customers know what kind of place they are supporting!!!!!! Anyone who knows someone with a disability knows how hard it is for them to get a job!!! My brother was beyond thrilled at this opportunity! Now he is absolutely crushed not understanding who someone would do this when he would never say anything like that! DO NOT GO TO THIS TARGET! Who ever management is I hope you see this! I'll be in to talk to you as well!!! ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. CRYSTAL IS THE MANAGER RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.</Text>

<text>This target used to be great, but the past several months it's gone extremely downhill. On the slowest day in the middle of January they were sold out of tons of things, prices were miss marked all over, the whole store was a complete disaster, and their self checkouts were down like usual. Like I said, I used to enjoy this store but it's gone very downhill. Pretty sad because Walmart used to be this way but recently stepped up their game and is actually a lot more organized, clean, and their self checkouts are usually always working. Pretty disappointing.< /text>< pics>

The past few times I've been there. You have multiple items out of stock and when someone checks there are none on there way. I'm getting tired of the wrong price. I really have to pay attention to the prices, they are always higher at the register. The price is always fixed when I tell them. But still the wrong prices are on the shelf.  Alot of slacking going on.< /Text>

Amazing service, the gal who checked me out, showed me how to link my red card and establish a account with the target app, so was able to get multiple discounts on my purchases. She also explained how to use the app for future purchases. 😀< /review>

Intrusive I don't understand why Target insists on swiping driver's license for the purchase of its nicotine gum when no other store I've ever visited for the same purchase has made such an outrageous demand. Walmart, Costco do not require your driver's license information to be downloaded into their computer system. And when you consider Target's reputation for not keeping their customers information secure it becomes an even harder pill to swallow. Showing identification is one thing downloading it into their computer system is another I would not recommend Target to anyone</text>

This store is never as crowded as other targets.
Clean and very helpful employees. Even though target is a little more expensive than Wal-Mart I will always choose this location over any Wal-Mart due to cleanliness and customer service.< /text>

Very unorganized. Everything is out of place and prices are wrong 99% of the time. When you bring it up they act like you're lying. Half of my items today rang up as a different price they were listed under. This happens with almost every visit.< /Review>

Not a large variety of merchandise to choose from from this to be a major chain. Not sure if it's due to location or why, but Target usually carries more product. I'm always highly dissatisfied with lack of variety in this store and lack of items listed in ad. Only come here if I don't want to drive further. Also the store clothing items and shoes are often in disarray and messy, especially in the kids sections.<//text>

Ever since my review 8 months ago the shelves are stocked and cleaned regularly, in fact there were plenty of boxes of Pokemon TCG that were quite a few generations back so we were able to finish our collections without paying surcharged prices due to the age of generation. The boxes of stock have been moved out of the front checkout area of the collectibles aisle. The bathrooms have been cleaned up as well which is a major plus for me. Customer service is still great. And the helpfullness and stock is always above and beyond. Thanks Target!

Target is a convenient place for me to shop when I need to grab baby items, groceries, and a few other miscellaneous items. This Target in particular is easy to navigate and generally well stocked with the items I need. However, there are a couple area's that could use some improvement. For instance, you can tell when an area has been given a blind eye due to it's location, my husband collects Pokemon cards and it seems that the two areas that carry these cards are hardly stocked, usually disheveled with card packs not being in the right place, and cramped with empty boxes or carts strewn about the aisles and shelves. I could understand packs not being on the right hooks because there are usually children who look through these, however when your shopping experience is hindered because you have to sift through empty boxes, or push multiple carts out of an already cramped space it makes it feel like you went into the backroom where the stock is kept, and to see the same mess on different days, it makes you wonder if they give any attention to these two locations. Secondly, the bathrooms are always a wreck. I have never seen restrooms so messed up. Again, I can understand after a rush, or maybe because of the holidays, but again when you come to your local Target and see the same mess over several days it makes you wonder how much time they devote to such a private and public place. Overall customer service is good, you can get fast assistance when you need it, and the clerks are always attentive.< /text><date>1517438095931< /date><user>115847846659291172314</user>< Resp>

<review>For the first time I am  really disappointed with target and the  inconsistency with information regarding available products for sale. I have bought a crib and painted and decorated my nursery according to this set and went back to get the dresser that matched the crib that I had bought just weeks earlier .  I contacted Target and the manufacturer and they both told me It was not available and they told me they confirmed by the vendor that it was discontinued in the color I needed. It caused me to be very distressed during my pregnancy I was really looking forward to having this matching set set . The store has it displayed with the other color as a option to get , saying it is available . so I preplanned by nursery around this when it's really not available.  I have contacted different targets the online target help center the Facebook help center and actually delta children's manufacture and everyone is told me the same thing .  I really feel that is false advertisement when it says that it's in the store available then come to find out it wasn't . Despite the information I was given I continued to search for the project and try every day a few times a day and then and then it just so happened one time I did try it and it allowed me to put it in my cart and purchase it. I was so fearful I would get a email saying the same thing every one else told me . Then my husband contacted another target email that we had found and they told him it actually was available just by online ordering.  So we ordered it don't have it yet but hopefully we get it and not given the wrong information AGAIN . Which I'm so confused being told by like 7 different people it wasn't available  ? Bottom of the line i am so relived that I am able to get it in the end , but that was so much stress that shouldn't of Happened ... I am spending a lot of money at target and it's just very disappointing.....< /review><response>None<//response><username>Rachel Bleeker</username></record>

<user>112083562932496566729<//user><text>First I am so tired of the prices on the shelves being different from the price on my receipt, for example I bought Arm&Hammer Double Duty Kitty Litter 26.3 LBS.the price on the shelf was 10.69,( I checked the tag, and weight ) I was charged 11.49 at register,this has happened before and I keep having the same problem, hope it will be corrected but it happened again today.Second I saw on a end aisle Honey bunches of oats, for 3.79 I thought it was a good price so I grabbed a box, when I get home and check my receipt I payed 4.19 for it, this is false advertising,as I would NOT have bought it for 4.19,it seems every time I go to the Elsinore Target this happens several times on one trip there.</text></record></dataset><record>

I got a late Christmas gift that didn't work so I took it back here (which this was the location the person bought it) to exchange for one that worked. The person working customer service wouldn't let me do an even exchange; instead gave me a gift card for less then what the product is worth telling me to pay the difference. When I complain that doesn't seem right because the item was broken in the first place she said that it was policy because I didn't have a receipt.  I asked to speak to someone who could help me and she told me there was no one that could. I took the card then went back to electronics to get a manager.  The manager on duty did resolve the issue (which is why I am giving two stars and not one.) This is just one of many issues I have had in the last year.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Employees seemingly don't care if you want something that is out of stock. They'll pretend to check but just tell you it's out. (I've worked at Target and know how they go about actually getting things from the back.) Strangely this store is lacking many items found at surrounding Targets.<//review>
