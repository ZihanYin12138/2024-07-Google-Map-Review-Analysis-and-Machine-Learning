Very good food in my opinion. Prices are very reasonable. I would defiantly recommend any one to stop by and check it out. Also good friendly people that own or work there is a plus. Old style place my favorite.</Review>

<review>BEST bean and cheese !  AMAZING fish tacos.  I recommended  highly California taco , your choice of meat. I prefer ground beef. THE O. G. Wednesday 99 cents fish tacos. Monday is 99 cents soft tacos. Your choice of meat. I come here at least once a week. Customer Service is amazing.

The food never arrived! A family member passed away. I ordered food for the mourning family and the restaurant never delivered it and didn’t notify me. The family waited and waited for their food and it never arrived and they never called me so i thought it was delivered via Grubhub. What kind of restaurant does this? And no apology. This is really unethical. Do not patronize this restaurant! Do not eat here.<//review>

The food here is good! Get a hardshell taco, you won't be disappointed (They're big!). I normally go on Wednesdays for their $1 fish tacos. I've also had their wet burrito which was good.</text>

<review>Fogata means campfire in Spanish, or so I was told. I love this place. It's a mother and son operation. The tacos are fantastic, I especially like their fish taco. Prices are low. There seems to be outdoor seating but I never tried it. There are a few tables inside but mostly it's just a take-out food place. You'll enjoy it, I promise.<//review><name>Jim Nln</name><rating>4< /rating><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

< review>
Upfront notice: this is not my usual balanced review. You can get the ambience, service, and other factors from the numerous reviews on here. My five stars rating is solely for the uniqueness of the OLD CALIFORNIA TACO (OCT) here. I have not seen it anywhere else. It was tasty. It exists only here. It deserves  five stars for being.

$7.99 for a taco? Si senior. It's the size of a dinner plate and it was worth it. This behemoth size puts many burritos to shame. And I finished it in one seating. And I hated myself for finishing it.... but that's beside the point. Let's get back to the OTC

It's a cross over between a taco and a flauta. The shell is a large fluffy fried tortilla folded in half. Inside is filled to the brim with a layer of beans and your choice of meat. Mine was asada and it was very very good. The toppings of salad, sour cream, cheese, tomato, and salsa were then layered on top of the taco and filled out the plate. It was an impressive and intimidating sight for a taco. It was served with knife and fork. And you need them. There was no way to eat this beast with hands.

I imagined two amigos seating at a camp fire on the range somewhere in CA reminiscing of home made tacos from the old country. They talked with gusto and bravado...

Jose: the tacos here just ain't right
Roberto: they are so leeeeto here I'm still hungry.
J: my home town taco was bee-g and proper
R: I bet mine was bee-ger.
J: You should see my HT taco. It's bee-ger than your hand.
R: My HT taco is bee-ger than two hands.
J: Well my HT taco is bee-ger than a dinner plate.....

Thus began the legend of the OCT< /review>

<Text>Well the food was not real mex food the chile relleno sauce bland no cheese and too ecpensive fish tacos are no good they were burnt batter .but the guy there was really nice but its all about food the green chile salsa was ok red one also California taco was god but the ground beef needed flavor also it was more like a taco salad .car itas was not real carnitas .oh and also the hvac system they have seems to to suck out smoke so we all felt a little like we got carbon minoxide poisoning. U can smell thehot oil fryer burning so i actually felt like showing them real mex food .but i give a chance.overall do i recomend it ummmm no dont waste money here there is alot of other choices that are way better like taco bell .now i aint trying to be mean but its tru the ground beef from tbell is way more tasty.fogata mexicana is more like suckagata.</Text><time>1469554551474</time>< UserId.>

Food and service were excellent! Mikela was by far one of the best waitresses we have ever had! She really helped make my friend's birthday even more spectacular.< /Text>

This station is a block away from the very first Forever 21 store. It's also probably one of the stations as outside has flower gardens by the sitting area.<//text>

I plan visits to LA just to sit at this bar. It’s more than a bar. Not to be cliche but it’s an experience. You’ll get a master class in great cocktails and amazing music.

<Resp>None< /Resp><rate>4</rate><review>VINYL! God, nothing better than the sound of vinyl. And I love a dark bar! We got there at 5:30pm on a Thursday before the crowd and it was still sunny outside. The music was 70s funk/disco and the handsome bartenders were grooving to it. But with the gigantic vinyl collection you could hear any kind of music. 2 single person clean bathrooms. I only gave it 4 stars because I didn’t care for my margarita but I should have ordered whiskey or their specialities. My friends liked their drinks a lot.</review></record>

<Text>Incredible that Highland Park has yet another amazing bar. Really liked the atmosphere and vibe of the place and it stands out as unique amongst all the cool newish bars in the area. The Figueroa strip is definitely the place to be if you want to dine and bar hop.

Went on a Friday night and the place was crowded (in a good way). Went for a beer as I'd already been drinking but I do want to go back and try some cocktails. DJ booth at one end of the bar. A roomier seating area at the back. It's just next door to the HomeState tacos and just down the block from Cafe Birdie. Drink responsibly and come on the Train! Gold Line Highland Park station only a block or two away.< /Text><time>1544308702309< /time></record>

<text>Gold Line is as mega trendy as it sounds, but in the best way. Walking in , you're immediately transported into a sultry eighties ambiance, the vibiest of vibes possible. The walls are lined with vinyl, the DJ smoothly takes you from one classic to the next, and the furniture exudes a come and chill energy. I made it all the way from the west side, and it was def worth.< /text>< user>

It's a great bar, except for the bouncer that's beggar pimping the $1.25 lady. You can spot them counting her haul at the door when it's slow.</Text>

I came into Dr. V’s office unable to walk and in deep pain. Dr. V helped to educate me on my spine and where my pain was coming from which I appreciated very much. I had been to chiropractors before but had never met someone who was so passionate in educating their patients for long term care. After only one week of being adjusted and cared for in Dr. V’s office, I am able to walk again and have learned more about the health of my back and spine. I am very appreciative of the knowledge Dr. V has shared with me as well as the treatment he has given me.</text>

<Text>My husband and I have been going to Dr. V for nearly two years now and it’s been one of the best health decisions we’ve made. Before coming to Dr. V I was having almost daily migraines and I just thought it was stress related. After I came in for my consult and had my first adjustment, it almost immediately stopped my migraines. This is an ongoing process, so there’s no one and done fix. But it’s so worth it to invest your time and commitment to chiropractic care, especially for the long term impacts it has. I recommend Dr. V to anyone looking for a chiropractor. He’s informative, flexible schedule for emergencies, and genuinely such a kind, caring person. We always look forward to our appointments not only because of the satisfying cracking sound, but because Dr. V is always such a joy to talk to.< /Text>< Pics>

JV is very personable and shows care for your health every time you walk in the door. My wife and I are long term customers of the Chiropractic practice and have both experienced improvement with JV's help. I would not hesitate to recommend this chiropractic office if you are considering getting help and both short or long term care.<//text>

I am receiving treatment from Dr. V. since a couple of months. To be honest I was looking for a female therapist in the beginning, but Dr. V. was strongly recommended by someone to me and I thought I will give it a try. Dr. V. is very knowledgeable and professional and made me feel  comfortable and my back pain improved within the shortest time. I also enjoy his positive and upbeat nature - who says getting great treatment can't also be fun?</text>

Dr. V is great! His enthusiasm about your overall Heath is on point. My headaches have subsided and I am more conscious about my posture and spine health. Committing to a care plan can seem daunting but Dr. V lays it’s all out for you and does all the hard work. I will recommended him to all my family, friends and even strangers!</Text>

Dr.V truly has your back! I came in not knowing much about what a chiropractor does or really what the process would be. He scheduled one of the appointments a little longer to go over the  benefits of a chiropractor and how patients can have misalignments without even having any pain. I came in having lower back pain and within a few adjustments (3-5) along with icing my back twice a day, I have been pain free. Dr.V also has a great high-energy personality that makes you look forward to the next appointment!

I will be coming back to this office for years to come!</Review>

<text>I've seen other chiropractors in my past which did not relieve my low back issues/pain.  After seeing Dr. V. for about 9 months I can say without a doubt that my back pain has improved significantly.  There have been days where I have been completely pain free - something I haven't been able to say in over 20 years.  Dr. V. is great and I'd highly recommend him!</text>< Name>

Been seeing Dr. Vorzimer for a bit over a year now. Very enthusiastic individual. You walk into his office and you are greeted with his big cheerful smile. As a Doctor; Dr.  Vorzimer really takes the time to make sure you understand how chiropractic healing works, as well as how he can adjust your back, and on your way to recovery.</Review>

By far one of the best chiropractic experiences I've had.  Jonas is a class act and very knowledge in his field.  He took the time to explain in detail how chiropractic care works and why I may have been feeling what I was feeling. After 4 months of treatment I am happy to say 90% of my neck pain has been alleviated.  I couldn't be happier with my results!  Thank you!</text>

She and her whole family have, for many years, received care from Dr. V for a variety of issues and have had great results. Dr. V added me into his schedule quickly and I felt relief right away starting with my first visit.  Dr. V is super knowledgeable and really cares about teaching his patients about chiropractic health, and good health in general. I always walk away from an appointment feeling relief and having gained a lot of  very useful information to help me be a healthier and happier me!<//Text>< Pictures>

Dr Jonas is a true pro who taught me a lot I did not expect from a busy Chiropractor. He truly treats you like his only client and I would recommend him strongly. My symptoms are gone and I could not be happier.<//Text>

I started seeing Dr. Vorzimer towards late 2017, and discovered some nagging neck pain was probably the latent result of a car accident. After several months of treatment, I slowly but surely felt that pain go away, as well as an increase in my range of motion. He is very interested in his patients' lives and makes an effort to get to know them, and also works with you as far as payment plans. Some reviews state that signing into a payment agreement can be daunting, it may be true but they are not binding, and it's also true that some people would simply not come back to keep their alignment problems in check if they feel it has been cured. It's a process, not simply a one-n-done type of deal. He cares for ongoing treatment and to make sure patients thrive.< /text>

<text>Dr. Vorzimer is a miracle worker when it comes to your back and neck. He is patient and always on time along with being compassionate and caring. He is not only an excellent chiropractor but he listens and is very easy to work with.</text>< pics>

Dr. Vorzimer is a great, kind and caring chiropractor.  I had many issues when I started with him, and he has been able to resolve them and keep me pretty much pain free!<//review>

What's the deal with No Scooters?
But you have golf carts speeding all over the lot and walkways.

Prospect Studios has a warm and friendly atmosphere. My sister and I just visited the studio this Monday and everyone whom we came in contact with greeted us with a smile. I was a complete stranger and they welcomed me with open arms! My sister and I walked around the studio with a friend and took some pictures. It was a wonderful experience.

I'm a filmmaker and I love The Prospect Studios (also known as ABC Television Center, a lot containing several television studios located at 4151 Prospect Avenue in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, at the corner of Prospect and Talmadge Street (named in honor of silent screen star Norma Talmadge), just east of Hollywood. I work here on General Hospital and I enjoy it. For more than 50 years, this facility served as the West Coast headquarters of the American Broadcasting Company before the network moved its main headquarters to the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. From 1949 to 1999, ABC-owned Los Angeles television station KABC-TV was also located there. Truly inspirational. The station moved to a new state-of-the-art facility located on a portion of Disney's Grand Central Creative Campus (GC3) in nearby Glendale, California, in December 1999. The Walt Disney Company, which acquired ABC in 1996, continues to own and operate the facility to this day. I'm looking forward visiting again. Best, George Anton ANTFLIX< /text>

They film some ABC shows here. It's a regular film studio. Don't expect to be let on without an appointment.< /Text>

< Review>
Prospect Studios is a bad neighbor. Year after year they have failed to do anything about the filth, street trash and debris that collects in front of the studio grounds.

The build up of trash and leaves causes the gutters to block up and flooding to occur during our rainy season.

The sidewalks bordering the studio are essentially their front yard and as such are Prospect Studios responsibility. How Prospect Studios can live with their clients driving through such a mess is beyond me.<//Review>

< Review>
Pulled in needing two new tires. They had them in stock at price none of the four other tire shops I went to first where offering. About 40% less I spent about 30mins the time I pulled in to the time I was driving out with my new tires I would highly recommend them to anyone who's in that area and needs tires. They have both new and used and you probably won't find a better deal. The employees were wearing masks and they're outside waiting area was definitely compliant with the covid-19 restrictions.</Review>

They are the worst you can find. They will try to make you buy their tires even if you don't need to and if you refuse, they get mad and treat you poorly. I highly recommend going to a different place.< /review>

Do not go here. Horrible customer service. I just bought 2 used tires and 1 tire immediately went flat. I called and asked if they could look at it and the owners response was "there's no warranty ". I never asked about warranty. They are used tires. But his response tells customers everything. He will sell you tires that are flat and and laugh. Never go to his business ever.</review>

They need to be organized better, I was the first one there to get my tire changed and three other cars came after and were served before I was. Overpriced tires and poor customer service wont go back again, Its better to  go down the street to the other tire shop by State street you get a better deal and their customer service is far better.<//text>

Kind of expensive. We didn’t mind the extra $15 we would’ve saved at a different shop but when they took 40 min to change one tire...we were a little annoyed.<//Text>

Too long of a wait, not organized, you have to look around and ask, who's in change? like they don't acknowledge you are there. 👎🏻 no stars from me! 👎🏻</Text>

I don't understand how anyone can post a bad review about this place....They are very friendly and their tires and prices are great! My last set of used tires I purchased here lasted two years and I came back today for another set.

<Text>Nice workers very friendly but a bit unorganized. Customer service could be better I almost left since every time a car came in they stopped working on my tire. Isn't that what the office girl should be doing? Guess it was too cold and windy for her to leave the office.   What should have been a 15/20 min fix took over an hour since there was only one car ahead of me when I came in. I wasn't to pleased that they took care of 3 smaller vehicles tire repairs before they finally  got to my truck even though I came in well ahead of time before the other 3 cars.< /Text><gmapID>0x80c35335aaaaaaab:0x6f88d34480e651dc</gmapID>< Date>

If you want a real deal or just good work overall, then this place is not for you! Befor everything they "got me" on the sensor not even factory would of save $40 just by going to the deal my self.  Then i asked the "tire guy"  if he didnt have a shallow tire socket  that "I would  rather him use this one i had ? He said "no the have one "  well they did not  Scratched on the paint on hole for the sockets. Then i guess they dont know how to  mount 20" tires , then dug some scratches into the inside of the lip....hahahahah
Im ill pass.....good luck</text>

Over priced menu, $8.99 plus tax for a basic carne asada burrito. Not worth it.< /Text>

<review>The food is good. There’s a little wait. Everything is made from scratch, so what do you expect. My first experience was okay. The second time I went in there, My friend tried to bring in a bottled water from outside. And that didn’t go to well for him. I’m guessing it was the owner. Told him no outside drinks, and that she didn’t need anyone to get sick from outside food or drinks and then write a bad review on them. She was so rude my buddy wanted to leave. But I was starving and convinced him to stay. The waitress at least apologized for her rude boss. But that is the last time I will go there. In the summer it’s super hot in their small building and in the winter they don’t run the heater. But yes the food is good. Environment and atmosphere need a lot of work and self-evaluation.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>2</rating></record></dataset><record>

Everything us freshly made so its a little slow but worth it! These are the best pupusas I've had in many many years. They have a Salvadoran menu and a Mexican menu. Will definitely come back again!<//Text>

<text>The service was good, but the pupusas, cortido, and salsa de tomate, were all lacking in flavor. The pupusas needed more cheese, salt, the cortido tasted just like cabbage and water. The ensalada had tiny bits of fruit. It was mostly all juice.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1504491894176, 'text': "Thank you N Ortiz for your review we regret to hear the experience you wasn't a great one.

Great customer service!!!
They have all the prepaid companies and awesome selection for cell phone accessories. If they don't have the accessories for your phone at the moment, they will order it for you. Its a great option instead of driving around looking for it.
They also sell SPECTRUM internet service
UNLIMITED GIGABYTES and take payment for it.<//text>

<text>Very friendly staff, prices are a little high, but they have all the basics covered.  The mechanics are good but I would not trust them with technical repairs.  I bought my tires there and they said they would mount them for free, but charged 5 bucks to take the wheels off.  I thought that was a cheap shot.  Then they some how got air in my front brake line.  Took it back and the same thing.  That is why I would not trust them with technical work. I give them three stars because they are average.  Not bad but not great.</text>< user_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I have been to many motorcycle shops all over the world, Finally I moved back to the area 2 years ago and found everything I need from SC Rider Supply when it comes to my two wheeled children. This places makes you feel right at home,   They Honor and  Love their Service Veterans, their Community and Customers. Rick and Roxanne are beyond what a motorcycle business owner Truly  Represents.  They take care of their customers,  They are straight forward and honest as well as all the staff there. I recommend this place to everyone needing anything MOTO.<//Review>< UserId.>

<Review>Great staff! Couldn't get better more honest guys. They put new tires on my bike and that went well!
My poor old bikes starter went out two weeks later( old bike problems) and I brought it to them to fix it and they tried but the old yeller was just done with 😭😭. They didn't charge me for the days of hour they must have put in to try and fix it. Like I said great honest guys. Would give 10 stars if I could.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I had a lot of issues and had to go back 3 times to get everything correct. It took a lot of extra messing around but everything was resolved in the long run.
The rushed the job so everything was loose and parts were missing and incorrect.
They ordered all the correct parts and are sending them to me now and I feel as though we reached an amicable solution.
I'm 50/50 now staff is nice but definitely shouldn't have been this difficult.<//text>

Brought them my wheels from my Harley Roadking... purchased a set of Michelin Commander 2 tires, they had them in stock and while I went to lunch they had the tires mounted and balanced!  Tires were a little more expensive than some other places but NO CHARGE for the mounting and balancing brought the total to a little less than anywhere else!
This is my new shop for product and service, everyone there was very professional and helpful.</Text>

What sets this place apart from every other bike shop is the affable nature of each and every person you meet here. I know other riders out there know what I'm talking about when you go into a bike service shop and they make you feel like you are just lucky to be there.
Not here. You get a name and a handshake from each person you meet, the mechanics are knowledgable and dont give you grief if your a noob.

The prices are fair and the work is done without excess services being pushed. I cannot say how highly I reccomend these people and their business.<//Review>

<resp>None< /resp><pics>None<//pics><review>I dont usually write these bad type of reviews. But they ruined my zx10r by recommending me to do something for hundreds of dollars and letting the bike super shaky, wobbling all over the place very dangerous, I remember how the owner after I told him how the bike was going he literally said: "nah thats alright" and I thought, well thats alright for you cause you got the money but I got a very wobbly and dangerous bike (this was literally minutes after he worked on it). So disrespectful, he said: "pfff, give me the bike, I'll try it" and went to test it and instead of recognizing the issue he told me again: "its ok" I couldnt belive it!!!! Even the other guys who were working there notice the problem cause this other fella took it for a ride because i didnt want to keep his "its ok" and kill myself. And this kid told me what happened that they broke when doing what he recommended me and left the bike very bad that needed to be replace with a new one and of course that I did it in DreamsMotorcycle up north a couple of miles.

I will never forget this. That day I spent 673 dollars and I am not exaggerating (cause they suggest it) and brake fluids (that last was good). I'll never forget his manners. Cant remember his name. Owner. But Roxanna was very nice.

I just think they just want money and not really worry about you.

Worst experience I've had in a mechanic. I just had to write it somewhere. He should learn some manners and be nice with people, specially when you screw up a bike that you suggested working on.

Sorry but I had to write this. So hopefully next time you treat a client nicer and better than with me. Cause I do care of my life riding my motorcycle, not like you. Thats really what it made me feel.<//review><userid>108694400140956264166<//userid>< name>

It was wonderful up until the young man who was helping me left and an older man came upstairs to "help" me. From the moment he walked in he was extremely rude and sexist observing me because obviously since I happen to be female I don't know what I'm doing. I was specifically looking at the mesh jackets looking and feeling the protectors and seeing if I could figure out what they are made of so I could possibly dye one in the future. He was looking down on me and when he noticed I kept looking over stuff more than once to be sure he acted very hostile. Obviously this is a man's store and only men are welcome. I loved the store up until that man came in. If you're trying to gather information and happen to be female I would try somewhere else. But if you  see a young man inside, I would definitely visit because though the  older man was horribly rude the young man was kind and answered my questions with a smile. Over all it was okay but I personally don't think I'll be coming back to this store anytime soon. But if you're a man this is probably the perfect store for you.< /text>

Got valves adjusted on crf250x costed normal and they did good, got my tires changed on same and it costed &45 each cause I have tubbliss and they changed my intertubes without asking at $20 extra, bought a $150 oring chain and they said they'd crimp the master link once I installed it and I did then when I brought it back they over crimped it and crushed the O-ring and when I brought it back a week later they told me it was because I did not maintain the chain well and then they put another Link in there and overcurrent it again and then I asked for someone else to do it. Older mechanic is great he did it right the first time and I got it back no problem.

<Text>I've been using them for years and will continue. They are open everyday and with my schedule thats important. Great staff that are always ready to help and answer questions. Tire prices are excellent and free mounting if you take the tire off. I washed all my bikes yesterday and I haven't been riding the super moto much lately so I drained the gas. Rode it to the gas station and noticed the clip for the master link was missing, Scary. I putted it over to their shop(On A Sunday)(On Any Sunday!) and Rick hooked me up with a clip and popped it on for me. They had a guy there that was dropping his Cruiser off for service. Roxanne was going to give him a ride home! Now thats service and thats why I only go there!!!!!!!!! Thank you Rick and Roxanne.</Text>< Pics>

⭐️ Jessie’s customer service was PHENOMENAL! ⭐️
He seamlessly walked us through the entire process. Jessie helped our family of four get everything we wanted and then some! His expertise and patience turned a stressful situation into an enjoyable experience. I personally want to thank Jessie for going above and beyond for our family. You exceeded our expectations in every way!< /Review>

Caesar a Verizon employee found my mother in laws phone at the beach and reached out to me to have her phone returned to her. We couldn't have been more grateful we looked for  hours for the phone and had to call it quits. We had a 2 hour drive back home. Caesar was so gracious and took the time to ship us back the phone. We appreciate what he did and actions like that shows the reflection of his great character and great customer service. Thank you for your honesty Caesar you are definitely someone I would go to help me with my phone in the future. Just to add we are Verizon customers ourselves and feel proud to have Verizon agents that go beyond customer service. Thank you Caesar.

Even though there was a line of people waiting, the staff were quick to let everyone know the waiting situation, how long it would take, etc. Everyone was quick and informative and most of all highly professional! I would recommend anyone go to this location for your phone needs!</review>

Maybe a month after I drop my phone at work and my screen cracked horribly.  So I go again to the  store and Jesse, Cesar, and Chris all took care of me. I got a s20 plus brand spanking new and a 2020 samsung tab A with no more than my previous contract even cheaper . Yes the first bill will be higher than usual but remember business is business.

AVOID AVOID AVOID  this location. Go to a corporate store instead. If you ask the clerk for their last name, they will refuse to provide it.  Is that because they mislead their customers? At the corporate store, their full name are listed on their badges and the customer service is great.  Still dealing with a "free tablet" issue that was NOT FREE. Do not believe them when they tell you something is free. It is a LIE.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Jordan was awesome - I have multiple phone lines and just came in to browse and compare my Sprint account to Verizon to see if there would possibly be any possible savings. I wasn’t even prepared to switch - Jordan explained everything in detail and and showed a lot of patience in thoroughly answering all of my 100 questions. In the end he provided my family with everything we had at Sprint with a monthly savings of $125. I always thought Verizon would be more expensive. He then took care of all our Verizon promotional opportunities we received by moving my account. I moved our entire family plan to Verizon after 18 years with Nextel/ Sprint due to his attentive customer service and understanding how to deliver all of the cellular needs of our family.</review>< Pictures>

Remarkable customer service from the employees at this location. They took the time to further analyze my account and lower my monthly bill as well as offer me the Hum.The representatives fully explained every change made to my account and in accurate detail. I’ll admit at first I was not too sure about upgrading my iPhone 6 because the screen would freeze on me from time to time, but the reps here managed to still transfer all of my photos and contacts to the iPhone 8 I purchased. I’ve never felt more confident with upgrading my device!< /Text>

Came in with my parents to purchase a phone and Sandy the manager there was so friendly and helpful that I just had to leave a review for her. She helped my parents lower their bill even with me getting a new phone. She was awesome, and so was everyone else working there.< /review>

Went in for a new phone after I dropped and broke mine. Griffin helped us out right away and he didn't try to sell us a bunch of stuff. Got a new phone with all old phone transferred over in about an hour. It was quick and painless. I've spent several hours getting a new phone and always hate doing it but this was so easy!</Text>

Went in to upgrade my phone and was honestly dreading going in at first due to bad past experiences, but the new girls working there were so friendly and extremely helpful with setting me up with a new phone! They truly made the whole experience quick and painless! Will definitely be coming back to upgrade my future phones!!!<//Review>

DON'T BUY YOUR PHONE OR PLAN HERE! This is not a direct Verizon store (as they state), but as such - you get scammed into buying everything thinking it's "included" in the package, and there's no protection for you from Verizon on any of these purchases!
They scammed me into purchasing "accessories" (a phone case and screen protector) for approx. $30 each! - which are easily found on Amazon for $10 a piece - saying that these "come with the phone".  And then they said the Hum device is included in the package when you add on a line. I didn't find out until after I left that it was additional, and then an extra activation fee! (Even though it was never installed in my car, and it's still sitting in the box). And when I called to return - they said it's passed the window of returning. Despite the fact that it's never been touched.
Worse off - I traded in my phone (which was quite new - an iPhone 6 - and had no issues) - and they said it would be applied towards my new device payment plan. It wasn't. When disputed over the phone they said it was applied to the "taxes" on the new phone - which was a near equivalent of the phone value. Taxes on a device should be applied on your monthly payment - not a full price upfront. Their entire selling strategy obviously works for them because they scam everyone into paying hundreds more! DON'T GO HERE!!!<//text>

<text>Verizon wireless store in Fontana, CA takes advantage of senior citizens. I have been on the phone and at their corporate store trying to get this taken care of. They offered a free tablet and didn't disclosed to an elderly man that there is line access fee for the tablet, they included insurance, asked if he wanted some accessories as if they were free then charged he for everything and all he wanted was unlimited data and didn't even give him what he asked for. before he left there should have reviewed everything but didn't just put the receipts and contract in the bag and told him he was all set. this is very deceptive practice. The shouldn't be allowed to take advantage of the elderly.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1495732369188, 'text': 'Hello, Theresa.

I called the night before the iPhone X launch. Someone who said his name was Jayson ttold me they didn’t have any extra iPhone Xs, only pre orders. Then, miraculously, they found one someone “had canceled.” Then they said I️ couldn’t apply my trade in but had to mail it to Verizon. Then, when they finally agreed to give me the right trade in value as a down payment so my monthly payments would be manageable, they told me about the mandatory accessory package for $150. I️ was even willing to pay it — dumb, I️ know— but then they said it had to come either with a Hum or a Samsung tablet or I️ would have to pay $259 to get a new iPad, none of which I️ want or need.

The rep asked Victor, the “store manager, “ who I️ suspect was actually Jayson playing bad cop in the in-person role and good cop by cell, said, No, I️ can’t do it without that. This is a $1,000 Phone.” So I️ walked. I️ know it costs that much. That’s what I️ was going to pay and then some. I️ feel completely misled and ripped off. They lied and wasted my time.</Text>

They lie. Cassie said you have to buy accessories when you get a new phone. No choice. I verified with a corporate verizon store that that's not true. Although too late for me, I'm warning everyone to stay away from that Verizon store.

Btw, accessories are grossly overpriced< /text>

<review>Vicki thinks it's okay to use the same glove for the whole day. Vicki takes money, touches cash register, gas pumps, walls, and whatever else she touches before making a coffee. She hands customer they're coffee and proceeds to scratch her back and neck. Without changing her yellow(once white) gloves, she attends to the next customer without changing them. Therea no point in having the cashier make peoples coffee, when it takes more time and leaves yellow fingerprints, perhaps from smoking, on my coffee lid. Freaken disgusting.<//review>< time>

Nice staff, but the extra debit fee and semi-small drink selection hold it back from being better.</Text>

Great staff! Though maybe shift leader Jessie should learn what legal tender is, if he wants to advance in any business.

Coinage and cash and what "we" refer to as legal tender. They have definitions for very specific reasons, most of which are "legal." Just because you are lazy, and a shift leader does not justify refusing legal tender, especially on behalf of a business you are employed for and not own.</Review>

Usually have 1 pump that doesn't work. Very often need to go into the store to get the receipt!
They get too tired to change rolls.
Idiot folk leave their cars at the pump to go into the store and take forever to come out and pump their gas...big pain...<//Review>

<text>The post-pandemic demise of in person dinning is vastly overstated.  This is a perfect example: attentive service, nice ambience, fresh off the grill smoky hot pizza and the excitement of walking into a well regarded restaurant.  We just had great food and a great time here.<//text>< pictures>

Started coming here with its proximity to work, but now anytime I'm passing through the vicinity I grab a cuppa here.  They have fresh, house made almond milk that has no silly aftertastes (even I, as a whole milk-loving fiend, enjoy it!), and the folks here are always kind, and even recognize their regulars and their peculiarities (always appreciated from a neighborhood coffee shop).<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>This was really not special and the service wasn’t so great. The floor looks like a garage and the pizza is just ok. First make a better dough with flavor— let it rise at least 12 hours. Should take better advantage of those hot ovens and cook the crust first to get crispy before putting sauce on.  The best thing was actually the chicken wings.  Nothing special here—definitely not coming for pizza again! I’ll make it myself give me the oven!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Picked up brunch a week back. Got these:
- polenta & eggs
- farmers market quiche
- country bread
- coffee (obviously)

Really liked all of it. I don't generally like polenta, but theirs was good! It was also the heaviest, portion size-wise.
The quiche was fantastic - I think they use way more dough than egg and it's cooked with a ton of butter. So yum!
The country bread was great too. Wish there were more slices hah.
Plus good coffee - pricey though ($4.5 for a cup, I think?).

Will visit again.< /Text>

Milo & Olive makes my favorite pizza in LA. It’s simply delicious, starting with the flavorful crust. My go-to is the mixed mushroom. The butternut squash is quite good as well and unique. I also appreciate the farmers market and seasonal focus of their ingredients.<//Text>

<text>I ordered takeout and everything was fine as usual. I got spaghetti & meatballs for my sister and hand-cut fettuccine for myself. Our dishes were so tasty and I don't know which one was tastier. I like homemade pasta and different kind of sauces. Walnut-basil pesto was awesome, so good. I'm a big fan of this place!<//text><UserId.>117570390461586691238</UserId.>< Name>

Excellent food and service.  I placed an order to go for the large garlic knot (amazing) and the person on the phone was very courteous and helpful. The only thing I would recommend is for the employees to know prices a bit better. The inside of the restaurant is very modern and open.

Highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch and will be coming back soon.<//text>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Great westside spot that is very consistent and simple menu. Highly recommend this book for a low-key dinner and always go with the specials. With tax and tip and one drink one appetizer two main courses and two desserts it comes out to about $60 per person with tax tip and everything out the door. he wait list online can develop but surprisingly It moves pretty quickly! Prego!<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>What a gr at spot. I had the market salad and it was fantastic. Fresh and balanced flavors. Others had the pizza and garlic knot and soup and loved it. Can’t go wrong here. The baked goods are especially wonderful. Communal table is fun here as people really do talk with one another and it’s authentic. Definitely come back often for different options.<//Review>< rate>

This place has its act together.  No wait staff robots here.  Exhibition cooking exposing the full kitchen with seating all around.  It's a joy to watch this group in action.

We were right opposite the handmade pizza production. Station 1, sprinkling the paddles with coarsely ground corn, air stretching the road-dimple-sized dough portions to fit the paddle, ladeling a 1 inch wide thin layer of olive oil around the outer region 1" from the edge; then station 2 starting from the inside edge of the olive oil ladeling their tomato sauce to look like the Target logo. Soft Mozzarella cheese chunks are then dropped to for the sauce circles.  Off to station 3 for toppings and then into the oven.  Beautiful to watch the artistry and obvious caring and dedication.

This routine never let up during our 45 minutes.  Yes we had a pizza, mushrooms and fresh arugala.   You will enjoy anything you order.</Text>

I would add this place to the list of my favorite Italian restaurants in LA! Cozy and pretty. Service was outstanding and excellent - I felt really welcomed by the staff when I was there.

Their lunch menu was simple but sincere. We had their Tagliarini and Margherita. The noodles were special and we loved them. Sitting at the bar, we saw the whole process of making and baking the pizza, which was then served directly from the kitchen to our table, and the pizza was just of the kind that would bring one joy.

In addition to all the afore-mentioned, their passionfruit meringue tart stunned me. A symphony of the cloud-like meringue topping, the sour curd, and the crispy buttery pastry - it was more delicious than impressive looking!<//text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>Don't wear your Yeezy's here! Unfortunately my first impression left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The waiting area for a table is quite narrow, it's also the walkway in and out of the restaurant. Low and behold, a 400lb dude stepped on my foot, and it actually hurt, a lot. So ladies, be careful if you're in heels.

Regarding the food, it was actually really good, but you have to order correctly. The garlic knot was really good, but if you let it sit for more than 5 minutes, the bread really soaks up the half-cup of oil that the bread is just sitting in, and caution for the string, it's obviously there and not edible, but it somehow ended up in my mouth. I would recommend the garlic knot.

The mixed mushroom pizza was amazing, so was the pasta and the chicken meatballs, as well as the pound cake dessert.

Staff was amazing, employees were super friendly towards each other, friendly to us, and very helpful in describing what each dish consisted of.

In conclusion, watch out for people stepping on your feet, and order cautiously.<//text>< Pics>

<text>Beautiful place (I would consider it more for dinner though). We went for Sunday brunch (music was a bit louder than I'd like and while the quality is top notch, items on menu are on the heavier-carb side of things). Higher price point than a cafe as an FYI. Good house made granola. Bread is tasty but a bit soft according to my European husband. Regardless, a nice option.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoPC5XtBCmglCMGKPEEQWTVMJRRnmiYqhC4WKl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bb4f73589133:0x35c9170a1addc172</gmap_id></record>

This is one of my favorite pizza places in LA. The minute you walk in, the wonderful smells overcome you and the quaint atmosphere is very charming. The pizza (garlic knot is my fav) is fantastic and the management is very nice. Great for take out for a party or casual night in.  Kid friendly as well. Great location in Santa Monica on Wilshire.  Also, recommend taking home some of their fresh bread which is out of this world good! Only downside is that tables are pretty close so if you don't like that, it may not be good for you. Highly recommend!< /text>

It was slightly on the saltier side and could have been  balanced with a touch more acid, despite having a vinegar butter in it. A great starter nonetheless!

The pizzas were fantastic. That 48 hour crust is nicely crisp on the outside but tears apart easily to reveal a chewy, tasty interior. It's nice to find a neapolitan pizza shop whose meat pizzas aren't exclusively beef- and/or pork-based (though I don't doubt these are also delectable options). Vegetarians also have different a number of pizza options to choose from!

The organic chicken meatball pizza was very good. The bottom of the bottom was finished and crunchy enough to stand up to the heavy toppings. I appreciated that there was more tomato sauce than is usually seen (and arrabiata at that). That being said, we also got the 4-cheese and egg pizza, a white pizza that proved to be a good choice.

Bonus: Their pastries are likely on rotation, but I was able to snag the cheddar apple tarte tatin, a superb soft pastry with a salty-sweet caramelized apple topping. 10/10 would recommend. Even my girlfriend who isn't generally a fan of dessert couldn't stop munching on it.</text>< Rating>

I would add this place to the list of my favorite Italian restaurants in LA! Cozy and pretty. Service was outstanding and excellent - I felt really welcomed by the staff when I was there.

Their lunch menu was simple but sincere. We had their Tagliarini and Margherita. The noodles were special and we loved them. Sitting at the bar, we saw the whole process of making and baking the pizza, which was then served directly from the kitchen to our table, and the pizza was just of the kind that would bring one joy.

In addition to all the afore-mentioned, their passionfruit meringue tart stunned me. A symphony of the cloud-like meringue topping, the sour curd, and the crispy buttery pastry - it was more delicious than impressive looking!<//text>

<review>We sat at the bar and watched them make the pizza up close. Definitely a nice change of pace from sitting at a regular table. The pizza itself was delicious. Something about pizza being cooked in a wood fire oven makes it taste so much better. Suffice to say, we finished the pizza relatively quickly. Def will be back next time we’re in the area.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
We arrived today (Feb. 9) at 3:30, a delightfully quiet time at this very popular restaurant.
We ordered two pizzas, a mushroom and a pepperoni. Pizzas were great. The chocolate brownie dessert was delicious.
Now for the service:  we scanned the restaurant for several minutes for a refill of our lemonades. We asked if we could see our bouncy, pleasant waitress. A worker said she HAD LEFT the restaurant and was done with her shift! What??
We then had to ask twice for refills he’d offered to us.
There were other waits, but luckily I was with a very good friend to share the extra time.
Not sure if this experience will be a deal-breaker, but gosh...</Review>

<Text>Two Words.... Garlic Knots...
Warning don't order those knots on a first date because the garlic is REAL.   Great pizza (thank you pizza oven) and salads.  An ever changing, seasonal menu and interesting wines.  The chef should get a big raise!

I visit this restaurant at least once a month as it is a crowd pleaser.  The menu is not extensive but you will find something that makes you happy.  The baked goods are fantastic.  Another great restaurant to add to the family of Tallulahs, Huckleberry, Rustic Canyon and Sweet Rose!< /Text>< pics>

Probably the best Italian restaurant I've been to in LA. Their gnocchi and tagliarini bolognese are simply perfect. Make sure to get the garlic knot (picture) for an appetizer. And they have fresh squeeze juice, which was the cherry on top.<//text>

<Text>This place has its act together.  No wait staff robots here.  Exhibition cooking exposing the full kitchen with seating all around.  It's a joy to watch this group in action.

We were right opposite the handmade pizza production. Station 1, sprinkling the paddles with coarsely ground corn, air stretching the road-dimple-sized dough portions to fit the paddle, ladeling a 1 inch wide thin layer of olive oil around the outer region 1" from the edge; then station 2 starting from the inside edge of the olive oil ladeling their tomato sauce to look like the Target logo. Soft Mozzarella cheese chunks are then dropped to for the sauce circles.  Off to station 3 for toppings and then into the oven.  Beautiful to watch the artistry and obvious caring and dedication.

This routine never let up during our 45 minutes.  Yes we had a pizza, mushrooms and fresh arugala.   You will enjoy anything you order.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Pizza was pretty good.  Great crust from a very hot oven.  Chicken meatballs were tasty. Watermelon salad and corn soup were nice additions to the meal.  I thought $23 for a 12" pizza was a little steep.  Plenty of yummy looking pastries and artisan breads.< /review>< resp>

Food was delicious. We ordered tagliatelle, pepperoni and mushroom pizza, roasted brussel sprouts and breakfast sandwich. Pizza had a great crispy crust. Kid friendly. We would definitely come back.</Review>

Great pasta dishes, great brick oven European style pizza and really good pastries. Saw a comment about the size of the waiting area that I think is irrelevant as M & O is a small but cozy place with great food and that's enough for me!< /text>

Service was actually very bad. I had to get up multiple times to ask for water and a check on your order. The Arrabiata was excellent, But we found the pizza to be average at best. Sometimes, it’s the service of the restaurant that dictates the overall experience in addition to the food. For us, that was our experience in this particular case. We also had two young children. I would not recommend this restaurant for families.</Text>

Went here about 2 months ago as a part of a group. One of the my friends picked up the tip for the whole group because he had ordered more. Naturally I left no tip only to find out that one of their servers added 25% to it after the fact.

EDIT: There was a change in management (probably a good thing) and the situation was sorted out. I appreciate their efforts to fix things the best they could.</Review>

Hmm... Had a salad. Just a salad right? Incorrect. The steak on it was crispy and juicy with hamburger seasoning that made it. The goat cheese cut through my heart like a tough break-up. Greens and tomatoes so fresh. Avocados woke me up like smelling salt it was so tasty. Listen if the salad's that good imagine how good a slice of pizza must be.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmap_id>

Conveniently located near tennis courts and lots of office buildings where you might do business, the garlic knots and pizzas are awesome.  Thin crusts baked in the oven right before your eyes. I usually get the kale and pork belly pizza and sit at the bar.  Piping hot deliciousness.</Text>

< review>
Ordered the pork belly sausage and kale pizza. We asked our server to have the kale removed, so it was just a pork belly sausage pizza. It was delicious. The tomato sauce was creamy delicious and the sausage was also very tasty. It was a very thin 12" pizza that required folding lengthwise to eat without flopping over. Nothing wrong with that, just trying to give an accurate description. The crust was crunchy and gooey; almost Neapolitan. One pizza should be enough to for an average couple. We also ordered the steak salad...also, delicious. The beef was a bit livery, but tasty. The avocado, tomatoes, and mixed greens were flavorful and had a tasty vinaigrette. The wait staff was helpful and friendly and would acknowledged if they didn't know the answer to something and would get an answer right away. The restaurant is a bit loud and a bit cramped, but it's to be expected for this type of restaurant. We went on a Thursday at about 2pm and it was full, but a couple tables were available. With a glass of wine the total was about $64. I would recommend this place for a casual meal for 1-2 people. They probably can accommodate more people, but given the size and popularity, larger parties should probably call ahead.<//review>

< review>
Don't wear your Yeezy's here! Unfortunately my first impression left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The waiting area for a table is quite narrow, it's also the walkway in and out of the restaurant. Low and behold, a 400lb dude stepped on my foot, and it actually hurt, a lot. So ladies, be careful if you're in heels.

Regarding the food, it was actually really good, but you have to order correctly. The garlic knot was really good, but if you let it sit for more than 5 minutes, the bread really soaks up the half-cup of oil that the bread is just sitting in, and caution for the string, it's obviously there and not edible, but it somehow ended up in my mouth. I would recommend the garlic knot.

The mixed mushroom pizza was amazing, so was the pasta and the chicken meatballs, as well as the pound cake dessert.

Staff was amazing, employees were super friendly towards each other, friendly to us, and very helpful in describing what each dish consisted of.

In conclusion, watch out for people stepping on your feet, and order cautiously.<//review>

<text>The coolest part about this experience is that yes, you really do get your pizza in 90 seconds! It was hot and fresh. The server at the front counter was very friendly. I do feel it's a bit hyped up though, because there just wasn't enough substance to qualify the prices and the cheese wasn't as savory as I had hoped it to be!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Name>Q Sumar (Hey_IamQ)</Name><Time>1581485218496</Time><Rate>4</Rate><review>I was here with a friend for dinner.

We arrived before rush hour and were seated immediately.

I have to say from the start, the staff were excellent! Our waiteress was an absolute pleasure! She knew her menu, the offers and recommended options based on our dietary requirements.

We had the garlic knot, olives and baby leaf salad for starters. The much hyped garlic knot was in my opinion OK. The olives and salad were delicious!

We both had pizza as our main course. The pizza's were very nice although could have had some better mix of flavours. Certain ingredients were overpowering. The parmesan and chilly flakes were medioker.

I'd come back for sure to try the in-house made pasta!</review>< pics>

< Review>
This is a very different yelp of all yelps. My service was great and all credit goes to my server/waiter. He was amazing great and spectacular! The restaurant gets a 2 star because there was not anything on the menu that accommodates vegans.

I’m a new vegan. But Mr. Marcelo was so helpful and tried his best! He brought out these peppers called shishito peppers and they tasted amazing.

Did not fill me up but kept me in the game until I was able to head over to the Erewhon Market. Great tasting wine and again the PEPPERS!! Great taste! Very clean establishment and friendly staff.

Very disappointed in the lack of vegan options but the service is great!</Review>

It's a very nice place. The food is on the pricey side, but food was good. I personally had a breakfast sandwich. I also had a few of their pastries. All where excellent. Price for those is fair. Their coffe bar is good.<//review>

Food: delicious mozzarella pizza, unbelievably expensive meatballs (4 for $15). The price point was higher than the food quality.

Ambiance: upscale yet home-y. Bar-seating is in front of an open kitchen - pretty neat.

Service: great service, our waitress checked up on us frequently.<//Review>

I ordered from postmates and of course they forgot my 3 pizzas I ordered. Milo and Olive didn't have to replace them or throw in the free box of pastries but they did.  The pizza is amazing. The chocolate chip cookies were perfect and crunchy.  The staff was so kind and 3 of them checked in to help or make conversation even though the place was packed.</text>

<Review>This place has incredible food. Absolutely to die for.

I will say I really wish they weren’t so pompous during the table seating process, and added layer of difficulty there with a lack of reservations; it makes having a business meal here very hard.

For pleasure, it’s tolerable enough to deal with the staff.< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

Excellent Italian food, at a reasonable price for Santa Monica standards. The appetizer garlic knots are amazing, and their pasta and pizza are really good as well. Service is friendly and pretty fast. Nice bonus is that a bakery is located within the restaurant, so it's convenient to bring some bread to go after dinner.

Only drawback was that the place is pretty small and crammed, and gets very crowded and loud. Would go back here for the food but not the interior.<//Review>

Great food and really fast service. We got the meatballs, garlic knot, and a margherita pizza -- everything was delicious, but the garlic knot was super cool. They stuff it with cloves of garlic and it's huge and hollow, so it's extra garlicky and amazing!</text>

I’ve only tried the bakery, but I’ve had several items and you can tell the chef really loves their pastries, everything is very well done with the high quality ingredients. The quiche is the only one I’ve had that tastes as good or better than my own. Everything is flaky, buttery, and rich. Unique combinations. Great if you’re into pastries that aren’t as sweet/very little buttercream here. More breakfast style rather than dessert. The only thing I didn’t like are their take of chocolate chip cookies.<//text>

We had coffee, the Breakfast Sandwich ,  Warm 3 Grain Bowl and the Assorted House Baked Bread with fresh jam.
I absolutely love my breakfast sandwich, the scrambled eggs were nice and fluffy and the arugula salad was refreshing. The Warm 3 grain bowl was interesting meld, I liked it but my company did not go crazy for it. The House Baked Bread and fresh jam is a must when visiting. The jam will be something I crave for months to come. The house coffee is okay, a little too acidic for me but still good.< /Review>

Incredible.  2miles, 20 miles, 200 miles, just travel here and ENJOY!

*I wanted to add a personal note.
Early the following AM my husband had a massive heart attack. He walked himself into the ER and they saved his life, he is here today!!! He mentioned once or twice, how this could've been his last meal. Then follows it with,  "it was a damn good one! "

It may be too rich for him to enjoy again any time soon, but cheers to those of you who can and ENJOY!!!<//review>

Super tasty Italian upsclae place that knows how to bake some goodies. The garlic knots is amazing and not your traditional style. It's big perfect crust with soft inside and amazing olize oil and mellowed our cooked garlic. It is excellent. Also had the 4 cheese pizza and was excellent. Great ingredients and cooked just right. The place gets busy but is worth the wait. Nice open kitchen layout. Would definitely go back and recommend this place.< /Text>

The margarita pizza is very tasty, the crust is crispy, need to be consumed  at the restaurant, no very good for take out.
Great food, service tend to be slow.
I dislike the 3%  charged for employees health care.

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>I could go and eat nothing but the garlic knot and still go home happy. Strange item to highlight, but this menu is delicious through and through, and the fact that they've done something so special with an otherwise  delicious but totally forgettable dish is representative of how great this kitchen is. I've tasted 7 or 8 items in two trips and it's universally impressive, from the handmade pastas to pizzas that may just be my favorite on the west side. It's pretty hip, has a warm and energetic atmosphere, with the kind of intimacy you'd want out of a place that you'd bring your closest friends to for a lively evening full of great food, great wine, and great conversation.

Service was top notch, diners felt pretty hip, but definitely had some local families, and prices were medium-high. Highly recommend.</Text><gmapID>0x80c2bb4f73589133:0x35c9170a1addc172<//gmapID></record>

It is a busy place. We sat at one of the community tables. The food is delicious. Waitstaff and other workers friendly. Not cheap but not too expensive. Well worth it especially knowing part of the cost goes towards helping make sure the employees have health insurance. Will definitely be back.<//Text>

This is my new favorite restaurant ever, so sad it’s so far away from home! The ambiance was gorgeous, the food really delicious and the staff super friendly and helpful. We loved everything we ordered, and I feel like any dish would’ve been as good as the last. 13/10 I would go every week if I lived close by.</text>

Enjoyed dinner with friends at Milo & Olive. I had the mushroom pizza and it was fantastic. My friends ordered the margherita pizza and the pepperoni and they loved their pizzas as well.
We also ordered the famous garlic knot and it was outstanding, so was the Bolognese.
As for drinks I recommend the Milo mule!
We will definitely come back!<//text>

Incredible Food, but Adverserial Staff. Was there with 4 people last night, we each ordered, and the food served to all but me... The server gave me an "eye roll" when I motioned him over. I asked him if he forgot about my pizza, and his response was "You never ordered", rather than "I'm so sorry, did I miss your order?" He told me it was my fault for not telling him what I wanted.  I asked him "I was the first one to order.  If you didn't hear me, why would you leave the table and take everyone's order, and not affirm that I did not want something?"  Server got the manager, but she was little help and still made me feel bad about "causing" the situation. It was my birthday. Arrogant, rude staff who spread misery, rather than joy- What a shame.< /Text>

Garlic bread knot was good, but a little bland, nothing salt couldn't take care of. The leftover oil from it is good to use to dip the pizza crusts into. Overall pretty good, but wasn't the best pizzas I've had, but this place seems to have healthier pizzas that are pretty good.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>Milo and Olive is one of my favorite restaurants in Santa Monica. The pizza and pasta is delicious. I usually order a side of marina with my pizza for dipping the crust because their sauce is so good.

Hour plus long wait (my own fault, should have called and ordered ahead). However, if one is waiting for that long, they should really try (and I believe they were, they are just so busy on Fridays sadly) to have a take-out order ready to hand off by the time that was stated, not 15 minutes after the stated time. Still it's worth it, garlic knot (drool) alone. Even after the wait and the car ride home. So worth it.< /review>

Love the chill scene they have going on. Always have the best tasting food not matter when you go. Great for brunch, as they have off menu items during that time. Shrimp Chimmichurri and Garlic Knot are a must try!</Review>

<text>I don't like when everyone raves about a place and says the same thing, "Oh, have the garlic knot." "Gosh, get the garlic knot." "OMG GARLIC KNOT." Well...

Have the garlic knot. It is amazing. You can't make it at home. Try it tonight.

Moving on, the space is tiny, with limited communal seating. Staff is great, but with such cramped conditions, it can be trying. Salads are good, and the wine is lovely. Get the garlic knot.< /text>< pictures>

Nice place with good pizza. The garlic knot was certainly a hit. Wine prices are a bit high but the other pricing is fair. Overall a good spot.</review>

<Review>We are here last night it was terrible pizza. Over rated. Not sure what people see here in their food. Was told a 30 min wait and ended up waiting hour and 15 minutes. Then was told we would have sit in a communal table with other people. I'm here with 4 guest and was never told we would have to share a table. Plus the server was very confused on the orders do to being a communal table. I will say one thing positive is there bread maybe they should stick to that. Would not recommend.< /Review>< resp>

My husband & I were in Santa Monica last weekend. We didn't know where to go for dinner but knew we didn't want to eat in our hotel. Before we left for vacation, I saw a write up about where to eat, shop and sight see in Santa 'Monica in "Coastal Living" magazine (September 2016 issue). Milo & Olive was suggested. We were not disappointed!! The food is fabulous along with the service! I highly recommend! We will return when in the area again!!</Text>

<Review>Milo and Olive is a cute little italian place tucked away on a busy street in Santa Monica - I love the open atmosphere and bustling vibe of the restaurant. It is on the small side, so waiting for a table for a group larger than 3 can be a pain but the staff are extremely nice, accommodating and try to make it as painless as possible. This can definitely be avoided if you don't go during peak hours.

Dishes came out fairly quick and have a clean farm to table palate. Most notable was the garlic knot which is their take on a garlic bread of sorts and is definitely worth a try!<//Review>< Pictures>

I love all things bakery, and I have to say Milo and Olive is like the perfect restaurant for me: there are pizzas, pastas, baked goods, beer, and they're open late! The pizzas are delicious (albeit a tad too greasy), the garlic knot is a flavorful, bready mess, and you can use the remaining garlic as a spread or in other dishes--totally worth it! Definitely try their salads if you visit, both that I've tried were delicious, and even the vegetarian pasta special we tried was amazing. Milo and Olive really does carbohydrates justice, and I would definitely recommend you try it for yourself.< /review>

<Review>Stop #72 for @pizzas365: Milo & Olive has an awesome pizza with fresh, unique ingredients and a decent crust. However, the sauce is too acidic (and doesn't blend with the rest of the pizza), and the price is very high. 4.0 Stars.</Review>< pics>

< review>
Came here on a Thursday night and it was already super packed by around 7:30. There was about a 45 minute wait, but we left our name and moved in towards the back of the restaurant where there was some room to stand and ordered a bottle of wine while we waited. They were super attentive to us while we waited, and even let us order our food while we were still standing in order to have it ready once we sat down because we were in a bit of a rush.

Regarding drinks, we did a bottle of wine even though some of us wouldn't have preferred it, because the cocktails were on the expensive side. I'm from NYC, but $15 for a cocktail with dinner was still a lot, considering with 2 of those you're already at a $30 tab each not including food, tax, tip, etc. The wine was luckily great though, so we were fine with it once we tried it.

The ambiance was super upbeat while still being cozy. The place itself is small and while it was a bit loud (it was super crowded), it still had an intimate feel. The staff was all extremely friendly and accommodating - my friend who we were with is vegan and found limited options on the menu, but they answered all her questions and were able to switch a few things around to make some of the menu items vegan for her.

She ended up getting the gnocchi and my friend and I split the margarita pizza. Both were really good, but also pretty pricey for what it was.

We really liked Milo and Olive, but I wouldn't recommend it for a casual dinner - better for something a little more formal or special just cased on the price! Definitely a lot of menu options I would have liked to try, but the pricing in general dissuaded me from adding sides, apps etc.

Also, wanted to note that they let us (and everyone) know that "A 3% charge is added by the restaurant to all checks to help offer fully covered healthcare to our employees." While I think this is awesome, I don't necessarily think that's what customers should be paying for? Not sure how it works in other restaurants, but I know plenty of servers and bartenders that get full benefits without it being added to customers' bills. Maybe it's worked into the prices in other ways, but I can tell you for sure if the prices had been any higher we would have relocated for what was a casual night out!</review>

Great food, Solid B service, pretty jerk / Beverly Hills-ish pricing.

Ambience is rad, but you can have same quality food with a much  better view for the same price at The Lobster, or same quality food with less ambiance at 1/2 the price down the street.

Their pizza and pasta are both spectacular... As it should be fo what they charge.

Bring your in-laws when they're in town, but not your girlfriend or side chick< /Review>

Horrible waiting staff took over 15 minutes to order food and 5 minutes just to get a Coke. Once the food arrived it was soggy and way to hot to pick up and place my mouth. Had took speak to one of the managers there it was so bad. You may think I had only one bad experience but if your looking for pizza or good Italian food in Santa Monica this isn't the place for it. Others told me about their experiences at Milo and Olive.

<text>Missing taste buds? This place is for you!
I wish I had taken pictures of guests' faces when they set these strange dishes on the table. The most awkward sight and taste I've ever encountered. Seriously, if you can serve sausage without flavor, you had to work hard to do it. Yes, the pork had no flavor. The garlic knot was a giant heap of burnt bread with garlic cloves tucked on the middle, served in a bowl of oil. They should use that garlic to flavor the food. What Italian place lacks garlic and salt?! This place. I spent over $50 for the two of us to be disappointed. Maria's has better bolognese and the garlic bread is free... Just a few blocks away.<//text>< time>

3 adults, 1 kid, no appetizers, no leftovers, no alcohol was over $100. Some charges were tacky like $3 for a very small side of ranch dressing in a paper cup. For $23 a side of ranch should be complimentary, or at least an ample amount.

I visited with 2 other adults and a small child. After ordering the two other adults were served their food, small portions of pasta that cost over $20 a plate, I was served a pizza 15 minutes later, and 4 year old didn't get his food until the adults were basically finished eating.

Solid food but too small a weird vibe. The place is always packed and although the service is good it seems like the staff thinks its a privilege for you to eat there. they wont tell you wait times and if youre indecisive they seem to get impatient.< /text>

<review>The food is amazing and the service is great. The woodfired pizzas are to die for. Had a special ravioli today. Walnuts and Brown butter!  Crazy good. The only downside is the wait. There is always a wait and there is not a lot of places to sit and wait.  You can sit outside on one of two benches .< /review>< pics>

Great beers and wines by the glass (or bottle).

Desserts always so tempting, whether the ones on the menu or from the Huckleberry bakery case. Coffee from Café Luxxe.

Wait staff is friendly, though curiously difficult to get their attention sometimes.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1512577139879, 'text': 'Diego, thanks for the compliment!

<rating>4< /rating><Review>A great vibe, perfect for date night or catching up with friends. It took a little while for a party of two to get seated but it was worth the wait.

::Food::
- GARLIC KNOTT!!!! It was amazing and perfect for foodies who likes to take pics. The garlic hit the spot, the bread soaked everything up.
-Arugula Salad: I'm going through a phase where I crave for arugula. This was amazing, I don't mind getting one order and finishing it on my own. The portion was large enough to share between the two of us and get seconds.
- Pork Pizza, wasn't disappointing. I think I was expecting more fattiness, but it was ok.

::Parking:: I found street parking, make sure to read the signs!

:: Service:: I liked how attentive they were even though it was super busy.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Solid pizza!

We ordered the roasted butternut squash, garlic knots, margherita pizza, four cheese and egg pizza. The four cheese and squash were the best dishes for sure.

Only disappointing thing was how surprisingly small the beers were - they were like wine pours!<//Review>

Like the pizza is delicious because they ha e this amazing tomato sauce but it overpowers any ingredient you put on it so the tomato sauce is overwhelmingly the star.  So it's not worth it to get pizza with toppings.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Absolutely fantastic, relaxed, NY-ish, vibey. Everything was top: the service, the food (we had the burrata & prosciutto pizza), the iced coke, the chai latte and the music (The Cure, Prince, MJ, etc). Less than $20/person for a party of 3 sharing 2 pizzas (lots of food). Even when it was packed they sat everyone very fast and very kindly. Will return many times we hope!<//review>

The place serves decent pizza and appetizers. Vibe is very santa monica like. The crowd and noise level is not worth the quality and price of food.</Review>

The meatballs - amazing. I wish I could recreate this at home!
The garlic knot - my friends still talk about it
The pizzas! - They offer specials that are imaginative and creative (cauliflower pizza was on point). They also have some favorites that are well executed.
The baked goods are also delicious and available to take home.

Postmates will deliver! Expect to wait, ive been here for both lunch and dinner at "off hours" and we had a glass of wine while waiting for a spot to open up. Again it is worth it!</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
This place was on my bookmarks list but I forgot about it until we were in the neighborhood and starving.  I was so happy that it ended up being a really good decision to come here!

Arugula salad- the salad was good but some bites were REALLY salty I think due to the anchovy?
Garlic knot- omg SOOO GOOD.  The outside was perfectly crispy and inside so soft.  I thought it would be super garlicky and I was skeptical, but after taking one bite I was in love.
Pasta ribbon- probably the worst dish of the selections.  I didn't really like the pesto and it was really bland.  Probably could've done without this dish because we had soo much food.
Pork belly sausage and kale- This was really yummy!  I loved the dough.

Best part about it?  WE SAW CONAN O BRIEN THERE EATING WITH HIS FAMILY!!!</review>

<review>Hi everyone! I want to share our recent experience in hope none of you have to go through the staff's harrassment we did. Me and my girlfriend had lunch here last August and had a very unpleasant experience with the staff, specially  the kitchen staff was gawking at us and made us feel very uncomfortable. At some point my girlfriend pass by and the kitchen staff made tacky noises to her. Also of the waiters will keep on asking our social media information over and over again. We did not enjoyed our meal like we wanted to. Another important event is that I personally complain to management and we did not recieved response. So they are not taking this unacceptable behavior seriously. We only hope none of you expirience this by coming to this place.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>If you want a solid pizza in LA you have to visit Milo and Olive, the ingredients are fresh and the crust has just the right crisp!

My wife and I rode bikes here from Hermosa beach so we were more than hungry! We shared the FELINO SALAME & ROASTED RED PEPPER and not only were we impressed we were full for the 2+ hour bike ride back.

Also just want to note that I totally think it is awesome that they charge 3% to ensure their employees have healthcare. It is such a small cost on the customer but goes a long way for their staff!</text><gmapID>0x80c2bb4f73589133:0x35c9170a1addc172</gmapID><UserId.>105621063089646881490<//UserId.><time>1531737506717</time>< Rate>

Would you like to smell like garlic for the next 3 days? Order a garlic knot, wonderfully fluffy and garlicy, and warm. Cocktails are low alcohol (beer and champagne-based), but the beer list is worth looking at.< /text>

<text>Busy. Communal tables in front, never know if you will be next to a family with little kids, business people, a young couple or an old, and if that's not your cuppa there are some small tables and counter seating. Pizzas are very good, lemonade is great, smaller plates are ok and overpriced, staff is generally friendly and relatively attentive.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1507045761506, 'text': 'Edward, we appreciate your feedback, as being friendly and attentive is what we are known for!

Everything that came to the table was remarkable. The garlic knot is a must, as is the sautéed kale--believe it or not. By way of pizza: I'd hit the crispy pepperoni and housemade pork belly sausage. Seating can take a while, even through the week, so be prepared to wait.<//Review>

< Review>
A Definition of gastro serendipity...Milos and Olive in Santa Monaca.
Taking a walk on a summer evening walked into this delight for a quick bite.

I could smell the fresh artisan breads wafting through the rustic communal
restaurant...this is what I found:

Fresh warm ricotta cheese with drizzled olive oil and pepper. Roasted stone
fruit and toast points. Wood fired Pizza, Balsamic Base with cubed pork belly
and Peaches from the market.

I will be back. to praise the  staff and owners. What a delight</Review>

Really enjoyed my meal here. I liked their porkbelly sausage pizza, garlic knot, however the arugula salad I got was a bit salty for my taste, and I do not recommend their pesto pasta? It was average at best

I recommend that everyone get a pizza and a garlic knot.

I recommend going early as there will be a long line. Our order of salad, pasta, pizza,two drinks came out to 100 bucks.

We also saw Conan o brien dining with the fam here. I had to stop my gf from asking for a picture lol.<//review>

My pizza, burrata and parma was super salty and oversauced. The crust was tasty. The corn soup was good but comes in a big bowl even though the server said it was small. Hrm.< /text>

Food is good, but the servings are ridiculously small, at least given the prices. Be prepared to leave either hungry or poor!</review>

A Definition of gastro serendipity...Milos and Olive in Santa Monaca.
Taking a walk on a summer evening walked into this delight for a quick bite.

I could smell the fresh artisan breads wafting through the rustic communal
restaurant...this is what I found:

Fresh warm ricotta cheese with drizzled olive oil and pepper. Roasted stone
fruit and toast points. Wood fired Pizza, Balsamic Base with cubed pork belly
and Peaches from the market.

I will be back. to praise the  staff and owners. What a delight< /Text>

I hear they go to Italy on the regular to learn a few tricks. They have not been falling asleep in class. Expensive, but not like similar bigger fancier Beverly Hillish type places that somehow don't catch the authenticity but rather go for over the top pizzaz. These guys center on freshness, authentic taste, with a limited menu. I would rate them second next to Pinquini in  Playa. Remember I do not eat ANY fast food, and I am an Italian from Italy that has been languishing here for decades waiting for the savages to understand cuisine. All I can say is: Finally!!  Much like Madeline Kahn when she finally found it in "Blazing Saddles" lol<//text>

<Text>This place rocks every part of the menu, but especially the salads (the Milo chopped is a favorite), the soups (cauliflower bisque) and the pizzas. The pizzas are can't miss and are simply delicious. It gets busy at night and with no reservations, you may have to wait a bit. But it'll be worth it.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Although they are recommended I felt it was a bit over priced for what was provided. Also not so many options for vegetarian folks. Not sure I would go again.< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Delicious pizza !!! We had lunch on a Saturday, around 13:30 and did not expect anything, we were promptly attended. The restaurant is small, the service is excellent. Has chairs for children and changing table in the bathroom (for those who have baby, changing table is worth gold !! :)
I ate dessert a hot cake with whipped cream and strawberry, delicious !!! And the price is nothing salty !! Oh, and I didn't find the environment noisy
