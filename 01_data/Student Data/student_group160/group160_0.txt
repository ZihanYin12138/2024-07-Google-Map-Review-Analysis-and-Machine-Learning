<Text>This was my first time trying homemade Ugandan food and it was wonderful! I loved the peanut sauce covered plantains, greens, spiced rice, chicken stew and cassava. I'll have to take a friend or two there next time. The hospitality was great as well.
Hints: don't walk down the alleyway like I did because the house is on the right of it. You're served the house special and an aromatic black tea, so there are no menus to choose from... just sit down in the kitchen and you'll be waited upon.

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>(FOR PASADENA LOCATION) I've been trying to get my hands on a Howlin Ray's chicken sandwich for years now, but was never willing to wait in 2-3 hour lines just for food. They recently opened up a second location in Pasadena which gave me more incentive to finally try it (that location doesn't have a yelp page).<//review><response>None< /response>< username>

This charming eatery in the backyard of an unassuming home is a delight. Our dining group was thrilled with the food (we highly recommend the goat stew!) and with how our hostess guided us through the selection process. Show up hungry!</Review>

<Text>This was the first time that I've had East African food, or Uganda food. After looking this place up on Yelp, I decided to give it a try. And man, was I surprised. The food was awesome. Very fresh and homemade quality. I had the chicken pilao rice with matooke, greens, chapati, and goat meat stew. All of it was great, and the flavors were so different. I loved the pilao rice because it was a very feel good food. The matooke had the most awesome peanut sauce on top of it. Just outstanding. And the chaptai was fresh made, kind of reminds of Chinese scallion pancakes. And the goat meat stew, wow!

If you are looking to try some great African food in LA, give this place a shot. It's a hidden gem in Van Nuys, and shouldn't be missed. What's also unique is that this food service operates out in Jalia's house, so seating is outdoors in the backyard. It makes you feel like you're in the wilderness of Africa!

I shot a YouTube video of my experience at Jaliz Cuisine, which you can find on my YouTube channel called Rockstar Eater.<//Text>< Date>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>The CEO and Chef of Jaliz Cuisine, Jaliah, has been a family friend since I was a kid. I used to enjoy attending functions she hosted because I could always count on the food to be 💯💯.

Her cooking and food have only gotten better since then. When I bite into a Chapati (my favorite item on the menu) from Jaliz Cuisine, it transports me back to my favorite Chapati street-cart in Uganda.

Lastly, I LOVE that she prepares the food with FRESH and REAL ingredients. I highly recommend Jaliz Cuisine if you're looking to get an AUTHENTIC taste of Uganda.<//review>< pics>

It was a terrific experience on so many levels, the food, the fact that you are in her home, the tea she served (never had anything like it, it was spicy, so great) and the service. Jaliz invited us into her home, we sat in her dining room while she cooked amazing food for us in her kitchen, it felt like care.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Eat the World LA review:
I first came to Van Nuys for Ugandan food when I was still a New Yorker. I randomly searched for some foods we did not have while on trips to Los Angeles, and came across Jaliz by chance. Because it seemed to have a profile online, I was a little baffled when we arrived at what seemed to be a simple home. We live in an amazing world. On a residential street of Van Nuys, there is a somewhat secret, or at least hidden, chef from Uganda offering her skills to East Africans in the area. Everyone missing those tastes from back home seems to know about it. The backyard is full of random couches and tables, pick your favorite and enjoy a little taste of East Africa. Since it was our first time, she promised us a little bit of everything, and delivered on that 100%.
°
The menu will be different each day, so show up with an open mind and let the chef take you where she wants. On this day there were two different meat stews, which each came out with an entire heaping plate of sides and chapati. Better than even the food here was the experience. Being welcomed into someone's home and receiving such a beautiful meal all while East African life in the area swirled around was one of the highlights of a trip. It will be nice to live closer and stop in once in a while to see what's new.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Unique place.  Not a normal restaurant setting.  It's in a home, but the food was excellent!  Bathroom was....er... interesting and tiny.  Go for the fo li d experience, but dont expect much atmosphere.</review>

<review>Vibe Organic Kitchen serves the most beautiful food I have ever eaten, and ALL of it is organic, gluten free, and vegan. This is mind blowing to me. I’m not vegan, but I do have to order gluten free, vegan foods because my daughter is allergic to dairy and eggs. Thus, I found Vibe Organic Kitchen and gave it a try! The Cobb Salad, the Macro Bowl, the Taco Fiesta Toast, and the Avocado Toast are incredible! I ordered these items every day. The colorful, beautiful food could turn me into a vegan if I lived here. Truly excellent! Thanks for your spectacular, delicious food, Vibe!< /review>< Rate>

<Date>1620743143561<//Date><Text>I stopped in here to use the bathroom after taking my pup to the dog park across the street. This is place is entirely vegan/organic/macro, which I didn't even realize till after I was eating my cookie in the parking lot after.  My very basic smoothie was 10 bucks and the frozen mango chunks they used (organic frozen mango chunks I hope!) were not blended into the smoothie, which is pretty much smoothies 101, so 1 star off for that.  The parking lot is behind and on top of the building, drive past it for the entrance. Food looked healthy and interesting.</Text><GmapID>0x80dcf1dda3ff9963:0x4f8b3102f2ea3182<//GmapID>< Pics>

We tried the breakfast bowl, macro bowl, and Mediterranean bowl. All were a fantastic flavorful dance on our taste buds. My non vegan family wasn't missing the meat at all. They have sparkling water free on tap which I thought was an amazing touch. Staff was friendly. I don't think you can go wrong with any of their dishes. I saw people eating the tacos and they looked so good im going to try them next time. They also have smoothies, juices, and burgers. Everything is plant based and vegan. Im so grateful this place exists. It's hour away from me but I will definitely be going back!< /Text>

< Review>
I want to first start off by saying thank you to the staff Chance and all the employees that work at vibe thank you. The greeting and the energy when you come in the establishment is top-notch. Quality of food here is it 15 out of 10. I got some of the quinoa bowls but by far our favorite is the frittata breakfast burrito the sauce on that burrito is excellent so good you could drink it it does have a little bit of heat though so careful I recommend this establishment for healthy lunchtime and dinner options they also have smoothies and juices it's a great way to get in shape and shed a few pounds and also eating healthy organic vegan options.

thank you VIBE CAFE, I'll see you soon.<//Review>

Absolutely delicious!  I was extremely pleased and surprised how amazing plant based food (all vegan) can taste!  So good! I'm gonna have to come back.  ...a little pricey but totally worth it!!  Kale chips are phenomenal! Their jackfruit burrito is my fave! Chunky Monkey smoothie yummy!</review>

Anytime we’re in south OC we have lunch at Vibe! Their bowls, burritos and burgers are amazing. I ordered Buddha Burger and sweet potato fries with a chipotle crema.
We love their vegan, gluten free cookies are yummy too!! 💯😋</Text>

<time>1613505353723< /time><review>I can’t believe how yummy and healthy the food is here.  I eat organic WFPB (whole-food-plant-tbased) food, so must do most of my own cooking.  Vibe is such a treat.  I can order anything on the menu without worry.  And the staff is so friendly!  Vibe ROCKs!  Will come here often.  So many great looking items to try...< /review>< Rate>

I'm over here trying to order online and I'm looking at their menu to see SERVED ALL DAY: TOAST. I try to order it and it says this item is not available for delivery. I check the smoothies and it says SMOOTHIES NOT AVAILABLE FOR DELIVERY. What the heck?? What type of place is this? Dont be lazy and put all of your items on your delivery list or dont deliver at all.

I ordered a mushroom and chorizo taco plate. It was so so. Definitely not restaurant quality. Wont be ordering from here again.<//text>

My vegan burger was very good and the acai bowl was great. It's a little expensive. We order to go and they needed a lot of time to have it ready.< /review>

<text>Really great food and service. We had the Macro bowl and Mediterranean bowl plenty of food so ask for a lid. The juices were fresh and yummy ; spicy green is super good not that spicy , and Chunky Monkey is great it was a perfect dessert drink.

They have Yellowbird sauce and it’s yummy, non are super spicy . They have plenty of self serve water and soon sparkling water. Would definitely come back with friends . I have been waiting for while and I was not disappointed!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNC5sn3V8B-HxSgan1Ywg_8WuVK9WjKMBz7isGe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4Rph10hfLuiTkCH_KQg9DTCpqEEwxbpd1WBPm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNP5uqBxiMLB17-bO0TOzdQ_b4CIg49xnw3DiRJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKYgRnPSlXWwPc__aE77rpl45eNOrkBrYYiwRN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN59ldUBsbzif-zNCoYp2lDBWwhqUwVwVvO72nN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVFclzPR6akQ_7Cv3Bscfii9G-yizlbTKZ-SJt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

One of the best, healthiest places to eat in Dana Point. My friend introduced me to this little hideaway in plain sight. She had the Macro bowl and I dug into a Fiesta bowl. The jackfruit carnitas were so yummy and I found a new favorite kombucha as well (try pear).

Whole-hearted and delicious! Attention to detail—they pull out all the stops with flavors and presentation.  So happy to see these little craft-style places cropping up in Orange County.

Next up, breakfast!< /text>

Stopped in as the Aussie Bean next door was closed. Although it's not their mainline, Aussie Cat at Vibe went out of his way to whip up a cold brew, which was fab. Hit the spot. Why, I dunno, maybe I looked haggard, but refused to charge me for the iced coffee and ice water. Left him a tip. One never forgets kindness such as his, and super drinks and menu!</review>

The salads are huge, I have never finished mine and it makes for a great dinner.  Their hot sauces are also delicious!

never have been to a more healthy, delicious, organic, and overall AMAZING vegan restaurant! I have been vegan for a while and I know how hard it can be to create healthy yet good tasting recipes. Not only is the food here delicious, but it truly is healthy and not loaded with oil, salt, or sugar. It’s all in moderation. There smoothies and juices are to die for. I love the energizer bunny and the chunky monkey. The vibe of this place is kind of like Active Culture but BETTER; it’s all plant based, the smoothies are better, and the people are actually NICE :)< /Review>

Organic vegan? Rad but.....  To go containers only? Creating unnecessary waste is the problem. Will not spend a dime here until eco moves are made. Bye guys. I hope the people reading this demand conscious environmental options. Cheers.< /Review>

Food is really great! 5 Star great. But the music level is intolerable on the weekends. Literally, painful.  If you want a chill vibe to go with chill good food, I recommend going on weekdays. And no, I'm not old.</text>

This place has the most creative dishes of any vegan restaurant I've ever been to, and they're all delicious. The Buddha Burger is my go-to, Macro Bowl is a close second. On the weekends, the Chicken (cauliflower) & Waffles are unbeatable.< /Review>

Love, Love, Love this place.
Looking for clean, healthy, tasty, filling, feel good food? This is THE place in SoCal area.
We used to go to the NP location but since the opening of this new DP location, we are now regulars.

Try the Turmeric shot, Mediterranean Bowl, Burger, Fiesta Bowl (if you like it spicy) on cauliflower rice.

Also great for breakfast. The Waffles are yummy.

Oh... and all this tasty food is 100% organic. Gluten Free. Dairy Free. Soy Free. And Vegan.  WOW!< /review>

Known to be deleterious to human health it is devoid of nutrients indigestible and actually damages you if you eat it.<//Review>< pics>

Every health aware person has to check out Vibe. I literally didnt know where to start because they had so many healthy options! I got their Mediterranean bowl with all greens, added tumeric-kraut, with the tahini on the side. So yummy and definitely two meals for most I want to say. Its clean inside and very open which is nice. The staff was very kind and informative, letting me take my time and didnt rush me which was nice when there was so much to absorb. I even bought some fun drinks to go to try for later. I cant wait to come back and try all the gluten free choices like their sourdough!! :D Thank you for a yummy, healthy dinner 😁< /text>< gmap_id>

I am a TOUGH CUSTOMER!! I suffer from psoriasis due to some health issues that I am currently working on fixing. At this point my skin only flares up when I eat gluten, cane sugar, soy, dairy, maple syrup, and meat products. So VIBE is a great place for me. I admit it’s more expensive than I would like but it’s worth it for me, as I hardly can eat anything. Usually at a restaurant I can eat maybe one or two items, at best, but at VIBE I actually have options! Best bang for your buck is a bowl. Not only that but everyone is helpful. I used to just order on postmates before I had a car and one time the order was incorrect (I could hear it was busy on the phone) anyway the manager DROVE to our place to give us the right order. Really was above and beyond for me. Maybe it isn’t everyones cup of tea but I would rather spend extra money on food that doesn’t bother me than have embarrassing skin issues and pay for expensive creams. I’ve since gone in to the location and it’s really chill.< /review>

<time>1580420467954< /time><rate>2< /rate><text>I frequent Vibe often because they have an amazing menu of food, smoothies and juices however every time I have been disappointed in their service. I have tried calling in my order, ordering online and walking in. Each time it has taken an extremely long time for my order. I have been in there when it was empty and I’ve been in when it was busy and either time the speed in which I get my order is beyond frustrating. I waited 30 minutes before for a kids quesadilla and today I waited 35 minutes for 2 smoothies and a juice.
Great food but just be prepared to wait a painstakingly long time for the food!< /text>< Pics>

Best vegan whole food plant based restaurant in Dana Point.
Vibe Organic has delicious healthy food and an amazingly friendly and helpful staff that cooperates with each other and clients.
I highly recommend this place for locals as well as vegan visitors staying at the nearby Monarch Bay Resort, Ritz Carlton, and Montage.<//text>

<Text>The way plant based food should be. Not trying to imitate animal based favorites. But instead creating delicious dishes with healthy plant ingredients only. And not vegan that can tend to be unhealthy with too much oil, salt, sugar, etc. Well done.</Text><Time>1569694833387< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80dcf1dda3ff9963:0x4f8b3102f2ea3182<//Gmap_id>< Name>

<text>Vibe is opening in Dana Point, and will be the best new restaurant in South OC! We are big fans of the Fiesta Bowl & the Chunky Monkey Smoothie! The Tacos are amazing as well.  It’s so refreshing to eat healthy food that tastes great and makes you feel good!</text>< pictures>

Worker was rolling her eyes at me and then waited 5+ to give me my meal after it had been sitting there being ignored while new FRESH orders we being given out 1st. I'm heavily disappointed that a new restaurant with such a  good idea behind it is failing to provide decent customer service.<//Text>

Closes FAR too early on weekends and they don't have hours on their exterior.

Burrito was overcooked and dry, and overpriced for the quantity food.</Review>

<Date>1622402722972< /Date><Text>I have been usually sorely disappointed in vegan restaurants like this, as they usually try and focus on nutrition, and not taste. My motto is always to be nutritious AND delicious, and boy, this place has thankfully mastered both! The layers of flavors are absolutely sumptuous, and the textures of crispy, chewy, creamy are done incredibly well. I was so blown away by their food, and of course will be returning. Try the curry bowl!! And of course, please support vegan businesses, they are putting in far more effort for the health and well being of the Earth, and all sentient precious beings.</Text><userid>105318229910597224757<//userid>< Gmap_id>

Sorry if this is a little long but this shop is fantastic.  MY cell phone went dead and I had insurance on it, but with a deductible. I went thru 3 days of  phone calls and run around with them trying to get them  to replace the battery and see if  that fixed the issue (this would be free under my  plan).    No all they would do was send me a refurbished replacement phone, after I paid the $200 deductible and sent them my broken phone.  They could not say what kind of phone it  would be.  I like my old  phone and did not want to change it, but I was stuck unless I wanted to fork out $800-$1200 for  a new phone.  I found Love 2 Fix on line and went into the shop.
Immediately upon talking to Chris I felt better and knew I had found a better solution and felt much better.  Everyone in the shop was professional and very helpful.  Chris was super knowledgeable not only about phones and electronics but also about the insurance companies for these cell phone carriers.  Once my phone was fixed (for less than my deductible) my cell phone carrier started having trouble activating it back onto my account.  I went back into Love 2 Fix and Eric helped me call into the cell company, get a real person on the phone, provided me with all the crazy numbers off my phone that the cell phone guy kept asking for.  The process took a long time and Eric stayed at least a half hour after he was supposed to get off just to make sure I could get the phone activated properly.
So just to summarize, the employees and work done by everyone at Love 2 Fix was awesome and greatly appreciated by me.  After years of paying into an insurance plan, all they would do was charge me a deductible just to send me a refurbished phone.  In the future rather than pay $20-$40 a month for phone insurance I will just put away a few dollars when I can and if I have an issue I will just take it in to Love 2 Fix.</Review>

<review>The owner of Love 2 Fix is amazing. I had my phone fixed at another phone repair shop in Arden Mall called Custom cases and the phone screen they replaced my phone with was defective. The screen completely turned black within two and half weeks later. When I went back into the Arden store they said that I would have to pay for a another replacement. Although it clearly states on their vendor policy as well and the store policy that there is a warranty but Custom Cases defense was that it isn't covered because it has physical damage.( mind you my phone had no physical damage they just claimed that it was). Warranty does not cover the phone screen if  there is physical damage. I went home and called other repair shops and Love2fix was the most helpful. The owner Chris went out of his way to diagnose my phone as well as guiding me for facts to take back to the Arden store. He diagnosed my phone with no physical damage and I was able to take it back and have it replaced with a higher quality screen for free. Chris had no obligation to help me but he did anyway. Not only did he diagnose my phone but he also wrote a statement of fact to take back to the other store to have my phone fixed under warranty for free. He was kind and helpful and I am extremely grateful.<//review><Name>Kaisala Togiai</Name></record>

But if you want service with a smile, fair up front pricing, honesty and timeliness then  go anywhere but here. There are lots of places around.

These guys are the best! I was so impressed by the price, quality and great customer service in this place! My kiddos always take my phone therefore repairing cracked screen is nothing new to me. This time I went in because my daughter dropped my phone and it was not displaying anything, plus the screen was cracked. I went to few other places before where I was charge unreasonable amount of money for repair and for a cheap plastic screen protector, I hated it ! Here my great experience started when I called there. The owner/manager was so helpful, he gave me a quote that was very reasonable and said it could be fixed in 30 min. When I got there everyone was so chill and nice. You can tell they have pros working there )) they fixed my phone in no time. I walked out with brand new looking phone. I was very happy and would recommend them to everyone! Good job guy! Keep up the good work !< /review>

Company is prohibited from accepting payments on eBay for engaging in numerous fraudulent transactions. Went outside of eBay. Ordered screen protectors. Never received after two weeks. Company said they shipped them. No tracking number provided. Company refuses to accept responsibility. Should have listened to the eBay reviews. Stay far away.

{'time': 1608602983930, 'text': "I am glad that you copied and pasted your review so we could copy and paste out reply.\n\nI would just like to say that you leaving a review like this is absolutely childish and full of misinformation.\n\nThere is no such hold on our account for accepting payments, but there is an issue with certain zip-codes that happen from time to time, but we work with eBay to see what those are and will still offer to sell out items to customers who want to reach out to us outside of eBay like you did. You wanted the multi-pack of screen protectors for your older phone and were offered two forms of shipping. The first would be free per the eBay posting and consists of a bubble mailer that we put postage on and drop in the mail. This first option has no tracking available as it has stamps on it and is dropped off with the normal mail. The second option was going to be a priority mail flat rate box with USPS or a fed-ex express shipment which would have a tracking number as well as 2 day expedited shipping. You were notified of the two options up front and went with the cheapest option, understandable in your case.. With all the problems that USPS is having with their mail centers and the sorting issues we cannot guarantee the estimated shipping times that they give us since there is nothing we control about the shipment aside from getting it in the mail that same day as purchase.\n\nFor you to refuse to upgrade for tracking and then imply that there should be one by default when our original agreement did not include one is very irresponsible as you are attempting to mislead other consumers with the greatly exaggerated and unfair review. Also using threats of reviews like that to try and get your demands makes you seem untrustworthy to start with.\n\nWe try to make everything as clear as possible up front with our sales and services, but when you fail to understand/comprehend or don't like the outcome from your choices, don't try to point the blame away from yourself. Happy holidays and look forward to USPS delivering whenever they feel like it. :)"}<//response>

<resp>{'time': 1608872188029, 'text': 'You called us on the phone today and said that you had a broken camera lens. We quoted you the price for lens only replacement. We noticed upon opening the device that there was signs that liquid had been inside the device. We replaced the lens for you because that was what you had requested initially. When you came back we notified you that the camera was damaged in addition to the lens that was damaged. You were given the price for camera replacment in addition to lens and then you started to insist that we fix "the whole thing" and that we work with you on this.  My manager on site at the time offered you a discount on a combination of lens and camera replacment and gave you a few options on what we could do to take care of you since it was after closing when you decided to try and discuss different services. You were refusing what we were offering so we also gave the option to reverse the work that was done and refund you minus the shop minimum for the time spent repairing and returning the device to it\'s original condition.  We tested your device and got the work done so it could be picked up as soon as possible for you, you decided to change what we had discussed over the phone earlier in the day after we had completed the work you requested. If you had specified up front that the whole camera had issues as opposed to just the glass ypu would have been quoted and entirely different process for repair. We could have gotten the repair done for you all together, but you were trying to insist that we repair the whole device for less than half of one repair. If you would like to get the device serviced in the future feel free to call us again or send a message with the full details of the device and we can get an accurate quote of what the repair would cost.'}< /resp>< GmapID>

My responses are based on factual information so everyone can have context because were a small business there are no robots to say sorry or thank you. Not a game as you say. Your name doesn't match your ticket but I just realized your the very impatient yoga customer demanding the battery be the only issue, We rigorously tested that device and found the battery to not be the only fault. Your upset that we warned you it would not be a same day service if so and that it would take some time to look at since our queue was quite full. I know you had already set a ticket with the device to send it to Lenovo but unfortunately we did let you know we may need to take some time to find a alternative way to get the device to boot. I know you had information you needed off that laptop urgently as you stated so clearly. But trying to charge the battery as you demanded did not work as the clear issue was the Motherboard of the yoga. We notified you as soon as all options for your time frame were exhausted. You can call us scammers all you would like but when we lay our a clear expectation and you dont listen to those recommendations and try to demand another outcome that wont change what is and isnt correct. Personally I checked that device over with a fine tooth comb until the problem was found and you were just not having any explanation then what you thought was correct. Apologies but tried it your way and that didn't work. When i notified you of the alternatives you demanded to pick it up and when you got here still for some reason questioned why it was not fixed or charged for you to retrieve your data. When there were 3 clear conversations about the options outcomes and all present information was given to you. Lastly not sure who this friend of yours is but if they have any issues whatsoever as everyone has the right to they can contact me directly and ill make it right. On this one sir you are very much on the side of disregarding the information of a decades long experience for no reason other then to satisfy your own anger at the manufacturers defect you experienced. Hope you have a better day!"}<//Response>

I came across there phone sales on offer up. I am a nurse and needed a temporary phone to use for a month. I went to the shop bought the phone, within the next day the screen was not working. I took it multiple times to get fixed they said the screen was fine. Once again I went in I had cracked the screen paid more for them to fix it due to the screen already having issues. They told me I could possibly switch phone out for another phone. I drove to carmichael over six times and phone was never fixed. There technician was out of town for days before letting me know any updates on phone. I'm going The owner Christian got on the phone stated "I'm not going to be playing games" if you want it fixed pay another 100 after paying 160 for a iPhone 6 plus. Then he hung the phone up in my face. I would have just picked up the phone and bought a new one or paid extra for a different one. I've never met a owner with such bad representation of his buisness. I recommend going to smart shop, and I recommend we give buisness to good respectful human beings.< /Text>

A friend of mine referred them to me and I took my phone in and they told me it would be a couple of days to get the parts I needed. Lo and behold they called me the next day and told me my phone was ready! They were able to tack on my part to an overnight order they already had.

Don't generally leave reviews, but this place definitely deserves two thumbs up. One for excellent service, and one for excellent customer service. Talked to Chris, who was super knowledgeable and super friendly. They are a little bit on the pricey side, but it IS WORTH THE MONEY! They do excellent work, and get it done quick.<//Review>

L-O-V-E this shop!  Beat out 2 other shops by far.  My problem: new phone, no techy skills and nobody to help.  They corrected what the salesperson did wrong.  Got my phone up and running and ready to go.  What normally takes me 3 weeks of errors and loss of sanity they had my phone ready in an afternoon.  They are super!  Highly recommend them.  I'm VERY happy with their work!👍< /Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1602197257925, 'text': "Our initial estimate for repairing your PS4 was around $100 due to the issues you described when you first came in. What you failed to realize is that was an estimate based sole on your description before our findings. Turns out Your son had spilled milk on the device and insisted that none had gotten inside-- nonetheless, we needed to open up the device to see if this was actually the case. Our policy for liquid damaged devices is to charge up front $59.99 for the board wash so we and our customers can be completely certain there isn't any lingering liquid or corrosion after the repair. In our initial testing, we found it was overheating and would consistently crash after just a few minutes at the main menu. Upon opening the device we discovered that milk had indeed gotten in the unit and on the board. We immediately reached out to you with this information and you approved the board wash and deep cleaning service at $59.99. Which today you declined you ever spoke with us so we pulled the logs and confirmed times and dates with you. Weird. With units that are this damaged there is a lot of work that needs to be done to them to even get to the point of fully assessing them to make sure they fully function. You brought the unit in for power issues and running slowly but throughout our testing we found your PS4 had board damage, power supply issues, a failing hard drive, a jammed fan and a very dusty heat sink. We gave you the new quote for the repairs and you understandably wished to cancel the repair. We undid all the work we did and were just going to charge you the remaining $20 balance for the board wash service which you had approved and was already completed. This did not even include the almost 10 hours of labor that went into the testing and work that we put into the unit. We did not release the PS4 to you because you wanted to argue the pricing of a service that we had done with your approval. Also demanded more money back because we followed our timeline with liquid damage and told you it could take some time. You called the police expecting them to honor your demands after you protested and stated you wouldn't leave, We allowed this childish behavior and let you cool off, after which you called the police and unfortunately as you even stated The police came in to hear both sides of the argument and to explain the situation to you. We would have 100% returned your PS4 to you without you calling the police had you paid the remaining balance. Sorry that it came to that but when a customer agrees to a price and is told of all aspects of what we are doing then we hold them to the same standard we are held to. From that point on that becomes your responsibility to follow through while we had done the same. Apologies for the delay in the quotes but with that severe of damage and milk it took quite the time to figure everything out. Glad you finally paid the balance and got your device, You device is now free from all milk and in working standard up to the hard drive that needs replacement. Feel free to watch some youtube videos on replacements and attempt the repair at home so you can save some of the money. I know that was a concern. Luckily that repair is a 3 out of 10 on the ifixit scale for difficulty. Hope that clears up any misinformation in your day and in the future. Have a great day Saleh!"}<//Resp>< Review>
They are lier what they say don’t do that. They told me to fix my ps4 in couple days but it took more than two weeks. Finally they unable to figure out the problem and despite that they charged me extra money for cleaning which was not necessary. I found these people corrupt and not fully expert in their field. They they did not want to release my ps4 back to me as I was not paying them for the extra charges, then I called police and with the help of police I got back my ps4 from them. So please be aware of this corrupt business.</Review>

<Text>Let me just start off by saying: This place is the best!
Brought in my phone, for a screen repair, and they fixed it right up, good as new, and super quick!
Came back in because I dropped my phone, in a puddle on a rainy day (the same phone), which cracked the screen. They took it in for a board wash and screen replacement, to remove all water from the device, but got it back sooner than expected, and it works good as new. These guys are lifesavers!! The employees are super knowledgeable and friendly. Never going to anyone else, EVER again!
This place rocks!</Text>< pictures>

I went today to that store to fix my iPhone 7 Plus, first thing they charge me $32 to do diagnose defined out what’s wrong, then they told me it need to be bored wash they charge me another $33 The total became $65 and They told me will be ready same day or next day, then I called by the end of the day they told me is better for you to buy a new phone , because you need a new motherboard or they have to delete all data and cost more than phone worth which is there’s a boss to say that after the diagnosed , And they didn’t refund me anything. This store rip me off. just be careful when you go to the store . I wish I could give them negative stars.</Review>

<Review>Quick, Easy Done.
Got my phone fixed here for a charging issue. Tried cleaning it out myself and busted my charge port. Erik took the time to check it out, and let me know I busted my charge port. Little sad that I broke it myself, so definitely my fault, but Erik explained how everything would work, how long it would take, fees associated with it, and the whole 9 yards. Never been happier with the customer service and the speedy service provided. Two thumbs up for sure!</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I have been to Love 2 fix before and they helped me out last time with my iPhone 6 battery. This time I dropped my phone in the sink so I called them to see if they could help me! They told me to power the phone off and bring it in as soon as possible so I raced over because they told me it was important to get it in as soon as possible. I got in and they told me it was $59.99 to do a board wash and diagnostic on it to see if there was any damage to my phone. After a little over an hour I get a call that they washed the phone and were checking to be sure that the phone was fine. I got a call back later that the phone was fine because I got it in so fast. If you get your phone wet DO NOT WAIT! Take it to Love 2 Fix while it isn't too late!</Review>

Fixed up a water damaged cell phone and reset the software on a tablet in a snap. Reasonably priced and friendly personnel who were very thorough.  Definitely recommended for 'anything' with a power button that needs service.</text>

<review>Poor costumer service skills among the employees. My hubs found this place when I busted my screen. Was quoted less than 100 to fix it(on the phone). But when we brought it in person it was over 100 so we left the store. Like 10 -15 mins later my hubs, got a phone call. Saying the that the one employee had misunderstood. I think that costumer shouldn't be the one to suffer because of the employee's lack of communication skills. We went back for what we were quoted which was less than $100.

Update: They weren't even able to fix my damaged phone. They gave us a full refund, which is very much appreciated! 😁</review>< Pics>

<text>Brought my iPad in because i dropped it in a puddle. Didn't know any good tech repair shops in town, so I got referred from a friend, who told me they did exceptional work. Spoke to Erik, and told me they would have to do a "boardwash" to remove all the liquid from the device to try and save it. He also gave me a rundown of what the next steps would be, and he reassured me, that my device was in good hands. Came back to pick up, and works good as new. This is by far, my favorite repair shop, and they'll fix anything with a power button.  Definitely coming back here for all my electronic repairs!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVRsOaCHdBKcuav93zRe1aGcBV-d6tKgTw5uTr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics></record>

The only instance near what your referring to would be a gentleman who parked on the curb yesterday that came in with his friend and the home button was damage when it checked in during diagnostics and they declined repair options due to cost cause it is a more intense repair then the average screen. Your name doesn’t seem to match theirs but if that’s you then we would still be willing to repair it for you but that sensor on the home buttons are a sensitive matter and are very tedious to repair. It’s not a typical parts swap. If that’s the case and your whom I think you are then swing by and I can give you a run down to clear any false expectation up. If not all good were here 7 days a week.

After a review of needing the mic and screen and earspeaker replaced you approved and then had us replace only to cancel right after and demand we refund the labor.  Unfortunately as we put over 4 hours into that device we offered to send parts pack and refund what we got back, we were more then willing to help but it seemed like your attitude turned on a dime and started to accuse us of breaking your device when you knew what you had done previously to it without disclosing said facts.

Busted my iPhone screen, and they got it done in 30 mins. Now my phone looks good as new. Could not be happier.
Came back the next day because my buddy dropped his iPhone, and low and behold, 30 mins later, it looked good as new. Buddy was happy, and I am definitely coming back for my next screen fix.

<Review>I spoke to Clayton on the phone last week to ask some questions about getting my computer fixed up because I think it had a bug in it. I did not know what information he needed off of the computer so he offered to find it for me if I brought it in for him to look at (I am technology dumb). The front desk person checked my computer in and Clayton looked at it. I had a ton of junk files and programs because of all the emails I had opened up. He was so nice and helped set up windows defender for me and gave me a checklist on what to look out for in an email to see if it was bad. Very good experience</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

{'time': 1597210483813, 'text': "Wrong, Considering myself the Owner/Operator Told you as you came in i had to step out. I was stuck in a Mandatory Zoom meeting for 2 hours so apologies but that's just the facts. Erik my manager tried to help you with information about the store policy and policy your husband agreed to when purchasing the Used laptop instead of fixing his previous one he broke in a oddly similar way in the end of June. You were very rude threatening and near belligerent to him for no reason. I Told him just to stop service and refuse any further work on the device after your scene.\n\nThe facts are he was told there was a 30 day Support and Return policy on This laptop as a courtesy. He was made aware at the time of purchase about extending that coverage against breakage and software related damage through squaretrade. He declined the offer. He was in a hurry to get a working unit quickly so i can understand the haste he was in. Still he could have changed his mind within the typical 7 day Used item warranty as spoken about and let us know. Today he brings in the laptop near 40 days after the purchase to let us know the system has crashed. Upon first inspection we find the units operating system will not load. Indicative of a software problem either with windows updates or something that may have been downloaded incorrectly but still not a hardware failure from first glance, we notify him he is not under warranty due to date and type of failure and would have to pay for a diagnostic and we will get to it by tomorrow. Before the end of the day you come in and created the lovely atmosphere we then had making threats and screaming with other customers in the lobby.\nSo we have decided to refuse service and immediately processed your refund for the diagnostic.\n\nThis is not how i like to do business but with your actions today of which i am shocked. Even after Erik at your request gave you the breakdown of all items you've had serviced with us in the past and all individual charges made by yourself and your husband not including the laptop just so you could demand a refund for all monies spent with us . Sadly that is not an option. Especially since the laptop was a purchase explicitly sold as is and in working condition at the date of sale. Not to mention all consignment items are typically 7 day warranties but i extended his due to his need of a data recovery on the old laptop and transfer to this one in his haste. I made sure all his information was on the laptop and even reloaded it due to a mistake on my techs part of only loading 98% of the recoverable data. So i had them restart the 20 Hour process free of charge. Ask your husband im sure he remembers having to come back to retrieve the laptop due to that error. Apologies.\n\nAt this time I regret to inform you we will not offer any service for your devices in the future I would kindly ask you seek help from a different small business.\n\nI truly hope you get whatever current or future issues you need fixed resolved but as it stands we will no longer be able to help you.\n\nHave a great day"}<//Response>

My computer was running very slowly and I was getting tons of really weird popups on my desktop. I took it in to Love 2 Fix and Jason checked it in. He told me that it would take a few hours, but that I would hear about an update by end of day. I called the next morning after they opened to get an update because I thought they forgot about me, but my voicemail box was full so they could not leave a message. Oops! I had some viruses and a "Ransomware" that was trying to access and lockout my computer! They ran a tuneup and virus removal and the computer seems the be doing better now.<//Text>

Amazing service, great products! They were able to get my water logged phone back to life! I was so glad to be down the road from them.

Love 2 Fix has low prices for awesome service. I would recommend these guys to anyone who has any technology issues.

They're fast and friendly. Come give them a see for yourself!<//Review>

I messaged a couple people on facebook and the fastest person to get back to me was Jack and that he worked at this shop in Carmichael. He told me to bring the phone in and that they could take a quick look at it. When I got in they messed around with my phone and pointed out that the phone still vibrated and buzzed when you pushed the buttons and that was a good sign. They had me check in my phone because they were busy (it was a friday night) and that they would call me by end of business with an update. I got a call about an hour later that they tested the phone with a new screen and everything was fine!!! They said that my diagnostic fee of 29.99 could go towards the cost of the screen which was 79.99 for the iPhone 8. I am so happy with how quickly they fix my phone. I was afraid that they would need it for a few days, but I got it in the evening of the same day.</review>< Pics>

I brought in my phone because the screen was lifting up. They charged me 30 and ran a diagnostic. They called me as I was driving home from work and said the battery was bulging and it was pressing on the screen. I was lucky I had an older android because it just pushed up the lcd and didn't break it. They said they had to order the part in and needed a deposit so I told them I would swing by the next day to take care of that. Two days later they called me and said my phone was ready for pickup. I felt like i was going to die without my phone for a few days, but it feels so good to have it back.</review>

Came to buy a laptop cause mine broke and they said it was new as in i would get a charger with it but they didn't have the original one and they had to rest the computer had to leave came back and now said it's extra for the charger because it didn't come with one so much for a " brand new one"</Text>

Came to these guys because my home button stopped working on my iPhone 7+, I thought it was for sure done for. These guys reassured me that they could get it back up to working order. They were able to ship it out and get it all back in working order. They kept me advised every step of the way, even tolerated me calling daily. I am so grateful for these guys and their awesome service.< /text>

My external hard drive was working and the next minute it wasn't. All of my pictures are on it as I use it as a backup of my phone and computer.
I went to Ubreak Ifix and they just referred me to xxxx, which wanted to charge me $700 to $3000 to diagnose and recover the data from the drive.
I then called Love 2 Fix and brought the device in for Chris to examine. Within 10 minutes he diagnosed that the drive was ok and he could fix it.  As I was filling out the paperwork, everything on my device appreared on his monitor.
I am so thankful for Chris and his employees at Love 2 Fix! All of my pictures since 2015 was on this drive including my daughter's wedding.
I HIGHLY recommend tgis to anyone with a computer, phone, or any device problem.

Thank you Chris!</Review>

I brought my laptop into these guys,  it was having connection issues.  They had no issues telling me what was, how to fix it,  and how long it would take.  These guys were professional but at the same time you could see they like their work.

Now my computer runs better than ever and it didn't break the bank! Thanks for saving this college kid!< /Review>

I messaged love 2 fix at 2am with a question about my iPod classic not synching anymore  not expecting a reply and went to bed. When I work up the next day they responded to my question overnight telling me to bring it in for a diagnostic because there could be a few problems that cause that issues. $29.99 later and they told me that the hard drive was broken and they could upgrade me to a flash card so that it ran faster and held more storage. They took the cost of the diagnostic off the repairs and the iPod runs better than ever!< /review>

I do not recommend this place at all!!
They took my iphone 6S it apparently had water damage. I paid them 170$ I came to pick up my phone 1st time..it wasn't turning on still ... they told me to come back..I came back the 2nd time.. i was in a rush to get my kids from school so I didn't even test the phone.. I trusted them because I've been here before many times .. I take my phone .. I get in my car..down the road I decide to turn it on and it still doesn't turn on.. I called them and they told me to bring it back.. which I did few days later ..
Anyways they call me and tell me.
Oh well it's not the boardwash .. its something else..
It will be more money..
Like hello..I paid 30 diagnostic fee.  .. they told me its the boardwash.   Itll fix the problem... that's why they told me to pick up the phone .. and i did..so obviously you guys dont know what you're doing!!!
I told them I already spent 170$ on this phone.  It's not worth it . I wont pay more to fix it. I told them to give me my phone back.. they agreed but TO KEEP MY MONEY TOO!!!! they only refunded me 70$!!!
They CHARGED ME FOR THEIR " Labor " like excuse me ???? I picked up my phone in the same condition as I left it ..NOT WORKING !! I DONT CARE if you worked on it...YOU STILL DIDNT FIX THE  PROBLEM !!!! AND GAVE ME MY BROKEN PHONE BACK... just becaus and couldnt fix it.
They didnt charge a diagnostic fee nor any other fee!!!!

Because they couldnt get the job done
That's what this owner should have done

I wish I drove the extra mile and didnt try to save on gas !! These guys suck !!
Took my phone and gave me back a broken phone and the owner Chris. ..you lack customer service
And you're a very mean person. .< /Text>

{'time': 1554763570044, 'text': 'My apologies i almost didnt recognize you with the fake name. You came in for a damaged hdmi port which was fixed. Once fixed we tested and booted your device infront of you. Your system stated you needed to reinstall the firmware. We charged you 29.99 for the firmware install to the hard drive yes. You came back a few days later with the device claiming it would not turn on. We powered it up and left it playing for 5 hours. We informed you of this and when you returned for the device we had rebooted it over 15 times. Consequently the issue you have lays dormant. The apu on your device is failing but not dead. It is working and was so when you left. I personally briefed you on total cost to repair and how that would work with your current repair. Unfortunetly with the physical damage to the port and the fact that they are 2 seperated issues we would not be able to refund for the hdmi port which is working and fixed. Should you choose to fix the apu issue then we would be more then happy to bundle the 2 together but it would not be a same day service to get done. I know you were in a bit of a rush to complete it. Feel free to give us a call if you wish to complete it. Have a great day'}<//resp>

<review>Saw a sign while driving by and figured it would be worth a stop. My iphone touch has been weird and laggy so I checked it in for a diagnostic with the technician and he said I would get a call by the end of the day. I got a call about 40 minutes later and they said that they could fix the problem by swapping my screen because the digitizer was cracked from when I dropped it. I paid 29.99 for them to look at my phone and they took that cost out of the repair so I only paid the difference to get it fixed. I only paid about 75 total to get my screen fixed and I have not had a problem since!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

We walked your daughter through the entire repair costs for a new hard drive along with data swap and logic board work since she was the customer on record who brought the laptop in. It's very hard to understand what was needed since this was our first interaction on this device but with devices that have been worked on this heavily in the past we wanted to make sure everything was clear. We made sure at each junction to call and inform you daughter of the process and what we had found. We did not upsell you or your daughter on anything. Only recommended a new hard drive since we confirmed hers was dead which is common with the sounds you were hearing. We recovered her data and installed it to the new SSD she chose from our options. We gave her the prices and differences on the entirety of the repair. I understand you may not have been given the entire picture since we were dealing with your daughter but I highly recomend talking to her since she was made aware of all costs and balances and work that was needed to be performed . Before doing so as policy.

they had fixed in my phone for me before as well as a laptop and I was really pleased. I brought in my daughter's MacBook that had an intermittent shutdown issue as well as a rattle in the hard drive and we replace the hard drive and they up sold me on installing something else that I really don't understand what the hell it was gave me the impression that the laptopwas worth more than what it was so I okayed the repair and then they came back and told me that the intermittent shut down if she wasn't resolved and that I needed to replace the screen and I was going to be another three hundred bucks which would be worth more than the damn computer was so all-in-all I'm not really pleased at all< /review>

They promised to fix my mobile for $75 however, they didn’t mention about any inspection fee of ($29) in the beginning. When I checked back to have my mobile, they said that they were unable to fix my mobile and instead they asked for an extra money ($29) for its inspection.

Diagnose cost for a thermal printer was $33.  If they could fix it, will allow you to apply that $33 toward total repair cost.  Price is somewhat steep for their labor.   My repair cost $80 and for me to buy a new one is around $400.  Not significant saving since you don't know how long before it craps out again.  The only reason I went ahead with this repair is because it takes few weeks for my new printer to arrive.<//review>

{'time': 1541313080665, 'text': 'Hello Basil, sorry you feel that way about the labor costs. Your thermal printer was an interesting case in which not many have the knowledge to work on in our industry. Your total cost was 79.99 which in turn is about 3 hours of labor. If you break that down then the total cost is less then 27 dollars an hour. I can assure you this is pretty reasonable for specialty electronics. Also that does come with a 90 day warranty on our labor. So if something happens or goes out again feel free to bring it back in anytime. I hope that helps and feel free to contact myself or any one here anytime. Have a great weekend.'}</response>

{'time': 1580313959993, 'text': "Apologies ivan but our diagnostics were made clear when you dropped the device off, you paid the 29.99 and nothing more. We then spent close to 4 hours diagnosing and attempting to fix the issue to your logic board. Based on the information you gave us we tried our original camera sets to see if you maybe bought a aftermarket then under the microscope we found tool damage to components around the camera line and after replacing the damaged components found issues to the power line of the cameras. With the way the damage was done to your logic board when you attempted to fix it yourself , simply put the cost to fix the issue would outweigh the cost of a new board. If for some reason I could have helped you understand that better then apologizes but our diagnostics are a benefit to our customers and ourselves so we can put the highest amount of time into in depth repairs like this, otherwise most shops find out it's a logic board issue and state it is unrepairable hence they put no more then 10 minutes into checking on the issue. I understand it can be frustrating when something is broken and you've tried to fix it only to find you've made the issue worse, but were only here to help.\nAlso just for the record I returned your device to you in the exact condition you brought it into me. Theres been no further damage to your board nor components to it. If you would like to come by I'll let you view it under the scope so you can get a better understanding of everything and the damage that was done.\nHave a great day."}< /resp>

They charge money for what you already know that is wrong for your electronics and damage it even worse to the point not being repairable else where or just refuse to fix it and charge more for there mistakes 30 dollar diagnostics should be free and then they up charge you put 100 and 300 to fix what they did wrong...never again will they get my money never.<//text>

I visited my friend in California and on my very last day at the state, I broke my iPhone Screen. The screen was shattered and I could not even touch it.  Chris fixed my screen and I was able to still leave same day and did not miss my flight.  Their pricing is reasonable too. Thank you! I'm more careful now, I got a Tempered glass screen protector.</text>

<Review>It's a little out of the way, but worth the effort. I'd banged up my Samsung pretty good and was referred to this shop by another one unwilling to take a chance on my phone. Sure, I could spend the $225 deductible and get a new phone from the insurance plan, but it's only 6 months old, so...

Bottom line, they were successful at saving my phone and saving me $160 over what my deductible would have cost me. VERY pleased with the pricing and same-day service.< /Review></record>

<Review>The shop is looks modern and professional and the staff is down to earth. Easy to work with and the prices are very reasonable. They don't have that price-gougey feel that the other repair places have. If you've tried to replace your broken phone screen before, you know what I'm talking about.

Just go here for your repairs. It's worth it.<//Review>< username>

My iPhone 6 had some crazy issues (ghosting, anonymously starting and closing apps, and unresponsive screen). I tried all software fixes including completely erasing and restoring it to factory specs, but that didn't fix it. The owner, Chris, took on my phone and performed a motherboard diagnosis. He discovered the touch chip and a trace was bad so he soldered in a new touch chip and replaced a few others along with a new screen and fixed the trace. Still didn't solve all the issues so he took another look and replaced the screen 2nd time and also added thermal paste to the cpu to help cooling. These guys did a huge amount of diagnosis and many hours of labor and parts to help fix my broken phone. But, ultimately, it looks like I'd need a new cpu or motherboard and it's not worth fixing since I can just get a new or newer phone for the price. Sometimes that's just how it works. Chris gave me store credit because he felt bad that he couldn't completely fix the phone. Any future phone issues, I will go to these guys again! Thank you for all the work you did!<//Text>

Awful in at least two ways:
1) They can't seem to actually repair my cell, and I suspect  they fixed  everytime I went this place phone have different problem.

2) Really bad about communicating when your stuff is ready. You can't expect them to call or email when it's done; you have to drive every few days. Actually bad communicators in general -- they seem to really want you to go away. After all repair and time loss I purchased another new phone do not waste your time and money visiting this place.<//Review>

<resp>{'time': 1569972906447, 'text': 'Moreed, Having purchased a Stolen iPhone can be a difficult situation and im sorry that happened to you, truly.\n\nFirst we didn\'t charge you for "nothing". we shared part of the charge discussed when you dropped off the Iphone X that turned out to be stolen, and in lost icloud mode. $199 if successful.\n\nUnfortunately the device was reported stolen and in turn they charged us for the attempt. We in turn shared some of that cost with you as discussed previous to the repair.\n\nWhen you dropped off the X the Unlock technician personally spoke with you about trying to remove the icloud and what the 3rd party would charge for that service and what we would mark up the service in turn.\n\nAlso we only charged you the cost of a shop diagnostic which is $29 compared to the $47 the 3rd party charged us. During your drop off the technician spoke to you about these costs and the likely-hood of the imei exchange working without having access to the information to check. He also notified you of the time frame 3/5 business days at most and how the service worked.\n\nI have reviewed this conversation per our indoor cameras since you were so intent that not any cost was described to you so i wanted to get to the bottom of that ASAP. I have myself heard the technician in fact did describe the cost that would be associated if the device was in the Stolen/Lost mode.\n\nIts understandable to be frustrated Since your at a loss by purchasing such a device in the first place but i am unsure why this is aimed at us. We are here to help and did everything in our power to do so. In the future should you need anything we are always here to help . Thank you for sharing your thoughts\n\nFeel free to contact me anytime'}< /resp>< pictures>

Must say a Super Service, I can rely on someone for repairs anytime. Got my iPhone done. Faster than conventional service centers with timely communication. Most definitely highly recommended.<//text>

Horrible Service! My brother's phone screen began to peel off after these people "fixed it" within 2 weeks. The cost was approx. $150 for the screen and the labor approx. $130. The screen then detached from the phone and it was broken again. The TECH apparently applied SUPER GLUE to hold the screen in place, however, it was not strong enough to hold.

The TECH then said our 30 day warranty does not cover " IF THE PHONE FALLS" and therefore a new screen is needed (another $150). I was so upset with this and I told him how I felt he did a POOR job with the repair. HOW IS A SCREEN GOING TO COME OFF SO FAST WITH THE PHONE NOT FALLING?

DONT COME HERE, SUCH POOR QUALITY!!< /Text>

Great service & customer service. My son's gaming computer stopped working. It is an expensive purchase several years ago, out of warranty & to ship to vendor on the east coast would be little over $150 (that's what it cost me for warranty repair). I have used Love 2 Fix to salvage my sister coffee drowned Mac Box Air and a screen replacement of Fit Bit Blaze (because Fit Bit isn't set up to repair their own devices). Both time were stellar service. However this time, they went over the top. We dropped off the computer around 10:30. They would diagnose and call me with what they found - probably in the afternoon. Less than an hour they had been able to determine it was a failed power supply - they would get one locally and the computer would probably be ready sometime tomorrow. So imagine my surprise when John called me before 4 pm - the computer was fixed and ready for pick up. That is like a 5 hour turn around! I tell my family and friends that Love 2 Fix is the best store to get your electronics fixed. Prices are very reasonable, service is awesome, customer service is the best. 3 times customer - will be 4th time - as I am dropping off my IPAD tomorrow to fix a disabled issue compounded by Find My IPAD problem that I can not get past.< /text>

<GmapID>0x809adc209b732dbd:0x544827a4975d768a</GmapID><text>I wish they had an option for 0 Stars. Went in to get my screen replaced for an iPhone 6 Plus. Was happy to hear that there was a 15% off because they over stocked on screen replacements for that phone. When I came back to get my phone they said they had to replace the battery because it exploded while they were working on my phone. They charged me $30 more bucks. I let it slide only because they gave me a deal on the screen replacement. Then when we were checking out he sold me on screen protector which was the smart idea but seemed like he was just selling me. I ended up spending big $160 when it initially should of been $120. Two weeks go by and a spot of orange popped up on my screen. Took it in and he said it was the frame of my phone that was damaging the screen. (I never seen this before). He said he fixed it but it came back within 1 day. 2 more weeks go by and the screen replacement starts coming off. So I took it in and told him about it and he said it was my frame. And then he took the screen replacement off and THEN said it was the battery was pushing the screen up and that's the problem. Seems like too many excuses. I told him he charged me for a battery replacement. So we looked up my name for the recent charges and there was 2 transactions one for $119.00(screen replacement) and another for $36.00(battery & screen protector). And he told me that he didn't replace the battery that it's the original. So he tried to sale me on another battery! I asked him if a screen protector costs $36.00 and he said yes. I googled screen protector and they're $5-10. I got ripped off. I'm buying a new phone. This was my first and last experience going to a 3rd party phone repair shop. Thanks! If anyone wants to get ripped off come to this place right here!</text>< rate>

<review>I found this shop online and took my laptop to them i have a problem with my laptop and they charge me 69.99$ for the diagnostic and i told them before that I don’t have the charger for my laptop they said it’s fine we Figure it out and I left. After 4 days i call them and check my laptop status they said we don’t have charger we’re waiting for you for bring charger I said why you guys didn’t tell me that day 1. So I could have arrange the charger. anyway i order new charger and give it to them and after 2 days they told me hard drive is bad and need to be replaced and new Operating system need to be installed. so they told me over the phone that hard drive Installation 99.99$ and  operating system cost 129.99 so total cost me 230 plus tax but your diagnostic fee will cover 70 dollors of the total cost. 230 - 70.  I said ok please fix my laptop after 2 days they fix my laptop i go there for pick up my laptop they said total is 280 somthing. They said that diagnostic fee will not cover The total cost. And that it is already removed from the prices listed above. No one told me that before. Long story short. I will never go to those people again. It’s really stupid for them to tell someone one thing and at the end say something else. I paid so much extra for no reason. Then they started saying oh we gave you discount 129.99 on install the windows. Over regular price is 199. Who charge 200 to install windows?. Totally trying to change the topic and having me pay more then what they said at the beginning. Worst experience ever idk how they have 4.1 stars. Probably fake reviews...< /review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1545082993411, 'text': "Hey Shah, sorry to hear your unhappy. Here's the same response I provided to you on yelp. We spoke the night you dropped the device off and I spoke about the que and how long it would take to get a call with current work going on in the que. My apologies if we didnt get that done sooner then qouted but on time. Our universal was not charging your device after the diagnostic was completed and I apologize but it would have taken longer to replace the tips then you to bring in yours, we only needed it to test a new hdd in your system after we determined the issues with your hard drive at that point. You did not tell us about ordering one as you stated you would simply bring it by that day. I see your frustrations with that and wish I knew it was an issue. Two days later our new charger tips arrived and you dropped your old charger off the same day a hour apart,  Also I went over the recording to confirm due to our conversation of us never giving you those prices and  we did make the qoute clear to you about you bringing your own hard drive vs us providing one and the cost of software and installation. We spoke 3 times about pricing and  the cost of everything. Phillip specifically broke it down to you the first time we qouted it by giving you the total remaining price and the end total paid price. The edit dates on your invoice as well state it was clearly updated only after the call to get your approval so I do stand behind phillip on the qoute he provided and the work he completed. We Also spoke that we could not transfer your old hacked key that was for the wrong windows. We refuse to use or endorse fraudulent windows copies so it's understandable when people do not know the cost of new copies from Microsoft.  We apologize if this confuses you in any way. We made sure to be specific each time speaking to you on overall cost and remaining amounts due. Should you care to listen to the qoutes feel free to swing in anytime. Sorry we wouldnt remove our labor out as you insisted but we stuck to our qoute from start to finish. Hopefully that helps and should you need anything feel free to contact me directly anytime.\n\nHappy holiday's."}<//response>

Long story and long history. We were dealing with things that separate the honorable men from the frauds and Chris is an honorable man. Not much could have gone worse from a hardware view, but from a customer service view nothing could have gone better.
Chris and his crew not only have a customer for life but a friend as well.

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Anything and everything I’ve ever had fixed here beyond having a phone screen replaced lasts less than 60 days. Here’s a few examples.

PS3- “can’t be fixed.” My BF and roomate went online and you tubed it and now it works great. This is after them charging me for a diagnostic I told them I’d already done at home.
LABTOP BATTERY- any and every time the replaces a component it never lasted long. Heads up. They get their replacement parts from eBay. Which means 2 things. They can’t guarantee quality (this comes up again in the next example) and if for some reason you go outside of the warranty they have with this supplier you don’t know and can’t independently validate, then you’re looking at paying for parts twice.
iPhone - Screen replacement turned into it needing a mother board replaced. Not their fault. Through a series of eBay shenanigans they had my phone for 3 weeks (remember when I said that their suppliers were suspect?) and I had to contact them periodically for updates. So fine, they fix it. Finally. It lasted 2 months. A month of which I was on vacation in a remote part of Montana with cell service. Was barely on my phone so I didn’t notice that they hadn’t fixed anything. I come back after it started getting glitchy again. Same problems as it had before and after dropping 400 some odd dollars on parts and labor. “Well it’s past the warranty with the supplier” they said. We can try and dispute it. Never heard back. I had to call them after a few weeks for an update. To find out their was “nothing they could do.”
Over the years I’ve probably spent 1000 dollars here and have nothing to show for it. They won’t get my business again. I highly suggest you look elsewhere. A place that that uses “super glue because I couldn’t find the screw” isn’t worth the money. That said, they’re super friendly.

I completely understand your upset that we cannot get your device information off the Bent iPhone 8 Plus, We recommend sending it out because the board is physically bent so the connection internal to the board is damaged.  Im unsure what size vehicle ran this over but the damage is severe enough the entire housing fell to pieces in starting the diagnostic. Clumps of components on the board smashed to pieces. We've restored all physical hardware to the logic board but the device still will not take power. The next step would be to remove your memory in attempt to restore function but that's not what you want so we now will refer to a more invasive technique for your data recovery. If you wanted just the phone back up and running then no problem i can fix that for you but the cost would outweigh the replacement cost and hence it would not be efficient for your needs nor your pocket book. The company we are recommending will take the components off your board that hold the memory and retrieve it in that way. That's our recommendation and you can send it in or not the choice is completely up to you.\n\nHopefully you have a better day. Were always here if you need us."}<//Resp>

< Review>
I was in California for a brief family reunion and my niece fell on top of my macbook and broke the screen. I was working on a school assignment and the deadline was at 10 pm. I was lucky to find this place, I did not believe when the told me it would not take long to fix it. My macbook was ready in no time and it was as if nothing ever happened to it. The price too was unbeatable.Nice job guys, u sure know what you're doing.</Review>

I can’t explain how happy I am with their service and the fact that they saved me $600. This is the 2nd time I have had something fixed here and I will be a customer for life! Wouldn’t even think about going somewhere else!

I spilled water on my 2017 MacBook Air. Apple told me $750 just to fix it, not replace it. FYI Applecare is a rip-off, it covers barely anything and no physical damage. Love2fix charged me $129 and my laptop is working like nothing happened! I’m so grateful for this place. Definitely go with them for anything you need fixed. Places like this are why small businesses should be supported.< /review>< Name>

But this repair shop is a Highway  robbery
Someone referred  my cousin to this place
Hi phone had a charging problem after inspection they told him it’s going to cost you $75 dollar they are both agree to fix it then the tech said come tomorrow and get your phone it will be fix
Next day they called and said we are not able to fix it  my cousin said ok I gonna come and get my phone after he was asking to give the phone the manager was asking for $29.99 for no reason after
I know some places that fix his phone for $30 but the problem is they hold his phone and not give it to him back now my cousin is don’t know what to do
I strongly suggest you guys don’t waste your money and your time
There all places doing better job for less price

Haven't had any problems and been here with phones and other electronics for them to fix.   Much cheaper to get a phone fixed than buy a new one.  My phone issues we're connectors that had gone bad.  Was repaired within 1 day and the repairs have held up.< /text>

i have not seen anyone repair phones this fast. these guys are so trained and equipped with every tool possible to give your iphone or samsung screen a brand new look. while visiting my brother in california yesterday,  my toddler damaged my iphone screen while watching mickey mouse. luckily for me, i found these guys on the web and fixed it in a jiffy! i was super relieved because at some point, i thought i might have to start saving for a new phone. thanks a lot guys, i appreciate your help a lot!< /review>

I took my phone for a diagnostic after i sold it on ebay and the buyer returned it saying it was broken. These guys found that the buyer had switched parts out and returned it. They then wrote a report with great details and pictures to go with it that helped me win my case with ebay and paypal and got me the money back. They were all nice and made it an easy experience. Will go back to them for any repairs on electronics. Thanks for the help guys< /text>

Sold them a phone on Ebay. they asked for a return. I refunded the money and now they don't want to return the phone or answer my messages. I even talked to him on the phone and he is using ebay policy to rip me off and not return my item.

Go tell whomever you want. You are a thief who took my item got his money back and the shipping money.

Ebay specifically instructed me to contact you regarding the return.<//review>

It means they kept it for sometime to show that they worked on it.<//Text>

<Review>I've been taking my phones and laptops to Chris for 4+ years.  These people love their jobs and it shows. They offer fair pricing, are honest, hardworking and trustworthy. I purchased a refurbished Lenovo ThinkPad at a great price and it works like brand new. Thanks Chris and guys!<//Review>< user_name>

<text>As part Iranian, I approve of this delicious Iranian ice cream. I've been meaning to try this place for years, and I'm a los Angeles native, so shame on me. All the flavors are tasty. Located in a random shopping center so kinda hard to find if you aren't familiar with the area.< /text><Time>1608400795706< /Time><Rate>4</Rate>< Name>

What an amazing little ice cream parlor! I was shocked by how good the ice cream was here. I've practically grew up in SF practically all my life but I never bothered to come try this place out. If it weren't for my friend, I would of never known about this place honestly.<//review>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>I always get a classic green milk tea with boba and it tastes so good every time. The perfect amount of sweetness and lightness on the tea, and the boba is always perfectly chewy and sweet. They do the boba well--some places the tea is good but the boba is bland--so the drinks are well balanced. I've had the oolong which is good too just not a personal preference< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bcbb695412cf:0x5b610bc0e2246465< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I came here awhile ago with my boyfriend. The food is amazing! They make some really tasty sandwiches and delectable sweets. The store even has a cute whimsical look to it. The only downfall is that parking can be hard to find and it can get pricey.</text>

<Review>I've been here before but didn't review it. I was with friends post CA Symphony Soundbox Saturday and we wanted ice cream at 11:45 pm Saturday night. The yogurt shoppe was OPEN. We happily enjoyed scoops of the deliciously rich peanut butter chocolate and the chocolate cassis...along with at least a dozen others who were happy to find them open at that hour!< /Review></record></dataset><record>
<gmapID>0x80c2bcbb695412cf:0x5b610bc0e2246465</gmapID><text>This place is just OK.

The decorum is cool, but its hard to find a place to sit that isn't too loud or too bright.  They have a great selection of gelato flavors, but their gelato isn't really worth the drive.  They do have excellent floats though.

I don't go to eat here as the food is just ok, but will gladly for dessert after a meal.  Order the brownie sundae, it's the best thing they've got.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>113570475490286183950</UserId.><resp>None<//resp><rating>4< /rating>< name>

Hands down my favorite scoop shop of all time! Their flavors of the month have me coming back every month for 3 years now and I'm obsessed with this place! I don't have much to say about it honestly because it's that good. Overall very awesome unique flavors. Flavors of the month are better than the OG flavors in my opinion.<//text>

I ordered an ice cream sandwich and a blue velvet cake, while the the latter was above average and former was just okay. This place is overrated. By the way, I went in the morning and the place was not even that busy.< /Text><time>1590982203000</time></record></dataset><record>

Today a friend and I shared the prosciutto sandwich and the roasted chicken salad... Pretty pricey but it was worth it. .. portion size decent. .. We both were full and we didn't even finish the sides. .. And of course we had to get the Thai tea ice cream sandwich which we also shared but wish we didn't because it was soo good. .. If you love thai tea that is a must. .. Thank you milk see you in April<//text>

On the way home from a great dinner out, they suggested stopping at the "best yogurt place ever". It sounded like a good idea, but what I wasn't expecting was to be blown away by this  great yogurt. By far the best I have ever had. The peanut butter is to die for. I am just sorry we live so far away, but I know where we will go every time we make a trek to LA!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>Nice little place to come get some dessert. They offer a whole variety of different kinds to things for you to choose from. Sandwiches, cakes, shakes, etc. I'm sure whatever you're craving at the time, they'll have something just for you.

The only thing that sucks is the parking situation. You've got to get real lucky.

There are a lot of Hasidic Jews in this area and my friend was like "I've never seen so many Amish people before." Hahaha. Too cute.< /Text>< Time>

Customer service is terrible! One of the workers went up to me and yelled at me for getting too big of a sample. He should not treat his customers like that. I was going to buy some frozen yogurt but after that, no way. I also asked what was in one of their toppings and they have no idea. I’m probably never going to go back, because I do not want to get yelled at and mistreated again for no reason. The worker could of at least kindly confronted me.</text>

I virtually NEVER sit down and just relax- but this place makes me never want to leave. It's the cookies and milk world for grown-ups (bc TRUST- children cannot afford these prices). The style is like a pinterest page come to life- just lean into it and enjoy the frills. A great little refuge for girlfriends to catch up or get a quiet moment to yourself. It's a little DIY with an adorable couple, so if you're into supporting local businesses, this is a great way to support!</Review>

Honestly kinda a weird place, they have a lot of random desserts and also actual lunch/dinner food. I've only had desserts and they're pretty average at an average price, except their shaved ice is fairly cheap. Might come again.<//Text>

Always a great place for some frozen yogurt. If you’re a huge fan of it I suggest purchasing one of the tubs in the fridge near the back. $7.00 and it will last you a few days!</text>

No! This store is far below my personal standards for cleanliness. Unprofessional staff that is not properly trained in food safety management.
General manager Sara spends her evenings swooning over a male employee. Making people in stores uncomfortable. Maybe she should be more concerned with offering quality product and service then stating google eyed at an employee desperately hoping he'll smile at her. 👎🏼<//Text>

Mind you I NEVER write reviews, I honestly just don’t take the time ... but because of this place I have! This is my FIRST review.

I walked in as a Grubhub delivery person. I was greeted with the most warm smile and and best help in getting my frozen yougurt order. That was amazing! But on top of that I saw another employee outside of the restaurant that was walking back in. He saw I had an order from them. He went OUT OF HIS WAY just to say “Hey, thank you so much for coming to the yogurt shoppe!”. The HUGGEST smile and he barely looked 17. Wow, great work ethic, great yogurt shoppe. I will be going back as a customer, not just as a part-time grubhub driver! :)< /text>

< review>
Waited over an hour took 3 cars before us even though they arrived after us. Took over 45 mins to test a car it would not pass a cap test and he kept resetting his machine at least 10 times. I finally mentioned that maybe they need a new gas cap. Either he wanted this person to pass no matter what it took. Or his machine was not working anyway we waited over an hour and left without getting tested.</review>

Wills, I used to come to you for smog checks for years. You were very nice, courteous and attentive. Last summer I went to you to find out about the check engine light that went on in my car and you stated it was the o2 sensors. You informed me to change them and it would take care of the problem. I asked you if you thought it could be the cat and said no. You said change the sensors, disconnect the battery to reset the codes and drive it about 100 miles and bring it back in, which I did. You informed me it hadn't cycled yet and was incomplete, so you told me to drive it over the weekend and bring it back on Monday. I offered to pay something, but you said I didn't need to. I returned on Monday and you said it is still incomplete and to drive it a few more days and come back in. A couple of days later the check engine light came back on, so I went back to you. You seemed a little upset to see me again, but I told you the light came back on. I said you told me to come back in those times and I offered to pay a couple of times, but you said no need. You checked it and said I needed to replace the cat. After having the cat replaced, the car was fine. I still went back to you even though you seemed a little abrupt the last time. I went to your place a month later to find out if you were a Star only station to have my other car done. I spoke with your employee in the office who stated you are a Star station. As I was leaving, You called to your employee to come to you in the bay where you had talked to him and you guys started laughing in my direction. I had never felt that uncomfortable or unwelcomed in my life. I had taken you baked goods in the past because you weren't just the smog guy, but also was like a friend. If the problem was with me returning that many times, you should have told me to drive the car a couple of weeks and then return. I was out the money for the o2 sensors and had to find a new smog place after all these years. I will not patronize your business in the future and have found many places that charge less than the $50+ for smog and cert that you charge.
Regretfully, JM< /text>

If you need a Smog Check, highly recommend this place.  Honest and reasonable pricing.  Been coming to Wills Automotive for over a decade.</Text>

<Review>This is a good restaurant overall, but the food we ordered failed to meet the expectations we generally have from Little Italy restaurants. We orderes 2 pastas and in both of them we could barely taste the flavor of the ingredients. Standard is usually quite high in this area, so they really need to up their game.

Service was very good, and the decor is nice as well. It's a pleasant place to spend your evening, if the food was better.</Review>< pictures>

I come here frequent and  recommend it to anyone who comes into the city.  My favorite is the appetizers and the long list of selections for food. I will be back and so should you.< /Review><gmapID>0x808580f15d0273e5:0x9d183a779d0aefcd< /gmapID><Name>David Lowe</Name><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

The ambiance can be considered cozy and romantic, my only complaint is that it can be a little brighter because the lighting is dim. Also, the service there was great, the food came out faster than I thought it would and our server was very friendly. I had the Black Squid Ink Spaghetti with Seafood and it was delicious, I also had a little bit of Tiramisu to crave my sugar cravings and that was out of this world. I would also highly recommend to make a reservation because it was a bit packed.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Nice and quiet local restaurant with authentic Italian recipes and taste. What  I have missed from  growing up in Brooklynn
Gnocchi was flavorful but so gentle they practically melt in your mouth. So full  of flavor with the perfect texture..  I started with the beet salad that hosted  a hint of lime, goat cheese and walnuts just the right size before a  great meal. The winner; the lobster ravioli with chunks of lobster and delicious perfectly cooked prawn. The sauce was light but flavorful so it do not take away from the lobster flavor. Nice wine list, great service and the quiet ambience I crave to enjoy a great meal.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian places in the area. Fabulous!</Review>

Good Italian. Not GREAT Italian. Servers should learn menu a bit. Finally, if kitchen I closing give us a last call warning. No authentic Italian restaurant would leave customers without an espresso after lunch.</text>

Very underwhelming dinner experience last night. Restaurant empty except for one table. Out of draft beer (lager). Burrata starter bland and not the creaminess I would expect. Rack of lamb as main course completely over cooked. Pasta with sweet fennel sausage with small meat crumbs in watery sauce. We at 1/3 of it and waitress didn't even bother to ask. Chose the restaurant based on good reviews on Yelp and google, so maybe just an outlier on a Monday night but definitely not planning to return.<//Text>

Had the tagliatella which was made with pork rather than the traditional veal. Never the less, it was easily one of the best meals I have ever had. Also it was served with warm bread which was amazing. Great place! We had a very friendly waiter who gave us some advice about getting around the city. He was also very patient with a member of our party with special needs. If you're in the area, it is definetely worth the stop.< /review>

<review>I recently ate here with a group of friends from work and the majority of us ordered off the Dine About Town menu. For $37.00 we each received a starter, main-course, and a desert. I ordered scallops wrapped in bacon, pasta with veal, and had tiramisu to finish. All in all I was really impressed with the quality of the food. The portions were appropriately sized, the prices weren't too outrageous, and the courses were served pretty quickly despite the restaurant being crowded. They also had a pretty nice wine list we were able to choose from. I'm not sure that I'd go back here right away, but its certainly an above-average Italian restaurant in the already spectacular North Beach area of San Francisco.</review>< Response>

Really small Italian place with great food and a friendly staff. I'm not the biggest fan of Italian food, but walking through North Beach at dusk to enjoy this place, the wine, and the food is undoubtedly worth it. Tip: perfect date spot (although I think walking to get there is also part of the experience).</Review>

I won't spoil this with an endless list of all the treats we consume while visiting.  It's simple enough to say I was a Peninsula, Inner sunset, Marin person always as far away from North Beach as the next New Yorker, and this is actually a Italian joint in NB that isn't some silly trick.  Unbelievable food, modern, comfortable atmosphere, intimate without being crowded, clean lines and clean in general.... it's not a place to miss.  If I could stand outside of the other italian spots around that part of town and send them to Vicoletto, I would.  Great job on reinventing service and italian cuisine in north beach, with a traditional and reliable slant.  Can't wait to come back.</Text>

Lamb was delicious and the burrata opulent,  they'd get 5 stars if they had a decent Aussie Shiraz to go with the Kiwi lamb. The Nebbiolo & Barolo  were both better than the Syrah.</review>

<text>Another Italian place that's delish IF you're patient enough. Each time we've come to Vicoletto's, the service is spectacular, attentive and warm with their decor and ambiance very nice. The service in food is just killer though. And what I mean by that is that don't be surprise if it takes up to an hour for your order to arrive at your table. Why is that? Because they make everything fresh and "made to order"!! What we've learned over time is to RSVP for the first dinner shift (5pm-6pm). Food seems to arrive quicker before the dinner rush. I don't advise RSVPing for the later shift as they run out of alot of the great favorites (i.e. lobster ravioli).

And if you have a huge group (5+), it will certainly test everyone's patience as it just seems ridiculously slow and inefficient. Regardless, Vicoletto is still a great place to come enjoy some home made pasta, gnocchi and ravioli and the cozyness in the place is an added bonus...<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Sago Boba is located in a plaza along Topangga Blvd. A small shop that offers a variety of boba drink mixes and highlights an international drinks menu like the Ice Scramble, Milo drink, Buko Pandan, and more. Those are definitely worth a try! To my Filipino friends, this might be the only place to find that Philippines' Ice scramble in the Los Angeles Valley.

Parking can be challenging. Wait time can be long because only one person works there most of the time. Your experience might vary.<//Text>< username>

This place is disappointing. I don't know how it got such good reviews. The drinks were not impressive at all. Taro was too sweet, made with powder. Rose tea was very rosy, and this was probably the best here. Thai ice tea was again made with powder, not fresh. Milk tea was bland. Boba was fresh and decent. The server didn't want to be there, too good to be serving us drinks...</Text>

:) Cute little boba shop with lots of heart, art and books. Best of all, they have interesting boba flavors, combos and other drinks! Also, there's a fridge full of desserts of the Phillipines. Mmm... Definitely coming back here to try more things!<//text>

Love the their take on halo halo. They do a custom emoji ice cream taro to top it all off. Anne will bend over backward to customize to your taste. They carry a very wide range of flavors and types. Too many too mention.</Review>

Such a cozy little place with a huge menu of drinks.  Horchata smoothie with almond pudding & boba was delicious!  Very kid friendly with lots of children's books and games.  We hung out and played Battleship.  Can't wait to come back and try the ramen and the London Fog smoothie with boba!</review>

One of the best boba ever!! Beverages are not too sweet, not too creamy, not too watery, just perfect. Lite and slurping good. Boba/Jelly are lite and delicious. A lot of varieties to choose from. Nice location, ample parking spots, clean and cozy place. There are some board games available here.<//Text>

<response>None<//response><Review>Very cozy, drawing supplies for kids and their art all over the wall, the selection is INSANE. Smoothies, boba teas, hot teas, slushies, dozens of toppings, added flavors, a few desserts, AND a small selection of meals. They can make any of their drinks vegan, and did a taro almond milk smoothie for me (with oreo crumbles). It's bigger than it looks outside with a nicely sized eating area. It's easy to miss this gem but trust me, you don't want to.< /Review>< Pictures>

Ordered the avacado smoothie after not having one for quite a while. It was good and I generally enjoyed it! The boba was nice and the avacado tasted good.

If you like avacado smoothies I would recommend that you try it out.<//review>

I just finished ished picking up an order .. They have a specialty Sriracha Peanut Sauce that's phenomenal! Slower during the earlier hours of the business but picks up quite a bit later in the day.

The owner is super sweet, friendly & quick w/ making her orders. Don't shy away if you have children. They're books to read and a nice and cozy environment< /Review>

Amazing  and super tasty would go there again if possible that friendly an pretty  lady working the counter was informative  and fast with service had a salad  and a boba lemonade beverage yum.  also. If u want to donate  children's  books in exchange for a beverage  u can do that they also  sell lightly used children's Books super cheap.</Review>

It is unlike any other boba spot I have been to and that is because of the abundance amount of toys, children's books, candy, chips, and drawings laid out on the right side of the establishment's wall. It certainly appeals to families and the place seems nice for children. The worker was helpful and informal, she informed me of the sushi burrito and that it is a special item served only on the weekends.

Their boba was good, nothing extraordinary from what I have tasted. I give their Cookies n Cream smoothie with boba a 4/5 and their Strawberry smoothie with boba a 4/5 as well. It is a good spot nearby.<//review>< rate>

He told us that Ben Clark is first class and it was nice to stay only 1.2 miles away in our suite. He found our suite on Airbnb. Keep up the great work! We are proud to be part of a community vested in training professional law enforcement officers.<//review><username>Rachel Whetstone< /username>< Resp>

<text>Some of the background investigators have an attitude. Other BI's are fantastic. If you get one of the bad ones, go to a different agency. If you're qualified, you'll get hired by another agency since most socal agencies are hiring.<//text><date>1510511762884</date></record></dataset><record>

Best training for EMT's, I recommend Dr. Nollette. He really pushes you, making the final easy. But you have to put in the work!< /Review>

Hiked Devil's Slide to Taqhuitz (peak) Fire Lookout... Awesome trail, well maintained, populated, but not too much. The view at the lookout is spectacular! We came across a Forest Park Ranger, who was friendly and available to answer any questions or concerns. If you go, just make sure that you've got your wilderness permit on hand, because they will ask you for it.</Review>

Simply gorgeous! I aimed to be hiking at sunset and I got it.  Check the website before going as there's a park pass required for your car and a trail pass to be carried while hiking.  The first can be an annual National Park Card or one other. Definitely worth the winding road to get there. Not very busy when I arrived around 4pm.</review>

Devils Slide Trailhead is here. One of the 2 great hikes near Idyllwild. Some visitors ignore the "pass" requirement before going to trailhead in Humber Park then complains about getting car towed. (I think they should've issued tickets, not towed the cars, but...) It's National Forest Land. Stated clearly: "Adventure Pass or a National Parks Pass required; acquire before arriving at Humber Parking Lot." Hiked the trail on 3/25/2021.</Text>

Good place to get the dogs tired. My friend has 2 german shepherds and they loved horsing around in the snow. The main parking lot was closed due to ice on the road. We had to park down the street.  Usually only an issue during the winter time.  Some hiking trails require a permit.< /text>

<Text>A very busy hiking trail connecting to the PCT
There is parking and toilet facilities. It is a popular trail. The trail itself is recovering from fire damage. It's an easy drive from the village of idyllwild where there are all sorts of cafe and restaurants. The community has had some real blows to there income because of fire and road was outs so if you come try to purchase a meal or two to help out local economy.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

We did part of the Devils Slide trail. There are breathtaking views once you get high enough. Such views are comparable only to what I saw in Utah, however that is not in close proximity to Los Angeles. I recommend  taking the trail to have a fun time.</Review>

Hiked the Devil's Slide trail 10/20/20. Lots of gnats but trail is in great condition. The outhouse at the trail head has not been cleaned in a long time.and is unusable.  I have a strong stomach but the stench was too much even for me. For that reason, don't waste your money on a pass, it's not a maintained trail head.</Text>

We love hiking the Devil's Slide trail here to the saddle and beyond if time allows. This time the Pacific Crest Trail hikers were descending to Idyllwild for supplies or ascending to continue their trek. It was fun meeting them. There was some snow at the upper part of the trail.< /Review>

Nice place to stay for the day and enjoy a nice picnic and have a little hike as well. The scenery is very nice and they have a nice playground for children to enjoy themselves.< /review>

For snow visiting, get there early. Also, four wheel drive is recommended.  As you would expect, the pit toilets are smelly.  It officially requires an Adventure Pass.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>Visited in summer to hike Devil's Slide.  Somewhat confusing bureaucratic nonsense with the parking (you drive back to town get a parking permit from an agency at one location to go drive and park at another.  Should just charge you with a gate or something. Stupid.)  However the trail is great.  I only went to the junction, enough for me, so it was out and back.  I also hiked Ernie Maxwell trail from its other end to Humber and back - this is a easier - much less climbing.  Few people on trails, beautiful weather - although it can get a bit windy and cold on Devil's Slide.  Bring a light jacket and something to eat along the way.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Beautiful hiking trails, you can go for days on them. They are dog friendly as well. There is lots of shade. Bring mosquito repellent as there are many mosquitos.<//Review>

< Review>
The parks is wild with a very nice hike starting at abotu 6,000 ft for about 2,500 ft or so, but the rangers are not very nice, especially the guy with mustache. They provide zero service or protection, but enjoy their lazy life style. That guy spoiled our hike to get a piece of paper - a free permit, which nobody checked.
We recommend the park, but please stop by their ranger station to avoid those lazy guys.</Review>

It's a hiking trailhead, NOT A PARK. In winter, it's not snow plowed so you can't get in or out. Total mess. Idyllwild is a bust for a snow day. Go somewhere else.<//Review>

Humber park is the place to park when one climbs at either Tahquitz or Suicide Rock.  I rarely here of a break in but I don't keep anything of value in my car just in case.<//review>

<text>Darkhorse is usually in nice shape but today was just a bad day. Had a 9:20AM tee time at a tournament, we didn't get our riding cart until 9:25. They ran out of range balls, some tee boxes were not well maintained & greens were super slow? I enjoy the layout, I just wished for better conditions. Strange weather on top of that, forecasted for 107 degree's had thunder & rained for a few minutes.<//text><Date>1597627805851< /Date>< pics>

The course is in excellent shape. Really enjoy the challenging layout, every hole is different. They're going through an ownership change and renovations, so no Clubhouse. But that's not why I came here ... we're here to play golf! Expect to see lots of Wildlife if you come out.<//Text>

I've been playing this course for several years and played another round yesterday. This is always a challenging course but because it's in the best condition by far since I've been playing here, it's much more enjoyable when your getting your butt kicked by it.
Fairways are beautiful, greens were nice but pretty firm which made a tough course even tougher and the tee boxes are getting better.

On the negative side, pace of play could be improved, I played a mind numbing 5 1/2 hr round here last month on a weekday and yesterdays was a decent 4 1/2 hrs but it wasn't that crowded. I think some of the
problem is that's it's a hard course for one and carts are restricted quite a ways back from the greens, 100 yards on most holes, which causes a lot of extra walking sometimes to get to your ball.

I'll keep playing here because course condition is what I care most about and that's what management seems to be focused on.</review>

This may be the best golf course in central California.  It is very well kept. The course offers each golfer a degree of risk and reward which makes it a very engaging game.  I played the white tees and found it to be tough but fair.  There is an array of hazards which are avoidable if  you control your game.</Text>

Very fun and challenging course! It can be a little but muddy in the winter, but most golf courses are. It is very shady, super peaceful, and absolutely beautiful! I am blessed to have golf practice every day here!</review>

<text>Love this course. Today was horrible with it getting too packed and having 6 groups bubbled up on 2 holes. Part of it is over booking and not having a Marshall get the groups in front not knowing golf etiquette and screwing off losing balls and taking their sweet  as time looking for balls instead of dropping a ball. But all in all course is in great shape if you don't get stuck behind 2 times a year foursomes.< /text>< pics>

i've played here a handful of times and always had a good time. i played last saturday and the course is in great shape, especially the bunkers which have improved noticeably from last time.

sadly, this was a poor experience. the round took 5 hours and 20 minutes which, as golfers, you'll understand is excruciating. we had to wait on every single shot and there was no sign of a marshal or course staff to help the slow foursome in front move along.

i was also disappointed to learn that booking in person or over the phone costs over $30 more than booking online. that seems like a disproportionately heavy premium to pay.

i contacted the golf course via their website contact form on monday and did not receive the courtesy of a response.

it's hard to support a course which seems to care little for pace of play and customer service.

i can't imagine i'll play here again :(

--

in response to the reply from "the owner"

thanks for not really reading my message and for not addressing either of my main points.

other people enjoyed the course? that's great - i am happy for them. i did not.

your response is, effectively "we don't care you had a bad experience and we're not going to do anything to try to turn it around"

i am happy for you that, in these challenging times, you're able to just tell a disappointed customer to get lost and go elsewhere.

i'll do just that. in business, this is how you lose a customer forever.

best of luck to you.<//Review>

I’ve played here many times and many of the other courses in the surrounding areas and it’s definitely one of the best around. It’s great to hear the new owners have put some work into the course to where now the bunkers are playable again and the course I’m sure is looking amazing as ever. Can’t wait to experience the course again and see the improvements<//Review>

Nate, Dave, Ryan and crew have been professional and friendly, well done mates. Course is exponentially in better condition with new ownership, tip-of-the-cap. Golf is about scoring and the current putting surface of the greens doesn’t promote/reward solid putting, way too slow - rolling at 7 maybe 7-1/2. Greens need thinned out and height dropped or rolled. Actually can keep mowers at current reel height to protect grass but make them faster and roll much more “true” by simply rolling them consistently. Target stimp of 9 to 9-1/2 is ideal and would speed up play.  Fairways and green surrounds a bit too wet and fairways and tees need more consistent mowing to produce a consistent-performing course. Cup cutting is poor, not done properly leaving “volcanoing” around cups and crooked pins, easy fix with proper training (volunteer my services for that). Overall leaps and bounds better than 2-3 years ago but work still to be done. 12-15 maintenance staff along side Ryan (and he didn’t ask me to say that) and Dark Horse could once again crack top-100 courses in the country.<//review>

This place is Amazing and I would give more stars if i could. From the beauty of the course to the friendly staff on course, the entire day was top notch. My brother and I took  our sons out for the first time golfing yesterday, the entire staff of guys were excited for us to be experiencing that there. They gave the kids free snacks and made sure we were good to go for the day. The entire drive home my boy wouldnt stop talking about next time... so see yall again soon<//text>

<Review>Beautiful layout and the course is in great shape.  New ownership working out kinks, but always friendly and genuinely care that your experience matches the quality of the course.  Wish I lived closer so I could play more often, but drive from El Dorado Hills is tough.  Course and scenery is the best in the Sacramento area, would play here every day if I could.  Wanted to leave a bad review so Dark Horse remains a secret, but can't do it, too nice a course.

Just an awesome spot. The location is set in rolling hills with oak forests surrounding the course. The new owner, Randy, is doing lots of upgrades to the whole thing. He's a really nice dude and his laid back style makes your visit a real pleasure. His lovely daughter, Stephanie, runs the beverage cart and is a real sweetheart. Corey is a great guy and made us feel very welcome. We did the Havest Host dry-camp with our 5th wheel trailer and had plenty of room to stretch out.

The only downside of our trip had nothing to do with Darkhorse, it was the highway roller (Pereira, badge 7270) who dogged us going over the vehicle-with-trailer speed limit of 55 mph on I-80. He also scolded us for passing in the one-lane (that 3-lane is a hazard with a half-foot deep rut in concrete - maybe they can use my $125 fine to help fix it). And, he didn't like my Chevy's OEM towing mirrors (not wide enough for him). He said he'd be "gentle" (we didn't know we were in "Deliverance" country, and we're not the "Millers"). On the way home at 55 we were a impediment to traffic - even the Walmart semi trucks were blowing by us. The saving grace for the CHP was officer White (a Boston Red Sox fan) who was really great in helping us find a necessary alternate route ( don't go on Dog Bar Road with a 5th wheel). What a cool guy - took the edge off that ticket.

Overall,  it was a super fun weekend adventure. We can't wait to go to Darkhorse Golf Club next season. Thanks to the whole staff and Officer White for making our outing a great time!

Make sure you have breakfast at the Sunrise Cafe at Higgins Corner. Great family  owned business with tasty food and friendly staff.<//Review>

<Review>I played Darkhorse quite a few years ago and enjoyed the course then, but with the new ownership, this course is in immaculate shape. Especially considering we are in the middle of winter, the conditions were fantastic. The rolling hills make it almost unwalkable, but the unique holes and beautiful views make up for it. The mountain scenery is to die for and nature’s sounds transport you to a peaceful state of mind.

The warmup range is great and the staff is extremely friendly. The sand bunkers are the best I’ve ever played in with soft white sand, and the greens are true but forgiving. Being a 19 handicapper, I played off the blue tees and felt good about the mostly wide fairways that allowed some err in my drives. There are some truly breathtaking tee boxes that make you question your club selection (extremely downhill or uphill)., and the meandering river is a welcome view throughout the course.

The pace of play was surprisingly slow for a Monday but I didn’t mind because an extra 30 minutes in the mountains isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Hopefully they will be opening a clubhouse soon as the current options are to bring your own snacks or hope the snack cart comes by in a timely fashion. (We only saw her come by once).

I look forward to coming again soon!! Well done Darkhorse!< /Review>< username>

As noted in previous reviews...under new ownership and they are working hard to get the course up to snuff. More than half of the bunkers are still under repair, but the tee boxes, fairways and greens were in great shape. The $89 green fee is high for the current conditions, but they offset the price with free cart refreshments and a complimentary round. So really...only paying $45 which is more than worth it. I cant wait to play again and looking forward to final repairs. Once complete...this track will easily be one of the best in the area. An easy 5 Star once they are done...</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Over priced, no clubhouse, you have to tote your clubs up the hill,they say drinks are included in the price(6 hour round and seen the golf cart once), social distancing was a joke.

<text>I was a member at Dark Horse in 2006.  The last year it was privately held before they had to let it go due to the financial crisis.  What a shame.  At that time it was still relatively new and immaculately cared for.  It's alway been my favorite course here in the Nevada County area and beyond.  The only reason I can't give it five stars is because they have yet to build a real clubhouse and rely on a mobile building to suit that need.  It's a fun yet challenging course where you can disappear on the course and forget about reality for 4-5 hours.  Isn't that what golf is all about?< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Played on a monday 9/23. The finished sand traps are outstanding,  but only about half were completed. Lots of tree trimming, brush removal and new bridges on all crossings. Green were in great shape considering they're still upgrading many of the greenside bunkers.  Fairways need to be over seeded, tee boxes  have not been improved yet.
We had an enjoyable round but have to say for $90 around there is a bit of room for improvements.  Staff on sit were very engaging and helpful.< /Review>

Darkhorse is a fun layout, though definitely not a walking course.  Well worth the drive out to the somewhat remote location.  There are usually great deals for this place, too!   My main gripe is that I have called on numerous occasions to ask about course conditions (before driving all the way out there) and rarely do I ever get to talk to a human actually AT the course!  Either it's the recorded message or some attendant who isn't on-site and has no idea of current conditions.   One other thing...on the website, Corey Campbell should be the General MANAGER, not MANGER.  :-)</text>

<text>Booked a tee time on Thursday May 30th for Saturday June 1st. I had played the previous Saturday (May 23rd) and really enjoyed the course. I prepaid through GolfNow, and planned my 2 hour trip down from Reno. I called about an hour in advance to my tee time to see if they were running on schedule, at which time the woman on the phone tells me they're now closed for the day.

I told her I had already booked (two days earlier) and paid in advance. She then tells me to contact the third party service I booked through and get a refund. No explanation of why they were closed, no offer to help, nothing. They wouldn't have even told me until I showed up if I hadn't randomly called in advance. Pretty weak customer service. I come down and play golf in the foothills all the time from Reno and have never encountered anything like this before. Luckily I was able to book a last minute round and save my day at The Ridge in Auburn, another course I love.

Ultimately, I found out that they were closed because new ownership had taken it over and that it had closed for remodeling. This is totally understandable, had they not been accepting prepaid tee time bookings less than 48 hours prior to closing for remodeling.

As you can see, the owner has chosen to tell me all the things GolfNow did wrong, but not accepted responsibility for their own actions. The course hadn't been closed for 2 months at that point, I played it the weekend prior and have the GolfNow receipts to prove it.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Carts need GPS and new seats.  Course eat half my balls and kicked them as well.  Views were amazing along with the wildlife.  The neighboring dogs could be a bit distracting but all things being considered, don't expect to score well, you will tho have a beautiful day.</text>

<text>Man this course is tough to play. It’s scenic and there’s tons of wildlife i.e. turkeys, deer, squirrels and some snakes too.

The greens are tough the price is right for what this course offers. The place is off the beaten path but again you’ll like it I think.</text>< pictures>

<time>1523000283257< /time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>Played there today 4/5/18, one of the worst golf experiences ever. I usually play here expecting a great time and excellent conditions. I was wrong today. To start off the person working the pro shop was absolutely terrible. Did not even say hello or barely acknowledge me when I checked in. The greens were aerated but to the point of almost being unplayable. I tried to purchase 2 beverages at the turn and the same “pro shop” employee ignored me completely. As I was leaving the bar area a very helpful employee named MATT addressed my concerns and went out of his way to help my brother and I get some beverages. He was excellent even though you could tell that was beyond his scope of duties, and the whole staff at this course should take notes from Matt. I drive all the way from Sacramento and today the experience was quite less than “par”</review>< pics>

Great service! Thank you Jen Z! We had an early for us dinner. Upon entry we were greeted with smiles, it was super packed o we got to choose where we sat. After going through the menu options I decided on baby back ribs (recommended by Jen) and my other half decided on a 2 meat plate, friend chicken and hot links. We got a half order or okra to share, it’s always delicious! Oh and peach and cherry lemonade, it comes in this massive jar 😃. The food came out just on time and we grubbed like we hadn’t eaten all day. Of course we had to have dessert so we got the peach cobbler 🤤. Because it was my other half’s first time it was on the house, what a nice gesture. 10/10! I’ve been coming here for ten years and I’ll keep coming as long as it’s here. Great food and service all around. And the location is nice too.<//text>

Not the best southern food I've had in California but pretty close. This joint is good but with lots of room for improvement. But to be fair to this establishment, i will try another meal with hopes that it brings that fifth star out of me.</Text>

Easter dinner and the bbq melts in your mouth!  Dine in booth style. Quiet homestyle atmosphere. Over Easter dinner here, I became inspired to plan our wedding and honeymoon. You bet we will be here to celebrate. Most of all.... We were welcomed with a smile and food tastes homemade. Great service!< /Review>

I ordered take out from here after seeing they offer southern made dishes. My order was the smoked chicken salad. The salad includes bacon, tomatoes, green onions, and cheddar cheese with ranch dressing. The salad comes with a side of cornbread. The salad was good, and the cornbread was delicious. It was moist and flavorful. It didn’t taste bland or hard. The lettuce was crisp, green, and it didn’t look withered. I didn’t interact much with staff because it was a quick pick-up. The place has its own parking lot. This is a good place to get a taste of southern eats.</text>

<Review>My husband and I love this place and we have missed being able to "dine in" and chat with our favorite employees. Now they have an inviting add on porch for dining.

I hate to write a not so good review. My order was wrong went back once was missing greens & okra. Went home and was missing mac n cheese & peach cobbler.  Spent over $100 and was missing items. An unfortunate for Mothers Day.....Flavors were ok. Okra is your average pre-made frozen, disappointed. Greens are heavy on vinegar. Meat didn't have enough bbq sauce make sure you order extra.</Text>

<Text>Wow this place used to be good or my taste buds have changed to start off parking is akward and what happened to the peanuts shells on the floor. The food is sub par, if your going to focus on the southern part change your barbecue sauce for starters and the ribs felt like they were made in the oven and not on a grill.</Text>< pictures>

Bought a family meal and was left absolutely impressed! The BBQ is fantastic! And the BBQ pork and chicken were cooked to perfection. Can't wait to come back and order more!</Review>

<user_name>Anony Mous<//user_name><review>DefinitelyNEGATIVE stars.. has this place gone to the dogs.
I ordered to go not to long ago. The order was packed with no BBQ sauce no napkins no forks.. French fries cold and rubbery.
NOW.. we can't get them to pickup the phone.
We show up in person and stood in the front.. waiting to be acknowledged.  And there is literally NO ONE for a good 15 to 20 minutes.  Not an employee of live person anywhere near. The all are rushing out to the patio area. Not a moment to acknowledge a customer.
I have eaten here for over 20 years.
And I think I will never return<//review><user_id>113933442385005309995</user_id>< Date>

Ok, here it is , in my honest opinion this place has declined slightly as I remember the days when there was saw dust on the floor, it just seemed more wholesome overall. I'm aware that during this pandemic that things are different as far as in house dining but whether you're dining in or ordering take-out the quality would not be affected. Just my opinion.< /review>

<Review>Many restaurants have stepped up during the COVID crisis. This one has not. It pains me to write this review. The customer service was horrible and so was the food. Typically, the restaurant shows southern hospitality and great fall off the bone meats. I ordered the ribs and my wife ordered the bbq chicken. Unfortunately, the ribs and chicken were dry- like super dry, like frozen or old overcooked meat. The Mac and cheese was super salty. My side of vegetables seemed to be the only well prepared dish. My family would eat at this restaurant a few times a year and always left satisfied. In full disclosure, I reduced  5 star rating to 2 stars because of this experience. I hope Johnny arena gets back on track sooner then later. Note to staff: if you are frustrated then please keep in mind that so are your customers- so step up don’t step down.< /Review>< pics>

Their spicy chicken was actually spicy. Huge spicy chicken sandwich. Got it delivered and everything was packed nicely. Only thing I’d comment on is I ordered sandwich plain but still got it with coleslaw, no big deal. It was delicious!<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Great southern vibe with a staff that seems truly happy to serve you. I love the road side rib joint feel of the building and though the decor has some southern charm to it, seemed to be a little over the top.
The ribs are smoked to perfection and you can taste the love in them. I wish they did offer other sauces but do have a kick ass hot sauce.
It is pricy here for sure and that's my main issue with this place. My ribs were $26 and only come with one side. I got a salad and it looked a little underwhelming.
That said the setting, friendly service, and smoked meats make this place a four star option.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPx1aiyYOSxosezE0Tl_05ubP3RduT00eGvomyy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-Y_Br-VmTrCpcx2edPOzxmChBszqLQ5CQz80z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpTYPoxbDRofH60BKEJSpCNw-gTOlTaK-Wakpc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwmbD7I2shVOYGHIyFui2BN-0Sa8T6NHUyGRCJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaUKTqARv-ElPLxlPCvRmn-WinP7ydBq33cfsM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dd33705e5c8d3b:0xed7912c503ab4834</gmap_id></record>

It was super bowl Sunday so it was especially busy, we had to wait a bit for our food because of a large party of people but when our food came out it hot and fresh.

Food was pretty good and so was the Cherry lemonade. Fast service and very friendly staff. They told us if something wasn't to our liking, they'd fix it. Really good people. The only thing that I didn't like was the peanut shells under all of the tables.< /text>

I DON'T understand the hype. We purchased the mother's day special, great deal btw, but the food is basic. It doesn't carry the amazing amount of flavor I normally taste in BBQ. I am from Kansas city and lived in Texas the past 5 years so coming from such states with really high standards on what they call BBQ may be why I think the food I had was not very good.

The staff was nice and the atmosphere pleasant.<//Text>

Johnny Reb's never disappoints! Today I had the catfish salad, fried not blackened, and I ate the whole thing! We also had a side of hush puppies and 6 baby backs to start. Everything was delicious as usual! The service was fast and the staff was so attentive. This place is great!<//review>

<text>Like the name says "Welcome to True South".  Very good food, and service, Americana style. We order a plate with kitchen and the two pieces were kindda small, hence the 4 stars. Service was friendly and the toilets were clean. All and all a nice, neighborly feel to this place.<//text>< Rate>

<Review>Customer service was great, friendly people but stick to breakfast. I bought the family platter, ribs and chicken, BBQ sauce will only take you so far. The meat (ribs & chicken) no flavor at all, guess the seasoning is in quarantine. Was very disappointed in the food, love their breakfast but dinner not so much. This BBQ won't make you slap your Mama 😂!</Review>< Pics>

I'm in Edmonton Alberta Canada right now but I like to watch the car chases in Los Angeles here in Edmonton. Near the end of the pursuit tonight the helicopter guy mentioned that he likes Johnny Rebs and that the chase had just ended near there. You should give him a free meal for his plug of your restaurant as he said it's one of his faves. Cheers!</text>< Pics>

It's almost a whole in the wall/shack with its size. Parking is doable but can get crowded. The service is always fast and friendly. I haven't tried everything but the Jalapeno Hush Puppies, Pulled Pork Fries, Grits, and Old Fashioned Fried Chicken are good. I didnt like the biscuits and gravy however. The gravy needed a lot of seasoning but the biscuit itself was good. They were able to comp it and offer me an alternative selection with no issue.</text>

This is a hidden gem! From the outside and the surroundings, I questioned my friends decision on taking us here. But the second you walk in you are warmly greeted and the food is amazing! Besides the brisket being incredibly flavorful, and the boudin balls to die for, the service was exceptional! Our server was Kevin and he did an amazing job. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Long Beach.<//text>

< Review>
Johnny Johnny Johnny...what more can I say other than they do food and hospitality well. Entering the place you get a very country southern feel as well as hospitality. The seating is quite roomy for a smaller venue and the food comes out in a timely manner. The I had the Fried Tomatoes with topped with bacon and the French Beignets. Each dish was okay and both were priced well so theirs no complaints. In addition to the appetizers I had the Bacon and Eggs with Fried Potatoes. The potatoes are very good close to southern style taste. As for the restroom it's coed and its very clean especially being that men and women are sharing the same restroom. The parking is suspect especially if it's busy and it has a one-way entrance that you may pass if you haven't been to the establishment. With that said I recommend this place to anyone visiting Long Beach, CA or who lives in the area. It's an overall good experience.

I was raised in the south and this was the best southern food I ever had in SoCal! They sweet tea was right, the chicken and waffles are to die for. The portions are huge! I still dream about this food even though I'm back in the south now.< /review>

Horrible meal.... Must have changed owners. I should have cancelled my order when i tasted how bitter the iced tea was. I asked for water, telling the waitress the tea was unbearably bitter but they still charged me almost 4 dollars for it.  Meat was clearly baked or boiled with no seasonings and covered with blah sauce. Corn bread was tasteless and dry. I filled up on the frozen sweet potato fries and left. Ill stick to the Bellflower location!<//review>

Not sure why people write big ratings for them.. Has nobody ever been to the South has nobody ever been to Texas and had dry rub smoked ribs..  Or smoke brisket or chicken.. This place does not even come close.. Sorry just because you put tons of sauce on everything  To cover up  bad barbecue does not make it good barbecue.. Very amateur  I don't care if you have the worst service on the planet and the worst waitresses or waiters if the food is that great I don't care about service.. Ultimately it's about the food.. My mother's side of the family is from Texas this is not even close.. Unfortunately californians have no idea what good barbecue is..< /Review>

As always, it's very good. North Carolina style barbecue isn't my favorite.  I prefer the barbecue sauce cooked on the ribs. Hence the 4 star.< /review>

I love the swamp water and fried pickles. Half order next time for 2 is going to be perfect. My daughter ordered the pulled pork and loved it. I had the Hot Nashville Chicken sandwich. It was good, but very greasy and it completely soaked the bottom bun. It was just a flat piece of dough by the time it came to me. But it was spicy and yummy. The spice brought tears. Wait staff very helpful, kind and on it. Always good, but sad about my soggy bun. Lol<//Review>

<text>NOT SOUTHERN BBQ AT ALL. Just ordered the Burnt Ends, mashed potatoes, and hush puppies. This was closer to cafeteria food then southern bbq. Burnt Ends were so tough it was like chewing on bubble gum. Instant mashed potatoes should come with a warning label.  An the hush puppies were the biggest joke I've ever seen. They were packed so tight they were unedible. Whole experience was a let down.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

It's my first trip and I really didn't know what to expect. I got there kind of late, almost closing. But everyone treated me as if I got there where it first opened. The food was hot and 'damn good'. I've been to many of BBQ 'shacks' ('shacks' with respect) and Johnny Rebs' s up there with the best of them. If nothing else, check them out america.<//review>

After looking for a restauraunt that served  beef ribs. We traveled to this restaurant which stated they are no longer' Johnny  Rebs,  "but "True South," We traveled from the beach 20 min  for the beef ribs , and there was none...We were told to come back on Fri,  Sat, Sun...Our waitress told us about the 50% off(within  7 days, with receipt).We went back on designated days for ribs (Sunday), and we were told they had run out on Saturday and the 50%was only valid on the exact same meal within the seven days , not aware of this we had come back a second time again ordering a meal we did not want...Ninety dollars later, we still have yet to have a beef rib. Sides were good, coleslaw excellent, overall friendly, comfortable, and nice atmosphere,  we hope third time around we will have those beef ribs....< /Text>

<text>Came here for dinner on Friday and ordered the 20 ribs and 2 sides for $20. The ribs were smaller than I was expecting - which I guess makes sense since it was 20 ribs for $20. The ambiance and service were fantastic. Would definitely return, but maybe I'll try something else.</text>< user>

<review>Very disappointed they change management.. I believe.. The food doesn't taste the same didn't have enough seasoning in the greens and the Grits were horrible with no seasoning and the ribs seem like they're just baked or boiled with this thick horrible tasting BBQ sauce... and the peach cobbler had a old school biscuit crust was not good at all. The whole experience was very disappointing they should have kept the same recipe ingredients.<//review>< Pictures>

I've been coming here since they opened and they're food is always excellent! The wait staff is always awesome and friendly as are the rest of the staff. Best thing I've found on the menu? Fried chicken. Throw in some sweet potato fries and you're in hog heaven. Jeans and tshirts are the clothing option, or come dressed up, it doesn't really matter and you'll fit right in. :)  Just make sure to get there early because the seating is limited and they get BUSY!!!</Review>

<review>I have been going to Johnny Reb's for years.  I love the chicken fried chicken. The food is great and the service is great. I did notice that before they raised their prices, there was always people waiting outside for seating. Now with the higher prices, the last few times I went, there was no wait. I love the food and good serving sizes. Overall 5 stars.</review>< rating>

Everytime I have ever been here the food was awesome. It's a fun place to go with the buckets of peanuts on the table and throwing the shells on the floor. Drinking beers our of Mason jars. We use to get breakfast take our when I lived a couple blocks away and it was also great.< /Review>

Really really good food. Banana pudding is A MUST every time. Ribs were delicious. Server was very attentive and great. My kids love this place. Servings are large so we usually share meals, ordering 3 meals between 5 people.... Still bring food home.</Review>

Johnny Rebs' is authentic southern cooking at its best. I had the bbq  pull pork,and baby back ribs which was so tender and flavorful. Whether breakfast,  lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong. The best of the best!< /text>

I have been coming here for over 20 years and I am never disappointed. The food is always great. My favorite is the catfish and grits, beef ribs or the blackened catfish, with the swap water. I do miss kissing the pigs butt.</text>

Took my grandson for celebratory graduation meal. The server was very nice n the meal was great, as usual- she even gave him a happy graduation treat. A delicious peach cobbler dessert. (Unlimited peanuts to eat b4 meal, n shells go on the floor.)</Review>

They have a niche here in California though, as there is not a lot of southern themed restaurants serving items such as grits, southern style. I wasn't as impressed with the food for the price. That would be my overall gripe. The service was good. The atmosphere wasn't bad.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>Menu and value have changed. Sandwiches are now a la carte but the prices are still the same. Fixins (sides) are extra and come in single and shareable sizes. The larger size is the same as what was previously served WITH your meal. Our sandwiches used to be tall and loaded. Today's were very small and still over $11 on their own. Friendly service but they lost me with their new price model and smaller portions.< /review>< pictures>

I've been going to Johnny Rebs' to get a little south in my mouth since I was a hungover early 20 something year old enjoying their food Sunday mornings. Now I'm 39 and I STILL  enjoy them, but any day of the week. Talk about delicious Southern food!< /Text>

<Review>I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  The food was to die for.  I ordered a combo plate of pulled pork, BBQ beef, mashed potatoes and fried okra.  There was also corn bread with real kernels of corn in the bread.  Crisp and tasty.  I was very impressed with the fried okra and mashed potatoes...both were excellent.  The portion was hearty and plenty for myself.    There are REALLY tasty peanuts on your table, you throw the shells on the floor.  The sweet tea comes in a mason jar and is just sweet enough.  The service was outstanding.   This has become my favorite place to eat out...can't wait to try the fried catfish and BBQ ribs next time.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Awesome staff. Unfortunately by far the worst bbq I've ever eaten. They don't season the meat at all, just drowned in sauce. The mac and cheese will make you vomit. However my son's chicken was really good. Way over priced for food that disgusting. I really wanted to like the food cause of the staff. Just sad.< /Text>

<review>I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken with collard greens and mac n cheese for pick up and it was ready within 30 min.
I arrived late because I wasn't expecting it to be ready so quickly.
The only issue was that they had given me mashed potatoes instead of the collard greens I'd ordered, but the hostess was very nice, confirmed my original order and got it fixed right away. She even let me keep the mashed potatoes as a consolation.
Even though I'd picked up my food so late, it was still warm when I got it home and nothing tasted bad. The mashed potatoes turned out to be my least favorite item, even after reheating them. But they were passable. The mac n cheese was good, but the collard greens were exceptional. Meaty and tangy and hard to stop eating!
The biscuit was also very good and great with honey.
I'll definitely order again.<//review>< Pictures>

Just wonderful! Tastes just like we remember it from 26 years ago. We used to visit Johnny Reb's a lot when we lived in Long Beach in the 1990s, abs when we started planning a trip to this area, we knew we had to include Johnny Reb's in the places to go for nostalgia's sake. We were not disappointed. The fid was just as good as we remembered it, the people are still just as nice and the atmosphere still right outta the South!</Review>

Top three BBQ joints I have been to in the nation.

Got the sampler for two, each meat had a distinct smoked flavor proprietary to each respective cut.

Amazing biscuits, cornbread is moist and the service from Kevin left nothing to be wanted or questioned.<//text>

Southern cooking to heart! SOOOO yummy and authentic to southern style cooking. I really appreciate when a restaurant claims Southern style food and the taste matches just that! My family is from the South and this food is the real deal. You have to try it if you haven't yet.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Johnny Rebs is consistently great food. I've been eating here for years and have always had good service and food. Recently I brought my Texan boyfriend who complained he could not find true Southern BBQ. He really enjoyed his 3 meat plate and his okra and hush puppies. Highly recommend this restaurant.<//Review>< pics>

Chicken is WAY too expensive!  Wasn’t it for poor people in the past. I’m poor!  Why do I continually go back and bend over? Because, it’s some of the best chicken in Long Beach.< /review>

We were really excited to go eat at Johnny Reb's but the food just wasn't up to the hype I had a 3 meat combo pork ribs,shredded pork,tri-tip! Oh my God the tri-tip I would not have served that to nobody I would have been embarrassed to serve that to a customer it was paper thin dry tasteless the rest of the food just didn't have any type of flavor to it and was also overcooked my family's meals were just about the same as mine not very good I give it two stars only because the sampler platter we got was good chicken wings were very good onion rings were perfect fried pickles were very good and that's about the only reason I would ever go back for and a cold beer I'm not in the habit of giving bad reviews but when it's deserving i give good reviews I'm pretty picky because I also barbecue and  my family's say that they hardly ever eat as good as I make it a restaurants so do friends and family that I barbecue for.< /Text>

<Text>This place transports you to another place, when I dine here it really feels as though I'm in the south. Somewhere far away from a big city. Now the food speaks for itself, it is delicious and the lunch specials are definitely worth it.< /Text><name>Angela Jarillo</name><user>103414875750980017630<//user>< Rating>

<rating>3</rating><Text>I was a bit disappointed on this last visit to Johnny Rebs.  I've been coming here for years.. lately they have been making changes that are taking them away from what made them so popular in the past..particularly with their menu.  We all ordered fried chicken...  I ordered my normal fried chicken..it used to be 1/2 chicken..now you order 2,3 or 4 piece.. what you get is all over the place.. not a half chicken, but a mix of random parts.  And this time the chicken was anemic small and dry.  Our side orders were good.. but two of the four of us got the wrong sides.  Just not what I was hoping on this trip as I brought two friends from eng loo ad and raved to them about this place.. now my credibility and judgement has come into question.  I'm gonna take them to Gus' chicken in Hope's of redeeming myself.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dd33705e5c8d3b:0xed7912c503ab4834</Gmap_id></record>

Nice BBQ ambiance. WE ordered ribs, brisket, fried cat fish sandwich, tri-tip sandwich. My tri-tip for 16.+ change seamed kin of low on the meat side and the taste was OK. The person who had the fried okra liked it a lot.the service and peanuts were very nice. they seamed to move people in and out fairly well over a busy lunch time. all and all good time, but on the high side of cost vs value.<//review>

Make sure you get a copy of your receipt upon paying. They tried to have me pay twice. Embarrassing. Parking sucks. Food had wonderful flavor and big portions.</Review>

Visited for lunch. Popular place with the lunch crowd as, by the time we left, there was a fair amount of people waiting to be seated. I ordered burnt ends. Overall they were ok, some were a bit fatty. Not particularly pleased with selection (especially for the price $15). I should have gotten pulled pork... next time.< /Text>

Johnny Rebs is a staple for southern food and hospitality in Long Beach.

If you have a big appetite, come for dinner. If you want a little less, come for breakfast or lunch.

I recommend one of their crafts beers of the swamp water (tea and lemonade).</review>

First time there, very tasty especially the peach Cobbler not too sweat but sweet enough, down fall.... I asked for End tips, all I got was ribs no End Tips. The whole point is to chew on white bones....😥😮< /Text>

Trash!!! That's all I can say. I mean you can get a TV dinner that tastes just the same as their food for less money than what they charge</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Very disappointed. The meats were oven baked. No hint of smoke. The ribs, although a lot, were tasteless. The tri-tip plate was a few very thin slices of over-cooked unseasoned very tough meat. They dont serve the beef ribs anymore which is probably a good thing since the quality has gone way downhill. Guess I'll just keep smoking my own meats.</Text>< pics>

I've you have ethnic taste buds (Black, Latino..) and are used to flavorful food, skip this place. I took a chance, and regretted it. I got the Baby Back Pork ribs with Mac N cheese, mashed potatoes & the buttermilk biscuit. The meat is not seasoned and the sauce isn't good enough to make up for that fact. The Mac N Cheese is blah, Church's chicken has a better Mac. The mashed potatoes were ok, good. The biscuit was good with the butter & honey on it. All and all, I was unsatisfied, won't be going back here.

The staff was friendly though<//Text>

It was ok...i saw this restaurant featured on DD&D food channel.

So I had high expectations..

Although I've had better. It wasn't bad. It certainly deserved another try.<//Text>

Really enjoyed Johnny Rebs today. Food excellent tri tip super yummy with BBQ sauce, fixins greens great, sweet potato fries perfect, fried green tomatoes to die for, sweet tea the best, peach cobbler better than ever. The biscuits are divine. And of course peanuts in the shell galore-soooo satisfying to dump the shells on the floor ;p Everyone there was nice. Server could have been more attentive but he got the job done.</review>

<text>My husband and I had the best experience there! I got the dinner special that included fried pickles, bbq bowl, and peach cobbler for $15. My husband got the brisket on grits for $10. Both were soooo good, but what made it over the top amazing was the outstanding service! The hostess, Kevin our waiter, and the girl bussing tables all were incredible. The second I finished a dish or my water was close to empty, someone was there to take care of it. And you get to throw your peanut shells on the floor which was fun.< /text>< Pictures>

They were great with our 5 and 4 year old girls. Gave them free little toys and to top it off. They gave our girls free desert and my wife and I, a free peach cobbler. Their food is really good and worth the drive. If you're down in downtown Long Beach, it's worth the drive in.</Review>< pictures>

Non Vegetarians should go there, order anything BBQ related, and be delighted. A very cool little spot. Parking is pain but it's So Cal, take a nice stroll to your car after you ate everything on your plate. Don't miss this place.<//text>

Really enjoyed my dinners, lunchs and breakfast especially on my birthday in February at Johnny Rebs for 11 years at 3 locations.Yesterday was the first time I try Pig & Fries, yummy! It is French Fries and Pulled Pork. I enjoyed the fresh ingredients used in the Green Fried Tomatoes.
It's GREAT Southern Food made out here in the West Coast.</text>

Good ribs good sweet tea just don't wear sandals as  the peanuts on the floor will stick to your feet unlike sand on the beach and could get annoying... Good food good advice and make sure you get that southern sweet tea. You get free peanuts while waiting< /text>

So although this is one of the smaller locations the staff here is awesome. They're very attentive to their custimers. Although each table has it waiter/waitress. They all work together to make sure that you have an all around exceptional experience. They also have promotions to where you can come back for a future visit for a free meal for equal or less value of your prior order. Must keep the original receipt. They do not have very many vegetarian meal options. But you have a variety of actual vegetable side 's to choose from as well as some fish.<//Text>

<review>Yum!

So I have been craving for my Southern side, and went looking for some real good BBQ.  This place satisfied my needs!  Very southern feel to it - great service and felt that southern hospitality.  Remember - the peach cobbler a la mode is the best part!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Ordered the catfish breakfast plate and my husband received just ONE piece of fish for $20!
The beignets! 🤦🏽‍♀️ Ugh! It wasn't even a beignet! It was pocket of french toast. Oh the deception!
The lemonade is HORRIBLE 🗣
The creole shrimp & grits was just alright.
Clearly I'm not happy with my $62 worth of breakfast... Never will I order from here again!</review>

<text>I'm not usually a big fan of BBQ, too sweet, too heavy. But this was really good. The ribs are excellent, falls off the bone. Get the sauce on the side and ask for the Carolina sauce.</text><gmapID>0x80dd33705e5c8d3b:0xed7912c503ab4834<//gmapID><rating>4</rating>< Time>

<Review>Better make a good report so it will still be there next time I want to go. Loved the greens, hush puppies, and the catfish was ok. Kind of a strange taste to the seasoning but still good. Of course the ice tea is great and I didn't have to make it. :)</Review>< pictures>

Wonderful food, great service and a casual down home atmosphere. The peach cobbler with ice cream can't be beat. Prices are on the high side but the food is worth the expense. They are also a pokestop which makes waiting for food much nicer.< /text>

Pulled pork and tri-tip were decent, though the BBQ sauce was only okay, nothing to write home about. The half of the brisket that wasn't just fat and inedible was tasty. Cornbread had a weird taste and consistency, and you could tell the fries were made in the same (old?) oil as the catfish. Biscuits were good, but the banana pudding was only meh.</Review>

I'm gonna miss this place. From throwing peanut shells on the floor, to jalapeno hush puppies and GRILLED mac and cheese. All of the food is great here but, the rack of ribs is a standout. Don't forget to purchase a HUGE smoked bone for your dogs at home.< /Review>

Their chicken and waffles is the best I ever had. They had this jalapeño syrup that had the awesome sweet taste then at the end was a pop of heat. I can't wait to go back again.</Review>

Will never return.  Behaviour towards customers doing pickup is awful.  Will Never return.  And for being so pricey, with the cost of their fried chicken, you'd think they would behave courteously.  Not so!
Get your fried chicken somewhere courteous.< /Text>

I loved this place! My first time going in August and I has the BEST MASHED POTATOES and MAC N CHEESE and BISCUTS. I think the BISCUTS were my favorite out of everything. I love the vibes this places gives and very kind and attentive staff! I would definitely drive from San Diego back to Long Beach to eat there again!<//Review>

<Review>I tried this place for the first time and it was horrible. The ribs and brisket taste like it was baked in the oven with no seasoning. This is not Southern cooking. A waste of money and overpriced.<//Review>< username>

Very authentic Southern Food experience. They serve peanuts on their shells, which you can throw on the floor. Their corn bread is delicious. Last time I had the Bourbon Glazed Salmon and it tasted great.<//Text>

<Text>Don't let the prices fool you. This place is worth every penny!  I travel all over the US and I am a southern girl  this is some of the best bbq I have ever had.  The burnt ends with grits, the pork sliders, the cornbread and the jalepeno hushpuppies were amazing. Thank you for a wonderful meal.  Excellent job!!< /Text>< name>

<review>Not what it used to be. The last time I ate there (2008). The food, the drinks were great! No complaints. But when I went this weekend...the food was alright, the beer selection I did not like (they no longer serve New Castle) the bloody Mary is disgusting...it tastes like it had to much pepper and an overwhelming taste of celery. So gross. Would not eat at this location again...I'll drive to Bellflower</review>< pictures>

Good place to eat, Especially the Peach Cobbler,  But one Fault of the Restaurant is they do not Have STEAKS ON THE MENU.
Ribeye Smoked or Grilled would be great.</text>

The food is very good but you do have to wait quite a while before it comes. Meanwhile you can have all the peanuts you want and toss the shells on the floor.<//Review>

It seems the portions are 1/2-1/3rd what they were and prices increased. I'm sad.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Who ever wrote the reviews for this place has to have been starving cuz their food was so gross that I took one bite and refused to eat any more. They couldn t even get the peach cobbler right. They cooked it with nutmeg and no cinamen. Thank God they took the meal off our bill or I would have had a food fight. The fried pickles were great.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Unfortunately, the hostess that helped us on Saturday was on a bad mood. I understand that the place was busy and they were running full hands, but that's no reason to treat customers in such a rude way. We were not the only ones that had that unpleasant experience there... Many things need to get organized there for a smoother service, in my opinion.<//review>

Food was not good.  Service was amazing.  Chicken sandwich was very bland.  Onion rings were dried out.  Key lime pie was one of the worst I've had, not tangy, bland, not as good as from a frozen box.

Oh Johnny Rebbs, my dear Johnny Rebbs, you have finally lost your way. So sad.

But hey, the service still kicks ass.😃<//Text>

The portions are amazing, but the quality of the food is just okay. The brisket is a lot fattier than I would have liked.< /Text>

<Text>The chicken sandwich was a bit dry and didn't have much flavor but I took it back then got the chicken tenders with fries,they were really good I highly suggest them,however they dont give you alot of fries and their barbeque sauce is ok I'd personally rather have store bought ,SweetBabyRays but overall the chicken really made up for the dry sandwich,by the way i got the grilled chicken sandwich< /Text>< gmapID>

I've been going here since I was a kid,  And I can't think of any other restaurant that's so consistently good.  The prices are fair and the prtions are large, so come hungry and you'll deffinetly get your money's worth.  My reccomendation is the chicken fried steak.<//Review>

We love Johnny Rebs food. Today we did not have a great experience with our service.  After being neglected by our waitress,  another waitress ( I think her name was Cassidy  )stepped up and made things right.  After getting my own napkins,  we asked for help from the manager and Cassidy. All other visits here have been great!< /Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><text>We ordered BBQ chicken dinner and BBQ pulled pork dinner. We were  so disappointed!  The meats were not BBQ'd and not well seasoned,  they tasted baked in an oven. The white meat on the chicken was dry and a little stiff, obviously leftover as it had a taste of leftover chicken.  The BBQ sauce was delicious however!  I sopped the dark meat in the sauce to make it edible, I was so hungry and little else on the plate was edible.  The BBQ beans was runny chili, if there was BBQ sauce in them I sure couldn't taste it, all I could taste was chili.  The collard greens taste like it had pickle juice in them, but they were nice and down but I just couldn't tolerate the pickle juice taste.  The hush puppies tasted like straight up cornbread, no onion taste whatsoever, they were dense and just not hush puppies, I ordered the jalepeno ones but I got the regular.   The Apple turnover was ok, the crust was a little too dense pand the apples not quite done enough for me, the ice cream was delicious!  The restaurant is quaint in a friendly atmosphere, the staff rocks, awesomely friendly, the music great.  But overall I had a poor experience with the food, I will not be back because I like my meats either grilled on a gas or electric grill or charcoal grilled (my favorite); so, I won't be back!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Been coming to Johnny Rebs for many years.
Love the food and atmosphere. Always had super waiters. Today, though a minor thing has made me to decide to never go back.
Ever.
The prices are high and always have been but TODAY they crossed the line. All over a $2.50 charge the waiter didn't advise me of and just presumed upon me. Collard greens.
So I paid $31.00 for a HALF rack of BBs beans greens and ice tea. $31.00!
They got me this time but they've lost a loyal longtime patron. At Lucilles I KNOW in advance I'm getting ripped off. So I'll go there from now on. Good bye JB. will take my money elsewhere to "Put some South in my Mouth".<//Text>

<review>I've heard that this location has better food than at Bellflower.. having eaten here for the first time in 10 years I totally agree! The Bellflower location is very good, but the food at the Long Beach location was WOW! Brisket was cooked perfect, chicken wasn't dry, coffee was so good, biscuits were fluffier. Everything about this place is great, especially the decor; license plates and old concert posters. The seating is very limited, and the parking lot is all gravel with no defined spots. Still, I think this place gets my business from now on. I like the Bellflower one if I want to feel trendy, I like the Long Beach one if I want great food.</review>< time>

We usually have a very good, fun  experience there, but this time, the food was stingy and we both got sick. I'm sure it was just a fluke. We still love it there.< /Review>

After learning they put pork in the BBQ sauce we stopped eating there. (NOT pork eaters) After about 14 years we were encouraged to try the breakfast.  OMG, everything was delicious. TrI-tip was tender. Brisket was melt in you mouth good. Eggs were fresh. The grits and potatoes were yummy. The  biscuits were so good we had a moment of silence to savor the goodness. We dined sufficiently on $18 per person and even took some viddles home. Although they are still putting pork in the sauce, I would go back again and work around it. I would definitely say give them a try!<//text>< response>

And after reading this, we did not meet those expectations! And for this we are truly sorry. Did you happen to let the server or manager know that you did not like your meal?\nDid a manager stop by your table at any point of your visit?\n\nWhy leave and pay for something you did not like. We are in the people pleasing  business  and want guests to be happy we would  have been more than happy to find something you like or not let you pay for the meal you did not like.\nWe want all of our guest to leave happy. And I know this did not happen. Once again I apologize and hope to hear from you soon.\nSincerely\nGreg Gordon\nGM Johnny Rebs Long Beach'}</Resp>
