<Time>1615525945305<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>This place is absolutely wonderful. The gentlemen working there are all very professional. I had an issue with my sensor and they took care of it. The one who helped me listened to my concerns and even offered us (my children and I) to wait in the waiting room. Chairs were separated with a good distance to maintain the social distance. Thankfully it was just us three there so we didn't have to worry. I would absolutely go back there.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEWkKIiaPbHrskPtcq5QMG6bxaf-fXjjLrFGFK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5QF_T6unlpgL71alOdIU55UklcWqO6fUzbv4A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk3V0UMxTUKEeWoGvS8SFnyWtcZVwpxdWMPgdf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I went in to ask why my transmission wasn't shifting and they told me I just needed four new tires 😑. I spent almost $500 and found out the next day that the tires were not the problem. You will have a long wait because they are always busy. There's a jack in the box across the street, though, so that's nice.</review><Name>Naomi Funk< /Name>< gmap_id>

<username>Joseph Catalan</username><time>1616191981286< /time><rate>1< /rate><Review>On 2/11/2021 at around 10:30 am. I walked in hoping to buy a set of four tires. I really wanted good tires and expected to pay more for quality tires and faster service. A sales technician with the name of Emmett (Sorry for the spelling) assisted me. I asked for Michelin tires and he told me that I was looking into 1000 dollars for all four tires. I said under my breath
"oh man and Costco does it for 700". I know Costco does it for cheaper because of their sales and I expected to pay more at a specialty place like Big O Tires. What I didn't expect was Emmett's reaction. For lack of better words, he went off on me. He told me "Seems like you already made up your mind. We can't compete with Costco. Maybe they are giving you an older model, the ones we have come with 80,000 mile warranty".. and much more. After he was done ranting, I asked him why didn't he start with the fact that the tires come with such great warranty and they were a newer model? He went off on me again. He told me " No, I didn't have to begin with anything, you already made up your mind, its not my job to convince you, etc". I began to walk out the door and in the process I told him that he needs to work on his customer service skills. His response was "its the way I am".
Maybe I was wrong to bring up the Costco price but maybe if his attitude would have been more positive, maybe I would have splurged the money and gotten my tires there. I was willing to skip lines, wait time and the hassle, I was already there. If Emmett would have said something along the lines of "You know they might be more expensive here but you get new model tires, 80,000 warranty, and we can have it done for you in one hour or two" I probably would have said, lets do it. Too bad for Big O tires, they lost a loyal a customer due to this individual and I hope other customers never have to experience what I did.
I ended up getting my tires at a nearby shop and spent as much as I would have at Big O Tires. The difference? A sales technician who actually cared to sell me a set of 4 Michelin Tires.</Review>< Pics>

I would never come here if your a single woman or from out-of-state. I came to the shop early Saturday morning for an oil change and possible  front brakes. They only had one car in the beys. All of the technicians were leaned up against equipment not working. The customer service guy saw me walk in and an older hispanic guy behind me. He completely ignored me and went straight to the other guy. I waited about 10 minutes listening to them talk in Spanish before I left. I came back about 10 minutes later same scenario different customer. I had my non expired coupon for the oil change at $49.99. The CSR finally called me to the counter. I explained what I wanted. He took down my information and went outside to check my mileage. He came back in and quoted me a price of $138 for the oil change before all of the additional fees. He claimed that my truck took an extra quart of oil that was going to cost me $20 extra, the coupon for that store expired yesterday despite the print and because I was from Nevada an extra charge was added. Totalling everything to about $178 for an oil change. The wait time would be almost 2 hours because the guys are very busy and the rest of the crew hasn't came to work yet. I explained that I have never paid more than $65 for an oil change ever. I was told to go back to Nevada where it's cheaper. Not knowing that I am born and raised here in Long Beach. As you should know they didn't get my service. I got it done at a great price, no additional quart charges (assumptions make fools out of people. I have a small 3.6L engine not the HEMI) and was straight forward in what I needed. I would never reccomend this establishment to single women or out-of-state travelers. They will try to cheat you.</Review>

<Review>Stay far, far away from this place. I went in for one service & was trying to be up sold on a repair. Asked what the price on part & labor. Price on part was 4x the cost. I declined the repair & they attempted to charge me a  inspection fee without consent. They had my car half the day without a phone call. Manager was also a total jerk.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1605305698096, 'text': 'Hi Max we appreciate your feedback and would like to help.

Had an 8 AM appointment, shop was not prepared to service an 8 AM appointment.
5 or 6 cars needed to be moved out of all the service bays prior to my appointment, 25 minutes later at 8:25 they were prepared.
I will never go back as Salvador Garibay the opener does not prepare and does not care about wasting my customers time.< /text>

Horrible customer service! Do NOT go here. If you go, ask questions and inquire BEFORE paying for any service they will turn you away with their treatment just for asking questions. I sent my partner to get a tire change, 2 tires and possibly front breaks. We didn't end up getting any services. Sal was very rude when i was asking him for the total cost and about the over $100 charge for labor on 2 brake pads, he began to get defensive and told me that i can "go somewhere else for my services" he also had someone to go to my partner and ask her to leave the location because she was "taking up space and not getting serviced." They are still struggling with their customer service, looking at all reviews, they have been for a while and something needs to change.</Review>

<review>I was very pleased with the very excellent service which I received.
I made an appointment.  I arrived on time.  Within 3 minutes after I gave my keys to the service manager, my car was on the lift and being serviced.  This impressed me especially since the shop appeared to be filled to capacity.  I was very pleased at how fast my car was serviced which included the installation of 2 new tires and tire rotation.  This is the 2nd time that I have purchased tires from this shop.   I  appreciate the level of service which includes a very reasonable price for the tires.  I complimented the service manager and told him that I go out of way to come to this shop to do business.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Not only they have reasonable rates, they care about their customers.
The Big O tire guy was acting like he is doing me a big favor by taking all my info, charge a $25 bill for a flat tire and asking me to wait for 1-2 hours.
Big chains like these don’t care. But small businesses like these are awesome.
Support Local businesses.< /review>< pictures>

Went in to do a simple leaky tire patch.  It cost $25. There was a 3 hour wait, but if you go in the morning, it shouldn't be bad. They at least gave me an accurate time estimate.

<Review>Great customer service. Emmet was super friendly and helpful and went out of his way to help me make a claim against the online car seller I bought my car from for new front tires! I would definitely shop there again because of him.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<text>TERRIBLE customer service. When I called I was placed on hold for 5 minutes and I hung up and called back and he told me he had 3 people in front of him and 2 people on hold. So I hung up. Apparently one 1 person works there. So I finally was able to make an appointment for today. I went in and the gentleman sitting there was on the phone. Didn't acknowledge me at all. Not a smile, not even eye contact. Then another man walked in and said he'll be right with me. He continued to do paperwork and walk around working. Phone rang and he went AND TOOK THE CALL!!! I was placed on hold when someone was standing there but when I was standing there he took a new call. I walked out I don't have time for bad customer service. I'll find a place that wants my business.<//text><GmapID>0x80dd316682a71efd:0x13c02da4a7910bb1< /GmapID><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>Had a super awkward experience a short while ago. I completed the survey they e-mailed me. In the survey, I made sure to let them know about my poor customer experience, specifically with Javier. So, what happens? I get a call from Javier to complain about my feedback. What company does that? Either the complaint went to him directly and he won't do anything about it or corporate sent the feedback to him and had him call me? So odd and awkward. In any case, the customer service here is weak. I've gone to other Big O stores and have had more pleasant experiences. Javier looked annoyed every time I had a question. He took a tone with me when I inquired about the status of my vehicle since it was taking longer than expected. Cold personality. The two times I've been here, they have one person working the desk. Wish I could get my money back. I don't recommend going to this specific location.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>I sent my wife to do a oil change with a coupon that we got in the mail. We were happy to save some money. But when she got to her appointment the guy at the counter told her its not going to be 30 dollars with the happy car service it was $55.00 because it was a full synthetic oil they put on my car a Nissan sentra 2013. I wanted conventional oil I don't care what the recommendation is. its just a RECOMMENDATION not required. very upset then they disrespected her by being so rude about the things the car needed done in service they just blew her off. I am not coming here.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

A good place for new tires. The price and service are great. They will get you in and out pretty quickly as well. You will not make a mistake by coming here at all. Highly recommended.</Review>

Look for sale he is awesome he took care of me grand total is like 2:49 I had 239 he made the difference of what I didn't have so I'm going to bring all the guys sandwiches when I get paid which equals about 20 bucks I'm spending more but it was totally worth it they made me welcome. Coffee magazines to read we need to do and they were really quick I had an interview at 2 p.m. I was even early they got me in and out and waited for delivery and I got there at 8:30 left there 11 and there was 10 people in front of me killer I recommend everyone go there that's what you get your tires tell him I sent you Bryce Rogers<//Review>

<Review>”Javier” who works at the desk and answers calls has the worst customer service I’ve encountered. Called the store to ask a few questions about my AC blower motor that was fixed at big o tires and broke in 5 months.

I called to ask about warranty on the AC and got the response saying they needed to see the invoice. I explained that I had the invoice in front of me and if there’s anyway to find out over the phone because I live far away.

The entire time I got responses from “Javier”  that made me feel like he didn’t want to waste his time on the phone, instead giving me short answers so I could hang up and he can go back to what he was doing.

Terrible customer service before I started doing business with them. Can’t expect anything better if I were to do business with them.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1562625624686, 'text': 'Vince, we are disappointed to read what you have described in your review as this does not resemble the helpful and valuable assistance we are known for.

They were okay. The staff were nice and I didn't have an appointment so I had to wait 3 hours. I just wish they would have told me about how long I would have to wait bc I would've left and then went back. I had to reschedule an appointment that I would have not been able to get in today. I got lucky and she just happened to have a cancellation. Super long wait without pertinent updates. I was able to use a coupon which saved me a lot of money.< /Review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>This review is long overdue.  I received an oil change about 4 weeks ago based on an oil change special for $19.99.  After looking at a few fairly bad reviews, I was slightly skeptical about going to this location.  However, I frequented the NTB Tire and Auto Center in Atlanta, which is apparently one of their sister stations-- plus they were close to me--- and an oil change is fairly basic, so I figured I would check them out anyhow.  I must say, they did not let me down.  They had great customer service from the time I walked in and talked with the guy behind the counter to the mechanics and everyone in between.  All were very nice, courteous, and respectful.  They finished the job extremely fast.  Showed me specific problems that needed to be fixed and how soon. The head mechanic even replaced a light bulb on the rear of my vehicle, that unfortunately had been out for some time, for free.  The work/service was good.  Car performed well afterwards. No hassle. Easy breezy. Great price!< /text>< gmap_id>

Waited at 8 am opening time behind several other customers.  I had a rim and a tire to mount on it. All I needed was the tire mounted.  They told me 2 hour wait time  at least.   I went down the road a half mile and had the job done in 10 minutes for 10 bucks.   They didn't seem to care about my business or the fact I was traveling and needed some quick simple help.  I wouldn't go there for anything after this.</Text>

Went there and had 2 tires replaced.  After getting home my tire pressure sensor on the dash said that I needed to have the sensor serviced. Before going there everything was working fine. When they checked the tires they said one of the sensors was missing, which just so happened to be on the tire they replaced. I said so where do we go from here. How do we fix this. I was told that they could order me another one. I told them that we shouldn't have to pay for another one since everything was there until we got our tire changed. His response was that they dont remove tire sensors. I told him everything was fine until we went there. And we argued back and forth for a while.
I will never ever be going back there again. The person who changed the tire either knocked it off and they lost it or it was stolen. Worst customer service as well< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Do not bring a classic car here! I brought my 1960 ford ranchero here a few days ago, I drove my car on the freeway and noticed a strange noise. I decided to lift my car and inspect it, this being a unibody car a dent in the floor can throw off the alignment since all of the weight of the car is supported through the body and floor of the car. I found that the mechanic disregarded what I told him about how to lift my car. I told him that he must lift at the pumpkin and support the car with Jack stands at the rear subframe between the torque boxes and the mount of the leaf springs in order for the rear end to drop. I have taken my tires off many times without damaging my car this way. He decided to put the Jack stands under the rear floorpans and smashed the sheet metal floor supports and put some large dents in my floor. I called them and got a bunch of excuses and bs. I built this whole car, don't try to bs me! This is not going to be easy to fix, not cool.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Don't bother making reservations online, they can't even promise your reservation nor the type of tires you requested due to "computer problems". Instead, they'll try to sell you crappy tires. Such a waste of time.<//review>

< review>
On Feb 21, 2015, I purchased 4 new tires at the location at 9075 Artesia Blvd, Bellflower, CA. I also purchased, according to my receipt a "Tire Protection Policy" for $84, under which the receipt says "3 YR ROAD HAZARD WARRANT, 3 YR WORKMANSHIP WARRANTY, 3 YR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, LIFTIME PRORATED REPLACEMENT, FREE ROTATION/REBALANCE, LIMITED MILEAGE WARRANTY". I was told that the tire were prorated to 50,000 miles, and if they wore out before then I'd get a percentage back. That location has shut down, and I have since used the location at 1181 E Pacific Coast Hwy, Long Beach, CA. Last week, when I tried to get my tires rotated, the technician told me that two of my tires (which only have 21,000 miles on them) were too worn down and that it would do no good to rotate, and that I should purchase new ones. I asked the manager what the prorated warranty on the old tires covered, and he said what I currently have weren't covered by warranty because they are "performance tires" and don't list a mileage number "at the top of the receipt". He was also confrontational and rude about me even asking. So what did that tire protection policy cover? My whole family always buys from Big O, but after this, I think maybe we should be looking for a tire retailer that is not actively trying to screw us over.</review>

I came here after a long road trip and did regular maintenance and checks like oil change, tire rotate and balance, alignment, etc. Store associate called me to tell me some recommendations on top of what I came in for--which is fine--except one of those recommendations was that my back tail light was out. I said no thanks to all the recommendations bc I only wanted to get done exactly what I came in for. Later that night, after I had gotten my car back, I went to O'Reilly's and told them I needed a bulb for my back tail light (because it's cheaper there.) I didn't know which one was out so the store associate came outside with me and stood behind my car while I had it on and was pressing the brake pedals. He said none of them were out. So lesson learned kids...Big-O-Tires Long Beach lies.<//Review>

Do not get your car serviced here! I went in to get new tires and an oil change and then about a month later my car was out of oil. I returned and did a synthetic oil change thinking maybe I put too many miles on it and then another month later my car was shaking and feeling like it was going to shut off mid drive. I checked the oil and again and there was not even a drop left! I paid $79 for a synthetic oil change and they literally didn't do anything. I got a friend to do an oil change and   another surprise found out that they never even changed the filter,it was the original one my friend put on about 4 months ago!! They took it off and retightned it so tight it was almost impossible to take off. Total RIP off and very expensive for a waste of time and money.</text>

They are intelligent because they are very polite individuals which makes them appear concerned.
But they claim things about the car that are simply not true
Why?
I can only assume they want to charge you more $$$$$$$
I was told a few ridiculous things
FIRST THINGS FIRST.........WHENEVER YOU ARE  TOLD THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOUR VEHICLE ALWAYS GET A SECOND OPINION
WHY?
Because you can compare prices on service and figure out if Big O Tires is a Big O Lie

Ok so I found a coupon online for discount oil change I called their number and was told to come in the mornings because it less busy
I followed the direction

The next day shortly after arrival and as soon the cars hood was popped open I was told that I had coolent mixing with my oil

I was a little amazed that the service provider could see that without inspection he must have X-ray vision to see into the engine -Amazing!

Then another service provider claimed that my oil cap was faulty
And they would not change the oil because of my supposed issue with coolent and oil mixture

I said ok

But then he said "we will do it but we shouldn't and the car will break down soon"

They changed my oil charged me the $24 and I went on my way

My father is a mechanic so on the drive home I called him and express the supposed issue
He educated me to get a second opinion but to look at the coolent to see if it needed Antifreeze or water

It was not low and after driving to a mechanic that offered free inspection the mechanic asked me where I was told this ridiculous information I said Big O Tires
He said can you imagine how many people fall for this kind of bullsh*t

So please don't get distracted by their kindness and politeness and Always get a second opinion

Oh the place that offered the free inspection is Mikes auto repair on Atlantic

Careful out there are many sharks wanting to rob you blind</Text>

I went this morning at 9:00am to get my tires rotated, and he told me 2 hour wait.  I  told the manager when I got there, I  wasn't leaving my car I would wait.  He was very rude about it,  I had my tires rotated some where else and it was only a 15 wait.  I wont be back to Big O Tires! !!</text>

THIS IS RPM NOT PPM, new crew GREAT SERVICE! I had a WONDERFUL XP with RPM! I am super picky & expect a lot, especially when it involves my hard earned $. I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED when Nick took the time to meet me personally and patiently helped me to understand the process start to finish. Very prompt at returning my calls and emails. It's so refreshing to have such a young man just be so kind, patient, courteous & knowledgeable!! IM SO PLEASED AND FEEL SO SECURE KNOWING MY INVESTMENT IS IN GOOD HARD WORKING HANDS. PPM IS GONE, THANK GOODNESS!! VERY VERY HAPPY WITH RPM! Also worth noting is Sasha. She's always on the ball. Great, smart gal! What a great team handling my property! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!< /text>

My frustrations with PPM are outlined as follows:

Poor customer service: Often times PPM does not post photos of inside of apartments, are not able to provide basic information about apartments such as square footage. There is not a direct line to speak with the person who is processing your application for questions. They will answer text messages, but generally only one text every 2-3 hours, and will only answer 1 question even if you ask 3. Overall very inefficient processing of applications.

False Advertising: Apartments that were listed as "available now" we found out may not be ready for move in for 2-3 months. Although a site may be listed as available, 7/7 properties that we requested already had approvals for other tenants to live there.

Generally not flexible: Unwilling to accommodate minor changes in rental agreements like month-month leases, unwilling to schedule showings on weekends. Move in dates listed set in stone, not open to negotiation.

Conclusion: I tried long and hard to work with this company to get an apartment as the application was fairly expensive ($84 for a couple) but it turned out to be a huge waste of time and money. As a traveling health care professional, I live in many different apartments nationally and appreciate efficient processing of applications and good communication. If any of these things are priorities for selecting your apartment, save yourself some money and a headache - consider other companies before PPM.< /text>

I'm just wondering how they are still open? This is RPM NOW, seems like they haven't changed a bit, same company with a different letter in it. It makes me bit nervous to go through them now. I'm giving one star for bad communication skills, not responding to me, and it looks like I am not the only one. If they don't respond now, what will happen when I apply and pay 150 bucks for us to get a place. Will we get a place at all? or will we be here 3 months from now still looking? No thanks, I will go through a smaller company. I do hope they get better with communication, and respond to who ever has applied already. Good luck to you all that are having to go through a mess just to get a place.< /Review>

<Text>I worked with PPM for years, and gave them thousands of dollars as my management company of three properties I own in Eureka. I found them to be very uncooperative when listening to my concerns, and even less cooperative when it comes to helping me keep my property rented. I was constantly having to list my own property and feed them the prospects.
The straw that broke the camels back, was their maintenance dept. Not only are they completely incompetent, they are rude as hell! DO NOT!!! let these people run your business for you, be proactive and lookout for yourself, its usually all you got. The worst of the worst, the accounting. And frankly isn't that what its all about, the money. Don't let them steal your money!  Renters beware, Landlords be warned.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

These people never get you apartments as promise. You repeatedly submit your paperwork, send them the check for the application fee, then they trick you into believing that you get the apartment, to stop returning your calls, then call out of the blue to say the apartment was rented. I find them to be very dishonest, the fee is non refundable, so they end up profiting from keeping all those application fees. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY, thinking they would help you get an apartment.< /Text>

If it were possible to give this barely legitimate company a rating using a negative number of stars then I would. However, a one star rating is the lowest I can give and even that seems generous. This is unquestionably THE WORST property management company I have ever been forced to do business with. I cannot overstate my displeasure with this company and every employee of theirs that I have ever interacted with. I seriously wish that God would call down the ten plagues upon the employees and representatives of this two bit circus act. Avoid at all costs.< /review>

This company charges $42 per application because that is how they make their money. They like to keep about 5 propertys that are never rented out so they can earn more money then renting them out. Just ask how long the apartment above the sea grill has been listed or look at their BBB reviews it's all there< /Text>

If you have the choice of another rental company, take it. My wife and I only went through them be we didn't. We talked to other companies  who were more professional and courteous than this one. But the houses were either out of our price range or they didn't have listings available for months. They had sour attitudes; they always sounded bothered by the fact we asked question about their listings. Some of their houses would stay online months, then when we applied for them they would say they had been taken by other renters but the listing would continue to stay online. On top of that they would take weeks to get back to us with a response which was mostly no. Use these people as a last resort, once you have no other options, that's what we did.< /review>

<resp>{'time': 1490988319997, 'text': "Salvador, we have tried to reach out to you but haven't heard back. I apologize if you found the selection process frustrating. We can feel the same way. We are an agent for the owner, not the owner. This means our job is to process applicants and make recommendations to the owner's of the properties of applicants. We unfortunately do not own any of the properties we manage which means that for the majority of properties, an owner makes the decision on the renter, not us. The rental market is extremely competitive which means there are multiple people applying for every property. Because of that, it can take some time to be selected.  In the future there may be a quicker way to place tenants, but as long as there are more renters than properties available, this is going to be the case.\n\nI also see you said attitudes of some of the staff was unpleasant. That is something we can fix. If you have dealt with us recently you should have noticed a difference. You created your maintenance request Saturday when our office is closed and we are handled it within 48 hours. If you still feel the same about your review thank you for your thoughts. If you think it would be fair to include some of your other experiences with us that were positive we would appreciate that as well. We appreciate you as a tenant and hope you have nothing but a positive experience with us moving forward."}</resp><Gmap_id>0x54d3ffecca610871:0x29d5b70d2e706720</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They're just going to steal your money. Don't bother. You're better off renting from a private owner. And to those who are looking to rent their house don't let ppm do it.<//Text>

The worst property management I've ever dealt with. My boyfriend has rented with this company for over 2 years. He's signed the papers and contracts needed stating that he is a tenant. When repairs were needed, ppm would never call his phone, only the other tenant who signed the contract as well. This would happen multiple times when repairs or maintenence were needed. We thought nothing of it till one day... when another property company called ppm to verify that my boyfriend has rented with this company, ppm said that he basically doesn't exist in our system and that his name isn't on the current unit's contract.. thus, preventing my boyfriend from being accepted to a new home that he was in first place for and something he so much needed. Thank you ppm. You have no idea how hard it is for someone to find a home in such a competitive area. My boyfriend and the other tenant BOTH have proof of the written contract and he will make several copies to prove he exists in your system..... just the fact that we even HAVE to do that is such a pain and isn't right. "Thank you for voting us best property management for 3 years in a row!" Complete lie, look at the amount of one star reviews this management has recieved. Do not waste your time and money with this management. I suggest look else where.</review>

I never leave negative comments for businesses BUT people need to know how horrible this company is! I have only been a tenant for 4 months and I am counting down the days until my lease is up! I have had problems with my bathtub faucet leaking very bad, it fills my bathtub up every day and clearly doesn’t drain well. A guy came out and said he would be back and it has been 2 months! I called last Friday and told them the problem is still their and they said they would send someone out......it’s been a week and I haven’t heard from anyone! My bathtub is growing mold now and yes the are aware of this which is a health issue! This company doesn’t return calls or try and help tenants. It is so sad how a company can get away with treating people like this. I will take fault because plenty of people warned me not to rent from them and I did anyways. I learned my lesson and I just hope people will please read all of these negative reviews and do not give this company business.</Review>

I'm going to start this review by saying that I am a very patient person. I have never spent time and energy in writing a negative review.

So, with that said, avoid PPM like the plague. I paid over $150+ on my application over four weeks ago. I called four days in a row and on the fourth day I called they finally told me that my application was still being processed after weeks of waiting. Do not wait for them to 'process' your application. Because PPM, myself and two of my other friends are now homeless. We are all very well off college students who can each afford a place of our own individually. Being very well off financially I never thought I'd say that I'm currently homeless. Thanks PPM.

The part that bugs me the most is that we have no idea whether we will be accepted or not. How long do we have to wait? Two or three months to find out? Chances are we will be denied for the house we applied for and then we will have to apply to another house which will probably take another month for them to process our application. I'm going to give them another call tomorrow and downgrade to a house that none of my roommates want. We are already invested in ppm so might as well. In the meantime I'll be searching for places to live on my own, which I should have done in the first place. But who knows, ppm may still surprise me. Until then this review stands. Do not go through PPM regardless of how much you want to live in the apartment/house they are renting out. Unless you have months to wait and money to blow on an application stand clear.

Your best bet to finding houses in Humboldt is through word of mouth. So post advertisements around churches and the co-op "seeking housing" and you'll probably get contacted by someone sooner or later. Better than going through PPM.

UPDATE: I spoke to Amy on the phone awhile back. She seems to be keeping this company together. Not only did she call me and tell me the reason why my application took so long, SHE FOLLOWED THROUGH and texted me personally a few days later about the rental I applied for. I'm adding an extra star for Amy.<//text>

< Review>
Very sketchy, had a routine maintenance inspection 3 months ago and passed with flying colors because I updated and fixed some things wrong with my rental.

The minute I go out of town, the landlord submits a request to have my place inspected again and PPM will not let it wait until I get back from my vacation so I can be there and ensure nothing of mine gets stolen.

Very Shady.< /Review>

LIES AFTER LIES!
Do not rent through PPM. Despite all other people saying it, since I've rented from them before I gave them the benefit of the doubt and applied through them again and it's been 1 1/2 years, paid application fee twice now and everything was ok til we stopped searching for a few months and just recently emailed them to add a property to our application just to be told we have been denied renting with them. Like what? Aren't y'all supposed to send out a letter or email explaining the reason. We have been approved renting with them for over a year and a half and out of the blue we found a place they finally have that is interested to us and they tell us we can't rent through them because we have been denied to rent with them without any explanation why. They take your application money just to screw you over. I guess they have been really messed up recently. I've never had an issue with ppm but I guess they really have been unprofessional. Do not waste your time with them. Save your money for a different property management. This one isn't worth it. Especially since our search has been over a year and a half with 2 application payments already. N it's $40 per application. BOGUS! SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM.

I can't believe they claim to have sent me a letter explaining why our applications been denied to rent with them in Sept 2017 when clearly, I would know if I received one. And we were told we have been approved to rent thru them back last year in April 2016 then never found a home we liked so we ended up having to pay the fee again n renew our application in may 2017 and told we are good but then now they claim we have been denied in Sept after our application was submitted?  Save ur time n do not deal with this so-call professional property management. 😠😠😠😠😠< /text>

Everyone gives PPM such a hard time, and I have no doubt some people have been left feeling treated unfairly. However, my experience with PPM has been nothing but straight forward and honest. Sure it took them a bit longer to approve my application, but they have 100s to process and it is ultimately up to the property owner to make a decision. I had issues with my laundry room being broken in to, they came that day and changed the locks. I foolishly locked myself out of my apartment and they were there within two hours to change my locks and provide me with a new set of keys. Pretty standard property management if you ask me. Just like with credit cards, most people dig themselves in to their own holes then blame  the company for providing a service. I like PPM and will continue to rent from them in the future. Beats the hell out of the slum lords who rent properties here while living in San Francisco.< /Text>

Absolutely terrible. Poor communication; we weren't in the area when looking for an apartment, and it'd take a week for them to email us back for 6 months. We would've moved a lot sooner if they had gotten back to us within a reasonable amount of time. And they lied to us. They said the gas was included in the rent, and there was no on site laundromat. The gas wasn't included, and there was a laundromat. And we only found out because the maintenence guy told us and we had to get a key to it from him! Worst service we've ever gotten in our lives. We only dealt with the them, because they were the only company with available apartments.<//Review>

First off, your 7-10 business days for approval/denial is a bold faced lie. You're more than prompt at taking your $42 processing fee. Your even fantasic on your very first reply, 'so looking forward to working with you'.
And after that, you may as well be talking to the wall! Your response time to phone calls/text/emails is non-existant. The fact that everyone who will be living in the house MUST text you which house you are interested in, is mental.
At one point, you had ever member of my family interested in differnt house, no matter how many times we tried to correct your information, it was wrong
So here we sit, over a month later,  with not a stitch of help from your company.
Oh, that's not true.  I lied.  You messaged my son this morning,  that YET AGAIN, the property we wanted is already spoken for.
Don't use this company.  You're better off doing your own footwork.
I do believe the positive reviews for this company are falsified.  It's probably employees trying to bury the truth.
And don't bother trying to find who I am,  PPM (as I've seen you do that before) My rental app was in with my whole family.  Which I'll be more than happy to provide you with,  should you need to verify that I was an actual customer.< /review></record></dataset><record>

So I'm in the process of looking for a new place to live in Humboldt and by just reading these reviews and seeing that the management is apologizing to every other reviewer just sets off a red flag. Sounds kinda Scammy. Also 42$ for an application wow. That's unheard of. #onlyinhumboldt< /Text>

The staff here was very kind, helpful, and fast. The restaurant had very good covid protections in place. It was very clean and socially distanced inside. They have a huge variety of sandwiches and the one I got was amazing. Great portions for the price, and great taste. Highly recommend The Sandwich Spot<//Text>

We stopped here during our roadtrip, after ordering online through Open Door we were notified our sandwiches wouldn't be ready for 30 minutes. We called in to double check how long it would take and after confirming 30 minutes we asked to cancel the order. The woman said she couldn't cancel it and we'd have to do it through Open Door. After spending time on Open Door and seeing no way to cancel it we decided to wait 20 more minutes. When I went in 30 minutes later the woman I spoke to over the phone said she didn't start making our sandwiches because she thought we were going to cancel which we clearly didn't so now we've had to wait nearly 45 min. Terrible customer service.<//text>

I have to say that I love Sandwich Spot. It's my favorite sandwich in Sacramento. But there is lack of consistency in the quality between the various restaurants. This one didn't have any Dutch Crunch. I had to settle for a Ciabatta roll and it didn't satisfy. It was very dry and smaller than a Dutch Crunch roll. With many options for sandwiches in town, quality is important.<//Review>

My dad and I ordered through GrubHub for lunch. They delivered my meal on time and with a smile.
The food however is what I'm reviewing.
I ordered a #2, add cream cheese. There was hardly any cream cheese that I paid extra for. There was also no bacon. The avacados were brown and mushy on my sandwich.
My Dad ordered a roast beef sandwich and enjoyed it even though they forgot the Mayo. He also ordered macaroni salad and got potato salad. He said it tasted fine, nothing special.
The bread I had, dutch crust, was fresh and soft.
Personally, I would not order from here again.<//review>

I was literally waiting for over 25 minutes for only 2 cheese sandwiches...2 cheese sandwiches. How hard can that be? But they kept telling me for  25 minutes "oh we're working on that right now" meanwhile they serve all these other customers all these complex sandwiches but can't get me my simple cheese sandwich. The sandwiches are over priced anyway just save the money and the time and go to Subway.<//review>

I'm already a huge fan of this place, but this location in particular is one of my favorites. Not only are the sandwiches super delicious, but the staff are always so friendly too. You can't beat it - great food, and great customer service.</review>

It's great that there is a Costco nearby so that I can take advantage of their famous $1.50 Hot Dog and drink. But after that I go straight to Choice Market where I buy just what I need and nothing more.<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Rude workers, the meat worker was pleasant. But the cashier's try to cheat you make sure you count your change and know prices before you pay. Only friendly to people that call them mama . Not a good choice to shop. Prices too high. Will not patronize this establishment any more.< /Text>< name>

Your typical neighborhood market formerly known as Hum's Market now Choice Market with a meat counter so you have your choice from ground beef, oxtails, bacon, chicken, turkey wings and etc. Many of the shoppers are local lottery players or neighbors that don't have easy access to a supermarket because Food 4 less is about a mile away. It's fast and convenient but expect to pay a convenience fee on certain grocery items. Service is ok and they can be friendly once they get to know you. Many people like myself come here to purchase lottery tickets. They are open every holiday but if it's slow they will close early. Don't forget just like any store to check the labels and expiration dates. FYI, They do NOT sell alcohol, beer, wine or spirits. Powerball winner sold here!<//text>

Kenny and Luis Syvania were amazing.  ...
They help me change my break light and change my windshield wiper blade. I visit the store on 08/31/2020
Best customer service experience ever. I truly recommend this facility to anyone that doesn't know about automobiles. I will definitely be back. Thank you,  Naren aka Diva 😉<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Very satisfied with the service they provided for us. We went in a bit ago to purchase a battery and the guy who helped us change it out really helped us out! It was late night and our battery was about to give our and had a long drive the next morning so we really appreciate him for helping us out unfortunately I can’t remember his name he was in his 20’s but his store number is #5715. Unfortunately while he was changing out our battery someone went in and stole a battery and I am very angry that the other older employee who was in the store at the time of the incident came out 5 minutes later and scolded at the employee who was helping us out at the time because he was outside helping us. In my personal opinion if he who was inside of the store at the time saw this happening he could had easily came out and brought it to our attention that this person was stealing and we could had helped to get the license plates number or something. I hope this guy doesn’t lose his job over a battery because he really did a big favor for us!! I will be calling the manager tomorrow to explain the situation in case of anything.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1603987261396, 'text': "Thank you for the review, Karla!

This people try to defruade me I went to get stuff that I need for my tune up. I almost got taking advantage of. I was going to purchase one of the deal that they have by the register. Which was 32 dollar's and changed this guys started charging me each part separate by the time he was done it was almost 90 dollars. What happened to the deal. Right. But anyway just be careful. Also they don't have any kind of professionalism to help.< /Review>

<review>A busy auto parts store. But the staff is always knowledgeable & helpful. Just be patient, it might take some time to be helped. I have been having problems with the "Optima" batteries that I purchased at this store. They have been good about replacing them. I would not buy another "Optima" battery, they are junk. Only getting about 10 months before they die. Then you can't get them to recharge. Buy the "Duralast" house brand battery, next time.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Rating>4</Rating><username>Loren Fisher< /username><UserId.>102328114098075666781<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I guess that maybe they dont like to have certain things that they used to in stock because everytime I go to get something that my vehicles need they seem to always say they dont have it but it could possibly be ordered and be picked up in 3to 4 business days for a fee. So I have kinda kept from getting anything there because I rather have the stuff to maintain my cars when the time is that I can do the job and finish between my work and family time.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>Don’t go to this Autozone if you are trying to price match. They don’t honor it. Went in trying to price match item had same warranty as they say it should “apples for apples” they say but was still denied. Went to the one in Oxnard Blv. Price matched no problem. Been to most autozones around me. So far all have priced matched except this location.<//review>< rating>

I came asking for a SPECIFIC power steering fluid for my car (since it's electric power steering) I asked if they had it and the guy said that the liquids are the same and tried to make me feel dumb because the specific one is more expensive. He said "well if you want to spend more money for the same thing then go ahead" completely unwarranted! I said nothing but "I'm looking for electric power steering fluid" and "I'm want to stick with the specific fluid". Maybe because I look very young but I KNOW what I'm talking about here.

I park it inside cause they don't have a bike rack outside. I've done it for ever. Today the jerk manager said to take it outside cause he did'nt want bikes in his store. Very rude guy. Took my business to Oreilly's 3/4 mile away.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80e84dc923154143:0xbc9ccb2fc23590c6<//Gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) Well, the only thing that when you go to charge your battery for your car does not tell you instantly that it does not work you have to wait for an hour or an hour and a half and in Oraily auto parts if it tells you how soon you take it to load it does not make you wait for there in more everything perfect ...

(Original)
Pues muy amables lo unico que cuando vas a cargar tu bateria para tu carro no te dicen al instante que no sirve tienes que esperar una hora u hora y media y en Oraily auto parts si te dice encuanto la llevas a cargar no te hace esperar de ahi en mas todo perfecto...< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I had a severe cycling road rash accident which took large chunks of skin off my arms, legs, and hip.I was going to be needing a specialist medical intervention to treat large section of lost skin (almost the size of my hands) from when I skidded 15 feet on the Pacific Coast Highway and clean out the asphalt, grime, and infections foreign matter lodged deep at the injury site. Dr. Suzuki really saved the day. The procedure took an hour to do all the site clean-outs, infected tissue removal, and he expertly sealed the road rashes. I was incredibly grateful for the pain management, his professional expertise, and a clear recovery roadmap (including wound hygiene and how to prevent my wound from contacting water when I showered) he reviewed in great details with me. He even sent a care package of bandage dressings to last me until the next 48 hrs for recovery. If it wasn't for Dr. Suzuki, my injuries are largely gone without scarring or requiring a skin graft. The wound clean-outs were textbook perfect and the wound sites never got infected or out of control.  He is the best. When you need a specialist, this is the reason why relying on the best to get the job done: bad injuries can alter your life forever and it takes a great doctor to get you back from the abyss.  He is the best. Hands down.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Dr. Suzuki and his team are awesome. I had an infected ingrown toe nail and  he was quickly able to accommodate me for a consultation and sort out the infection. He is a very personable Doctor who cares deeply for his patients. I have never had a Doctor who gave me a his personal cell phone and asked me to text him progress photos of the recovery to which he provided feedback. I have been to a lot of doctors and he is truly a great one.</Text>< Pictures>

Dr. Suzuki is truly excellent. His skill and experience as a wound care specialist are unmatched. He also cares deeply about his patients, and will go above and beyond to help them achieve the best possible outcomes. He is very careful to take into account the whole medical picture when treating his patients, which I've found to be a somewhat rare quality. Some specialists focus only on the wound or the body part of interest, and ignore the rest of the person! He clearly loves what he does, and that passion really shows.<//Text>

<Text>I’ve gone to Dr. Suzuki for the past three or so years as a part of my marathon training regimen. He’s extremely knowledgeable and every time I’ve had any issues he knew exactly how to remedy it. He has a very pleasant bedside manner which makes you very comfortable and at ease. Much like needing a great pair of shoes to run, having him as a part of my support crew is also crucial. It’s a bonus to have a doctor who not only has the academic knowledge, but first-hand knowledge of what we deal with throughout a grueling training season as he’s an avid athlete himself.< /Text>< pictures>

I had a excellent experience with Dr. Suzuki. He and his team were super friendly and helpful. Dr. Suzuki is also an accomplished athlete and it made my appointment so much easier because he was so relatable. He listened to my concerns and was able to get me back on my feet in no time. He’s an extremely qualified surgeon and was able to help me understand the extent of my injury. Amazing service. Highly recommend!< /Review>

Fantastic! He tended my 92 year old mom for the three months it took for her to heal her leg wound from an accident. She healed beautifully with zero complications. Suzuki was a delight as was his office staff. 100% recommend this super doctor.< /review>

I've been quietly dealing with reoccuring fungal infections on my feet for years now, and have been reluctant to seek medical treatment because I heard about negative side-effects with some oral anti-fungal medications. I usually used OTC sprays and creams that relieved the itching and scaling temporarily, but I recently had an episode so bad that I finally decided to visit a doctor. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Suzuki and his staff! He is very knowledgeable and easy to talk to, and his front desk is accommodating. Dr. Suzuki understood my concerns about taking certain medications, and prescribed me something doesn't have the bad side effects I've heard about. I'm happy with the results so far and am looking forward to my next followup appointment.<//Review>

< review>
As any martial artist or combat sports athlete/veteran will tell you, running is second to none when it comes to cardio and stamina. It is essential to any conditioning regimen and has been so for ages across all martial arts and combat sports. As with any other physical activity, running comes with its fair share of risk for injury.

That being said, I managed to mess up my right foot pretty bad in an attempt to ramp up my running routine too quickly. After doing some research and reaching out to a few podiatrists, I decided to visit Dr. Suzuki's clinic last week. After all, what better foot doctor could there be for a seasoned runner, or someone relatively new to it like myself, than a doctor that actively participates in marathons?

Truth be told, I was a little hesitant at first as I am still unemployed and working odd jobs to make ends meet as a result of the pandemic. However, having previously been a bartender for 20+ years I have a long history of not always taking the best care of my feet. Ultimately it was an investment in my health and continued growth as a martial artist so I was happy to pay for his expertise, insurance or not.

After running the gamut of standard questions and inquiries, (see what I did there?), Dr. Suzuki inspected my foot and explained that it appeared that I sprained the tendons and ligaments near the cuboid bone of my right foot. He explained the importance of proper footwear when running longer distances and instructed me to refrain from any conditioning oriented activities for a few weeks and to put my foot on ice daily.

Additionally, Dr. Suzuki suggested I look into his recommended "go to" shoes and socks as an avid runner, and gave me his email to "pick his brain" if I had any foot or running related questions in the future. He told me that I wouldn't be needing any shots or additonal treatment, and gave me a complimentary mask/sanitizer bundle for my girlfriend and I.

Then with a grin on his face, Dr. Suzuki proceeded to tell me to feel free to make another appointment with him in the future when/if I have a serious foot injury. He then sent me on my way free of charge! Words can't quite express the debt of gratitude I owe to Dr. Suzuki and his staff for their patience and kindness. It is beyond refreshing to find a doctor that is a true healer in a city where a fair amount of people are only in their respective fields for monetary gain.

Thank you Dr. Suzuki! 👊🙏❤< /review>

Amazing wound care!  I’ve had a deep gauge in my leg for 10 days and been to doctors and urgent care and on antibiotics the whole time.  But it was not getting better. Dr Suzuki and his staff are true professionals and are the experts for wounds.  He took care of of my wound surgically and painstakingly, without a blink. I feel so relieved.  Go to see him!  He’s the best!!!!!<//review>

When I called this doctor to refer a friend, his customer care was top notch and unparallel. The level of care he had for her was not only professional but treated her as if she were his family.  Highly recommended.< /text>

<text>I got a severe third degree burn from a dirt biking accident.  My original physician said I needed a skin graft, and my wound was not healing after 4 weeks.  I saw Dr. Suzuki for a second opinion who was able to clean out my wound properly and without removing skin from another part of my body.  I saw immediate results.  The wound started healing after seeing Dr. Suzuki.  He helped my wound heal without requiring a skin graft.</text>< Pictures>

I had a severe cycling road rash accident which took large chunks of skin off my arms, legs, and hip.I was going to be needing a specialist medical intervention to treat large section of lost skin (almost the size of my hands) from when I skidded 15 feet on the Pacific Coast Highway and clean out the asphalt, grime, and infections foreign matter lodged deep at the injury site. Dr. Suzuki really saved the day. The procedure took an hour to do all the site clean-outs, infected tissue removal, and he expertly sealed the road rashes. I was incredibly grateful for the pain management, his professional expertise, and a clear recovery roadmap (including wound hygiene and how to prevent my wound from contacting water when I showered) he reviewed in great details with me. He even sent a care package of bandage dressings to last me until the next 48 hrs for recovery. If it wasn't for Dr. Suzuki, my injuries are largely gone without scarring or requiring a skin graft. The wound clean-outs were textbook perfect and the wound sites never got infected or out of control.  He is the best. When you need a specialist, this is the reason why relying on the best to get the job done: bad injuries can alter your life forever and it takes a great doctor to get you back from the abyss.  He is the best. Hands down.<//Text>

<Text>Dr. Suzuki and his team are awesome. I had an infected ingrown toe nail and  he was quickly able to accommodate me for a consultation and sort out the infection. He is a very personable Doctor who cares deeply for his patients. I have never had a Doctor who gave me a his personal cell phone and asked me to text him progress photos of the recovery to which he provided feedback. I have been to a lot of doctors and he is truly a great one.</Text>< date>

Dr. Suzuki is truly excellent. His skill and experience as a wound care specialist are unmatched. He also cares deeply about his patients, and will go above and beyond to help them achieve the best possible outcomes. He is very careful to take into account the whole medical picture when treating his patients, which I've found to be a somewhat rare quality. Some specialists focus only on the wound or the body part of interest, and ignore the rest of the person! He clearly loves what he does, and that passion really shows.</text>

<Review>I’ve gone to Dr. Suzuki for the past three or so years as a part of my marathon training regimen. He’s extremely knowledgeable and every time I’ve had any issues he knew exactly how to remedy it. He has a very pleasant bedside manner which makes you very comfortable and at ease. Much like needing a great pair of shoes to run, having him as a part of my support crew is also crucial. It’s a bonus to have a doctor who not only has the academic knowledge, but first-hand knowledge of what we deal with throughout a grueling training season as he’s an avid athlete himself.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2b9320ee4ca47:0x6e6499b6e9803c81</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Dr Suzuki is one of the rare doctors who is not only expert in his field but genuinely cares about his patients. I totally recommend him and will always be grateful to the friend who recommended him.< /review>

As any martial artist or combat sports athlete/veteran will tell you, running is second to none when it comes to cardio and stamina. It is essential to any conditioning regimen and has been so for ages across all martial arts and combat sports. As with any other physical activity, running comes with its fair share of risk for injury.

That being said, I managed to mess up my right foot pretty bad in an attempt to ramp up my running routine too quickly. After doing some research and reaching out to a few podiatrists, I decided to visit Dr. Suzuki's clinic last week. After all, what better foot doctor could there be for a seasoned runner, or someone relatively new to it like myself, than a doctor that actively participates in marathons?

Truth be told, I was a little hesitant at first as I am still unemployed and working odd jobs to make ends meet as a result of the pandemic. However, having previously been a bartender for 20+ years I have a long history of not always taking the best care of my feet. Ultimately it was an investment in my health and continued growth as a martial artist so I was happy to pay for his expertise, insurance or not.

After running the gamut of standard questions and inquiries, (see what I did there?), Dr. Suzuki inspected my foot and explained that it appeared that I sprained the tendons and ligaments near the cuboid bone of my right foot. He explained the importance of proper footwear when running longer distances and instructed me to refrain from any conditioning oriented activities for a few weeks and to put my foot on ice daily.

Additionally, Dr. Suzuki suggested I look into his recommended "go to" shoes and socks as an avid runner, and gave me his email to "pick his brain" if I had any foot or running related questions in the future. He told me that I wouldn't be needing any shots or additonal treatment, and gave me a complimentary mask/sanitizer bundle for my girlfriend and I.

Then with a grin on his face, Dr. Suzuki proceeded to tell me to feel free to make another appointment with him in the future when/if I have a serious foot injury. He then sent me on my way free of charge! Words can't quite express the debt of gratitude I owe to Dr. Suzuki and his staff for their patience and kindness. It is beyond refreshing to find a doctor that is a true healer in a city where a fair amount of people are only in their respective fields for monetary gain.

Thank you Dr. Suzuki! 👊🙏❤</Review>

<review>Dr. Kazu is very easy to work with and is an expert in the field. He sets proper expectations regarding next steps and recovery - I always felt well informed. I would definitely recommend him to patients looking for superior wound care! And he is a Dodgers fan to boot :)<//review>< pics>

When I called this doctor to refer a friend, his customer care was top notch and unparallel. The level of care he had for her was not only professional but treated her as if she were his family.  Highly recommended.< /Review>

<text>I got a severe third degree burn from a dirt biking accident.  My original physician said I needed a skin graft, and my wound was not healing after 4 weeks.  I saw Dr. Suzuki for a second opinion who was able to clean out my wound properly and without removing skin from another part of my body.  I saw immediate results.  The wound started healing after seeing Dr. Suzuki.  He helped my wound heal without requiring a skin graft.</text><Rating>5<//Rating><Resp>{'time': 1535595706019, 'text': 'Thank you!!'}<//Resp><user_name>Karen Lum</user_name><GmapID>0x80c2b9320ee4ca47:0x6e6499b6e9803c81</GmapID><user_id>104924000906990214966< /user_id><Date>1535589051066</Date><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Dr Suzuki was recommended by Dr Harry Saperstein when a positive result for treatment to an infected wound was evading us.
Dr Saperstein sent the problem to the expert and the desired conclusion was realized forthwith.</review>

Best banh mi place in north county! Sometimes when you can’t drive 40 miles to Convoy area, you find new alternatives. I was very impressed with son tra’s sandwiches. I got the #1 combo and the thit nuong #10 which is grilled pork. The grilled pork is amazing, the meat is very tasty and has that char grill taste to it. The bread is nice and soft and doesn’t cut the roof of your mouth. Good eggrolls too. I want to try some of their vermicelli when I come here next time!</text>

<text>I've stopped by here a handful of times whenever I'm in north county. Every single time the food is SO good! Its a small hole in the wall spot next to a grocery store. The prices are some of the best around ($6.50+ tax came to $7 even as of the time of this posting) for a combo of any banh mi (I like the bbq pork) plus 2 egg rolls and a canned soda. They have other options as well that I will try later but their banh mi are out of this world. The bun is nice and toasted, the meat is seasoned to perfection and juicy, the carrots and daikon radish add great texture as well as a sweet and tangy contrast to the slight spicyness of the pork. Add on top of that some great service and this becomes my go to spot for a quick bite up in north cou nty!< /text>< Pics>

Support small businesses. Owners very hardworking! Good special. $6.50 will get you a sandwich, 2 egg rolls and a soda. Entrees are around 8 - 10 dollars and most sandwiches between 4.50 and 4.95. Delicious!!<//Review>

< review>
Fourth visit to this restaurant and each time has been excellent. Menu is limited compared to other Vietnamese places but the quality is very good, and frankly I worry about freshness with huge menus anyway. Family-oriented and very accommodating when I’ve asked for special changes to the menu items. The service is fast and friendly.  I pass by three other Pho places on the way here but this place is well worth the trip.< /review>

<Text>My husband and I had hiked Palomar Mountain most of the day so we were super hungry when we got here. We live in San Diego where the Vietnamese food is seriously lacking so I had low expectations coming into this place. I was born and raised in Saigon so I like to think my tastebuds know what Home tastes like. The little Vietnamese lady that worked the register and hustled in the kitchen was the sweetest. You order at the register, pay, and sit. It’s not a fancy restaurant, just your local Viet diner attached to a grocery store. They bring the food out to you and without asking, also bring you a tall glass of ice water. We all know about the stereotypical rushed, rude service at Asian joints. You will definitely not find that here. I just wanted to hug these people.

At first glance, one would think this spot specializes in banh mi. However, digging into the Yelp reviews I was surprised to see Bun Bo Hue and Bun Rieu mentioned often. My mom makes the best bun rieu so I never order it when I’m out. Except Momma is across the country in DC and I was desperate for some comfort food.
So I got the Bun Rieu and almost started crying on first bite. The broth was clean and simple, not extra greasy or salty but had the perfect flavor profile of pork, tomato, and seafood. They made sure all the toppings were there, the rieu (eggy minced pork concoction), congealed pork blood, fish cake (which by itself is another level of delicious), fried tofu, all the salad/mint/bean sprout fixings, AND the legit pungent fermented shrimp paste in a plastic container hidden next to the lemon slice. Trust me, mix some of this into the broth and that umami will hit you in the face. The portion is HUGE and unless you’re really hungry, you could probably split a bowl between two people.

We also ordered the banh cuon, chewy rice crepe with minced pork which traditionally comes with a side of pork cha lua, nem chua, steamed bean sprouts, and cucumber. Make sure you top this with the fish sauce that comes with it. The texture was chewier than I’m used to but I really enjoyed it.

Lastly, we ordered a chicken banh mi with all the fixings. I asked the lady to add pate which she happily obliged at no charge. The chicken was slightly dry but I did appreciate the large chunks of meat marinated in turmeric and lemongrass (traditionally it’s shredded and soy flavored). The baguette itself wasn’t all that great which was a bummer but we did come at a weird time (3:30pm on a Saturday).

In summary, support your local Mom and Pop! They are a sweet, honest business that deserve a chance. This is as authentic as it gets. The noodle soups taste just like home, or a stoop on an alley in Saigon. We saw a few locals eating in and most of them ordered the bun rieu or bun bo hue. They do have some traditional snacks, desserts, and finger foods pre-made next to the register. They do catering as well (based on all the pictures and signs in the place).< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Always a good idea to stop by for some delicious homemade Viet food! Even if it's just for a snack, Son Tra does everything right. Please support this local business as much as you can! And get the bun rieu or mi hoang for authentic Vietnamese cuisine that you can't find anywhere else!</Text>

<review>A great Latin/ Asian market. Much variety friendly staff. The new cashier does not know the stock yet. They do have several different types of mandarin pancakes for making moo shu in the freezer case on the left and behind the main door. 50 kinds of pasta.

Quite possibly the best Bahn-mi sandwich I've had in over a decade. The sandwich combo is an amazing deal. I was so incredibly happy when I stumbled upon this place. Never realized it was here and now it's probably my favorite lunch spot.<//Text>

<review>Great little Vietnamese sandwich shop.  Everything we ordered was well prepared and flavorful.  The staff was extremely pleasant and didn't seem to mind answering our silly questions.  I especially enjoyed the puff pastry with pork filling, so much that I bought all (3) they had left.  I will be going back to try their other offerings.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

food wasn't great.  We wanted to dine in, but they was closing in 30 minutes and pushed out me and my family.   They kept repeating we close in 30 min we close in 30 min.  I know you are closing in 30 min,  but I am customer and you are servicing me not me servicing you.  Most restaurants would be more than happy to have you sit and eat so they can get a nice tip.   We just so everyone knows this is the last time my family and I will never go there to eat again and don't believe the good reviews shown,  they seem like reviews from family.<//Review>

How this place doesn’t have a line out the door I have no idea..

The BEST bun I’ve ever had -kinda like a noodle buddah bowl of pickled veggies, mint cilantro noodles red cabbage and a sauce you pour over. AND THE BEST BBQ PORK EVER.

The bbq pork was perfectly seasoned - that kind of ‘I can’t stop eating this’ flavor. Not burnt or dry at all.

Wish I had 4 stomachs so I could eat everything on the menu at once and not die from gluttony.< /review>

This Vietnamese restaurant shares space with the Asian Market (La Sorpressa) and is worth a bite if you're doing a bit of grocery shopping.  The banh-mi sandwich was decent as was the vermicelli but the pho wasn't the greatest and had some really soft mooshy noodles that weren't really pho noodles at all.  This place would do in a pinch if there weren't at least 3 other pho joints within a 5 minute drive of this one that are better.  Adding a star because I just tried their fabulous meat pastry pies and steamed ground meat buns.  Really good.  Always get them with my to-go order of banh-mi.<//Text>

I got a new iPhone 11 Pro Max for my birthday/ Christmas but couldn’t activate it my cell.  I tried do it online and using my sprint app but was unsuccessful

I decided to go to a local store for help.  I came to the now T-Mobile (old Sprint) store.  They were very cool about signing me in outside (for social distancing).

They text me before I was up and finally was called up.  Miguel was the young man that helped me.  Miguel was very cool. He was sociable (wasn’t a robot).  Miguel was knowledgeable. He had a few hurdles in his way which he overcame.  He tried different devices and SIM cards and finally got it to work. He never game up.  Miguel is an asset to the store and I let the manager Juan know.  Juan was really cool too. He chatted a bit outside and did a good job of making sure his store was running well and we were all being social distance.

This was a great store. I wouldn’t hesitate to go again and if I ever need anything, I would be asking for Juan and is superb service!< /text>

I was foolish to arrive here because another Sprint store had told me that they would have the SIM card I needed for my pixel 2. The reason I feel this way is because the other store had given me unverified information to send me out because I wasn't purchasing a phone. My thanks for this location because even though they didn't have any in stock they had actually taken the time out of their busy day to look up local inventory to see if it can be found. As a result of their efforts, they had verified that they can not find the SIM in local stores and referred me to check out Sprint online or Best buy... Found it at Best buy for 10 bucks (vs 3 online).<//Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>No help of anything. I cannot receive texts; have been to 2 stores, talked to 2 technical support persons for at least 2 hours each time and problem not resolved. This store suggested to send my phone away to get it fixed at my expenses even though it's less than a year old (should still be under warranty) without a loaner phone, or buy a new phone. Another dumb thing is I can't log in to my account because I can't receive the text code; and no alternative such as voice call or email. Sprint signal coverage is not present at a lot of locations, even in urban areas. I will change to another carrier.</Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>Do Not Sign up with Sprint!!! The salespeople tell you one thing then when u get your bill it is another thing!!! It is always higher but even worse my bill averages $4-500 but I don't get statements and I can't reach a person to ever find out why. I have gone to the stores but they can't tell you.
I don't have my account number and can't cal to get it - you can't reach a human it just goes in circles. Can't log on with out an account number. They charge late fees when you are on auto bill pay but you can't ever reach anyone to ask why they did not process this. They tel you that you are buying a phone but after you pay for it they tell you it was leased. I could go on and on. Do not sign up<//Review><Date>1497230195228</Date>< GmapID>

Tech with no clue.  Online Tech Support could not believe what this Tech did to my phone I lost everything to fix a problem that was not fixed. Made me actually miss AT&T as a Carrier. If you have a problem with  Sprint whatever you do save yourself do not go to this store for help. Be afraid!</text>

Very unknowledgeable staff working here at this location
Be careful of staff just repeating incorrectly and just lies about sales and programs
If they tell you a price or specific details of a program or plan just ask them to confirm by showing you the details that they spout out
Be especially careful of  the asian guy named An V who really does not know details correctly of plans and programs offered by sprint
An V will tell you outright lies because he is careless about facts and prices<//review>

<Text>One of the worst experience ever at a phone company store. I went to ask simple questions about adding a phone line and the cost it would be, and one month later I receive a bill that is 150.00 dollars more than I pay. I went in to ask why I was being charged so much, and the lady that helped me that day said I had authorized her to change my plans when I had simply gone in that day asking mere questions. In addition to that her attitude was very stern and extremely unwelcoming, it made me feel very uncomfortable talking to her. She kept going on trying to prove her side of the story, of how I had authorized this change, when she should have been helping me solve her mistake. I extremely recommend you look for another phone company because Sprint provides horryfying customer service.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dcd93d1b653caf:0x79f461aac16474aa</gmapID></record>

When I arrived, I met her, she ask my name and I have to wait.
Later, a lady just walked in, she ask her how to help; then she fixed her cell right away. I saw 2 technicians at the counter.
Did she discrimination? Because I'm Asian?

Really bad experience it was supposed to be a simple return and drop off. Sprint over the phone said to take it here and they'll take it and fix this problem. Once there waited for like it seemed like forever then I finally get help and they said they can't take it that I need to call sprint and handle it with them. After talking in the phone with sprint she helped me out and told me that she was sorry that they need to be on the same page and that she was even writing them up for this big inconvenience. I walked out and told them thank you I was helped and that they were getting written up as well. The lady said they can return but if they don't want to they can't force them to. Horrible service and experience glad I left sprint.</review>

Worst experience ever. The manager should be fired. They trick you into buying their product and then refuse to help or take accountability if something goes wrong on their end. He even permitted his employees to hang up on customer calls. I called several times to get answers only to have them pick up and hang up.< /Review>

Bad service! Bad attitude! I came to this store yesterday to pay off my phone and bought a new one at 7:39pm. The lady raised the voice to me 3 times when I tried to make some questions. She showed the attitude that I am bothering her too much with my questions, just because I was the last customer and they need to close.... In general, Sprint locks me with their bad service. I will never use Sprint again after I am done with my contract!</review>

<review>A friend of mine recommended Tattoo Doctors, and suggested that I contact Cecelia as he'd seen examples of her work.  This was going to be my first custom tattoo (well, I have a tiny one on my stomach - so small it doesn't count - and I passed out during that) so I wanted to be sure I could get the best artist I could.  I wanted a floral design based on a watercolor by Charles Rennie Macintosh, and arranged a consultation with Cecelia.  She made a few recommendations as to size, design etc, and I signed up to get it done (at this point, she was booking about 6 weeks out).< /review>< pics>

<text>I was recommended here so I brought my friend cause she wanted a lip piercing...first off, very humble and radiant individuals working there. They're super attentive to your needs. The way they do piercings, man it's incredible...it's almost pain free and well done. Tattoos are a piece of work too. A most go! They're not called Tattoo Doctors just for show. Definitely check 'em out!!<//text>< time>

<text>Had to leave a review. I got yanked through my piercing because the guy didn’t ask for the service fee? And wanted get done? (“Better Charge the costumers you need to and give them good service”.) If someone cant pay they’ll leave. The guy with  tattoo on his face told me I need to wait because someone who came after me is spending $ 400 on tattoos so they get the service first? I understand it’s a business but seems like they only care about $ not costumer service.</text>< Pics>

This was by far the best tattoo experience I’ve had. I drove all the way from Virginia Beach , Va to come see Hollywood, and getting this tattoo made the experience so amazing! My tattoo artist was the absolute best! Couldn’t of asked for a better artist!< /Text>

The entire experience with Brilliance and Amanda specifically was great. Tattoo places can be intimidating but the staff is professional and welcoming. The tattoo looks great and exactly as I described.< /review>

<text>his review is for Krista. She helped me handle my tragus piercing that healed over, she was super nice and didn't do anything without telling me. She gave me expert advice and was very professional. If anyone was looking to get a piercing from this place I'd definitely recommend her! She is great!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Review>Jimmy The tattoo "Artist"  was completely distracted and off his ADHD meds. He kept talking with other tattoo artists that were standing around just killing time. Also looking away  watching Tv and did this for the entire news hour he kept on trying to make small talk about the news when all I wanted him to do was to focus his very "limited tattoo abilities"
Please see picture below.  GO TO ANOTHER SHOP THERE IS PLENTY OF OTHER SHOPS ON HOLLYWOOD BLVD.</Review>< gmap_id>

The little Homie Jonathan hooked mine up. His shift was over, but stayed to do it anyway. Really nice place, good service, good pricing. I'll roll with em again when I heal up.< /text>

<text>HORRIBLE TATTOO SHOP. Artist was rude and unprofessional. Talked about drugs and how tattooing was a chore. He wrapped my tattoo with a paper towel and tape at the end. I got home and my tattoo was bleeding. He used the same needle to shade my tattoo as he did to outline it. Will never go there again. And I HOPE TO SAVE SOMEONE ELSE FROM A BAD EXPERIENCE.! I would strongly recommend no one go to this shop. I wish I could post the pictures.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2bf23618969a7:0x3464dec2f70cd28b</gmapID>< response>

Got a tattoo from what seemed like a newer artist. He took a ridiculously long time just to get the stencil ready, then the tattoo didn't really come out the way it was in the picture I showed him. All in all, it definitely wasn't worth the money I spent.</Text>

I got my first tattoo there about 2 years ago. I wasn't sure about how it would turn out since it took 5 hours to complete. I also wasn't sure about the colors, if they would stay and just the quality of it all....I loved it and I still do. I had an awesome experience and very reasonable price as well. The female with colored hair did my tattoo and I loved it so much I have been searching for contact info since then and I am so glad I found it because I will be going back when I visit again. Does anyone know the female's name by the way, I would love for her to do other tattoos.< /review>

The people in the shop are friendly and welcoming, I went in to get a piercing done and it came out really nicely, he showed me all the stuff he was using was brand new(needle, clamp, gloves, jewelry) John told me what he was using, and he told about all the piercings they had done, and after it was all over him and I talked for 30 or 35 about how to clean it and take care of it and what to do if it gets infected and how to change the the jewelry. If I lived much closer I would get more piercings done there.</review>

<Text>Awesome. We were very unsure what kind of tattoo we we would get, how big, what font and.. just everything. This wonderful girl with blue hair was sooo patient with us, trouble customers :) She made our friendship tattoos quickly and it looks amazing. We are so happy! My second friend got inspired to get one too, which was no problem even tho it was late. We three got our tattoos and the tattooer was strict about getting everything clean before each one of us would get our tattoo. Very satisfied.< /Text><UserId.>112690708330811506322</UserId.>< resp>

<text>I have been coming here for the past 10 years. Last night got inked with a new artist (didn't get he's name) short skinny hispanic guy. The worst ever. This guy couldnt even get a straight line correctly. Now I'm stuck with a horrible tatto and I have to pay more to get it fixed. Will never go back to this place.< /text>< pictures>

It turned out like a dirty grey scar. The lines as well aren't straight. My friend also got the cross tattoo but she got it in black ink. Hers scared even more than mine did. right in the middle where the lines interests she has a crater type scar and the lines as well are uneven and it isn't even black its darker than mine but it is greyish as well. I would not recommend this place or at least the person we got which his name was John V. His license said he has been tattooing for 8 years but he did horrible.<//text>< rating>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>Love Grocery Outlet. You never know what you'll find. With that being the case, sometimes you can't get what you're specifically after; still a great place though going in knowing that. Cheap too!< /Review></record></dataset><record>
< Text>
Shop here 1st! Save yourself a lot of money. I first shop here to get all I can cheap, then get all the items I couldn't get here at a full priced store. I usually avoid perishables, but the meat is good, and the fruits and vegetables are great. I found being choosy on expiration dates is wise.</Text>

<Review>This place is usually pretty clean and the staff is usually kind. There is one manager at night who is off putting and somewhat rude to the other staff. Also they say they are open till nine but ask people to make their final purchases at 8:30. They do have a pretty good selection and the shelves are always full. As far as pricing goes they are pretty average for a grocery outlet.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Always a good deal, some products can be close to expiration so keep an eye out.
Nice staff, rarely gets too busy except of course the beginning of the month</Text>

I like Grocery Outlet they have pretty much most of the stuff that I need. They're less busy than other stores. They do rotate some of their products so it's not always the same thing every time. But I do like their produce.<//Review>

<Review>Midway market a very pleasant convenience store decently priced very good staff get you in and out as fast as they can so they don't drag you down if you're on 273 between Anderson and Redding I recommend if you want something to drink or snack that's the place you should stop.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x54d2c1566e696727:0x75352de9bd2f7772</Gmap_id><user_name>Mr. Flournoy</user_name><rating>5<//rating>< Pics>

< Review>
Lots to choose from but doesn't always have everything im looking for. I love having this kind of shopping near home. Its very convenient. Better than walking all the way through Walmart just for the few things needed. Ok i guess ill have coconut creamer instead of my normal coffee mate or silk almond lol!</Review>

<review>Worst experience because of Covid times we are watching every penny. Retired etc. so what a great deal we thought we would be for the two of us a turkey good brand etc. saw the deal for a turkey, $12 off if you spend over 30.00. So we buy our groc $80. Worth and we are told that turkey we have is not the one they said, but Jen 00 is the brand. They say oh if it’s a frozen one same brand same size not fromFrozen. No frozen  left. Very technical and uncaring - left without a Turkey<//review><username>Livvy T<//username>< Rating>

Great deals on some higher end products, but you have to pick and choose based on the expiration dates. Lots of stuff just about to expire here, some stuff already has. Not a good place to stock up as most of it has a very short shelf life. Hints the great deal.</Text>

<review>The stock rotates, so you can't rely on getting the same products from week to week, but there always some good deals to be had, so making a plan to stop in at least once per week is usually rewarding. The staff is friendly and comply with covid safety practices.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>There was a gentleman by the name of Lucas who deserves a 5 star rating.  There are not May young people that was as kind, polite, and helpful and a hard worker.

This is what brings me to the Anderson grocery outlet is because of him.

The lady in front of me spoke with his manager and just shook her head.  When an employee has a 5 star rating or just a good repor from the public to the manager they should acknowledge that and at least give the customer something to write a good review

Thank you Lucas for setting a great example for the employees to follow and always have such a good positive at work.

I hope this lands on his file so they really know what a good employee he truly is</review><Rate>5</Rate>< Pics>

<Text>New building is nice, but the prices increased when they moved.  If I am going to pay full price, might as well do all my shopping at one store.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Place is becoming a staple in the stores to shop at.  Pretty good selection and some unique items too. Sometimes the bagged produce isn’t the best but always a good value and selection for a smaller store.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>The only 2 times I've been there when I was next in line a relief checker came up and asked the people behind me to move to the checkstand she was opening. 2 different times, 2 different employees and neither of them thought to take the person who was truly next in line. Both times I had less than 4 items too where the customers they grabbed had full carts. Let's train your employees to not just grab the closest person but to look at the line and say to everyone "I can help the next person in line over on checkstand X". Or go around to the checker side and look and make eye contact to ask the person who was waiting the longest personally.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Easy to get to, great deals, clean bathrooms. A great place to stop for lunch off of I-5, especially if you’re looking for organic, gluten-free or vegan foods.<//Review>

I really like the daily emails I get every morning with their top deals of the day.  You can also enter into the drawing (monthly or weekly, not sure). To win a gift card for the amount you saved by shopping each time you shop there.< /text>

I'm going to give Grocery Outlet five stars all the way across because they always have some kind of good deal going they honor their Deals they give rain checks they have a decent produce section and the staff are always polite and one of the main things I really love about them is unlike Walmart they have mobility carts that actually work and are charged up for their elderly and disabled customers and that in itself is a major brownie point< /Text>

<Review>They constantly discriminate against ebt card holders. Watched them smash not only my groceries whilst being stingy what is supposed to be free bags, bags that are paper and aren't even supposed to have a charge, but also smashed all of the groceries belonging to a sensior citizen paying with ebt. WILL be filing a discrimination lawsuit as well hiring a PI to investigate their store.< /Review><date>1563323349636</date><UserId.>104510313173793412812< /UserId.><resp>None<//resp><pictures>None<//pictures><Gmap_id>0x54d2c1566e696727:0x75352de9bd2f7772< /Gmap_id>< name>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>Check out was bad, not many customers,  all lanes open, but cannot tell because Store too bright to see lane open light is on. Also, one lane as I try to get to it, cashier comes out in front of it and just starts jaw jacking with friends, like she had nothing to do. So I had to get in a line behind 3 others in a different lane, taking a good 5 minutes extra if my time. Then as she goes back to her register she glances and sees my two items are on the counter, so instead of asking me to come around to her register she goes and gets somebody else to check out. I only had 2 items, lady in front of me only 1, and our clerk was still checking out somebody else.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x54d2c1566e696727:0x75352de9bd2f7772< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>This store just opened in August, 2017.  It is a nice, clean store with discounted groceries and home items like cleaning and laundry supplies, beauty and over the counter medicine items, and fresh produce, meats, dairy and deli items.  They have new items every time I go in there.< /review>< Pictures>

This is a nice store although it is much smaller than I anticipated.  The prices I saw were somewhat comparable to Wal Mart or WinCo.  Some items a little cheaper and some higher.  For what I normally buy this is not the store I would go to.  When I checked out today it was about $18 and she told me I saved $28.  I don't know what they were comparing it too but it was ridiculous.  Even Safeway would not have cost me $28 more and they are the highest store in town.  My grandson and wife like this store very much as they are trying the vegan route and said this store has a lot of items they buy.  Sorry I can't say more good about this store but I am sure there will be a lot of people who are very pleased with it.  I will go there occasionally but it will not be a regular stop.< /review>

Used to shop here weekly until the cashier was so rude and the manager was even ruder! Have not been back for over 6 months! I go to redding or red bluff ! Very sad since they are so close! But won’t give my business to those who are disrespectful!!!< /Review>
