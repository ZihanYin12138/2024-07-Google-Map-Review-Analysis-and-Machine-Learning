Margo and Adam are delightful not only in design but also in how they welcomed us and explained how everything is made and are most kind! I'll be back soon for my dream sofa and more!

We searched for our new sofa a year ago. We had a specific idea about what we wanted and getting a customized sofa seemed far fetched, but we explored it anyway. We wandered into The Joneses LA and met Carrie. She helped us figure out that we could have exactly what we wanted and two weeks later we received our beautiful sofa. Great customer service and great sofa. One year later we needed a repair on the sofa and we received some of the best customer service we've ever gotten. Both Carrie and Noa were beyond awesome in getting us taken care of.<//Text>

Not only did Tina build a beautiful custom couch for us, but also she made us a custom bench that looks wonderful for our dining room. She took great measurements, helped us match woods and upholstery, and was keenly aware of the types of legs needed to support an extra long bench that we needed. Delivered on time with great care. Would highly recommend The Joneses LA Furniture if you're looking for furniture.<//Review>

Bought a fully custom made leather couch. It's comphy, beautiful and will last for a few decades. The staff was helpful in designing the piece and getting the right fill. Delivery was professional and efficient.< /Review>

That's how look "custom" made sofa just in two weeks of use.  I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy sofas from that friendly store. You chose something based on the floor sample but never know what you actually purchased. Lifetime warranty they offered on frame which impossible to break. Fabric quality is horrible. Preferable method of payment credit card at least you would protected by your credit card merchant. I will update you further. Loveseat pillow after one month<//Text>

I accidentally ran into this store and I'm glad I did because the merchandise and service is different. I was attended with dignity. No pressure as I freely walked around. Johnny who assisted was very humble and patient with me. It took awhile for me to settle on the right couch because of the beautiful selections. The price was very reasonable. I'm very happy and just can't stop talking about this place to my friends. I encourage anyone shopping for a piece of furniture to visit this store. You will be very happy you did.< /text>

Really a great experience! Prices were half of what I saw elsewhere, and the quality was even better than I expected. They have an amazing selection, with tons of catalogs showing even beyond what's on the site. David was super patient and never rushed our decision. When delivery. Came for my sectional and bedroom set, there were two deliver men working super fast to get everything done! Will definitely be back<//Text>

The service provided by this store is top notch. I found a lovely comfortable sleeper-couch here which was very affordable. Victor is a wonderful person to deal with, in fact everyone in the shop is nice and helpful. The customer is #1 here without a doubt. My studio apartment is full now but if I ever need furniture in the future I will look here first.< /review>

We look forward to seeing you again at The Joneses.\n☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️❤️'}<//resp><Review>We stopped in one day to look for a new couch and met Josh, who walked around the store explaining all the couches we were interested in. We picked one out but wanted to shop around to be sure it was the one. We went back and forth, stopped in several times, and asked tons of questions. Josh was always extremely helpful and patient as well as really knowledgeable about the couches and fabrics. We had a minor miscommunication about something and they were quick to correct it and take care of us without any issues. They genuinely care about their customers happiness with the product they make. Our couch is beautiful.  We looked at so many places and none of them were close to the product here. That along with the customer service made our experience here absolutely wonderful. Everyone we met while making our decision was helpful, patient and engaging.  We are officially customers for life. If I need another couch I won't be going anywhere else.
Oh, and the turn around time from when the couch was ordered is 2 weeks or so, unlike the 8-10 weeks we were hearing at other places 😱.<//Review>< Date>

Love The Joneses! I'd been looking for a sofa for awhile and found one there in 5 minutes. The owners are so nice and friendly. They were extremely helpful when I had follow up questions. There was a small issue with the cushions and they fixed it in a day. So happy I found them and will be back there soon.< /Review>

The turn around time is not 8-10 weeks (restoration hardware) which is amazing as well. Seriously just buy all of your furniture you ever need from here because not only are they awesome and the quality is astonishing, their products have great range in design and it looks...Just perfect.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c2b9309d375c5d:0x64fbbeb03b0f496f<//gmap_id><user_name>Antonio Aaron< /user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

This place is amazing!  We looked at Ashley and other furniture stores but everything looked and felt so cheap.  The Joneses has very high quality furniture and Margot (the owner) gave us an exceptional deal.  The variety and designs are so cool.  I highly recommend stopping by and checking it out!!<//Review>

We loved the experience of buying our sectional from The Joneses, and were thrilled with the finished product.   The showroom is laid back and offers lots of selection.  Margot and Johnny both helped with ideas about color, style, size.  Most importantly, they helped us figure out exactly what we wanted and needed.  Then they were able to make the sectional to our  specifications at a completely reasonable price.   So the sectional fits our space perfectly, the fabric combines midcentury vibe with a great match to our color scheme, we were able to combine functionality, comfort and design in EXACTLY the balance we want.   We couldn't be happier.</Text>

< review>
I’ve been shopping a while so there is a little burn out factor her but.. the staff was pleasant enough but I felt their designs were limited in a transitional/ modern style that did not suit me. The quality looked to be average. I guess if I was loooking for a generic style this would have made 3 - 4 stars.<//review>

<review>This is hands down the best store in LA. The selection, options and attitude made my sofa designing/ordering process simple and actually fun. I did my due diligence and shopped around-no other store compared in service and options at affordable prices. I received my sofa in two weeks and it's everything I wanted.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1551272454646, 'text': 'Thank you Andrew!\n☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️'}</Resp>< gmap_id>

Very friendly staff, good music.  And the fish is off the chain, so good, it came with home made sauce, I asked for tartar sauce and the young lady said" it's real good sauce" but I still asked for the tartar sauce,  well let me tell you, the tartar sauce is still in the cup, that sauce with the fish Omg.  The music was spot on, just a relaxed afternoon at the Solid Rock Cafe.  Thanks< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I loved the Gospel music. Other than that very disappointed being since I’m  familiar with the owner. I got there at noon did not get my food til 1 and I’m the only customer in there no one said sorry for the delay or thanked me for my patience. I get half my order chicken and waffles the only thing hot was my waffles. I ask for a to go container received it with a smile. I ask what happen to the grits I ordered she tells me oh I forgot do you want them to go. I was so frustrated and upset. Prices are reasonable but service not good. I wish the owner was there my experience may have been better and my food would have been seasoned  and hot.<//review>< pictures>

This was my first time and last time going here. If I could give 0 stars I would. My family said it was good food. It took a long time to get our food. It's like they forgot we order anything.  It seems like the only chicken breast they have is on a wrap. All the other chicken is thighs and drumsticks. So I decided to go with a cheeseburger buger. The price for the cheeseburger is $8.95 and to add fries it's $10.95. For that price I thinking it's going to be some nice delicious nice burger and good portion of fries. Total disappointment. First off the burger was warm. there wasn't much fries. And to top it off. It was a frozen hamburger put on a small size bun. So basically the Pattie was bigger than the bun it's self. There was no onions that was to come with it and little pieces of lettuce. While my family got to eat their food. I had to wait for another burger. I came hungry, and what to leave hungry. I asked for onions, since they forgot it last time. I was asked grilled or reg. Big mistake. This time it's came with grilled  onion's that was over pilled and spilling off the burger, and so greasy. It made the whole buger greasy. It seams like there was no seasoning on the burger.  So I had to eat something I really didn't want to. Why charge that much for a frozen hamburger. I thought it would be homemade cheeseburger with a price like that. I was better off going to a fast food place. I would save some money and least know I am getting my money worth.</review>

Went here after the wine walk with mom and sis. Ordered the catfish and it was DELICIOUS,  cooked just right and the breading was perfect.  I also ordered the collard greens which were really good. It's awesome that they let me substitute brown rice instead of white rice. After our meal we split an order of beignets & OMG if your here you gotta try the beignets. The atmosphere was nice and the service was great.  Going to come back soon.</review>

<Text>Excellent atmosphere , in a Christian environment . Well trained staff excellent home cooked meals , Gumbo , Turkey Wings , Seafood , Hamburgers,  appetizers their is catering available  . Upstairs and downstairs seating , room for 100 . The restaurant owners the Smith Family are frequently in attendance , a enjoyable experience  . The Solid Rock Cafe also has room for special events , a stage and other amenities  .  In my last visit I noticed a balcony overlooking the Antioch Delta , in the late Spring and Summer months wil be a relaxing hopefully opening for outside dining . Overall , great for running in for a home cooked meal or just sitting in watching a sporting event with appetizers, or a date night  you won't be disappointed !< /Text>< name>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>They were very pricey, plus we had 2 buckets of chicken and they handed it out the window and it didn't quite fit in Our car window and it almost fell and they looked at Us like We committed a crime! We are in Our 80's and it's hard for Us to grab 2-16pc chicken buckets into a 🚗car window!!
We spent over $100.00 there and they could have been more helpful. I don't think we'll be going back to KFC in Manteca!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Cluckin horrible. Took 20 minutes to get my food in drive thru. Over heard her tell car in front of me they're outta fries. Then I get to window and they wait another 5 minutes to tell me the same thing. Ordered Nashville strips, they had it to me in a bag and container is open. Now I got that sauce all over my seats. Colonel can go cluck himself.< /text>

Went to drive thru tonight to order a bucket of Chicken only.. Online, it states a 14 pc is $21.99.. When they told us price after ordering, it was $36.**.. When asked about why so high, they stated they don't do online prices.. Then why are you advertising online.. Needless to say, we didn't order and will never go back< /text>

<review>16 pc chicken, two fries, biscuits, and coleslaw as $30 fill up, $32 after tax. Good deal.
I don't eat here often, and I always forget how much smaller the pieces are now, compared to when I was a kid.<//review></record></dataset><record>

When I got the kfc wings and the chicken sandwich with fries. The wings were very small and had very little sustenance. The fries only filled half the cup. The chicken sandwich was good but it was supposed to be honey barbecue dipped, yet they only added the sauce on top.<//review>

Alex blood you are raw. Even when the tenders are out he made sure we were satisfied with our purchase. Will come back to constantly because of Alex attitude and attention to detail, customer service.<//Review>

I ordered 2 family meals. One was almost all wings, 5/8 were wings, so I called and they offered a replacement. I offered to bring in the messed up order, but they said the receipt would suffice. Upon arrival,  they asked if the original order was crispy or original. It was original. They tried to argue. They accused me of lying. This is why I had originally offered to bring the messed up order.

It's not the customers fault that you messed up. I won't be coming back to this location.<//text>

Really enjoyed the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and regular chicken sandwich in Manteca. Plus no line at all at the drive-through at 1:30 on a Tuesday afternoon.</review>

Great experience. I haven't been to a KFC for a very long time and it was a good family time. The young man taking our order was very helpful, willing to go above and beyond for what we wanted. The place was clean, quiet, not too busy for a Thursday night. Food was good, all the sides were hot, just 1 piece of extra crispy chicken was under done. Enjoyable time.< /text>

It is just not as good as it use to be. The service was excellent but the chicken looked like it was from a small chicken. It's just not my go to place any more. I keep giving it another chance but no improvement<//review>

Just bought a 16 piece meal and went home found out that they put only  12 pieces.  Do I have to count the pieces every time I order from this store before I leave? Are they Intentionally shortchanging the order or these people needs to go back to basic counting or math?< /Text>

<review>Friendly employees and remodeling is nice inside and out.  Its a shame that the food containers have been revamped also because the portions seem alot smaller. The 8 piece meal bucket is so small that the chicken was stuffed into the bucket so it was squished in order to get the lid on. The only container that was original out of my order was the 4 biscuit box. I walked out spending over $40 for an 8 piece 4 family meal with an xtra side of mashed potatoes. Seems very pricey for the amount received. I will not be going back for a long time unless somebody else is paying for the meal. 😞<//review>< Rating>

KFC use to be a good value.  It just isn't anymore.  It doesn't offer chicken and biscuit only options or single piece options anymore.  There are many things over the years that have just finally made it to the point I just get chicken at the grocery store hot counter now unless someone requests Kentucky Fried Chicken.  It seems when they shortened the name to its initials KFC they also shortened what the name itself stood for.< /review>

It was the worst service that I've ever had. I was offered a cake and then told they didn't have any. I was informed that if I wanted potato wedges I would have to wait 5 minutes. Because I was in a hurry I just got xtra mashed potatoes. Well, while I was waiting for my order to be completed I noticed that my popcorn chicken wasn't even cooked. So why did they not tell me? Also my food was sitting on the counter getting cold. Manager really didn't even care. Not even a I'm sorry. So after 15 minutes later I got cold chicken, warm popcorn chicken, hot wedges and 12 cookies. See ya much later KFC.< /review>

Manteca's KFC blows Turlock's out of the damn water. At least their chicken isn't dry, hard, and they actually have foods available instead of telling you they're perpetually out of many things lol</text>

My friend was very persistent and a bit aggressive, the employees did try there best but looked more scared than anything else. I give 3 stars due to the limited food available versus the time you close. Closure should not be a factor when you are open for at least 2 more hours.<//review>

Seems like this restaurant is constantly forgetting something in my order. The chicken is good but you're better off dining in. That way you can make sure you get all that you pay for.</Review>

I was standing in line and looking at the menu, and I said to my hubby, I wish they had a wing meal. I get up to the register and there is a sign managers special 4 wings 2 sides and a drink for 5.99, score!! They also remembered to give us the butter and the honey for the biscuit. No other KFC I go to does this!!! Great service.< /text>

I don't get by this place often but each time they have been very fast and very efficient. Today I was there I wanted their $5 special and the person taking my order said there is a special just for today and it's cheaper. I'm in!< /Text>

Have come here many times, and they just make a lot of mistakes. Usually when you eat  at the location, the meal is well prepared and good. However, EVERYTIME we get it to go, or through drive through, they miss something. Last time I ate here they missed an entire box and sandwich from my order, plus a side. I had to drive all the way back to the location because half the family didnt get their meal.<//text>

Went Saturday night. Will never go again. Food was disgusting, and burned. Nothing was edible, we threw it in the garbage ($42) Called next day to speak with the owner Matt. After I explained what happened and how frustrating it was, his comment was...ok<//Review>

KFC is forever getting my order wrong,  overcooking something, or simply wait umtil i have paid to tell me somethimg is going to be a long wait because they dont have ot ready. etc. Such a bummer because I love KFC and neither one close to me have very good service.<//Text>

<text>They don't want to work even its 9pm still 1 hr to go but evening staff is too lazy to do their job. I ask for a $5fill up #5 but they are out of it and when I ask to make it with other option she try to charge me a two peice meal for almost 8 bucks. Hell no why should I pay extra for you guys fault? It was still more then 50 mins to close but she denied to cook some more chiken. Seriously!!??</text><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

<review>Got a Haircut here about a week back. A little late for a review but lets pop this off.

Ive been coming here for about 2 years now and honestly its one of the most comfortable haircuts you could get. The staff are super friendly, always asking what I want or if I want the same cut as last time. They don’t disappoint. I always go with the VIP treatment, coMes off to about $27, BUT its worth it. Would definitely recommend to anyone. But it is specifically for men.</review>< GmapID>

Everytime we come here they do a really great job! We've had a couple different stylists and each cut has been very well done and professional.</review>

As always friendly staff. Check-in through the app went smoothly.
Not that cleanliness was ever an issue here but the facility takes as much precautions as I'd imagine reasonable and safe with cleaning and sanitizing.<//Review>

Poorly Staffed on a Saturday.   Waited a hour and a half just to leave, due to incredibly slow service.  The Manager needs to staff accordingly.  The Pricing signs were all missing as well.  I feel like I was better off going to a shop that has independent contractors.<//review>

I've never been really thrilled with my haircut here, but I've never been hugely disappointed either. Their saving grace is they usually get you seated in a reasonable amount of time. Price is kinda high.< /Review>

Generally a great experience as far as getting my hair cut.  Never seems to be enough people cutting hair though.  Commonly wait for over 45 min and as long as just under two hours.  Unless you have an appointment you can expect to be ignored unless you happen to be the only person in the lobby waiting.   Would be nice if they actually staffed enough people to handle peak hours.<//review>

<review>I've been here a few times and there has only been a handful of times that I've actually walked out with a great looking haircut.  Their stylists never seem to know what a medium or low fade is, so I end up with an extremely high fade and a disappointing haircut.  For the price of an $18 haircut, I can get two better looking haircuts somewhere else in Oxnard.  I did enjoy the steam towel and massage, but it's not worth the extra $6 since you end up paying $24 plus tip for a mediocre haircut.  The location is clean and has a great decor, though, so if you do decide to come here, I suggest you ask for Jean since she was the only one that would give me a good looking haircut.<//review><date>1457655622357<//date>< response>

<Text>Only place I've gotten my haircut in the last 5 years. It's getting a little pricey, but the service is usually pretty good and you get to watch sports while you get your hair cut.</Text>< Rating>

<Review>My safe-haven, for reals 😉 wondering why? Simply because they make you look good, a venting-out place-to-be (my perks as regulars) coz they will just listen to you and sometimes will give you advice back when solicited, very respectful friendly hangout place, indeed 🤗😉✌👌< /Review>< pics>

First off, I have been a customer of Sports clips off and on for over five years but today was the last straw.

I was seated at 11:20 and I was walking out of the shop at 11:32!!! I told  Margarita how I wanted my haircut. She immediately started cutting my hair wayyyyy too fast. I told her I wanted a medium fade, skin on the sides and a comb over on top.

She didn't cut the sides short enough and she cut wayyyyy too much off the top. So much that I can't even 'comb it over'.

I paid for a tripple play, because I like the steam towel and my hair washed. She spent literally 2 minutes washing my hair and with the steam towel on.

She went way too fast and the tripple play experience was not the usual experience.

Bad haircut, Margarita was in a hurry and didn't provide good customer service at all. She didn't even talk... YOUR CUSTOMER OF FIVE YEARS WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK.

If you are in the Military, you're better off getting a hair cut at the exchange and we all know how bad those cuts are.

If you want a great haircut I HIGHLY recommend "Tomahawk barbershop" in Ventura those guys will take care of you. There's a reason they have a 5 star review and Sports clips doesn't even have a 4.

Nobody does a quality haircut and wash in 12 minutes.... There's absolutely no reason why an employee should be rushing the customers out the door.<//Review>

Long wait times and you will not be greeted upon arrival . The staff seems unhappy which is not a great environment for kids . Decor is nice also nice that the football game was on . Haircuts are okay not what you would expect from a barber . I will not be bringing my kids back .</Review>

Worst place I've been to. Unprofessional, not a single greet upon arrival, waited for 40 minutes until I decide to leave. It seems that you have to call ahead to get service. If you walk in you might get lucky and get service. This place is understaffed. You are better else somewhere else where you don't have to wait so long for service and probably a lot cheaper.</Review>

<Review>It seems that they are always understaffed. Great location but wait times are more than frustrating. Can't they at least fully staff the seats on busy peak times. The owner needs to make sure the staffing is right. I have heard an seen customers just walk out and leave or voice why the wait times so long. Myself included</Review>< Rating>

<text>I have been going to this place for the last 10 years. Lately the sistem they have with the app, shows long waits to be on deck and when you get to the shop the times are way less. It could be a problem if clients get discouraged by the waiting times on the app.</text>< Name>

<Review>My sisters, mom, and I love coming here to get our eyebrows and upper lip threaded! Nikkie is very kind, professional, and does a great job at cleaning and shaping your eyebrows. Even though her salon is closed, she has her own salon inside her house which is very clean. We’ve been coming to her for almost a year and we always leave happy.</Review><name>Noreen Naqvi< /name>< user>

Niki is amazing! She did my highlights and was so patient with me for choosing the color. I went back and forth with my shade but she was super flexible and did a super great job! I also did my eyebrows and is perfect! Kudos!!<//Review>

< Review>
For a guy, it’s hard for me to find someone that can cut/style my hair properly.

Mark cuts and styles great hair! My go-to person for years. He takes the time to make sure you walk out looking great.

He worked with me to get my hair to the way I want it to be and also recommended the right product to help keep my hair looking good.

He also works with my schedule, and goes beyond to get me on the chair for a cut.</Review>

<review>My husband & I love coming here for great facials & eyebrow threadings. Nikki provides great customer service every time. We have been coming here for about a year now & we keep recommending this place to our friends & family.

I’ve had facials at other places but this is the best so far. Eyebrow threading always consistent. Very reasonable prices & good quality.</review>< Pics>

My name is Michelle and this is my second time coming here and my experience has been great! Nikki is very nice and she knows what she is doing! She takes her time and doesn’t rush, like other places I’ve been before. The place that I went before coming here messed up my brows and Nikki fixes them for me! I will be a regular customer from now on and recommend this place to others!<//Review>

This is the absolute best eyebrow threading store in the business. The women that work there are so amazing and nice. They treat my family and I with well service/ pricing. I used to get my eyebrows done at the mall but this place of business is way more better. You should definitely go there. ❤️< /Text>

<Review>So how do i explain this. from the start, it was bad. she botched my brow the very first time i went. made them too thin and one was thinner than the other and my brows didnt even line up with each other lol. service was so bad. i had to wait 30 mins one time to get them done and one time she stopped someones facial to touch my face to do my brows. very unsanitary. i do not recommend this place for future clients.<//Review>< user>

<review>Beyond expectations.. The girls are awesome. I love this place because of their work as well as their friendly behavior. I can never go anywhere for threading, hair do's and facial massage. What I can say it’s a complete package 😍.< /review>< Pictures>

Very nice service! It was my first time threading my eyebrows, so I was a bit nervous and scared of the pain. However, the threading process was very fast and wasn't as painful as I expected! I love how my eyebrows turned out and would come back again! :) I highly recommend this place! Also, eyebrow threading is only $6!</Text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>I came here once, and thought they did an awesome job for the price! Unfortunately, their hours are not accurate and non-consistent. I tried going in for a second time on a Tuesday at 10am, but they had a sign saying are closed for three days. Today I looked online and saw that they should be open. Again, when I went, they were closed. Apparently they are closed on Sundays and Mondays. SO do not go on Sundays and Mondays and call to make sure they are in before going.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Text>I've been to alot of threading salon in town and in L.A. but this place is abosolutely the best and Nikki always does an amazing job and customer service. She is so friendly and has the softest hand ever! Whenever she does my eyebrows, I never feel any pain unlike in other places. I'm glad we moved in Clovis area and tried out this place. You guys should too! Plus, it's only for $6.<//Text>< Pics>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>She really messed my eyebrows up.I  was growing them out thick and 1st time coming to her she tore them up super missed match AND  thin. She completely took off the whole edge of my right eyebrow.  Its probably because she messed them up filled them in and continued to thread them. I dont know if she messed them up and filled them in so i dont noticed or because she filled and thread them. Took me so long to get them full. HORRIFIC 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 at least she could have told me she messed up instead of trying cover it up.< /Review><username>Cristina Cardenas< /username><pics>None< /pics><Rating>1<//Rating><GmapID>0x80945c668bd73379:0xedfcc40ee3d9708< /GmapID></record>

This place is the best business place for  threading eyebrows. I been to other two eyebrows places in Fresno but the first one couldn't do my eyebrows, the second, price is too high like $11. I thought about going to Visalia but I decided to try this place and I like it!
I recommend this place because of the price and customer service.</Text>

I tried a few vets when I first got my dog and none were honest and just wanted to do things that were not necessary to get more income..
But when I tried SF Pet Hospital and met Dr. Leyba he was fair , reasonable and cared about addressing the issues that my dog had without inflating the visit cost. And the staff are very helpful and friendly too!</Text>

That was my only criteria in choosing the vet, but I'm so glad it ended up being this place. My primary vet has been Dr. Leyba. When I first met him, I was amazed at how much time he spent talking to me not only about my puppy's health, but also about puppy raising in general and my anxieties and stressors with this all being new to me. Not only was the doctor amazing, but every staff member I have encountered at SF pet hospital has been warm, open, kind, and attentive to my dog's needs. My dog actually enjoys going to the vet and gets excited when he sees the staff that come out to get him (and give him treats). My puppy has been having a lot of stomach issues, so in his short life so far, I have talked to the vet quite frequently. They are always available by call or email and have a really quick response time. No question is deemed "stupid" by them, even when my dad was convinced that my dog had pooped out a living slug and had me send a picture to the vet asking what could be wrong with him for him to poop out a slug (which is not possible), they kindly explained in detail how it is not possible and reassured me my dog is fine. I tell everyone I encounter what a great vet I have, and I am so thankful to have come across Sf Pet Hospital. Thank you to everyone there! Desmond and I appreciate you!< /Text>< Name>

< Review>
I have been using this hospital for more than 20 years and have always had good experiences.  Recently my most beloved cat of 9 years went from being okay to unresponsive in one night. The next day I took him to emergency.  They could not figure out what was wrong, but they kept him alive. The next day I brought him to this pet Hospital. Dr. Hunter was the one to provide him with care.  She was able to figure out what was wrong,  give him a working diagnosis and treat him.  He is back from the dead but not fully recovered. We are hoping he keeps getting better.
Dr. Hunter basically saves his life. Thank you!< /Review>

My dog Titus got surgery there a couple of weeks ago now. He had a growth removed from his mouth and they needed to send it into a lab to see if it was cancerous. They told me that it didn't look good when it was taken out and that there is a chance that it could be worse than we thought. They told me results from lab would be back in 5 days. It has been over two weeks since his surgery I have called them multiple times and they even told me three days ago that they have the results in but the Dr. wasn't in to give them to me over the phone. I asked them when I would need to get the stitches taken out, and they said 14 days. I told them that it has been 14 days... (shouldn't they know that and call me?) He got his stitches removed today and no sign of the Dr. and no results from the surgery still!!!

Terrible service, very unprofessional, and extremely expensive. Do not take your pet here for any serious problems that involve surgery. They will make you feel like your pet is in terrible health and then never call you with the results. Over $2k for a simple growth removal surgery with no results.</Text>

<Review>SF Pet Hospital is the best vet in the city for sure. We've been taking our pup there for 6+ years and last year we decided to try a new vet that was much closer to our home. Big mistake. They didn't come close to the level of care, attention to detail, and thoughtfulness. We're SF Pet Hospital lifers now. <3</Review>< Rating>

The SF Pet Hospital team is amazing. We rescued our sweet pup, so this was our first time bringing her in. Dr. Hunter took to time to (patiently) answer my long list of questions. When I had billing questions, Jeannie, was there to help and was so great to talk to. I am grateful for this team and am so excited to have found a reliable, down to earth team to help care for our sweet gal!< /Review>

< Review>
I can't recommend this place enough! My kitten got great care, and as her owner I really felt the vet listened and responded very thoughtfully to all of my concerns for her health, which put a lot of my anxiety as a new cat-mom at ease.

They even helped me get an earlier apt after I explained her condition to the doc. They put me on a cancellation list and I was called within the hour for an apt weeks earlier! I feel I got very lucky, but it also speaks to the level of care and commitment they have for animals.< /Review>

<Review>We went to the SF Pet Hospital for over 20 years. We took our older dog Gracie to be seen because she had been experiencing some arthritis in her hips which was being treated after being seen at the SFSPCA (when we called the the Pet Hospital to see her they told us to go somewhere else, they would not fit her in). After I had called her Pet Hospital vet a couple of times to check the meds, Dr. Leyba  got back to me.  We decided to follow up at the Pet Hospital and Dr. Hunter found a mast cell tumor on her side (which I had been concerned about).  She did the surgery on Gracie the following week and left on vacation.  Dr. Hunter has never followed up with us nor checked in on Gracie again.  Ever.

Gracie came home after the surgery that Thursday mildly sedated and given Buprenorphine (an opiate) to be given 2-3x/ day.  My girl never recovered.  I called on the Friday telling the tech (because the vet never returned my call) about her troubles.  She was sedated, not herself.  And the tech told me that I needed to give her Benadryl and an acid regulator.  I called back on Saturday morning, a tech told me Gracie, who paced all night, who was no longer walking, nor eating or  drinking, was "fine."  She never even suggested seeing her.  Again, no vet ever called nor responded.  I called again in the afternoon as Gracie had grown despondent, cold, drooling more and more.  The same tech said Gracie was "milking it" because she was an older dog and that bringing her in would be "too stressful." Gracie died in our home with our children a couple hours later.  The death in our home was horribly traumatic for all of us.  The Pet Hospital, Dr. Leyba and Dr. Hunter and the staff never called to check on Gracie.  After her death, I called and spoke to Dr. Leyba about the mismanagement of her case. The Pet Hospital never called, sent a card nor did anything to show any contrition for mismanaging her case (in my opinion).  We used this hospital for 20 years and I believe they were negligent about Gracie and cursory to us as long term clients.  I would beware.< /Review><Date>1600289509505<//Date></record>

I can't say enough good things about SF Pet Hospital. The front desk staff is so responsive, patient, and warm. The vets are caring and professional. I love bringing our dog to a place where I trust that the caregivers are knowledgeable and love animals.< /Text>

<Text>Lee and the entire staff have cared for my cats and now Wilbur for over 30 years! I am incredibly grateful for the great care my pets have gotten. I seriously have a long list of the way you have made a difference in the quality of our pet's lives that wouldn't fit in this space. Our family gets so much joy from having and loving our pets. Your staff has helped to make that possible. So to answer your question, veterinary care just doesn't get better than this! Thank you so much for all you have done.

Six years ago, we noticed lumps on my malamute. After our current vet said they were only "old dog lumps" we opted for a second opinion with SF Pet Hospital. Dr. Hunter took the time to listen to our concerns and did a thorough exam to discover that two of the lumps were cancerous, one being a large MCT. After surgery the next day and lots of love and care from Dr. Hunter and the entire staff, I am happy to say I have a 13-year old who is still a healthy and happy fur baby. I have never experienced a vet who loves my dog more than Dr. Hunter loves Kaiyuh. And Kaiyuh knows it too. She is happy and willing to walk into that office any time she needs a check up - a very rare occurrence, as any pet owner knows, for a dog at the sight of the "dreaded vet's office". I could not recommend Dr. Hunter or SF Pet Hospital more. We love that team!<//text>

Years ago my dog was extremely ill, and needed an emergency blood transfusion.  The vet called me and let me know-- but that blood would take a few days to get here, which would be too late to save his life.  She said that she had called the dog walker to bring her OWN dog over, so that we could use it's blood that very same day.  I am so impressed with the sincere level of care SF Pet Hospital provides.  Thankfully my dog survived, and we continue to rely on SF Pet Hospital for regular check-ups  and vaccines, for both my dog and my cat.  I HIGHLY recommend SF Pet Hospital.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find a vet that is as caring.</review>

Dr. Hunter is always so compassionate, knowledgeable, creative, and genuinely cares about the pets and their humans.  She also provided a warm hand off with Dr. Hancock to prepare for next steps for our sick cat as she was out of the office the following day. Dr. Hunter called the next day followed up on care, gave recommendations, and we had new medicines that night.  I'm beyond grateful for her and the team!  I have will continue to recommend them to everyone.</Review>

I just hanged up the phone with them. I have had my 6 year old Australian shepherd come to this office since she was a puppy.  Fortunately she is an extremely healthy dog and never needed urgent care.  We recently got a puppy and brought her for her vaccinations.  Several times I got conflicting information about the vaccination schedule and was confused because they gave her one more shot of DHHP vaccine than necessary.  When I inquired about it they said the doctor would call me to discuss.  That never happened.  They called me back to charge me for the vaccines and I again asked to speak to the doctor.  Never got a call back.  On Saturday, my now 4 month old puppy that chewed through a bottle of Tylenol and we rushed her to the ER.  She was hospitalized for 48 hours and is still not acting like herself.  The ER recommendation was to see her regular doctor and get one more blood test to make sure she has no liver damage (the past 2 tests were clear).  I called them to make an appointment explaining that the test needs to be given at the 72 hour mark. I am sorry, we don't have availability. Me: can I speak to the doctor please? Them: No, the doctor is in procedures right now and even if you talk to them, that will not change the outcome. We don't have availability. Me: this is an urgent matter, I need to see her regular doctor. Them: sorry, we can't fit you in today. Take her to the ER again. It is clear to me that they don't care about their patients, even the most vulnerable ones. Do yourself a favor and find a veterinarian who actually cares about their patients. This place may have good doctors (the doctors have been great in my experience) but if you can't count on them when it really matters, when your dog is actually in need, then it does not matter how good they are.<//text>

< Review>
My partner and I are first time puppy raisers and we took our dog to SF Pet Hospital for her first vet appointment to see Dr. Leyba and it could not have been a better first experience for both our dog Ivy and us as new pet parents. A happy experience  even during COVID where we couldn't go into the building with our pup. The vet techs were so friendly and attentive and Dr. Leyba took his time explaining his assessment and gave us supportive  and informative feedback on what to improve on, our dog seemed unphased by the whole experience. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for a vet!<//Review>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>We took our dog Sierra to San Francisco vet hospital because she had had a cough for over a month.  We had what we thought was a great visit.  Our dog was prescribed antibiotics and we were told that it might require refills to completely clear the cough.  Refills may be needed was even hand written on the bottle by the vet. When I called to ask for a refill, it took days for the vet to call me back.  When he did he completely changed his advise and told us they could no longer do anything and we would need an additional visit to an internal medicine vet.  When I called back to discuss this the vet never returned my phone call.  If you have questions afterward, I’d recommend going somewhere else.  They don’t seem to care enough to return phone calls or to follow up with a persistent problem.</Review>< response>

Friendly staff in an intimate space. We've been bringing our dog here for a few years now and they are super helpful, attentive, and we have found that they generally have appointment openings without much wait. Parking can always be a little difficult but drive around and you should be able to find street parking easily. If not, there is a parking garage at the Chase bank on Fulton a few blocks down (if your dog can walk) so you can always park there and not be worried about getting towed.<//Review>

<Review>We just moved here from Minneapolis and brought our 5 year old pittie mix Ellie with us and we were sort of worried about finding a good vet. Well, as luck would have it, SF Pet Hospital is right around the corner from our apartment and we were able to get an appointment within a few days. We saw Dr. Leyba and he was fantastic. Ellie went in for an anal gland expression and they were done in less than 5 minutes. Highly recommend and so thankful they’re so close!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1554920851621< /Time>< resp>

I took my dog to SF Vet for the past 8 years and was always pleased by the acre  they provided.  I worked with all 4 vets and I was very happy with all of them.  They are very skilled, well-trained and all have excellent communication skills. They never talked down to me or tried to baffle me with medical terminology.  They were also extremely kind and compassionate during my dogs final hours.  He recently passed away from a tumor at the age of 12.  They were incredibly kind and compassionate and helped me make my final decision with confidence.</text>

<Review>I have been using SF Pet hospital since 1988.  Dr. Morris has been our vet for more than three generations of cats.  He is absolutely the best vet.  He gives good advice and lets the pet owner make the appropriate decisions.  I would recommend Dr. Morris to any pet owner.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

And today I had an appointment to bring in a new cat, who's survived some pretty horrific mistreatment by a former owner, and they screwed up the scheduling so that I dragged the poor cat all the way to their office and then it turned out there was no appointment and they couldn't fit us in. I felt really bad that I put the poor little guy in his carrying case and hauled him over there for nothing, after all he's been through. They seem really disorganized and not super on the ball in general.< /review>< user>

I would be embarrassed to say I ever worked there.  Note to future employeers, don't hire from people who have worked at this location.  You will be disappointed in their work ethic.<//Review>< Pictures>

Went in and placed my order at 7:57pm and ordered a single Hula Hawaiian pizza, and was told it would about 5-10 minute wait. I didn't get my pizza until 8:35pm. A 37 minute wait for one pizza. This isn't the first time I've gone to this location and had this happen. At one point it took them like 45 minutes to get me my order when I was told it would be 20 minutes. While I was standing there for 35 minutes I also happened to notice a pepperoni pizza on the floor in the kitchen, it was there when I came in and still there when I left. If you've got that kind of time to kill go for it but personally I'll be taking my business elsewhere as it will take less time to drive to somewhere a little farther than to wait for my pizza here.< /Review>

Walked into the establishment to pick up my pizza, at the front a guy named Steven helped me out with my order and we had a nice exchange and overall was a very enjoyable experience. Got home and pizza was hot and tasty.</Text>

Out of all the Little Ceasers in this area I will always come to this one. It is cheap pizza but doesn't mean it has to be made cheap like the other ones do it. Here they don't skimp on cheese or sauce. The crust is well proportioned to all the toppings. But be ready for a 5min wait usually because they make every pizza practically fresh every time I have come. They are that good.< /Text>

Twice now this Little Caesar's Pizza has taken over half an hour for hot-and-ready items. I would have been fine if it was the ten minutes quoted to me but it was much, much longer.< /Text>

<Review>This location is new. Unfortunately they don’t understand the meaning of Hot-N-Ready because it’s the second time I come here and no pizzas are waiting. I would recommend you use the app and pick up. Otherwise you’ll be waiting a while.
I ordered pepperoni and cheese pizzas. They said 8-10 minutes and it’s now been 25 minutes and still waiting. The guys were fighting in the back because one was telling the other to help and the other said he was busy. Two guys working? Really? Several people left when they were told the wait would be 25-30 minutes.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dcc9a1d3252c5d:0xec95f03858955bb5</GmapID>< time>

Good food. But I got there early and he asked my order number. I stead of handing me my order, he put it in the warmer and I had to wait for others to pick up their order first....on top of that he didn't even put my sauce with it and I had to wait for him to go get my sauce....not the brightest bulb in the box!!<//text>

I was craving little ceases pizza as I hadn't had it in almost 10 years. Walked in hoping they had a piping hot pizza ready to go. Got lucky and they had several ready for sale. Choose the bestest cheese and pepperoni. Yum. $6.00 OMG can't beat that. Tasty and good. Thank you little ceases! !< /Text>

Order from the pizza portal for dinner or you will be looking at a 20+ minute wait for "hot n ready" items. There is always only 2 people working and 4-6 people waiting for food.<//Text>

Very nice people, but if you want a pizza hot and ready when you get there anytime after 5  call ahead and order or you will be waiting in a line.</Review>

This place sucks! Long lines no pizza ready when the slogan is Hot and ready. Poor management no one knows what their doing. Wrong orders 30 minute wait time. Never heard of thay for little Caesars. For that wait time i will be going elsewhere< /text>

It's the closest one near me, but the owner needs to help train or guide these new employees. Super slow. It's even faster to get my order out by going to another Little Caesars instead...<//Text>

<username>GEORGE Evans< /username><time>1540676659990</time><rate>1< /rate><Text>Horrible service.   I have been there twice and both times waited 30 mins or more for a pizza that was supposed to be ready.  The last time I was there I waited 30 mins and got the wrong order.  They told me it would be another 20 mins to get the right order.  Unacceptable and that would have been almost an hour that I was there for a "hot-n-ready" pizza.  Many people were there also complaining about the wait.  They should have never let me leave with the wrong order.  And 1 more thing, when i ordered my pizza, there was only 1 person ahead of me and I got my order, although wrong, before him.  And one more thing, the girl working the cash register took someone's order and then went in the back and started making pizza without washing her hands.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

One of the worst locations I’ve been to, they either always make you wait 30-40 minutes or never have anything. Three out of the four times I’ve been here they’ve made me wait more than thirty minutes just to tell me, when I check in to see if the order is ready, that they never had the ingredients in the first place. Save your time and money and go to another location.</Text>

Most items I have ordered here  I have liked. They do have many options some you have to go online to find. Only thing bad I have to say is they don't always make according to items they have listed online maybe that has to do with staff still being trained but either way I would recommend</Review>

Great for office lunches during covid times. They individually bag every meal and clearly label the contents inside.

Superb customer service and delicious food!<//text>

<text>This location has the best Ike’s staff in Fresno, hand and paws down.  Sandwiches are always the best.  The place where I met the love of my life.  So many sand which combinations, hard to keep track.  My girl loves the Jim Rome...I go between the Reading rainbow, the Marshan Lynch, and the Ménage a Trios.  Which there was a Star Trek themed sandwich (like Klingon Krunch or something) but I can see how challenging that would be.  Calling in is hit or miss but ordering in person the best, if you have ??? They have !!!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

When to get some takeout, the ménage a trois sandwich (has shredded chicken)was really flavorful and the Dutch bread was sweet and crunchy. I also preferred onions rings and they were a bit soggy. Maybe oil wasn’t hot enough.</review>

<Name>The Chosen 1</Name><Review>Loved this place in my old hometown, but hadn't been to this one (or any other Ike's) for almost three years.  This location was just as awesome as the ones I've been accustomed to and the staff was super friendly.  Not sure if it was the manager or not, but the lady that assisted us was genuinely friendly and went of her way to engage my kids in fun conversation.  She stopped by later to check in on us, make sure everything was going well, and make recommendations for next time...which will be much sooner than later.  The sandwich was fantastic as expected and we scored some coupons at the Bulldogs game, so that was an extra bonus.  The Menage a trois is the best!  As is Ike's!< /Review>< GmapID>

First the door was locked and sign said they were closed, although they were open and a customer had to keep opening the door for people to come in. The customer and I informed the staff twice. The cashier, not welcoming, rude and just made us have a terrible experience. I love Ike’s because of their veggi options. I always go to the one on palm and never have any issues, however this one has disappointed me. Definitely not coming back!<//review>

Pretty amazing! Wish the menu provided clear list of all options for making your own sandwich (meat and cheeses) but the service was delightful and the taste was amazing! Will come again. Nice to have a cream soda in a fountain as well.<//text>

<Text>I've had ikes several times but recently it's been getting worse and worse. Last time I walked in and ordered and they were out of several ingredients.

<Review>The "bouncer" is an angry little man. I'm not very tall, 5'10", and I swear the top of his head was at my shoulders. He might be a legal midget which makes more sense why he would be so angry. Anyways he tried starting a fight with my friends and I so we had to put the little guy in his place. Now we aren't allowed back even though he instigated the whole situation. Besides that the bar is cool.<//Review>< pics>

A place for locals.  Very reliable and dependable, consistent.  Just a standard bar, pool tables in the back, a back porch if you want to smoke.  At night it becomes more of a music club, very loud, younger crowd.  Parking stinks.</Review>

< review>
This place is extremely shady. In the only one time I went there I got my car keys, phone, wallet with my GC, jackets and even my chapstick stolen in plain sight of the couple security guards, two bartenders and a DJ...
The worst thing is that the place wasn’t even busy at all and I wasn’t even drinking at all!
I turned around  to dance with my friends to a couple of songs and all my items were gone without “anyone seeing anything” in a matter of minutes!
“Casually” a former employee “brought my phone back when the local police showed up, saying that “some people whom he knew so very well” happened to bring it to him to another local bar that’s located about 2 blocks away from McGees. HORRIBLE!
To me it was all pretty strange and totally uncalled for. I distrust the people who work there, I’m deeply disappointed at the owner’s poor communication and overall the stress and difficulty of it all.
This unfortunate event caused me to have a severe nervous break down, horrible stress that up to this day is causing me lots of difficulties.
The worst was also that even my sweaters and jackets were stolen, so I had to wait for at least an hour in the snowy weather with only a light shirt on!
I love supporting local businesses, but I consider it very confusing when someone who claims to support itself with the support of he local community  doesn’t care to have any type of business ethics and/or care for their customers!
Quite frankly I’m disappointed and will advise everyone who goes here to be cautious. I will not recommend this place to anyone. Ever!<//review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>On Saturday July 29th we (my wife and sis Victoria, stopped in to cool off, it was 98, during a day of shopping in Nevada City. We were visiting Grass Valley to attend my nephew's wedding on July 29th at the Empire Mine State Park (outstanding wedding venue).  To our surprise McGee's Annex is a retro bar where everyone knows your name and if you are new soon everyone knows your name.  We felt very comfortable.  Richie, the owner, made us feel at home.  We do not drink but his lemonade was GREAT. Richie was extremely friendly and engaging.  I recommend this Irish Pub to anyone visiting Nevada City.

Save a horse, ride a cowboy! it's not really dance music, but it will play, you know cause the Dj kinda sucks. At the same time, he's great and everyone gets drunk and dances their asses off on a Saturday. Drinks are priced well and if you get here before 10, no cover, just go buy a drink get a stamp and come back a few hours later for the fun!<//Text>

<review>Tons of choice. Good quality. Needed a few items for a small party. Went to Dollar Tree nearby but the line was outrageous. So glad I jumped over to Party City. Quality was good, I'll get to reuse this stuff many times. And no line to wait for checkout!<//review>< Pics>

Just go to Dollar Tree instead.  Party City charged $24 for six regular little balloons that deflated to the size of a grapefruit in 9 hours.</text>

<Review>I went right before closing and was happy with my trip. Found clearance items for an event I needed, store was clean and was treated very nicely. I will say, the employee was smoking right within the entry/exit door when I walked up to checkout rather than just smoking outside, but other than that this location is great.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Got amazing service when i first came in and made my purchase with catherine. However because i didn't have time for her to blow up my stuff and i have a tank at home. I figured I'd dyi it. Only to get home and run out out the unicorn. I drove all the way back to be net by Eliiis* with a bad attitude and unhelpful spirit</Review>

Lots of stuff to throw a party with. Party city light outside on the building needs to be repaired thought they were closed. Employees are hit and miss just like anywhere else in that level of retail. Actually found one who knew what she was doing and seemed to enjoy being there. I think her name was cheri, cute girl very polite. The prices are high on some things but they have it all. Didn’t have to go to multiple stores. FIX THE LIGHT!!!< /Review>

Several times they might know where an item you're looking for is, but dang do they get you close to it. Jeez, I mean there's just a ton of stuff to have to go thru and remember their locations so I sympathized their dilemma, ESPECIALLY when while helping you 20 people are asking questions of them about other stuff. AND I was apologized to when they were interrupted in solving my problem! Who DOES that on a seasonal job?!? Kudos to this staff, ya'll rock on with your awesome selves!!< /review>< resp>

I would say that Party City - there are a number of different outlets throughout San Diego County - is basically a department store that specializes in selling just about anything that you can imagine, especially when what you want revolves around the purchasing of presents or for staging any festive occasion.
Their plethora of merrymaking merchandise is there, awaiting your own inventiveness and creativity ; either plan the festivities yourself, with a few family members or friends and go for it...
They have supplies/gifts for baby showers, weddings, birthday parties of all ages and all kinds of what-you-may-call-its.
I just went there to browse and I walked out with some dice, a new deck of playing cards, and a small box of crayons.< /Review>

Told me I couldn't buy anything because they closed the drawer early and saw me for the last 15 minutes shopping for the baby shower tomorrow.  I said it's cool I'll just go somewhere else tomorrow,  and I got a reply "Yeah, it would probably be cheaper". No pride or customer service at this place. A shame and disgrace.</text>< name>

pretty underwhelming, especially since the staff is neither gonna say hi or thank you, and of course, they won't try to help, dont even expect a smile....the selection is not exactly inspiring, there s barely any light in there and it s not exactly well organized. the one costume i grabbed to maybe try was stained, in the packaging and basically stuffed back in ....most of there stock is probably not wven from this year...</Text>

Excellent customer service. I wanted a hard to find costume and they were able to get it for me and even gave me two options. Tons of merchandise and pictures on the wall of the choices. Great place for costumes.< /Text>

<review>The PC closest to my house (and the one I had planned to use) was out of helium so all of the balloons I had purchased online couldn't be blown up. I called them the day I needed them; they had helium and happily helped me blow up - literally an hours worth and car full - all of my balloons even though I had got them at a different PC. They saved the party!< /review>< time>

We went in to order balloons for a special occasion.   The staff was helpful and friendly.   Our order didn't take long at all.  Pleased with the prices and selection.< /review>

Party City is so overpriced. I only buy when I am in need and can’t get to Walmart or Amazon. The employees at this store needs to work on their customer service skills. This particular store feels cold and uninviting.< /Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Zero customer service. Took multiple employees to figure out they DON'T print custom banners. How do they not know this!? A "manager" left to call another store for us and more than 10 minutes later he never came back. Cold attitudes, not welcoming, incompetent half stoned OB staff.

<review>Thus place is amazing as always. The food is so good. You can go wrong with anything on their menu. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I love that if my drink is getting low they are there with a refill. You don't even have to ask.
Also the view is so beautiful.</review>< Date>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Excellent service, my experience was unique.
My girlfriend and I went for our 1st anniversary.
While doing the online reservation ,i mentioned that we were going for this special occasion and requested a nice table if possible.

By the time of our reservation they gave us one of the best corner tables with bay view. Our Server Jaime was phenomenal, he even brought us a Anniversary cake with a congratulations written on the plate.

Finally the food was amazing, it was Fresh and tasty.
Thank you for this experience, we will come back.</Review><Resp>None</Resp><user_id>102265364612316699199<//user_id><name>gian paul landerer< /name><GmapID>0x80deab0d284064d9:0xba249d609c190abe<//GmapID></record>

<Review>Iconic restaurant in San Diego. The restaurant was memorable before the remodel. Now its young and full of life. The patio seating is amazing during spring and summer days for lunch or brunch! Across the airport close to downtown, Seaport Village and Point Loma. Make your way here for lunch. You WILL thank me!<//Review>< rate>

Lunch here is OK. The views are great! but to book an event here.... forget it! Over the past three weeks I have been emailing, calling, and leaving messaged to book an event. Sharon Nelson (event coordinator) has replied with a generic email once and then nothing. She also does events on the side in her personal time, so it's evident that this is not her priority. It says that they will respond in 24 hours, but they do not. I finally gave up. I figured....if this is how the communication is going to be, I'd rather not have that headache. Extremely disappointing.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>This is a favorite spot for both local people and tourists! My husband and I went to Bali Hai restaurant before, which is Tom Ham’s sister restaurant, for the New Year brunch, we definitely loved it. So this time we wanted to try this one out. It’s right at San Diego Restaurant Week, so we ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. First the price is amazing, for brunch / lunch, it’s $20 for two course. I ordered Fish & Chips and chocolate mousse cake. My husband ordered Oysters and Lobster Roll. Both are super amazing, the foods quality and quantity are a hundred percent perfect. For drinks, both of us ordered their famous signature Mai Tai, it is a dangerous cocktail, super strong. One is enough for the whole brunch for sure. 😊 Anyways, we love this amazing restaurant, with the beautiful views and nice table service. We will come back soon!< /Text>< Pictures>

Extremely difficult to plan a family occasion and to reach their event coordinator. Had to email & call multiple times to try to get hold of someone (Perla) who took almost 11 days & a few calls to reply to each email. Asked to hold the outdoor lawn for a specific date but was told that they can't hold it until the covid19 restrictions are lifted and to keep checking. After 2.5 months of following up nobody replies to my emails or calls until they finally tell me the date I asked them to hold was given away to someone else that recently asked for it. And I was notified by another coordinator not the same one I was referred to the first time. Multiple people involved & each one was saying something different.
When I asked to have the manager give me a call and explain how that happend. The manager (Grant)  called me refusing to hear the problem or  miscommunication or even try to make another option or see if they can work out another day for my event. He disrespectfully told me they have no venue for me at Tomhams what so ever and hung up on me. Customers don't only look for the view. We look for respect, hospitality, & professionalism. And there are thousands of other beautiful venues/restaurants which offer that.</review>

Great view, great service, and amazing food. We shared a restaurant week trio of oysters, paella, and chocolate mousse cake. Even better was the chilled platter - so fresh, and the prawns were the best I've had in ages.</review>

<Review>Fantastic Sunday afternoon at Tom Ham's!Large patios with sweeping city and boating views. Excellent service from all staff. Menu had a nice variety. Very reasonable prices. No buffet right now. Very clean. Be sure to try the perfectly cooked steak frites. Calamari was the  best I've had in a long time, and was a  large  portion!<//Review>< Response>

If it would be my last meal, I wouldn't mind. Incredibly decadent meal from start to finish. Beautiful setting against the harbor and the wait staff was absolutely fantastic. My one and only complaint were the restrooms. Both upstairs and down stairs were in need of attention although in all fairness my trip here was on Valentines Day I cant imagine they had much time to attend.<//text>

<review>What can I say, we loved our experience here. I was mainly coming for the view expecting ho bum food but we were pleasantly surprised:

Pros:

Staff was SO helpful and friendly. They even brought another heater out by our table to help keep us warm.

Food - we ordered the chicken and shortrib dishes. Short Ribs were so great and the Brussels with the chicken were to die for. Chicken had a nice crispy skin.

Ambiance/vibe: SO great. We came for sunset and looking out at the harbor with charming music piling through the speakers was just perfect. When dark enough their beautiful outdoor lights sparkled on. So charming.

Cons:
Chicken was nothing special and could have benefited from a thicker sauce or stronger flavor

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Best buffet style restaurant I’ve ever eaten at. Nearly unbeatable views because it’s literally partially over the bay. Go here around sunset and sit outside for some of the best service, quality food, and unlimited champagne (hopefully still available now that COVID has ruined everything) in San Diego. Every time I visit San Diego, I make sure to visit Tom Ham’s because it has become a staple of our vacations. We always know the food and the service will be a cut above ANY other buffet or brunch restaurant I’ve been to in the Bay Area.<//review>< pics>

Great happy hour. Terrific service. Very good food. Gorgeous view of the harbor and heat lamps to keep you warm. Excellent beer list. You can get 4 oz, 8 oz, or 16 oz pours.< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Great restaurant with outdoor seating on Harbor Island. The view is great but the food is even better! There are a lot of waterfront restaurants with mediocre overpriced food just because their view but this place is not one. It has it all. We couldn't believe how great all of our dishes were. We got oysters, the salmon dish, steak, and brussel sprouts and every bite was amazing with so much flavor.<//text>< Pics>

Beautiful brunch experience.  We shared our dishes so we could try several things. Hands down the cinnamon toast crunch french toast was the best and most delicious French toast I've ever had.  Its very sweet so it was nice to share some omelet and shrimp as well. The service and attention was perfect.< /Text>

I booked a reservation yesterday through open table. I got lunch today with my mother since we both had the day off. We were greeted by some kind hostess who escorted upstairs to the outdoor deck to be seated. Shortly after, Molly, our waitress came by to take our order. We ordered calamari, a shrimp po boy, and chicken sandwich. The food was delicious. Service was pretty quick and attentive despite how busy it was today. Thank you Molly and the others for helping my mother and I have a lovely lunch together!

PS, lovely view! Also, make a reservation just in case. It was nearly full during lunch today.</Text>

I try to leave out the negative stuff, but just my opinion, don't order the sirloin. It was so tuff I couldn't eat it. That being said, had a great time at lunch. The view as spectacular and everybody that ordered fish really enjoyed there meals. I just ordered the wrong thing.</Review>

<Text>Let me start by saying the service was excellent!  Drinks were good, not amazing. Calamari appetizer was good.  Market fish dinner was quite bland and New York Steak was cooked perfectly.

Had a great meal outdoors on their lower level patio.  They have two outdoor eating areas as of October 2020 - the downstairs area was their private event section and the upstairs was the main restaurant and bar but now both are being used for outdoor restaurant dining - both have good view of the water.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><resp>None</resp><Text>Where do I start?? If i could give 6 star rating I would. It is without doubt a fantastic restaurant and you will not be disappointed. Currently they are seating everyone outside which is not bad thing considering the breathe taking views you will so much enjoy during your visit to the restaurant. I highly recommend a dinner time close to sunset time. We haven't even talk about the staff, I will definitely say they are one friendliness staff  I have came across. The hostesses greeted us when we check-in and let us know when we should be seated. The waiter was funny and gave very good recommendation. The food was cook to perfection and my Mai Tai was strong but very good. The whole experience could not have been any better and we will definitely be back in the near future. Definitely recommend this place for that special occasion or just because you want to for your love one.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I liked the food here! Location is everything and food is fantastic! There is plenty of parking here so you're ok. Came here for seafood and let's just say I have no complaints! Food was delicious. I gave this place 4 stars because I feel that distance here isn't quite 6 feet per table. We asked for a table that was in the corner but apparently that table was reserved 6 weeks in advance! Whatever! Anyway, other than that it was good. Our server tried his best to accommodate us and we were happy with service. Loved it!!< /Text>< Pictures>

Beautiful view of SD, the food was delicious, and phenomenal service. Will definitely be coming back next time we are in town. Bouillabaisse will not disappoint if you like seafood. Plus the sourdough bread they serve is delicious!</review>

Based on a friend’s recommendation, we came for Sunday brunch for the first time.  We made a 9:45AM reservation and requested a window table.  There was one available when we arrived.  We were seated promptly.  The view was spectacular!  Toward noon, the sun came though the window, so bring your sunglasses.

Service was excellent!   They were very attentive.   My champagne glass was never empty.   The finished plates were promptly taken away.  The buffet food was restocked frequently.   No complain!

Food:  the Maine lobster claws, oysters, cocktail shrimps, crab legs, and scallops were so fresh!  The cooked food and desserts were delicious!  Pasta and omelette station were very inviting.  There was bottomless mimosas (you can mix orange juice and champagne yourself).  We leave the restaurant satisfied.   One word summary:  yummy!<//text>

The view is amazing, especially at a Thanksgiving night. The waiter gave a good recommendation of white wine to my salmon entree. Even during pandemic, all the staff makes sure they practice safety for all their guests. Everytime a customer comes in to dine they get a new tablecloth. It's a great initiative to show how the restaurant cares more than just the food they serve.</Text>

<Review>This place was fantastic. Our waiter Edwardo treated us right. He had everything on our table at lightning speed. Somehow he would ninja with a drink refill as soon as I set my empty cup down. The calamari starter was perfect. The shrimp linguini was delicious. Blown away by the service, the food, and the speed of our food from order to table. Highly recommend!! Oh and don't forget an amazing view out of the water.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9k01nX74PyNj95vuL1GGePf2DdmuZeRUxyxMw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8YQ6W6M1wkl90PyBftdqUHshhSej5IkiqR046=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-B_imDKa9IqvS3350NOZAPjtgp_FCk5l79SON=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-PyajsR1iZtclRC4W98XD9XgsXr_SWNGI0hhA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

<text>I went there on Sat for lunch with my best gf for the first time. We both ordered the lobster roll. Honestly it wasn't that good. They put minced tomatoes and onions with the lobster. Why?? They barely give you any lobster on top of that. The fries that came with it was good and crispy. Definitely I had way better lobster roll at Pete's seafood and Ironside. Those are my two fave places for lobster rolls! I'm a big  seafood person so it was lil disappointing with our sandwiches. Overall, 3 stars because the view was awesome!</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo7IrbGGuM3-d4oFOrqdw8YNeV4hxs8RC0s8lg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

Went here with a group for dinner. The sunset views are amazing. We tried several appetizers and they were all great. I decided on the New York strip steak cooked rare. The steak tasted amazing and the demiglaze was the kicker... great steak. Would suggest this place for a romantic dinner.<//Text>

I stayed at the Hilton on Harbor island for two weeks for my birthday vacation and it was my first time there. I was so happy to find out that a restaurant was so close to my hotel and I was even happier when I experienced the restaurant first hand!
Everything about this restaurant is perfect, the food, the views, and definitely the staff!
I went to this restaurant multiple times everyday for two weeks and every time I went I was extremely pleased with everything this restaurant has to offer!
The restaurant staff here is the best service you will find and always willing to accommodate!
The Bartender Rafael is the best you will ever have!
He provided excellent customer service and because of him I will definitely be coming back!</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Ambience: Pleasant environment, cheery staff, and the views of San Diego harbor and downtown are spectacular.  Even on Saturday night it didn't feel crowded.  Nice, open floor format with views from any table however the prime spots are outside on the balcony/deck.

Food: I had the special, whole fish (head, bones, tail and all) and I absolutely loved it.  My mom, dad, brother and sister all swiped pieces off my plate because it was so delicious.  The fish when I went was a Chilean sea bass.  My dad had paella which he enjoyed very much and my brother had shrimp pasta that he raved about as well.  My mom ordered a filet medium well (a sin in my opinion) so I didn't bother trying hers.  My sister had the chicken which was delicious with the bone in.

Service: The wait staff, food runners, and hosts were all very pleasant and accommodating.  It was my mom's 61st birthday dinner and she had an amazing time.

Parking: Extra kudos for a dedicated parking lot otherwise parking on the street would be a pain.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEqY_Q7yC9Fg0QJPns1LqVBywAGD4SOFTWaG7i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfw6Au0uIBWNykGag1uJaA6s8S3DK7lcpdvp1q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

We really enjoyed the food & atmosphere. Our waitress was super friendly & accommodating! The crab BLT was delish and large enough to share. The new style french fries are so dangerously good! My mom got fish and chips and they were excellent.< /Review>

Amazing restaurant pairing great foods with great views!!  Have gone here three times over the last two years and have been dazzled each time.  Once was during restaurant week, and the other two for special dates with the wife.  More expensive than your typical place, but not out of this world.  The views and food make the price well worth it.   Happy on every trip here 5/5 would recommend!</Review>

<text>The view was great but the food could have been better. Most of the seafood was all served cold so it didn’t really have any strong taste so I used their sauce but tasted like it had wasabi mixed in both sauces and not a fan. I also got a crab and avocado omelette which wasn’t very flavorful. Would have preferred more cooked options or heard there used to be a buffet.. that would have been better.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80deab0d284064d9:0xba249d609c190abe<//gmap_id></record>

This review only covers the banquet hall areas of Tom Ham's. I have been there now three times for different business meetings. The banquet rooms are very nice there's a great outdoor area to stand and have a cocktail looking at the city scape and the water. They have a nice little beer and drinks bar to purchase a cocktail or a beer and there food that I have had even well served buffet-style was very very tasty and well prepared. I can't wait till I have a free minute to take my wife to the actual restaurant to check it out but I'm sure we won't be disappointed</text>

Second time here. The first time I came with a girlfriend and we loved it. Brought my husband back and he loved it too! Our waiter was excellent! I’m a vegetarian and my husband has celiacs disease. They were very accommodating and he didn’t have an gluten issues.

Very safe during COVID and obviously the view is gorgeous. Fun to watch the boats go by!</text>

Food was great. Server was excellent and in a beautiful location. Only thing is there was a wedding reception going on and the music was rather loud downstairs. Not much can really be done except maybe sound proof the top floor better. Would definitely come back though.< /Text>

Had a solo dinner at Tom Hams this evening and all I can say is WOW! From the hostess, to the server (Brad) and to the Chef - amazing! Everything is absolutely top notch, including the view, the staff, the ambiance and of course, the food. Even tho I was dining solo, my server never made me feel rushed and took care of me as if I was a party of 10. I will be back every time I am in San Diego! Highly recommended!< /Review>

Happy birthday to my sweet husband. Went to Tom Ham’s Lighthouse for a birthday. Even better was restaurant week was going on. So we got a appraiser, main dinner plate, and a dessert for $40! We went crazy. Everything was wonderful! Love the baby octopus on avocado bread. My husband said best Salmon he ever had in his life. Thank you for a wonderful night and a very happy birthday to my amazing husband!</review>

Went there for my birthday and loved it! Very tasty food (we tried the scallops with grits, crispy artichokes and sausage, the market fish and a seafood soupstew). Our waiter was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. They also have an amazing selection of unique drinks (tried their cucumber gin martini and quite liked it). Looking forward to visiting again and trying their craft beers!</Text>

The management was kind of rude but overall everyone was very friendly and professional. Food was good and view was amazing. Will definitely go back but the management needs to stay out of the front desk or get a better attitude.<//text>

Great seafood restaurant with fantastic views of San Diego bays and the ocean, as well as downtown. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and efficient with their service. Good selection of wine and beer, and the portions are generous. Right next to the airport, and a short drive from most hotels.</Review>

The reviews for the Sunday Brunch is what brought us in. The buffet style brunch was wonderful and the view of the city made it a great setting. There is wide selection to choose from for brunch.
The wait staff never made you feel rushed and were very helpful when needed.
Defiantly a brunch I will return to when in town.<//review>

The seafood tower was ridiculous and lavish!  Three tiers of mouthwatering seafood: from clams, scallops, mussels, crabs, Lobster, and of course shrimp everyone gets to enjoy their favorites.  You'll need four other friends to help you though.

Their bisque was good and clam chowder wasn't bad either!

A nice venue that's used for various events and celebrations< /review>

Such a great joint. 👍 Love it. Amazing view and vibes, delicious food, strong draft-beer selection, very charming, etc. At the end of Harbor Island, just across from Shelter (Island). I highly recommend Tom Ham's Lighthouse.</review>

We went here on our anniversary and it was great, our waiter “ Phillip” was the best and was very helpful with recommendations. We had the lobster corn dogs and some steaks which were very delicious. The view here is amazing especially if you reserve a table to catch the sunset<//text>

We visited on Thanksgiving and were beyond satisfied.  The buffet was amazing with fresh seafood including King Crab legs, Lobster claws, Scallops, Oysters and of course oven roasted Turkey and the quintessentially Californian Tri tip roast carved to order.  Service was attentive and the view over the bay as the sun set was perfect.  I will go there anytime I'm in the area.< /text>

We came here once before, for our 3 year anniversary and we loved it! We got lucky with outside seating and got a wonderful table looking out to the gorgeous view. Staff is very friendly and courteous, while service is top notch. The food is amazing. Hubby had the Cioppino, while I had the Lobster Roll. Both were very tasty with both of us loving the lobster roll. We also had the shrimp and corn appetizer, which was ok but kind of greasy and heavy.

This year we went back for our 6th year anniversary, and this time we brought our kids along. Once again everything was wonderful. And it was even more fun with the kids! Our 5 year old really loved the view! We'll definitely be back again.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxYz10GoeAKlbKglK7L8lKPNzNGy2o5ygPpzJ6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpBkT0eAJ20PSflMu4F4YWvTYN3MDdchGo_ayY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHmBi9oylQ6HQ920HBn0xUxU82FFlpclIfjQ-0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHBNhXhnVtlW1_TwnAsS_RmoqJ0ogSgbMWVJ82=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0k5Ot7ITyxSf_5VdM-tQwqQu1X7phhsszn2q7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

Out of towner that was here for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  GREAT location in downtown San Diego.  Easy to get to, plenty of parking, along with handicap accommodations.

As for the food, it was absolutely fantastic!  From the cheeses, entrees and dessert, everything was tasty!  The wait staff was attentive to our needs and it was a beautiful venue.  It was slightly pricey after looking at the main menu, but it was worth it!  Definitely a must go for view and food!   The view gives you a scenic view of San Diego.</Review>

It's a amazing location with incredible views!
Calamari was very good!
Salmon was way under cooked. They replaced with yellowtail (it was over cooked. Lol). Overall, food was less than stellar.<//review>

Best oyster happy hour in San Diego. Love this place. Love their drinks. They have a Peanut butter pain killer and it’s amazing. Also one of the prettiest views to eat at in San Diego.<//text>

<Text>Outdoor dining for my birthday. Happy hour appetizers of calamari, beet salad and steak tidbits were good. Watched sailboats perform their synchronized sailing. I was a bit disappointed with the food. My sirloin steak was dry and tough. The service was gracious and allowed us plenty of time to relax and have quality time with my family.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>First time here. What an awesome place. Easy to get to and easy parking. The only thing better than the food and service was the view. Wow what a perfect place for a sunset dinner and a view of the city. Seafood platter was delicious as well as our other food as well, scallops and duck breast. Will absolutely be one of our favorite places to enjoy an nice dinner.<//Review>< time>

< Review>
I had the infamous champagne brunch today. It was everything that its cracked up to be. There is an omelette station which is cooked to order. The deserts were endless. My favorites were the snow crab, shrimp, and short ribs. It is kind of pricey but definitely worth the experience. The decor and ambience were inviting and classy. I would call to make a reservation. The view of the harbor made the day even more spectacular.</Review>

The lighthouse offered a view of the bay and we had lots of entertainment with the boats, jet skis, and naval base. The food was great and the drink prices were good. Much better than our hotel bar.

<rating>2</rating><Text>I came here with a bunch of friends for the Sunday brunch. The seafood wasn't that fresh. There was a good selection of seafood. From shrimp cocktail, raw scallops, lobster claw, oysters and snow crab legs. But that was the biggest selection on food. There was a omelet and pasta station. Some breakfast items like sausage, bacon and some other items. A craving station of tri tip. Bottom less champagne. The best thing was the view of this restaurant.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfsdzDu71uJ6S408HM5p31ucnf-uRtA4M-HCOx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl8IrKlIIS6c3sB4CdF_n8h5rTeakWabKqS59r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>The views alone are worth checking this place out! At night come for apps and drinks and enjoy a view of the lit up city!

During the day, the harbor is a beautiful backdrop and tons of natural light bathes your table or you can even sit outside on the deck.

The food hasnt blown me away but it's ok! Hubby had a cheese plate that was fine and he shared a seafood platter with some friends. I've tried the ceviche and a cocktail (Saucy Sally) and they were both middle ground. That being said, the view is enough that we plan to go back to try some other plates!</review>< Pics>

Such  A great place For an evening. The food was spectacular in fact my salmon was crunchy on the outside but so moist on the inside. We had the Tri tip starter and that meat was fantastic it was accompanied with grits I am glad that I went here and got to experience such wonderful time.</Review>

<Text>When this is a work trip... what is there not to enjoy? Nestled on the western tip of Harbor Island Park, I found perhaps the best view of San Diego Bay. Add the joy of learning it was restaurant week and a drink and entree was $15, and I would say day 2 of this trip is going very well. Ask to be seated outside for the same view.</Text>< pics>

Had a wonderful birthday dinner with my husband here. The views were amazing and the food was great. The yellowtail is incredibly flavorful. I think the cocktail I got was called a sassy sally which was amazing and very sweet. Our server was great too I think his name was Eddie !< /Text>

The food was just ok. Not anywhere close to the type of taste and quality you would expect for the price. The service was horrible. Our waitress spent her time on the tables on both sides of us to talk very loudly about how much she disliked tourists. When she did actually wait on our table she was not friendly with us at all. We ordered oysters as a starter and ended up getting our salads before the oysters came out. She only acknowledged the error by stating she would put a hold on our entrées. Which we later found out that that meant they had already cooked them, however she just didn't bring them to our table right away. Food was barely warm by the time it reached our table. As a place that is a tourist destination with amazing views. You would think the server would have an appreciation for the tourists dollars. Sadly this was not the case.<//review>

This is a mixed review.  The setting is beautiful. We ate outside on the second level facing downtown, lights, etc.  They didn't honor our reservation for a window table which had been made over a week before.  They gave us a fine dessert for our anniversary.  The service was very good. The food was just OK, especially for the price.  The real negative was the bill which came with a 3% surcharge which was unannounced and not mentioned in the menu.  Not a large amount but why have a menu with prices and then increase them on the bill?<//text>

<text>Updated 10/16/20:
Ever since I found this place, I've wanted to take my dad during his next visit. We went today for lunch. Gorgeous day! The downstairs patio was fully shaded with umbrellas.

The crab BLT was delish and large enough to share. The new style french fries are so dangerously good!  My mom got fish and chips and they were excellent. My sister got a burger, and she loved it.

Our waiter was outstanding! He couldn't have done a better job for us. My dad was so impressed with him (Roger). Our drinks were refilled regularly. He was friendly and knew a lot about the Destroyer when my dad asked about it.

Thanks so much for the amazing lunch and taking care of my fam!

09/10/19:
+ Made reservations, showed up, and superb table had been reserved on the patio for lunch.
+ The view, the view, the view!
+ French fries were excellent - very fresh.
+ Lobster roll filling excellent - very flavorful.

- They don't do anything to acknowledge birthdays.
- Hostesses were not overly attentive or welcoming; server was not overly attentive or friendly.
- Server didn't check in on food after it was delivered for quite a while, and we were missing an element.
- Lobster roll (bread) bland; it didn't enhance filling just muted it. Ended up eating the filling out of then bread with a fork.< /text><time>1602992869472<//time><user_id>100026604125311442889</user_id>< gmap_id>

Nice location, I believe it was remodeled since last time I came here in 2013, brunch is well known, I went to a special celebration so the menu was probably different. The oysters in the iced counter does not look appealing but when I ate years ago I didn’t have any major issue.<//text>

<Text>Tom Ham's on Harbor Island is a long established restaurant with outstanding views of San Diego's harbor and the city skyline. I have been there many times for dinner and to enjoy the view. This time we were there for lunch. It was a rainy day but the view from our table by the window was still very nice. My friend had the crab louie salad and I had the lobster roll. The food was good and it was a pleasant place for lunch.</Text>< pictures>

Iconic restaurant on San Diego bay, never have had bad service or food.Once again not disappointed. I have been there many times as well as their sister restaurant Bali Hai. Fresh seafood, great Sunday brunch.  Make reservations at least a week in advance
You won't be disappointed.<//text>

< Review>
We got the lobster roll, and it was a bit of a rush because we came at the end of the lunch hour. The waiter was great enough to warn us to order ASAP so that we could get the Restaurant Week deal so I appreciate that! We also got the calamari for appetizers and ice cream for dessert. The calamari was great, but I think it's hard to mess that up! The lobster roll is good and flavorful. Even if the food wasn't this good, the view is just amazing!</Review>

Best Sunday all you can eat seafood buffet with bottomless mimosas. They've got lobster. They've got two kinds of crab. They've got oysters. They've got scallops. They have peel and eat shrimp. Ceviche. Fish.
Free parking
Gorgeous views of the bay
Attentive staff
Full bar
Tv's to watch the game on
Patio for outdoor dining available.< /review>

The food, the venue, the waitstaff, absolutely everything was perfect having our wedding at Tom Hams.  It was truly the most classy venue.  People are still raving about the food, saying it’s the best wedding food they’ve ever had.  But the wedding coordinators Brooke and Perla truly made planning our wedding seamless.  Most wedding venues you have to get your own coordinator.  These two women helped me with every detail and made our wedding day the best day ever.  Hands down the best venue to get married at in San Diego!< /text>

<review>Everything we ate was very disappointing. The brisket sand which was very dry, bland and chewy, the burger was greasy, and dripping; the cheesecake was pretty, but dry and barely sweet. The waitress was very nice, and brought dishes out properly, however they had numerous foodrunners that would just put the wrong plates in front of everyone without asking, and didn't get a single dish to the proper person. There was a young blond guy that brought dishes to the right people but the soup was splashed around from him carrying 4 dishes at once. The selection is incredibly limited for lunch, and the menus list a price, but say at the botton that there is an additional 3% added due to rising costs, rather than just properly raising rates.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOntUFACZFfdincrQKZxBxDz9IrZJ4gZYP8Zqn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Tom Ham's should be ashamed of themselves for NOT adhering to COVID19 policies. Management has been directly overheard that they will NOT enforce mask rules for indoor dining when not actively eating or drinking... Leaving dirty dishes on the table doesn't qualify as actively eating!!
Owner Suzy has suggested that they are doing the best they can,while Grant/Andy or managers on duty continuously allow patrons to NOT follow indoor dining restrictions. This establishment has hosted wedding receptions within the last two weeks which is NOT allowed under San Diego County policy setforth on Sept 10.
Employees who inform the management of policy are asked to mind their own business.
Restaurants that CANNOT follow the restrictions setforth for the Gen public safety as well as the safety of employees SHOULD NOT be allowed to operate at this time. Shame on the Lighthouse owners for not upholding the standards setforth by family generations before them!!<//Text>

Congratulations to Mrs SHR!!! And Thanks to Tom Ham's for hosting this amazing Bridal Shower.  Shout out to the bride's sisters for picking this place.  Great choice!

Tea Party? Ah Yes, my very first Tea Party and it was absolutely gorgeous and exquisite design done by the bridal party.

Food was delicious!  From cheese charcuterie and calamari appetizers to lobster roll and putting calamari in the roll was one of the best thing I have ever ate.

So chill yet it was memorable.  Best restaurant to throw any event.

3 years ago....
We came here for my friend's rehearsal dinner and it was lovely.  The food was delicious and the view was very calming.  Our section had an opened area and it was easy for people to socialize.  It was the perfect place to get people together before the big day.  Big thanks for my friend for booking the place, and maybe will come back here on their 10-year anniversary.  Cross fingers and wishful thinking. :)<//Review></record>

Kinda bummed I forgot to take more pics while I was there, but seriously a beautiful venue. Need to call and request window or outside seating (they are hard to come by during peak hours/days). Perfect for anniversary dinners. Will. Be. Back.</review>

First, Tom Ham’s Lighthouse is an absolutely fantastic location! The service was great and the food and cocktails gourmet. My only disappointment was that they didn’t offer more locally sourced seafood options. I don’t want to order seafood from Maine when I’m in California!
On the other hand, the petite oysters were delicious, some of the best oysters I’ve ever eaten!< /review>

I don’t know what you need to do, but whatever it is that will leave you with room enough to try ALL THE THINGS, do it! Everything was delicious from the pancakes to the crab and lobster and everything in between. As an added cherry on top, the very kind wait staff comes around and fills your mimosa glass the moment it looks remotely half full. It is well worth the price (but like I said, show up hungry to get all the bang for your buck)- what a fun brunch!< /text>< Pics>

Excellent customer care and exceptional views.  We relaxed on the patio as I indulged in a gin cucumber gimlet 🦋~ very good.

My son had 1/2 crab on ice(Chesapeake bay)= 👌🏻
I had the calm chowder.
Calamari(Baja) = marginal, dipping sauce confused the palate.

Suggestions~ snazz up the menu a bit with some local fare.  Perhaps, some local farm seasonal items?  Lots of opportunity for growth.

Four stars for the view.

Food can improve.  It seemed most items (we ate) originate across the country.

Celebrate California ☀️<//Text>

We ate here on June 13th ... we were glad to have a meal out after the terrible lock Downs.  this is an excellent location and great views of the Bay.  Unfortunately the table service was poor as our waiter never checked on the quality of our meal and are appetizer dishes were never picked up. We had a 1/2 lobster and a sirloin steak. The lobster was about average but the sirloin was extremely poor and for $34 it was a joke. We would not recommend this establishment.  Virus covied protections were good but the meal was well overpriced.<//text>

<Review>I have been to Tom Ham's Lighthouse for brunch many times and I am never disappointed.  I leave happy and extremely full.  They have a variety of foods, such as the usual fruit, bacon, sausage and Eggs Benedict.  They also have other items such as fresh salads, meats, cheeses and lox.

However the highlight of my time at Tom Ham's Lighthouse is the Massive Seafood Bar.  This bar contains crab legs, lobster claws, peel and eat shrimp, oysters, scallops and ceviche.  Everything is so fresh and delicious.  The cocktail sauce is amazing and contains the right amount of horseradish.  BOMB!!

Tom Ham's also has a great pasta and omelette station. I recommend taking some of the seafood from the seafood bar, and shucking or shelling it all and taking it the pasta and omelette station to put inside of your pasta or create an egg scramble.

Tom Ham's is amazing and one of my favorite Brunch spots.  They take Walk Ins, but I recommend you make a reservation on Open Table in advance.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

The major perk of this place: The views, for sure! We ate outside on a sunny afternoon and the building blocked the winds, so we were quite comfortable! Our server was very nice and even cracked a few jokes.

I had to give it 3 stars though because the food was just meh. It costs >$50 a person to have an all you can eat buffet that isn't that good. We started out with the seafood--lobster, crab, oyster, scallop--and it was bland, didn't taste fresh or interesting, and none of us went back for seconds. I went for the eggs benedict next, and also found it bland. I guess my favorite dishes were the bread budding and the french toast, but I can get those things for much cheaper elsewhere.

For the view it's almost worth it, but I wouldn't recommend it ultimately unless $50 doesn't mean much to you.</review>

< Review>
I've been celebrating special occasions at Tom Ham's phenomenally good Sunday Brunch for years with one of my best friends. I recently bought her a gift card for the brunch for her birthday and the envelope somehow got lost at with all the ruckus at her birthday party. I spoke with Grant, the manager (on a busy Saturday night, no less) and he was so awesome. They had a new card ready for me first thing monday morning. I have always loved the food, service and view. But they deserve 10 stars for going above and beyond! Can't wait till my next visit!</Review>

<review>Great view. Delicious food. Excellent waitstaff. This was our first time at Tom Ham's and we will return. It is also a great locmcation for a meal before or after dropping someone off at the airport or picking them up. It is a wonderful place to say "welcome to San Diego" or "please visit again".</review>< Name>

I took my wife here for our wedding anniversary.  I was looking for a place on the water, with a view, has outdoor seating, good seafood and oysters.  Tom Ham's fit the bill.  Beautiful view of the SD skyline, Coronado and tons of boats out on a warm summer evening.  They had 7 varieties of oysters on the menu, we tried 5.  All delicious.  I got the whole fish which was rockfish for the evening.  Normally I don't go for rockfish but I've never been disappointed with the whole fish and this was no exception.  I really couldn't get over how good it was and how perfectly it was prepared.  Tom Ham's wasn't on the top of my search results, but I'm glad I found them and gave them a try.  Oh, and the wait staff (sorry sir, but I forgot your name) was professional, polite, knowledgeable and right on top of everything.  It was the perfect evening.<//review>

My future husband and I LOVE Tom Ham's. We booked it for our wedding in July and keep coming back in the mean time for the epic food and awesome beer choices, plus the view and friendly staff (thanks for making TH's our second home Tim, Joe, Ian and Michelle!). Their 30ish beer taps change constantly and they have a great selection of SD and other craft beers. The happy hour has great deals on the food and drink, and $1 oysters. The regular menu is pricey, but the food is top notch and delicious. Plus the view.</text>

Stopped by for happy hour at the bar.  Great view of the city!  Nice selections on the menu for food.  Appetizers were very good and plentiful portions.  Service was good and definitely will stop by again.  Definitely stop by when in the area!<//text>

<Text>We had an event on Saturday, February 29th at 12pm. The location, cleanliness and food was superb. But what stood out the most were the employees. They were kind, helpful and had great attitudes. They even helped us remove items from our vehicle. I highly recommend this place and we will return.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< time>

<text>Love this place. After a cruise around the bay on the yacht, I’m finding this to be a trend to stop in for one and chat with the locals. Good beer selection and food is excellent. I had the blue fin tuna and oysters for a dinner. With a view of this beautiful San Diego Bay, life sometimes don’t get better than this.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVIy9LeRLnZcdbX7FecLI6zLpZm13FKtbVS73_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80deab0d284064d9:0xba249d609c190abe< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<time>1583380379299</time><review>Nice deck seating with heaters. Beautiful view. Service was good but I was extremely disappointed with the food. I was meeting some gal pals for a light meal. Their food looked good. The ceviche I ordered was chopped tomatoes with very little else. Teensy bits of shrimp like the ones you buy in a can, except minced. Would definitely pick something else on the appetizer menu if I ever go back. Roasted cauliflower looked yummy and so did the tenderloin tips. Salad looked fresh.<//review></record>

<userid>106713085597358715258</userid><text>Food was good, service was good. But, I had the Sunday brunch and it was the most expensive meal I have ever eaten.  After tax, fee, and tip I was out $70 for one person!!!
The seafood was minimal effort fair. All boiled, no interesting seafood dishes.
There was at least twice the variety on the desert table than everything else. They were very good deserts. But, for something advertised as a seafood brunch I was hoping for more variety in the main meal and considering the price, I was extremely disappointed I did not find it there.
I guess you are paying for the atmosphere and the view of the harbor.< /text><rate>3</rate>< date>

Had a worse experience for my husband's birthday. We reserved the table and asked to be seated outside on a terrace. The girl on a phone confirmed our reservation. After 1 hour drive with friends from out of state we were told that our reservation was for inside not outside ( the terrace was the main reason we reserved it) The manager and owner both said WE ARE NOT OF PRIORITY!!! Shame on rhem! The customer service was horrible!!</review>

One of the best places to watch San Diego skyline turn to gold during sunset! Outdoor deck with heaters and great menu. One of the few places you can get duck breast. Yum! Also an amazing wedding venue! We renewed our vows under their outdoor arbor with incredible SD Bay and city views. I thought their pricing was very reasonable as well. Huge indoor/outdoor area for buffet, dancing etc. Our friends and family were blown away and cant stop talking about the magical evening they had! Best night of my life....< /Review>

Oh my Goodness. This is the best Sunday Brunch Buffet with seafood in San Diego County. Sure you can pay a bit less and have something okay but this is literally the best! And the only one with lobster claws. The crab legs and claws are the meatiest as well. Scallops, oysters, shrimp, ceviche for the scared. All the meats, pasta, omelets, breakfast, smoked salmon, every dessert and a high class champagne.<//text>

<gmapID>0x80deab0d284064d9:0xba249d609c190abe< /gmapID><review>So maybe it was just an off day. We went for restaurant week we ordered from the restaurant week menu. They charged usfor bread for the table.  When I ordered the fried calamari and the lobster roll from the lunch restaurant week menu it did not say that the lobster roll came with French fries. I would not have ordered the fried calamari if I knew that there were French fries with the lobster roll. The lobster roll was not big and chunky but kind of flaked off lobster meat. At the end of the meal he forgot the desert.   The   cioppino did not have big chunks of meat but rather little pieces that were mistaken for potatoes.    The desert said it was a New York cheesecake which is inaccurate as New York cheesecakes do not have a gram cracker crust. The waiter was nice enough but once he realized we weren't going to be big spenders I feel that his  attention was being spent elsewhere... Over all it was a decent meal, the views are beautiful.</review></record></dataset><record>

This place was amazing!! Definately has a lot of class, style and the sunset views of the city was beautiful.

My lovely lady took me to this restaurant for my birthday, it was the best possible location she could have reserved.

The food was amazing, i had an entre i can't even pronounce lol but it was the only one with lobster i believe. The lobster was delicious and the sauce really topped off the taste and flavors. It came with 2 sliced tosted breads to dip, scallops and clams. I am probably not doing the dish any service with my limited description but I'm not a chef so trust me when i say, their food is more than worth it.

The customer service was exceptional, the server knew everything about their dishes and had a very well creative and articulate manner in how to describe it to us. The wine was really good but maybe i could have chosen a white wine for my dish, i don't do white wine much.

Their dessert was delectable and just the right amount after a full entre. I had a cream brulee if that's the way you spell it, otherwise, my mistake, i don't feel like googling it or spell checking right now.

The view was really nice, when the sun is up you can see the ocean and the sailboats up close just underneath the patio or balcony seating. When the sun sets, you get beautiful views of the San Diego skyline. It is a great place for photos with a loved one, family or friends after your meal.

The food came out in a timely manner and the whole experience felt like this restaurant runs like a well oiled machine. I can't see why anyone would care to give them anything less than a 5 star.

I'd love to keep rambling on about this place but i got to work. Definately recommend it to anyone.<//Text>

Great view with an ocean breeze if you dine on the patio. Prime dining view of the San Diego Skyline & Coronado.
The lunch menu is very reasonably priced. I tried the Crab BLT at $16, the sandwich was large and includes a side choice of salad or fries.
Come for the food and stay for the view.< /Text>

<Text>Brunch, Brunch, Brunch, Do it! It is only on Sunday bet well worth it. Just be sure to make reservations. This play is vegetarian friendly, not a lot of options on vegans. A the brunch price point I wound not say it is worth the visit for vegans. But if you eat sea food, Its a Must! Hands Down and again great views.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

We dined at Tom Ham's Lighthouse with family visiting from out of town. The food was excellent, the view was restorative, and the service was perfect (not too much or too little). We sat outside and even though it's a large restaurant, the seating is organized so that you don't feel on top of other tables.</review>

Had the best dining experience. Our waiter (his name started with a D) went
above and beyond the call of duty.
Definitely will go back.< /review>

Oh yeah! Seafood Sunday brunch is really worth the trip.  Great setting with view of Mission Bay,  shellfish galore, omlettes to order, mimosas, and attentive and efficient service. Make a plan to check this one out.< /text>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>A beautiful spot for a wedding venue. I've worked several weddings here over the years and the sunsets reflecting off of downtown are a great backdrop. The last wedding I was here for a baby dolphin swam by, I think that's a good luck sign, right?

Cons: I don't love the wedding arch, but that could just be personal taste. The food is solidly good, especially for a wedding, but is pretty standard.< /text>< rating>

My fiance and I checked out this place as we had an appointment scheduled for a possible wedding venue. The coordinator we met with very was very professional and courteous, answered all our questions and showed us around. We loved the views the venue has (Coronado and downtown SD) and loved how quiet the place is deposited being close proximity to the airport. We decided to try lunch after our appointment and the food was just as amazing. We split the white cheddar burger, cooked perfect medium and the fish and chips. Excellent flavor and just the right crispiness. We decided to use this venue as our choice for our wedding and do not regret the decision.</Text>

Tom Hams atmosphere before sunset is the best in San Diego. They have an awesome Happy Hour menu and the service to match. If you're looking for a place from 3-6pm downtown, Tom Hams does not disappoint.</review>

I'd rate this place 4.5 if I could.  The staff was great.  The views are amazing, if you get one.  The food is a little better than average.  I was not very impressed with the lobster roll, I think there was too much tarragon or something.  The lobster bisque was pleasant, although they were out of bread and I think it would have been better served with some.  My wife enjoy the BBQ brisket sandwich. The fish and chips were a generous serving.< /Text>

<text>This place has a beautiful view of the bay. I always go on Sunday for brunch. It’s maybe $50 bucks not including tip for a seafood brunch. The seafood options are: cold snow crab, lobster claws, oysters... there is always fried chicken, a brisket, and eggs to order, and unlimited mimosas 🥰</text>< Name>

Went here the other night and was beyond impressed. It has such a great and unique atmosphere. Most times with upscale restaurants like this you are left paying an absurd price for delicious food but incredibly small portions. Tom Ham's is definitely different in this regard, as the portions they give you are plentiful at prices that are absolutely reasonable for how well prepared the food is. I was also blown away by the prices of the cocktails for how good they were. The Bali Hai Mai Tai doesn't disappoint and the other drinks we had were fantastic while not being overpriced in the slightest. Also, contrary to other reviews on here, they do go out of their way to celebrate birthdays and are willing to go the extra mile to make that night special (cake and special seating with a great view for no extra charge). Perhaps this was a reflection of the server we had (who was wonderful), but every employee who we spoke with that night was also incredibly accommodating and friendly, so I don't think it was limited to that individual.

This is definitely one of the best spots in all of San Diego and I will absolutely be coming back for more of that asparagus and more drinks in the future! Can't say enough great things about this place!<//text>

<Review>Beautiful view, came here for happy hour to take advantage of the $1 oysters. They were delicious and the view from the bar is worth the visit. Also tried the calamari which was average for calamari like any place really. The local beers are good to try $3 for 8oz if you wanna just try it! The bartender Joe provided great service and was very pleasant. I enjoyed conversation with him throughout my dinner. Would definitely recommend for people who enjoy good food and the waterfront. Don't come here if you're rushed...this is one of those relax and enjoy type of places, which you should :) I will be having my birthday here and looking forward to trying new things on the menu!</Review>< Pictures>

Nice views, friendly staff. Was not in the mood or right frame of mind for a 54.00 brunch, though it look yummy.
Noisy interior, beyond what I want to tolerate. Perhaps a non brunch day would be different. I will try again.< /text>

<Review>Great view of downtown San Diego and the bay. Overall, dinner was good but unremarkable. Prices are decent. I wasn't a fan of the Caesar salad but I should have asked them to hold the anchovies, which made the salad too salty for me. My husband really liked the asparagus and corn salad. They did a good job on the Brussels sprouts.< /Review>< pics>

We recently had our wedding here on March 30th, 2019. I can only say that the night here at Tom Hams was absolutely perfect and magical. Service was top notch, the view was incredible, and all expectations were exceeded. We will be coming back for dinner on each anniversary. Can't thank you enough Tom Hams Lighthouse for providing the best night of our lives.<//Review>

<Review>They also have lots of great eats for land lovers such as a custom omelet station and custom hand made pasta station.  It's Some of the best freshest pasta I've had in a long time with fresh garlic, spinach, mushrooms, basil, fresh cheese and more garlic. Yum!  Great traditional breakfast items like chilaquiles and eggs Benedict.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80deab0d284064d9:0xba249d609c190abe< /gmap_id><user_id>114453238094354548837</user_id><username>Luz Myers< /username></record>

I went with a couple of friends for restaurant week. We all ordered something different so we could sample a good amount of the items on their pre fixe menu, which is actually quite large. We tried the beer salad, crudo & steak bites all were quite good & good sized portions. For entree's we did the pan seared duck, scallops & the shrimp pasta, again all were really fantastic & good sized portions. The dessert course we had cheese cake, creme brulee & apple crumb cake. Overall I couldn't be happier with this amazing meal. Highly recommended!</text>

Lots of seafood, but all the other items not much difference than other seafood buffet.
Especially for seniors, if you eat small amount, this price is too high, really not worth it.
However if you are willing to pay for ocean view,
sitting outside you can get good views.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>The view and table setup was lovely.  However,  the soup was barely warm.  The rolls were like bricks.  The roasted potatoes were over cooked.  The chicken was very dry but had nice gravy which helped.   The cake was very good but the coffee was not hot.   As this was a large party, I would hope your regular individual meals would meet a higher standard.<//Review><response>None</response><rating>1</rating>< Date>

< review>
The menu reads from another country. What I mean by that is that you have to look up the description of there foods. I can't say how good their food was because I was too scared to order off the menu. It was all weird food. I ended up getting the Shrimp Cocktail and a bowl of their corn chowder to be safe. My Mom got a small house salad a the corn chowder. I can't remember what my husband go, but I know it was something he didn't care for.<//review>

Recently hosted a luncheon there for about 30 people and reserved the upstairs private room.  Luz, our coordinator, took care of everything and everything was perfect - right down to our custom signage downstairs and personalized menus, neither of which were expected.  Our servers Sarah and Molly were on top of everything and helped us with some last minute changes (vases for flowers we brought, etc.) and volunteered to take our picture at the end in a beautiful spot with a perfect view.  The food all came out quickly and all at once and was all delicious.
I have been going to Tom Ham's Lighthouse for years and will now certainly keep them in mind for any event I need to host.
Oh .. and not to mention, I came in well under budget for my event.  5 stars for the whole encounter !!</Text>

<review>Nice views..Pretty good food..Not a lot of choices, but if you're into seafood their raw bar is where it's at...Crab legs/claws, oysters, steamed scallops, Shrimp and more..Definitely pricey!!!..and quite crowded to boot..Our server Raymond, was on the other hand, fantastic and kept the champagne flowing as well as being very attentive to our needs. Frankly speaking he was the best part of the brunch besides the views..Would I go back again..Yes, however only if someone else was paying..<//review>< Pictures>

The food in general is good with the exception of the sirloin. Try not to order the sirloin as it is poorly cooked and the quality is very disappointing.Their fries are very good and unique . A bit sourness accompanied by parmesan cheese. So ordering seafood is safe, beef? Hell to the no.</Text>

Service was good and the view of SanDiego is amazing. The vegetables were very well done but the vinaigrette was tasteless oil and my salmon had no flavor. We've eaten here before and enjoyed it, but this time it was lacking.< /Text>

Whenever I'm in San Diego, this is a guaranteed pleasant experience.  Great view,   food is always well-prepared and well-presented by a knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Over my forty plus years of dining there I have never been dissatisfied.

Last year we had a commitment ceremony in their dramatic venue and guest dining in a private room.  Every aspect was carefully planned and executed.<//Text>

<username>Bradley Zefkeles< /username><review>The light house is fantastic. I would have given it 5 stars except for the long walk for a handicapped mother in law. I didn't see an accessible to use to drop her off near the entrance.  The amazing views and the historic light house made up for the slight discomfort though.< /review>< resp>

It sits across the street from the water and has fantastic views from the second floor. The food was chosen for the luncheon so I can’t comment much on their menu but what we had for the luncheon was pretty good and the portions were big.< /text>< Pictures>

Great spot, really nice wait staff, fantastic drinks and their happy hour menu is QUALITY. Only downside was the staff didn't communicate well. It was my in-laws 50th anniversary and I wanted to surprise them by having champagne and oysters delivered to the table the second they sat down (so they didn't need to order until they were thinking about their second round). Instead two different people came to check if they thought about their order yet and said "the oysters and champagne are on the way". 🙄<//text>

First time san diego and decided to go all out and try great food. First thing that popped up on google was this place. Great and delicious food. Reasonable prices and the servers were very friendly. Atmosphere is great. Eating on the ocean and watch sailboats? What more can you ask for. I plan to go back.<//review>

Our party of 5 had great service, with no issues getting separate checks.
The view of the bay is beautiful & perfect for picture taking.
Everyone loved their food, which included shrimp ceviche, drummettes, & clam chowder. My tenderloin tips with fresh vegetables was delicious! The meat was flavorful & the veggies crisp. I definitely recommend The Lighthouse.<//Review>

<rating>2<//rating><text>Great food & good service. Very noisy until a loud group left. After that it was just tolerable. Not sure how to get a place for 4 on the patio. We asked for the patio at the time of reservation & were told that's "first come basis". When we arrived 15 minutes early they said, the patio was reserved. We then got seated indoors, far removed from the patio, yet there were 2 tables available & a third was being cleared. When I told my 3 guests that wasn't right, they said  this was OK, & let's eat.< /text><Date>1545007943315< /Date><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80deab0d284064d9:0xba249d609c190abe< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

Lunch Review: Location can't be beat, bar faces the city so you have great views of the San Diego bay. Food is good, maybe a tad bit more expensive than other restaurants in San Diego but you're paying for the view. I'd give the food 4 stars, really good. Service was better than par. I'd go back!</Text>

<Review>The service was great, our waitress gave us great inputs and recommendations. The drinks were great I enjoyed my cocktail I ordered the "Saucy Sally", and my wife enjoyed the "tiny bubbles." As for the food I am beyond disappointed I ordered the Bouillabaisse and it was gross! The saffron broth had no flavor  and hit had the consistency of Campbell's soup. As a matter of fact it most likely came out of a can. All the seafood in the dish were drowned in the broth it was a complete disaster. My wife ordered the "Paella" the rice was greasy and flavorless. The peppers tasted raw instead of sautéed. This dish had so much potential but was a complete let down. I truly love food, and I will never come back to this establishment. I hope your experience is better than mine.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

This was my first visit to Tom Ham's Lighthouse.  We had an office Christmas get-together in the bar area with 20 people.  The views across the harbor of downtown San Diego were gorgeous!  We had small bites off the Happy Hour menu.  Everything was delicious.  The wait staff were prompt and helpful, and courteous.  Full bar, wine, non-alcoholic beverages.  We really enjoyed it.<//Text>

The location and ambiance are great. A smaller balcony area with heating elements makes it pleasant to sit outside most parts of the year. A great variety of seafood dishes elegantly prepared are available. The view is enjoyable to overlook the bay and the downtown skyline. We enjoyed the callimari and cauliflower appetizers and then our table had the scallops, salmon and vegetarian dinners and we ended with creme brulee and cheesecake. My favorites from the night were the cauliflower appetizer and the creme brulee. Enjoyable night.</Review>

The flavor was amazing and it tasted so clean! The burger tasted like a steak cooked to perfection! The cinnamon apple crumb cake... I will never come here again without ordering it!! It was so warm and perfect!! The best part about it all, they don’t skimp on portions, every course there was enough to share! The kids meal was huge for a kids meal, and very good. Quality food!!

I came here to indulge in the 3-course special during restaurant week.  A really good deal for only $35! The restaurant is in a great location on Harbor Island, with beautiful views of the downtown skyline just right across the bay.  We grabbed some outside seating so we can enjoy the view while the sunset reflecting beautifully from the buildings of the skyline. So pretty!! :)

The service was great.  The hosts were nice but our server was even sweeter.  He was very informative about their specials and raw bar menu.  For appetizers, my friend and I got calamari and mussels and both were delicious! For the main course, I enjoyed the clam linguine and my friend got the paella which she enjoyed just as much.  The desserts were a little tiny, but they were both really delicious and the perfect amount of sweetness.  I will consider going again :)  It was a great place for seafood.</review>

<Text>Seared duck was amazing, beef tenderloin equally great. The lobster bisque was slightly salty and had no actual lobster chunks in it. Calamari was delicious alone but the sauce given with it was crazy hot. Everyone around us got complimentary bread but we had to ask for it. Views of San Diego bay were breath taking.<//Text><response>None<//response><Time>1517114941791<//Time></record>

<review>Hadn't been here since they remodeled. Awesome view. Kind of a mixed review on the menu...$42 for New York steak--sounded a little pricey, but OK, sounds yummy...comes out all cut into pieces with gravy poured all over it. Looked like a can of Alpo dog food, tasted OK, but come on, when you order a steak off a menu, I expect a steak, especially for that price with no sides. Sea food entrees were reasonable and well prepared. You ran out of bread at 7:30 on a Saturday night???Really?? With a party of 5, would have been nice to get a refill on the bread basket. Overall, an OK experience that could have been better< /review>< Pics>

One of my favorite restaurants in San Diego. Great food and peaceful, relaxing atmosphere with harbor and city skyline view. Sometimes we just get wine and appetizers or dessert, but last night we did apps, entrees and dessert!  We love Ally too!<//text>

Most restaurants are so noisy & packed it’s impossible to hear, so we were pleasantly surprised even though it was busy we could enjoy the views, excellent food...and not have to yell!

Scallops and duck breast were the best. Paella was not traditional. Creme brulee was a bit more eggy than custard-y. Apple crumb was possibly overbaked. It was so hard. Service was amazing. It was like he could read our minds.<//review>

<review>Absolutely beautiful view and location. Incredible to see and wander around when you visit. Drinks and drink selection are very good if appropriately expensive given location. Service ws prompt and polite, very helpful. Unfortunately food was disappointing. I had a lobster roll that was bland and tasteless. Fish and chips as the same issue. The chicken salad had more flavor and thus was more enjoyable. Go for the view, the atmosphere, and the drinks. For the food, it's nothing special.</review><response>None</response><Rating>3<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

What you pay for is 40% food and 60% view (in my opinion, don't hurt me)
the food did not capture me for the price i paid for the brunch, but my goodness the view made the food taste that much better<//review>

I usually don't write reviews for places but I just had the BEST dinner! The service was so, so, so, SO great and friendly and attentive. They also were happy to help with my indecisiveness and answer the several questions I had-this was my first time here. The food was just AMAZING! I had the raw bay scallops (which if you get, eat it with all 3 toppings plus the lemon, you will thank me), and the whole fish which was New Zealand snapper. Top. Notch. Sea food. Try this place, I'm serious it was great you won't be disappointed. Though bring a light jacket, it's a bit cool inside.</Review>

<Review>Staff, service, ambience, sunset view were all great! Most of our food however, was bland and boring. The drinks were okay, but nothing special. The tomato ?fennel? soup was quite good :). Steak tips, and the whole market fish were very bland, they need flavor. Oysters were good and only $1 each during happy hour.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

As usual this place it’s great! The views are phenomenal, this time we only went to the bar for a drink, hubby had the famous mai tai, it’s incredibly strong, not good in our opinion, but they tell you it is, so no complains there. My margarita was good! Great atmosphere.< /review>

<Review>Unforgettable venue for both wedding and reception. Breathtaking view of San Diego Harbor and skyline makes for a lovely backdrop for wedding photos. The staff is so helpful, especially Brooke, who helped us coordinate the events of our wedding. Proud to say that Tom Ham's is LGBT-friendly, and my wife and I could not be happier with choosing this location for our special day. Food is excellent and reasonably priced. Full bar. Parking is free, and the lot is fairly large. A beautiful place to enjoy a meal in San Diego for both tourists and locals alike.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80deab0d284064d9:0xba249d609c190abe< /Gmap_id>< Rate>

The occasion and service were great! Given, it was a banquet, the bread was excellent, and created an expectation, the salad was good, the main course  was salmon (good), orzo (tasted like chicken bouillon) and pretty but bland overcooked veggies. The desert (which is usually hard to resist) was left on  most plates at my table hardly touched (achingly sweet). I wouldn't come back for the food.<//Review>

We had a funeral at Fort Rosecrans National cemetery and had a luncheon for the attendees. 16 people in a private room. I can not say enough for the quality of service, food and a very very reasonable price. The staff at Tom Ham went out of their way to make us feel welcome and well taken care of. Luz and her crew did an outstanding job.< /Text>

They remodeled Tom Ham's Lighthouse and it is pretty darn cool. Beautifully done and great staff.  The fish of the day was just ok so it got 4 stars. But the view is awsome and worth it</text>

The view from this place is worth the price of admission alone. The food was good and the staff was friendly. If you have the opportunity to give this place a try I would take it.</Text>

<text>Sad to see a place like this serve food that feels like it was popular in the 70's. Very heavy, not very tasty.  Service was great, though and the bar seemed to be the place everyone was coming to. Their drinks must be good!< /text>< name>

We went for brunch and the service was awesome. Our champagne glasses we're never empty. They have a wonderful variety of brunch items to chose from. I was a little disappointed in the seafood- they have a ton of it but didn't taste the best so I had seconds on dessert instead.</review>

Plenty of free parking. Enjoyed our Holiday Luncheon in the California Room. Weather was great, so view from indoors and outdoors were wonderful! Buffet lunch was excellent...Caesar salad, beef brisket, chicken, salmon, roasted vegetables, rolls, iced tea, coffee, no hot bar. Serving staff was very accommodating.<//review>

Great food, amazing views, however the service was a bit slow due.  This is a cute restaurant where the entire east side of the restaurant is windows facing the San Diego City skyline.  The view is breathtaking.  My husband took me here for date night and I was very impressed.  I would recommend.< /Review>

<text>Beautiful views, great service. I had the salmon, which was delicious. My husband had the paella and said it was "good". I asked the server if it compared to the real deal (paella I've had in Spain), and he said some people say it's better. I thought it was also good, but not the best I've had. I would come here again! To me, prices were a little high, but I suppose you're paying for the location and whole dining experience.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

This place is amazing. The view can't be beat and it is tucked in behind some marinas in a very quiet area. The food is pricey, but good. The fish and chips were super generous portions and 3 of us shared 2 servings. My husband had the lobster po' boy and it looked really good.</Review>

<review>I've been to this place for a couple weddings this year and it's such a great spot. Other than the weddings, I've been here for their Sunday brunch and it's a great deal. The seafood is fresh and there's a lot of variety for other food. Try to get a window table for amazing views of the water. The place has been renovated within the past year and feels more up-to-date than before.< /review>< pictures>

We were invited to a surprise party here and had a wonderful time. Our lobster rolls were delicious (although they are not Maine-style lobster rolls - according to my hubby from Maine).  The setting is beautiful and the views on the harbor and bay are spectacular. Service was excellent.</review>

<user_name>Brittley Walla</user_name><text>Tom Ham's is hands down my favorite restaurant in San Diego! You can't be the view of the bay and downtown San Diego from Harbor Island. Their food is amazing and their attention to detail is on point. Whether you get a table inside or out on the balcony, they make sure that everyone gets a view. The restaurant is inside an updated light house.</text><Rating>5</Rating>< UserId.>

Gorgeous view of the city and San Diego Bay. Upscale dining with a great menu and knowledgeable staff. Indoor and outdoor seating available with a large parking lot. Would suggest reservations during summer months.< /Text>

Came down to SD from SF for Fri., Sat.,Sun., Giants and Padres series. Subjected to "Torture". The one shining light was having a light dinner of small plates at "Tom Hams Lighthouse". Had  a chopped Caesars salad and a different way of eating chicken wings.  Must have their chicken lollipops. Ate in the bar where the bar tenderess, Stacy, took good care of me! Three great margaritas!</Review>

I really enjoy DJing weddings at Tom Ham's Lighthouse! All the staff is very courteous and easy to work with which creates a upbeat atmosphere. The ceremony area, patio, Harbor View Room, and California Room are all beautiful. The view of the San Diego skyline is stunning and is one of the best in the city. I highly recommend you check it out for a great waterfront location.< /Review>

We had my birthday brunch at Tom Ham's Lighthouse. The seafood bar is just amazing. All the crab and shrimp and lobster you can eat! I really enjoyed our view out to San Diego Bay - such a variety of boats went by during our meal. The service at Tom Ham's is particularly attentive. We felt like we had our own personal waitress. She anticipated our every wish.</review>

<GmapID>0x80deab0d284064d9:0xba249d609c190abe</GmapID><text>3 star is only for the view the restaurant offers. Most of the menu is seafood, most of which I couldn't eat. But that's not the reason I'm rating low, the reason is the food is not that fresh and menu options are scarce, plus the menu booklet was crumpled and with oil stains.  With better menu options and more neatness this place would've been very popular. The restaurant has free parking for guests which is great.<//text>< username>

Do not come here for food. The view is nice but the food was bland. I got lobster bisque that had absolutely no lobster in it and tasted like cheese. We also ordered fish and chips and crab BLT both had no flavor at all. A pint of ballast point which is brewed right down the street cost $7-9. I can literally go to the brewery and get is for half that.<//Review>

We went for the brunch buffet. The food was great, lobster claws were awesome and the endless champagne was hell yes. Make sure to create a reservation because waiting sucks and you will wait a good amount here.< /text>

Waterfront restaurant with magnificent views. I can imagine this would be a great place for a wedding or other big event. Waitstaff was friendly, if a bit on the slow side. We waited forever for our desserts and coffee, as well as the bill.Prices are what you would expect to pay at a semi-fancy waterfront restaurant in San Diego. If you want a burger for dinner, you will want to look somewhere else!
We were a party of 8 so there was a lot of different dishes ordered. Calamari and a platter of muscles was devoured quickly for starters.Two people had the Kobe steak which was good, but I have definitely had a much better steak at numerous (and less expensive) restaurants. Another had the Prime NY and it was tasty, if a bit on the small size for the price. The yellow tail and pan seared salmon were enjoyable and well seasoned. The bouillabaisse was a hit, as was the paella.
Key lime pie and a couple of hard rootbeer floats finished things off in a tasty and sweet way. The fact that anyone had room for dessert (very unusual for this group!) may give you an idea of the portion sizes of the dinner selections.
All in all I would say it was good. Expensive, but good. The real star of the night was the view, which was fantastic. So if you are looking for atmosphere to be the star, this is a good choice. If you want the food to be the main attraction, you can probably find better, and at a lower price point.< /text>

Randomly picked this place because of the reviews and we loved what we found. The view from the brunch was absolutely beautiful with plenty of selections to choose from. The only problem is that I couldn't eat more than I had! I would recommend this place for the view alone, but the food is great as well!</review>

Tom Ham’s Lighthouse is on my top three favorite restaurants list. On the heated deck or inside the atmosphere is peaceful, the menu is outstanding, the service is professional, and it has one of the best views of San Diego!
Cloth-covered tables and calm atmosphere add to the pleasure and the price, but there are ways to enjoy an affordable meal in an exquisite setting, and it’s perfect for the special occasion splurge.
Locals or visitors should check it out, just leave me a table now that you know it’s here!<//Review>

<text>Tom Ham's Lighthouse is one of those places to take your whole family. Their service is great for such a large space, even when it's packed. Their view of the Pacific is an incredible sight after spending a lot of time away from the coast. The location takes your breath away. There's nothing like it in the afternoon. As for their food and drinks, their mussels were fantastic. If Frank Sinatra was still alive, this would probably be on his list of San Diego spots.<//text>< gmap_id>

Not impressed with this place. The service was poor and the food was good, but did not live up to the prices they charge. Reservations and we still waited a while to be seated. At least we were entertained at the bar, which the service was slow at as well. All of the little bugs flying around pretty much ruined what might have just been a good dinner. Seriously, that was getting annoying.<//Text>

< Review>
Came here for mother's day and my birthday. Made reservations for Saturday morning at 11:45. Honestly wasnt impressed. Sever recommended the claim chowder only to bring us tomatoe bisque and was confused when we said we wanted the chowder and not the bisque. He than checked and informed us they didnt have the chowder. Our fish and chips was undercooked and soggy and the grilled asparagus and corn salad was literally a bowl of corn and taro chips with no greens besides the asparagus. Overall a pretty disappointing experience. Wouldn't recommend. Server was too busy to be consider with us.< /Review>

Along the water so on the warmer nights it doesn't get too hot and the bar upstairs has some amazing quick bites and drinks.

I did not have a wedding planner and did it all on my own but if it wasn't for Perla and Brook this whole process wouldn't have been as smooth. They went above and beyond to make our day a special one. They were professional, knowledgeable and great communicators. I honestly couldn't have dreamed for a better wedding. Thank you everyone at Tom Ham's!!</review>< pics>

We were separated by some  bushes. All you could hear was their DJ bumping. I understand they have other guest's but this was ridiculously unprofessional, especially for someone's wedding. How many times does the clergy person have to repeat himself until enough is enough? Do you... Do you... Do you... I'd hate to see that wedding video. I definitely wouldn't recommend having a wedding service at this establishment. Plus, the food was rough. Raw steak anyone?<//review>< Rating>

<Review>The food was good. The atmosphere, decor, and views are beautiful.  Server was friendly and knowlegeable, however we were very disappointed with manager.  We left a gift card at home by accident and we asked if we could call someone at the house so the waitress can punch in the number off the card. They said no and I had to ask my mother in law to come drive 20 miles to drop it off.  We also asked if we brought the gift card in another day could they credit us and they said no.< /Review>< Response>

First time visiting this restaurant. We were looking forward to having some great seafood upon recommendation however were quite disappointed.  I had the bouillabaisse. The mussels tasted old, the lobster was overcooked, and the broth was bland.  The garlic toasts were also burned on the edges and was ruined with a cold red pepper spread.  My husband was very disappointed in the sea scallops, as they were also overcooked.   The cocktails, salad, clam chowder, and sourdough bread were great,  wish we had stopped there and called it a day.<//text>

The redesigned space transports the diner through the restaurant's history as you enter the first floor lobby then up the open spiral staircase to the main dining room. Staff are attentive and professional. The view is amazing from ANY table in the restaurant due to the tiered seating and levels of dining. The menu was spot on, fresh seafood focused. Though I went for the California organic grass fed steak cooked to perfection! Beer selection is out of sight, well tailored to the SD beer scene. The wine list was well stocked too. I'm going back!< /review>

The service was amazing. I had a party for my mom this past weekend. They made sure she felt special along with each of my guest. They were so attentive. I would definitely recommend other's to have a party there.<//Review>

I haven't been here for a while now, but I felt this place was worth leaving a good review.

There are very few places in San Diego that have a spectacular view like Tom Ham's Lighthouse. I used to come here more often.

You can sit outside on the balcony and have your dinner. Look at the menu online to get an idea of what they serve. I have never had anything here that wasn't good. HOWEVER, the last time I came (right after the remodel), the portions got smaller. I'm 6'1" tall and I had to order extra bread so I wouldn't leave the place hungry. The food is always great. I hate when I go to expensive restaurants and they server food I could make at home. This is not the case here.

Tom Ham's Lighthouse has started embracing the San Diego Micro Brew scene. You don't have to spend a lot of money to have a good time here. The bar itself is awesome to go to with your buddy. Bring a date, you can't go wrong.

I recommend the swordfish plate.</Text>

We went with a big crowd recently and the service was amazing! They kept returning to refill our drinks and take our old plates. The service was out of this world. And the view? Oh it was heavenly. I wish i took a picture,  maybe next time. The food was delicious. I was really excited about the ayce oysters but I'm assuming they weren't shelled correctly so they had a lot of shell casings in them when you would eat but there was a ton of other food options that it didn't hinder us at all. The eggs benedict were fantastic. My cousin doesn't like runny eggs but he went back and got 3 because of how delicious they were! Will definitely come back!<//text>

I love the weekend brunch here (it's a bit pricey but it's worth it).  You get breakfast (check out the omelet station, of course there's bacon), roast beef carving station, crab legs, shrimp cocktail, and champagne.  I highly recommend making a reservation.

This place is great for special occasions and get together.</text>

Came here during happy hour during my vacation. It was our last day in San Diego and oh my, was it gorgeous! We sat in the patio. When it got cold, the beaters turned on.

We had two dozen oysters along with a bunch of their apps. IIRC, I enjoyed the first batch of oysters and the mac and cheese. We did have a couple pieces of oysters that had a foul taste..<//Review>

Horrible service, place was empty they said they take walk-ins but it would be about a 40 min wait time.  I was the only person waiting to be seated place was empty. I went on a Monday night, i don't mind waiting for a table but the attitude and energy of place was horrible. I left this place and went over to THE FISH MARKET. that place is awesome, everyone in town was there i was a walk in took about 10 min to get a table and the food was AWESOME!!! so was the SERVICE!!!  hands down the place to eat seafood when in San Diego. oh and GREAT VIEWS.</Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Sunday Brunch overlooking San Diego Bay! The brunch was good with a nice selection of seafood.  Crab legs, oysters on the half shell, shrimp cocktail were plentiful.  Basic breakfast items and a salad bar spread.  Made to order pasta bar and omelets too.
Champaign and juices were included in the price of the brunch.  There was a full bar available if you wanted a special drink.
The price was a bit high but it was worth it.  Don't forget to try some of the deserts.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<time>1478537136208<//time><text>Here is a good example of a restaurant that remains in business just because of its location.
We took our friends for dinner to celebrate their wedding and out of a few choices, the bride picked Tom Ham's for the views hoping that the food would be good as well. To our disappointment it didn't live up to the hype of people's ratings and was in fact quite a letdown on most items.
Some of the starters were acceptable but not by far on the culinary level that their prices would suggest. ALL of the main courses were below average and the desserts were simply a slap in the face. Just as an example, the 'deconstructed" key lime pie had the texture of warmed up latex and was served with a side of bright green goo, that not only resembled but tasted like it was made by Monsanto. Another dessert - the whiskey cake (also deconstructed) honestly reminded me of Von's cake from a box that spent a few days in a refrigerator and was revived by microwave to be served to us, likewise with a side of their signature goo, this time in purple.
Bottom line, if you want to enjoy the view just get a bottle of wine with some snacks and save your money for a restaurant where they can actually cook food.</text>< Gmap_id>

Excellent service with a very friendly waiter who engaged in conversation when speaking with him. Very good food, as is hopefully expected at this price point. Probably one of the best views of the harbor as well as the downtown san diego skyline. Highly recommended.< /text>

Their services are great but can be a little slow on busy day.  I tried their scallop - just perfectly cooked.< /review>< gmap_id>

You will pay more to eat here,  but the food is fresh and what should be cold is cold, and what should be warm is warm. It is well run and organized and they control the numbers to provide a relaxing dining experience.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>My husband and I was staying in the area attending a conference and we needed something in walking distance.  The scallions were the best I had in years.  The brick chicken was delicious and juicy and the view was to die for.  I wish I would have eat here the next night but we decided to try other restaurants in the area.  What a disappointment, the other two restaurant one that starts with Island and the Mexican restaurant next to it were awful.< /text>< Date>

<Review>We went yesterday for their Sunday brunch. It was my birthday, so I hoped to have a nice experience. It started out fine with the hostesses recognizing my birthday, we didn't have to wait (since we had reservations) and were given a table outside with a fabulous view. I have a feeling that they failed to tell our server about my birthday, because he didn't say or do anything.
Service: Our server didn't seem to want to wait on our table. There were only two of us at the table, so it's not like it was a large party.  He said he'd bring water, but we had to ask twice. He said he'd bring more sparkling wine, but we had to remind him. He didn't bring a bowl for the seafood shells, though all the tables around us had one. He let all the dishes pile up on the table, so I asked a hostess to have a busser come to the table (though nobody did). I finally had to ask the waiter to clear the table for us. He brought a birthday dessert to the table next to us, but didn't do the same for me. I saw multiple bussers out on the deck helping out, but they would keep passing our table. Instead of waiting on our table, our server was busy taking cell phone pictures for all the other guests, or talking with co-workers. He never asked if we wanted coffee when he saw us eating dessert. He only came back to the table to let us know it was "last call" and drop off the check.
Food: There were only a few lobster claws hidden beneath lots of stone crab claws. The two pieces of lobster were good, but the stone crab seemed off (shredded meat inside with zero flavor). There was a pasta station set up. I asked the guy what kind of pasta it was, and he said there wasn't any pasta. I assumed they ran out, but he gave no explanation. Of course when we were leaving the restaurant, I saw him cooking pasta for someone. The short ribs were greasy. I only saw blue cheese, not a platter with lots of options. There was a sign for whipped cream cheese to go with the desserts, but there was no whipped cream. The smoked salmon was good. The ricotta pancakes were delicious.
I realize that this place is a local institution with a fantastic reputation. The view and weather were great. I've been to tons of local buffets, casinos, hotels, resorts, Vegas, etc. This was such a bummer. Especially, on my birthday. It's possible our server was having a bad day, but I shouldn't have to make excuses for that. We felt ignored, were extremely disappointed, and won't be back. The server makes or breaks your experience. I assumed the tip was included in the check, and that's why he made no effort. But, thankfully it wasn't. Gratuity should not be taken for granted, or expected if all you do is pour a glass of wine and bring the check. There are hundreds of restaurants in San Diego to choose from. When you are paying $50 for brunch, you expect great service.
PS - I just saw another review for the same day we went. He only gave 2 stars also. Maybe we had the same server.< /Review>< Pics>

Came for Wednesday night lobster special.  Not disappointed.  Too bad we're squeezed to a smaller table so not having sufficient space but lobster, bread, dessert and service all good.  Too bad it is 120 miles from Orange County.<//text>

Horrific in all aspects. Food was terrible, scallops overcooked on one side yet raw on the other. Top sirloin was just 2 slices of bad pot roast made to look like a steak and the service was non existing. This used to be a go to spot with customers and out of town family but wouldn't step back in there again.<//review>

Always love this restaurant.  Their brunch is outrageous.  The only thing that is better than their brunch is their view of downtown.< /review>

Went there with our girlfriend for relationship anniversary dinner.

The place is beautiful and the view is wonderful! I highly recommand dining on the patio if you can, worth it and we were not cold. It was also very easy to park during week day.

The food was great. Maybe the soup was a bit salty to be a bit picky, but we were both really happy with what we ordered. The portion were also definitely enough and we had a hard time finishing!

Our waiter was delivering perfect service and was very nice. We were also offered a small chocolate cake as desert for our anniversary, really appreciated the attention!

Will defnitely come back and highly recommand :)</review>

No matter where you sit you get a beautiful view of San Diego skyline across the harbor. A bit noisy with loud diners laughing. Big echoing dining room. But food and service good.<//Review>

Best view of San Diego!  Nice mixed drinks, local craft brews, and local/fresh menu! Great place to take out-of-town friends for a first introduction to San Diego.<//review>

Ok at best. When I see reviews and people say top notch food... Makes me think they don't get out much. Food is ok. Drinks are ok and service is fine. Price is for the view. Clean restaurant. But very basic.</Review>

Can't miss their Sunday brunch! Seafood buffet is the best! Why pay $$$ for two or three oysters when you can come here and eat as many as you can?!<//review>

Just reopened two weeks ago after remodeling. Beautiful! The paella was delicious, as were the pomegranate glazed pork belly & the shrimp & corn chowder.  Veru good service.</review>

<Text>Happy hour- $1 oysters and $5 pints on selected beers. Good views of the harbor. Came for restaurant week- appetizers: mussels were good, came with a lot and the broth with chorizo was good. My friend got lobster bisque and it was salty. Entrees- I got the scallops, it wasn’t jumbo but decent size and it was good. The paella was pretty good too. Dessert- blackberry panna cotta was just okay, it was too hard, and wasn’t that great. Overall it was good place with a great view!</Text>< Pictures>

My friend and I came for lunch during Restaurant Week. It was first time and I enjoyed the charm of the building and the beautiful surroundings. It was a $15 lunch menu which included 2 choices of 3 courses. I chose the ceviche and the lobster roll.

The ceviche, while tasty, was different than others I had. It had kind of a gelatinous sauce that put me off at first, but tasted just fine. The lobster roll was a generous serving of two mini rolls stuffed full with lobster and a side of skinny fries.

We both ordered sangria ($10 each) and it was the perfect Friday afternoon meal. Our service was great. Our server answered several questions we had about the menu. I loved all the seafood choices and the view is definitely impressive.</Text><rate>5</rate>< Date>

<Review>Their new outdoor patio makes a huge difference! It was an amazing view sitting outside looking at Coronado and downtown.

The food was very good but a little overpriced, hence the 4 stars.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80deab0d284064d9:0xba249d609c190abe<//Gmap_id></record>

This place is fantastic. Great views, great food at good prices, good happy hour, and amazing restaurant week deals. We also had our wedding here and everything was amazing for a very reasonable price.  We haven't been disappointed by anything yet.</review>

<review>Pricey.  Google has it as $$, but I think the dishes are $$$ or $$$$.  Unfortunately, the quality is not up to snuff.  We ordered salmon, scallops, and the bouillabaisse.  The bouillabaisse was not hot when it was served (scary, for seafood), it was not in a broth, and there was no andouille sausage -- $32.  Four scallops for $34, also not served hot -- nothing to write home about.  The salmon looked good, but was kind of bland -- $34.  The bread tasted and had the texture of day-old bread.  This not what one has become accustomed to in the downtown area, even in restaurants that charge less.  Dropping $108 dollars on a meal like that was very disappointing.< /review>< Date>

Brunch. It's all about the Sunday Brunch.
Crab, oysters, shrimp, lobster and a great assortment of other delicious items plus free flowing champagne. My favorite place on Sunday....when football isn't in season.< /Review>

The staff is friendly and the food here is delicious, just be aware that it is on the expensive side (entrees go for $35+). Also a great place to take a little walk with a scenic view afterward.< /Text></record>

<review>This place is a gem!  I was recently here for a conference meeting but have been here many times for dinner.  If you're a local, you owe it to yourself to eat here, not just for the beautiful scenery but the good food.<//review>< pics>

This used to be a great place to go, but it's lost it's edge.  Not sure why/how, but while the food is very good, and they do a fair job at service, the prices relate to the expectations.  At these prices, I would really expect much better service, and less like service and atmosphere at a high end Red Lobster.<//review>

Food was amazing, views were amazing, only reason for 4 stars is service. My wife and I traveled from the other side of the country and booked days ahead for my 30th birthday dinner. First drink took 20 minutes+, courses were only 5 minutes spaced apart and felt rushed, and server was not told that it was a birthday so we had to awkwardly ask if a dessert could be taken off our bill at the end as promised when we made reservations. Definitely not the treatment expected for a $200+ 30th birthday dinner for two.<//review>

WOW!  Awesome views and amazing happy hour weekdays from 3 to 6 (buck a shuck oysters and other amazing food offerings and craft beers).  We enjoyed the oysters so much we had 4 dozen between 2 of us.  And the calamari, a REAL Caesar Salad with Spanish anchovies and steak tips with polenta and a veal demi glaae were just to die for!< /Text>

Best brunch hands down.  If you want to impress visitors (i.e., parents) bring them here.  It not only has a great view of the bar and city skyline but the quality of food here is superb. Plus for $42 a person not that bad for the fanciness.

To be clear, it's $42 a person with unlimited everything including champagne, coffee, drinks, etc. You get scallops, mussels, snow crabs, and lobster claws, which are all pretty big and fat. They also have an omelet station, bacon, sausage, eggs benedict, waffles, pancakes, french toast, short ribs, pasta, and prime rib. Plus a station of all sorts of desserts. But I stuck with the seafood station for my first five plates.  They were just addicting. Favorite was the lobster claws. Easy to de-shell and delicious with dipper hot butter.

Staff are friendly and they are on top of making sure your drinks are filled, plates and buckets cleared, and napkins changed.

Tips: Make a reservation and either request a booth inside or seating on the patio for an even better view.</review>

We celebrated a friends 90th Birthday on this dining experience!  We were pleased with everything the restaurant offered, from timely seating, reservation accommodations, our beautiful water-front seating!!, menue choices, the hostess, and our very friendly and attentive waiter!  The appetizers were amazing, the beer/cocktail selection was excellent, and our food was very good!  I am a very tough critic when it comes to food so if I were to critique anything on the cuisine I would say that the fish (I and my niece had the Market Fish, I believe was a Barramundi) was a bit over done and the falafel on the Vegetarian Dinner was a bit over fried and heavy, but aside from these issues both entrees were delish!
For starters, we had the calamari which was cooked perfectly and accompanied by a Honey Chili Lime Sauce to die for!  We also shared the mixed beet and greens also spot on-delish and Spanish Octopus with corn 3 ways, AMAZING! another noteworthy entree at our table was the Bouillabaisse, which I am looking forward to trying on my next visit!</Text>

<Text>My wife and I went to Tom Ham's for our 25th anniversary. We wanted spectacular views and fantastic food, and we were well pleased. I started with the calamari (my standard) and it was delicious, not greasy though the sauce could have had more kick and zing for my taste. No biggie. My wife had the bluefin crudo, caught by the chef himself, so said the waiter. It was delicious, especially with the citrus bits. I had the diver scallops for the entree - beautifully cooked and super delicious. The melted leeks, crispy artichokes, Guajillo Grits, and Andouille Sausage all made for the perfect meal. My wife had the pan seared duck breast and it was to die for. It could have been rendered more, the skin more crispy, but omg it was delicious.

Now here's a funny thing. When we arrived we were wished happy anniversary, but apparently no one told our waiter. This wasn't a problem because he was super nice as it was and mentioning anything to him would have resulted in a free dessert like the folks behind us got, and we weren't there for a free dessert. I just am puzzled as to why the waiter wasn't told.

What's important is our overall experience, and we are still talking about the food. This was our third visit to San Diego, and first to Tom Ham's. Next time we go San Diego, we'll be going to Tom Ham's again, for sure!<//Text>< pics>

I really like Tom Hamm's. We have our boat on Harbor Island so when I'm working down at the office aka the boat, lunches at Tom Hamm's are a must. Being a sailor, I really like that its an actual lighthouse, and the interior is decorated with old charts of the bay. You can really see what's changed over the years.

There's an impressive tap list, most all of which can be ordered in 4, 8, or 16 ounce pours.

The bartenders are also top notch. They really seem to care about what goes into the cocktails they're serving. The day shift often shows off what really goes into the later night's libations. You might even learn something.

The only spot Tom's falls down for me, especially for lunch, is a few of the dishes. The menu is a little small and a little expensive for the average daily lunch. But that's okay. The civiche is awesome, the steak frites are great, and the burgers are enormous. The burgers are probably a bit too big for me really.

One thing I will note, especially on the food, is when we had our rehearsal dinner, the food was amazing. All prefix menu options that don't show up on their regular menu as far as I'm aware. I had the swordfish which was spectacular.< /text>

The dining experience  in San Diego is complex and fraught with peril from the tourist traps in the Gaslamp to the joints in the East Village that put so much effort into being edgy and hip that they forget to produce great food.  In this culinary minefield is so refreshing to find a restaurant that has been a San Diego staple for many many years managing to delight the tastebuds and excite the senses.  We started with the chef's-choice dozen oysters which were extremely fresh and delightful.  I had a glass of wine while my beautiful wife tried the Sultry Sally cocktail which she thoroughly enjoyed.  The raw menu is not extensive but if our oysters were indicative it is fresh and well selected.  Moving on to some fried oysters we were astounded by the perfect counterpoint supplied by a dish of Asian inspired pickled vegetables.  My Shrimp and Grits was flavorful with fresh shrimp and nicely prepared grits and a little Andouille sausage to make it interesting.  My wife opted for the Whole Roasted Fish, sea bass. on the night we were there, perfectly roasted, presented with roasted peppers and a wonderful olive tapenade.  One of the best fish dishes I have ever eaten.  I finished off with the key lime pie  while my wife siped her second Sultry Sally.  The pie was more than the sum of its parts with the lime meringue providing a nice variation in sweetness while the sorbet broadened the palate of  tastes, temperatures and textures.  Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not mention our server, Jordan (the name is a coincidence), she did a great job looking after us and graciously listened to our endless prattle.  ONE OF THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCES WE HAVE HAD IN A VERY LONG TIME.<//text>

< Review>
This review is for their wedding services :
I had my magical and amazing wedding at Tom ham's lighthouse.
1) This places is has the amazing view of the ocean and San Diego skyline. They put in like millions of dollar of renovations and the new place is amazing. They custom build the ceremony site with a huge metal arch which is beautiful.
2) Our wedding co-coordinator was Stephanie and she was amazing, very prompt in replying to email and helped us in every step of the wedding planning. Some one here pointed out that tom ham's been not flexible which is not true, they were extremely flexible. Hey they allowed our dogs to be part of the ceremony which surprisingly a lot of other venues blatantly denied us to have our dogs being part of our ceremony on our special day.
3) The food is amazing . Ours was a mixed Indian-american wedding. The chef actually custom made all the appetizers in Indian style. the main entree was American-italian style and was really good.
4) We booked both the rooms and the price was very decent for ocean/city view venue in san diego.

This place has been everything I dreamed off for my wedding. I ddidnt have any complain. Kudos to the wedding managements.< /Review>

< Review>
today was an embarrassmnt at lunch at the newly remodelled lighthouse.  The restaurent was busy with lots of tourists.  The food was terrible.  My fish and chips looked like a hot dog on a sick with a thick coating of greasy dough.  My chips were plentiful but cold/  there was nothing else on the plate but some condiments.  ther was no bread even to the two people in our party who had salads.  the crab Blt was served on thick slices of breatd that looked like morming French toast.  Our waiter was friendly and effiient  as were the hostesses who seated us.  The locaation is wonderful but the noise decibel  was intolerable.  We were all terribly disappointed at the terrible food served in such a beautiful setting.  Has any of your family tried the luncheon menu?  There certainly must be more palatable food that could be served to complement the SD view which is unsurpassed at the end of Harbor Island.

Absolutely loved my experience here from the moment I walked in - it was a perfect  afternoon lunch with harbor views and our city skyline.  Linger at an outdoor table and watch the sailboats, kayakers, paddleboarders, and jetskis go by.  You can't beat the view.  I'm happy to have discovered this place, to now have another go-to spot to recommend to out of town guests.  I always recommended C-Level lounge for the views, and Tom Ham's is right up there.

They do have their own large parking lot with an abundant number of spaces.

They have a good selection of rotating craft beers, which can be purchased in 4oz, 8oz, or 16oz sizes.

My guest loved her Tuna Nicoise salad; I got to sample one of her hard-boiled eggs which tasted like it was marinated in red wine vinegar and cinnamon - so delicious. I ordered the fish & chips - perfectly battered crispiness. For dessert we tried the  gelato for $3.00/scoop.  The baily's gelato was refreshing.  Highly recommended lunch/brunch location.< /review>

I absolutely love Tom Ham's. We went there tonight and sat in the bar area and had an amazing view of the downtown skyline. We ordered some oysters and other appetizers along with some of their speciality drinks. Their bartenders simply know how to make a drink. While they will make you anything you ask for, you can also ask them for a concoction that is all their own. Tonight we requested a mule, a Tiny Bubbles from their bar menu and asked the bartender to surprise us. He executed all three flawlessly and even wrote down the ingredients of the surprise drink for us.

For dinner we ordered several different types of oysters and shrimp. Unfortunately I am allergic to shellfish so while I didn't have any, everyone in the party said they were good. One of the food runners suggested some of his favorite oysters for the second round and the group said they were superior to the first oysters ordered. He specifically suggested the Luna which our group loved. I ordered the Peach and Burrata salad. I love buratta and will go out of my way to find places that serve it. The salad was amazing and had two huge pieces of burrata included. I will be ordering again the next time I am there. I also ordered the Shishito peppers; while they were good, there were a few that were very hot which I haven't experienced at other restaurants.

Overall, we love the view and the good drinks. The great food is just a fantastic bonus. While many of the other places closer to downtown don't have adequate parking, Tom Ham's has plenty of parking at the end of Harbor Island. We also got to see an amazing sunset over the parking lot as we were leaving. We will be back.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Great sea view. Whole roasted fish and paella. The paella comes out after being sloppy and cool, and the rice is like no rice, and I give up after eating a few spoons. However, whole roasted fish seems to be roasted after roasting a large sea bass in a pan, but the skin was salty and savory and the flesh was quite good. Willing to revisit.

(Original)
바다 전망이 아주 좋음. Whole roasted fish와 빠에야를 시킴. 빠에야는 질척거리고 식어서 나오고 쌀도 안난미 같고 형편 없어 몇 숟갈 먹고 포기. 하지만 whole roasted fish는 큰 농어를 팬으로 구운 후 roast를 한듯한데 껍질은 바삭 짭짤 고소하고 살은 단백한 것이 꽤 훌륭했음. 재방문 의사 있음.< /Review>
