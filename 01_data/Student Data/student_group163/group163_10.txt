This place was better than my usual in Tower. This laundromat had plenty of washers and dryers, to top it off very clean, plenty of room to fold my clothes at good height countertops. Dryers worked really well, plenty of baskets and not crowded. I will be back again.< /review>

< review>
Tried this laundromat for the first time and was highly satisfied with their prices and quality washers and dryers! Saved money here compared to dirty bird. Washers and dryers were super clean and worked great! I used the 3 load washers for only $3.75 and .25 for the dryers. 25 cents gives you 8mins to dry but your entire load will be dry with just $1. Glad I came here today, best part, they have PLENTY of carts and space to sit, fold your laundry! Came on a Sunday and wasn’t jam packed and was pretty calm and relaxing actually. Only thing that I’d say needs improving is the restroom..there was no toilet paper and toilet was dirty, there were also a few spills of laundry soap on the floors by the washers but other than that, it was a great experience.< /review>

Sent my husband on Monday to wash our clothes & he came back home super upset because the attendant was very rude telling him to put on a mask or else he needed to leave the store.Mind you that day there were only 3 people washing, store was really dirty,she got there like at 7:35pm with her kids to work, instead of focusing on cleaning the store she was focused on arguing with my husband.My husband got home with our clothes not dried up well because he didn’t want to keep arguing with the attendant. I’m really disappointed with superclean because usually the attendants at Ashlan are really nice but this lady was not it.<//review>

<Text>I LOVE SuperClean! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable in ALL of their locations.
I'm excited about the new Ashlan location -- a little closer to where I live and the NEW OWNERS really spruced the place up.
CLEAN! NEW MACHINES! AFFORDABLE!
Seriously ... check out this new location. And feel SAFE & SECURE: the Staff is constantly cleaning and all locations follow Covid-19 Health precautions. Love the Contact-Less Pay app!< /Text>< time>

Visited at 3pm on a Thursday and didn't see a soul inside the place--though there was plenty of sketchy-looking people walking around outside. Instead of it being nice that there weren't people in the way, it was kinda...eerie. One of the dryers ate our quarter (was probably broken with no signage) and we could not find any attendants to help us. Gave it an extra star because at least it dried our clothes.< /Review><user_name>Zoë Zamora</user_name><UserId.>111009498577093791285<//UserId.>< Date>

Alright place. A couple of washers and dryers didn't work. Water poured out from a couple of washers onto the floor. Enough to have a slip and fall accident. The owner of the place was nice. This is my first time here. IllI probably be back in a couple of months just to see if anything changed. And the dryers are not as hot as it's advertise.< /Review>

<Text>This place is just barely OK, they claim to have the hottest dryers in town, but after two cycles through three different dryers, my clothes were still damp.

Three washers were out of order and two washers have to have the doors forced closed before you could twist the handles to start them.

Visually and not physically appealing looks dirty.  You decide.</Text><Response>None</Response><user>105234541352710625292< /user><gmap_id>0x8094664f46f83d29:0x48fbaa84ce5fd383< /gmap_id><rate>3< /rate>< Time>

Haven't been here in a year, but it was progressively getting worse when I did. Over time as their washers broke they would remove them. Not including all the other broken washers, they went from having 3 mega as load washers down to 1. Their change machine never worked for the 3 years I lived near by so its a wonder they're still in business.

The dryers are ok, but there are always homeless walking through looking for unattended clothes. I've seen a few people take other peoples laundry, and I've called out a few because I knew it definitely wasn't theirs. If you go here keep a close eye on your clothes and bring change.< /Text>

The ATM is broken, the quarter machine is broken, the California Speed arcade machine is broken, and I have serious doubts about the soap vending machine. But it's fairly clean inside, and all the washers and dryers are in good shape and functional.

The TV mentioned by a previous reviewer seems to be long gone.< /review>

<user>103740494892580471586< /user><review>These guys are amazing! My passenger window was smashed in a robbery and they were able to repair it the day we called and at a great price. I had checked Safelite and their next appointment was 2 weeks away and they quoted me double the price. I called a dealer and their service department is closed on the weekend. I definitely recommend skipping those big corporate shops and go straight to Hi-Tech Auto Glass guys. Best deal and friendly service.<//review><name>Jay Senados</name><Rating>5<//Rating>< resp>

<Review>Very thankful of them. I was on vacation from san diego and my car got broken in to. I called them in the morning before they open up and stopped by the shop after the call. Very professional and fast took care of my car even they didn't have the part. Got it in no time and I was able to get on the road. They did a very clean job. Thank you very much and highly recommend them for any service you may need.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Brought my Infiniti FX35 here on recommendation to repair weather stripping that was cut and damaged due to attempted break in, as well fix a star pattern rock chip. Very friendly caring staff, a family vibe here. Labor cost on par with other shops, work done faster than expected, and they gave a discount since on very close inspection at the right angle the repair wasn't 100% perfect. I appreciate attention to detail like that and would return again. Great food truck tacos nearby, went for lunch and by the the time I ate and walked back, they were done! Good communication via phone and email. A simple, unassuming, busy hole in the wall place you could drive by and miss if not for the signage. Not a posh place, just a few random chairs and a fishtank, though quality of work is superb.< /Text>

<Review>I got hit by a rock on the highway last week and it left a big chip and 2 smaller chips on my windshield. I emailed for a free quote and Doug responded very promptly. I was able to set up a time to get into the shop a few days later. The service was prompt and professional, which I really appreciate. Highly recommend!</Review>< date>

Sent an email on Sunday and received an email reply within an hour from the owner.  Dropped the car Monday at midday and picked the car up for half the price of Safelite/others at 4pm.  Excellent job, great price and fast response. 5 out of 5 stars.< /Text>

These guys had one of the best prices in the area.  They were available to replace my windshield almost immediately.  The service was done quick and looks great.  I would highly recommend them and plan to use them, should I need other glass servicing.< /Text>

<Text>Chose this place over my dealership due to the reviews and I have to agree with them. I sat on hold for 20 minutes before giving up at Toyota and I got an estimate from Hi-Tech in just a couple minutes. They were able to get my car in same day and somehow did the entire window swap in 30 minutes. Thank you so much!</Text>< Pictures>

I rarely leave any reviews online. However I think "Hi-Tech Auto Glass" deserves the hassle of putting down my thoughts.

They gave fast quotes, best price, and timely same-day service for a mobile service (Coming to my office's parking lot to do the job when I was at work).

The replacement job was done nicely. They finished everything within an hour and cleaned up all the broken glasses in my trunk.

Thanks.<//Text>

< Review>
Great, timely service and I had a pleasant conversation both with the owner, and some of the technicians.

My only gripe is that nobody warned me that the replacement glass would not be OEM. The replacement was actually even better than OEM, as it is acoustic solar glass, whereas OEM was just solar. I would definitely still go with the shop's choice even if I was told, however I'd also appreciate a heads up.</Review>

Great customer service. Kept me updated with phonecalls through the whole process. I have a classic car that was broken into and even though they don't make the new glass for my car anymore they were able to find me a used replacement within 24 hours. The next day they replaced it in less than an hour.</Review>

I had my reserves about going there just because the price was so low.  But they were perfect.  I don't know if Doug owns the business or just happened to be the man in charge when I was there.

I chose HiTech because of a recommendation from a friend. They had the best price and fastest turnaround time quote (next day, same day).

During the install, they unfortunately caused a small scratch. However Doug and the team came over the top and offered to either fix the scratch immediately with a local body shop or waive the windshield replacement entirely. I was happy to accept either offer but in this case went with the free windshield replacement ($1200 value).

We all make mistakes, but how we deal with our mistakes and make good on them says a lot about character and trustworthiness. I would trust Doug and the team at Hitech with any glass repair in the future and wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking for glass repair in the Bay area. Not only am I confident they will be able to beat or match a quote anywhere else, the level of service is impeccable.< /review>

I got the best price on my window repairs for a Nissan Sentra. The owner was quick, trusting, and true to his word. He quoted me immediately and ordered the parts needed for my repair after one quick phone call. The repair was supposed to take 1.5 hrs but it took two 45 min sessions on two days since the first parts ordered didn't fit. Still, good job, done fast, made easy.<//Review>

Doug is so friendly and was super quick to get me in. Had my window fixed in a few hours, and it was cheaper than going to the dealer.

He even gave me tips on dealing with insurance. A very kind man! Will definitely go there again if I have any window problems.<//Text>

<Review>OMG, these guys are amazing!!!! My car got broken into and because I was in between moving from one place to another, a lot of my valuable things were stolen from the car. I was super sad, but the guys who helped to fix my window, not only did a great job, but also cleaned my super dirty car that I have been barely driving, fixed the button that they were not even supposed to fix and brought my car to my work place. This was the only good thing that happened during my long day. I also called different shops for the prices, and this shop gave me the best price. I am very grateful to the people who work at this shop!</Review>< pics>

Doug provided fantastic service at each stage of my experience with him. I called several places for an estimate on my sunroof, which had been broken by a rogue golf ball. He was able to give me a quote very quickly, and was able to email me a pdf version in about 10 minutes, which I needed to bring to the offending golf course.
Many of the places I called were not able to do the sunroof on my Lexus, so it was nice that Doug was able to handle it. He also gave me an option for both a new and a used version, which I appreciated.
Actual service was prompt and no nonsense.
To top it off, his guys dropped the vehicle off at my home when they were done, saving me the hassle. Will not even think about going anywhere else for glass issues.<//review>

Been here twice, once to replace chips on the windshield, on which they did an excellent job and charged only $50-55 for two chips, and the other for a windshield on a 2007 Lexus ES350, for which they did for $215. These guys gave me the best prices, and the best customer experience. The job is professionally done and they staff is friendly. I also found out they'll go to your house for only $20 extra and do everything at home! Definitely the best option because when you account for the time and gas to get here and wait (takes one hour) it's worth it!!! Don't go anywhere else than here for auto glass repair and replacement. Very satisfied customer.< /review>

<Review>I came in here a few years back to replace the windshield of my Mazda. Affordable pricing 👍🏾 Friendly customer service👍🏾 Quick replacement 👍🏾 And they vacuumed out all the broken glass and wiped down the front of my dashboard/vacuumed both front seats out.

My friend gets her back window broken on a night out, I brought her car here and everything went amazingly!

My other friend has a rock hit her window and now it’s cracked and I’ve recommended her coming here for replacement when she gets back from her trip.

I love this business.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>After my insurance company's provider, Safelite, flaked I took my car here for a crack on our brand new Audi Q7 windshield. Safelite had told me because the crack was in the line of sight I'd need a whole new windshield. Doug at Hi Tech, without seeing the car, ordered me a new windshield. But when I brought the car in he said he could easily fix it and that would only cost $45 and be better because I wouldn't be messing with the original seals around the windshield. He fixed it in 30 minutes and helped me contact my insurance by phone while I was there to sort through it. The crack is almost invisible (he warned me it would 75% disappear) and I left feeling that he was an honest shop, only selling me what was needed. And great service. Thanks Doug!!!< /Review>< userid>

I'll keep this short and sweet. These guys are awesome! My car was broken into and I needed to have the window fixed ASAP. They were able to replace it in under 30 mins and on top of that, they gave me a discount since I mentioned that I found them on Yelp. So, the next time you need your window fixed, save yourself the hassle of researching and just take it to Hi-Tech!< /Review>

The new windshield looks great and they got rid of some ugly trim the previous owner painted over, however they had to work on the rain sensor and managed to get a hair between the glass and the newly glued sensor along with small amounts of excess glue. Although this was just due to an issue with me specifically, they most likely won’t need to work on your rain sensor.</review>

Turned out that when I arrived, they only then realized that they didn't have the correct parts.    So, I had to return another day.   The work they actually did was done very poorly.  The weather seal around my windshield was not fitted properly, and they left blue tape across the top of my windshield.   The result has been damage to my car due to water leakage from rain.  I believe all the positive reviews of the guys must be counterfeit as they showed high degree of incompetence.  BEWARE these guys are sloppy and workmanship is poor -- I think this was deliberate because they are RACIST.   STAY AWAY!< /Text>< pictures>

Needed to replace shattered side window for my Acura, so called them up in the morning.  Price quoted on the phone $130 was reasonable.  Went in that afternoon and it was fixed in just 45 min, with no surprising charges tacked on.  The power window switch wasn't working but rather than try to sell me a new switch, they just fixed the connection. They were meticulous, vacuuming up all the broken glass and cleaning off tape residue.<//Text>

These guys are amazing!
Staff is kind and nice.
I got my tailgate window broken this morning and I'm fixing it now, and I think they gonna finish in just in an hour. They cleaned up everything like glass fragments and doing their job meticulously.
If you got your car window broken, go to the Hi-Tech!

And, I got my window broken at Ghirardeli parking building. So be careful at Ghirardeli parking building. YOU MUST PARK YOUR FRONT AHEAD! But ,even though my window was broken , I and my son really enjoyed the place and chocolate. Ghirardeli chocolate staffs are really kind and gentle. I really love their chocolate.< /text>

<text>My experience in one word: Amazing

The near 5 star rating on this place is very well earned. My situation with a half cracked windshield on my Audi RS5 took a full 180 turn from being a more than a 2 week wait, damning me to drive to and from work every day with a half cracked windshield for weeks only to be replaced with an aftermarket Chinese part, to a 1 day wait with an OEM windshield professionally installed on my car the *next* day. All while paying exactly the same amount on my deductible, since he was able and willing to work with my State Farm insurance to cover the remaining cost. He even offered a price that was *less* than my deductible if I didn't want to go OEM, which was good. No other provider I called (and I called many) offered that sort of deal. Working with Doug was simple; he was quick and handled everything professionally. He took down my VIN to ensure he had precisely the right windshield for my car (manufactured by Saint-Gobain Sekurit, acoustic insulation, emblem and everything). He even gave me a loaner to take home while I waited 90 minutes... I said I could just call and Uber, but he insisted!

Contrast that with my original appointment I made with Safe Lite, who could only fit me in after 2 weeks and 1 day of calling. Also, they weren't going to be able to provide OEM; only after market. Originally, I suspected that my only safe route for professional OEM installation would have been with a dealer, however the *earliest* available appointments with any of the local Audi dealerships were more than 3 weeks out (which is typical of Audi unfortunately). I called 3 dealerships, only 1 was able to answer my call (for parts department) and all of my calls to the service departments went to voicemail and never even returned my call.

I'm just amazed that my situation was handled so quickly (next day), simply and affordably (easily worked with insurance), with the quality I wanted (OEM) and was cleanly and professionally installed on a relatively high end car. Having all of those things in combination was a pretty mind blowing experience. That was refreshing, considering what I thought I was originally facing!  Thanks again Doug!</text><pictures>None</pictures><date>1492035473020< /date><Resp>None<//Resp><UserId.>118304952799472900946</UserId.>< username>

I have been here twice to replace cracked windshields and each time they have come in way bellow the price of other shops. My sun roof cracked this week so I called Hi-Tech and they said it would typically cost $700 to replace but they offered to find a used one without me even asking. They called back and said they could fix it for $250! You won't find better service anywhere else.< /text>

<text>Service was okay but they put less meat than what was normal which is a no no for me since their subs in general are getting pricey.
The one in Sawtelle has much better quality overall< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Went to subway yesterday 2-2-18, orders a wrap and a meatball sandwich and I did eat the meatball until the next day and it was bad, most of the meatballs were burned on one side, and the wrap was dry even after I ask them to put mayo on it,  now I use to work at subways and was taught not to waste food but was also taught if the meatballs are burned and dry you do not use them..and I would like to know why this is the only subways that sells footlong  for $7;99, when everyone else's (subway)sells footlong 's for $6;99, as seen also on t.v.  I will never go back to this store, do not like what the do with their meats,</Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Date>

<text>Game World was such a great discovery for me and my kids! We would of never known this place existed if it wasnt for my surrounding cities being sold out of what we were looking for. We drove a distance to get there but I will definitely make it again just for the great service and selections they had on old & new!! And so much more! This place is hands down better than gamestop and I will be going there for our future needs! The lady Nellie and her husband( i think) were so lovely and helpful over the phone and in person. They were friendly and listened to my kids questions and other things and had no problem helping them which made them feel good. This is the kind of place where the business appreciates you and makes you want to come back and have you leaving feeling good. Thanks for the great experience! We will be back😊</text>< Pics>

Cool little game shop in the Barstow area hard to find though if you aren't from the area.  Its located inside the old mall to the left of the main entrance when you walk inside.  Great selection of games and accessories.</Review>

Friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable staff and a great selection of games from brand new to old school. Not to mention plenty of accessories and trading card games. You can spend plenty of time just browsing and looking around at the amount of stuff they have.</review>

<date>1528597672977<//date><review>It is a great little game store but, some of the accessories I bought for a GameCube I just recently bought there were faulty, I also wish they had an easier way to check if they have something specific in stock I had to wait a while to see if they had a specific item, the prices are very reasonable and the staff are very nice and helpful. I have yet to trade in things but it is a great place to shop for games New and Old, I hope that the one in Fort Irwin has a great variety of games. I know smash bros Melee won't come in soon but, I can dream I guess.

-Hope sales are great, Sincerely Luis Navarro JR</review>< user_name>

<Text>This place is really fun to check out! They have plenty of retro gaming consoles/accessories/games as well as new gen. They have a large assortment of trading cards from magic to pokemon as well as deck boxes,card sleeves, play mats. The staff/owners are extremely knowledge of their product and will help you find what you are looking for even if they dont have it. They have an amazing loyalty program as well and have layaway options that are reasonable. I always have a great experience everytime I shop here, and plan on giving them my buisness in the future.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c47cb74fdd620d:0x57fc164b74911ee3<//Gmap_id><username>Mark P<//username><Rating>5<//Rating><Time>1571677749944<//Time><UserId.>104405506579500039737< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Always nice and helpful staff. 1000's of games from retro through current systems plus movies and games and anime. Oh and memorabilia. They really have a lot of stuff if you're into collecting or just looking for a used/new game or console. I prefer them over chains like Gamestop.< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Bought the original Xbox, brought it back within 3 days rather my money be refunded I was called a liar and after that system was tested and the issue are found to be true I was offered a worse game console that in turn didn’t work, bunch of con artists if you ask me.

<time>1515437470420</time><text>Very Great Place for GAMERS. So much stuff for every system. My 8 year old can stay here for hours looking for ds games. Great trade in prices too vs gamestop. Higher payout prices. Everything is well priced. New and used items. So much to see and look at in here. I would suggest to anybody looking to buy or sell their games and stuff. Thank you guys at Game World.</text>< pics>

<text>I think there were 2 working pumps here? We tried one, and there was no gas. Another wouldn’t read the card. A third had a broken screen. It took us 4 tries to find a working gas pump here. There was only one pump (out of I think 6) at the station that was marked out of order. I’ll be finding another place to get gas.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x8092077e0ed26b83:0xeea589394650a04c</GmapID></record>

Very friendly employees. Inside well kept. Outside, A disaster. Thugs, homeless, & Streetwalkers hanging around day & night. not the store's fault, but a very un comfortable place to be. They do have the best prices on Gas.<//Review>

I had a storage unit with the girl Laura before and she had let me know she was transferring to this new storage. When i hurd I left were I was, to go to the new one. She provides me with that safe feeling and clear payment options. With her good customer service I always know I get the best deal and my belongings are safe. So if you have a slum lord storage manager go talk to Laura she will get you a great price, the place is clean and the faculty is secure!<//Review>

Laura Jo is an excellent manager. I rent at this location versus other places because of their customer service. The facility itself is nice, easy access and affordable. Walk in and rent with Laura, she is the best!</text>

Make sure you make your payments are on time. If you are late by a couple of days, they will not remove your late fee. In times like this they should be happy people are paying.
They only care about the bottom line. The new Manager there has no customer relations skills.<//review>

This place is awesome. laura is the most helpful and genuinely a great person. Her level of professionalism and kindness make working out of town no longer a worry. Now getting locked in cus I wasn't paying attention after hours....
Just kidding, when it's my fault then it's my fault. Other than human error, nothing could make me change my initial choice to do business here.<//review>

I have been renting here now since October last year. It has been an experience that is light years better than what I went through elsewhere!
Huge thanks to Laura for her stellar customer service and ever present kindness!< /text>

<text>Laura Jo and Nic are an excellent team. I am a proud customer renting from a small, family owned business during these tough times. I feel that the prices are fair, the units are easy to drive up to and the employees are so nice and friendly. I highly recommend this location, come here and support this location.</text><GmapID>0x80dd2eab86225c57:0x9802cd2e17dd81b6<//GmapID>< user>

<Review>Laura Jo was excellent by calling ahead of time to make sure we avoided any late fee. We have multiple units here and was mis informed about our second unit, however Laura Jo has our back! Great customer service, security and place to rent. I trust my items here more than anywhere else. This business actually cares. Thank you!< /Review>< gmapID>

Jessica was absolutely one of the nicest people I've ever dealt with at a storage facility. Super professional and laid back at the same time. She deserves a Vacation or something because she was really running around trying to see new people and rent out new units while she saw to the needs of her regular customers too. Highly Recommend.< /review>

The facility is quiet and clean. The management goes above and beyond! Jessica made me feel welcome and even stayed open late to rent my storage unit to me. I am confident that I made the right choice and look forward to moving in! Thank you Jessica!!😊😎🥳</Review>

I have to say that I never really expected the level of service that I received from a storage facility.  I am very, very happy with the service I received from Stor-Mor :) While going through the application process to get set up with a storage unit, the process was easy, and very professional and courteous staff.  Jessica Allen, the property manager their, has a great professional attitude, with a very upbeat personality and an awesome sense of humor :) I was able to get the size unit that I wanted, and gave me a good price with a great deal on my move in :) I really like the facility :) I feel very safe having my belongings there, and the facility is very secure :) In addition, Danica Klausner, the relief manager, is also a great person with a great personality and sense of humor.  I am really happy with their policies and procedures as well.  If you need to rent a storage unit, I really don't think you need to look any further than Stor-Mor :) You'll be very glad you did :)</Text>

We've only been using Stor-Mor for a few months now... We held a unit online (special rate) and called to verify. Sarah answered and was very friendly and helpful. When we went to the Cypress location, she took the time to help us pick out the right unit for our comfort level (looked at about 5 units). Did I mention our 2 kids under 5 were with us. hahaha. The paperwork itself took no time at all. So far this place is great! Set up the auto payment or keep a credit card on file, so much easier!!! We get email reminders and just call in to charge cc on file. I've talked to Jessica as well and shes very sweet and accommodating as well. Love that its gated and you need a code to get in and out.</Text>

I cant say enough about Stor-More Self Storage.. Patrick is so helpful and very efficient.  I called 3 places and this was the most affordable and clean . Patrick was kind enough to offer a moving truck to move my furniture for free , yes i said FREE ..  I highly recommend this company.  Thank you very Patrick i appreciate everything you did for my husband and I...< /review>

With SO many Storage places eveywhere it isn't the most shiny. Could use some painting of storage unit doors and the inside facility buildings Did get some much needed repaving recently tho. A good place to work if you like dealing with money, customer issues and lack of training.<//Text>

Extremely upset with this company. I opened my unit on October 1st 2018 and paid full price. I paid for November full price. When I went back to pay for December I was told I had a balance due for the previous month. I provided my bank statements showing I had paid in full. They sent an email to the corporate office saying I had provided proof of payment. A few days after I recieved a notice that I still have not paid and recieved a late fee. Yet again I went down and provided my proof of my statements paying for the two months I had been there as well as the upcoming month of December. I had paid 3 times for 3 months. They sent another email saying I had proof and I was informed by the office employee  that I should have recieved a move in discount which I never recieved. I closed my unit and moved out. I now received another notice stating that I still owe a balance for a months rent as well as 2 late fees. Currently dealing with this problem and seeking to speak directly with the head office. VERY UNSATISFIED WITH THIS COMPANY.< /Text>

I have been at Stor-Mor for 6 months and I must say the service is excellent! The staff is always friendly and professional, the monthly rates are great and they offered the use of their moving truck at no cost when we moved in! The facility is clean and secure and they offer many payment options which make it very convenient to pay your monthly storage fee. A+++++ for Stor-Mor!<//Review>

Great music! They're located in the back corner of the shopping center so easy to miss. Nice stage with various bands (awesome Jazz & Rock), good bar, and simple Mexican food menu. Lots of bigscreens for games when no live events. Food prices a bit high, and there is a 2-drink min. with an additional 20% gratuity on all tabs instead of cover charge. Took off a star because it can have that sticky/stale beer vibe on occasion.<//review>

< Review>
This is by far a hidden gem in Woodland Hills.  Tucked in the corner of a shopping center, this speak easy-esk establishment is small, welcoming, and provides top notch comedy talent on Mondays and Saturday nights.  Sit towards the front, there's tables for 2, 4 and more.  4-5 comedians visit the stage providing a plethora of humor.  No cover charge, 2 drink minimum, and plenty of FREE parking at the shopping center.  Don't think twice about it, just go!  You will have a wonderful evening of laughs.  It's next to the Thai restaurant in the corner of the shopping center.< /Review>

It's a great venue with a well designed stage and sound, but there's no dance floor. Why?? Watching live bands while slouching in my seat is no fun! 🙄🙄< /Text>

<text>When they get a dance floor it will be interesting. Basic club with 2 drink minimum and live music. Talent is usually good. I felt like dancing but alas, no dance floor yet.</text>< Rating>

It's the kind of place that when you wander in and wonder out loud why it took you so long to find it that the regulars around you put a finger to their lips and tell you to keep your find of this lovely place to yourself.  That is quite literally what happened to me on the first evening I took in a show at the Write Off.  Simply enchanting.< /Text>

Fair pricing and excellent service all around. My surface pro 3 was not able to function after I logged in. The screen was unresponsive and completely blue, I thought my computer was done for. However they were able to quickly fix my issue in less than a day. I will be coming here in the future for any future issues that I may have with my computers.<//Text>

<Text>My desktop hard drive was essentially fried and in really bad shape. I took it in hoping that anything would be able to be recovered. Julio told me he would do his best to salvage what he could. Called me later in the day to let me know he was pretty much able to recover all the files and documents. I also purchased a new desktop from him and he placed the data recovery file on it. I was also able to look over everything and make sure it was to my satisfaction. Julio quoted me as to what can only be called a remarkably fair price and I'm probably underselling how fair it actually was. For both the data recovery and new desktop, I couldn't believe it. I will always go back for any of my computer needs. If you are looking for a quality professional business to go along with great value, you will be happy you went to Zap Computer Repair.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Amazing! I really thought my computer was a lost cause because it was completely soaked in water. I was so upset, but Zap Computer Repair was able to fix it! They have great service and are super kind. They also work super quick! Anywhere else, I probably would have had to wait weeks, but they had it done within days! I am super happy with their work, and if I ever have any more computer problems, I know where to go. Definitely recommend!<//Review>

My experience was great from start to beginning the 1st day I called and left a message with my issue name and number and the very next morning he gave me a call back, I dropped off my laptop it had issues of the screen not showing so I thought it was the backlight, anyway, the very next day as my kid is so so sad without her laptop (she uses it for school and a game) I get the phone call that the laptop is ready. The price was perfect , it was great to be honest. With everything else going on,  this was the last thing I wanted to deal with or spend money on but it's a necessity for school. I have officially found my repair guy. Thanks a ton. Oh and I forgot to mentioned he cleaned it. It's nice and clean. My teen says "thank you , thank you ,thank you....ooooo it's so clean".<//Review>

I had been looking for another laptop, and Julio gave me a great deal on a used Dell touch screen. It looks brand new.
I am a return customer who highly recommends Zap Computer.</review>

<Text>I've been going to Zap for many years and you won't find a better place. They have built several computers for me as well as fixing any problems that I may have caused. Viruses, slow computer, whatever the problem, they have always been eager to help. Also very reasonably priced and  knowledgeable. Julio is the best!< /Text>< GmapID>

My computer had been restarting at random for months and I tried everything to fix it myself to no avail. So I brought it in and was greeted with friendly service and fair pricing. In a few days the problem was solved and my computer was back up and running. This is now my go to repair shop and it should be yours too!</text>

<review>Highly Recommend
To start, I have my own tech that can assist me with my computer, however since I moved, I wanted to look for someone closer. I checked online and Zap Computer Repair came up and was really close by. I went ahead to the location with my laptop and spoke to Julio. I explain that my laptop would take a long to start and would get an error message. Ounce my laptop reach the main screen, again it would run really slow and wouldn't open any of the apps. It even crashed and the screen would turn black. Right there and then, he knew what was wrong with my laptop and explain the issue. I was surprised how quick he was able figure out what the issue was and what was needed to fix it. So I left my laptop with him and within 1 DAY.....1 DAY he was able to fix my laptop good as new! Now it runs faster, smoother and Windows 10 is the best! I'm defiantly come back to this location and HIGHLY recommend them! Thanks Julio!<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2d3b5f567cdf9:0x3dbba5777c8bed11</Gmap_id></record>

Such Amazing Service! I had a PC build that wouldn't boot up (no post). I took to two other shops one which told me was bad ram and the other said bad motherboard. Came to Zap's 12/3/19 about 3pm they told me they would call me tomorrow with the diagnosis. The very next day mid morning they had my computer up and running.... ram and motherboard were fine!!!!! Ask if they could install an OS as well, and they told me sure I can pick it up this afternoon! So at 5pm 12/4/19 I had my computer fixed and running with about a 24hr turn around time! I was so hyped finally getting my PC running. I'm only come here for service in the future. Thank you so much guys.</Text>

Horrible Service!! I drove from Lynwood to get my dell laptop issues fixed  because of their "great" reviews and it so happen that the owner wasn't even in the office! I got no quote or diagnostics. Couple of people at the place had said something about him being out and wont be back until later. It was very urgent and it was a waste of my time and efforts. Why own a business if you aren't going to be there. Lost a valuable customer. I would give 0 stars for punctuality!! Be aware, owner might not be there.< /text>

I’d give 10 stars if possible, had my laptop supposedly repaired elsewhere only to find it in worse condition. They had it for 6 weeks so I looked for the highest rated company by me and there is a reason for that. They had my Mac back to perfection in just 2 days and ended up doing more work as they found more problems but did not raise the estimated price. You want it done right this is the place!<//review>

<review>zap computer repair, great service! The tech offered to sell me an external mouse for the same price he payed for it because the touch mouse on my laptop stopped working. When I came in to buy the mouse, he took a quick look at the computer, fixed my touch and still sold me the external. Great shop!<//review>< Pictures>

To be honest, no service was done. I walked in with a computer that was giving me problems starting up (as in, it wouldn't). I walked out with a computer that turned on. All it took was 5 minutes and a quick caring touch by Max. No work was done. But the friendliness when I walked through my problem was incredibly welcome. I will definitely be coming through again.</Text>

I had two computers repaired by Zap Computers and both were not working at the time of service. The one reason I picked this place instead of others ( there are many to choose from) was the strong and convincing reviews I read on Yelp. When I first met Julio, I was most impressed by his demeanor and his knowledge of computers. Without any reservation, I entrusted my two computers ( one Samsung all-in-one desk top and one Toshiba lap top), with lots of personal info. to his able hands. Within 48 hours, they were all ready for pickup. Their repair cost was very reasonable for everything did to the computers. I highly recommend them for any computer repair you need.
My 5 star rating was given because of the exceptional service he provided after the fact when my desktop was highjacked by a falsified HP Representative online who injected several viruses onto my computer after I refused to pay an outrageous sum to help me download the proper HP driver. I didn’t know about this until I couldn’t  find my old Document files. I called Julio again for help. Not only did he (his highly knowledgeable tech partner) recovered all my old files which were moved to a different folder by the fake HP rep, he also removed several and all injected viruses from the computer and stopped future entry by other intruders without my knowledge. They did an outstanding job on the computer. For this above-and-beyond work, they earned their 5 star rating which I have never given in any previous reviews.< /Text>

AWESOME!
I would give more stars if I could.
Very professional.
No hidden fees.
Quick service.
Charged me 1/3rd the cost what Apple was going to charge me.
I am telling everyone I know to use Julio.
I couldn't be more pleased.
Thank you Zap!<//Review>

<Review>Julio was of great help. The first time I took my laptop he was able to recover all of my data for school! I was amazed how quick he did the job and the price. Unfortunately my laptop's hard drive died soon after but again Julio was there to fix it! Thank you so much to the Zap Computer Repair team for your great service!<//Review>< Time>

Took my built PC (that wouldn't even start) there and he was able to tell me in less than a day what was wrong with it. Saved me countless hours and hardware that I dont have. Also didn't try to make me buy the part needed and was very respectful. Also doesn't talk down because of lack of computer knowledge.

Great service!! I have taken my computer there for repair and they were able to fix it and it runs faster than before. The turn around was fast and the price was great. I have recommended Zap to a couple of friends and they always have great things to say about how happy they are to trust someone to work on their computer. I would not go anywhere else to have my computer fixed.</Text>

This place is great! . I went in thinking my laptop fan had died, Julio gave me a reasonable estimate about what the cost would be to replace it so I took it in. He called me the next day telling me the fan was just clogged so he just had to clean it out, and that he was only charging me for having to open the computer up, which was a giant relief. He was very helpful throughout the whole process, I would definitely recommend you go here if you have any problems with your computer.<//review>

I recently brought in (2) Lap tops to Zap.They were very courteous quick turn around on the repairs and gave me a great deal. I had previous brought them to Best Buy and was going to have to wait 4 weeks and had mine done in a couple days.
Thanks ZAP</Review>

Reminds my of businesses of years ago where customers are appreciated and treated with respect rather than an annoyance. Took in my water damaged Macbook Pro, within a day received a call from them to authorized the repairs. 5 days later my Macbook was back to normal.  Great work and great service.</text>

I am very hard to please - hate to spend money and try to fix everything myself.

Julio was able so nice on the phone that I gave him a shot, and boy did he deliver.

Zap's shop is big, clean and organized - you can tell that Julio has pride in the location - it is impressive to walk in and see the setup.

Both of my laptops had issues - one was very slow, and the other would just get stuck in an auto-shutdown and restart loop. Julio was able to save my data, clean & restore both laptops, and gave me tips on what I can do to keep them running cooler and faster. He even fixed what a previous tech from another shop illegally installed on one of my Laptops.

Zap has a customer for life with me - I am recommending this shop to everyone, and I challenge you to call for a quote!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Be careful to cross into Mexico auto parts because they pay taxes if they do not want to pay 16% of their net value in dollars for said parts, hide them 😈 if they can or cannot cross them 🙍

(Original)
Tengan cuidado de cruzar a México  auto refacciones  pues estas pagan impuestos si no quieren pagar el 16% de su valor neto en dolares por dichas refacciones  ocultenlas 😈 si pueden o no las  crucen 🙍< /review>

The best place to be for a Los Angeles sunset view. They have some cool photo opportunities, and cool backdrops to choose from if you'd prefer. The slide situation, in my opinion, isn't really worth it, but still did it to say I did it! Would recommend just going for drinks and the view instead of paying extra to slide down for a couple of seconds. They do take a photo and it's available to purchase, though, if you'd like (can't take your phone out/on the slide). Drinks were a little pricy, but to be expected for L.A. and an attraction like that. Despite the price, it was a great tasting cocktail. Music was fun, too, and definitely set the mood for the outdoor view.</Text>

I would recommend this spot. 5/5

Cool spot. You get a good view of the surrounding LA area. The space was clean, there's a cool museum going up, and a clear glass slide that takes you down 1 floor to the deck.

There's also a bar up there if your up for a cold drink 🍻 or coffee.

Bathroom are also pretty clean and well-stocked.

There's a parking lot right next to the building.<//Review>

most stunning view over Los Angeles. Can even see the Hollywood sign. would recommend to come before sunset so you see the City in day and night time plus the incredible sunset. simply amazing! one of the top things to do in LA downtown.</Text>

While I think that it's still a bit on the side of massive daycare facility, it is a very good place for children, especially those who don't get exposed to the types of activities they have on a regular basis.  I also recommend that everyone takes advantage of the ample hand sanitizers as children can be, well, children.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Text>The view is great. Would make a great date. The only reason it didnt get 5 stars because some of the staff was "just there" or not there. A couple times I ran into signs that said wait here for attendant and they were no where to be found. No real explanation on slide picture. Guy just hands you a number. Slide was really quick. Overall I would go back on a date just to sit and have drinks and enjoy the view.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Beautiful views from the top kinda reminded me of the Stratosphere in Vegas. Theres is the long walk way that shows some history of downtown and LA teams. Once at the top there’s a bar on top and the slide. A nice romantic spot will go back to check out the night scene. It is worth going at least once. It was 26$ to go up and there’s separate charges for slide.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Good view and good spot for photo. The slide is short and kind of expensive. This is one of the time spot for tourist. There are cafes and lounges for people who want to hang around.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9</GmapID><time>1611556279985<//time><user>102769973160996305254<//user><Response>None< /Response></record>

<review>Unique view LA from on the of tallest building. It has open air areas with glass walls for uninterrupted view. They have glass slide too. It is nice to relax at the outdoor area. There is also restaurant and cafe for snacks and light lunches.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<username>Suzy Ruiz< /username><Time>1575230555356< /Time><rate>5</rate><text>A great place to visit. Give yourself at least 2 hours to fully enjoy. I came here 1st time at night and it was great. This time around I wanted to see the sunset and part of the night, it was even better. Very organized and friendly staff. Security screening at door before getting on the elevators, gives you that peace of mind. Elevators were surprisingly smooth and quick! My kids enjoyed this very much, a must for anyone!<//text>< pictures>

<text>Enjoyed watching the sunset on the observation deck. I also rode down the slide and took pictures in front of the famous Colette Miller angel wings. There are two wings on opposite sides of the deck so make sure you explore the whole deck. Staff here are informative and friendly.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMd9u71dDGamFjsT6oKyKzqhPR3J9oiyPZZCOWH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< rate>

<review>$33 admission with slide included. Price is same on-line as in person. You can buy without slide ride but personally I enjoyed the slide ride. Great view at the top and everyone is friendly, patient and helpful. You can spend as much time as you'd like and take as many pictures as you want. Much better than the Chicago Skydeck experience and much less crowded. Love it!< /review>< pictures>

This is a great experience. The skyspace area is really well designed with floor to ceiling windows, benches and seating up next to the windows and facing out, and open air outdoor areas as well. The bar is solid with pricing about average (10 buck cocktails).<//Review>

I did the slide on the side of the building.  It was cool. The views from the deck are amazing.  You can see the city for miles and the mountains in the background made it that more beautiful.</text>

<rate>4<//rate><review>i saw the sky slide  in 2016 and decided to go there on during one of my vacation in 2016, i had purchased parking online but traffic in downdown L.A. was hectic and i ended up in another Parking Structure and not the one i had paid parking for, my problem was that i was unfamiliarwith the downtown area and i was running late to my timeslot, i got there and went up to the observation areai had brought a few camera for slide down but ws told that i had to hold the sack i was gonna slide odwn on with both had, the slide was over in abot 5-10 seconds, it went quick, i actually paid $8.00 for another slide down since my chest camera had tilted downward, i may go back once they add more features or attractions<//review><Pictures>[{'url':

<rating>5<//rating><text>I haven't been "just for fun" but I photographed a proposal here and it was amazing. My client booked a specific part of the deck and had it decorated and waiting for him and his girlfriend when they arrived and he proposed. The sunset was INCREDIBLE from the view. Definitely a good place to do a romantic proposal. The part of the deck you reserve is blocked off with a rope so other guests can see what's going on but they aren't allowed in your space. People could tell something exciting was about to happen so a crowd formed at the rope and then everyone erupted in applause when he proposed and she said yes. The crowd of people might be intimidating for some, but I think it added to the experience and they were still far enough away to where they couldn't actually hear the couples conversation.

My membership with the American Horticulture Society gets me in under the reciprocal program and it is actually cheaper. Love this place. During the summer they have extended hours and occasional free concerts. Lots of shade for those walks on hot days. Plus it has some cool stuff in the gift shop. Well worth the membership.< /Review>

<Text>Unique view LA from on the of tallest building. It has open air areas with glass walls for uninterrupted view. They have glass slide too. It is nice to relax at the outdoor area. There is also restaurant and cafe for snacks and light lunches.< /Text>< GmapID>

Pros:
Nice place if you love breathtaking views.
When you are on 70th floor, other things look so small.
There is a glass ride you can take. It's similar to a sloping glass bridge.
Ride is optional. You can opt for the ride later too, it's $8.
There are some fun activities inside like creating boomerangs and all, you can enjoy, click pictures, shoot videos for fun.
Seating place for few is also there on top.
A must visit place in LA.

Cons:
None, glass ride could have been longer to make it more thrilling though.

Advice:
Counter ticket price is $30 but look for online tickets to get some discount. You can get ~20% discount from tickets online, enquire over the counter before purchasing if they will accept it and are willing to give the discount.</Text>

I am terrified of heights and never thought in a million years I would do something like this but I am very happen that I did. There is a fee to get up to top and ride but its worth it. The whole walk through has a bunch or LA history and fun activities as well as photo opportunities  that can be purchased on the way back down. The slide itself is visually terrifying but totally worth it, it doesn’t last long and you slide off on to this beautiful astroturfed balcony of sorts that has some of the most breathtaking views I have ever seen. If you are questioning if you should go, stop! Because You most Definitely should.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>We decided to see what all the hype was about today and on a whim made the trek downtown to go to Slyspace. It’s a little pricey at $33/person (including riding the slide), but the views from the 70th floor were truly breathtaking. I’ve lived in LA for a while now, and this gave me the opportunity to see the city in a way I never have before. There are two outdoor patios with sweeping views of the city. It was even clear enough to see the ocean, which is remarkable. The slide was fun and it was cool to just walk around and take in the views. I’d definitely recommend checking it out.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Great place to visit. Pay for the slide! They have a nice bar with bar food to eat so if your really hungry eat first before you go up there.

Oue skyspace is a unique place in LA offering a tremendous view of the city. It towers over everything and has a great atmosphere. There are a couple ticket options one of which takes you to the highest level of the building(The more expensive one). It includes a ticket to ride on a clear slide that hangs over the edge of the building. The slide lands at a flat outside terrace with glass panneling allowing you to view the entire city. Inside there are many lounge areas all of which have great views. Inside also offers a bar area with fairly cheaply priced drinks(a separate section of the bar offers wines).</text>

For people who like the take pictures with a good backdrop, this is the place to be. I came here to conquer my fear of heights, and was totally distracted from that fear with how nice the place was inside. There was a bar where you could purchase drinks and snacks, several adorable walls to take pictures in front of (the wings outside are stunning) and seating for lounging both inside and out. I imagine at night the place is even more amazing, with the view of the city below you. Another plus is they have military discount!<//review>

It was fun. However, I would never pay $20 again to go up there. It's good to go once in your life. The slide was very short.</Text>

<review>The views of LA are nice but it’s $25 per person just to go up the elevator. It’s an additional $8 to ride the slide. (It was cheaper in Tokyo than this.. kinda ridiculous)

Needless to say I didn’t do the slide cause I’m cheap lol.

But views were great. I’d go during sunset though. If you go during the day you Can go back at night time for an “upgrade” fee of $10 each ticket.</review><name>Shane< /name><resp>None< /resp>< time>

< Review>
The view from the top was amazing. I felt the tickets are bit on the higher side. Also the photographs they click inside are super expensive and not worth it. I bought my pic doing the sky slide which was fun but paying for the printed picture was worthless< /Review>

This may very well be the first stop as a visitor or local looking for perspective to reflect upon.  You better believe in engineering and physics if you take the glass slide and even the elevators up 71 floors (there is a transition between 2 elevator sets) may give some pause, up up up to the restaurant and bar level.  This place is chill and classy, thank you America and LA energy.
STEM Tip:   Don’t forget the acceleration of gravity is 9.86 m/s^2!!   So one might say spiritually, find the brakes on your vehicle to check your speed!<//text>

It is one of the most unique vistas in southern California<//review>

When you are not open during Covid why it is showing as OPEN. Please change, when I entered in parking space and found this is not operational, you still need to pay 4$ to parking fee. Don’t waste your money. Don’t go now.</Text>

<review>Amazing place to get a good view! My only complaint is that this place will still operate when its sprinkling but will not allow its guests to go out on the balcony for pictures. I think that is something that should be stated before the person purchases a ticket. Well other than that the place has good views (from inside) and good selection of drinks. Would like to come back if only to get the balcony experience.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAt1R3KKEffcheGOScepf99LL31DDet_-hIYGe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSnjcoj9CYzQwHeUQ-i6X2QK1vi8_bSWNwD7GT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOt6ttl46DI70-7N9me-PdUXb_qbiXfQrwg276h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMm2Q--EExUku7CTCzKNyMH0hEliUczfEKBZS_B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNg6TvWs02xOsYJ1eeln5gdSBUHyzq2PxBq14O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh8zUosBZ0xYNbv3Z7OjEz_q4Aex5raqIna29g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAYAJxekWjcbZWujcxvOO_3dYux5vSEs-oqi69=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYCi11mshmYnQpnup2r-c9MYoAuV5CQRmnu9Xr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5zs-bIiaZ3WNUhUbdo7gWusbiLyTHszM6HAQD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf0-pLy3LXoV2cQIIt9q74V0L5Ecj-CCOrtLo0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy2vBNkxXM88EcuBUWm0gTo7gZ-KsXCv6Rf1Qx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXrXkJW9nXE5yd8-fSvHZY2F2s6jC9dUk7Y3b9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCnA6EE4366ym749Xhw8QfkTfJOe1VnafcRf_n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

< review>
OUE Skyspace offers an alluring view of Los Angeles from the heart of the city. After purchasing tickets, we took the elevator to the top. We slid down the famous glass slide that drops one floor down. The slide is a separate ticket that you purchase at the top floor.

There is a photo/Instagram area at the outside balcony. The view is beautiful any time of the day, but viewing sunsets from up high is an exquisite experience.</review>

Bird's eye view of the LA downtown. The slide is really fun, the deck is a must visit spot in LA. The view is undoubtedly breathtaking. The pano display, photo booths were OK. Wish they had a coffee shop alongside of the bar.<//review>

Absolutely amazing views of Los Angeles! Would highly recommend! Very friendly staff and clean environment. Neat gift shop area as well. The wait can get a little excessive during peak visit times. Also a little pricey unless you use the LA Go pass. If your in town for any amount of time and seeing a lot around LA get the pass. Its worth it.< /review>

<review>We went up Skyspace to watch the sun go down over Los Angeles and we were not disappointed  and it was not as busy I thought it would be.
You can have a drink up there which was quite affordable and nice.
I did go on the ride which I would say was just Ok and personal I don't think it's worth the extra price on admission.
But if you want great views this is the place to go.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPR_CdjU3jLjqX3YWGZlI9knFCNrOuCS_60Cp2d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_XUl9mnJEywG_zfUoVvvmYK3_3TixzueEClev=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI3xHaySKfRXpdtPFESo5INVGGf28oLFFNvBgv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7ruZkIhRs0V6YuXYFniCxKufHUtdQcR3N0ek5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPxkvyf9PR7zv0qhwzOMjf02fRRdELj3DN1D98=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOh9VuFStz_BbNoPi9KiJZyBTDQ6n1quGNAA9lx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDdYnYq7Z_swdd8PbX-td-E2rmxv81bzw8xjrC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaegLzKIxSHdBDEZIREvW0wpnTgB1L7p3lRXU0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpXb5wvSeacn6LmaneGlo56XGSKmjlBJnEuxCZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJc0JEyMTW3Hu3uPjKy5cJgjq6rGLQWow9wtdZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMApPKFeyP6nkvVItoBBth9Rjs06LqCO-62NOA6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Love this place! Not only are the views amazing but there is a small museum before getting to the top. Slide is $8 and a cool experience. Drinks are pricey but come on your high above in the heart of LA.< /review>

<text>I had a fun time here. From the package I got I was able to take a photo and the ride down the slide. The chicken I ordered was alright, I loved their cookie options. The vibe was chill but it was apt of people on line but the wait wasn’t terrible. A young lady gave me two extra tickets for the slide but i gave it away for someone else to try because I was leaving. They also have some cool things to do there like writing on a bored and listening to songs in a little studio etc</text>< Pics>

<text>I went on a cloudy day so the view wasn’t as nice. Employees are nice but there isn’t much to do. I would say this it is nice for about an hour and that’s it. Great photoshoot spot though!<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
Not much to do for the money. The experience was unique, but far too expensive for what you get. If you do it once, that's enough. If my daughters were not really excited to do the slide, I would have turned away when I learned the price. It's a unique experience, but it's definitely a tourist trap. If you value money, you should stay away from this place. It would be a relaxing place to read a book for the locals during the off-season if there was some sort of  small membership fee.<//review>

<review>Cool place to check out when in LA. Search for any specials to avoid paying full price as they are usually up to 50% off.

We had no queues when we visited and went straight up. The first lift takes you to level 58 where you find some information and videos about LA. You then get to the second elevator and end up on level 72. This is where the viewing decks are. You also get a chance to ride the short slide on the outside of the building but it’s a very short ride and you don’t actually see all that much as you’re sitting on a mat which blocks the view all the way down to the ground. Not sure it’s worth the extra money but we did it anyway.

There’s a cafe up there as well if you get hungry. They sell different kind of tickets, some allowing you to get up there more than once on the same day if you want to take in both the the daylight and night views.

Now you could drive up to the observatory and get a great view there instead but if you’re down town then this is well worth the money especially if you can score the tickets cheaper online.

Tickets do not give you the right to go up on a particular time. If it’s busy then you may be given a specific time slot instead but we had no such problems.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful view, really neat place to visit, makes for some awesome photo opportunities. There is a clear slide way up on the 70th floor, attached to the side of the outside of the building. I think it’s $8 and takes you down one floor. I did not have the guts to go but my friend did because she isn’t afraid of heights. I couldn’t get past being able to look down at the street so far below. It was still really cool to see. There is seating at an outdoor space and inside which also has a bar.<//Text>

Fun to see. Very touristy. Don't assume if you buy a slide ticket online that you don't have to wait in line!! I bought 2 slide tickets and picked a time. We showed up at that time and the attendant told us the time meant nothing. We had too many plans for the day to wait 45 min to go down a 15' slide. Waste of money - no refunds!!

I rate it a 4 out of 5 because the view was amazing. It's worth seeing, but be aware of the rip off slide and tourist traps.<//Review>

<Text>What an amazing experience. We went at the end of March and there was no line and when we got to the top it was more than just a touristy sightseeing expedition. It was relaxed, there were couches for you to sit on while you enjoy the macnificent view and even a bar. Definitely a must! They offer a "slide about the city" and although I am happy I did it it just doesn't last too long and I expected a little more of a thrill.<//Text><user_name>Tanitia van der walt<//user_name><resp>None</resp><rating>5</rating>< Time>

This place is set up like a little attraction with a lot of extra experiences. You can get your photo taken, visit the gift shop. All of that is nice but the most important thing is the view. I recommend you visit just before sunset cause it's breathtakingly beautiful. A bit expensive, but there are tons of ways to get discounted tickets.< /review>

Loved the place. Ride was a flavored topping. The view of city was beautiful. It is a wonderful city with wonderful people and lot of tourists. Nice place to do people watching and being a instagrammed famous. The night i went it was full moon so the place looks more beautiful with moon light.< /text>

Don’t miss this opportunity when you are in Los Angeles. See the sunset! We were surprised that up there they had a relatively cheap salad and it was delicious too! Great pictures, great impressions. Book upfront and you can skip the waiting lines. They have angel wings up there.<//review>

<Review>It's really worth going to if you want to see LA in a way most people will never see. Lots of people taking pictures and a line that grows and shrinks to the take pictures by the wings. But other areas are easier. It's really a once in a lifetime opportunity to view the city. It's worth the price.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>OUE Skyspace LA brings to life unparalleled, 360° views on California's tallest open-air observation deck, nearly 1,000 feet above Downtown Los Angeles. Experience the Skyslide, a 45-foot, fully enclosed, 1-1/4" thick all glass adventure landing on the exterior of the iconic US Bank Tower. On your way to the top, engage with an array of technological features on the 54th floor, highlighting LA's cultural attractions.
Excellent opportunity to view the city sites (Hollywood sign, Dodger Stadium, etc.). You can chill out on couches outside, seating and tables inside as well as food and beverages. We had a nice lunch break and were amazed by the good variety of choices you have even for vegan food. We had some delicious salads good portioned and cooled off with a cold beer while enjoying the panorama. Excellent location!</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9<//gmap_id>< pictures>

The LAPD casually circled the building in their chopper, waving down at us. Amazing place to get those extra instagram pictures. They got refreshments and a bar, extremely friendly and nice personnel. So if you like heights and instagram, this is definitely for you.</Review>< pictures>

I really enjoyed by time at Skyspace. There are so many different things to do throughout the levels including singing in a sound booth. I did expect the slide to be a little bit longer, but it was still really awesome to be outside of the building so high up. It also ends in a very cool outdoor patio and when you go inside there is a bar! The view is absolutely worth the trip and I highly recommend.<//Text>

<text>California’s tallest open-air observation deck and a must-see destination for panoramic, 360-degree views of Los Angeles. Located nearly 1,000 feet above the city at the iconic U.S. Bank Tower in Downtown L.A., OUE Skyspace L.A. honors the culture, community and people that make Los Angeles unlike any city in the world.
The highlight of OUE Skyspace L.A. is the Skyslide, a first-of-its-kind outdoor glass slide that’s attached to the exterior of the U.S. Bank Tower. The Skyslide is 45 feet long, about four feet wide and made entirely with 1.25-inch glass. Visitors will glide from the 70th to the 69th floor of the U.S. Bank Tower and see Los Angeles in a way that few will ever experience.
Such a great experience being here!</text></record>

This is a really cool spot. But be sure to confirm the weather before you go (if it's cloudy/hazy, the views are very limited). But either way....try the slide. It was a 3 second blast!</text>

< Review>
Visited on a Monday night and there was no line or barely anyone there. The views of nighttime LA were beautiful. I was not faced by the slide at all, it is a short ride. But others there felt different, including someone in my party, who was very much heart-pumping thrilled by it and struggled to take the plunge. Before you go on the slide they give you a ticket to check out your photo online later (and pay them more money). We had 2 drinks (rum and coke) and it was $30 dollars!<//Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>I would have enjoyed OUE Skyspace more if it was wrapped all around the US Bank Tower and I got to slide all the way down...oh! And let me use my phone to capture the moment I go down the mini slide. You guys wanted me to pay an arm and a leg for a 5 second ride.

Make sure you get there early to allow yourself time to use the restroom. We did get there early but was made to go back to the end of the line after we checked in BUT had to use the restroom. The GODS were not watching over us that day. (Total eye roll)

The best part of my short slide event is that there is a bar with actual glass stemwares rather than the plastic ones you would get from other establishments in the Tower. The bartenders were delightful and charismatic.

I'm thankful to be able to experience it with my niece and her fiancé. They definitely made the Colette Miller Wings look like angels.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHG1fUyMmZbFSkmPSAAejaPVx7OuvrTHDA7WMH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHHfEht--WupFApWfvXi59UduVmH66W_5Nc7Q0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpTD8w4WwD9foSxP22JR1wQ9SNz57_RUnFH7c4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFoiVsy-pcI_jyfO9FSpxJsMOvXF8ab13xu6Lh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWF37Fin6x9RmiihvuG-h8BKY_fqB8v56mLwpA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuLGujbJDZ7DWMtUqyP4BhbAWoo294MM_55wIv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0jeRb1_BJ7v6owsilFXWf1_H89A40Ub8kpyuf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeD8hXX7wIvucvxn7Q0StamJ0kQWs3TP7NJRZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Really great view from the top. Didn't go down the slide because it is extremely short and didn't seem worth it. Some staff were very friendly, and some really weren't. There are comfortable seating areas and a nice bar. You get to stay there all day!< /Text>

Good place to go for a first date. The glass slide was making me anxious, exciting and disappointing in that order. The bar was pretty convenient and unexpected. The way up was interesting especially with the singing booth. Tons of picture ops.<//text>

21$ per person for a nice 360 panorama view, lounges inside and outside, bar, inside dj, a little museum, interesting facts and more. One of the best places I’ve been to in LA for such an affordable price. You can spend there almost entire day, read books, enjoy great company, have fun with friends and etc. Will come here again for sure.

P.S. we didn’t take the SkySlide or whatever the slide called, because it was pretty late and it’s only around 20ft long.< /review>

If you can have fun VERY QUIETLY it would be a five star, but the mean neighbors who don't seem to understand how a playground is used really wreck the whole experience. And the lady taking pictures of us was definitely on the creepy side and really upset my nine year old. After repeatedly trying to get my four year old not to scream on the descent, I had to drag her away screaming because she wanted to keep sliding.< /Text>

First, we need to buy a ticket $25 (online or indoor). You will have discount if you have student ID, or your group have more than 10 people.
Second, get in line to go in the elevator. It was fun tho.
Third, when you go in to the top, there are many fun things to do. For example: take pictures with the big screens, or with the wings themes (2 wings at 2 different side).
Many available seats out side, that you can enjoy the weather. If you're lucky, you can see the helicopter greetings you in the morning.
Parking: $15 a day in the garage.
I will come back in the night time one day.</Text><gmapID>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9<//gmapID>< time>

Awesome place. I was really cool to go at night. I bought tickets to go on slide. But i chickened out. The worker joked that kids do it multiple times all day and I had nothing to worry about. Still a wuss tho< /review>

Amazing view and amazing LA’s attraction. It fees like we were visiting Empire State build of New York. This is one of the best attraction in LA. And the most amazing part was the ride from top floor. It was little adventurous and you had loads of fun.
The view was breathtaking , you can see Whole LA especially at night. Thats one of the place which really great for selfies and picture.
The patio is meant to have a great time with your lived one along with your choice of drink from their bar but dont take it sip n sit package.
Also, try to get tickets from group on, you will get the better deal.
I highly recommend this place to visit if you are in LA< /text>

You can really take some nice shots here, and enjoy the view. The slide is nothing special honestly, it's very short, so I wouldn't recommend it. On a clear day, you can see the Hollywood sign. Drinks are also fairly cheap here ($5 beer), and you can stay as long as you like, so it might be a good idea for having a drink while you're at it.< /review>

<review>very suggestive place, characterized by futuristic and very particular architectures, almost unique.
parking spaces everywhere for those who want to travel by public transport.
in the area you can also find excellent dining options and good Italian cuisine, with Italian espresso, and it's not a small thing.

I went for a company party the food was good and the venue was awesome. They have a bar down stairs and the clear slide was cool. Also the view of Los Angeles is something else.< /Text>

Very fun walk through and then the view at the top is very cool. They added the turf which wasn't there the first time I visited. I like that touch! People were sitting on the ground, the couches, hanging out inside. It was very relaxing. I came on a Saturday and had no idea that there were live performances. I personally did not enjoy that. It was super loud and killed my vibe. The first time I visited, I spent 2 hours just lounging outside on the patio, getting snacks and drinks throughout and enjoying the scenery. Everyone was being quiet and allowing everyone to enjoy it. This time, it was very loud so everyone was being loud. I went so I can let my 1 yr old daughter just run around and there were too many people to let her do that.< /text>

<review>This is a very touristy but fun place to check out.  On your way up there’s a few touristy ‘fun facts’ stations with info about LA, a place to get your photo taken, and some interactive features like looking down an old elevator shaft that’s coated by lights and mirrors (see pictures).  After the touristy museum  section you take another elevator up to the sky space.  I’d start off with the slide which takes you down one floor into the viewing deck.  The slide is quick and gives a good view but it’s over in about two seconds.  I recommend using the interactive features on the walls that are located inside.  You can learn a lot about different areas of LA.  It’s overall a little pricey and designed for tourists, but it is a cool view and good way to learn about LA.  I recommend trying it once for the novelty of it if you’re into that kind of thing.<//review>< Pics>

Incredible place if you want a full view on all Los Angeles Downtown it's where you need to go. At OUE Skyspace LA you can take the Skyslide it's a slide above the void or sit in front of this view with a cookie. All its for about $ 30< /Text>

Bought the tickets for the Sun+Stars Experience cause it really is worth the price in the end. You get to enter twice at anytime that you prefer on the day that you bought the tickets for. And the slide is also included in this ticket as well, which is a huge plus! The staff are super nice and let you know on what's going on. I had left my sunglasses as security when going up at first and thought I had lost them forever. But I was able to check with them back at the front to get them back, which is awesome! The experience of seeing LA both in the daytime and nighttime is so beautiful.<//Review>

Beautiful city views for a sunset and the curry night lights! We received a two for one special because we went on a rare day it was raining in LA. Didn’t discourage us from sitting out on the upper level patios!</Text>

The views of LA are nice but it’s $25 per person just to go up the elevator. It’s an additional $8 to ride the slide. (It was cheaper in Tokyo than this.. kinda ridiculous)

Needless to say I didn’t do the slide cause I’m cheap lol.

But views were great. I’d go during sunset though. If you go during the day you Can go back at night time for an “upgrade” fee of $10 each ticket.<//text>

It' cool but the slide is only 1 level. I think this is hyped up way more than it deserves. Beautiful views though.< /Review>

Great place to visit during sunset. The mountains looked amazing with the sunset. But other than that it was an OK but not exceptional experience.< /review>

I like viewing from the top of these towers because you really get to see a different perspective than just on ground level. We went on a day it wasn't busy luckily. Paying like 8 dollar's for the slide is a bit much but I understand why they do it. The slide was fun, trying to enjoy every viewpoint on the slide is almost impossible. Afterwards was fun too looking through the telescope at the Hollywood sign. When we went the forest fires was pretty bad so we saw all the smoke and planes go by. Other than that we had fun.</Text>

The view was very nice as well as all the seating that was available. The glass slide was very short and was good but I don’t think I’d pay to go again. There wasn’t really anything else to do once you’re up on the viewing deck. They do offer AARP and military discount.< /Review>

So I took my girlfriend here and we both had an experience of a lifetime I've never been that high off the ground I was pretty nervous but once you're there it's very nice and not  I'm scary as it seems you really can see for miles and miles The view was amazing not to mention they have a bar of their and plenty of seating  Can't wait to go back with more my friends</Text>

<userid>112921936601761864896<//userid><Review>Basic tickets were $25(did not include glass. Slide). Parking garage directly across street.

IMPORTANT TIP: have your ticket validated at the skyspace counter for parking. There are signs in the parking garage for this but none at skyspace. I was very angry at having to pay $35 for parking, thinking my ticket was proof I was there. Figured it would be validated by an actual person at garage but it's all automated. Skyspace, you need to have a sign at your desk about validating tickets. If you are there for under 3 hours, your parking fee in the garage is $8.
Back to the experience. 2 floors, one is interactive by downloading an app which did not work for me. You're not missing much though.
View on top is great, you can also see the Hollywood sign. We were asked to leave early as there was a private event we were unaware of when we purchased tickets. We were not very happy about this. Visiting from NJ, was unable do the tower another day.
Bar on floor with light food and snacks. Lounges and chair to relax and enjoy the view inside and outside, and of course 2 pairs of wings for photo ops.
Would reccomended this place even with all the issues.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
A unique activity to do as a local or visitor. Gorgeous city views from the 70th floor. Maybe a snack or drink at the top. A very lush lounge to rest and soak in the LA sun and oversee all it has to offer. The slide was very disappointing which was the length of a playground slide and didnt move as fast but the views and gorgeous lounge make up for it. Highly recommend coming to see and just chill out for a moment.<//Review>

Excellent place to see bird view of LA. It is especially beautiful during sunset. Skyslide is also worth a try and they will take picture for you. The photos are kind of expensive, 27 for 2 photos and 8 for each extra photo.<//Text>

It was so fun. I wish you can do the slide multiple times but you only get 1 try. The only thing I did not like was their visitor's parking. It is almost 30 dollars. Way too expensive.</Review>

Going up 71 floors in Downtown LA can be quite the experience. It's the only place in the city that can give you a top down perspective of the LA skyline and it can be incredibly awe inspiring. Unfortunately there is not much else to experience once your at the top. The glass slide is a small short section that doesnt provide the thrill you would imagine the space would have been better served by a glass floor observation deck giving guest prolonged exposure to the extreme height.< /Review>

Worth one visit to get a top view of La La Land. Amazing if you pay a visit post sunset for the glittering city views. Must try the sky slide, though a very few seconds of the slide but if you like heights it gives a nice chill sliding from 70th floor to the 69th.<//Text>

Plan ahead and check for the sunset time for the you’re going, so you get to see the daytime view, sunset, and nighttime view. Can be quite cold after sunset, so a jacket might be good. They also have a lounge bar up there, the slide is fun as well if you’re not afraid of heights (it’s less scary once it gets dark).</text>< response>

Awesome place in the US Bank Building to see the city. If you come at night, the lights from the urban sprawl will take your breath away, if the initial intense feeling of vertigo doesn't. Fun fact, it's in relative walking distance from little Tokyo, in case you find yourself there.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I really enjoyed spending time up here. We purchased the deal that came with a wine and cheese platter. The view was awesome and we stayed for 2-3 hours relaxing and chatting. The slide is very very short. It was definitely over way too fast. This isn't something I would do again but it is definitely worth it to go once!! :)<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Its best to get the groupon for this. To save money and skip the line. The skyslide is pretty short like 15 seconds its over. And the camera shots from the slide is trash. There is alot of la memorablia and the ig worthy shots on the rooftop is gorgeous night ans day. Go for photos and date nights.< /Text>

Little bit pricey and the slide is super short but this is a once in a lifetime type of opportunity.  The view is incredible and the building itself is beautiful.  Tip, get a meal at Grand Central market and take the angels flight.  It's only $1 and its almost across the street.</review>

<text>This observation deck provides very good views of Los Angeles.  It features a a glass slide 1,000 feet above ground called the Skyslide.  It also has a bar where you enjoy your drinks while sitting with the amazing views of DTLA.< /text>< Pictures>

Worth one visit to get a top view of La La Land. Amazing if you pay a visit post sunset for the glittering city views. Must try the sky slide, though a very few seconds of the slide but if you like heights it gives a nice chill sliding from 70th floor to the 69th.< /text>

You get nice views of l.a, they have free tours with awesome and knowledgeable guides and there is plenty to chairs to relax in. Great place where you can spend the afternoon if you want. Plus two pairs of Collette Miller angel wings!</review>

<text>Everything went as fast and smoothly as possible. I honestly loved the view more than the slide itself. I don’t think it’s worth paying for the slide. When you slide down, you don’t even look down or outside. You’re so focused on sliding than you are on your surroundings. Just buy the ticket to go to the floor but not the slide. Not worth it in my opinion.
You’re just wasting money on the slide that you only slide down on for a few seconds. If it was a longer slide, I would have given it a 5.<//text>< rate>

The view is actually pretty nice. Plan ahead and check for the sunset time for the you’re going, so you get to see the daytime view, sunset, and nighttime view. Can be quite cold after sunset, so a jacket might be good. They also have a lounge bar up there, the slide is fun as well if you’re not afraid of heights (it’s less scary once it gets dark).< /Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>An incredible view for sure. There are two floors accessible to guests. The sky slide leads you from one from to the next. So do some stairs.

You can purchase refreshments, ice cream. Snacks and pictures taken of you during your visit.

The slide is kinda cool, my son, 6 , enjoyed it and wanted to do it again. My daughter , 4 , was too young for it , she didn't want to go on it anyway as it scared her.

I went down the slide. Eh. Nothing special. Of you're afraid of heights or have a fear of the slide giving away, you may enjoy it. There's  a line for it as well. I would have loved for it to have extended for at least a few floors.

The only advantage of paying $30 for the view os the outdoor deck/patio area. There is still glass in front of you, however you are outdoors. This is where the slide leads to as well as a few doors on the bottom floor.  Once again. Great view. Kinda romantic. Still over priced though.

Do yourself a favor. Go to 71 and above. Sit at the bar. Enjoy some drinks. Still have an amazing view. Even higher.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPK_gXxSZJyW_7ihqoKPM8ko56hPILPdzD9ZQWw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQiPKog1Ia_52vPspJtKQMDRXXxmoTzRdtKI5t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZd5JXNoa5rQvwM5JHVL3FWwgHK9-s8uHozGtq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaqavsnVYbEKQ23e6k7lBarxNsPEcn5T4b-Da0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPw7uySC0UJCP6nJ3fGV_eBOTdCEGzXj8WPZ-L8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdg5P_tpUACy6PjYH7KyYg_fUHVOp-KLKUoFEV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

A typical tour would take you up to 2 hours. The place is pretty chill to hang out with few friends. A perfect place if you are into photography. The best time to visit this place would be right before 2 hours from sunset. You can take your own food and drinks too. They have food and drinks above too. The best part of this place is the slide. It was scary for me but at fun at the same time. The angel wings photography is the best part of this place. Also if you buy tickets through Groupon you may get it a little cheaper.<//text>< Pictures>

Really cool place to experience and check out if you are in LA. The views are pretty amazing from the top. Recommend for hanging out and relaxing. You can also rent the space out for parties and events.<//Text>

We came here to catch the sunset and glad that we did. The views were beautiful, it was great to see it during the day and then night. There's a bar inside, we didn't do the slide.< /review>

It's true about the cardboard -- luckily there were some clean pieces we found at the end of the slides. There were a couple of other couples there, so it was really chill. Joe thinks the right one gives you a little bit of air time. ;)< /review><name>Jon Rocy<//name>< pics>

When you are not open during Covid why it is showing as OPEN. Please change, when I entered in parking space and found this is not operational, you still need to pay 4$ to parking fee. Don’t waste your money. Don’t go now.< /text>

There is alot of la memorablia and the ig worthy shots on the rooftop is gorgeous night ans day.

Wonderful place to view the city of Los Angeles. The glass slide is not that scary especially if you're trying to focus on how to keep yourself balanced while sliding. There was a senior citizen who was able to go on out of her wheelchair and had her own special sled to slide down.<//Text>

68.00 dollars for 2 adults so if you don’t have it to blow aka waist go somewhere else. With that being said there are some nice views and the slide was fun but short.

This place is awesome! I went at night on a Thursday and there was hardly anyone there which made for an amazing experience. The views are incredible - the lights go on forever. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I went down the slide too - it's worth the extra money. Very romantic place - a great place to bring a date.</review>

The view is actually pretty nice. Plan ahead and check for the sunset time for the you’re going, so you get to see the daytime view, sunset, and nighttime view. Can be quite cold after sunset, so a jacket might be good. They also have a lounge bar up there, the slide is fun as well if you’re not afraid of heights (it’s less scary once it gets dark).< /text>

I got the package that includes the slide and a visit to the bar with a champaign bottle. The whole experience was pretty good for the money. However, the slide looks like a 2-second slide from one floor to the next one so nothing exciting besides the view which you can still experience without the slide. Be prepared to be ripped off by the parking structures around. The one recommended by the website is supposed to be $8 but turns out it was valet parking only. The structure right next to it was $40 for less than 4 hours.</review>

<Text>Going up 71 floors in Downtown LA can be quite the experience. It's the only place in the city that can give you a top down perspective of the LA skyline and it can be incredibly awe inspiring. Unfortunately there is not much else to experience once your at the top. The glass slide is a small short section that doesnt provide the thrill you would imagine the space would have been better served by a glass floor observation deck giving guest prolonged exposure to the extreme height.<//Text>< user_name>

It' cool but the slide is only 1 level. I think this is hyped up way more than it deserves. Beautiful views though.<//Review>

If you come at night, the lights from the urban sprawl will take your breath away, if the initial intense feeling of vertigo doesn't. Fun fact, it's in relative walking distance from little Tokyo, in case you find yourself there.</review></record>

This is a perfect place to view the LA skyline. It’s a must visit if you are in LA. A typical tour would take you up to 2 hours. The place is pretty chill to hang out with few friends. A perfect place if you are into photography. The best time to visit this place would be right before 2 hours from sunset. You can take your own food and drinks too. They have food and drinks above too. The best part of this place is the slide. It was scary for me but at fun at the same time. The angel wings photography is the best part of this place. Also if you buy tickets through Groupon you may get it a little cheaper.< /Text>

I was pleasantly surprised with this experience. There was a long line to ride the slide but there was an amazing view while we waited. They have a pretty nice bar as well and a few viewing areas that were just incredible. I would definitely recommend coming here because the views themselves are pretty amazing, and the slide was pretty fun.<//Review>

It is one of the most recognizable skyscrapers in the Los Angeles skyline, it has had many names.  Now it's called U.S.  Bank Tower and that's what is destroyed in Independent Day.
It was concluded in 1989 after 2 years of work and is still the third tallest skyscraper in all of California.
In 2014, the U.S.  Bank Tower was purchased by Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd. (OUE) which made numerous interventions on the building, including the construction of an observatory, a restaurant and a sky slide, a 13-meter transparent slide that allows to throw yourself into the open directly on the lower panoramic terrace.  Take some time to visit it because inside, before going out on the terrace, there are a lot of mini attractions that tell its story and some information about the city, from cinema to the sports world.

OUE Sky Space, alta circa 300 metri, con veduta a 360° su tutta la città.
È uno dei grattacieli più riconoscibili nello skyline di  Los Angeles, ha avuto molti nomi. Adesso si chiama U.S. Bank Tower
ed è quello che viene distrutto in Indipendece Day.
Venne concluso nel 1989 dopo 2 anni di lavori ed è tuttora il terzo grattacielo più alto di tutta la California .
Nel 2014 la U.S. Bank Tower fu acquistata dalla Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd. (OUE) che ha fatto numerosi interventi sull’edificio, fra cui la costruzione di un osservatorio, di un ristorante e dello....  sky slide, uno scivolo trasparente di 13 metri che permette di lanciarsi a cielo aperto direttamente sulla terrazza panoramica inferiore. Prendetevi del tempo per visitarla perché all’interno, prima di uscire sulla terrazza, ci sono un sacco di mini attrazioni che raccontano la sua storia e alcune informazioni sulla città, dal cinema al mondo sportivo.</Review>< Rating>

An incredible view for sure. There are two floors accessible to guests. The sky slide leads you from one from to the next. So do some stairs.

You can purchase refreshments, ice cream. Snacks and pictures taken of you during your visit.

The slide is kinda cool, my son, 6 , enjoyed it and wanted to do it again. My daughter , 4 , was too young for it , she didn't want to go on it anyway as it scared her.

I went down the slide. Eh. Nothing special. Of you're afraid of heights or have a fear of the slide giving away, you may enjoy it. There's  a line for it as well. I would have loved for it to have extended for at least a few floors.

The only advantage of paying $30 for the view os the outdoor deck/patio area. There is still glass in front of you, however you are outdoors. This is where the slide leads to as well as a few doors on the bottom floor.  Once again. Great view. Kinda romantic. Still over priced though.

Do yourself a favor. Go to 71 and above. Sit at the bar. Enjoy some drinks. Still have an amazing view. Even higher.< /review>

very fun activity for couples or friend groups. TONS of photo opportunities. went on the slide, it wasn't worth the wait in my opinion. the real fun is taking pictures up there! bring a jacket, it gets chilly up in the sky</review>

One of the best experiences!
Our even was a Company's New Year Event, I was very nervous and stressed out.
However, the Organization of our event was much easier with our event sales specialist. we had a great communication, they answer emails and calls as soon as possible. I like millions of questions and she was always happy to answered, always very patient, professional and friendly.
The venue was great has a great view, it is very modern and perfect!
Food was delicious and I just heard complements!
Service, was exceptional! a lot of help and every server / bartender were very friendly and professional, they help you to enjoy your event, you just have to worry about  to enjoy and have fun.
Every personnel, very friendly, professional and happy to assist you, what else can you ask!
I am so thankful for all the help provided.
The final results for this event was a result from a great team work and our Company’s President and CEO were so Happy and Amazed how all this turned out.
Thank you Again everybody at OUE SKYSPACE for helping us to have a great time!</Text>

The slide is very short so don't blink but the view isn't bad. The bar is nice and my husband was still able to catch the Lakers game while we checked out the view of the city.</Text>

< Review>
Really like this OUE Skyspace LA, this is not like other observation desk, as here is more relaxing area for visitors.
Came here during the afternoon and it's not full at all.  You can have lot of space to take photos.
They also have a nice view and restaurant, so you can seat near the window and enjoy the food and wine together with great view</Review>

Not the fanciest observatory but still nice to visit if you are around.</review><user_name>Ling</user_name>< Rating>

Great time! You slide down 1 slide.
The line is NOT too long.
Do not bring a BIG purse.
You need to find PARKING near by.
Price with the slide $68 for 2 people
Maybe pricey but it is an experience !</Text>

I had never heard of the place but Google suggested it so I went. It was fun, the "sky slide" is one floor so it's very quick, but they have a lounge area that is excellent it's outside great views and comfortable seating. I'd absolutely go back on a slow day. Also I'd bring food, it'd be a perfect place for a picnic.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Awesome experience,  was worth it for sure. I recommend going at night,  the view of the city is much better.  Helpful staff guide you through the building with a few exhibits to see on the way.  Once you're up top, it is super chill and relaxing. If you're afraid of heights,  it is not too bad because there are many areas to sit and catch your breath.  You can buy snacks,  but there aren't many food options,  it would be nice if they added a restaurant up here.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_FhBfkDjZO_l3ZZpFkM1tvQNHK5yTcz36KDd_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB1-P5pAv4j2K8SqHo1EaVMlN63LN4doWZaBSX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpmMYmfn2mCsCby5SQjd2JUEIRDdWc_xVWEtmi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

I had some problems validating the parking and the manager arranged a refund. Still if you visit the skyspace they should have a cheap parking arrangement.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWIN6yHklrcBfDgb3opTUIhPRjNHXuDF1wgH0z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhZbTREJ_nM-pXCPbmal6neo2IZQYtWCmimxZD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE0o9mDVW6z7QHlw_APF0Hq1P4nObXChetGkHg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtRmsek71f8CXTIWkkOwOEvqxcjSxZ3FY3ySq7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>It was a wonderful way to spend Christmas with the family.  It is a great way to get a birds eye view of Los Angeles, and unlike the overhead view from a plane, you get a chance to soak in the view for a good long while.  Most all of the employees were solemn and disengaged,  hopefully it was only because they had to work on Christmas day.  Out of the approx 10 employees we encountered 2 were kind, helpful, and friendly and they both were in the gift shop.<//text>< user_id>

It's a great view but between smog and smoke it was tough to see far.   As for the slide it's this small acrylic looking box.  It's so short I'd say do it once just tip day you did it.< /Review>

The view from the 70th floor is incredible!!! This is the second tallest building in Los Angeles, but still offers the best view because of its circular roof.</Review>

<Text>The terrible layout, parking and various  elevators & security you have to go through is not worth the hassle  to get to the great views above Los Angeles. If you want to go I'd advise you to valet or park outside. Views are great  but a real tourist trap & difficult access.</Text>< Pics>

It’s LA version “Empire State Building”, so definitely you should give it a shot if u travel here. Sunset is a great time! You can go like one hour before sunset, so get bright daytime view of skyline DTLA, then enjoy the sunset and great night view after:) I didn’t give the Sky Slide a try, it’s just not scary at all for me, I am talking about this as I am a benjee jump and skydiving lover😉</text>

Ride nearly 1,000 ft. above Downtown LA to experience the city in a glass slide, and enjoy 360° views from California’s tallest open-air observation terraces.
Good for a one time visit.<//Text>

The expensive ticket (we paid almost $100 for three) was so worth the view and all the amazing photos we got. It’s the tallest you can get in Downtown LA and the 360 degrees view is stunning. Must go for anyone visiting LA.<//Review>

WHAT A VIEW!!! About $40 per person but sooo worth it! They have a glass slide on the 70th floor that you ride down to the 69th floor onto one of many outdoor patios surrounded by glass walls and adjoining a bar/lounge area indoors. Breathtaking views!< /Text>

Beautiful views are offered at the top. They also include some interesting facts and memorabilia on a couple of the floors you pass on your way up to the top. Makes the $25 entrance fee more worth it in my opinion. There is a full bar upstairs  and a variery of interesting food items that looked tasty despite being pre-packaged.</text>

Good for an experience, the actual attraction time is short you can stay there for a little longer, the slide is somewhat scary if you think how high it is, but the views are spectacular overall good experience !< /review>

<Name>Elio Raineri<//Name><review>One of the best places to see Los Angeles landscape. The ticket costs 25$ and you are able to visit three floors of the building. The first one has a huge 360 screen with time lapses of LA. The other two have a panoramic view of the city, a bar and a restaurant.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Great view, you can really bask into the glory of LA from east to west. in addition to the view you get some neat attractions inside the building. Great to check out.

< Review>
Very nice views of LA. You can even see the Hollywood sign and other famous places. The slide is optional for a few extra bucks. My gf did it and liked it. It only a few seconds and you are not allowed to film or take pics. I suggest you go during sunset since the views might be even better.</Review>

<Time>1556576639005<//Time><rating>4< /rating><Text>Would reccomend a visit to this building purely for the incredible views. We ended up staying here for a couple of hours because we were so exhausted from walking all day, and there were very comfortable sofas on the viewing deck. Also there were binoculars on the deck that were free to use which was fun. We did not go on the slide as it seemed very short, gimicky and not worth the money. There was a bar at the top that sold drinks and some nice looking food, as to be expected the prices were high, so if you're on a budget don't plan to eat here.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAYjh99C7vsAAwH59ERFlf5vnbpalouHcas8zG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

In my opinion, $33 is too expensive for a 5 second ride on a slide. That was really the only reason I went.
It was fun, had a nice view of LA, but I wouldn't go there again. At least not for that price. The ride is over before you get to embrace your surroundings...
Their gift shop is also disappointing. Not a lot of things and everything is overpriced.<//text>

<Text>If you can have fun VERY QUIETLY it would be a five star, but the mean neighbors who don't seem to understand how a playground is used really wreck the whole experience. And the lady taking pictures of us was definitely on the creepy side and really upset my nine year old. After repeatedly trying to get my four year old not to scream on the descent, I had to drag her away screaming because she wanted to keep sliding.< /Text>< user>

It was a nice place to get the city view. But make sure the weather is good to get a good view.</Text>

<user>108583227989088635801</user><name>Brigette< /name><text>Great tourist spot. Allows you to get a pretty good view of Los Angeles, from the area around you towards the Hollywood sign, the far East, and even more West. Plenty of picture filled journeys in this small spot. Take a breath, grab the blanket, and go down the slide. It's short, fun, and takes you to another area to explore and take pictures. Explore everything you can and relax, it's there to have fun.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating><Pics>None<//Pics>< time>

Good views of LA along with some lame museum-ish displays. They have a glass slide on the exterior of the building if you’re feeling brave. Beer on tap for $8.</Text>

<text>You can likely save $5 on the entrance tixjet up if you search online. From OUE's webpage they were offering $5off even when we went i.e. $20 + $1 fee. My friends seemed to get a 2 for $12 slide tix.. I bought a slide ticket up there for $8. Great views. The slide is ok.</text><user>101114008928961201143< /user>< username>

Nice place in LA down town to spend some time with your loved ones. You’ll get an awesome top view of the down town from the 72nd floor open top of this building. They also have a rooftop cafe so that you can enjoy some drinks or snacks.</Text>

This place is soo cool and fun. They have a whole history of LA and nice little area to walk thru so you can feel more connected and kind of have an idea of what you’re about to see when you see the view of LA.

They have an area where u can slide down and it feels like ur falling. I haven’t tried that yet but every time I see those people go down it looks like fun lol. They have a spot where u can buy souvenirs and a spot where u can buy food too.

My fav is just then open areas where u can take pics outside. It’s crazy to be viewing LA from so high and being outside. Obviously you’re surrounded by glass but it just feels amazing to view it and experience it like that. You’re surrounded by buildings. So beautiful.

I love going at night. If you go in the daytime, it’s also nice, but idk I just like it better at night.</Review>

<time>1552263602186< /time><Review>If your a tourist then this is the place for you. They have your famous "LA Wings"  up at the balcony. If your going up I suggest buying the tickets to the slide. Very worth the wait at the line. They have a bar and some over priced snacks.  I love views so 4 out of 5.<//Review>< username>

Excellent views of the city. The general admission will get you in and on the deck. There is a bar and lots of seating. There are areas to take pics and do some art on the touch screen monitors. It costs an additional $42 to go down the slide.</text>

The view was stunning here !
The way up to sky space was also interesting !
Atmosphere was excellent !

But the slide was too short !

Thought it would be better to set more lights around the slide so visitor can record their way down the slide !<//text>

The views here are really amazing. We enjoyed it best at night, but during the day was cool too. You have to try the slide to fully enjoy your visit. The setup and the staff here we're all very professional and it's very clear to understand what to do and where to go.< /text>

Exiting.  Beautiful view
We sat at the deck for a drink and  the view.

What a fantastic place to visit. We went a little bit before sunset so were there to see the sun stting. It was amazing. You have views of th ed whole city. It wasnt cold. And at that time it wasnt overly busy. Well worth visiting.< /Text>

Views from the top of the US bank tower are awesome. Bar staff was cool too, just wish the slide was longer than literally 3 seconds. Dont even have time to process the view below. Would only pay for the views again.< /Review>

<review>Fantastic view, especially at night. Clear skies allow you to bask in the scene that only LA can give. I'm sad that they forgot to give one of my group members their ticket for the slide therefore they didn't have a picture. Overall a good place to go.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

< Review>
A very beautiful place to visit. The views from the top are amazing. I went at a time when there was a lot of fog and smog but I could still see a lot for downtown and the surrounding LA area. The slide, although short, is very fun and scary. Especially if you have a fear of heights. The top deck was nice and offered a 360 view of LA from all sides of the building. There are some interactive exhibita on the 54th floor which are nice, but the main event is the top viewing deck at the 70th floor. Overall a fun experience.</Review>

<Review>In my opinion, $33 is too expensive for a 5 second ride on a slide. That was really the only reason I went.
It was fun, had a nice view of LA, but I wouldn't go there again. At least not for that price. The ride is over before you get to embrace your surroundings...
Their gift shop is also disappointing. Not a lot of things and everything is overpriced.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Had a great experience. I went with a group of five... 2 adults and 3 children. The activities were great and many opportunities for fun pics before you even get to the view. The view though was amazing and the children enjoyed the slide. Monica was very helpful and her customer service was superb....I will definitely be back<//Review>

Take your time, soak in the views on all sides. The best day to go, like any other vista point, is a day after it rains when the visibility is fantastic.</Text>< Pics>

Nice place to just chill and have a drink. Whether you want to be inside or out there's something for everyone. Plus I believe everyone should try out the small slide at least once.</review>

I was very impressed with the observation decks that this place offered. I went to the Sears tower in Chicago and had a blast with the view and observation deck but the outdoor seating areas at this location were a pleasant surprise. Plenty of seating and a full bar so that you can enjoy the view with a [insert your drink of choice] in your hand. The bartender was also super charismatic and remembered everyone's drinks when it came time for us to move on to round 2. My group did take the slide and it was a neat little experience but had I know that the view offered so much, I could have easily done without it. The slide is quite small and goes by so fast that you dont even really get a chance to soak in the view. The observation decks are way cooler and well worth the cost and trip, especially if purchased as a group package.< /review>

You can see all and relax with a cold nice beer and snacks, you get a 360 degrees view of the city .. only small little  detail that got me happy and disappointed  at the same time was getting compostable cups and not having a compost bin to dispose them properly so they got mixed with the trash :(<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

My wife took me here, and I thought it was a "balcony." Little did I know it was a skyscraper tour with lookout on the 74th and 91st stories with amazing LA views. We had a good time. Then a VIP area with big projector screens and couches opened up, and that made the day cooler.<//review>

Took some family members that were in town visiting.  It was a great experience.  Really beautiful view that you will not forget! Also, the slide was pretty fun. Definitely a great place to visit.<//Review>

<Review>Amazing view! You can see all and relax with a cold nice beer and snacks, you get a 360 degrees view of the city .. only small little  detail that got me happy and disappointed  at the same time was getting compostable cups and not having a compost bin to dispose them properly so they got mixed with the trash :(< /Review>< rating>

I really enjoyed spending time up here. We purchased the deal that came with a wine and cheese platter. The view was awesome and we stayed for 2-3 hours relaxing and chatting. The slide is very very short. It was definitely over way too fast. This isn't something I would do again but it is definitely worth it to go once!! :)<//Text>

<Text>It's one of those places that you know you're getting price-gouged, but you still feel you need to do it at least once.

- First, lower your expectations and note that you are literally just paying for the skyline views - and they ARE nice
- The slide is cool, but the ride lasts like 5 seconds - so it is over before you know it and you can't go through it again (without paying) which makes it difficult to truly enjoy the experience - I would say it is practically a gimmick
- The informational content is acceptable to read about, but when I was there recently almost everything tech-enabled was broken
- The glass can provide a glare that messes up photos, but it isn't bad if you know how to manage your camera
- There is a decent amount of comfortable seating</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Way to pricy for what it is...if you're Canadian expect to pay roughly 90 CAD$ for about 30-45 minutes of attraction. There's not much to do and you shouldn't go there when it's not sunny.<//text>

<review>The slide is super fun. The views are gorgeous! The apple flavored beer at the bar was the best. Savannah at the gift shop was very kind. Our pictures didn't come out right the first time so she gave us a pass to go and take them again. Would love to come back again!</review><Rate>5</Rate></record>

<text>Our skyspace is on the observatory deck on the 74th floor of down town building . You can get a 360 veiw of LA,you have to buy ticket for around 25$ each . Worth a trip. The entrance in from the second floor and you can reach climbing the stairs.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLwl6kLnHPZs8_APG5R7hDmX6VSAIC8Ft-ZR3c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv_I-FRcU4WW0u5rI7PIGdFEi-Zj7Y20ASssCZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Awesome views of the city with hardly any crowds at all! I went with a friend and we basically had the top floor to ourselves. The slide is not worth the price, but it was an experience. There is also a fun things to do along the way up to the slide. A large projection of yourself in a large bubble picture cam be manipulated. The is also a hole that goes down to what I assume is the ground floor which you can stand above. This a one time experience, but I recommend it.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9WiBjFLHMeSEKWkajjHbgarcWJtDQe7r19f1M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNcOhkqA07-k9K8hLGFfkCh4Bj7CWWOoUsZSyl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

This place is definitely a one and done tourist attraction. The slide is $8, like I said, also a one and done thing. The best part in my opinion isn't even the view. I personally think on the way up to the top of the building is the best part. The interactive experiences are really cool. There is a bar at the top and you can get little snacks like ice cream. The place in general including the bar isn't bad for the price. If it's your first time in the area, I would recommend this to really see LA!</Text>

A little pricey just for a view but...worth the trip.< /Text>

<Review>$1 for the slide this month. You can find a groupon offer and they have student discounts. I'd say if you can go during sunset to go! The view is pretty and you can sit outside and have a drink.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3-YP1qEkPuw25zYmoo63D0pAnKA63WMFhNDlu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

This is a great place for dates.  The beautiful view and ambience are worth the admission price...also I got discounted tickets on rush49 site.  Valet parking was $15...Pictures were $10 and there is a snack bar so bring cash.<//text>

Went for salsa dancing the place was very impressive! Epic 360 views of LA and very interesting modern present pop art staff was super friendly and were super on top of the ball (I left my jacket at the bar and staff brought it back down for me without having to trek back upstairs). The bar was super slow though I waited 15-20 mins to order drinks and the bar wasn't even that busy.<//review>

Great view of Los Angeles from the top. There are two viwing balconies, and you can take good pictures from there too.
There is also a glass slide, not too scary, which is fun but costs extra.
There is a lot of history about LA too on the way to the top. And several places where you can take photo like a red carpet background etc.
There is a place to eat on the top, so you can sit and enjoy for a while with a great view.</Text>

<Review>Excellent view over LA. This is the tower, that has been blowen away by the aliens in Independence Day.

Try the Sky-Slide, which is a slide made of glas at the outside of the building, about 300m above the ground. Even I did it, after a group of older ladies did it first. 5 Seconds of pure adrenaline!

Prices are affordable.<//Review>< Rate>

This place is very classy. You can come casual or bring the kids to experience Downtown LA like never before. I wouldn't suggest going on a extremely hot day. The view is magnificent! I would go again when it's not as hot.< /Text>

<Review>It's not worth the money: this place actually lives off the hype it enjoys about Instagram and its influencers. For two people about 50 USD just to get the view is pretty steep. The slide is a total flop: sliding down once for two seconds is not a special and lasting result. The bar sells quite expensive drinks with 90 percent ice and 10 percent juice / alcohol and co. Unfortunately it was a waste of money.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnl_q8PRAm5fnG7FMOVzvp9VTkaJPP6QqSxvPN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><rating>1</rating>< user_id>

Great all around  experince. Not just the slide but the tour. The slide is a little over hype, but the top of the building allows for speculate views and photos. The kids loved it (2. 5 and 10 years old)< /Text>

I need to come back and really experience this place.  We bought passes online a month in advance. Drove 2 hours to get there just to be turned down at the entrance due to a private event.  We didn't buy through a 3rd party website like the host thought. We bought direct from their site.  They refunded us which was good but the 1 star is because we didn't get a text, email, call, or anything to let us know to reschedule<//Text>

It's a welcoming place,great ambiance,a nice place to get a 360 deg view of the downtown la skyline,..plus a fun experience sliding on a glass slide from 70th floor to 69th floor...opening up to 2 view decks( observatory)...then chill at the beer garden bar with friends..you can order drinks and food..
A great destination for your visiting friend and family.< /review>

I really enjoyed going down the slide but I think it's a little spendy. I went on opening day and got a deal but I have seen the price and I'm not sure that it is worth it. But if you do go it's fun< /text>

<rate>4</rate><Text>It's definitely a cool place to check out.  Amazing views.  But working in tv/film I've been on location filming in high rises before so it wasn't anything life-changing.  $25 to get in...plus parking.  Everything is roped off in such a way that it's like a real exhibit...and of course you MUST exit thru the gift shop with over priced souvenirs.  Along the way they took a pic of us in front of a white screen (not green). We saw the pic later but didn't purchase it for $25....we took better pics with our cell phones from the observation deck.   Don't get me wrong..it's def a cool thing to check out if you wanna propose to someone or maybe even just look out over the city and contemplate life while watching planes fly over.  And if you have some extra money to spend..go for it.  But overall, it's pretty overrated.  I would totally pay $15..maybe even $20. But 25?  Plus 25 for a cheap looking CGI pic?  Plus parking?  Plus corralling you thru the gift shop at the end??  Typical LA tourist trap..with amazing views.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Awesome experience! Great views! The slide was a lot of fun, I did it even though I'm kinda scared of heights. You can enjoy the stunning views outside in the sun or inside in the AC. They have a little cafe up there. All of the employees was really nice and they made a really good experience for me and my wife. I would definitely encourage everyone to visit here at least once!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>Worth doing once. Really debated based on reviews, but it really is cool to do once. Go right before sunset and the view is phenomenal. Was not crowded at all when we went. And the slide is worth doing once as well. It is only one story, slow and simple, but pretty cool. My 9 year old loved it. Discounts available online or by showing your AAA card. Ignore the negative reviews... I think they were expecting Disneyland or something.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Great observation deck in downtown la. The outdoor viewing areas with couches are nice, giving you views right out towards the ocean and the Hollywood sign. The glass slide is cool but thought it was quite short. Definitely would be great place at sunset.< /Text>< pics>

<text>We passed by the building and saw a terrifying-looking plexiglass slide sticking out of the top of this skyscraper. My wife is scared of heights, so she suggested we try out the slide to help her overcome her fear. She ended up really enjoying it.

Neat place, cool outdoor viewing decks. Some great historic and interactive displays inside as well.

This place attempts to reach a wide age-group, and does well at it; there's something here for everyone to see.
A bit pricey for what you get, though. The price makes it more of a one-time thing, rather than a repeat-worthy trip. Less expensive tickets would make this place totally deserving of a 5 star review.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Loved my visit to Skyspace! The workers were really polite, attentive to questions and comments. Once up at the observatory deck you have an option of riding the slide or sitting either inside or outside to view the beautiful skyline. We went just around sunset and it is a site to see!<//text>

Great views of LA and amazing graffiti covered walls, it is a nice place to spend the evening, and it is not too crowded too.
The sky slide though, is one of those things that sounds a lot more amazing on paper, but not so much in real life. It's barely a 3 seconds slide, too short to take anything in. So, I feel it is mostly a pass.</review>

Really topped off our visit to downtown LA.  The view from the balconies was spectacular.  We took advantage of a group deal that included the glass slide and a drink at an average of $1 more than the general admission, so good value.  The slide was short but still a little nerve racking and fun.</text>

<text>I had my high school prom here and it was beautiful. The whole layout was perfect, the way the tables were arranged was exceptionally well. The view was absolutely amazing and the perfect spots to take pictures. The water fountain in the front was also a very good spot for pictures. The busers And the valets were extremely helpful and kind. I had an amazing time.<//text>< name>

It's a very beautiful attraction. You can see the city from one of the highest stories and there's something mesmerizing about seeing how large and beautiful the city is at night. The slide is something you do once just to see what it's like but it isn't very special. You're on a slide mat so you can't see under you which kind of eliminates the purpose. It's a nice place to go with friends and have a few drinks but I don't think I'd visit it again.</review>

The view form the top is amazing. I would say its a must visit place. Try to visit at night. They have good resolution binoculars installed at the top. Do look for Groupon coupon in advance for entry fees.< /Review>

The glass slide ride lasts literally about 3 seconds.
We did find the observation deck to be fairly nice with sofas for seating and readily available food and drinks.
Honestly, if it were more reasonably priced, I'd raise my rating.<//Review>< Pictures>

Beautiful Vista @ 360°! Nighttime display of lighted buildings stretching as far as the horizon shows the immensity of the city of the angels. Angel wings adorn one of the glass viewing walls just for those memory pix. Definitely designed for viewers to stay for longer than just a quick view, with an opportunity to slide down a slide along the outside of the building, and/or to grab a drink and a bite at the full bar with lots of seating. The walk through display of LA factoids may be fun for first time city visitors.</Text>

You take a couple elevators up the building, and along the way get to see some very interesting art, comedy skits and technology exhibits.  There is a pricey cafe and bar at the top of the tower.

I went for a special VR music adventure evening and I loved the space to move around and the two floors. As it was nighttime the view wasn't as good and the slide is certainly very quick, but I enjoyed the adventure and would recommend it if there's an event on for something different.</review>

<text>Not worth the price. Very limited space outside compared to number of people. Not a 360 degree view. Our tickets also in,crude the slides, when we finished there were no photo and they told us the camera was off.

Especially if you stay at the intercontinental hotel in downtown LA, don’t waste your time and money here as the rooftop bar at the Intercontinental is much better.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9<//Gmap_id><resp>None</resp><username>Mighty Thor< /username>< Date>

<Review>Hosted a meeting in this location and the group loved it!  Incredible views and the staff are amazing!  It was a touch on the expensive side but the experience, the food, and the service made it well worth the expense.< /Review></record>

<Review>Fantastic experience! The view is amazing except you can see the cloud of smog over L.A. parking is a nightmare. Find a lot of people to go with you so you can split the cost of Parking. The lot on Flower is the cheapest at a whopping $32. Good thing my GoCity pass included this attraction. Otherwise it wouldn't have been worth it.</Review><Name>Tracy Hock<//Name>< GmapID>

<review>Beautiful views from an epicenter vantage point. High enough to see the Pacific Ocean and the mountains to the north. It's a bit expensive for what it is considering that Spire 72 offers similar views along with bar service. This stop is at least a one time must.< /review>< Date>

The view is nice up top. You're paying for a slide which costs extra. Not worth it.

If you wanna see LA and maybe get a drink, then sure. But don't bother with the slide.<//text>

If you get a chance to see LA from tbis amazing city skyscraper, go do it!  You can just see it all from the top or pay a extra fee to take the see through glass slide outside of the building from the 70th floor to the 69th!</Review>

Was a great time and definitely would go again with different people. Would have preferred a longer slide and a cheaper fee for everything, but still awesome. For sure somewhere to go if you love a good view and relaxing for a while.<//Review>

<Review>Beautiful views of the city! Nice areas to get a drink and sit down to chat. The slide is short and small but worth the $8 to say you slid 1000ft above the city. Make sure to try the waffle place right outside the entrance.<//Review>< Rate>

Beer is overpriced and drinks are noodle stiff... but the views are amazing and the deck looks down on the deck of the InterContinetal. If you want the highest deck, this is it.<//text>

It was a great experience! And there were no lines when we went on a Friday afternoon. If I'd planned better I would've done the Sun and Stars package with the slide add on. I wouldn't buy the pictures they take of you on the slide because they come out so blurry and you can't really make out who's who normally but a few of our pictures were good. I think you're better off taking pictures of each other going down the slide from the bottom.</Text>

Had a great experience. I went with a group of five... 2 adults and 3 children. The activities were great and many opportunities for fun pics before you even get to the view. The view though was amazing and the children enjoyed the slide. Monica was very helpful and her customer service was superb....I will definitely be back<//review>

<Text>That elevator is impressive. You have to go through TSA to get board the elevator. Good bar up at the top. Great staff and cocktail options.<//Text>< Pics>

Nice View from the City, different that what you get from the Griffith Observatory.< /Review>

Place and view are nice however you can get great views from some hikes and the Griffith Observatory as well. If you don't have time and stay downtown consider this option. The idea of the slide is more exciting than the actual ride...< /review>

Great experience! Very fun and no more expensive than the other similar sites like Willis Tower where you walk out on the clear floor over the city in Chicago. The line moved fairly and the employees were very pleasant. You can buy tickets online from a third party and get a ticket that will take you to the top, one slide ride and a drink. The views were awesome and I highly suggest you try the experience.<//review>

<text>The view was phenomenal! There are two viewing platforms. One is at the bottom of the slide and the other on the opposite side of the building. Both also have the wing art for great photos. They is a cafe that is tourist attraction priced. The line moves quickly for the slide and you can spend a significant amount of time there.</text>< pictures>

The slide is super fun. The views are gorgeous! The apple flavored beer at the bar was the best. Savannah at the gift shop was very kind. Our pictures didn't come out right the first time so she gave us a pass to go and take them again. Would love to come back again!</Text>

Nice place to just chill and have a drink. Whether you want to be inside or out there's something for everyone. Plus I believe everyone should try out the small slide at least once.</text>

We got there a bit late. It took a little bit to find a parking lot and the entrance. When my wife and I finally got on top observatory it was amazing! We enjoyed the view and took photos and spent a good time though it was almost to their closing time. Worth coming once or twice more< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Loved our visit on a Friday evening!  Nice spot to appreciate the sunset if you plan it right!   The ride is short but you can make it as exciting as you want it to be. Bar experience was great and reasonably priced.  Live salsa band was a plus.  We bought tickets with promotional discounts in advance and all was breeze.  Side note: We Uber from about 20 miles south and it paid off, relieved us from the Parking hustle in LA :).</Text>< pics>

This place is definitely a one and done tourist attraction. The slide is $8, like I said, also a one and done thing. The best part in my opinion isn't even the view. I personally think on the way up to the top of the building is the best part. The interactive experiences are really cool. There is a bar at the top and you can get little snacks like ice cream. The place in general including the bar isn't bad for the price. If it's your first time in the area, I would recommend this to really see LA!</Review>

<Text>A definate must do if you're visiting, or live in the Los Angeles area. Easily the most amazing view you're ever going to see of the city. The sky slide is a fun little experience and there are interactive photo ops both inside and out on the observation decks. Light food, craft beer and cocktails are available and reasonably priced. The only thing I would say could use improvement is that the inside area of the observation level seems a little plain. The lighting is off or it needs a little more decor to set the vibe. You'll see what I mean when you're there. Have a blast though... this is definitely a place worth your time. Bring your camera!<//Text><Resp>None</Resp></record>

I would like to say it was a good experience to be able to see LA view at night for a fun short slide. I gave 3 stars because I think the ticket price is over price plus the parking price  was ridiculous expensive at that location ( night time ).< /Text>

<review>It's good view from up there but.. 2 things.. first: the slide it's pretty expensive for what it is and second: it's a bit overpriced in general. Other than that, is a good experience and you get to see hollywood sign from afar.< /review><time>1578633414605</time><user_name>Luis Manuel Tavarez<//user_name><rating>4< /rating>< user_id>

<review>Next time i will go when the sun is still out and explore the place more and hopefully visit the gift shop. My friend kept wanting to leave like a lame bcs he said he was scared. This place is amazing tho. I didnt do the slide bcs i rather do it during the day. Usbank tower views are unreal, you cant get anymore los angeles than that honestly. Its a recommendation to everyone to come here. Everything is stunning and well worth the $20. The wait was not bad and i went on a sunday night.< /review>< Pics>

Great views. If you want to have a better picture in the slide, do it during the day. I did it at night and you can't tell that you are sliding 1000 feet above downtown. And the views are great at day and night.< /text>

< review>
I have been here two days in this week for my travel, but I couldn’t enter neither of two days.
In my first visit, it was my fault that I didn’t check the time, I wanted to use my Go card All-inclusive, but Go card entrance is only allowed until 5:30.
Today I tried to get here again because it is my last day in LA, but unfortunately it is all closed because somebody reserved whole story.
I got a discount coupon for next visit, but it is valid only for this year so I think I wouldn’t make it.
Make sure if they close temporarily or not before you pay expensive DTLA parking fee.< /review>

<Review>OUE Skyspace LA is California's tallest open-air observation deck and the premiere destination for panoramic, 360-degree views of Los Angeles. OUE Skyspace LA is located on floors 2, 54, 69 and 70 of the iconic U.S. Bank Tower, nearly 1,000 feet above downtown Los Angeles.
Amazing views views of Los Angeles, with a glass slider also available. Must see if you live in, or are just visiting Los Angeles.< /Review>< Name>

Oh my goodness!!!! What a beautiful place!!! The views are amazing! The slide is exciting! Over priced in my opinion, nearly $100 for 3 people but I'd totally go again. I'm just in love with the views. Lots of seating space, fresh air, fun photo activities. They also have a very small snack bar with nespresso coffee, excellent coffee, and chips....< /Review>

The view is definitely breath taking! If you buy one of the maps they offer, you can use it to find all the popular places in LA. One thing that did bother me is the glass slide... It's a really really short ride, like 10 seconds maybe. Other than that, it's a nice place to spend time with the family.< /review>

Buy tickets from Groupon or other websites as they are cheap but be sure to check for blackout dates and restrictions. Park at Westlawn Garage. The slide did not felt worth the $8 price tag. The night view of downtown and LA city is good but might not be great for pictures unless you are good with your camera/settings.</Text>

<text>It was a beautiful experience. I didn't know what to expect. I bought my tickets through Airb&b so I didn't have to wait in line. Once you get to floor 70 you reach the jazz music. It's a small seating area and I was annoyed by people talking loudly. You can walk around the floor to go out on decks which is very pretty. My daughter and I had a good time.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9</GmapID></record>

<Text>For a "tourist attraction" it was alright.. The view from above is what makes it worth the money. You can see all of LA. If you want a little more adrenaline spend an extra $8 and go down the slide.< /Text>< username>

<review>Okay the view is nice, but the whole place reeks of tourist trap. The food, sold out of a refrigerator case, is expensive and not great, the slide a joke. Seriously, unless you have young children (they might like the slide), don’t waste your money. I rarely write negative reviews, but do consider whether you want to spend your money here. There are so many other places in LA worth the money. This was a huge disappointment.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I love this observation deck! I've been to plenty of large city observation decks and this is probably my favorite one. It is sort of designed as a hang out spot with plenty of comfortable seating. The glass slide was a bit short but definitely thrilling. I would highly recommend visiting the observation deck and trying out the slide as well< /Text>

A bit overpriced but the view is OK. Nothing special as you only can see the surrounding buildings and there are not many interesting sights. But it is worth to come up and have a look around.</Text>

The slide was fun but super quick.  Best views are on the platform or upstairs where the line is because the block the windows with tables and TVs on the main floor where the observation deck is located.  It was also loud when I went because they had a dj.</text>

Get the family deal. It's cheaper and you get free cocktails to enjoy on the 70th floor veranda.  Also unlimited rides for kids.< /Text>

Great 360 degree views, and the slide was so much fun! I actually recommend going first thing when it opens in the morning because there are no lines what-so-ever and you have the whole place to yourself.

Don't be nervous about the slide, it's over in a second. Just go slow and take in the view! Great place to go with friends and take photos together. Worth seeing at least once. If you buy tickets online, you also save a lot of money.<//text>

Nice view of the city, love the slide. Good experience. I would highly recommend it to view the city. BUT. Do not park on the city national plaza parking garage. They charge me $40 dls for an hour and half. I think that was a RIP OFF!</review>

Really great experience, very chilled and relaxing. There is a bar where you can get a pretty decent cocktail. We just loved spending time on the sofas on the viewing deck. And of course unsurpassed views of LA.< /text>

<review>It has some pretty incredible views, the service was good, but it's extremely expensive. Very knowledgeable about the area. Good place for a corporate event. In order to get up to the top you have to go through metal detector. The illusion of security was funny.</review></record></dataset><record>

Surprised my fiancé here with a proposal. Stephanie was involved so helpful in everything. Setting up this surprise was very stressful for me and I had to visit the site multiple times with photographers and videographers and Stephanie was beyond helpful. During the day of, the entire staff throughout OUE Skyspace knew who she was, who I was, and what was going on. They helped me sneak in the ring through the metal detector and everything. Once we got up there, the entire terrace was closed off for us, she provided space for our family to observe from above, and I had what I believe to be the most romantic proposal ever. This place was our first date too, so it was legit special.

The views from up there are amazing, you can see far out, it does get a little cold though so be sure to bring a jacket.

Great place for date night if you're not ready to propose!< /Text>

<Review>It is an absolutely amazing place to go! They have a slide at the top of the USBank building, that goes from the 70th floor to the 69th floor! The best part of it, is that it is fully made out of glass. It’s an amazing experience sliding down a tall building being able to look down while you do it! Definitely 5 star!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

If you're dying to see the city from a tall building, go for it. But I felt like I just threw away $34. Didn't see much appeal.</review>

Cons: $25 each just to go up for the views, exhibits are minimal, $8 extra  (each) to go down the transparent slide (of which only takes 1-2 seconds,  then its done), their employees take pics of you as you go down this slide; if you want 1-2 of the pictures then they charge you $30. The whole thing is just a money grab (not to mention parking). We were pretty much done within 30 minutes .< /text></record></dataset><record>

It was fun. One of the nicest thing to do in the centre of LA in fact! The sky slide, despite being really short, is really cool. Possibility of staying indoor or going outdoor  to take photos.< /review>

< review>
Was visiting LA and after seeing OUE Skyspace on a show that I watch, I had penciled it into my itinerary. Found myself with time to see this attraction on the first day and was super excited. When I arrived and went to purchase tickets, that is where the disappointment began. We had to pay to just get up to the slide, and extra to experience the slide itself. The "attractions" leading up to the slide were not even worth the money, and I wish there was an option to skip and just pay to experience the slide. Got to the slide itself and was told they were "temporarily closed" due to weather. Weather...that was miles out... "oh but we saw lightening..." again MILES out. Where we were, the sky was still blue and we only had about 5 people waiting in line. Mind you, the slide itself only goes down a floor and is less than a minute long. In the time it took them to utter the words "closed temporarily due to weather," they could have had all 5 of us down the slide and back inside. I understand safety concerns, however it feels like the staff were taking it very literally and were under trained. So we waited...and waited... finally another guest asked to speak to a manager and was told they were coming right up to assess the situation. Again...more waiting and waiting...(30 minutes in total) to the point that the guest had to leave because she was being charged over time for parking (because she had already waited close to 2 hours for a less than 5 minute ride). Finally after she left, the manager showed up (guess she chose to climb the 70 flights instead of taking the elevator), and was already in a mood. Let all of us know that the ride was closed, and they weren't sure for how long, that if we went downstairs we would be refunded. So that is what we all did, went downstairs and got refunded. (Later I looked at the back of the ticket and it says no refunds for any reason; so I am hoping to actually get refunded). They told us we could get a "rainy day discount," if we re-bought tickets to use at another time. We thought, sure why not, only to find out the "discount" was for that previous admittance to the building that I had mentioned earlier, not for the slide itself (what a joke). Then the icing on top of the cake was that we were charged $42 in parking, because we had parked in a garage close by (and didn't see the sign that said they charged $4/minute and had a max of $42...welcome to LA). Ended up riding the slide later on in the trip, and it was alright, definitely a unique thing to experience. But overall the customer service and the under trained staff were very UNDERWHELMING!< /review>

A must go, even if you're afraid of heights. The views are stunning and if you go when  they open a Sunday, it's not crowded whatsoever.  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  Of course the infamous slide which I'm too chicken to attempt.  And a refreshment station inside that serves beverages and ice creams. Parking is at the library for $8 (at least when we went). A great way to spend a few hours of your weekend.</Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Great views of Los Angeles and everything around it. See each far south as Long Beach, West as far as the ocean, east all the way into the valley, and north up to the Hollywood sign and Griffith observatory. It's a little pricey to get in but if you are a sight seer you will appreciate the experience. There's also a bar and cafe on the roof so you can plan around a meal or happy hour to make the visit an extended one. If you want to get really swank, rent the 70th floor and have your own private party. I came during the day so I can only imagine what the nighttime views are like! 😎<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Awesome is the main word. You can see the entire Los Angeles with an amazing panoramic view of the whole city! The staff is one of the best polite people. It's an amazing place to enjoy and have a great time with the family at a height of more than 1,000 feet!<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The glass slide did not meet the expectation at all! The view from top is great. We went for sunrise yoga, which included unlimited rides on slide.
Lot of scope for improvement!<//Review>

Fun, beautiful experience! Take your time taking in the views and going through the exhibit. You'll love this if you're a photofile.  The slide is exciting and most talked about, but in retrospect, the views topped off this visit. Pictures taken on the slide could definitely have a better resolution; hopefully they will upgrade in future. I would recommend having a member of the party who doesn't want their photo taken to go first and video /take photos from the slide exit of the others coming down the slide, or take turns for the best shots.< /text>

<user_name>Owen Jin< /user_name><review>This is better than the deck at Wilshire Grand (also far higher).  The view of Los Angeles is spectacular, and you really get a sense of urban sprawl.

First of all, I was pretty shocked at the $27 price tag to simply look at a view.The only reason I went to this establishment was to be able to take professional videos, however it wasn't until my card was out to pay that I was told that my tripod wouldn't be allowed (??). The woman taking my payment said she would check to see if my gimbal would be allowed, she didn't, and charged me anyway even though noticing my hesitation. The view is nice but gets pretty boring quick. For $27 you'd think a free drink would be thrown in but unfortunately not. Wouldn't go back.<//text>

It's a tourist trap. Incredible views of downtown LA, but it can be pricey and the slide is definitely not worth it. Don't be fooled by the pricey food up at the top; there are plenty of great places down below. Try to also go on a day that is clear and crisp, as a hot, sweltering day brings lots of smog and severely limits your view.</review>

<Text>We went to the top floor i guess from which you can probably see the entire of LA. Also i took the slide of the 70th floor to the 69th floor that is entirely on the exterior of the building literally. It's a short slide but it was fun spending some extra dollars for it. If you are on a vacation or touring LA then i suggest you to go up there, have a drink and enjoy the view. It's crazy< /Text>< gmapID>

Incredible view of the city. I'd love to see it at sunset and on a really clear winter day. I'm sure you can see both the mountains and the ocean in one view. They do try to rip off visitors with the photo prices but otherwise a nice way to see how awesome LA is.< /Review>

<Review>Great spot to chill out on the 71st floor with a (plastic)glass of wine. Overlooking Los Angeles. What gorgeous views. On the way up you get a quick history lesson of Los Angeles and the culture.<//Review>< pictures>

So much fun! It was weird to be enclosed but so open. Very short ride, however, would don't expect anything crazy. The views were incredible though.< /review>

< Review>
Travelled clear across the country. Paid over $200 for the LA go cart. Did not realize that we had to enter by 530. Arrived at 7 PM. And was denied entry. Worst experience ever. Staff was not willing to help! Do not go here. Do not waste your time go find something else to do<//Review>

<Text>The skyspace parking is confusing make sure you park in the appropriate lot and check before you leave the building or your parking will not get validated. The slide is okay and you don't really feel much I suggest if you don't want to spend extra money don't do it. The view is pretty good but it gets boring very quickly the only cool thing is the pair of things on the glass I would suggest only go here if you have time to kill.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNB33QBj3Z2TiXfd5w4POsh1KioRBxp4C3hcWP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

<Review>Went during the day, it would probably be best to go at night if you'd want to enjoy the lights. There's not much to it though, just basically the view. No real drink or food options or anything else to do. You'd think you'd get more for your money. Also, DON'T waste your money buying the slide picture, the quality is NOT worth the $30!! (the only reason why I did was because I went solo, and well, I wanted a picture)< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9</gmap_id></record>

Well it's all about the view which is unbeatable. The slide is short and not too exciting. Could have been way better. But fun times.< /text>

Amazing views especially with sunset.
Definitely worth a visit. Skyslide a bit short and finished before you started! Take some time to have a cocktail or beer 1000ft high with breathtaking views< /Review>

Oh my goodness!!!! What a beautiful place!!! The views are amazing! The slide is exciting! Over priced in my opinion, nearly $100 for 3 people but I'd totally go again. I'm just in love with the views. Lots of seating space, fresh air, fun photo activities. They also have a very small snack bar with nespresso coffee, excellent coffee, and chips....<//review>

My friend kept wanting to leave like a lame bcs he said he was scared. This place is amazing tho. I didnt do the slide bcs i rather do it during the day. Usbank tower views are unreal, you cant get anymore los angeles than that honestly. Its a recommendation to everyone to come here. Everything is stunning and well worth the $20.

$15 parking
$25 Admission
$5 brochure fee (I thought that was free but ends up paying for it)
The whole experience was not worth it. Once in a lifetime deal...
Recommendations: either lower the price or add more value to the package....< /Review>

Before this I never had seen LA like this before. There are 2 patios to give you more of a 360 degree view. Above one patio is where the slide comes down. There are 2 different ticket proces one for riding the slide and one for just going up. Inside is a food area and bar and a photobooth where you choose your background. The day i went one patio was closed early for a private event. Overall this was a great experience and i cannot wait to visit again.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

You can see so much, on a clear day. This is a great place to take out of town visitors to give them some perspective on the scope and sprawl of Los Angeles.

Take your visitors back in the evening to see the sunset and a experience Los Angeles at night.

There are a couple of outdoor terraces to get you closer to the view.

There is even a restaurant just below the observation level.

The only issue with this place are the number of private events that limit your access to various parts of the observation level. Being informed about these private events when you book online seems to be hit or miss. Don't be surprised if you start seeing sections of the observation level being roped off.</text>

Amazing place downtown LA that offers an incredible view from the 84th floor!
Moreover you can try a little glass slide that gives you the sensation to fly for few seconds!
Thanks to my great friend BBB that surprisingly took me there for first time in my life! 👌😘❤️🌹< /text>

Even though it was a cloudy morning I enjoyed the view of the city. Interesting displays and "tech toys" in the queue area. A snack bar up top with seating to relax and enjoy time at the top</Review>

<Review>This is the tallest building in Los Angeles. A very beautiful clean building. The cashier talked me into buying the map for 5 bucks but dont waste your money on that. When I was up there I did not even use that map. The view is awesome and I was videotaping and taking pictures when I was up there. That was the last thing I did before I left L.A. and I encourage all visitors to put this on your "to do list". Also for me the best time was the evening when you see the city lit all beautiful. They also have a bar up there if you want some drinks. But either way you will enjoy it up there. Cheers!!! 😉<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Definitely not what its hyped up to be, some of the exhibits were closed and $25 per person plus $8 for the slide (which should've been included in price) is just too steep of a price . I would definitely recommend Griffith observatory or other venues for an Amazing views of the city. Sn: Don't Waste your Money !!!!!</Text>< userid>

Me and my wife visit his location at night on Valentine's day. I'm extremely afraid of heights but enjoyed the slide down to the 69th floor. Very nice building however you're only accessible to a couple of floors before you get up to the 70th floor and prepare for the slide down. The slide is very quick, and it is see through, so you will see the bottom and how far you are down from the ground. There are some landing mats at the end of the slide and staff a pretty helpful. Nice but overpriced and overrated gift shop. A nice place to visit at least once.</Review>

Didn't ride the slide due to some anxiety issues ha ha ha! All in all, the staff was uber friendly and professional. The cheesecake, fruit pie, and beer was all on point. Will be one of my go-to spots for visiting family and friends from now on.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>If there is one thing about amazing views, it's getting to watch the sunset from the tallest building in the west! OUE Skyspace LA is truly a great venue, tourist attraction, and place for people to see most of Los Angeles. I would call it the most breath-taking roof-top in Los Angeles. When I'm looking down from OUE Skyspace, I'm thinking, "wow, I was just there like 2 days ago," or, "wow I didn't know there was a parking lot next to that place." Or, "wow that's a lot of traffic."< /Text></record>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>Sure, the views are great. But it’s very expensive and it’s a one & done kind of place - I don’t feel the need to ever go back. Very hard to get good landscape photos, the glass barrier and windows are coated with a material that distorts light through your camera lens. Good for a casual lounge place to watch sunset.< /Review>< Pictures>

Nice views during the day and at night. Not worth the price though. You could get a similar view at a nice restaurant in dtla or un Hollywood for free. I rode the slide in the evening. It was fun but the view is not great at night. Do it during the day. They have butterflies painted on the glass. Nice for a photo OP  however you'll probably have to stand in line to get a pic. The bar was cool. Good wine and there was a really sweet African American bartender that went above and beyond. I wish I could remember her name. Oh well.</Review>

<Review>This place is well facilitated to promote skyscraper experience for travelers and locals. It offers ticket for reasonable price, as you can get experience near the top of the building. The slide is somewhat short to pay additional 6dollars. The view of this tower and art work in the windows are valuable<//Review>< Pics>

They have a slide that hangs from the side of the building beware they do take a picture of you coming down the slide. Wasn't the prettiest picture of me but it captured the moment.

They don't let you take any pictures or videos on the glass slide. Then the picture they provide for purchase has horrible quality. The drinks are not good but the view is nice. Not worth the time or money to go.</Review>

Wasn't worth the hype. I paid $8 for my daughter to ride the short slide. I went here because of the LA Go card. We assumed the admission included the slide like universal Studios and knotts Berry Farm, but there was this extra charge. The facility was just alright but it did give me insight to the fashion district in LA and this is where we went afterwards!</review>

A very expensive way to get a view of the city part of Los Angeles.

However, this is pretty much a one-time only kind of attraction.  Once you live it, there really is not any reason to come back.  You saw everything there was to see, for a lot of money.

It was about $70 for my partner and I to essentially take an elevator up, see two little art displays (the elevator shaft one is very cool though), slide down a slide for three seconds, and then get a view.

Parking is horrible, and charges something like $4 every 15 minutes instead of an hour, so we parked a little down the road for $8 flat.

This attraction is done very quickly.  Don't expect to spend a lot of time here.   An hour at most if you're into the history of the building and the videos before you go up.

And if you're going to come, you might as well do the slide because if you decide you DO want to do it again in the future, you'll have to pay another $30 for that.

They have a few photo booths that are free, but they give you terrible pictures.  Theres a little giftshop on your way out as well, if you're into those tacky location specific souvenirs.

I can't say the place is terrible, but if you want visit just for the views, theres probably much cheaper ways to get it.  If you're looking for a good view of LA, visit Griffith Observatory.</text>

It's fine.  Yes the views are great, but other than that I cannot see spending $25 min ea to go up to the top just for the views.  I've done this once now and hope to never have to take any other visitors here again.  I mean $25 min to go here just to see views?  Common!!!< /Review>

The shortest slide ever and you can't even bring your phone to video/take pics. They take a professional pic for you and you have to pay about 15-25 to get a copy of it. Nonetheless, beautiful views of the city and obv plenty of potential for cool photos and that perfect IG pic.< /review>< Gmap_id>

It's good but not worth the money. I got a deal from rush49 and got the tickets $17 per person.
If you do the slide (for 5 seconds only) from top it will be few more bucks.
I've been to other towers like this in other cities. They are cheaper compared to this. Neverthless, something like this is in LA for the first time, so have to give it a credit.<//Text>

<Review>Listen, I am deathly afraid of heights and I came up here with my friend. I felt safe and sound. The view was amazing and the staff was super chill. The price to get into this place was 33 bucks, not bad for an experience for a date. They have a floor with digital screens of the Los Angeles view, some interactive art, and a photo op of course. You take another elevator up to get to the glass slide and a view that's above the city and the clouds.  The glass slide, freaked me out but it was so much fun even if it was short. Remember I have a fear of heights and I did it and enjoyed it. Highly recommend coming here</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>This was very fun! I feel like the price was a little high as the digital experiences inside were not all that riveting. But hey, it's LA! The slide was so fun though, I was so so nervous but it went by quickly that you almost forget as you're going down. The slide only goes down one floor and past a few windows to add length.< /Review>< Pics>

Beautiful view of the city and beyond. I recommend this if you are visiting or local and haven't been yet. There was a nice little tour prior to going up to the top that gave some fun facts about LA. The slide was the only disappointing part. Very small slide and too expensive for the experience. All the staff we encountered were very friendly.< /text>

<text>Brand new spot with the best views of Los Angeles with an adrenaline-stoking glass slide 1,000 feet in the air.  Highly recommend buying your tickets online and printing at home as the lines are long. Allow time for the Skyslide line during busy times.

The top floor of the observation lounge is enclosed with a 360 degree view of LA.  The lower floor has 2 open decks overlooking East and West of the building.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

This place is not that exciting, don't believe all the hype. I took my three-year-old, five year old and nine year old and they were not impressed whatsoever and the ride is very very very short. You are expected to pay $27 for a child and they only get to ride one time. My 2 older kids said the ride was pretty late. don't waste your money.</Review>

Great city views!!! But the sky slide is too slow and really only last for 3-4 seconds. It's be great if they had a restaurant and bar up there! But without the restaurant or bar you'll get bored pretty quickly.<//Review>

The main reason to go up is definitely the views from either side of the building. The other attractions besides the observation deck are pretty thin and "instagramy." But overall, I had a great time with my whole family.</Text><resp>None< /resp><Name>Jordon von Helf<//Name><GmapID>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9</GmapID><Rate>4</Rate></record>

Must visit place in LA.
Awesome views of the whole city especially during sunset and late evening.
The transparent slide is fun as well.
Two lookout terraces provide good views of both side if the city.
Ample photo opportunities for family.< /Review>

<review>For the price of admission I'm not sure it's worth it.  They did a good job of making the experience of going up an elevator and walking through the floors a cool experience with some cool, interactive things to do.
The view is amazing and the slide isn't.
It's worth going but only once,  maybe grab some food.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Kids loved this place. It's like having a Taipei 101 in LA.  Of course not as high but good to have one locally.  Jennifer the docent was very helpful and informative.  We had fun at the selfie station.</Review>

Went in the later morning and despite smog still being present, had a really fun time.  It wasn't crowded at all.  Very clean area with lots of open seating that you can enjoy a drink and look out at the city below.  Then, we went outside on the deck and that was fun too.  Didn't do the slide since it didn't seem worth it for the $$, but access to the place was definitely worth it.  Your pass also goes to a small museum inside before walking out to the view area too, which was pretty cool.  Staff was very friendly.. would definitely do again.<//review>

Incredible view of the city. I'd love to see it at sunset and on a really clear winter day. I'm sure you can see both the mountains and the ocean in one view. They do try to rip off visitors with the photo prices but otherwise a nice way to see how awesome LA is.< /Text>

Nice observation deck, with accommodations for photographers like slots in between the glass so that pictures don’t turn out blurry or anything like that. I would say it’s a little overpriced and the smog usually keeps you from seeing the ocean from the deck, but if you’re lucky you will see it. Great thing about this deck is you can get a real sense of scale for the immense size of the city.</review>

It was a great place to go to. We stayed until sunset and it was worth the 4hr wait. Magnificent view, got cold though so make sure to bring a jacket this time of the year.</Text>

<time>1535396219826< /time><Pics>None< /Pics><Text>We  went to Skyspace LA on a hot and smoggy day, so the views were  limited, we could not see out to Palos Verdes or the ocean. However the views of downtown were great. Our admission price for three people plus
1 slide ticket came to 86.00 plus 15.00 for garage parking plus 3 sandwiches with a little fruit on the side and 3 sodas came to 44.64.
They take pictures of you when you arrive and if you ride the slide.
The cost is 25.00 for one and 30.00 if you buy two. They search you before entering sort of like the airport. The workers are some what
friendly but not totally.I found the vibe at the observation deck to be very
good, a lot of tourist and locals just chilling and enjoying the views. Overall my experience at Skyspace LA was good, but not worth going back. Its just too pricey for what they have to offer.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Went for Christmas Day as it was one of the few places open in LA that wasnt ice skating or a theme park. Amazing views. Went to catch the sunset before going on the slide. Be prepared for 10001 consecutive photo shoots if you are trying to take a single picture for your new facebook profile pic. We paid for the slide, but system went down so everyone could slide for free which wasn't fair for those who had paid extra for it. Overall a great experience.</Text>

<Text>We really enjoyed this.  They've put a lot of work into making this a world class observation deck, and it shows.  You can save a few bucks by booking through Starline along with their tours, but the hassle to get those tickets redeemed is not worth the 2 bucks a ticket savings.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

A must-do for your tourist friends, or to get a new perspective of your (huge) city. Expect tickets to be a bit pricey - high $20s - but you can get great drinks upstairs and see a 360° view. Obvious must for the IG, plenty of photo ops!<//Review>

It was such an amazing experience! The staff are wonderful, polite, welcoming, and make the experience even better. The slide is definitely worth it! It's made my trip to LA one to remember.< /Review>

Great views and cool place to just relax and take the view in on a date. The slide is way to short and they don't have a bar YET. Once the bar is finalized I will definitely go back and chill with friends. I would say this is closer to a first date place rather than a chill with friends place.<//text>

<Text>The view is so nice! They told us it's the highest building in the USA west of Chicago. We reserved a ticket in advance on a weekday at 9pm. For some reason we were already there around 6pm and asked if we could go up earlier. The friendly staff said this was not a problem and rebooked our tickets.< /Text>< Pics>

I am glad to have this in LA. A lot of other major cities have a city overlook so I am glad LA now offers the same thing. I went up just for the view, I did not purchase the slide. The view is very nice, I went up at 4pm to be able to get a glimpse of LA during sunset. The lounge area is also nice, they have a lot of chairs and sofas. They also have screen that give visitors a brief history lesson. We stayed there for a while waiting on the sun to go down. Once it started getting a tad bit darker the buildings started lighting up so that was also a nice view. If you live in LA county or SoCal you get a discount by entering your zip code on the website when purchasing your tickets.<//review>

Had much higher hopes for the Sky Slide. It's over too quick, it's not a fast slide and you have to ride an opaque carpet down the glass tunnel... very nice views from around the slide though, and the novelty is cool.< /review>

Amazing views of Los Angeles. The slide is really fast and costs extra 8$. You can pay after reaching top if u want to for the slide.

You go to 54th floor first before they take u to 70th floor. Check out red carpet set up in 54th floor. It's funny.</review>

Not a bad place but not spectacular either. the price I thought was a little high and I didn't purchase the slide option, though if you do try it out I would recommend opting for it. a few interactive displays which were cool. Stationary binoculars were free and not coin operated which is a plus. It is an attraction, if in downtown LA check it out, if not I wouldn't say you're missing much.< /Review>

<Review>This place is well facilitated to promote skyscraper experience for travelers and locals. It offers ticket for reasonable price, as you can get experience near the top of the building. The slide is somewhat short to pay additional 6dollars. The view of this tower and art work in the windows are valuable<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9< /gmap_id></record>

Sure, the views are great. But it’s very expensive and it’s a one & done kind of place - I don’t feel the need to ever go back. Very hard to get good landscape photos, the glass barrier and windows are coated with a material that distorts light through your camera lens. Good for a casual lounge place to watch sunset.</Review>

Great city views!!! But the sky slide is too slow and really only last for 3-4 seconds. It's be great if they had a restaurant and bar up there! But without the restaurant or bar you'll get bored pretty quickly.<//review>

They don't let you take any pictures or videos on the glass slide. Then the picture they provide for purchase has horrible quality. The drinks are not good but the view is nice. Not worth the time or money to go.< /Text>

First that place is amazing, hmm this is my first time, I went with my friend, we went up without paying the ticket and it wasn't our fault, when we realized it at the top I told that to the employee that we got up without paying the ticket, simply we were kicked out!!! Thank you for respect!</Text>

Love the building,  my bank is in there! Security 24/7 then there is restaurants and a,theatre upstairs this is a gorgeous building!  You also get entertained by different show screening done by "OUE Skyspace",  which are fun to look at and very whimsical!  All this is very well done!!<//review>

<Text>The views of the city are 👍! I am definitely going back again. But sorry I can't say the same thing about the glass slide  👎! It's too short. It doesn't even give you time to feel the adrenaline. Paying $8 for two seconds on the slide... Not worthy!!!  I really don't recommend the slide to anyone.  Save your money please!!!< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9</gmapID>< rating>

<text>This place is well facilitated to promote skyscraper experience for travelers and locals. It offers ticket for reasonable price, as you can get experience near the top of the building. The slide is somewhat short to pay additional 6dollars. The view of this tower and art work in the windows are valuable<//text></record></dataset><record>

Very hard to get good landscape photos, the glass barrier and windows are coated with a material that distorts light through your camera lens. Good for a casual lounge place to watch sunset.<//review></record>

Brand new spot with the best views of Los Angeles with an adrenaline-stoking glass slide 1,000 feet in the air.  Highly recommend buying your tickets online and printing at home as the lines are long. Allow time for the Skyslide line during busy times.

The top floor of the observation lounge is enclosed with a 360 degree view of LA.  The lower floor has 2 open decks overlooking East and West of the building.<//review>

Priced like it is the bees knees, not sure it is truly worth it however ($35). I enjoyed the 8 second slide and views of the region but the price leaves a little to be desired. Glad it is here though.</text>< rating>

I had fun. I know it doesn't have a lot to offer other than the view and the slide (which is only one floor and 3 seconds long), but it was something new. I've never been that high before. I can say I did it. I look forward to see what else they do with it in the future. I hope they can expand the exhibit on the 54th floor to include more stuff. The view is amazing, and the slide was still cool even if it was short. I'd go again. Not too crowded when I went. I did go several weeks after it opened.< /text>

It's good but not worth the money. I got a deal from rush49 and got the tickets $17 per person.
If you do the slide (for 5 seconds only) from top it will be few more bucks.
I've been to other towers like this in other cities. They are cheaper compared to this. Neverthless, something like this is in LA for the first time, so have to give it a credit.<//Text>

The view is so nice! They told us it's the highest building in the USA west of Chicago. We reserved a ticket in advance on a weekday at 9pm. For some reason we were already there around 6pm and asked if we could go up earlier. The friendly staff said this was not a problem and rebooked our tickets.</Text>

<text>Went for Christmas Day as it was one of the few places open in LA that wasnt ice skating or a theme park. Amazing views. Went to catch the sunset before going on the slide. Be prepared for 10001 consecutive photo shoots if you are trying to take a single picture for your new facebook profile pic. We paid for the slide, but system went down so everyone could slide for free which wasn't fair for those who had paid extra for it. Overall a great experience.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Nice observation deck, with accommodations for photographers like slots in between the glass so that pictures don’t turn out blurry or anything like that. I would say it’s a little overpriced and the smog usually keeps you from seeing the ocean from the deck, but if you’re lucky you will see it. Great thing about this deck is you can get a real sense of scale for the immense size of the city.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9< /gmap_id></record>

<text>Skyspace is the attraction and venue that LA has been expecting forever, but never truly realized till now. I had the great privilege of previewing Skyspace. It is - all at once - modern, historic, unique and obvious. It is technologically the most progressive; historically connected by space, vision and location. It is the only place with the purest perspective of LA county and beyond; and it is the day trip you didn't realize you missed.
But it's more than an attraction. It is a premiere venue unlike any other; access to it - at a wedding or corporate event or either as a host or as a guest - left me feeling not only elegant, but gave a certain social effervescence like I had achieved a certain personal and social status as an LA resident. While it remains to be seen how time treats Skyspace, it is the attraction you wish you had visited the first time you ever moved to LA.< /text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Resp>

Ummm I paid to go up to the 70th floor and that's basically it Haha but I loved the view so 3 stars!! Slide is too short but so inventive  :) dranks are pricey as per usual in downtown. I loved touching Kopitar's Jersey though 😍 maybe bump up a star 3.5 parking is validated and 8 bucks until 12am.<//Review>

<text>Way to expensive for what you get. Drinks and food isn't free either. Should be complimentary for the price you pay to go up there. The slide was disappointing, super small and boring. But, a very nice view, perfect to watch sunsets. Worth a try, but won't come back for that price.</text></record>

Visit 1 hour before sunset to capture the best pictures. You will also find interactive displays and historical videos about Los Angeles. A cafe is available for sitdown coffee or drinks. Skyspace LA alos has 2 observation decks with totally different views of the Los Angeles skyline. Plenty of parking but plan to arrive early as it's a bit confusing to find parking if you are not familiar with the one way streets.

Weak and way too overpriced. Paid $68 for two people. The view is okay but nothing spectacular. There isn’t much to see. Downtown LA is bland and too smoggy/hazy to see anything far away. The slide was a joke. It’s 2 seconds long so you don’t get to see anything while sliding. My gf scraped her elbow on the side wall. You’re much better off taking a hike at Griffith Park. The views from there are spectacular.</Review>

The views from the 69th floor observation decks are the best in Los Angeles. The slide is fun, although a short ride, and I found it worth the price and wait in line. It's a great place for both locals and tourists.<//Text>

Amazing view of downtown!! Best time to go there is sunset. A little too expensive the price for the entrance and you also need to pay valet to park but still really nice place to visit.< /Review>

Parked nearby at a lot. Walked towards the building and you see the oue sign in front. So go up stairs and there is the entrance. I bought my ticket online so went straight in and they took me up. The view at night was super clear, the slide took 2 seconds and is not scary, and there were some interactive displays of local landmarks that you could possibly see.  I did not eat at the cafe, but they served food and drinks. Spent about 30-45 minutes up there and saw everything.</review>

The interactive floor is actually just a room that has the optic mind game you usually see on pics, and videos that play over and over mentioning data about LA, there's nothing interactive about it. The slide is super short, takes like 6 seconds, and the good part is the terrace and that floor in which you actually have interactive screens that allow you to learn a few things about the city, the industry, places to visit, etc.

We went at night and all the people that were working on that shift looked like they would rather be sleeping than working. And when they were closing, they rushed us so they could finish. I don't get why they sold the last ticket at 9pm if they're not going to have a good service. Store was closed, and restaurant as well.

Super disappointed with the pack I purchased and my expectations. I recommend you stick to just going to thw terrace.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I think is a little bit to pricey $25.00 per person and $8.00 for the slide ,it was so crowded and there's not to much to do up there once your done with the sliding .< /Review>

This place is outstanding and you ride on a slide outside the 70 floor of one of the tallest buildings in LA. And the walk around was phenomenal they serve drinks and food it was an enjoyable visit<//Text>

Not really worth the 25 dollar fee (33 if you do the sky slide). Views of downtown are cool but other places will give you the same or better for free. Sky slide is way too short (only one floor and over in like 2 seconds).</text>

In fact, because there is far less people jostling for a spot it is far more pleasant. Because the skyscraper is located in DTLA, it is fairly accessible by metro.

There are a few videos and interactive things to do prior to the skyspace viewing deck. I am pleasantly surprised by the cool facts about LA overall.

We also did the sky slide which although short was fairly exciting.

The rounabout views were excellent and photography opportunities ample.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

But paying $8 for Skyslide? It's totally up to you.

Even I like this place, still my favorite place for the best night city view is in Signal Hill!!!!!!!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

A must see for a first timer in the city.  Centrally located, on a clear day the Skyspace LA offers views of all of LA, including the Hollywood sign.  Helicopters fly around and land on nearby buildings and you can watch the hustle and bustle from 70-floors up.  Lots of photo ops and interactive experiences including the glass slide.  It's cool but would be cooler if you could film it yourself with your phone.  Take a gopro to capture the experience.  Just a block away is Grand Central Market, another must adventure.  I highly reccommend experiencing Skyspace!<//Review>

Good place if you are first time goin to sky rapper..I will not suggest going for slide, which is really water of time and money with no much fine. By the time you are about to feel you are sliding, it is over!< /text>

Great lookout balconies around the entire 69th floor. The slide is only 1 floor high. Not a long wait. Staff is friendly and not pushy, giving you time to come to grips with hurling yourself out of the 70th floor. 4 stars for the fun factor. Would be 5 if the slide was a bit longer.<//text>

(Don't expect good gramar out of me I went to a LAUSD school) This place was great the slide wasn't scary make sure you got your ready face because they take a pic of you going down the slide. Nobody told me so I came out looking like The Incredibles. For 2 people its like $68 so be ready to spend some money. The bar on top is alright don't expect anything Fancy. The View is nice.<//text>

<user>111151566101526755124<//user><Text>this was genuinely a great experience. I lived in LA my whole life and seeing the whole city from  above was amazing and made me appreciate its beauty in a way I nvr thought. I didn't see the sketchy streets/people, the dirty side walks, the trash, or pollution. I got to see it's architecture, the cities  activity, and the sun rise from a different view. And the slide was bad ass but rEally short like 4 sec but worth it.<//Text>< Date>

I was really excited to go to the tower that I purchased a pack entrance, that included the interactive floor, the slide and the terraces. The interactive floor is actually just a room that has the optic mind game you usually see on pics, and videos that play over and over mentioning data about LA, there's nothing interactive about it. The slide is super short, takes like 6 seconds, and the good part is the terrace and that floor in which you actually have interactive screens that allow you to learn a few things about the city, the industry, places to visit, etc.

We went at night and all the people that were working on that shift looked like they would rather be sleeping than working. And when they were closing, they rushed us so they could finish. I don't get why they sold the last ticket at 9pm if they're not going to have a good service. Store was closed, and restaurant as well.

Super disappointed with the pack I purchased and my expectations. I recommend you stick to just going to thw terrace.< /review>

Who doesn't want to look at the city from the 70th floor of a building? Excellent views on all sides. Didn't try the slide as it seemed very short and too expensive. The area was very clean and they have drinks and snacks available for sale. Also liked the entrance on the 54th floor where they have a glass floor section that looks down to the bottom of the building.<//review>

Centrally located, on a clear day the Skyspace LA offers views of all of LA, including the Hollywood sign.  Helicopters fly around and land on nearby buildings and you can watch the hustle and bustle from 70-floors up.  Lots of photo ops and interactive experiences including the glass slide.  It's cool but would be cooler if you could film it yourself with your phone.  Take a gopro to capture the experience.  Just a block away is Grand Central Market, another must adventure.  I highly reccommend experiencing Skyspace!<//Review>< Response>

Best views in all of LA - next time we get any rain, take the day off the first day the sunshine returns and prepare to swoon over the indescribable, truly magnificent 360 view of LA County from the ocean to the foothills.  Long overdue,  if a bit pricey.< /Review>

Skyspace is a good place for night city view!! $25 for entering fee is not that bad, you know this is LA. :(

But paying $8 for Skyslide? It's totally up to you.

Even I like this place, still my favorite place for the best night city view is in Signal Hill!!!!!!!</Review>

Go for the view. There are some cool sciency exhibits and a scary-looking but actually kind of tame outdoor slide (at least that's what I hear, I was too wimpy to try it). But the view of LA at night was the part I won't forget.</Review>

View is fantastic. Overpriced for just going down once. Café has good foof but is also expensive. Personnel is very friendly and helpful. Tickets can be easily purchased in their webpage. Just be sure what you want before buying. Look at reviews and understand the inclusions. Just go with the cheapest one I recomend. It is an ok place to visit.</Review>

Very cool spot, the glass slide really isn't worth it though. You slide one floor,  not thrilling whatsoever nor is the view all that. But the view when at the top is great.<//text>

Beautiful views from the top of the US Bank building. The glass slide leaves something to be desired. The ride is legitimately a half-second long. Too short to even get scared. By the time you want to yell, it's over.<//review>

< Review>
Whilst many flock to Griffith’s for the view of LA, much fewer come to this place which is just as incredible if not more. In fact, because there is far less people jostling for a spot it is far more pleasant. Because the skyscraper is located in DTLA, it is fairly accessible by metro.

There are a few videos and interactive things to do prior to the skyspace viewing deck. I am pleasantly surprised by the cool facts about LA overall.

We also did the sky slide which although short was fairly exciting.

The rounabout views were excellent and photography opportunities ample.</Review>

The entire experience is simple but well done. The stop before going to the top of the building features local art and some interactive exhibits. The top includes the slide and lots of views.  They definitely missed opportunities to have maps to point out landmarks and cities. The slide itself is short and not too thrilling. Since the slide isn't banked, you hit the slide of the slide right at the beginning. Overpriced, yes but still a good time.</text>

<Review>This place was so exciting, thrilling and fun. It was a new experience like no other. Sliding out of a window on a clear slide towering over the whole entire los angeles made my heart race with adrenaline amd excitement all at once. The employees are very friendly amd pleasant . the scenery is dope. There was no boring waiting time. Not too pleased with the choices in the cafe but overall great adventure for families, cpuples, friends or solo. I would suggest anyone visiting Los Angeles to make this excursion part of yoyr plans. Its an experience of a lifetimes. Even my 70 year old aunt had a blast slidong down, although she ended up coming out sideways and out of the sack..she was laughing amd smiling the whole time.  Best idea ever  to place a slide.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Honestly I had excellent customer service who were quite bored and uninterested with everybody. Went on weeknight in November so the slide was free but like everyone the cost of admission is high and it's not worth it, the views are amazing and so is the setup. With out drinks or food there's isn't much to do but just hang out.< /text>

Good if you're a tourist ,but is way overpriced just to be taken on a an elevator to the top floor. Also the slide is only one floor it may be more suited for children then adults.< /Review>

One of the best places to see LA from the top.
Do not get the slide because its useless and waste of money (maybe get it for your child.) The staff are friendly<//review>

Nice view. The slide was 5 seconds and a bit boring. Not much food to chose from.< /text>

<Text>I visited Oue Skyspace as result of a Raise The Roof fundraiser for Miry's List sponsored by Yelp.

Hands down an AMAZING view of downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Santa Monica, Brentwood and beach areas. My suggestion is that if you can, the best time to visit this attraction is at night - there is something magical about the view and the city lights. I have photographed the skyline in daytime settings a number of times over the years, but the view at night provides a different perspective.

As you are entering the attraction, you are taken to time lapse photography of many landmarks of Los Angeles - Griffith Observatory, Hollywood, downtown Los Angeles. There is a walk of fame before you enter the attraction, that provides trivia about Los Angeles, including movie trivia. Additionally, there are a number of interactive displays, including a selfie station near the exhibit. Take the time to do them all!

Before you take the plunge to do the slide, take the time to look at the different views of the city. There is a bar, and prepared food with snacks and beverages. The slide itself is very quick - REMEMBER to look to your left as you slide down! You are transported to a patio, which has couches and heat lamps.

There is a gift shop on second floor that sells everything from poster art to t-shirts, books and keychains. This is also where you purchase your souvenir photo coming down the slide!

Please be advised that there is a security check before you enter. You may not take cigarette lighters up to the top; you can check them at the reception desk and retrieve upon exit. Also there is no locker to place your belongings, but you may place your backpack or handbag between your legs as you slide down. Heels are not recommended, but if you love your heels, you may also place them in-between your legs and put them back on when you get to the bottom.

My only thought about the attraction is that it is too short. Otherwise it was a great event, and a wonderful way to do good and have fun in a great space!</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The price for this is outrageous. If you don't mind paying a lot of money for essentially just a great view, go ahead. I also had a bad experience with the bartender but that did not even influence my rating.</Review>

I guess would be cool if u have never, ever been on a top of a building..

Lame if you have been to New York and Paris... Or even Houston.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c7b31522c94b:0x320383c89fde4dd9< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great panoramic views of the city, good views even when cloudy. They had some cool attractions such as a tunnel that looks down 50 stories and some art, however, the glass slide was kind of underwhelming.</review>

Great addition to downtown L.A. The 360 degree views from the top are breathtaking and the lobby has a very futuristic appeal. A must visit for tourists and locals!</Text>

<review>You must do the slide it was fuuunnnn.  The view was great but overcast for the day so hard to see far.  The slide is short but worth it as you slide on the outside of the building looking 70 floors down.</review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

It offers beautiful view of LA but prepaid parking is confusing. You need to get it stamped before returning to parking. And there wasn't stroller accessible elevator to go to 2nd floor.</review>

<review>Waited 2 1/2 hours, then they shut the slide down for an hour for the fireworks show. There were still 30 people I front of us. It was hot and crowded. We finally gave up and went home. It took us 30 minutes to get the elevator to the ground floor.
Worst managed attraction I've ever been to!</review>< userid>

Nice place to end a date at sunset
Nice 360 view of DTLA

1. The bottom floor where you enter and exit looks like it was setup by a three year old. They have an unnecessary 2nd security line for people with "Skypass", which is fine, but they don't have any signs informing you on which line you're supposed to go in. (I got yelled at by security for going in the wrong line.)

2. The two observations decks have amazing views of course, but on both sides the view is distorted by the safety glass, I couldn't get any good pictures which is really disappointing.

And finally 3, the slide. I personally didn't try the slide, but I can assure you it's noting that amazing. You want real high-rise thrills? Try the attractions on top of the Stratosphere in Las Vegas.

In conclusion, it was a cool experience. But I don't see myself doing it again. If you plan on visiting, I would recommend not spending anymore money than you have to.</text>

A bit overpriced but definitely one of the easier ways to get a great view of L.A... Get great photos at night time!</review>

Great view of Los Angeles from here. Recommend going down the slide. Get a companion to make a video as you go down the slide, or you can buy the over priced official picture.</Review>

We went here on a limb to go and try the skyslide, I am petrified of heights, I went down the slide and was amazed with the view and terrified. While I am afraid of heights it was fun, if you are afraid of heights I say go for it and face your fear.<//Text>

To expensive to take a ride on the slide, one floor down for 21 dollars plus the people are not to friendly,  my ticket didn't scan, the black lady told me to comeback kind of rude, she scanned again and didn't say sorry or nothing.<//Text>

Total rip. Slide was about 12 ft. long and pictures taken had lines through them and attendants didn't even care, they still wanted $35 for like 2 pics.

<Time>1470240605186< /Time><Text>$35 to go up to the 2nd tallest building in DTLA (11th tallest in the US) and ride down ONE full story of slide…..
Really for $35 you couldn’t add in 4 more stories, a souvenir photo and some water.
Going up the elevators was exciting, and on a random Tuesday evening the wait was nonexistent and the view was spectacular. But really $35……
BEST part of this whole experience was Bernadette the line attendant. Her sass was life and she totally made it worth it to wait 15 mins while the manager raced down 70 stories to get more copies of a waiver. Oh yea if you wanna snap or video record yourself going down one whole story of slide (for 15 seconds) then you need to sign a waiver saying they are not liable for damaged phones.  The slide isn’t fast or windy or winding so holding on to the magic carpet they provide and your camera isn’t that risky.

They do have this cool little interactive museum before you ascend to the final level of the building but it’s not worth no $35.

Bar is not open to the public yet and they do have that new swank restaurant on the 71st floor where everything is $71 but I mean if they charging $35 for one for story imagine what they giving you for 71 dollars.</Text></record>

For the price it was okay... FYI... Online you could get tbt tickets for 19 a person for anytime entrance... While at the gate we're 25........it was decent but overpriced for the offering....< /review>

<rating>2< /rating><Time>1466993008412< /Time><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Juvi Guevara</Name><text>So, not the best place to come when looking for a few thrills in LA. For what you get, it's a bit overpriced, and the hassle of getting there & getting in certainly isn't worth it.

I went for the grand opening, (to the public), and after waiting half an hour to get in, we were ushered through security, up to the 54th floor, (where there is almost nothing to see except an impressive 360-degree display of the LA skyline & a few mediocre attractions), and then up to the 70th floor, where you can see out over every part of LA.

In the daytime, it leaves much to be desired, as all you can see is an almost colorless landscape & your quintessential LA smog. Though I can imagine that at night, it must be rather gorgeous, & I wish I could have had an eyeful of that glittering landscape. The only other attraction to be had at this level is the Skyscape Slide... Which, after an hour of waiting in an enormous line, turned into one of the most disappointing 4 seconds of my life. You blink, & it's over.

Soon there will be a restaurant at the top, (which I guarantee will also be overpriced, though might be worth the view), and a few cafes & bars at the bottom. Even for a tourist, this may not be the best that LA has to offer, but at least there are plenty of good restaurants nearby to wash the bad taste out of your mouth after this experience, if need be.< /text>< user_id>

What a horrible visit. Parking is unclear. I parked in the back entrance. This being the grand opening and such a big deal, you'd think they'd have signs telling people where to go. We eventually made our way to the entrance of the skyspace, which is half way up the stairs on the side of the building. I waited 20 minutes to get in. The entrance is not identified well and there was nobody ushering people where to go. Just as I almost got in, a group of 20 was ushered past me. I was like, "wait I didn't pay $92 for 2 VIP passes to be passed over like that."  That was only the beginning. Then we waited to get past security. They took my wife's water bottle, this will become an issue later.

We then waited for the elevator to the 54th floor. Saw some "attractions" that were basically glorified posters. And waited to take a photo. I even asked someone, if I don't want the photo, can I just move on, and they said no I have to wait. Just then, another group of 20 was ushered past me. Oh heck no!!!

Next we waited in line for another elevator to the 70th floor. And another group of 20 walks past, as well as a kid and his punk friends escorted through who probably had more money and clout than me, so there.

Then we get to the 70th floor and nobody is telling anyone where to go or what to do. We figured out the line that wrapped around the building is the line for the slide. Got in line and waited 1 hour. At this point, it's been 2 hours since I parked my car. We waited and waited. And guess what, more rich kids got escorted to the front of the line by staff. Eventually I got frustrated and found Blair, director of operations. Hoping he would right some wrongs, he basically told me they realized they messed up and gave me a pass to come back another day (not a VIP pass mind you). I went back to my wife and we figured we'd wait some more. We came for a slide and wanted to stay for the slide. Well, 30 minutes later, they're stopping the slide for fireworks and so we gave up. I found Blair again, but on my way to him notice the line is tripled in length and people are still coming up is masses. I said to him, from a operations point of view, you need to stop letting people in. You gotta shut it down. Fire hazard, crowd control, etc... You gotta do something. He blew me off.

So we head for the elevators to leave, and there's a 1 hour wait for that. At this point, I'm getting claustrophobic. I asked the bartender for a water and he says he's not allowed to sell them anymore (past 8pm). I found a water fountain. 1 isn't working and the other one - you guessed it - a long line.

I had to make a scene and threaten either a medical emergency or a incident involving handcuffs. But I got on that elevator!!!! When we got downstairs, turns out fights broke out, people were panicking and they WERE STILL LETTING PEOPLE IN. THE BOX OFFICE WAS STILL CHARGING PEOPLE!!!!

A disaster on all levels. City of LA should never had allowed this event nor this attraction. A copy of this review is going to my councilman's office and someone will be held responsible for the danger they put all those people in.   It's not even about money or convenience, this whole OUE thing stinks of back door deals that put money before people. And as for the passes you gave me worth $8, thanks but no thanks.< /Text>

Fantastic views, good staff, and although you book a 30 min slot, time it right and they'll let you stay for more than an hour. Speaking from experience.< /Review>

The view was nice but it was a waste of money. The slide was so short I couldn't even focus on anything outside. There is nothing really to do inside, even though they claim they have interactive activities.< /text>

<Text>What a horrible visit. Parking is unclear. I parked in the back entrance. This being the grand opening and such a big deal, you'd think they'd have signs telling people where to go. We eventually made our way to the entrance of the skyspace, which is half way up the stairs on the side of the building. I waited 20 minutes to get in. The entrance is not identified well and there was nobody ushering people where to go. Just as I almost got in, a group of 20 was ushered past me. I was like, "wait I didn't pay $92 for 2 VIP passes to be passed over like that."  That was only the beginning. Then we waited to get past security. They took my wife's water bottle, this will become an issue later.

We then waited for the elevator to the 54th floor. Saw some "attractions" that were basically glorified posters. And waited to take a photo. I even asked someone, if I don't want the photo, can I just move on, and they said no I have to wait. Just then, another group of 20 was ushered past me. Oh heck no!!!

Next we waited in line for another elevator to the 70th floor. And another group of 20 walks past, as well as a kid and his punk friends escorted through who probably had more money and clout than me, so there.

Then we get to the 70th floor and nobody is telling anyone where to go or what to do. We figured out the line that wrapped around the building is the line for the slide. Got in line and waited 1 hour. At this point, it's been 2 hours since I parked my car. We waited and waited. And guess what, more rich kids got escorted to the front of the line by staff. Eventually I got frustrated and found Blair, director of operations. Hoping he would right some wrongs, he basically told me they realized they messed up and gave me a pass to come back another day (not a VIP pass mind you). I went back to my wife and we figured we'd wait some more. We came for a slide and wanted to stay for the slide. Well, 30 minutes later, they're stopping the slide for fireworks and so we gave up. I found Blair again, but on my way to him notice the line is tripled in length and people are still coming up is masses. I said to him, from a operations point of view, you need to stop letting people in. You gotta shut it down. Fire hazard, crowd control, etc... You gotta do something. He blew me off.

So we head for the elevators to leave, and there's a 1 hour wait for that. At this point, I'm getting claustrophobic. I asked the bartender for a water and he says he's not allowed to sell them anymore (past 8pm). I found a water fountain. 1 isn't working and the other one - you guessed it - a long line.

I had to make a scene and threaten either a medical emergency or a incident involving handcuffs. But I got on that elevator!!!! When we got downstairs, turns out fights broke out, people were panicking and they WERE STILL LETTING PEOPLE IN. THE BOX OFFICE WAS STILL CHARGING PEOPLE!!!!

A disaster on all levels. City of LA should never had allowed this event nor this attraction. A copy of this review is going to my councilman's office and someone will be held responsible for the danger they put all those people in.   It's not even about money or convenience, this whole OUE thing stinks of back door deals that put money before people. And as for the passes you gave me worth $8, thanks but no thanks.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>It's a nice place to go once, the slide is over hyped and over priced,  my son wanted to try it so we did,  but not worth the price, also they tell you they validate parking,  they don't and the security that's suppose to validate is RUDE as can be.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I was really disappointed. I expected the slide to be bigger and it’s actually a tiny one. Also, they don’t even let you take pictures or videos inside the slide and make a huge deal if you do. Not worth the money or the time.</review>

Wonderful venue if you go at the right time (clear day, not too crowded, and right before sunset so you get both day view and night view). Quite pricey, but worth checking out. And yes, the slide is shorter than a 2 year old's patience.</text>

(Translated by Google) Beautiful views of LA. I definitely recommend trying the glass slide, which is built outside the skyscraper - quite an adrenaline experience.

Krásný výhled na LA. Určitě doporučuji vyzkoušet skleněnou skluzavku, která je postavena mimo mrakodrap - docela adrenalinový zážitek.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Spectacular views of LA, depending on the day and time of day the fog can get in the way a little.
Price in the range of $ 25 for entry per person, which I think is worth it. It has several galleries and activities of technological interactions during the ascent to the top.
The slide, although the idea is cool, I believe it is not worth the $ 10 that are charged.
We stopped at a nearby parking lot, paid $ 10 for 4 hours, which is reasonable considering the Downtown LA area and took the opportunity to visit other places.
Be sure to visit when passing through the region.

Vista espetacular de LA, dependendo do dia e horário a névoa pode atrapalhar um pouco.
Preço na faixa de $25 para entrada por pessoa, o que acho que vale a pena. Tem várias galerias e atividades de interações tecnológicas durante a subida ao topo.
O escorregador, apesar da ideia ser legal, acredito que não vale os cerca de $10 que são cobrados.
Paramos em um estacionamento nas proximidades, pagamos $10 por 4 horas, o que é razoável considerando a região de Downtown LA e aproveitamos para conhecer outras lugares.
Não deixe de visitar ao passar pela região.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Great place. On the 70th floor of the tower terraces with panoramic views. The drinks are reasonably priced for the place ($ 5 a big beer). Only downside: windows not very clean (end of the day?) What complicated the taking of photos ...

<text>(Translated by Google) The highest point in Los Angeles, with a good view, especially when the sun is setting, it feels better. The wings for taking pictures are like flying wings for this building, enough to attract tourists to take pictures. Tips: There are two platforms upstairs, just across the restaurant, I realized when I was about to leave that I missed a nice sunset.

洛杉矶最高点，视野不错，特别是在夕阳西下的时候，感觉更棒。那个拍照片的翅膀就像是给这座大楼插上了腾飞的翅膀，足够吸引游客来次拍照。tips：楼上有两个平台，穿过餐厅就是，我竟然在要离开的时候才发现，错过了很好的夕阳。<//text><rating>4</rating>< user>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Wonderful experience at the OUE Skyspace, one of the tallest skyscrapers in Los Angeles (be careful, not the highest). The entrance costs a little ($ 25 only to enter) but it is absolutely worth it, because from this rooftop you will have the chance to admire Los Angeles in its majesty, with its hills on one side and the ocean on the other . Spectacular! At the top there is a bar where they serve everything, from craft beer to fine wines, from classic sweet to more complex ones (obviously only high prices, but the pleasure of enjoying a good glass of high-altitude wine is priceless).

(Original)
Bellissima esperienza all'OUE Skyspace, uno dei grattacieli più alti di Los Angeles (attenzione, non il più alto). L'ingresso costa un po' (25 dollari solo per accedere) però ne vale assolutamente la pena, perché da questo rooftop avrete la possibilità di ammirare Los Angeles nella sua maestosità, con le sue colline da un lato e l'oceano dall'altro. Spettacolare! In cima è presente un bar dove servono di tutto, dalla birra artigianale ai vini pregiati, dai classici dolci a quelli più complessi (ovviamente i prezzi solo alti, ma il piacere di gustarti un buon calice di vino in quota non ha prezzo).< /Review>< pictures>

I suggest going at dusk to see the city from above on the traditional flat roofs of L.A. (the roofs of L.A. are flat because once they had to allow the landing of helicopters by law) and to be able to take pictures with both the brightness of the day and the oxen of the evening with the city illuminated by the thousand and more lights. Experience for the daredevils the slide suspended in the void! Funny, not essential. Don't leave without taking the photo on the wings of the artist Colette Miller

Semplicemente... Wow. Suggerisco di andare in orario crepuscolo così da vedere la città dall'alto sui tradizionali tetti piatti di L.A. (i tetti di L.A. sono piatti perchè una volta dovevano per legge consentire l'atterraggio agli elicotteri) e poter far le foto sia con la luminosità del giorno che con il buoi della sera con la città illuminata dalle mille e più luci. Esperienza per i temerari lo scivolo sospeso nel vuoto! Divertente, non indispensabile.

(Translated by Google) The tallest building in Los Angeles. In the evening arriving just to see the sunset, a lot of people, there are bar scene DJ can look at the scenery changed side drink, very chill ~ can see the 360-degree city views, pictures are beautiful.
There are tickets to play SLIDE, because just slip floor, jeer at it too, a little expensive - but very special, the entire SLIDE is transparent, a little nervous before sliding down

(Original)
洛杉磯最高的樓。在傍晚的時候抵達剛好可以看到日落，人很多，現場有DJ也有酒吧可以變看風景邊小酌，很chill~可以看到360度市景，拍照也漂亮。
有購票玩溜滑梯，因為只是溜一層樓，咻一下就過了，有點貴～不過很特別，整個溜滑梯是透明的，滑下去之前有點緊張< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Fantastic panorama, very courteous staff, the slide is not worth the effort, however, it is too fast for you to enjoy the excitement or the view ... In some places the glass is a little dirty and in the photos you see a little 'the halos .... But I realize that it is not easy to keep them flawless ... The cost is a bit high $ 25 plus tax just to go up to the 70th floor

Fantastico panorama, personale molto cortese, lo scivolo però non vale proprio la pena, è troppo veloce perché tu ti possa godere l'emozione o il panorama... In alcuni punti il vetro è un po' sporco e nelle foto si vedono un po' gli aloni.... Ma mi rendo conto che non sia facile mantenerli impeccabili... Il costo è un po' alto 25 $ più tasse solo per salire al 70 esimo piano< /Text></record>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is an observation deck that has recently emerged as a hot spot. In the past, Infinite Challenge came and filmed. It is famous for the glass slide experience as a place where you can enjoy the panoramic view of LA.
We recommend visiting once when you come to LA.
It is also a convenient place to visit by public transport.

최근 핫한 장소로 뜨고 있는 전망대입니다. 예전 무한도전이 와서 촬영도 했고요. LA 전경을 맘껏 볼 수 있는 곳으로 유리로된 슬라이드 체험이 유명해요.
LA 여행오면 한번 방문하시길 추천합니다.
대중교통으로도 방문하기 편한곳입니다.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFjZpwqHU5sfpGA2YxziWkakbAOgOuvncEQsjy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO20FMPF7CScc2bVoDRXCm6B_XGmo0inamJd8yw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMb1di0nvu9E35PyeYmcBRENamX_k4Uky_m5iqy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ2ufXTkCNtCJtpR8Wt-NouMCTs_jqNss9b-Ha=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) A nice place to enjoy the city from above. Of course, the ticket is not cheap ($ 25) and in addition they also offer a slide for $ 6 more than, in my opinion, not worth doing, it is 5 or 6 meters of transparent slide. If you want to take some nice pictures or wait for the sunset on one of the sofas on the terraces, sipping a drink can be worth it.

(Original)
Un bel posto in cui godere della i sta dall'alto della città. Certo, il biglietto non è economico(25$) e in più propongono anche uno scivolo per 6$ in più che, a mio avviso, non vale la pena fare, si tratta di 5 o 6 metri di scivolo trasparente. Se volete fare qualche bella foto o aspettare il tramonto su uno dei divanetti sulle terrazze sorseggiando un drink può valerne la pena.<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Seeing the night scene from the daytime view of the daytime, overlooking Los Angeles is really beautiful. It is brought up by the Los Angeles go card, so there is no need to buy a ticket, and it also includes a slide. It is highly recommended. Although there are many people, the space is also Very big, there is a beautiful angel wings glass painting can take pictures, but it is necessary to line up.

(Original)
從白天日景看到晚上夜景，俯瞰洛杉磯真的很漂亮，是用洛杉磯go card上來的，所以不用特地買票，還包含溜滑梯一次，非常推薦這張卡，上面雖然人很多，但空間也非常的大，還有一個漂亮的天使翅膀玻璃彩繪可以拍照，但要排隊就是了。</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) A must to visit! Very worth it! We were there on a Saturday and they had the Special Victims for families. 20 US dollars + tax per person (slide and a drink included in the price. Otherwise around 38 US dollars (I think). We spent several hours there. You see the whole LA. The slide was WOW!

(Translated by Google) Incredible place with 360 ° view of town wheel.
Getting out of the building slipping is sensational. There are also selfie options on interactive TVs.
Elevator goes up to floor 54 is after you take another leg up to floor 70.
Sophisticated and welcoming atmosphere with several sofas and chairs. Even on the outside. Entry 25 $ and with the slide plus 8 $.

Lugar incrível com vista 360° de roda cidade.
Sair do prédio escorregando então é sensacional. Também tem opções de selfies em TVs interativas.

Ambiente sofisticado e bem acolhedor com vários sofás e cadeiras. Inclusive na parte externa. Entrada 25$ e com o escorregador mais 8$.</review>

(Translated by Google) Sweet place, overlooking the 70th floor, overlooking LA
It has a slide to slide from the seventieth floor to the 69th floor
Sunset is sweet, with internal and external sessions
And an internal coffee and sandwiches
The place is nice and it is useful to photograph, but the prices are exaggerated
The slide is not included in the entry price

(Original)
مكان حلو تطلع الدور ال ٧٠ ومطل على LA
فيه زحليقة تتزحلق من الدور السبعين إلى الدور ال ٦٩
حلو وقت الغروب فيه جلسات داخلية وخارجية
وقهوه داخليه وساندوتشات
المكان حلو وينفع تصوير بس مبالغ بالأسعار
الزحليقة غير مشمولة بسعر الدخول< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I made a reservation a few weeks ago and only had time on the day, but unfortunately it rained. When I show the ticket barcode from below, it asks if it's going to go up when it doesn't appear. (Maybe I asked to change the date) On the way to the observatory, there is a little bit of fun and a video explaining the story or a secret behind LA. The observation deck floor was very clean and stylish. The staff were also very friendly.

몇 주전에 예약하고 당일밖에 시간이 안났는데 불행하게도 비가 왔습니다. 밑에서 티켓 바코드를 보여줄때도 비가 와서 안보이는데 올라가겠냐고 물어봅니다. (아마도 날짜를 바꿔주려고 물어본거 같습니다) 전망대까지 가는길에 LA에 숨은 이야기나 이모저모들 설명하는 영상과 조금의 즐길거리가 있습니다. 전망대 층은 아주 깔끔하고 세련됐습니다. 직원들도 아주 친절했습니다.< /Text>< time>

Those who want to see LA from above should do so on the OUE Skyspace LA. From there you get the best view over LA, even to the mountains and the coastal regions.

There is a point deduction for the slightly high price per person ($ 25). If you want to use the glass slide that goes from the 25 to the 24 floor may put another whole ($ 8) on it.
And if you have not spent enough in the end, you can treat yourself to a snack, a beer or something else in the Skybar on the 25th floor. On the ground floor one is then lured once again with expensive souvenirs to pull the last money out of the bag.

But who wants to enjoy a fabulous view and shoot great photos that is still right!

(Original)
Ein muss!
Wer LA von oben ansehen möchte sollte das auf dem OUE Skyspace LA tun. Von dort bekommt man den besten Ausblick über LA, sogar auf die Berge und die Küstenregionen.

Einen Punkt Abzug gibt es für den etwas zu hohen Preis pro Person (25$). Wer die Glas Rutsche benutzen möchte die vom 25 in den 24 Stockwerk geht darf noch einmal ganze (8$) drauf legen.
Und wer am Ende dann noch nicht genug ausgegeben hat, kann sich in der Skybar im 25 Stockwerk noch einen Snack, Bier oder sonst was gönnen. Im Erdgeschoss wird man dann noch einmal mit teuren Souvenirs gelockt um das letzte Geld aus der Tasche zu ziehen.

Wer aber einen sagenhaften Ausblick genießen möchte und tolle Fotos schießen will der ist hier dennoch richtig!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv-adAdYx84Sul9wIYJ34Df2xrGFahqgiu5zyL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPEbfAHdupY6W-GI-NT__L5evbyXf6x8kfLu5a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) Fantastic panorama, very courteous staff, the slide is not worth the effort, however, it is too fast for you to enjoy the excitement or the view ... In some places the glass is a little dirty and in the photos you see a little 'the halos .... But I realize that it is not easy to keep them flawless ... The cost is a bit high $ 25 plus tax just to go up to the 70th floor

(Original)
Fantastico panorama, personale molto cortese, lo scivolo però non vale proprio la pena, è troppo veloce perché tu ti possa godere l'emozione o il panorama... In alcuni punti il vetro è un po' sporco e nelle foto si vedono un po' gli aloni.... Ma mi rendo conto che non sia facile mantenerli impeccabili... Il costo è un po' alto 25 $ più tasse solo per salire al 70 esimo piano< /review>

(Translated by Google) The tallest building in the city of Los Angeles.

I recommend the visit if you want to enjoy the views of such an extensive city. The ticket is not very expensive and can be purchased online.

My recommendation is to buy the slide pass. Although it is a brief experience I think it is worth it to do the grace. Not every day one can pull a glass slide and thousands of meters high.

The views are beautiful. Worth the visit. Also in the store they sell a lot of merchandising in the city. It is expensive, by the way.

(Original)
El edificio más alto de la ciudad de Los Angeles.

Recomiendo la visita si se quiere disfrutar de las vistas de una ciudad tan extensa. No es muy cara la entrada y se puede comprar online.

Mi recomendación es que compren el pase del tobogán. Aunque es una experiencia breve creo que vale la pena por hacer la gracia. No todos los días una puede tirarse de un tobogán de cristal y miles de metros de altura.

Las vistas son bonitas. Merece la pena la visita. Además en la tienda venden mucho merchandising de la ciudad. Es cara, por cierto.< /review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The scenery is really nice.
Should you go to Los Angeles!

Buy a ticket at the reception on the first floor and climb by the elevator.
There was also a souvenir shop.

景色が本当にいいです。
ロスにきたら行くべき！

一階の受付でチケットを買ってエレベーターで登ります。
お土産屋も併設されていました。</Review>

For the shadow of the dream angel wing, you must pick it up before dusk, drink a cup of 嘢, really sigh.

👉 Try on the sky slide, it will take a few seconds, too short

呢個係我嘅重點項目之一。
為咗影超夢幻 angel wing， 必須喺黃昏之前嚟到 ，飲杯嘢添，真係非常嘆 😍。
喺觀景台睇埋加州嘅日落，仲有璀璨嘅夜景。wonderful night。

(Translated by Google) Sweet place, overlooking the 70th floor, overlooking LA
It has a slide to slide from the seventieth floor to the 69th floor
Sunset is sweet, with internal and external sessions
And an internal coffee and sandwiches
The place is nice and it is useful to photograph, but the prices are exaggerated
The slide is not included in the entry price

(Original)
مكان حلو تطلع الدور ال ٧٠ ومطل على LA
فيه زحليقة تتزحلق من الدور السبعين إلى الدور ال ٦٩
حلو وقت الغروب فيه جلسات داخلية وخارجية
وقهوه داخليه وساندوتشات
المكان حلو وينفع تصوير بس مبالغ بالأسعار
الزحليقة غير مشمولة بسعر الدخول< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Admission is expensive once. About 26 dollars. There's a glass slide from Infinite Challenge, which costs a little over $ 12 per person.
Still, the view is amazing. Go go about Sunset Bora turned off completely be good for night view

(Original)
일단 입장료가 비쌉니다. 26불정도. 무한도전에 나온 유리도 된 슬라이드가 있는데 잠깐 타는데 인당 12불이라는 엄청난 가격.
그래도 뷰는 엄청 좋습니다. 해질녘쯤가서 야경꺼지 보라 가면 완전 좋을듯<//Text>

(Translated by Google) A beautiful skyline of LA, the highest in California. Worth seeing the lights of the city at night on the terrace chill out

The price is quite high:
- ($ 26) the general input
- ($ 8) skydive

Does not include drinks or photo.

(Translated by Google) View of Los Angeles from the top. Cool but it doesn't compare to the view of Chicago or NY. $ 26 per person I found expensive. LA usually has a fog covering the city so you have to be lucky for the weather to help.

(Translated by Google) The slide is a little disappointing: 4 seconds of sliding to enjoy the thrill, but the feeling of vertigo guaranteed! the view of LA is perfect, the gaze carries very far on the horizon!
A good part of the 69th and 70th floors consists of a gallery of images relating to all the films in which the Skyspace tower appears.

<Rate>5</Rate><text>(Translated by Google) Walking through Bunker's Hill Steps, the space on the 54th to 70th floors of the US Bank Tower became a key project for LA tourism, except for being bombed by aliens in ID4, after tomorrow and after the California earthquake. The tower that fell off the LA and the second tallest tower enjoys the ultimate scenery. You can also slip through a transparent slide from the 70th floor to the 69th floor within 5 seconds.

走過Bunker’s Hill Steps，這個在US Bank Tower上54樓到70樓的空間變成了LA旅遊的重點項目，除了藉由這棟在ID4中被外星人炸掉、明天過後和加州大地震中被震倒掉、LA第二高的塔來享有極致風景外，還可以額外溜個透明滑梯從70樓5秒鐘以內滑到69樓轉瞬間就結束；70樓的觀景台和Lounge想待多久就待多久，也提供簡單的調酒和食物。<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Many pictures were taken near the building and the terrace was well decorated. The slide is worth a shot.
I went around 4 pm and took a picture and slided for about an hour.
The entrance fee is $ 25 for adults and $ 8 for a one-time slide ticket.

건물 근처에서 사진찍을 곳도 많고 건물 테라스도 잘꾸며져있었다. 슬라이드는 한번 타볼만하다.

성인 입장료는 25불이며 슬라이드 1회권이 8불이라 33불에 즐거운 시간을 보낼 수 있었다.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a spectacular place where you can observe the whole city, as well as enjoy a sunset, you can order a beer or a drink to enjoy the time you are up, there is parking around you, you can take photos, you pay to climb but it is worth it If you are afraid of heights, try it, as you can gradually approach the panoramic area or observe from the bar. There are small tables and chairs to have a good time. If I would come back.

(Original)
Es un lugar espectacular donde puedes observar toda la ciudad, así como disfrutar un atardecer, puedes pedir una cerveza o alguna bebida para disfrutar el tiempo que te encuentras arriba, hay estacionamiento a su alrededor, puedes tomar fotos, pagas por subir pero vale la pena, si tienes miedo a las alturas inténtalo, ya que te puedes ir acercando poco a poco al área panorámica u observar desde el bar. Hay pequeñas mesas y sillas para pasártela bien. Si regresaría.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) It's really nicely done and the staff is very accommodating. I have to subtract one star because there is a slide (made of acrylic glass) that is about 10 m long and costs about $ 20 to use it ... I just have to subtract the second star because LA is just really boring from above. You have a couple of skyscrapers and that's it. Ok, that's not what the OUE can do for that, it's just a fact.

(Original)
Es ist wirklich lieb gemacht, und das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend. Einen Stern muss ich abziehen, weil es dort eine Rutsche gibt (aus Acrylglas) die ca 10 m lang ist und ungefähr 20$ kostet um sie zu benutzen... Den zweiten Stern muss ich einfach abziehen weil LA von oben einfach echt langweilig ist. Man hat ein paar Hochhäuser und das wars. Ok, dafür kann das OUE nichts, es ist einfach ein Fakt.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Highly recommended, a must for everyone who is in Los Angeles for the first time. During the day you can of course see very far, you can see the Hollywood sign and even the sea. In the evening when it is dark it looks almost even more spectacular - with the sunset. On the outside of the building, on the 70th floor, there is a small glass slide through which you can slide down a floor. The only negative point: long wait until you are up. It was over half an hour in December, but it's worth the wait!

(Original)
Absolut empfehlenswert, ein muss für alle die das erste Mal in Los Angeles sind. Tagsüber sieht man natürlich sehr weit, man sieht das Hollywood-sign und sogar das Meer. Am Abend wen es dunkel ist sieht es fast noch spektakulärer aus - mit dem Sonnenuntergang. Aussen am Gebäude, im 70. Stock gibt es eine kleine Rutsche aus Glas, durch die man einen Stock hinunter rutschen kann. Einziger negativer Punkt: lange Wartezeit bis man oben ist. Im Dezember dauerte es schon über eine halbe Stunde, aber die Wartezeit lohnt sich!< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>(Translated by Google) The tower is really high. Los Angeles video at a glance.
The idea of ​​"sky slide", it seems to me, does not justify itself - a very small sliding path in a glass tube (up to 10 meters).
At OUE, photo and selfie spots are well thought out, including those with brightly colored wings. There are 2 balconies in the fresh air, sheathed around the perimeter with glass.
There are interactive exhibits about the most famous landmarks.

(Original)
Башня реально высокая. Лос Анджелес видео как на ладони.
Идея "sky slide", мне кажется, себя не оправдывает - очень небольшой путь скольжения в стеклянной трубе (до 10 метров).
В OUE хорошо продуманы места для фото и селфи, в том числе с нарисованными яркими крыльями. Здесь 2 балкона на свежем воздухе, обшитые по периметру стеклом.
Есть интерактивные экспонатов о самых известных достопримечательностях.< /Text></record>

(Translated by Google) The tallest skyscraper in LA, Bar serves well but is no big deal, worth the visit for the beautiful view of the city.

(Translated by Google) Walking through Bunker's Hill Steps, the space on the 54th to 70th floors of the US Bank Tower became a key project for LA tourism, except for being bombed by aliens in ID4, after tomorrow and after the California earthquake. The tower that fell off the LA and the second tallest tower enjoys the ultimate scenery. You can also slip through a transparent slide from the 70th floor to the 69th floor within 5 seconds. The 70th floor observation deck and Lounge want to stay for a long time. It will take a long time to provide simple bartending and food.

(Original)
走過Bunker’s Hill Steps，這個在US Bank Tower上54樓到70樓的空間變成了LA旅遊的重點項目，除了藉由這棟在ID4中被外星人炸掉、明天過後和加州大地震中被震倒掉、LA第二高的塔來享有極致風景外，還可以額外溜個透明滑梯從70樓5秒鐘以內滑到69樓轉瞬間就結束；70樓的觀景台和Lounge想待多久就待多久，也提供簡單的調酒和食物。</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Many pictures were taken near the building and the terrace was well decorated. The slide is worth a shot.
I went around 4 pm and took a picture and slided for about an hour.
The entrance fee is $ 25 for adults and $ 8 for a one-time slide ticket.

건물 근처에서 사진찍을 곳도 많고 건물 테라스도 잘꾸며져있었다. 슬라이드는 한번 타볼만하다.
오후 4시쯤 가서 한시간쯤 사진찍고 슬라이드타니까 일몰시간이 되어 일몰도 보고 야경까지 보고 내려왔다.
성인 입장료는 25불이며 슬라이드 1회권이 8불이라 33불에 즐거운 시간을 보낼 수 있었다.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a spectacular place where you can observe the whole city, as well as enjoy a sunset, you can order a beer or a drink to enjoy the time you are up, there is parking around you, you can take photos, you pay to climb but it is worth it If you are afraid of heights, try it, as you can gradually approach the panoramic area or observe from the bar. There are small tables and chairs to have a good time. If I would come back.

Es un lugar espectacular donde puedes observar toda la ciudad, así como disfrutar un atardecer, puedes pedir una cerveza o alguna bebida para disfrutar el tiempo que te encuentras arriba, hay estacionamiento a su alrededor, puedes tomar fotos, pagas por subir pero vale la pena, si tienes miedo a las alturas inténtalo, ya que te puedes ir acercando poco a poco al área panorámica u observar desde el bar. Hay pequeñas mesas y sillas para pasártela bien. Si regresaría.</text><rating>5< /rating>< date>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Amazing view of the city of Los Angeles + a transparent slide from the 70th floor to the 6th edge. Instead of a display of the city's hysteria and the films that were made in it. Recommended place

תצפית מדהימה על העיר לוס אנגלס+ מגלשה שקופה מן הקומה ה 70 לקוצה ה 68. במקום תצוגה של ההסטטריה של העיר והסרטים אשר בוצעו בה. מקום מומלץ< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) beautiful overwiew over los angeles. I do not give 5 stars for the absolutely exaggerated price for both the climb and the slide (slide on the void). if you want to do everything, spend more than 30 dollars !!!! but it is absolutely worth dedicating 1 day to downtown !! the tower is very well kept and very clean. the silullabterrazza bar allows you to have a coffee looking at los angeles from above !!

Just a glass slide is really short, a few meters and for $ 8. Enter a classic US $ 25 plus a dollar fee or tax. But it's worth it.

Hezká vyhlídka, spousta drobností navíc (focení se ála hvězda a plno dalších zábavných možností) u přestupu v 54. patře, příjemné posezení s výhledem na Los Angeles na terase v 69 patře. Akorát prosklená skluzavka je fakt kraťoučká, pár metrů a za 8 dolarů. Vstup klasicky americký 25 dolarů, plus dolar poplatek či daň. Ale stojí to za to.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

There is a slide made of glass, through which you can slide one floor down on the outside of the building. It's a very nice experience. However, you have to hurry to look into the depth, otherwise the ride is already over. But it is always fun and exciting.
The view is awesome. Highly Recommended.

(Original)
Absolut beeindruckend. Es gibt eine Rutsche aus Glas, durch die man außen am Gebäude eine Etage tiefer rutschen kann. Ist eine ganz nette Erfahrung. Allerdings muss man sich beeilen, in die Tiefe zu schauen, sonst ist der Ritt nämlich schon vorbei. Aber sorgt in jedem Fall für Spaß und Aufregung.
Die Aussicht ist genial. Absolut empfehlenswert.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) We lowed it. Fantastic view. Realy worth to go up there. Don't pay the slide! About 4-5 meters slide. I don't think it's worth 8 dollars. We went late afternoon in daylight and stood untill sunset! So enjoyed the view when the been turned on! We really liked it. It is not worth paying for the slide. Just a few feet and $ 8. Anyway, it's worth arriving a little later and then you can see Los Angeles both during the day and in the evening, because there is no time limit on how much you can be upstairs.

Amúgy kicsit később érdemes érkezni és akkor nappal is és esti fenyeknel is látni lehet Los Angelest ugyanis nincs idő korlát, hogy mennyit lehet fent lenni.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It is the tallest outdoor observatory in California at the US bank tower, the tallest floor in downtown.
You can enjoy a 360-degree view of Los Angeles from two observation decks.
Sky sliding, a transparent slide from the 70th to the 69th, is famous.

(Original)
다운타운  최고층인 US bank  타워에 있는 캘리포니아 주에서 가장 높은 야외 전망대이다.
2개의 전망대에서 로스앤젤레스의 전경을 360도로 감상할 수 있다.
70층에서 69층으로의 투명 미끄럼틀인 스카이  슬라이딩이 유명하다.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I visited several places with good views, but nothing compares to the view of this building.
The building itself is beautiful. The view is breathtaking. The slide is fast but very tasty.
Parking nearby is expensive and you don't spend a lot of time in the building, so if you find a parking meter it is worth investing for a 2-hour one.

(Original)
Visitei diversos locais com boas vistas, mas nada se compara a vista deste prédio.
O prédio em sim é lindo. A vista é de tirar o fôlego. O escorregador é rápido mas muito gostoso.
O estacionamento na redondeza é caro e você não fica muito tempo no prédio, então se achar algum parquímetro vale a pena investir de for aquele de 2 horas.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Here you have a spectacular 360-degree view from the 69th floor of the US Bank Tower in Los Angeles at an altitude of 305 meters. The 14-meter-long glass Skyslide slide from the 70th floor is also worthwhile. The best time of day to visit is at sunset. You have a great view of the illuminated city even in the dark.

(Original)
Hier hat man einen spektakuläre 360-Grad-Ausblick vom 69. Stock des US Bank Tower in Los Angeles in einer Höhe von 305 Metern. Die 14 Meter lange gläserne Skyslide-Rutsche vom 70. Stock ist ebenfalls lohnenswert. Die beste Tageszeit für einen Besuch ist zum Sonnenuntergang.  Man hat auch bei Dunkelheit einen tollen Ausblick auf die beleuchtete Stadt.<//Review>< name>

(Translated by Google) Unobstructed view of the city of L.A, two large terraces bay windows, only flats, the price (but everything is expensive in LA) and you can do the toboggan once

(Translated by Google) Nice place to take the kids to get to know the City "downtown LA". My son was surprised when I took him because we always passed downtown but never stayed to explore the area. Recommendations, go after 5 o'clock to avoid paying too much for parking. Outside the building there is ballet parking after 5pm $ 15. I paid $ 25. After 5 o'clock downtown parking lots are a bit cheap. Do not go when it is a regular week, a lot of traffic that despairs. Go weekdays oh holidays. Going one day after it rains is clearer.

(Original)
Bonito lugar para llevar  a los niños para que conoscan la Ciudad "downtown LA". Mi hijo se sorprendio  cuando lo lleve por que siempre pasabamos  por el downtown pero nunca nos quedabamos  a explorar  el area. Recomendaciones, ir  despues de las 5 para no pagar mucho  en parking. Afuera del edificio  hay ballet parking despues de las 5pm $15. Yo pague $25. Pasando  de las 5 los parqueaderos del downtown estan un poco baratos. No ir  cuando es semana regular, mucho trafico que desespera. Ir entre semana oh feriados. Ir un dia despues  que llueva se ve mas claro.</Text>

(Translated by Google) A place that breaks with everyday life and offers a spectacular view of the city of Los Angeles and the experience of sliding on a slide glass at a great height, the site also offers spaces for rent for events.

<Review>(Translated by Google) A very father point! 25 dlls the entrance plus 8dlls if you want to winnow by the slide (the slide is only 1 floor).
In general, it's very beautiful!

(Translated by Google) It's nothing fun, nor as seen in the photos, it was disappointing to go there.

(Translated by Google) The view that can be admired is breathtaking but in my opinion it is not worth $ 25, maybe I should have gone in the evening. The slide takes too little to experience an adrenaline-filled emotion.

Il panorama che si può ammirare è mozzafiato ma parer mio non vale 25$, forse sarei dovuto andare la sera. Lo scivolo dura troppo poco per provare un'emozione adrenalinica.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is impressive from the first moment to enter very beautiful buildings and then how they treat you and the entire route to get to the viewpoint is spectacular and also gives you the opportunity to understand a lot of the Los Angeles city skyline, impressive views and a traction what It is a shuttle and a slide at the highest height of the building. I have enjoyed it a lot and I have been able to see Los Angeles from another perspective with another look and another way of recommending it. You will have a great time.

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a super place to go for a walk. It is the tallest building in the city and has a viewpoint, restaurant, museum that accounts for the evolution of the city and the most interesting is a glass slide that floats high in Los Angeles. It is generally an extraordinarily place.

(Original)
Es un súper lugar para ir a pasear. Es el edifico más alto de la ciudad y cuenta con un un mirador, restaurante, museo que da cuenta del devenir de la ciudad y lo más interesan un tobogán de cristal que flota en lo alto de Los Ángeles. Es en general un extraordinariamente lugar.</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) If you are in LA do not miss this visit, before entering we were not sure why it is a bit expensive, but it is worth it, I recommend the sunset, since you can appreciate the city day and night, highly recommended!

(Original)
Si estás en LA no te pierdas esta visita, antes de entrar no estábamos seguros por qué es un tanto caro, pero vale la pena, recomiendo el atardecer, ya que se puede apreciar la ciudad de día y de noche, muy recomendable!<//Text>
