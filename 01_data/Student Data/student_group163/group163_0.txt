Brought my 10 yr old in for a lesson with karina. She was so kind and patient with my kid. The whole staff was friendly from the start which I truly appreciate. We'll definitely be back for more!<//Text>

Right off the bat. The staff is great. Very helpful. They’ve helped me with everything from servicing a broken cam piece to recently just putting Toghether a Pse ntn 33. Very happy with there customer service. There are closer bow shops to me but I’ll make the trip here. To get quality service at a great price.</text>

Great place for any stage of archery. They know what they're doing and wont steer you wrong. Craig was unbelievably helpful adjusting my new bow to fit me and sharing advice along the way. Ms Kylie (sorry if I'm wrong on her name) & the rest of the crew made it comfortable to walk in as a rookie slinger. Thank you Craig and all!! Customer for life! #SupportYourLocalBusiness< /review>

This place is epic!!! The guys at Riverside Archery have an answer for every question dealing with archery. They can get a hold of any bow within a reasonable time period, if they don't have it on the shelf. Mostly all work done on a bow is already quoted for. There is no hourly fee for tuning a bow like some places I have been too. Shooting on the range is always fun and the people I have met are so nice. Customer service is their #1 goal. They have lessons for all ages and skill levels which is great for a family or for the competitive archer.</review>

I wanted to get into bow hunting. I brought a used Mathews bow I bought at a pawn shop in to get looked at. Scott looked it over, gave me some guidance. Set me up with some arrows. I'm definitely going to get some lessons there.< /review>

I walked in this store a blank slate regarding archery and the guys here are more than helpful to educate and get you into archery. All it took for me was to shoot 2 arrows and im now a month in to the sport getting better each time. I can't iterate enough how helpful Evan, Scott, Ian, Kaylie and Craig were to all my needs. From form corrections/perfection to equipment tuning they got you covered. The dream of participating in the Vegas shoot and local tournaments gets closer with every practice visit to this store. Definitely a local gem! Thank you guys all so much! I support you 100%<//Text>

< Review>
Without a doubt THE place to go for anything archery-related in the Inland Empire. The variety of products, and their knowledge, is vast. In fact, I would advise anyone in Los Angeles to venture out here for their archery needs. Speak to Ian, he's the guy that took care of me and gave me a ton of advice and re-sized my arrows to just the right length. He signed me up for a range card, which is free and necessary to clock in and out with when using their indoor range. They start you off with a free $7 credit (equivalent to 1 hour range time) and you get another one on your birthday. Since my birthday was the day prior, Ian still gave it to me, so I started off with 2 free hours of range time on my card. This is awesome because I typically have time to kill after work waiting for traffic to die down. Like I stated, their service is awesome.

My only reason for not giving it a 5-star rating is that while Ian was working on my arrows, the news was on the TV and the president came on. One of the other staff members just couldn't hold in his personal opinions to himself and felt the need to shout them out to no one in particular (that was a bit weird). Regardless of any political leanings you may or may not have, this is just not professional, as it can be offensive to some. Not a deal-breaker, I'll still be going back, just an irksome moment in an otherwise perfect customer service experience.< /Review>

<text>The staff are super friendly, it's a safe environment, anyone there is happy to answer any questions you have, they've got a great selection of bows and arrows, and pretty much all the supplies you need for achery! And if they don't have something, they can probably get it for you, or tell you where you can find what you're looking for! They also provide really good lessons for all ages of varying experience!<//text>< Pictures>

They are now my primary source.

<Text>These guys are simply awesome!
I had purchased a high-end bow elsewhere and it was recommended by a good friend that I visit Riverside Archery to get it set up.  I came into their shop and was met by Chris Levai (sp?).  Chris not only works there, he is an obsessed archer.  Not ONCE, did anyone give me any kind of discomfort for not buying my bow from them.  Chris proceeded to set my bow up and tune it to perfection  He took EXTRA time to help me get comfortable with my setup (I am a slow learner)  and by the time I left the shop, I was shooting groups the size of a coffee can lid.   They have a HUGE assortment of bows and accessories from entry level to pro level.  They have an expert staff, and a great indoor range.  I can't say enough good about these guys and highly recommend you visit them if archery is your passion.  They even offered to let my kids shoot on the range to see if this was something they wanted to get into.

<rating>2< /rating><text>Beware if you plan on coming here, you will be taken advantage of, because they can, being that they are the only archery shop around. If you can make it to any other shop and are not forced to come here because of the distance I would advise that instead... A hand full of the people i've talked to have said that they have seen the decline of service of this place. Not sure if its been years in the making or just of late???
If you have to come here, see the asain guy or the shorter white guy with hat.<//text>< resp>

Why are they closed on Sundays and Mondays?! Those are my only days off work where I work 60 hours a week. Now i have to go all the way out to Chino Hills Turner's for anything archery that's worth a damn. I say that's worth a damn because Bass Pro is not worth a damn for archery except their tiny 30 yard, 2 lane range.< /review>

I have been to this store 3 times. First two trips were fact finding tours. These guys are great. First time I went on a Monday (they were closed) but Ian and Travis saw me out there and came out to talk with me and answered a lot of my questions. I am a beginner as in never shot before.

Second Trip, I came back from visiting a few other archery stores in the Orange county area and thought I had some idea of what I wanted. Bernie let me try out bows from beginning to advanced. Answered questions and gave me some shooting tips. At no point during any of this did they pressure me to buy or give many anything less that excellent service. I was there a few hours and did not purchase a thing.

Third trip I had nailed it down and once again wanted to shoot to particular bows for comparison. They again were very happy to help. This time I was being helped by Evan. I asked to shoot both bows on the range to have a further target and the obliged. I had made a choice. Of course I changed it the next day and finally placed the order.

4th Trip is today to pick up my bow and get accessories as well as shoot it. I will post another review to let you all know how today went, but I expect I will be satisfied as these guys have been great during this entire process. The just want me to be really happy with my purchase and archery as a whole.</Text>

<review>Read the reviews on here and I was a little skeptical at first. But, they were the only remotely close pro shop that had the bow I wanted in stock in the finish I wanted, so I called them on Saturday and had them hold it for me until I could go there the following Tuesday. So I made the 75 mile drive from Carlsbad. The area wasn't so enticing but it wasn't bad. Once they opened I was immediately helped while the worker started setting up for the day. I told them I was new, it was my first bow, and that they were supposed to be holding a bow for me. He new exactly what I was talking about and brought it out. As he took out the bow, he asked another customer what he needed. The other customer needed something fixed and it wouldn't take that long. I let the worker go ahead and start taking care of the other customer. At that point, the owner's son, Travis, came in. He took over helping me out from there. They measured my draw length and determined that the bow was already set for my draw length. Even then, Travis proceeded to re-Loctite all the screws on the Cams for me while showing me all the spots of the bow to keep an eye on and how to check them. After re-inspecting the bow to make sure everything looked good, he reset the draw weight, aligned the rest, grabbed some arrows and explained how to adjust the sight. He stayed with me and let me adjust my own sight to ensure I did it correctly. While I was sighting it in, he was giving me a crash course lesson on how to improve my stance and shot. By the time I finished adjusting me sights, I was shooting a 2-2.5" group dead center at 20 yards.
At that point, he showed me all the things I would need or would want to buy/replace. He was never pushy on getting me to buy anything, which is big for me.
I think another thing I noticed was that he was still professional and helpful regardless of the fact that he knew I wasn't from the area, and probably wouldn't be giving  much of my business.
Overall, if they were closer this would be my main place to go, but unfortunately that's not the case. I'm sure I'll still drop by on my way to Vegas.
Great shop with great guys and a nicer selection compared to what I've seen in southern california.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>It's been 25 years since I've touched a bow last.  Out of nowhere my beautiful wife says that she wants to give archery a try.  I was floored.  So we head over to Riverside Archery to check out what they had to offer.  The store was surprisingly busy for a Tuesday afternoon but still, we were greeted by Travis, the owner, who gave us almost two hours of his time picking out the right bows and personally adjusting them for us.  It took a couple of tries but he got it JUST RIGHT.  They have an archery range there within the store too and so they (Travis and Chris)  taught us how to shoot them properly.

About the store... archery is the only thing they do.  Their selection of bows ranges from the inexpensive to the very expensive ($1400) + used.  They have every accessory you can imagine and it is well staffed.  Everyone we came in contact with was ridiculously  helpful and enthusiastic about their jobs.  Travis was the stand-out among them but I also really liked Chris.

We ended up spending more than I expected but I did so happily.  If you haven't shot a bow in a while then it's worth checking out.  I did a lot of research before I bought.  After many wasted hours online I came to realize that this is not the kind of thing you can buy off eBay or at an online store.  You really need to be measured for your bow and have them adjust it so that the draw weight is comfortable.  I didn't expect to buy a Bowtech bow today but I followed their recommendations and am super pleased and can't wait to go out and play with my new toy.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcb210ee367a23:0x47fc4d1425881e24</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I'm honestly shocked to see ANY of these bad reviews, and I would love nothing more that to slap the whiney babies that talk down this GREAT shop!

Both my girlfriend and I are new to archery, and after months of searching for the perfect bow both online and in personal tests, I decided on a Bowtech, the only problem is, Riverside archery were the only ones that had it is stock! So, I drove 2 hours both ways from Ventura county to find my perfect bow.

I can't say enough how pleased I was when I got there, NEVER was I treated like an amateur (and being a macho male, I tend to feel that way easily in new environments), NEVER was I talked down to, and NEVER did I or my girlfriend feel uncomfortable at any point being in the store. Not only did both the owner and his son treat us with GRADE A service, but fellow patrons using the archery range with years of experience made me feel at home by sharing stories, adding shooting tips, and making us both feel confident in our beginning levels.

Overall, both of us were super happy leaving the store, I got my bow, and my girlfriend had her eyes opened to different shooting choices that she never considered (We almost left owning two bows, until I convinced her to cool her jets). I give these guys a 10/10, and only wish they were closer to my home, I'd go shooting there every day if I could. The few hours of them teaching and instructing, was more productive than the MONTH I've been going to archery clubs on the weekend.

If you have a stick up your A#$ and like to make bad reviews, pull it out, sharpen it, add some feathers, and shoot it from a bow at Riverside Archery, you won't regret it!<//text>

What the hell.. I just got off the phone with riverside archery. I am wanting to buy 4 PSE Kingfishers and was wanting to partner with them to send then business. I asked what they can do for a price and Ean said 160.00 WTF.. I can buy it from Cabela's or Bass Pro for 139.99.. This is why the small shops go out of business!< /Text>

Awesome experience. Levi really knows his stuff. He’s always improving his sound with new techniques and new equipment. I highly recommend to anybody that need good mixes.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Beware, this place is terrible. No air conditioning and many of the rooms have no windows so expect to bake during the summer. The elevator is narrow and often broke. There is usually trash left around the front door which is sometimes left propped open by tenants without a key so anyone could wander in. The entire place sometimes smells like sewage.
The back parking lot of the building seems to be favored by locals for illicit activities. Either for drug deals or a fight club, it's unknown but most nights, a run down car will be sitting by the side of the building as a "look out" with access to the back roped off for their crew. Having made the mistake of parking back there earlier in the day, you do not want to be stuck with your car left amongst these guys at night when they are operating.
Overall this is a dirty, shady place which is overpriced. You can find cheaper, cleaner and better rehearsal studios elsewhere in LA.< /Text>< Pics>

A collective of small mainly music studio spaces. You can hear people practicing in the rooms. My friend is teaching me how to mix and scratch and play drums<//Text>

Decent reversal spaces, cleaner than others I've practiced at in the past and if you share a space with another band its really affordable.</Review>

< Review>
Easy and fun on-boarding and orientation, I don't see what all the negative fuss is about. Racism? Over half of us in my orientation class were minorities. Complaining about having to turn in your paperwork in person and not via email? So what? Why are you trying to hide your identity from them? Sketchy you are!

I've worked for a few different security companies and I am here to stay. Great management and structure.< /Review>

<Text>Haven’t been here a long time and it’s already annoying. Keep having to go to these far locations for paperwork instead of letting you email it to them. You have to physically go there and take them a copy of your direct depositbut they can have like four different classrooms video chat across the cities with each other to do one orientation. American guard is not the best but at least they weren’t giving me the run around even when i told them i had limited transportation. I applied for a specific location for a reason. Not to be forced to ride to the other side of town every One of two days off i get.<//Text><user>110792108148073474619</user>< time>

How's it going been working with this company for some time and I could say they definitely do accommodate you indpay as a flex officer I have no idea why people are saying that it's a bad job site I as an employee here at securitas really enjoy my job the dispatch team is the best Carter Rachel and Daryl are really awesome people and very responsive every time I call the hours are definitely there the pay is definitely there and the managers are the best for scheduling if there's individuals out there that are just mad don't take it out on the team most people are good people and not to forget George Nunez if you get a Time scheduler manager definitely work with him this guy is on top of it don't hesitate apply apply</Review>

If you didn't get hired didn't get an orientation it was probably cuz you weren't properly dressed and didn't shave or weren't fit for the job or there just waiting on the process. this company highly takes care of itself and it's co workers sadly too many worksites judge the security officers a little too fast without questioning the fact if the security officer is possibly writing down notes on its phone which is by the way a company phone and we do live in the 20th century so we do use technology nowadays when you find co-workers inside vehicles it's possibly because they're charging their phones for emergency cases when needed to call 911 which does commonly happen but most sites  would just like to judge nor question the officer himself do this company a favor don't shoot the guards down the bus for doing their jobs just so you can get a discount at the end be straight up I know co-workers who work here and really try hard to represent the company and they do a great job we had one working at Northgate market over at Long Beach and Hawthorne for graveyard and he stays up the whole night standing no lunch just bathroom breaks I'm sure there's a few bad apples but securitas is definitely stepping it up in guarding the company sites as needed</review>

There’s a old asian lady doing interviews, and she is bad news. Will straight up judge you and not give you a chance. She might be racist. She’s the first door on the right-hand side. Hope this company goes down the drain because of her.<//text>

This company just denied me a job which they called me to see when I could work. Due to me in taking marijuana from a recent incident the female denies me the job even tho i said I'd be fine next month,its temporary . She denied me so quick I couldnt even really explain and from the judgement in her voice it sounded like personal judgement and not within the company policy itself.  It's legal and I do not do drugs  it's something suggested to my doctor due to my pain and I'll be fine next month  I chose it and since it helped me sleep at night (I work grave)  I said why not.  I got guard card,driver, 9mm,pepper ,CPR 10yr experiance and supervision experiance and may I add worked along side. Undercover lapd for things I cant disclose.      Their loss...they should hire someone that doesent let their personal opinion effect their judgement and job.< /review>

< Review>
Received a call for a job so I Called back to inquire about the position and was told very rudely hold on a second then put on hold much longer than that. I could tell she was just trying to ignore me. What kind of losers do they hire for the hr department!!!
They need to figure out who’s in the hiring department they don’t know anything about respect.
They need to figure out. What the heck is wrong with these people.
Then tried to say when we review your application you’ll receive a call back!!!

What I was already called prior to me calling by the same rude lady I talked to!

This lady is so ridiculous!!!!

Don’t work for this company they obviously don’t care about there employees or who they hire.

They need people skills and proper communication skills

Don’t waste your time with these cowards.!!!!

The incompetence in these people is at a all time high level of stupidity!!!!

Stay away and avoid them at all costs!

Don’t contract or work for them ever!!!<//Review>

Terrible phone skills from the "receptionist" HR staff is awful here. Who gives interviews in a t shirt a d stretchy pants, I'll tell you who, unprofessional people do.  That's the kind of crap you deal with here. Exactly why you should never promote based on seniority.</Text>

Easy and fun on-boarding and orientation, I don't see what all the negative fuss is about. Racism? Over half of us in my orientation class were minorities. Complaining about having to turn in your paperwork in person and not via email? So what? Why are you trying to hide your identity from them? Sketchy you are!

I've worked for a few different security companies and I am here to stay. Great management and structure.</review>

<Review>Haven’t been here a long time and it’s already annoying. Keep having to go to these far locations for paperwork instead of letting you email it to them. You have to physically go there and take them a copy of your direct depositbut they can have like four different classrooms video chat across the cities with each other to do one orientation. American guard is not the best but at least they weren’t giving me the run around even when i told them i had limited transportation. I applied for a specific location for a reason. Not to be forced to ride to the other side of town every One of two days off i get.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>If you didn't get hired didn't get an orientation it was probably cuz you weren't properly dressed and didn't shave or weren't fit for the job or there just waiting on the process. this company highly takes care of itself and it's co workers sadly too many worksites judge the security officers a little too fast without questioning the fact if the security officer is possibly writing down notes on its phone which is by the way a company phone and we do live in the 20th century so we do use technology nowadays when you find co-workers inside vehicles it's possibly because they're charging their phones for emergency cases when needed to call 911 which does commonly happen but most sites  would just like to judge nor question the officer himself do this company a favor don't shoot the guards down the bus for doing their jobs just so you can get a discount at the end be straight up I know co-workers who work here and really try hard to represent the company and they do a great job we had one working at Northgate market over at Long Beach and Hawthorne for graveyard and he stays up the whole night standing no lunch just bathroom breaks I'm sure there's a few bad apples but securitas is definitely stepping it up in guarding the company sites as needed<//Text>< pictures>

This company just denied me a job which they called me to see when I could work. Due to me in taking marijuana from a recent incident the female denies me the job even tho i said I'd be fine next month,its temporary . She denied me so quick I couldnt even really explain and from the judgement in her voice it sounded like personal judgement and not within the company policy itself.  It's legal and I do not do drugs  it's something suggested to my doctor due to my pain and I'll be fine next month  I chose it and since it helped me sleep at night (I work grave)  I said why not.  I got guard card,driver, 9mm,pepper ,CPR 10yr experiance and supervision experiance and may I add worked along side. Undercover lapd for things I cant disclose.      Their loss...they should hire someone that doesent let their personal opinion effect their judgement and job.</Text>

< Review>
Received a call for a job so I Called back to inquire about the position and was told very rudely hold on a second then put on hold much longer than that. I could tell she was just trying to ignore me. What kind of losers do they hire for the hr department!!!
They need to figure out who’s in the hiring department they don’t know anything about respect.
They need to figure out. What the heck is wrong with these people.
Then tried to say when we review your application you’ll receive a call back!!!

What I was already called prior to me calling by the same rude lady I talked to!

This lady is so ridiculous!!!!

Don’t work for this company they obviously don’t care about there employees or who they hire.

They need people skills and proper communication skills

Don’t waste your time with these cowards.!!!!

The incompetence in these people is at a all time high level of stupidity!!!!

Stay away and avoid them at all costs!

Don’t contract or work for them ever!!!< /Review>

Ordered the spicy cashew chicken with rice dish, tasted great!  Had a good amalgam of flavor, from salty, sweet, meaty...just perfect balance.  Meat was cooked to a good texture and portion was filling.  Great customer service, and clean environment.  Their water is green tea ice water!  Never had the pleasure of that before.  This has quickly become my favorite thai place in Los Angels right now.< /text>

I like traditional Thai Food and this is definitely what Thai Noodle House & BBQ offers. From friendly staff to remarkable robust thai flavors. It treated me very well. I'm fortunate to live right down the street from here. I will come back again.</text>

Outstanding spot for Thai food. I give this spot a thumbs up. Had a friend come into town and asked me to take him here again. The prices are fair for the quality of food.< /Review>

We came in around the time they were about to close but they still welcomed us with warm smiles & great service! We ordered Thai tea boba, a smoothie, salmon teriyaki, & pad see ew & everything we had was delicious! If you’re looking for authentic Thai food, come visit this place! It reminds me so much of when we go on vacation to Southeast Asia. It is a family run restaurant so be kind & patient with the workers as they speak broken English, but that’s when you know the food is REAL good & 100% authentic! :)< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Excellent. I go there often when I work. I'm the Security Officer who works in the area Monday to Friday nights. From the employees, customer service, cleanliness of the restaurant, to the food is top notch service. Go and check them out. You will be satisfied.<//Text>

I eat here quite often. The pineapple curry is delicious and full of flavor. I've had thai food all over riverside and surrounding cities and this place is in the top. They're courteous and concerning when it comes to my satisfaction. Their peanut sauce for the spring rolls is excellent. The tofu is always cooked perfect too. Thanks for the great service.</Review>

Nice prices, small portions, B grade for health, dirty cups, they give you only half a cup of soda when you order a drink, food tasted great though. Just kinda eww I guess  but atleast the food was alright and made fast.</review>

This used to be a great affordable place but i think it may have gone under new management. More than once they have messed up my orders now. They are closest to my house but it may be worth making the drive elsewhere.</review>

<name>Robyn Thomas< /name>< Review>
Finally a Thai restaurant in Riverside that serves genuine fresh Thai spring rolls (could use a bit more lemony basil) but otherwise awesome. Pay the extra for fresh shrimp x2. You get 3 pcs rolls per order and they were big! Satay was good, not dry with perfect peanut sauce and really good cucumber sauce.

They also offer common Chinese cuisine including orange chicken - tender, fresh and not over candied.

We did not love the chicken teriyaki was so so.

All and all, good quality,quantity. A bit pricey but I have paid as much for awful food. This is really good

Used Grubhub, from Oder to delivery (hot) 38 miniutes! And accurate (so rare).

Thanks!!!

The food was bad due to mismanagement of the owner. Owner need to cut the selection of menu by 80%. No authencity and nothing special. Too much salt on the food. Pricy and slow service. The owners need to focus either they want to be a thai or chinese restaurant.</Review>< pictures>

This place has come a long way since the day's I used to come here when I was young.The businesses have returned and the undesirable have moved on. This is a great thing for the community which surrounds this location. A big thank you goes out to Ethan Conrad properties for all the hard work they have put into it.</Text>

I shop at Grocery Outlet all the time. I give the overall Arcade 4 stars, but grocery outlet 5 stars. Only draw back is the parking lot can get packed when it's busy. Wish it was a tad bigger.<//text>

Just because someone drives into a parking lot where there are multiple stores why do you want a review for just one? I don't know anything about the shop you want the review for.< /review>

This place has some great stores and is often busy. But the homeless and drug users make it a little uneasy being there.</text>

For me, the biggest reason this place gets 5 stars (besides the delicious food) is the cleanliness. I chatted with the cashier and she mentioned how much the owner likes to keep the place clean, and it shows. The dining area was practically spotless and the staff cleaned up as soon as a mess was present. Typically, hole-in-the-wall places can look pretty sloppy or dusty, but not here. If cleanliness is your jam, I recommend here for sure.

Now, onto the food. I got the Shrimp a la Diabla Burrito because I love spicy, but oh man that is a spicy burrito, even for me. I still loved it and it was delicious, but just a warning to make sure you can handle your spice before you bite into one of those. Also, I can't go to a Mexican restaurant without sampling their fish tacos and this one was no exception. One of the best fish tacos I've tried. Try the variety of their salsas too.

I definitely can't wait to go back here next time I'm down in San Diego.<//text>

This place is a rip off. My first time in the area and I stopped in for lunch. I got two items. The first was a shrimp quesadilla. First thing and shrimp quesadilla is supposed to have shrimp in it. Only two shrimp in the whole quesadilla. It was full of onions. Second thing I got was a chili verde burrito with rice and beans. Again no meat in the burrito only rice and beans and the sauce of the chili verde.  I wish I was able to get a refund because we took it to go and we were unable to take it back. Don’t go here unless you like paying for the opposite of what you ordered.<//review>

< Review>
I went here on recommendation from students at neighboring SDCE continuing education school.

It's a dive place, but the carnitas burrito was large and succulent - packed with moist flavorful pork. Five types of salsa, from mild to spicy, available from the self-serve salsa bar.</Review>

Tacos had salty and overcooked meat with no flavor the sauce to put on them was gone and we were told to do takeout rather than eating there even though it was a half hour before closing. Tortillas were store bought and not prepared in anyway. My friend didn't even eat hers and I only kept eating cause I didn't want to go get something else. We might have caught them at a bad time 30 min before closing regardless having something that is edible is expected. Maybe they have other things on the menu that will be worth it? I wouldn't come for the tacos.< /Text>

Nice portions, but the rice and beans had little to no flavor. The carnita, on the other hand, was crispy and flavorful.< /Review>

5 stars for excellent service, clean location, large portions and good prices.  3 stars for a bland, mediocre California burrito.

The restaurant was clean and well maintained, and the service was fast, friendly and polite.  The prices were good, and the chips and salsa were good quality.  My California burrito was hot and fresh, and it contained a large portion of underseasoned carne asada.  The tortilla was excellent.

I prefer crispy fries on my CA burrito, so I was disappointed that the fries were soft.  Guacamole was included at no extra charge, but it was bland.  There was queso instead of cheese, and it was also bland.</Text>

Fast 5 Pizza has always made delicious pizza. There hasn't been a single time that I have had any reason to complain. I only ordered pizza and bread sticks without ever having any other sides so I can't comment on other items. Pizza however is very good and always hot and fresh. I definitely recommend Fast 5 Pizza.< /review>

<review>I think this had to be my favorite pizza place now. Ordered a large cheese off of DoorDash. Delivery was very fast , pizza was a 10/10, ordered a cheese and ended up getting extra garlic butter on the crust and a lot of Parmesan topped onto the pizza. Was sooo good. Definitely would recommend this place !<//review></record>

Please be aware I just when to buy chicken wings and there was a black guy inside the this place without mask I asked the cashier why they were letting people in without mask and she didn't respond.... this is crazy corona virus is every where and some people just don't care.

Place is great for a quick pepperoni or cheese pizza.  Custom orders require a few minutes wait.
Parking lot is small and there is almost always homeless men hanging out outside asking for money.< /review>

I like the pizza and prices are good but 2 major points 1. Its not that FAST (Never ready takes 10 mins or so to make) 2. Its no longer 5 flat (5.99 1 topping large) so more appropriate name would be Quick 6...it does tatste better than Lil Cesars but not quite Dominos or the Hut</Text>

The pizza gets 5 stars but the service is always bad, if not for the pizza being good I would not go back.
Last visit more than one time the same servier gave extremely bad service it was like she was doing me a favor selling the pizza.
I hope the owner can find someone that likes working there.<//Review>

Generally, it is very good for a quick, hot pizza.  The place does a lot of business, because it is nearly always busy.  I often order the Hawaiian pizza or one topping with bacon.  This time, my pizza may have been cooked too quickly.  It was floppy and a little greasy; not the way it's usually done.  However, I will go back, based on past experience.  Everyone has a bad day every now and then.<//text>

< Review>
Pizza is never  dry. They put plenty of sauce. It's better than little Caesars.  I  did call in an order  once and they gave my pepperoni pizza to the lady  in front of me,  and made me wait 10 minutes more.  I call in all the time and that  has never happened. Hope that is  not a new system.  I know  it was my order because I could see my name on the slip from my stack of  pizza that just stayed under heating lamps while I waited for  my pepperoni  pizza.</Review>

The pizza is pretty good for 5.50 but they never have anything ready or close to being ready. At this location, there are always customers so there is no reason to slow down on making pizzas. It not like they're going to sit. Dont even get me started on the bread sticks. They're good if you can get some. Btw, I usually go at slower times, not during a rush.< /Review>

Great place for a quick bite pizza is well made and allways hot , wings are good too ...only downside is the price of the drinks ...a little over 3 bucks for a 2 ltr....best bet is to get it next door<//Review>

Very rude employees.  Waited 30 mins for a pizza and the people behind me order after me and got their pizza before me.  However I called and spoke to a manager and he said I could have free pizza for the long wait . So today I go for my pizza and this rude employee told me we don't do that here sorry the manager told you the wrong information and there isn't nothing we can do for you.  So you can wait for the manager to talk to you because he's busy but I waited in line just like everyone else.  I won't ever got back there!!!</Review>

<Text>Rude lady so sad how they treat people if you can't do customer service then why work in a place like this. I just asked for the price 2 times & the second time she said it in a bad tone and rudely gave me attitude pizza wasn't even that good. If it's this vs little Cesar's I would say Cesar's, you can never go wrong with it.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Bad service they always take time to give the orders and when you ask for the wings they do not even check if they have the complete order and they make you wait up to 20 min and when they give you the pizzas they are already cold and they just say sorry they do not give a discount or any credit for the next time I do not recommend them

(Original)
Mal servicio siempre se tardan en dar las ordenes y cuando pides las wings ni se fijan si tienen la orden completa y te hacen esperar hasta 20 min y cuando te dan las pizzas ya están frías y nomás dicen sorry no dan ni un descuento ni ningún crédito para la proxima ves no los recomiendo< /Text><user_name>Cesar Alonso10</user_name></record></dataset><record>

< review>
The Oakley store at the Carlsbad outlet is Freaking AWESOME! Jeremy helped me out so much, and was super friendly, and knowledgeable. His salesmanship was fantastic, he welcomed me into the store, asked if I was looking for anything in particular, when I mentioned sunglasses, he showed me where to look for the different styles. He know when to leave me to look at them on my own and when I was ready to purchase  he was close by. He asked if I wanted polarized glasses, and when I answered "yes" he told me the pair I wanted didn't come polarized, but I could custom order them if I wanted, and I did. He was super cool and led me through the custom order process. My new sunglasses will be delivered to my house in the next couple weeks, and I couldn't be happier or more excited. Thank you so much Jeremy and Oakley, I can't wait to get them.< /review>

I bought the sunglasses, around a month ago , went to Store , with my receipt. Talked to the manager, he said I couldn’t do an exchange, the reason he gave me , they were scratched. They were NOT Scratched! And he couldn’t do anything about it . Oakley was my favorite store , Not no more , because of the Idiot manager they have working there .</text>

The service I received at this place was top notch. I was helped every step of the way, with finding the sunglasses for me. 😎 Plus I got a cleaner with unlimited refills to keep them clean.</review>

<text>Today was the biggest disappointment  ever. Got a pair of shades for Xmas and tried to exchange with receipt. The  glasses came with 2 micro scratches that was almost impossible to see it. Manager said that was my problem not theirs and refuse to replace item. Shameful BE AWARE when buying from this store<//text>< name>

Fast service with awesome product and customer service. Got my 2017 F250 all fixed up and totally changed the look. I'll be a return customer. Alot of other shops don't even get back to you or accept messages. Not the case with this shop. Awesome job!!< /review>

Had 2 of my cars taken here for a full ceramic tint job and my girlfriend's truck. Extremely professional and trustworthy. Literally the best prices out of all tint shops. And quality work.</Review>

I got a 99 accord which is nothing special but Dmitriy treated it as if it was, from the phone call to finishing the job Dmitriy was professional, attentive and overall just a good person. I got just what I wanted 👌🏽and the price was good.<//Review>

<Review>If you’re looking for good quality tinting and yet affordable prices this is your place. These guys are very professional and affordable at the same time! Dmitriy was very clear and concise about his explanations and suggestions. He explained the difference between each of the films he installs and helped me choose the film and shades that best fit my needs. Have used this place twice so far and very pleased with the results. Absolutely recommend to anyone!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x809ad89a63fba383:0xba445e15e404ec46</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Came by to replace tint on one window that my kids had damage. Owner-Dimitry was very kind and quick to help. He took my car in right away. As he had a 30 minute window until his next client arrived. I was very pleased. He has a clean waiting area to lounge in. The price was very appropriate. Job was done perfectly. What really makes a business shine is the genuine kind attitude. I deffinatly recommend!< /text>

<Review>Dmitriy is super friendly, got back to me when he missed my call, sat up appointment that worked for my time frame, and when the day came, he had another costumer being late, so he texted me in advance that my appointment could be off by 10 minutes – wow!

He tinted both of my back doors windows super quick and when I came out to check the work, it was fantastic!</Review>< Rate>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>There are many choices for window tint - especially in north Sacramento.  Based on the reviews, I picked Top Line to do the tinting on my new Audi.  His prices are reasonable and his work is top quality.  I used the ceramic tint to help with heat, choosing 50% all around.  I will gladly refer my friends, family and colleges to his shop.< /Text><UserId.>100550477543901117671<//UserId.>< Time>

< Review>
Just one of the best service companies that I have used !!!!    This is the go-to place for many automotive professionals -- dealers and wholesalers alike. They're fast and cheap, but you've got to understand that walk in customers are probably %20 of their business. - Wait times was typically an hour, but i chose mobile service since it was for free. 4 months ago-I highly recommended this place to my coworkers at my company. I had my car window smashed in the middle of the night and they were open right on time at 8am and were able to not only give me a quote but also repair the window. The staff were all very friendly, the prices are way cheaper than most glass shop out there. Today 10/12/13 i was around the shopping center and someone broke into my car again...I called choice glass and they were here for me. i tell you this place is awesome. Again it's Much cheaper than other places around town. The customer service is always fantastic, inexpensive, and very pleasant to work with them.<//Review>

I would highly recommend Topline to anybody.  Friendly, affordable, quality work, and done when it was promised to be done.

<review>Awesome, Fast, Friendly, and best of all Affordable! Dimitriy is an artist when it comes to Tinting. The place I went to before cost about the same but was nowhere near the quality of the tint and finished product that Dimitriy offers. It also came with a lifetime warranty! I will definitely recommend Top Line Tinting to all my friends and family. Thanks!<//review>< date>

This place is a con artist,  very expensive one of the most expensive shops ive talked to, i asked for pricing on my back windows witch are very small and his price was the highest in North Highlands.  It seems the Russians want to screw us. Stay away from this place,  he was almost $80.00 higher than his competition.<//text>

Ordered this to go and took it without checking because I was in a rush and the workers were stacked the day I ordered this. I got home to find out that my sandwich was missing a whole piece of bread. In fact, the whole sandwich seems like it was slapped into the to-go box. The exterior of my box was coated in oils and fingerprints. I normally don’t post reviews but I felt compelled to write this one. I don’t know who the manager is but whoever it is seems to not be doing their job well. The facility is dirty, there are fruit flies everywhere, and the workers in the back, behind the line, seem overworked. I will no longer be purchasing here. it is unethical and lacks decent quality.<//review>

My love for Cafe Mezzo goes way back to my undergrad days (‘99-‘03).  It used to called Cafe Intermezzo but sadly it perished in a fire.  They rebuilt and it’s still just as awesome. This restaurant offers a large variety of very healthy and fresh salads. My favorite is the Veggie Delight.  It comes with a generous portion of fresh sprouts, which is really rare these days.  The poppyseed dressing is the absolute best. A word of warning, the portions are so big, that if you order a full-size salad, you will likely need to share with someone or take part of it home. The salad that you see in my photo is actually a half sized salad. The area has street parking, however it is frequently very busy. I recommend coming on off hours in terms of seating and arriving earlier in the day will offer cleaner tables..</review>

<Text>A Berkeley stalwart for decades. Reliably good sandwiches and salads. The house-made, thick-sliced breads are consistently good. Although the sandwich ingredients aren't top quality, the sum of the parts is very satisfying. The half sandwich with small salad is a great option. Be sure to check the outside patio, and don't let your parking meter expire!</Text>< pictures>

Loved the service and vibe. However, it's kinda messy. Maybe have a garbage can in sight so people are not as sloppy with their mess. The sandwich was delectable, though I wish I could have had my bread toasted. Salad was ok, nothing too special. But I did like the watermelon on top! And the mango green tea was a good recommendation. 4.25 total :)< /text>

Amazing bread and gigantic salad. Tasty kombucha. The Greek goddess and poppy seed dressing are just awesome. The honey wheat bread is spectacular. One of the top salad and sandwich places anywhere. Consider splitting with a friend.</review>

If I were on a deserted Island with only 1 restaurant to go to for the rest of my life, Mezzo would be the one. It is my dream girl of restaurants. Checks all my boxes and makes me feel both good and satisfied.

Our journey began years ago, when I was a young impressionable freshman in Berkeley. Every Wednesday I would get a chef salad after class and eat it for both my lunch and dinner. The portion was big enough that it could sustain even a growing boy like myself for two whole meals. The heartiness provided me comfort through countless disappointing test results, breakups, and failures. And the fact that it was primarily salad meant I didn't gain a single pound for it!

Bur if you're not into salad, their soup and sandwiches are also super yummy. Pretty much anything you get, you can try a sample beforehand. Make sure you take advantage of that if you have a hard time deciding. Regardless of how long the line is, the salaristas will make sure you get something you'll enjoy very much. 10/10. Highly recommended!

Fair warning: If you fall for this place, you may lose some friends. I have gotten more than a few horrified looks when I mention that my favorite restaurant in the whole wide world is a salad spot.< /text>

This is my absolute favorite place in the UC Berkeley campus area. There’s so much good food everywhere but nowhere serves better and healthier salads than this place. For only $13.95, you can get an enormous chefs salad with garbanzo beans, kidney beans, eggs, avocado, a slice of watermelon, a protein of your choice, and a piece of bread! There’s a bit of a line during lunch but it goes by quickly. And you can also sit in the back area with patio-seating, which is super nice.</text>

Love this place. I hadn't been here since it burnt down years ago, and while the inside is completely transformed, the food is just the same and just as delicious. I got the veggie delight with poppy seed dressing. Comes with a whole hard-boiled egg (not overdone) and a half avocado, plus the works of veggies. Dressing was just enough for me; I like dressing kind of heavy and it was a little thick over the lettuce but the other vegetables were undressed so when you mix them it all balances out. Highly recommend!</review>

A really cool, easily accessible, trendy spot in downtown Berkeley with excellent, organic foods!

I've lived in the Bay all my life but this was my first time actually coming to Mezzo. It's a lot of fun - it toes the line of casual but a little nicer too. Not to make a crude comparison, but it goes for a Chipotle vibe, just trendier and more original.

This place has a TON of seating - it was way more spacious than I could have expected with a lot of fun outdoor seating areas and open-air indoor seating too. Very communal type of seating arrangement and it seemed like everyone was having a really good time. Even when it's crowded it's not difficult to find somewhere to sit.

The food here is really quite phenomenal, you can tell it's all naturally sourced and fresh-made when you order. At a little above average price point for a casual meal, this is definitely a place I would stop at again in Berkeley if you have a group that just wants to get some really good salads and sandwiches.</Text>

Good food options, such as complicated toast, breakfast burritos, salads and sandwiches. A bit pricey, but the ingredients are good. Though the black beans are weak.

But this isn’t a place for good coffee! I’ve decided not to get coffee here after a few bad times. The cold brew bubbles and foams and kind of tastes like a stout. And the coffee is generally poor quality.

It’s a big space though, and good seating, and lots of light.<//text>

Huge salads and sandwiches at reasonable prices.  With every gigantic salad,  you get a slice of bread and a piece of pineapple.  I always get the chef's salad with marinated tofu, hold the sprouts.

You can also get soup, half sandwich/salad and now they offer breakfast burritos.

This place is almost exactly like it's former self Intermezzo, but with a few more offerings and now it's credit cards only,  no cash.

The line moves fast, so don't be discouraged if there's a line out the door.<//text>

<text>The best, biggest salad or sandwich you'll get in Berkeley. this is classic veggie faire from way before current day vegans were born. The recipes (yum! poppy seed dressing! Yum homemade croutons! Yum warm homemade whole wheat bread! Yum!Sprouts)! (-: have stayed the same for almost 40 years.It's nostalgic to eat this food, not that the 80's were so great, but coming to eat at  "intermezzo" always was. Its nice to write a rave review.

If you were visiting Berkeley, you need to try out café Mezzo. You can get a great big bowl of delicious leafy greens mixed with your choice of poppyseed to their homemade green goddess dressing. The salad has a delicious mixture of croutons, avocado, cherry tomatoes, beans, an egg and my favorite the sprouts. It’s a beautiful and healthy masterpiece when they prepare it. You always get a side of this hearty piece of bread with your salad and it’s also used for the sandwiches.
If you really love the bread, Mezzo sells bags of bread ends for buck.

Mezzo also provides options of sandwiches as well as soups. One of my favorite things about this place as soon as it’s reopening it brought back a lot of memories for myself as well as my fellow Cal alumni. As an undergrad I still remember Mezzo was a lot smaller in size and and most of us would sit along a railing to eat our salad. It definitely is a great place to reminisce and to enjoy.< /review>

YUM!!! My friend took me to this place when I visited and it was so good! Super cute, casual shop. Super clean interior and spacious. Pretty busy especially at lunchtime but tables clear out relatively quickly. Located in downtown Berkeley so parking is tough, but great for UC Berkeley students! Order then sit down system! There is also a bar connected to Mezzo just next door! My friend told me that bar is also very good. I got the combo deal with the half sandwich and salad. Super reasonable price for what you get. Portions are huge!!! The bread is super fluffy and thick, I love the honey wheat. Menu is straightforward and great for indecisive people like me. The salad was fresh (cherry tomatoes so good) and the herb vignette dressing was delicious!</Text>

Had lunch here with my daughter. Their chicken salad is delicious!!!! This was my 1st time here. Their wheat bread is HUGE!!! You can't get half a sandwich, a whole sandwich was too much for me at one sitting. I'll definitely go back again. Always love trying new places with my daughter.</Review>

Spot on what i expected and wanted from one of Berkeley's landmark restaurants. If you're from around here, you've been here. The bread is thick, soft and satisfying. Salads feels good and bigger than your head. Come and eat. Walk out feeling satisfied in your belly and healthier overall.</review>

<Review>Not really my favorite. Thought it would be better due to the reviews but my tuna sandwich looked and felt like I was eating leftovers. Even the plate was dirty when I received it.

Staff were very friendly, and the place was clean and nice (hence my 2 stars). But the food wasn't good at all, unfortunately.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

HUGE salads! First time my wife couldn't finish it. Seriously shocking. I had a tuna fish sandwich and added bacon. Wow...delicious. Many choices of fresh bread. Great, healthy and communal place to relax and eat. Only wish I took a couple pics.< /text>

<Text>Warning: service here is super variable. If you order the same thing every time, you will undoubtedly get a different sandwich each time (in regards to quantity of ingredients, how the sandwich is put together). People enjoy the big portions here, but when someone skimps on your sandwich ingredients, it doesn't feel like a lot. Sometimes this inconsistency works in your favor, often times not. Overall though, the inconsistency is frustrating. I've ordered a BLTA to-go here and when I got home, I found no avocados... I mean... it's in the name! Generally, the BLTA is pretty good, lots of different components: sprouts, peppers, spicy mayo, crispy thick bacon, good tomatoes, and plenty of avocado slices (if they don't forget them or skimp). Bread is good, in particular I enjoyed the cheese jalapeno roll.

The soup is alright (Thai chicken and rice) but the chicken was a bit tough and chewy. Mint coffee is interesting as well, pretty good. Pastries are alright.

Overall, this place is okay. Service is fairly quick but the line can get horrifically long. At those times, it is definitely not worth the wait, in my opinion.<//Text>< Pictures>

Great breakfast choices.  Highly recommend the breakfast burritos with lots of ingredient choices or the Avocado Toast.  Out of this world.< /review>

Great meal-sized salads and sandwiches in a hip environment with a large outdoor patio. Unfortunately though, they use sugar and canola oil in the dressings and breads. Canola oil is rapeseed marketed to us in a "heart-healthy" disguise. And there are many ways to make a dressing or bread taste good without adding sugar (especially refined sugar). If owners respond with intent to improve, I'll adjust my rating.<//text>

<Text>Mezzo is one of my favorite places to eat in Berkeley. their portions are huge and delicious so i definitely feel like i am getting more than my money's worth. there has been a few times when i have some leftover salad but you can ask for a box to take it home with you. the staff always greet you when you come in and are friendly and nice. plus, they make the salads/sandwiches sooo yummy!! the ingredients that they use are always fresh and clean. the salads are filled with a verity of greens and fruits. there are many seats inside and outside as well (which is a shared place with Raleigh’s Pub). and the bathroom are kept clean for the most part with the sink to wash your hands outside (separate from the toilets so it's more convenient for those who need to just wash their hands).< /Text>< pics>

<text>This is a 1.5mi round-trip from my office that I happily make at least once a week. The salads are proportionally made for giants (not at all a complaint). I usually go with a chef salad/blue cheese/tuna salad and have never been let down by the expediency or consistency of the food.

If you happen to eat at the restaurant, the atmosphere is open, spacious, and inviting. There's great coffee and fresh drink options as well. GT's Kombucha on tap is a plus.< /text>< Pics>

I was a regular in the previous incarnation of Mezzo, back in the 90s, and couldn't get enough of their immense salads and hearty hummus sandwiches. I don't live in the area anymore, but whenever I visit I am drawn to Mezzo. The food is just like I remember it. A half sandwich and green salad could be skimpy in another restaurant, but here at Mezzo you're getting a generously filled sandwich -- you have to try their amazing honey wheat bread -- and not just a typical "side salad" but a full-fledged salad bowl with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, veggies, and croutons. So satisfying!

The old place was a little claustrophobic and known for unfriendly service, but now they have more space and a much nicer staff. They're doing something right! I hope they're around for years to come.< /Review>

<Date>1549042858805< /Date><rating>4< /rating><Review>In general expect a moderate wait for monstrously portioned and pretty decent salads and sandwiches. They are made by a very frazzled staff dealing with a large line that are prone to making mistakes in your order if not carefully watched. Any downsides are redeemed by the exceptional breakfast burrito available till 11 a.m. Soups taste pretty good but are not hearty enough for my taste. Also don't get the PB and banana, it's half a jar of peanut butter with only half a banana.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Want a really good, huge salad? Mezzo is your spot. It's clean, efficient, and the value is off the charts. They aren't organic, but at this price, that's to be expected.

The owner did make this a cash free cafe, so bring a credit or debit card. I also didn't like the suggested tip on the checkout register, but given that this is a college town and there are also a lot of foreign visitors that don't understand tipping in the U.S.A., it's understandable.</text>

A Berkeley institution: affordably feeding students and visitors, alike, for decades (if you include the building that burned down). The rebuild is even better than before but prices are still great.

Very flavorful heaping healthy, salads, soups, and sandwiches. Great vegetarian options. Great kombucha. Lively casual atmosphere.<//Text>

Better than the original with essentially identical menu. I still love it 20 years after my student days. The homemade multigrain bread is great as are all the sandwiches. My favorites are turkey, chicken salad, and peanut butter+banana+honey. Best strategy is the half sandwich and half salad (each of which is sufficient for my lunch). Salads are great too.

All available to go, but the insider experience is to sit on a bench shoulder to shoulder and wolf it down. To go portions usually end up much messier for me...So so good<//Review>

A couple main options to choose from, but I usually go with the half sandwich/half salad with the option to add turkey or ham. The poppy seed dressing is one of a kind along with the honey wheat bread.<//Text>

The line will always be long, but it's entirely worth it. It always has been as far as I can remember. They have a great selection of different sandwiches and salads. Soups are limited, but not why I go there anyway. The sandwiches are made with bread baked fresh daily, right inside. The bread alone is reason enough to stand in line. The salad portion is enough for two meals.</text>

<Review>I've been here before and after the fire.  The food has stayed the same.  My fave is still their chef salad with the poppyseed dressing.  The added bonus is that the bar next door is cool with you eating your salad there.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I cannot go to the Bay without a sandwich and a salad! The portions are huge, but it's great to have the leftovers in the morning! The bread is amazing and the poppy seed dressing can't be beat!< /Text>

A few minutes later the internet was working, so we got our salad. The salad serving was huge and it tasted delicious. We wanted horchata but they didn't have any. We got the mango green tea and it did not taste good. There was also lipstick on the glass.

<Text>Absurdly large salads and sandwiches. My favourite is the half sandwich half salad combo with a BLTA on honey wheat and poppyseed dressing, but honestly you can't go wrong. Everything is super great!< /Text>< rating>

There is often a long line at noon but the line moves pretty quickly so it never takes too long. Their sandwiches are some of the best in Berkeley. They're huge and I highly recommend the BLAT (bacon lettuce avocado tomato). The prices are about what you'd expect for the quality and the cafe has a nice modern aesthetic.<//Review>

Awesome! Huge salad portions, most of my friends could not finish portion because of sheer size. It's very good. But bread and infusion were especially amazing. It's also not rock bottom cheap like some could think looking as single $ sign on Yelp, I spend over $20 for my lunch. But it was well worth it! And there're cheaper options. I can see how it's possible to lunch or breakfast there for around $10

Now I going to look where they buy this bread from...</review>

Huge salad portions and delicious coffee at a reasonable price (for the Berkeley area). Extremely popular with both students and locals bring enormous lines that can take up to 30 minutes to get served during peak hours. Comfortable seating both indoors and out make this a great place to post up to get work done or just to hang out.< /Review>

When I arrived at Mezzo, former Intermezzo (Thank God they reopened it!), it was a bit past 8pm, so I avoided lines and crowds and was able to get a nice seat. I decided to go for Veggie Delight and Chicken Salad and I got it with lots of greens and dressing so I knew I would be stuffed by the time I was even able to finish my portion. The dressing was made of Poppyseed and it was delightfully creamy. The bread was a little dry, but I had an amazing dinner here. Would definitely come back and have something else from the menu!</Text>

Really enjoyed the sandwich. Everything was super fresh, from the meat, to the veggies, and to the bread. The sandwich quality is definitely way better than their soup. New restaurant so it the line was a little chaotic. But I'm sure that'll get worked out once they get into the flow and the employees get comfortable with the menu.< /Text>

Came here as I was told it was vegan friendly. The staff didn't seem to have a solid understanding of what vegan food is, and that caused some slight confusion. In the end there was only one menu item that was actually vegan. The save and grace of this place is their bread. They make it in house and IT IS DELICIOUS. You can also buy loaves from them. Highly recommend trying their bread.< /review>

Like it never burned down! Finally got a chance to visit for the first time since it re-opened and it did not disappoint. I used to love this place and was heart broken when I found out it burned down. The veggie delight tasted as good as it did the last time I had it and the bread....yesssssss!!!  The place looks different obviously but better. Can't wait to go back.<//Text>

*I am open—and hopeful—that I will be able to justifiably modify this review at a later time.

First visit: the service acted like they had better things to do than properly their customers, and non-caffeinated hot drink options were limited to chamomile tea (which makes you sleep). My suggestion that they expand their herbal teas to include anything but chamomile “the sleeper” tea was abruptly brushed aside without so much a second thought by assumably the manager. The tables were visibly dirty—both those that weren’t bused (of which there were multiple) and those that seemingly were. & of course, at the root of all of this, were the heaped (nearly overflowing, in fact) mounds of preserved carcass flesh (aka animal “meat”) being served in their sandwich line. Sowing the seeds of suffering yields—you guessed it—suffering.</text>

Salad barely mixed. Greek yogurt is made with cilantro which completely ruined it for me. They also include a massive chunk of bread. Hard to imagine anyone actually eating that much bread so likely leads to lots of waste.</text>

Good food, but owner should take a supply chain management class. Employees don't seem to operate with any sense of urgency and the output is extremely slow and unoptimized. Eat here only if you are okay waiting for an excessive amount of time.</review>

Great food with big portions. Love how they make a lot of their stuff in house (bread, salad dressings, marinate their tofu, pickle their pickles, etc.) The line may be long but the workers are working their butt off to make sure it moves fast!</review>

- The only flaw is a long waiting line. Avoid peak hours then you will be happy with zero complaint.

This is one of very few restaurants that provides food that is  'delicious' & 'affordable' & 'healthy' at the same time.< /Text>< pics>

Despite being given a togo box covered in various sauces, toppings, and dressings I didn't order, Madison refused to give me a new one saying it would just get dirty from the gloves. She also said the person preparing the food would not be able to put on clean gloves because they're too expensive. So now I have a disgusting food covered box and a bad taste in my mouth from the poor service. I won't be back.</Review>

unnecessarily large portions of fairly plain veggies and bland dressing. I would gladly pay the $9.50 for a salad 1/2 the size with a bit more complexity. Pretty much a giant bowl of iceberg, romaine, cabbage , chickpeas, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers 1/2 an avocado, a hard boiled egg and a whole lot of croutons. How about some beats, radish, peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, arugula,  etc...more variety of veggies less filler. And I still think this portion is encouraging people to over eat even if it is just salad. Plus the place was a mess which is understandable with the huge turn over but still a bit unsettling. It felt like a feed lot. Good idea but needs some fine tuning.< /review>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>1st In 3-4 years very satisfied, Today the person who made my salad barely filled my to go salad to the top.  She had the nerve to take some of the salad out of the bowl.Then  I asked for a side of Chicken Salad and she gave me one small scoop unlike the last time I was there. They filled the small container to the top. In all of my 24+ years they never did that!!! I told her the last time they gave me way more of everything but she refused. They should train them to be more consistent. It took away from the experience because I was woke up think about this salad and invited  a first timer. What happened to making the customer happy for a few more scoops of chicken salad and little more salad like the people in front of me😡😡😡I  don’t know if I will be returning or, never let her make my salad.  I hope management respond to this😡  felling extremely disappointed!!!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80857de1a733e211:0x79ef9933388fbd01< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's now 9.50 for a veggie delight but otherwise the salad is the same size. Recently they've changed the poppuseed dressing for the worse - no longer a fan and can't find a suitable substitute. Vinaigrette is too sweet and the greek-yogurt-green-goddess didn't punch my happy ticket. The bread is still the same. Interestingly you can no longer pay cash. I wonder if it's intentional to keep Street people out. Atmosphere is super casual/relaxed. There's even a little couch area.<//Text>

I love this place..a bit overcrowded at times but makes sense with the influx of people.. Their salad with poppy seed dressing is amazing,and the value for money is good..I hope they consider opening more outlets..<//review>

The old Intermezzo, but larger and brighter.  Same poppyseed dressing, wedge (can't be called a slice) of bread, and yummy but traditional veggies.  It just works.</Text>

Overpriced and not anywhere near the original quality. Staff was mostly impatient and overworked.
Manager fired a friend after she followed directions on reporting an employee sexually harrassing someone. Lawsuit sure to follow. Will definitely not be returning there. Should've been an Indian restaurant. I don't support garbage business practices<//text>

<UserId.>113706585652333742718</UserId.><Text>This was a favorite restaurant years ago b4 the building burned down. I was delighted to find they rebuilt and reopened. They have big salads but not as big as b4. Thier salads, soup, sandwiches and homemade breads are so delicious and satisfying. They still have relatively large portion compared to other restaurants. I detest that since reopening they do not accept cash, only credit or debit cards. What's up with that? I seldom go there but that's only because of thier "no cash" policy.< /Text></record>

Rude cashier whwn I asked for a water glass . the girl tbat made made sandwhich was pissed because I asked for onion and she said were out . i asked her to check the back and she rolled her eyes and asked a guy he laughed and said no. After my sandwhich was made 2 min later they brought out a whole container of onion. Lines are horrible and always a bad experience. Food is good though.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The salads are super big and well garnished !!! I think it's worth it because it's fresh and the concept is cool. On the other hand, prepare to leave with a doggy bag because it takes two meals to finish the salad.
The only problem I see is the waitress .. luckily she was not the only one doing the service but I found her to be detestable .. not even a smile, when asked to repeat she sighs before to do it and clearly it pissed her off to be there ... But besides that I recommend the place :)

Les salades sont supers grandes et bien garnies !!! Je trouve que ça vaut le coup car c'est frais et le concept est sympa. En revanche préparez vous à repartir avec un doggy bag parce qu'il faut bien deux repas pour finir la salade.
Le seul hic que je vois c'est la serveuse.. heureusement qu'elle n'était pas la seule à faire le service mais je l'ai trouvée détestable.. même pas un sourire, lorsqu'on demande de répéter elle soupire avant de le faire et clairement ça la faisait chiée d'être là... Mais bon a part ça je recommande l'endroit :)</text>< Name>
