NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS PLACE!!
I took my son to get a haircut, I showed pictures of what my son wanted to get. I asked them to do a straight hairline and when they were done I took a look and I was shocked that the starlight hairline I asked for was crooked it was diagonal I asked for them to fix it and they made it even worse. If they couldn’t do the straight hairline they should’ve said so I would’ve understood. At that point my son wanted to cry of how horrible the hairline was. They also made me pay in advance, in my opinion I think they shouldn’t do that but instead wait for the finish result. I didn’t ask for my money back because it’s not like asking for my money back would fix the problem.<//Text>

Went in there thinking that it’s be similar to a very good experience to the SuperCuts In my hometown. When I show pictures, the lady was nice to say it looked like a Vietnamese model but as she cut, I kept saying shorter and it seemed it was not as I planned it to be. I got shears instead of clippers on the sides and the top wasn’t textured(it’s a pixie cut). Doing my eyebrows, they weren’t shaped and seemed that they just cleaned them a little bit. They also force you or try to shove product into your hands to buy. I looked at my haircut and was utterly devastated. I spent 30 or so bucks on just my hair cut and I hated it. Sure I could’ve went back in and said fix it, but again-seemed she wouldn’t go as short. So, I went to Ulta instead and the Lady fixed it to what I wanted and shaped my brows to perfection. I will be going there instead of giving Supercuts my service. I feel awkward about getting my money back, even though I really should. Not a great experience.</review>

Its a big name in San Jose but my experience has not been very good. The biggest problem I have faced every time I went for haircuts is the communication gap because the hair stylists over there could not speak proper English neither do they understand. Luckily there was one lady who could. If you are planning to take the free or cheaper haircuts there which they offer to make their students practise then you might want to think twice because there is a big risk involved. If you are going for paid one its costly and you won't feel like giving big tips.< /review>

<text>Walked in with a photo of what I wanted for my son's haircut, thinking there leaves no room for miscommunication. Walked out with something completely different (unwanted) that was too short now to fix and half cut. Told the lady that the picture does not match what I wanted. Still had to pay for the haircut. This was my SECOND time with this experience. I gave a second chance thinking that we all have "off days" and we all need another chance sometimes. Shame on me for giving this second chance.</text>< Gmap_id>

One of the better Supercuts in the area however the place needs a deep cleaning and a furnishing update. The floors are almost black with grime. The stylist draws look unsanitary.<//Review>

<Text>Minh is a sweetheart. She was kind, welcoming and got me seated right away. Cut my hair exactly as I asked, and asked me if things were Ok before she did them. Example: if you part your hair to side, I'll cut it with the part OK. Or, do you want me to clean up the layers? She was very relaxing, I wanted to nap while she was cutting my hair haha. No tugging or breaking. Very satisfied.<//Text><user>103100254836684839311</user>< Rating>

<Review>I just finished getting a hair cut from this place I allways go to Mary but for some reason she was busy . I instead got a hair cut from this other lady I didint even ask for her name because of how mad I was . I had asked her to cut the top to where I can still slick it back I had really long hair . I also asked for a line up but I guess she didint know what that was as she pushed my hairline back instead of shape it .! My hair is now spiky my line up is oval and she pushed my hair line back . Never again will I come to this place I'm never satisfied and this last one really did it for me never again . 30 minute cut that looks like a 5 minute .< /Review>< gmapID>

I may have missed it but I couldn't find a Supercuts along here. First time in CA and needed a haircut for a wedding. I went into a seven dollar place on reccoemedation of the reviews and asked if they were Supercuts and they said "Yes!! Come on in." I asked for a little off the back and sides and she proceeded to start cutting massive chunks of hair off the top. I left the shop and found the real Supercuts on Coleman Avenue 570. Look it up on Google maps. They did a brilliant job of repairing the horrific haircut I recieved here. Honestly I asked to keep the centre parting and she wanted to make me look like the Fonze! Now my 5 inch hair is reduced to a 1 inch hair cut. Bitterly dissapointed.</Text>

This place used to be a favorite. But it has deteriorated on several levels. At first glance it’s easy to see that the place needs a good scrubbing with plenty of soap n water. They blame it on having school kids come by after school. That’s a limited timeframe. And the dirt and grime on the chairs and tables are old. Gum on the chairs. Looks like they haven’t been wiped in a long time.
I changed my order to go. Had taco plate. Hamburger patty chopped up, dry and tasteless. No spices, no taco sauce provided.
Staff was friendly and courteous.<//Review>

Not sure why this is a 4.6 at the time of my visit. This was why I came here. There is no cool air circulation, they have two swamp coolers which made the place humid. The bathroom was unpleasant and they charge a card fee of $1.00 if you spend under $10. Refills are free to small drinks only. The food was okay. Asada Burrito was bland meat with mushy rice. The salsa choices were red or green and brought a lot of heat which I liked. Will not return for that however< /review>

<text>This is a local joint you will want to visit for their burgers and their rice and beans. Place is usually clean. Patrons come in and out so you have a good chance of finding a table. There are a couple of table of twos outside. There is also plenty of parking. For drinks i would recommend a banana milkshake with chocolate syrup or their pink lemonade. Ive been coming here for years, the owner is a sweetheart and her family amd staff are super friendly and remmeber my order. Definitely stop by!< /text>< Pictures>

Work around the corner from this place for two yrs now, maybe had their hamburger special on three different occasions. Decided to try their Brkf GREASE Burrito or (chorizo n egg) as they call it.. Extremely disappointed, how do you screw up chorizo????? Jesus!! The bad tasting salsa they used made it worst. I normally used to get my burritos from Boy's Burgers on Imperial Blvd but we are short handed at work couldn't drive that far.. Ps.... Mr. Pete's chorizo burrito is all hash browns and beans also don't get the burritos there.. 😞 it's not like this places are charging low prices for their so call food. I really need to start cooking at hm.. Can't buy good food now ah days... God Bless.. 🙏<//Text>

Always great food and excellent prices. I love the asada burrito, it's very filling and has a good amount of meat in it.< /Text>

<text>They have delicious burgers and I like that they have a lot of choices for drinks. My favorite drinks are the cucumber lime water and the champurrado. The champurrado is usually only during the winter season though. The prices are a little steep but nowadays everything is expensive.</text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Very rich food, excellent prices and perfect quantity, super friendly and respectful employees. My only complaint is that they need more people for delivery, because I have already requested delivery 2 times and in the 2 they have been bad in one they did not give me Imcomplete and in another I take an hour when I called that the delivery person had just arrived and that If I still wanted my food to be made. Of course I told him to cancel it. But of course I don't blame the employees we are human and we have mistakes. But for the next pongance more abused.

(Original)
Comida muy rica exelentes precios y cantidad perfecta, empleados super amables y respetuosos. Mi unica  queja es que necesitan mas personaas para delivery, Porque ya pedi delivery 2 veces y en las 2 me han quedado mal en una no me entregaron Imcompleto y en otra tomo  una hora cuando me llamarom que la personaa del delivery acababa de llegar y que si yo todavia queria mi comida para que me la hicieran . Por supuesto le dije que lo cancelara. Pero  porsupuesto no le echo la culpa a los empleados somos humanos y tenemos errores. Pero para la proxima pongance mas abusados.</Review>

Everything was made fresh. Tasted authentic and the service was great. We called ahead to make sure they could seat our large party because they are a small space and they made room for us.< /Review>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>Service was friendly and fast. Value was good. There was a bit of confusion about whether things were gluten-free. Fortunately most people don't have to worry about that. One of the employees may have been new as there was confusion with the register.

It's clear that there already are regulars as some customers were greeted by name and one of the employees knew what they ordered.

All of our tacos were very good as where the beans. I thought the rice was a little soft; the flavor was very good. The agua fresco was delicious.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyxMwGTyy_eeFXxzTq3RzQ6c8jHwaHVP9GJC-f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dd31a3361dfdfd:0xc4a17af2bf12e880<//gmap_id></record>

This hole in the wall gem is a must visit for good, delicious, authentic mexican food. Its located behind a mexican grocery store but shares the same flavors as a 4 star resturant.

They have there chancla special, which consist of house made corn tortillas that are grilled on cheese on the flat top. After that you pick your meat and pour your hot sauce on and pray for a second stomach</Review>

I loved the food!  The mole taco and birria taco were my favorite out of everything we tried.   The beans and rice were perfect.   Unfortunately our flan didn't make it in the bag to rate it.   We'll still definitely be back.   It was yummy!< /review>

Wanted to grab a quick bite at lunchtime. Two tables outside occupied at lunch. When it looked like it would be my turn, three other parties cane in with to go orders. It was nice that they made these orders out front when the clients arrived, but they should have moved someone from the back of the house to take care of those in line. Anyway, after about ten to twelve minuted of this, i just left. Will maybe return some other time if it appears service has improved.< /Text>

<Review>Fantastic food... I ordered their taco combo. It comes with 3 tacos beans and rice combo... I had a chili verde, carne asada and chicharon taco. The meats we're all well seasoned and the homemade tortillas we're superb!!!

Great tasting tacos guisados. Reasonably priced and for the serving size and taste it is well worth it. I couldn't make up my mind so I tried 4 different ones. The lengua was perfectly cooked. The birria had authentic taste. The tinga had just the right amount of chipotle. The carnitas were fresh and flavorful.<//Text>

BUT decided to give it a try since I read they have hand made tortillas. Mmm!
This place is literally a whole in the wall. I am so glad I found it!  We got taco plates and more tacos and WOW! Delicious! There's a variety of meats and they have Mole! The service was wonderful made us feel like we were walking in into a friends house!. You need to try it for yourself.<//Text><rating>5<//rating>< response>

I had ordered 2 burritos with birria on August 11th. I would not say it is the best I have ever had, but it was decent. The pricing is okay. However, the beans in the burrito were bland, the rice needed a bit more flavoring, and the birria was dry but well seasoned.< /review>

I went in with my friends. Everyone ordered something different and really liked it. They’re really picky with their Mexican food too! I ordered a burrito and it was big, the asada was delicious and the salsas were delicious!
I also tried la agua de pepino which tasted so refreshing!
Will definitely be back!<//text>

The handmade tortillas were just right (not too thick not too thin). Collectively we had tacos de asada, chicharron, birria, tinga de pollo, carnitas with salsa verde and molé! oh man, the flavor each one of these packed was amazing! Can't forget the cucumber water (Agua de pepino) The customer service was great, especially Ish. Very charismatic and welcoming!

(Translated by Google) Mexican food made with love. I loved the quesadilla. They have coffee custard! (I do it but never saw it in a restaurant). The service is charming and very attentive. It has a few tables outside that are mostly shaded. The price is modest, portions generous, and there is plenty of parking around. Sometimes the owner is present and cares about you, and that is priceless.

(Original)
Comida mexicana hecha con cariño. Me encantó la quesadilla. Tienen flan de café! (yo lo hago pero nunca lo vi en un restaurante). El servicio es encantador y muy atento. Tiene unas pocas mesas afuera que mayormente tiene sombra. El precio es módico, porciones generosas, y hay mucho aparcamiento alrededor. En ocasiones el dueño está presente y se preocupa por ti, y eso no tiene precio.< /Review>

I had an overall bad experience going to the Western Dental and Orthodontics off of Main Street in Corona, CA. The lady in the front (I think her name is Brenda) who handles the finances and insurance was very condescending, unhelpful, and inappropriate. I wanted to visit a dental office because I’m having dental problems right now, so I wanted to be seen right away. The lady told me I couldn’t be seen because my insurance was having issues. When I had called to schedule the appointment the woman I spoke to ran my insurance and said I was covered by my insurance. The lady Brenda had a very rude tone and seemed like she hated her job. I wanted to cry by the way she was explaining stuff to me. I ended up having to pay out of pocket for an awful experience. $136 for them to take x rays.. I didn’t receive a teeth cleaning like I was supposed to. The lady who took my x ray’s was very nice and helpful. But after when I talked to the lady Brenda who handles the finances and insurance she was very unhelpful and condescending once again. She spoke in Spanish to her coworker thinking I wouldn’t I understand, saying negative stuff about the way the lady filled out the chart that says all the work that needs to be done on me. (This was right in front of me) I thought this was unprofessional in front of a patient. Not only that but the nice lady who helped me asked Brenda if she can do something and she responds “I can’t do that. Let me do my job, and you do yours.” The way she said this was so rude. I felt awful for the nice lady who helped me. I don’t understand how someone like this works in the health industry knowing how sensitive patients are. I will not be returning to this dental office.<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I took my mom in for some dental procedures. The dentist was rude from the beginning and very rushed. We have been waiting for approval from her insurance for three different procedures. The dentist office called 4 times on one procedure and each time we said we wanted to wait for the other procedures to be approved before proceeding since it involved pulling teeth. After not hearing from them for almost two months, I called back asking for an update on what has been approved only to find out that they did not even submit one of the procedures because "it will not be covered". I explained to lady I was talking to that the dentist specifically said he had to take certain x-rays to make sure it would be covered and she repeated that it would not so they will not submit it. She also said the other procedure was not covered. She asked me what dentist we saw and I told her I did not remember his name and asked her if she should have a record of it from my mom's visit. This office is unorganized and rude. I will say that when we visited, the lady who checked us in was nice and friendly but she was the only one. If you are looking for good dental office, I would avoid this one.</review>< Pictures>

Incredibly rude and disrespectful staff,just trash service all around. Never again with this horrible place. How dare you get mad I won’t let you charge me a few grand out of pocket when we have insurance that fully covered everything. Sorry you didn’t get your sale? Sorry you couldn’t railroad us into debt? Just a terrible experience all around.</Text>

I took off work early my appointment was at 4 o’clock it’s now 520 and I’m walking out. Very insensitive people. They seem way too eager to finance the dental work my insurance didn’t cover before insurance even approve the procedures.What a waste of time.<//text>

I get surprised by the time managing and profesional attendance that I received at this location.
Is obviously that Cathy Diller us running the place with total professionalism that it reflects on the staff
I recommended, easy to set up appointments, easy to qualify for financial aid.</text>

<time>1602834305838<//time><rating>1<//rating><text>Update...a couple of months after I paid my contract off they decided to charge me $200 to close out my account! I was told they charged me for some work done (which is untrue.. they told me they wouldn't do anything else unless I started a new contract) then they said it was charged to close my account!! What?!! I didn't even know of the charge until corporate called me to collect a debt!!! So on my credit report it went and I didn't even know they charged me.  And for what?! I paid my contract. Why am I being charged more money? They are so greedy I am in shock.  And corporate won't do anything but collect.  I have to go to this particular office to settle it.  I was told my a few people to call the state health care management or something and start an investigation.  I really believe they are at least double dipping, charging me and then the state... maybe even triple dipping charging me twice and then the state also.  I'm done dealing with western dental.  On to getting them investigated!!

Never again will I go to this greedy place that won't do the work the contract states!! I would give zero stars if it were possible! I can't believe the wait time with an apoointment only to be told I need to make another appointment because they can't do what needs to be done</text>< pics>

< review>
I went today for my daughters braces consultation upon arriving Brenda the receptionist was not at her desk to receive patients, there were two other associates there neither of them helped me either Brenda finally made her way to her seat and instead of greeting me she just plainly said ortho or general? I didn’t even know she was speaking to me as she didn’t even have eye contact with me, I answered and said ortho she then again in a plain short temper voice said that line is over there, once we checked in with her male associate he said just wait to be called we then proceeded to sit in the waiting area in the lobby she(Brenda) then just said to me if you’re waiting to be called for an appointment you have to wait outside again With an attitude. She was never polite from the beginning or the end. Horrible customer service. Sadly will be going to another dental office.<//review>

The dentists and assistants I've seen have gone out of their way to help me, which is not something I would expect these days. Shiva was an especially kind, and caring woman who helped me with my anxiety. I'll be coming here for more future dental work for sure, not that I want to have more dental work or anything...</review>< Pictures>

<text>Seen by Dr Chen Benson.  Loves what he does for his patients. Cares to do the best for their teeth, like he did mine. Fixed my implant and went far and beyond to remove some plaque that had accumulated on my other salvaged teeth and my denture!  Highly recommended. Thanks Dr. Benson</text>< Resp>

If you love to waste your time, visit this dental office. I was a new patient and made an appointment for a Tuesday (my day off). I arrived early to fill out new patient paperwork. Upon arrival to check-in, they told me that I was scheduled for Thursday.

I let this minor issue slide and made a new appointment for the following Monday at 9:00AM. Again, I arrived early at 8:55AM. The staff told me they had just arrived and would be powering on the computers to check me in.

At 9:01AM a staff member came outside and told me that they were having a meeting and my appointment was going to be at 9:30AM.

I have NEVER witnessed a business act like this. They did not apologize nor did they say anything else. It almost felt like I was a burden to even be there in the first place. I made my choice to go here based on reviews. Obviously the reviews are extremely inaccurate. I will not be returning to this business and I strongly advise you do the same. Unless you love to be treated wrong and waste your time.< /text>

Awesome team! Sometimes the wait is horrible, even with appointment. But the team makes up for it! Brianna always remembers me and my family and greets us with a smile. The children's dentist here is great also! She knows her stuff and make sure the kids trust her before working on them, making it easier for the procedures. Brandon is a great hygienist btw! Also, the orthodontist is fantastic as well!!<//Review>

I had the best visit at the Corona location.  I had not been to the dentist for years and I knew that I had a very serious need to go. I was so anxious.  My dentist was amazing Janet and Stephanie were great and helped me so much and Kathryn my new dental hygienist....just set me at ease and I can already feel the difference. My teeth feel so clean. I have more to do and I'm excited to get this done.  Trust me go see them and you will not be disappointed. I wish I had gone to them sooner.</text>

It was a calm atmosphere. Front office was friendly and greeted me as I walked in through the door. Filled paperwork out and was called within 5 minutes. I guess morning time is the best time to come in. Brandon took my X-rays and was very kind. Afterwards, Dr. Benson did my exam and explained what needed to get done, which was a basic cleaning. He was very professional. The business manager Cathy was very welcoming and friendly. She told me what my insurance covered. Luckily, I take tremendously good care of my oral hygiene. My insurance covered everything. I got my cleaning done and I must say, they did a pretty darn good job. I would definitely recommend this dental office to everyone I know.<//Review><userid>104770418326220585856< /userid><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

They will ask you every 5 seconds if you need this or that. The worst part was when youre in the middle getting your teeth clean they make you sign stuff. Are you kidding me?

<user_id>107140885957253588632< /user_id><rating>1</rating><text>The only reason I am leaving 1 star is because I couldn’t leave 0! Horrible office. My daughter and I both went there and had general dental work and braces placed. My daughter had all 4 wisdom teeth removed and I was quoted an insanely high amount of money as my out of pocket cost. I paid it and then after the procedure I received my explanation of benefits and I paid almost double what I was required to pay. This was 4 months ago and they refuse to refund me. Calling customer service is a joke as they won’t talk to you unless you are listed as the responsible party. Her dad is listed even though I am the subscriber of the insurance which makes no sense. The office manager Cathy just tells you she is working on it and never gets anywhere. I am owed money and have already contacted the dental board and the better business bureau. Since my braces are paid in full I am kind of stuck staying here but they will no longer have my family for any general dental needs. Avoid this place unless you want to pay way too much and never get money back you are entitled to!<//text><Name>Just Me</Name>< time>

< review>
Walked in with a dental EMERGENCY.. my face was extremely swollen, I was in pain and I felt like all they tried to do from the start was try to sell me things that weren’t related to the situation I came in for. I got refereed to a specialist which also couldn’t help, their 1-800 numbers are ridiculously unprofessional I constantly got hung up on and transferred for no reason. Im glad I made the decision to drive to another dentist at Hospitality Dental to find out I had an infection that was spreading which apparently is no joke! And he immediately took action and helped me out due to the swelling on my face being so bad it was working it’s way to my eye..

But my experience with Western Dental was horrible and I have completely lost trust in them all together..    They’re just there to try to sell you on everything that they can; I don’t think they actually care for their patients health.. that’s just my opinion based on my experience.< /review>

I amaze that how I found my way back to Western Dental here in Corona, now, I not one who enjoy going to the dentist. My first impression was how clean, well staff the office is and how welcoming everyone was. The manager Cathy Diller was great easing my nerves on making decision for treatment and financing with Sylvia, Brenda the other staff.
Now, Dr. Benson Chen manage this professional dental staff so well so I will thank Brandon, Janet, Crystal and Dr. Hoang Nguyen for their comfort and support during my treatment. I have to point out that all the Doctors in this office all have the right stuff individually to treat by themselves but they all coordinate perfectly for the benefit of all the patients.
Keep up the great work!!! Hector Vargas</Text>

I didn't know Medi-Cal provided dental benefits for adults. I went here because it was close to home, and a highly reputable dental company. I have been coming here since 2014. Very professional and attentive staff. I recommended my friend here, and now she goes there too. A+++ if you are looking for a dentist, go here.<//text>

Doc. Benson DDS had the pleasure of giving me my 1st Western Dental experience. After i heard the "good", the" bad", and the straight up scary stories of W. D.  office's that occupy the Downey, Long Beach, and L.A. offices the past 20 years,I was Apprehensive! But, that is NOT the case here in Corona! I had a comfortable experience, AND YOU WILL TOO!</text>

The reason why this is three is because of the orthodontist... Dentistry is HORRIBLE in preparation to my braces i had my wisdom teeth extracted. They tried to pressure me to put me asleep and when i refused they got mad!! Then the dentist then did not even wait for the local anesthetic to work on my gums and cut them without any numbness.. I FELT EVERYTHING!!!! i was crying and he wouldn't stop! HORRIBLE service !! Then they proceeded to entangle me to buy some mock bone thing for my wounds that would help my teeth as i am older!!?? Super expensive as well.. still in debt..<//review>

Definently avoid this place.

I had a visit recently and was pressured into signing up for a contract to get my wisdom teeth removed.  They quoted me an insane amount and claimed my insurance wouldn't cover the cost of General Anesthesia. They started charging me for the procedure even though it hasn't been done and when I contacted my insurance, the lady who answered my phone call said that the GA is covered and I shouldn't have to pay out of poket because it's medically necessary. Now reaching their customer service is a complete joke. Have made 23 calls trying to get a simple breakdown of my bill and have them send a request to my insurance for the GA but instead I have been bounced around from one number to another and they refuse to answer my question about a breakdown of my bill. Save yourself some time and take your business else where.<//review>

<Text>DO NOT TRUST CATHY DILLER!
SHES A SCAM ARTIST.
SHE ONLY WANTS YOUR MONEY & WILL NOT FINISH THE WORK CHARGED!

This western Dental screens their phones calls and sends you directly to hold without even saying a word once they find out your want a refund.

Just a warning that this dentist is a scam and only want you money!
Trust me I'm in pain from the unfinished root canal that i was fully charged for.

THEY CHARGE TRIPLE THE AMOUNT FOR A CROWN THAT YOU COULD GET CHEAPER ELSE WEAR.....

DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<GmapID>0x80dcc83ce35847ed:0x8ccac71c721fc33d<//GmapID><text>Dr. H and Crystal are amazing! Dentists give me so much anxiety. The noise, the smell, the hurry that they are in to get you in, out, and done. I hated going to the dentist. This year I have been seen by Dr.H and Crystal 4 times (cleaning, cavity, root canal, and crown prep with temp crown placement). Normally I am very tense in the dental chair. With the two of them, I was so relaxed during my appointment that my fitbit thought I was taking a nap!! They laugh and joke, everytime they walk over I can over hear the conversation and it makes me laugh. They share personal stories and talk to me like a friend. I dont feel like a patient or a chart number. They are quick and efficient, but also make me take breaks so my mouth doesn't get too sore. I have never ever enjoyed going to the dentist, but now instead of being afraid/nervous, I am relaxed. Thanks Dr. H and Crystal, you two are amazing!< /text>< Date>

I could tell even from check-in: the office is focused on making as much money as possible. Their price quote for services was outrageous, and of course wasn’t covered by my insurance, even though I have Medi-Cal and a yearly cleaning and many other services are covered 100%. I walked out without getting any services done. Sometimes if you’re too money-hungry, you lose customers. This is what happened.<//review><Date>1511553024283</Date>< pics>

Horrible !!!nightmare ! Went here got work done and my mouth has been severe pain every since . Went back 4 times and no relief. Got 3 other 2ND opinions and every filling they did has to be redone.also my bite is so uneven my splint doesn't fit anymore information they didn't disclose before they started working on me.  I called them and let them know their faulty work and I felt I shouldn't have to pay with all the pain I need to go through to fix what they did and they still sent me to collections without even calling or sending a notification.  Do not go here they are crooked and obviously don't know what they are doing . I have 11 fillings that need to redoneat. Avoid them and the pain and suffering they cause .OH AND CALLING THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LIKE IS POINTLESS THEY DON'T ANSWER AND SEND YOU IN CIRCLES.

Do not go here 11 fillings I need redone and they sent me to collections because I won't pay them a dime because of their faulty work.  Best part is they gave me derogatory remarks without even calling me or notifying me. BEWARE< /review>

<Review>The children's dentist discriminated my son for having autism even though he was being compliant the whole time..we waited over an hour in the dentist chair waiting on her and yet he was calm and didn't have any behaviors..my daughter on the other hand had lots of behaviors and she said i'll do ehat i can and she was going to attend my daughter..they made me sign the paper where it said that she had gotten a crown even though i told her she wasn't getting the crown..when i left the children's doctor went after me all the way outside yelling don't you want the referral to loma linda...i hate this place ..my son had gotten a cleaning here before and they didn't have a problem with him at all...she also put his handds on him telling him she was going to give him a toy...nobody should touch a child or anybody there is no reason to put your hands on a child...and she kissed a patient on the cheeck it was a little boy and his father was carrying him...since when do dentist kiss kids on the cheeck for being good customers ...< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Went here with broken filling on front tooth told them i wanted root canal and crown which is very reasonable with my insurance. The dentist told me it couldnt be done that i needed an implant so i decided to get second opinion at riverside western dental the day of my appointment there the dentist called me and said she spoke to cirona dentist and she agreed the only option was an implant and i didnt need to come see her. The implant by the way is 5000$ all out of pocket, so i went to two dentists that do implants didnt tell them anything about western and bith gave me estimates for root canal and crown nether one even mentioned an implant so western is telling you the most exoensive option is the only option and i intend to report them to the ADA</Text>< Pics>

the absolute worse dental experience ever!!!!!!!
So I went in for a cleaning and a check up and it was determined that I needed two fillings and a crown (I chipped my tooth a little while ago).  The dentist (male Dentist by the name of Tran I believe) was horrible.  When I was discussing my dental anxieties he was extremely short and snippy and said I will just refer you then and you could tell he did not want to be bothered by any of my questions.  Prior to that he argued with me as to what my insurance covered.  I knew that they covered a temporary crown and not a permanent crown and he said no that they did not cover either.  He then did not want to be bothered by me and passed me to the dental hygienist to explain that it would not be covered but I could pay $1,064 for a permanent.  I told them that that was not an option at the moment.  She insisted that that was my only option. So I went home and called my insurance which again told me a temp crown was covered.  I called western dental back and they said that I was wrong and they did not know who I spoke to but that was incorrect.  I insisted that they call my insurance for clarification.  They did and found out I was correct so I made an appointment to have the work done.  When I got there I waited over an hour to be told that they did not have time to do the crown but could do the two fillings----the teeth that need the fillings are not the ones in pain.  So I said this is ridiculous that you refuse to do all the work needed.  Tran insisted that they did not have anytime to do it and that I could reschedule to have the crown done.  I had been there for about an hour and a half at this time.I told him that I was here now for the work to be done and because he has "no time" is unacceptable!  He then told me that my appointment was only for 2 fillings which was untrue!  To say the least an argument ensued.  I was so angry I left the office all together!  Tran has no manners whatsoever he has no social skills at all!  He should be terminated because he is a representative of this company and he is horrible!  Furthermore, the bathroom did not have any toilet seat covers and there were nasty used rags piled up all over the bathroom.  The overall cleanliness of this establishment was awful!!!!  DO NOT GO TO THIS OFFICE!!!!!  (on the up side the lady who did my 4 yr olds teeth was wonderful-patient and kind and the room was clean)< /Text>

Bad customer service  at front desk, and bad patient care inside the dental work area.  Since the 1st day i noticed that they don't care about their patients except the money!. The stuffs don't really know their scope very well, makes me very uncomfortable to let them work on my teeth. They tried to charge me more besides my insurance share, i went to different dentist and guess what. .. been told my insurance covers it all. Very unprofessional all over their services,  making appointment is horrible. ...., i don't recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

Very rude staff and charged me for services that were never done. I filed a complaint and of course they say services were done but my daughter walked in to get braces and walked out with nothing but yet I'm still being charged for braces. Worst dentist office I have ever been to and a bunch of lying scam artist.< /Review>

This office is full of LIES! and ripoffs. i'm too mad to even talk right now. brb.

okay.....so first off, the primary doctor should replace the verizon guy, as he just walks around on his cell phone like he is searching for a signal in a building with tons of equipment interference.
They also refuse to use the complete scope of medi-cal benefits available to patients. there is a new change to Medi-cal which allows a patient to pay a $25 co-pay for the 'consultation'  and recieve the services for free. They could for example: accept 25 dollars to perform a deep cleaning on one quadrant, which until a few months prior to now was 100 dollars in both this office and my official dentist's.
So, why the $125 per quad deep cleaning advertised price,
hey western dental?
They broke my tooth next to the one they performed extraction, and now i believe they should make available to me the 400 dollar bone graft for the 25 consultation fee which Medi-cal is now offering to qualifying individuals, which I am one of these so lucky enough.    we are being evacuated for fires now. bye bye.< /Review>

<review>When I made an appt for myself and two kids to get checkups and emergency service for a broken tooth for me I was pleased to get in same day. When I made the appointments, the customer serv rep asked if I would also like to make ortho appts to determine if my kids and I needed braces and if they would be covered by my insurance. So the day of the ortho appts before I had even seen the ortho, a lady began pressuring me into a contract to get braces, mind you I had no idea if I needed them at that point! I kept telling her I wasn't sure, that my finances are extremely tight as a single parent that I would like to see first. She wouldn't let up, she kept pressuring and pressuring. Finally the ortho sees me and says yes I need braces. The lady comes back in and starts pressuring me again, insisting that I have to do this. She brings some papers in and tells me that she'll do all three of us for $99 per month. I sign something as I figure $99 for all three of us is actually pretty good. Then she comes back in and asks me for my debit card and if I'm excited about getting my braces on that day. I question getting them that day since I have an appt for the next week to have two extractions and the ortho had stated I would need a deep cleaning first. She goes out and comes back and says nope its all good, you're getting them today. I reconfirm that it will be $99 per  month for ALL THREE of us, and she says nooooo $99 per month for each of us, so basically $300 a month for all three, plus the $70 per month I had already setup for the additional cleaning irrigation they said both my kids needed. I told her no, I can NOT afford that much, that I thought she had said $99 per month for all three of us for braces. I told her I don't want the braces right now, I can't do it, I need to go home and think about it and figure out what I can or can not afford. She continues to pressure me hard, to the point that I'm almost in tears. She finally says fine, I'll cancel everything, but if you get a hold of me next week I'll give you the same deal. A couple days later I have to take my daughter back in because a filling they did the previous week is causing her severe pain, turns out they didn't file it correctly. This lady begins pressuring me again, I tell her no not right now and leave. Well a month later, and guess what....I'm getting a bill for $99!!!!!!! For braces I NEVER GOT!!!! Needless to say, I am livid and will be filing grievances with any and all that I can and if need be will be taking this to court! Save yourself the headache and stress DO NOT GO HERE! If you like the used car salesman mentality then go ahead, but if you're a struggling single parent like me or someone who just needs good dental care....run far away from this place!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< Review>
MOST FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE OF MY YEAR!
Showed up 30 mins before appointment. 4 patients who got there after me all went in and came out by the time my name was called 1 hour and 50 minutes later.
X-rays rushed and clumsy, got hurt by both the probe in my mouth and the dangling machine that kept moving after nurse walked out to shoot the gamma rays.
Waited for doctor on the dentist chair 45 more minutes.
Doctor came super rushed checked my mouch for less than a minute and left. Didn't alow me to ask questions.
Then I was forced to sign a paper that service was good<//Review>

THIS WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! Went in for my wife in 11/2012 for a bad toothache. We also have one of the best dental insurance around(insurance covers 98% of cost). Ok the day we went in we waited like 15 mins until they called my wife in. They xray tech took her to take some xrays. Just about to start getting her xrays started. Another employee stopped the procedure to have a child get their xrays done first. The whole time my wife witnessed the employees use the same latex gloves that was used for my wife on this child. When it was my wifes turn again the employee was going to use the same gloves. My wife made them change the the pair of gloves to a new pair. After the xrays were finished they took my wife to the dental chair. My wife made them bring me in to the back office to be with her. As we waited for the dentist. I was watching all the employees including the dentist(some vietnamese girl with terrible english) after my wife told me about the glove usage here. Finally when the dentist came over to check out my wifes teeth. At this point the dentist said my wife needed to se a surgeon for the tooth to be pulled and that it has to be done somewhere else(they have no one at this office to pull teeth, weird huh). Now here it goes. The dentist then told us that my wife needed to receive 15 antibiotic injections into her gums. This is $50 each and that my insurance is pating the other part. The dentist also ended up saying she needed more work. Our price out of pocket with insurance was $1200. This fat mexican girl would do the pricing. When we walked into the office I had my insurance pricing chart and codes(what they pay and our co-pay). So I knew everything ahead of time. Ok back to this fat girl. She told me that they do not have the pricing for my dental insurance and if she can barrow it to get the pricing. All of my copay's and insurance pay chart was totally differant from the estimate Western Dental gave us. Now the dentist insisted that my wife receive all the work now and that that the work need was worth $3000 and we would get a deal for $1200. I told them why do you think I pay alot for the best dental insurance. It's to pay less out of pocket and that you people are crazy. I also told the dentist( I made a scene) why in the hell does this office have such dirty floors and that there is hair all over floor. Why doesn't your employees change their gloves after every patient. We left and went home. At home I wrote a letter of complaint to the Western Dental Corp office and made a call also. Next day my wife woke up with sores in her mouth and she had to go on antibiotics for a week. So with sore in the mouth it shows that the Corona office is working in unsanitary conditions. I bet you that asian dentist was using the same gloves on every patient. Later 3 weeks later we went to SmileCare in Riverside to get the dental work done. This office is the cleanest I've seen yet. Also every employee had a greating attitude. Main thing was that I only paid SmileCare $35 for my wife dental work. It was a wisdom tooth and another molar tooth that needed to be pulled out. The teeth pulled only took 5 minutes. Next day my wife isn't in pain and with no infection like the one she got from Western Dental in Corona. DO NOT GO TO THRE WESTERN DENTAL OFFICE OF CORONA,CA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//review>

(Translated by Google) I have a year and 6 months that I had the 4 extractions and I do not see much difference. On many occasions I have to fix the wire because they don't put it right. And because they do not have time to attend to me, when I have already casted more than 6000 dollars for a job that would do better elsewhere. I give 2 stars and it is very much my partner
I have 1 year and 6 months that I had the extractions and I do not see much difference. On many occasions I have to fix the wire myself because they cannot attend to me. When I have already paid over $ 6,000 for their work I think another place would do better. I give 2 stars and I think it is a lot of my opinion

I recommend not coming here, three of my fingers were cut badly while filing. I asked for regular polish, but painted my nails with gel polish. i didn’t know during the process. When it came to pay they told me i had to pay for gel because they used it and “ gel looks nicer”, but i told her that if it’s their mistake, i shouldn’t have to pay for that much more, when i clearly said i didn’t want gel because i didn’t have the money then.< /Text>

< Review>
They are good at putting nails on but taking them off is a different story.  Instead of taking the nails off in a safe manner that wouldn't damage my own nails, she took a new nail, slid it under the old nail and just ripped them off taking several layers of my own nail with it.  It hurt to say the least, not to mention it ruined my own nails.  There was fungus growing under two of my nails that I had to go to a doctor to treat effectively.  Their prices might be cheaper but in the long run it will cost you more.  I will never go back to this salon.  Save yourself all the b.s. and pain by going somewhere more professional.</Review>

They did a good job on my nails, but as for friendly, not so much.  They were at best, cordial. The technician addressed me with a series of hand movements and grunts. No actual words until telling me the price.<//review>

I have visited this place a few times and they were ok. I rarely had a long wait. The manicure and pedicures were always good. Loved getting my pedi here because the foot massage was great and so relaxing. The thing I disliked about this place was that they don’t like to turn people away so people end up waiting sometimes or they do a rush job on you. Like when I needed my eyebrows done. They completely gave me a line on my eyebrows as if it was shave off but not on purpose. They could have just admit that they made a mistake but instead they talk about you in their native language, very unprofessional and rude. I do not recommend this place if you do not have an appointment!</review>

If I could give this place no stars I would....

Every time I went in there to get my eyebrows done they would act like I'm asking for charity and made me wait an hour for it....

I Have called for an estimated and she just hang up in my face....

When I do get my eyebrows done they always different... they don't know how to do eyebrows...

My nails are always something wrong with them....

Horrible experiences ever</Review>

I often thought about patronizing this nail spa and I did today. It was well worth the price. I received a foot massage with hot rocks and a mini back massage.  I was truly pampered. Thanks!</review>

The worst I’ve ever had. I’ve been trying new places and am sorry after this.  One nail is crooked. I tried telling her and she says “I know I know I know” but never fixed it. The polish was too thick and uneven in places so my nails look THICK. Three of ten look ok. Never ever again!< /Text>

Mia is remarkable!  Always love my gel manicure and pretty pedi as well as the great friendly service that Mia provides.  Lavish Nails at Kapolei is convenient with lots of parking for low stress mani pedi's anyday of the week.  Everything is clean and sanitized with your own free personal file kit given to you at the end of your nail service.  This is a nice touch!< /Text>

<name>Marissa Diaz<//name><review>The worst nail place ever! I went there to get my nails done for my sisters weeding.first the nail lady clipped my toe and cut me, then I got a severe infected toe from unclean tools. It started to swell that day I got them done.  It hurt so bad that I had to go to the hospital. I left with another brides maid then left my keys and went back inside to grab them and then I seen a freaking mouse in the shop! Never go! It might be cheap but not worth it. Because your hospital bill will come out more than getting your nails done at a way nicer place....</review><GmapID>0x808e31f28b702d31:0x3f534a71ca288661<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I do not understand why some people on here say bad about the school. I have had a great time here in the school studying my university in Marketing. My professors were very knowledgeable and the staff in the office has always helped me. I will indicate this school to many friends.<//Text>

<review>Fake university. There is NO student services and they don't support the students. They don't care about the students.  Be careful with the administrative staff. They are unprofessional and their fail will affect you. Don't trust or count on them. Get everything written/email and double check it.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<date>1601666484196<//date><Review>The attitude of the front desk is very, very poor. She will be angry and will shout loudly to hang up the phone and so on. I wanted to transfer to school around June and was scared by her. I dare not come again. I wonder if all the teachers are like this.  Seeing that I highly recommend changing to a more kind receptionist, it will bring you a lot of profits. We are three or four people who want to transfer together, so you will lose a lot of students.<//Review><user>103185909997041216868< /user>< response>

When I lived in my country, I could not get a high salary, because I needed English for this, I found this school on the Internet, and now, two months later I’m already in it! The teachers are cool, they will always help, they explain topics very well, they can even joke :)<//text>

Great team of educators. I've taken courses off and on for years and they continue to update the campus and enhance the student experience. I spent 1 year in SDUIS. I really like it there. Nice campus, I liked most of my instructors, and liked the classes. Campus is a nice place to be. Every time I've had to visit the financial aid, counseling or admission dept  that they were friendly, efficient and informative! Very helpful!</Review><response>None<//response>< date>

The best school I have been to in San Diego. I came from Sao Paulo with little english. I moved from another english school to sduis because I heard about the teachers. The cost is low and I am now moving to the certificate program.</review>

<Review>The SDUIS school is, without a doubt, a great school.  Their teachers are incredible, with a clear and objective didactic and the class becomes very dynamic, especially Professor Brenda, who is very kind and attentive to all students.
I spent a great time there and learned a lot, had a fantastic experience and my English improved.
Thank you SDUIS for all the care and dedication you have with each student.<//Review>< pictures>

I should say that SDUIS offers a lot of different classes and programs for international students and residents. Their prices affordable versus other institutions giving the best learning experience and achieving professional goals! I love their office team of highly professional people. Thank you Nikky (and Olive) for making the whole process easy and fun. I should point that teachers are also matched with practical and academic experience. I took so many advantages from classes with Stephanie Clausen PhD organization development consultant, Professor Rene Edward  Ray and Florence Norris.
During all the time I’ve been studying at these institution, SDUIS’s team treated me with great care and attention. I'm also grateful to all people who work with international students for their patient and big hearts ♥️ .

I don’t think you’ll find such an amazing combination of professionalism and real doing to help with your education in just any other University!</review>< time>

<text>I have been in contact with this school regarding the PsyD program for about four months now. I have had many questions along the way that have been graciously answered by the admissions staff. When I was first recommended I looked into the school and compared it to three others. The price and curriculum found here is by far the best. Since I live in Houston it is a plus that I get to complete a good majority of this program online.<//text>< Pics>

Well as an instructor there, I enjoyed about ten percent of the students, was shocked at the quality of most of the work, ethics, and work ethic of most of the international students there. It was not accredited when I was there, and the paper record keeping was way behind the times, but it was still a wonderful opportunity to meet students from all over the world.  In the end, it wasn't a good fit for either of us but I still hear from students who I got through to.  Rampant nepotism, small family owned - took some investors over there to possibly make an offer and decided to pass in the end.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I will be very honest in this review in order to give you the opportunity to save your time,your money and your life(if you are planning get a diploma from them).First of all, this is not a real university because the standards are the lowest that I have seen here in San Diego among the others college.In general, the staff is rude and not professional at all, they don't really care about you,really...all is about money...really.I would not exaggerate the facts but I think that the worst decision that I took is to make a transfer to this school.

And in case where you have an issue concerning your status,they cancel your I20 with their most beautiful smile without to try to help you as an real University where real professional work, should do it with students.Believe me,you have to save your future and take the decisions which are in the best interest for you, that's why there are plenty of real college in the city of San Diego where you can get affordable high quality English courses given by SKILLED teacher and then get a REAL diploma and be SURE to get a job everywhere.

Don't be fool as I have been.I even not write this review to ruin their reputation because I will get nothing for that.I just want to be sincere as a smart man, about my own experience with them. I hope that this information will help you to take the best decisions for your studies.

Ps: Do your own search on the official (and legal) accreditation service affiliated to a college before to apply. Good luck to you!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80deaade255cf767:0x7976e0f2cd3fe1a</GmapID></record>

I called this school to get more information about their Masters program in Marriage and Family Therapy. I originally moved to California to further my education after finishing my Bachelors degree and have been doing a lot of shopping around at large schools in San Diego. When I did a quick google search for other programs in the area this school popped up!

When I called this school the receptionist Kristin answered. She was very polite and placed me on a brief hold while the Admissions Department was reached.

I spoke with the Admissions Department for about thirty minutes. I had many questions related to pricing, class schedule, flexibility, Professor background etc. After ending my call I received supplemental documentation to further educate me on the program.

I found myself in Old Town today and I did a walk by Campus. When I am ready to fully commit myself to a program I will be setting up a meeting. Beginning my MFT is a dream of mine and I think I may have found my perfect school. Very professional, and exceptional service.< /Text>

I was interested in their MBA program but I reconsidered. Few days ago I visited to get some information about it. After a front staff made me wait for 1hours, a woman explained about the program. But she was always watching her phone while explaining me. She was rude and no helpful.    Ultimately she recommend me TOEFL program to get referral fee. They only care about money.< /Text>

<Review>I studied at SDUIS for about two years- started taking English classes and by the time I was ready, started my Certificate in Marketing. Had great professors during this year that gave me all the knowledge I need to compete on the market.

The Staff is always helpful and ready to hear you. Also they promote little events at the campus to integrate the students. Always fun stuff!
I hardly recommend SDUIS for those who are looking for a nice and fun place to study in San Diego.< /Review>< Pics>

Updated on  06.13.2016:
The next day after I posted my review, the management contacted me and we had a meeting. I was given an opportunity to share my concerns in detail and get explanations on why the policies I disliked have to be in place. I was also told that my suggestions and complaints will be taken into consideration in the future. Although this does not fix my past experiences, I believe this was a big step forward and that's why I'm increasing my rating to 4 stars.

Previous review:
I used to be a student at this school.

I give 5 stars to almost all the teachers, the location and reasonable tuition fees. However, I give 1 star to most policies, staff members and their customer service skills.

Their registration system is very confusing and complicated. If you need any type of assistance, it's very difficult to reach the right person and get your questions answered. It takes many hours or days to get simple things resolved. They do not value the students' time at all and there have been numerous occasions when I felt treated like garbage.

The only person who is truly committed to helping students is Elvis.

Please keep in mind that laptops are not allowed in classrooms. Laptops can be such a great learning tool in the 21st century...

If you read manager's responses to some of the negative reviews, you'll see something like "please contact us" but there is no specific phone number, no email address and no name. Good luck trying to call them!

Unless you need a student visa, I recommend this school to people who like to waste their time.</text>

I finished my MBA at this school last year. I can say that it was a surprise for me to fine a school like this in San Diego. It affords good education with reasonable price. The advisers there did their best when I transferred from Colman Unvversity to this school and were very  cooperative.< /text>

I am a current student in the University programs here at SDUIS I was googling my school for reference and saw the negativity. I have to say that I have had a great time at school learning about the certificate in marketing. The staff and teachers have helped me in learning about a course I don't have knowledge about in the past.
The price is very fair and class times are good. The admissions process took time and I needed toefl. The school offers a toefl test on campus which I took. I have told my friends about this school and many have joined and enjoy their programs.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I've been studying in SDUIS since March this year and I recommend it for everyone who wants to study abroad. I've been loving my Communication course and learning so much from it...so far I've only had great professors and no complains. The campus has a great atmosphere, and I made good friends among both student body and staff, everyone is very friendly and helpful.
SDUIS has already, in only a few months, gave me several great opportunities and a career that I want to pursue, which makes me so excited about what's to come!<//review>< Pics>

Had a great experience when took the Tesol at SDUIS. My professor was excellent and gave me all the support I needed to now become a English teacher in my Country.
Also the STAFF was always helpful and ready to answer my questions when I needed.
I'm planning to go back do San Diego by the end of the year and will definitely take my Masters Degree with them again!</text>

The teachers, staff, faculty and fellow students are all friendly and really encouraging to be around. I am transferring out since I realize I want to be majoring in a major that the school does not offer but I do not regret ever having attended. I learned a lot more about the world we live in and about myself than I would have ever learned elsewhere.<//review>

I went to SDUS to get more information about the MBA program since my current school is closing. I was greeted by the front desk staf who was very kind and was able to make an appointment to speak with Niki. Nikki is very kind and explained everything to me. I am collecting my documents together and will apply soon. She is a beautiful person inside and out. She may be from Brasil but will not speak you in Portuguese :)<//review>

It's all about money. They don't care about you learn. If you need help to drop off or change your subject out of the date, forget about! They don't care if you are a good or a bad student. The Brazilian that work over there forgot where they are from. So sad we have to study there because of a visa status!!<//review>

<text>Very happy and thankful to Luis our Salesman.   He was very courteous and friendly. He came over and took his time to assist us. I've purchased cars in the past and have to say this was the easiest and only took 2 hrs to drive away with our 2013 Honda Civic. I'm so happy and will definitely tell everyone to check out Sam Linder Honda and especially Luis!! You guys Rock!!< /text>< Pics>

The service it's bad, made appointment in advance at 2pm than they told me will be ready at 330pm, they had me waiting for hrs. Even though the car was ready before the time I was told. Next time I'll just drive to Morgan Hill honda, they are better and faster and more friendly.< /text>

<text>I am writing this on behalf of my 87 year- old great aunt who purchased a car at Sam Linder Honda on 10/26/18.

My great aunt was rear ended in her 2007 Honda CR-V and wanted to purchase another Honda since they are such reliable cars.

She was shown a 2017 Honda HR-V EX w/ navigation (top of the line model) with 3,081 miles. She ended up purchasing the car in cash, wrote a check that day and drove home in her new car. I received a call that she bought a new car and wanted me to see it, I went to her house and saw the car.

She showed me the long, yellow paper which is referred to as the sales contract. I was surprised to see that in line 1a (cost before any tax, fees, etc) that she paid $26,487.74 for the vehicle. On the Honda website the MSRP of a new 2018 model was $26,540. A new one would be $52.26 more than a year old HR-V. She also got a 7 year/75,000 mile warranty for $2,235.

I looked in the glovebox to find the manual and discovered an envelope of papers. I assumed they were my great aunt's and gave them to her. She said it was a sales contract with another persons name on it. We discovered that the woman who purchased the car new one year before left her sales contract in the car. That concerned me being that the car was certified preowned and they didn't check the glovebox, did they check everything else under the hood? Upon opening it up I saw that on line 1a she paid $25,146.00 when the car was new with 59 miles on it and only $1,845 for the same warranty. My great aunt paid $1,341.74 MORE for the exact same car than the first owner did (excluding warranty).

My father, great aunt and I called and spoke to the general sales manager, Al Feria, who was very nice and helpful.

I asked why this car cost more than a new car and he explained that the two plants that produce the EX w/ navigation were out of commission which made that particular model in high demand due to there not being a lot of them. He said that the same day my aunt purchased two other people came in looking to buy it. I looked and found a like model without AWD for $21,500 with 11,000 miles on it.

I brought up that the dealership failed to check the glovebox and left the contract in it from the old owner. The phone disconnected shortly after stating the above but Al immediately returned my call. He said that some employee was getting written up for leaving the contract in the glovebox which is unfortunate but I would be furious if my personal information was left for people to find.

He kept asking how we can fix the situation and I said take the car back. He offered us $23,000 to take the car back which would have been a huge loss in money. I told him that we would would get back to him regarding the warranty and said I was going to post this online for others to see. He then began explaining all the great things Sam Linder does for the community and that he'd take the review personally. I politely ended the call by saying that nothing else needed to be said and I was getting frustrated.

Call it what you want, but I feel that my great aunt was taken advantage of and essentially got ripped off.<//text><rating>1<//rating>< resp>

<Text>Honda was really nice to my family and me. We purchased a car on 3/6/21 and ask for Hector. Hector really takes his time to shop for a car with you and is very loyal to his customers. He is a really nice guy and i will do more business with Honda and him. If you are looking to purchase a car with this dealership ask for Hector!</Text>< Pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><review>The service department here is terrible. I bought a used Honda CR-V from another dealer about a hour and a half away and decided to get what’s called a pre-purchase inspection done at Sam Linder Honda. Before dropping the car off I had two concerns: noisy brakes and a noise coming from the rear of the vehicle. Sam Linder’s service department took the car in and didn’t find anything wrong other than it needing an alignment and a brake fluid change. With 40,000 miles on the odometer I figured OK sounds fair. Between the cost of the inspection and the two services I paid over $400. When the car was ready I picked it up after hours when I got out of work. IMMEDIATELY as I was heading home I noticed something was wrong. When I got on the highway I felt a vibration under the front end and after arriving home I heard a ping from the right side every time I turned the wheel. Before even getting out of the car I messaged the service advisor on their messaging service about the two issues. I made it clear that both of these new issues were not present before the car was in there shop. She responded the next morning and asked if I could bring the car back. My wife had some appointments the following few days and we could not take it in right away. We set an appointment for them to take a look at the vehicle a couple weeks later. Initially, during the ride along the tech claimed he couldn’t hear/feel anything but later confirmed he heard the pinging. They told my wife we would need to pay another $180 to have it diagnosed. Naturally I thought that was absurd given the fact we did not have these issues prior to bringing the car in. I called and eventually spoke with the service manager who was quick to tell me there was no way they caused the issues. He pulled up the initial report and I asked if it was possible they did the alignment wrong. He said no because “they only checked the alignment.” I told him no I PAID to have the alignment done. He sounded confused and asked me to hold on. A few moments later he tells me go ahead and bring the car back in and they’ll check everything to make sure the work was done right. I stopped him and asked for clarification on whether or not the alignment I PAID for was actually done. He completely sidestepped the question and repeated for me to just bring the car in and they’ll check it out. I reluctantly agreed thinking he’ll never admit it but at least they’ll get it done now and tell me what else is wrong with the car. Boy was I wrong. After taking the car back in (3rd time now) he tells me everything looks fine but they do hear the noise and will need to charge me $180 for a diagnosis. There is no way I’m paying for something that either they caused or (had it been there all along) they should have caught in the initial inspection I paid over $400 for! I shared my frustration and asked if I had brought the car right back in after initially picking it up and not waited would he still have charged me the $180? To which he literally said to me “Absolutely, you'd be surprised how many times people leave and come right back saying ‘you just did my oil change now my_______ isn’t working’.” At that point I thought I better just get my car the heck out of there before they screw it up even more.

Update: Where I bought the vehicle and my dealings with them is none of your concern. You’re concern should be what is going on your service department.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1618023291651, 'text': 'If true will be happy to refund you.

<review>Decided I didn't want the new 2020 Insight after the first 3 or so miles I put on it  but After Sales Manager Al Feria called and threatened me with court I realized I have to live with it.
Amazing car by the way and friendly staff.

<Review>Worst customer service ever! Bought my first car a couple months ago and they we’re so nice but once I needed a fix on the car they would beat around the bush on what is covered by my extended warranty and basically told me to figure things out by myself. NEVER AGAIN WILL I PURCHASE A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
Had to order a part for son's car. I walked into Customer Service area where 3 men and 1 woman worked. No one greeted or helped as I stood there...ALL aware I was there. A Caucasian  man walked in 8 minutes after I did, and was greeted and helped almost immediately. I jumped in behind him to get help to get directed to the right area. The heavyset man and older Asian man had offered no help even after they had finished with other customers. The young man in the Parts dept, was very courteous and helpful. I HAD to get receipt from secretary on the side who also displayed poor customer service(I shared my experience about the other dept. to drop her a hint about her snobby attitude..she didn't get it) Picked up part 2 days later and the other Parts dept. man was also courteous and helpful. After reading other reviews, I'm so thankful we didn't purchase my son's  car there!</Review>

I've always been sceptical of having service done at dealerships but Sam Kinder has proven to be a square dealer. They have handled all of the service on our Honda Pilot for 140,000 miles and they have never failed to keep me happy.< /Text>

I had a recall done there. They were very friendly and helpful. I didn't wait very long and had a great experience in the service department. I would recommend Sam Linder Honda service department to anyone who needs service or even their knowledgeable techs can help you out on anything. If they don't have an answer to your question. They can get back to you with an answer promptly.</Review>

So happy with my new car! Sales and Finance really help you get what you really want. I couldn't be anymore happier with it all. Have been to several dealerships at the Salinas auto mall and none of them compare to Sam Linder Honda great customer service.
If your looking to buy a car ask for ANTHONY!!
THANK YOU so much Sam Linder Honda for everything!<//Review>

Despite having agreed on a Costco price the dealer quickly changed their mind and raised the price at the last minute asking for more. The salesmen also seemed to give overly optimistic estimates on car availability. Didnt feel this is an honest dealer</Review>

<Text>Imad is the man! I came in from out of state to purchase a used Range Rover and Imad helped me through the process and even aftewards has been very helpful with paperwork, etc.  I have nothing but good things to say about Imad and Sam Linder Honda. I would highly recommend them.

I found a Range Rover with the exact color scheme (interior/exterior) I wanted and arranged to fly in and then drive off the lot the same day. Imad and his finance person stayed with me until everything was done and I was satisfied, I left about 9pm, an hour after they normally close but they were both more than willing to stay late and finish the deal so I could get on my way (I had to be back in Washington the next day).  I am very pleased with the vehicle and especially the service, thanks guys!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<review>The service department never answers the phone, and doesn't return phone calls either.

Now I'm not insulting the people in the service department, they are all clearly busy, hardworking, and in my experience, kind.

This is a management issue. I call, and 2 seconds later the front desk answers, transfers me to service, then the phone is never answered. You have one employee literally doing nothing (zero wait time) at the front desk, and everyone in service is so slammed constantly that they don't have time to answer the phone or return calls.

Why don't you guys allow the front desk person to book repairs? Instead of having a physical book logging all the repairs, why not have a Google dock or spreadsheet everyone can edit? That way that receptionist can get a dollar raise and start actually working as hard as the people in service. Regardless of how you do it, the system doesn't work as is.

Before Christmas, I called service to request a quote on roof racks for my CRV. My call was never answered, and my voicemail was not returned. More recently I called again with no answer and did not bother to leave a voicemail. Simply put, I come here to pay hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on repairs. I expect to have my phone calls answered, thank you.

+1 stars for the excellent and professional service I have received in person from Frank despite his being very busy.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< userid>

Very high pressure sales team. Finance department makes it seem like if you don't buy a car that day your wasting their time.  They really tried to make me agree if they can meet the payment I was after that I would guarantee to take the car. I guess they can't just give you a quote and let you think about it. I hate that there is a middle person and your making a deal with a mysterious person in a magical room, they try to sell all these extra warranties and alarm etc.  By the time everything is said and done their making like 15k in extra in interest and insurances. Definitely not purchasing a car from Sam Linder!< /text>

Absolutely the opposite of the 4 other Honda dealers I tried to do business with.  They were Honest and upfront from the get -go.   I was not the most pleasant person to deal with since I was already super frustrated at not being able to get the Honda Pilot I wanted.  Omar was so patient and totally made the process painless.   I drove 1-1/2 hours to Salinas and it was worth every minute.  I can't recommend them enough.</review>

<Text>Took my car for a service about a week ago. Before I got there, the car looked like it always has. I left my car here for a service, came to pick it up and saw this noticeable scratch on the front right bumper of my car. I was so disappointed that they denied that anything happened to my car while it was there. Car came in scratch free and was returned with a scratch. They just don't take responsibility for anything that goes wrong. They are such Scrooges. The manager even brought a "professional" to inspect the scratch to determine if it happened within "24 hours" but like I expected, the guy said it didn't happen there. For all I know, they must have both agreed to just deny that the scratch happened there because they know it would cost them. They offered a cheapy, crappy offer but it was not worth it. Why do I have to pay for something that was not my fault? My advice, take your car for service elsewhere and buy a car from another Honda dealer. You will save money and time!<//Text>< UserId.>

<Review>Went in to have my airbags replaced and it was a completely free service. The shuttle was a little slow on time, but I understand seeing as there are other customers who need it. Overall good experience and nothing seemed to be broken or misplaced.
Went another day to look at buying another car with my boyfriend. John, the salesman, was helpful, but a bit too assertive in trying to sell us a vehicle. We wanted to explore our options and he understood, but still tried to get us to purchase. As we left, John forgot to give my boyfriend his registration form for his car. We did not realise this until we went to the dealership across and they asked us for those papers.
Good service, pushy salesman.< /Review>< Date>

Went to this dealer with a friend because we were curious about a couple cars on the lot. As soon as the guy who approached us found out we weren't going to buy a car, they seemed very uninterested in doing anything with us. He said "if you're buying a car then I can do that for you but if not, we have other customers to help." He added that if we wanted to wait a little he could get someone for us but we waited about 20 minutes and no one came out so we just left.

This place just seems uninterested in working with new potential customers. The other dealers we went to in the area had good hospitality and let us test drive the cars we wanted. I get that they're in the business of selling cars but if I was truly in the market for a car right now, this experience would definitely cross this dealership off my list of places to give my business to.< /text>

<review>Went to several dealerships from Visalia to Santa Cruz looking for a new Honda Civic. I’m the type of person that likes to “shop around”, and “do my homework”. I ended up coming back to this dealership several times to test drive and go over all the different models and prices.
Huge THANKS to A.J. SOTO. Thank You for putting in the work, giving me great customer service, going over every last detail, programming my door locks & car settings, and of course “getting me the best deal possible”.... Thank you Sam Linder for the great service.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>As a first time buyer I never would have imagined buyin a car being so easy. The gentleman Cesar who initially help me was absolutely courteous, respectful, and beyond helpful. In shopping for a Honda Civic it was the complete opposite experience I had at another local Honda dealer. I drove off with both the car and deal I was looking for. I would absolutely recommend Sam Linders for any first time buyer!<//Review>< Pics>

This could probably be said of plenty of dealers but...

We went to look at cars, and they were completely uninterested in helping us. When someone finally came out to check on us we talked for a bit but when it was found that we weren’t buying a car THAT DAY they pretty much implied we should just leave because they have real customers to deal with.

I get it, you guys need sales. I really do. But spending upward of 10 large on a car is no small decision and I’m not going to make a purchase that large in one day without sleeping on it. Take some lessons from your neighbors on the auto mall, because the Kia and Mazda lots are nowhere near as pushy nor as angry if you’re not ready to plunk down THAT day.<//Review>

<Review>Worst service ever by Edward who quoted a time and services were not complete. When brought to his attention he denied saying that. When checked out he didn't even have the courtesy to let me know what they did not finish. Spoke to Sharon on matter and she was no help at all not a good representative for customer service. Also shuttle took over 45 min to come back we ended up walking. Will not return to this location again.< /Review>< Date>

<Review>I was in the market for a new Honda Civic hatchback touring, the MSRP is $29645, and this dealership offered me a price of $27500.
At first glance it seemed like a great sale. The dealership had 3 Honda Civic Hatchback Tourings, 2 blue and 1 sonic gray. When I showed interest in the sonic gray they immediately changed the offer of $27500 back to a firm MSRP. Because of the "rare" color . The saleman John Alvarado as well as his manager Dan came out to speak with me to tell me a blatant lie that there's only 2 sonic gray civics for sale in California and they can't sell it me for the discussed price of $27500. The best they could do was knock $500 off the MSRP due to a military discount. So I went to a Honda dealership in Seaside and they got me a sonic gray Honda civic sport touring for $27,900.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>I would have given 5 stars if not for the weak attempt to sneak an extended warranty into the deal.  Otherwise, Imad and Sean provided a good car buying experience, as far as car buying experiences go. I would have preferred the negotiation process to have been less dramatic, and definitely wished the paperwork process would have gone much more quickly. Or at least, if it's really necessary to have us wait in the little cubby for 2 hours, provide free snacks and drinks, and maybe a bowl of Lego blocks, to ease the pain of sitting and waiting.< /text>< Pics>

<review>I took my Honda Pilot in for a simple oil change and picked it up later the day.  When I got home I realized that two of the magnetic signs on my car were gone.  I went back to the dealership and they told me that they had removed the signs to wash the car (a service that I had not asked for) and they said that the signs were put back on.  I told them that the signs must have been replaced improperly and blown off during my highway drive home.

I purchased new signs and gave them the bill for $109.26 which I was told they would pay.  It's been 2 months and multiple phone calls to both Sharon, who is incredibly rude, and Oscar.  Still no check.

Because THEY decided to wash my car and did not put the signs back on properly, I am out $100!  I will never go back to Sam Linder's dealership in Salinas.  They are customer service at it's worst.<//review><response>None< /response><rating>1<//rating><Pics>None< /Pics><username>Jim Claghorn< /username><Time>1506622361697< /Time><user>103005646636012845151< /user><gmap_id>0x808dff10777587eb:0x7d08bd70f003fbfe</gmap_id></record>

Called to check price as I driving down from SF bay area for Odyssey EX-L. Told them it  did not make sense to drive with out having a sense of price.  Spoke with Jose and no interest in doing business.  Seems like they are intent on wasting time and wearing customers down before they buy - Not a good place to buy cars.< /text>

My family member bought a CRV back in January of this year and recently started having trouble making her payment. She asked me to see if there was anything Sam Linder Honda could do to help her, I wasn't very optimistic since she had bought the car 6 months ago. When I called I was put in contact with the Sales Manager Al Feria, which turned out to be a blessing! Al was very receptive to her situation and started looking at her options immediately. He was able to get her into a brand new Civic and lower her payment by $250.00 a month. I have to tell this was best experience I have ever had with any car Dealership, Thanks Al!< /review>

<text>My first experience with Honda service at Sam Linder was not good.  My tire pressure light went on while driving just two weeks after taking ownership.  I called Sam Linder service department and left three message over two days.  Having none of my messages returned, I took the car in.  They found the tires were over significantly over inflated.  How does this happen when they supposedly do a careful inspection before any car leaves the lot?  They told me it could not have left that way - basically saying I over inflated the tires!  Why would I do that?  All they needed to do was apologize but instead have made me one angry Accord owner.  I'll find other service options thank you very much.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808dff10777587eb:0x7d08bd70f003fbfe</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Dear Sam Linder Honda,
I have just recently moved here from Nebraska with my fiance for military reasons and we went to you hoping to do business and replace my endlessly broken down Buick. Unfortunately however due to your salesman Jim Cash we will not be doing business with you now or ever. Not when it's time to replace the car we got somewhere else and not when I have children who need a vehicle. Due to Jim Cash and his dishonesty, complete and utter lack of respect and total disinterest in doing his job we took our business elsewhere. Not only will we not do business with you but neither will my mother, who is looking to replace her vehicle, but also my fiance's work team, unit and superiors are less than thrilled at our treatment and more than willing to take their business elsewhere as well. So congratulations to Jim Cash on losing your company literally generations of customers. Not to mention the thousands of dollars that would have come with them. Well done.</Review>< pictures>

I just purchased a new 2013 Honda Accord and I was treated with respect and ease. I would refer anyone. In addition the dealer is a Motor Trend dealer, and I got free key replacement and free dent repair also!<//Text>

Their GM is the picture perfect example of the slippery, fast talking used car salesman who thinks he's cool. I had to go to the DMV and find out that they were in violation of two CA Vehicle Codes before he would help. Between my sister and myself, we have purchased 3 cars from this dealer and used their service departments. Retaining customers is not important to them.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>The "Motor Trend" van I purchased with the implicite thorough inspection was presented as a no hit, impeccable vehicle. I found evidence of body damage - concealed - broken interior parts - only one of two keys (which is still wanting 3 years later). The milage was much lower than promised. I was going to unwind the sale based on fraud, but was persuaded by the head of used car sales to keep the car as he knew of a way to fix the milage (which turned out to be useless for MY can). Altogether reinforces the image of the slippery used car salesman.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Call them on (5/22/17) because my acura tsx steering had a problem and it was the rack and pinion. They said they had one and to come in. So i got a tow truck from san ardo all the way here and when i got there i told the guy that i called earler and told them the guy i spoke too. And told me they did not have the part. So i got stuck here for more then 2 hours getting a another tow truck to take me to another dealership to replace my part!<//review>< userid>

<Name>Oscar Rocha</Name><Text>I bought a 2006 Chrysler 300 Touring about 1 month ago, great customer service before you sign contract, after signing contract to purchase the car, the dealer (from salinas) were seriously the most hard people to work with, they sold me a car with the heater not working, the back window not working, and the check engine light came up about a week after buying the car. I called the dealer to let them know what was going on, and they said that they had to go threw some approval process before then can work on it, so i waited about 3-4 days, they then gave me a call back and said that they were gonna fix the check engine light, the heater, but not the back window, i was so mad, i mean they should up step up and fixed everything because the car didnt even have half a week and these problems came up. It should be illegal to sell a car that has problems. So i left the car there for a few days and then they said they had fixed the check engine light and the heater, BUT the heater was still not working, and once again i had to wait for approval, which makes no sense because the had already approved it, and the problem was never fixed so why did i have to wait again for approval??? I literally had to have a blanket with me in the mornings and at night due to the heater not working, it took about another week to hear from them, and the service team said that the sales department didnt want to approve it, but that they were gonna help me out to fix it anyways. It was such an inconvenience to have to go threw all these. THEY SHOULD OF FIXED THE PROBLEM WITH IN THAT FIRST WEEK WHEN I TOLD THEM, ITS CALLED "CUSTOMER SERVICE"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I told the sales manager and the sales guy that we decided to go with this dealer because they were known and we knew we weren't gonna run into problems like the other small dealers around,  BUT BOY WERE WE WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO SHOP AT  THE SALINAS SAM LINDER!!!!!</Text></record>

It's like most car buying experiences. You have to watch your wallet with add on's. Then you leave not really knowing how good of a deal you just received.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I went to see a honda accord 2020 and the seller asked me for my information only for an estimate and I swear it would not affect my credit, a day later I got an email that had -7 points on my credit 😡 and he was upset and treated me very bad just because I didn't want to give him $ 5,000 down payment

<review>Phenomenal service, gave me an estimate of 9 days and shaved it down to an impressive 4 days. I wish I could be more satisfied but they have checked off every item of the list of not only being a great business, but employing great people.</review>< name>

I am so impressed with this company and Steven.  I have used them several times for insurance repairs and have always been extremely happy.  But when I had a couple of small problems with a used truck I had bought I was not sure if they took care of small repairs.  I was so amazed at how they treated my minor repair. They took care of me and my used truck like I was a big project paying thousands of dollars.  They even took the time to wash my truck when they were done.  They made my day.  You can trust them to take great care of you.</text>

<Review>They were very kind and helpful. I am disabled and they went out of their way to help move my personal belongings to the rental car that they set up for me since my insurance had failed to do so. They did such good work you could never know anything ever happened.<//Review>< rate>

We have used Ben Clymer's in the past for repairs and have always received excellent service. We recently moved out of state and needed a small part painted as it came non-painted from the manufacturer. Contacted Jason Kittay and Joe Willey and they agreed to us shipping old and new parts to their shop. They matched the paint perfectly and it was flawless! We only trust Ben Clymer's with our paint needs. They have always given us exceptional customer service and professional workmanship!! Thank you for making this recent repair (even long distance) so easy!!</Text>

I was referred by my insurance company for damage to my bumper. I literally hung up the phone with my insurance agent, and a representative from Ben Clymers was already contacting me to schedule my appointment. They were extremely knowledgeable, professional, and made the drop off, communication, pick up of my vehicle STRESS FREE! Thank you to everyone at Ben Clymers for the exceptional service!<//review>

<name>Alexandria Strachan<//name><Date>1548224272375</Date><rating>1< /rating><Review>I had a simple bumper repair, and had issues with the moment I drove it off the lot. There was a weird sound my engine was making and they found a rag they left in my engine that ended up getting sucked up into something. My bumper was also never fully attached correctly. I thought I was just being picky, but then I took my car into the dealer to get an appraisal to sell it, and they said “Whoever did your bumper was horrible!” That really hit hard. 😑 I would recommend somewhere else, that took pride in their work.

Update: I actually confirmed with my husband that he was told it wasn’t a rag, but sandpaper! Even worse, in my opinion. On the same day the battery strap wasn’t connected and was completely missing.  The bumper never sat right. It had a full gap around the connection to the hood and grill.

Getting into a car accident is already stressful enough, the last thing that you want to worry about is the repairs being done correctly and having trustworthy mechanics/body shop workers .  The only reason I am writing this update is because of what the loss this company has brought to my family.  When I went to go get my appraisal the appraiser told me that my car is worth less because of the repairs that they have to remake to the repairs that were made.

The customer service was great but the work is not good. I would rather have bad service and great repairs. Hopefully we can get a local shop that can deliver both.  We are still waiting for a phone call from the manager. When the manager contacts me I will update.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1548184410126, 'text': 'Hi Alexandria this is not the our standard here , I will try calling you to arranged to have things set right for you.

The best body shop you'll find. Quick and easy drop off, Brian, David and Joe let you know exactly what they're gonna do and how much it's gonna cost before you hand them the keys. Tyler the parts guy pre ordered parts and my vehicle was done two days later. Every one is super friendly and knowledgeable in there fields. Highly recommend this shop if you want proper work done with OEM parts.< /text>

Worst experience ever, only reason I picked the shop as based on there reviews.
There communication with me was weak, of course after insurance paid for the job, they took there sweet time of almost 7 weeks.
On top of that I get the car back, and it's not even finish, along with the over spray on the inside of my interior all on the leather seats.
Once I notice all this they said they would make it right weeks go by, dont answer my calls and dont call me back.

ALTHOUGH, in the process, they messed up the paint on my car. The material they used to cover my car while getting fixed, left residue spots all over the car. I brought this issue to their attention. I had to leave the car there 2 different times. The issue still didn't get fixed. They told me to leave it again, but I lost their trust on resolving this issue. This Nissan means alot to me because it is my first NEW car that I have purchased. It hurts to see that someone else messed up the paint.  They tried using a clay bar as well as myself but the marks do not come off.  I have tried using wax also, but spots  are still there.<//Review>< user_name>

They do excellent work and they are very friendly. I highly recommend Ben Clymer's if you get into a car accident. This is the body shop you want your vehicle to be. Even if you just need a paint job. They'll take care of you. I have been to 3 of the Ben Clymer's and they all have excellent amazing customer service. Yucaipa, Moreno Valley and riverside. Thank you Ben Clymer's The Body Shop.👍👍👍👍< /Text>

Repairs  had been done a year and a half or so prior but I was getting uneven ware on the effected side. I took my car in and had the alignment done and they also fixed a door that wasn't locking with the key. This was all done in one day and they were able to get it back to me before I needed to leave to work that night. Thank you guys and girls at Ben Clymer's (Yucaipa).< /Review></record>

The manager took genuine personal interest in our situation and worked with us through everything. I don't usually get that feeling from car places. I knew our satisfaction was his priority and really appreciate that. The car is now actually a lot cleaner and new looking than it was and drives fine with no weird rattles or pulling that you almost expect when a car has been in an accident.

<Review>Scam artists. Left me with a rental bill they are responsible for. Took my car in for a minor bumper dent, that my insurance was paying for. The employee "Russ" got into an argument with my insurance over needing more time with the car and refusing to pay for a rental car extension and hung up on them. Car was supposed to be ready Thursday, Russel claims the car was ready Friday and called me but he did not and when I called him Saturday said it wasn't ready till monday. I have proof I called Saturday but Russ says he's got video cameras and never received a call. This was weeks ago and I've never received any calls from them. In the process of filling complaints with BBB. In short do not come here find another shop, they are no reliable or hoenst.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Luckily they had insurance and they directed me to Ben Clymers body shop to look at the damage. Brian set it all up and helped me deal with the insurance company. Nice to have someone who knows what they're talking about on your side. He convinced the adjuster to repair all the damage properly without cutting corners - thank you Brian. Brian then asked me what rental car I would like because they have a Enterprise office right there. He sorted it all out and I got to drive around in a brand new sexy black Dodge Challenger for a week lol. When the car was done one week later I just returned the rental to Brian and picked up my new looking, totally detailed Infinity. That wasn't bad at all. Thank you for being so professional and making it so easy.</text>< pics>

Its a real world and my impression was this place was a good people place. Seemed to have terrific liquor selection. Be warned the have a stocked store so you could easily spend $50 on the stores opportuny to grocery shop but this might be unwise for a person trying to make a dollar stretch. Then again the customer service is almost worth it.<//Review>

We all know the neighborhood gets ruff, but theres never been a time when I have felt unsafe. They stay stocked and supplied with the best merchandise and if they don't have it, it doesn't exist!!

My family and I went here to use our Fun Cards we got for Christmas. We had a BLAST! My family and I got to enjoy Lazer Tag, Go-Karts racing (my children drove on the smaller kid carts and then were passengers on the big karts), mini golf, paddle boats, a bumper chair ride, the batting cages and arcade games.

For lunch we had the family pack which had 10 slices of pizza, 4 drinks some wings and a few celery sticks.

My family ended up spending 6 hours here and I know my children will be asking to go back here soon.

The service was okay. The staff were all young adults as far as I saw and didn't talk unless they had to.< /Text>

< review>
Great place to take your kids for a birthday party!  We brought our daughter here for her 7th birthday.

We purchased the ultimate birthday party package.

All of the kids enjoyed unlimited rides on the go karts, bumper cars, paddle boats, miniature golf, and laser tag!  Plus, each received a card good for $15 of arcade play.

The staff was fantastic! Everyone was very attentive and patient with our gaggle of kids running around.

The kids enjoyed pizza and cake. For the adults we were able to purchase turkey sandwich trays, boneless buffalo wings, boneless BBQ wings, green salad.

Unlimited soft drinks were included, and the adults were able to purchase a variety of draft beers if wanted.

Overall, everyone had a good time.

And, there's something really magical about not having to clean up after the party!<//review>

It's not just for kids. We loved laser tag and the slick car track. Batting cages and spinning bumper cars were fun too. Sorry that they'll be closing down in February. Hope that the staff all get placed at new jobs before the shut down.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Had a wonderful grandchildren weekend, 1 if the stops was Mulligans. Discovered that miniature golf was not for my 4 year old, but great for our 9-yesr old boy. Had a great time!  After it, the boat ride was good for Kiki and the smaller race cars good for Kai. Will come back with Kai for sure.</Review><Response>{'time': 1557788336064, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your feedback!'}<//Response><Date>1557633239912< /Date><UserId.>105368983755531578252</UserId.>< name>

I like that you can bring your own food and sit in the non reserved picnic areas. I was disappointed in the arcade expense. Games range from $.75 to $2.50 maybe more. Ridiculous!!!</Review>< resp>

Took the kids here, 4 of us spend $50 on a pass and got $20 free! Go karts, laser tag were the big hits and what the kids were I interested in! We went on a sunday and wasn't too busy although there were a lot of kids party's they didn't affect the lines.  Laser tag was a little disappointing as each game only lasted 5 mins and was about $8.50pp but the boys loved it so as it was so quiet and no one waiting, they were able to play against eachother!
Wpuld deffinately visit again with them!</Text>

The family enjoyed the pizza, drinks and atmosphere.

The video games were awesome. There's even a virtual video game, which the crowd couldn't get enough of.

Points are earned points as you play, which are credited to your game card and used to redeem prizes.

February 27, 2020 (I believe) is the advertised closing date.

So if you want to go, now would be the time!<//review>

Really fun to do and plus on Tuesdays you get like half off or something and they have mini golf and go-karts I say will be the best place to go when you have nothing to do and have fun with your mom and dad for kids< /Review>

If you're trying to take two kids of different sizes they may not be able to ride the same rides.

<Text>So much fun. We went early but still pretty crowded so we rushed through our golfing but still had fun. Seems like a great place for a bday. There is miniature golfing, an arcade, snacks, batting cages. I also heard they have laset tag but didnt try that. Bring your own snacks because we are talking movie theater prices. And buy a package unless just golfing.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Great place to bring your kids and have a great time. I brought my 9yr old and we only stayed just over an hour but in that time we tried the miniature golf and the go cart track, which by the way was awesome. We'll be back real soon...</Text>

Points are earned points as you play, which are credited to your game card and used to redeem prizes.

February 27, 2020 (I believe) is the advertised closing date.

So if you want to go, now would be the time!<//text>< Pictures>

Our cards didn't come with the bonus $10 they advertise for purchasing all day play passes. And let me not get to the cleanliness of the restroom because the only thing possibly sanitary was the outside door. It was filthy!!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7fLFr8qiji4ajypE3CDF8-yFKBIGCUmVoUUVw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dd4a820920bddd:0xf7f93c345c295141<//GmapID></record>

Did my volleyball team banquet here. Very helpful, gave us a table we all could fit at and the kids had fun. Went on bargain Tuesday. Best bang for your buck.<//Text>

It's as simple as a family place can be.  Which is perfect if you want that big impression with little money.  Unlimited rides and laser tag is perfect for me and my boys. 56" for driver with 40" for passenger.  Driver for doubles have to be 18+ years old. 70 pounds for rock climbing. 80 pounds and less for the boats. And 40" for bumper cars.<//Review>

<Review>First, I did not drive so access to public transportation is crucial. The public bus stop was on the main street leaving us to walk three blocks. I was satisfied with the walking distance. My niece and nephew enjoyed themselves completely despite riding two attractions the entire time we were there. They were too old for the padde boats. I thought for sure they would be interested in the rock climbing wall and maybe the miniature golf but I was wrong. Speed and driving captured their attention so the bumper cars and the go carts were the only two attractions that held their fascination. I spent $75 for a ticket card which is swiped at each attraction. The place gives additional funds so I had a total of $120 to spend. My niece and nephew were also able to play some of the games in the arcade area. I spent cash for pizza and drinks another $23.00. The place was crowded hosting many children's parties. But the longest wait happen to be for the go carts. When you are in the public, expect some wait time which for all of us waiting in line was fine while we talked while watching the people and the activity.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dd4a820920bddd:0xf7f93c345c295141<//gmapID><date>1535844959673<//date><name>Karen Graves< /name></record></dataset><record>

All rides and games were working. The food is your standard fare pizza, chicken strips, nachos. It was tasty and served within about 20 minutes.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Besides the staff I encountered who were all very helpful, happy and upbeat, this place wasn't worth the 30 miles I drove to get there.  I took my two and seven year old and their 10 year old cousin. With all the weight and height limitations they weren't able to ride anything together. We waited at two different "ride/attractions" for quite some time before anyone came to let the kids on. It wasn't busy, it just seemed like no one was manning their posts. Not a place for toddlers! I did more chasing him around trying to make sure he wasn't getting into anything he wasn't supposed to, wich was EVERYTHING. The paddle boats we're not what I was expecting, maybe because past experiences I have had we're never like that. They are basically oversized rubber duckies the kids paddle like a bicycle in an oversized jacuzzi. I'm not saying this place is horrible. If I lived closer to it and it was a little cheaper, it might be a go to place once every six months or so. The mini golf was cool. I'm just saying don't take little kids. Don't drive to far to get there, it's not worth that.< /Review>

<text>It's nice place to enjoy with kids, bunch of games for kids. We gave 12$ and enjoyed go cart, Mini golf, rock climbing, laser tag. For kids they had few ride on rides for 1$ and some other for free. The only pain is it's too crowded, so for everything there is long wait. Specially for go card u have to wait for around 30 min, and then few of there cars will not work...< /text><Date>1524681846892<//Date><user_id>115579871072791990244</user_id><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I went there for a friend's birthday and we had a blast there. Go karts were great, arcade had variety, and the staff there were very friendly. I would definitely recommend having a day there and getting the wristband. You can get alot more out of it than buying singular passes, unless you're there for the arcade. The arcade itself can have some steep prices for games so go in with a  plan if you're in for the tickets. Otherwise have fun.
Taking off a star for the price of food which is a tad high for my tastes compared to the quality and quantity of it for that matter. It's to be expected for an establishment like that but that doesn't excuse it. If you have a full party going on, the food might be better with the special catering, I'm not 100% sure.
Overall, good place for family fun, attentive staff and security all about, and worth the trip.</review>

<Review>Played mini golf for first time in many years with my brother. Decent course. Good staff and service. great for the whole family. they actually even have beer for the adults and a place to go smoke cigarettes without bothering other people especially children. I've only been once but would certainly go back again. have fun be safe. good luck! :-).</Review>< user_id>

<Text>For the South Bay area, this is a very reasonably-priced birthday party venue for kids of all ages. Also, park passes that aren't used during the birthday party can be used at a later date. Just be careful if you visit the park while Boys & Girls Club South Bay is here as many of those kids use profane language in the presence of young children and their chaperones don't do anything about it.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Our cards didn't come with the bonus $10 they advertise for purchasing all day play passes. And let me not get to the cleanliness of the restroom because the only thing possibly sanitary was the outside door. It was filthy!!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7fLFr8qiji4ajypE3CDF8-yFKBIGCUmVoUUVw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

My son loves the pedal boats and the kids go kart track. It's great that they have a separate slower track for kids so I don't have to worry about him getting injured by some kid who is driving crazy. Golf n stuff go karts are dangerous but here at mulligans I am happy my son is so much safer<//Text>

The place is great although some of the employees don’t care about the job and simply give you what you asked without taking the time to make sure everything is good. The mini golf is amazing! I recommend to be there early though. (The wrist band is worth it)<//review>

<text>I mainly go to Mulligan's when they have specials. To me, the Hawaiian Laua is the best deal ever! The only problem I had at the event was, I was riding in the go-karts and some young boys got mad because they couldn't pass me. So, they teamed up and rammed my go-kart from behind so hard that  I thought I had whiplash. When I got out of the kart. I had a mild headache and a tingling sensation in my left hand and toes. That tingling lasted off and on for a good couple of months. So, if you go, be careful and courtesy to those needing to pass you so you don't get hurt like I did!</text>< Response>

I went for my 30th bday with some of my friends and our kids since I wanted to share the day with my 6 year old daughter. We had a blast. All the workers were ok, especially a man by the name of Eric. He was excellent. There was an african American female worker who I assume was a shift supervisor because she was telling a guy at the rock wall he would be leaving early. She was rude, childish and unprofessional. My husband went to the bathroom and shortly after we headed to the go carts. We ended up going the wrong way and had to walk all the way back to the entrance of go carts. As we entered my husband joined us but soon realized he too was going the wrong way outside the bars and walked all the way around to join us. The worker argued with us saying we would have to ride separate because there is no holding spots. She ended up letting us ride but we all rode without no one at there posts on the track, except Eric, because they all crowed around her as she joked, chased and tickled the other workers. All in all it was cool but we were all bored after a couple hours< /text>

Went here with family and we had fun. They have an all day pass for $33. arcades are fun. Golf is small but nice. They gave out free water. Laser tag was by far the best for me. batting cages is also good.<//review>

<review>Great place to bring the family small kinds don't really have to much stuff to do but it's things there for them. Grandparents will also have a nice time there watching the kids. You can bring food in also, there picnic benches inside on the side. First come first served.< /review>< pics>

Arcade is a little overpriced but overall great for kids of all ages. The staff is super helpful and very patient. The manager on shift Jasmine was sooo nice and accommodating she made a good experience great. Make sure to arrive early to avoid long lines.</text>

It was good but it would be better if they would add more attractions but other than that it was good. The food was good and the waits for some attractions weren't slow. It's great for hosting parties</text>

<review>I went for my boyfriend's birthday just for fun and it was so packed on a Saturday. The mini golfing took the longest time and we ended up wasting $30 and 2 hours for like 3 holes. We had to skip a lot and didn't even get to do some because people didn't understand you take turns I guess? This place would've been nice if there were less people lol...< /review><Rate>3<//Rate><Name>Amie Nguyen< /Name>< Time>

We came for a football team party and the staff were courteous and very helpful with our party. The go karts were my favorite and they also have Lazer tag which was a lot of fun.

Super busy on the weekends of course but otherwise definitely will come back again.</Review>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>it's poor. the game cards they give you don't even work. there were multiple games where my card wouldnt work no matter how many times I slid it. you have to swipe it back and forth 20x for the game to work. someone played a game which earned them 1,000 tickets, and it took the machine 5 minutes to even give them 100 tickets on their card. the terrain for mini golf is cheap and starting to come apart. the go-karts are really slow, and everyone overlapped me when I was pressing hard on the gas pedal. the lazer tag was so old, it reminded me of the 80s, because of how outdated it was. the only fun thing was the non-traditional bumper cars. for a place like that, you can definitely see why the lines were short. please don't go here, go to golfnstuff or something. oh yeah and you should clean your carpet.<//Review>< Pics>

It's a lot smaller than i thought. The one ride they have is whack. The miniature golf course is sorta weird. They need more help and better card system. Some of their arcade games don't work which is whack because they are already small. But that card system is horrible...</Review>

< Review>
I enjoy this place.  The park needs to figure out a way to stop the people from crashing into people that are parked in the pit.  I know they power down the cars, but maybe a brake button. on the final lap.  The single x double xx is a badge of honor for these people.  The all day pass is the way to go.  I would like to see a discounted pass for all day for laser laser tag and go karts.<//Review>

< review>
it's poor. the game cards they give you don't even work. there were multiple games where my card wouldnt work no matter how many times I slid it. you have to swipe it back and forth 20x for the game to work. someone played a game which earned them 1,000 tickets, and it took the machine 5 minutes to even give them 100 tickets on their card. the terrain for mini golf is cheap and starting to come apart. the go-karts are really slow, and everyone overlapped me when I was pressing hard on the gas pedal. the lazer tag was so old, it reminded me of the 80s, because of how outdated it was. the only fun thing was the non-traditional bumper cars. for a place like that, you can definitely see why the lines were short. please don't go here, go to golfnstuff or something. oh yeah and you should clean your carpet.</review>

Lines were a bit longer than expected, but overall well worth the $15 cover for Easter. Including breakfast! I'd go again, easy.</review>

My experience there was fun. Not the most updated facility, but for what it was, it was good. The staff was somewhat hesitant on assisting us on any concerns, but 15 dollars for the whole day on a Tuesday. It didn't bother me much.< /text>

Generally speaking the staff here are very pleasant and helpful. It was fun for two adults to do the car racing at the miniature golf and even had fun playing laser tag. You don't have to be a kid to go here.<//Review>

<Text>If I could cuss on here I would. This place was junk right from the start. Over an hour in line for the go karts. The kids running it were the f word lame. Don't waste your money or time.

If you like stupid people with stupid attitudes and lousy service, you can come here all day long. As for me I'm going to boomers because they know what's up. Great service and great atmosphere. Go there instead.</Text>< UserId.>

Came here with a pretty large group (~15 ppl). For the price, you can have a lot of fun here. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours max, though. When you pay for the day, you get mini golf, Lazer tag, gokarts and more all unlimited. There is also an arcade to win tickets or just for fun. There is also food, a little over priced, but it is food. There are also just open tables for parents/chaperones to wait while kids are off doing their own things.<//Review>

I know they power down the cars, but maybe a brake button. on the final lap.  The single x double xx is a badge of honor for these people.  The all day pass is the way to go.

I like this place but after going to many times it can get boring. There not much a variety to offer. Parties are hella expensive. The arcade games I'm hearing cost a lot and its the same ole same ole. This place need more variety or something.<//Text>

I had a horrible experience here. Besides the mediocre facilities, the staff proved to be dishonest and not focused on customer service. My iPhone fell out of my pocket during a round of laser tag. I was able to track it still at the facility an hour after closing. The next morning, however, I could no longer track my phone because it had been turned off. I went to look for it before opening. I practically had to force the manager to let me look. He obviously tried to brush me off as best he could. When it wasn&#39;t there he said they&#39;d &#39;keep an eye out for it&#39;. I later tracked the phone in a mobile home park. It had clearly been stolen by an employee before opening. The manager didn&#39;t seem to care when I spoke to him on the phone and again gave me the brush off.
<br/>
<br/>You obviously can&#39;t trust their staff. Don&#39;t bother.< /review>

Brought my family here for my son's 11th birthday. Had an awesome time. First time here. (we aren't from around here.) Prices were great, food was yummy. :) We had one minor incident, but it was handled with urgency and affirmative action.

-When you turn 18, you are no longer considered a child! My kindergarten age child knows that no matter what "we keep our hands and feet to ourselves." Therefore placing your hands on another person's child will have you removed from anymore children you may be capable of harming. Geez, some people! If children "annoy" you, you might want to look else where for entertainment! A big THANK YOU to Tony, for acting fast and accordingly.< /Text>

All this place needs is roller coasters and this place could be an amusement park with amusement park prices. It costs two bucks to play Jurassic park that's insane even a bag of skittles is two bucks ridiculous!?  I'd take my kid anywhere she wants to go but dang!!, I'll be broke real quick. Miniature golf at this location is repetitive and not much of a challenge for the little ones.</review>

<Text>I used to take my kids here but now it's so over priced we only go for batting cages.  The video games are expensive and for Lazer tag 8 bucks a turn rediculous.  And then the wrist band deals are only on weekends so don't even bother to go during week. Then the wrist bands are the price of an amusement park admission.  They would make more money if it was cheaper by volume more people would come and in turn more revenue.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dd4a820920bddd:0xf7f93c345c295141</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I enjoyed the Go-Karts and Laser tag and would go there for their $12 tuesday special which they discontinued. They are fun but no longer have reasonable deals and prices. I'm sad to say that it is becoming overpriced with  long lines.<//review>

Great place for a 'Family Fun Day Sunday"
The kids loved the go carts, climbing the wall, and the batting cages. Clean & safe environment.....the pizza is mediocre, but over all, a very fun day!< /text>

<Review>The carbon monoxide spewing out of the Miniature go carts is making a lot of people sick just waiting in line for the electric go cart and you can smell the carbon monoxide for a long time even while you're miniature golfing near the entrance you can smell the carbon monoxide spewing out of those miniature go carts, I feel sorry for the little kids driving those things.

Good place for kids and youth to play.  If they stay away from the indoor arcade, they can get pretty healthy physical activities outside by doing rock climbing, golfing, and go-cart</text>

This place is good for the miniature golf and the go carts, but the video games inside are way over priced. It was such a let down when they raised the prices of their arcade games. Bad move!<//Text>

<text>The miniature golf was not very technical, most holes were just strait or one bank shots. The corse was poorly light for night, and the clubs and turf were in bad shape. Also tried out the go carts on the speedway they are way to slow not fast enough to pass anyone. There were also 6 or 7 kids under ten just running around unsupervised causing a havoc on the mini golf running from hole to hole with not regards to who was already playing on the hole. They need to enforce the supervision rule...< /text>< Pics>

Teenagers running the park used strong profanity between each other and could be heard by all. Oblivious to the many little children around, vocabulary and topics overheard were not family oriented.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It is small, but you can play well. If you put $100 on your card, you can spend $175, and you can enjoy everything with a day pass of about $40 per person.
