Great place to get dental work done. All the staff at Imperial dental are great! The weekend appointments for ortho are great. All the doctors that I have encountered here are very caring, patient.< /text>

They are so Professional. They have always been super careful with hygiene and now with covid, even more so. They go over the pricing prior to all work and the Dentists are the Top of the Line.
Besides giving them two thumbs up and 5 stars, they are always efficient with their use of time and equipment. They have more than one Doctor, Assistant, Receptionist and more. They make me proud to refer them to not only family and friends, but to anyone that I don't even know.<//review>

<text>Attempted to move my son to another office after I was not seeing any progress over a year of going to this place. They canceled my contract but charged me 75% over 3 grand for doing practically nothing. I reached out to thier facility manager JEN FLORES and she the rudest person on the face of the earth. Tries to be nice till you call her out for her facility being out right thieves. Attempted to refund me a little bit in return to remove my review, but no thank you, people need to know this place sucks. They are overpriced and management out to drain you dry. NEVER GO HERE.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I went here last year to get my son braces off advise that this office was good and had competitive pricing. Come to find out they are overpriced as my other son we took him to bright now dental and was a thousand  dollars cheaper. They front desk is rude and does not return phone calls. I would never recommend this location. On the other hand I just took my son to thier Corona location and has the same orthodontist and they are amazing there. I tried to transfer him but Yuciapa location saying I have to pay my balance in full to them to transfer, even though it is the same company. NEVER GO TO YUCIAPA IMPERIAL DENTAL, such a headache, overpriced, front office workers are all rude, the lady that gives you the qoutes rips you off. Go to the Corona location if you want to get treated like a person and not a piggy bank getting squeezed for every cent.< /review>< gmap_id>

<text>I don't have enough bad things to say about this place. Went 3 times and it's like an assembly line. The dentist will do about 15 minutes of work, make you wait about 45 minutes while he does the same with other patients, then rinse and repeat, figuratively and literally. Last time I went I walked out after sitting in the chair for an hour and a half. Not only that, but the work I did get I'm still getting fixed by another dentist. And the small amount of work ended up costing me $3500, after insurance. So many better and cheaper options in the same area.</text>< pics>

1 thousand dollars to pull out a bad tooth is a ridiculous price. Went to the LLM dental school and they took it out for $200. Plus gave me a plan for replacement and drugs. Check all your options before you let this dental practice look in your mouth. Extremely over priced.< /text>

Great staff!! Friendly and helpful in explaining procedures. Zully is fun to talk with and strives to get to know her patients on a more personal level.  Her positive attitude and prompt "lets down to business" when it's time to work makes me feel confident in her care. Thank you ladies for taking great care of my husband.</Review>

Fair warning DO NOT GO HERE! !!!

Wait until the BBB and local authorities see the pain and suffering this office is causing to my family and others!

Don’t think this review is because we are upset. This review is to let the public know of the cheating staff and manipulates that take advantage of the elderly.

You know that if someone is on fixed income why would you increase your rates and sell them something they don’t need?

Unfortunately services are rendered so you can’t refund the money for teeth cleaning that costs 1/3 anywhere else! We could have gone to Beverly Hills where the Rich go and still oh less money! I’m so fed up with hearing about so many people getting ripped off here I had to say something.

So my fellow reviewers this office is not clean, they lie about there services and take advantage of the elderly. So if you have any care in the world for yourself or family stay away. Or if you just don’t care then come get ripped off. I’d say if you have money to burn donate to the less fortunate not to scammers like Dr. Chow and his office!< /review>< Pics>

I did not know that a visit to a dentist could be so enjoyable.  They stuck with me throughout all my developing needs, and were always considerate of my feelings, comfort level, etc..  No one really likes going through dental work, but they were considerate, helpful and encouraging.  I haven't finished my work, but at least I can look forward to professionals.</text>

Wow. This place is great. Everyone was so nice. I have not been to a dentist in almost 4 years. It wasn’t until I broke a tooth and the crown fell off that I was in enough pain to make me go again.

I was absolutely floored. Dr. Rolle  and Cherina were amazing. He was so calm and relaxing that it really helped me to relax. The drill work was quick and I cannot believe how easy it was to get all of the work done and crown delivered in less than three hours.

Dr. Rolle and cherina, you are stuck with me. I am excited to actually have a new dentist and have even planned some additional work.< /review>

Dr. Sylvers was kind, gentle, and thorough. She took the time to get to know me and explain everything that was happening. I felt very comfortable, which is a word I have never used to describe a visit to the dentist. 100% recommend.< /text>

I went in for a check up and a cleaning. Wasted 3 1/2 hours waiting. Only to be told I need $3000 in dental work. 2 caps and a deep cleaning?
Then to be told they couldn't do the cleaning anyway because the cleaner went home already for the day!!!!!
I had to sit for 3 hours to be told that?
Waste of time. I will not go back.
*Follow up*
I went to another dentist. I was told that imperial dental lied to me. I did not need 2 caps. Did not need a deep cleaning. Or $3000 worth of work.
I was told that imperial dental will exaggerate the exams in order to make $$$.
Called the California dental association to file a complaint. However it turns out they are not a member of the California dental association.
So my advice is to stay away. Beware.<//Text>

Never ever going back! The staff was nice, but the work wasn't good quality work that was done on my teeth. I was given a quote at first,  and then my tooth was worked on, and as the dentist worked on it, my tooth broke in half, and then, he said I had to pay more. It was his mistake,  but,  I couldn't go home with a broken tooth, so I had to agree  to their terms and get it fixed. We paid well over 1500.00. And by the way the crown that was put on, fell off now. Not good. So, now I'm praying and looking to find a good, quality,low cost dentist. I do not reccomend them.<//review>

Everyone was pleasant to deal with, but I got tired of the constant attempts to sell you on extra services, and trying to get you to finance the extra recommended services, even after you have said "No thank you". It was far too frustrating to me, so my family is moving on to a different dental office, hopefully it will be a better experience.< /Text>

Front staff, they've earned 5 🌟 from me, they're always very friendly 🙂.  As for the Dentist, he's more of a salesman than a dentist.  Every time I visit he  pushes to sell me various extra treatment's that costs thousands of $$.  As though I can just grow more 💵. He gets a 2.</text>

<Text>Normally I find dental exams very stressful and had avoided one for several years. My first visit today was wonderful! I was greeted by a very cheerful, professional front office team. My xray tech, dental hygienists Jamie and Sade, my dentist Dr. Pang all treated me with respect and concern. Jamie, thank you for sitting with me calming my nerves. Sade, you're my hero. This was the first time anyone has worked on my teeth and I felt no pain. Dr. Pang, thank you for your gentle honesty. I know my teeth need a great deal of help. You confirmed that but also offered treatment options which provide both assurance and hope. Everyone's treatment of me was respectful and without judgment (did I mention I hadn't been to a dentist in years). Thank you. I'm so happy to have found you all.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

< review>
I am going to give this practice one last chance to resolve the issues they have created with my teeth at this point my review would be extremely negative but I believe everybody has a terrible day where you are completely unprepared, over promise,and underachieve and everything goes south, the complication I am having with the poor material they used as caps fell like cheap rough chalk like substance.I hope I can revisit the site and give you a positive report, I'm Praying!!

Update: Within the last two years every single tooth they capped had to be replaced because of cheap materials and craftsmanship, my son also who had three teeth capped had to have each a everyone replaced. Each and every tooth tooth failed one after another. Thank God we found art dentistry in Yucaipa to replace all the damaged teeth that imperial dental did to our teeth. This been a long road and several thousands of dollars and loss of time and work also the inconvenience. My advice is to stay as far away from imperial dental as you can ! do not use their services<//review>

<text>The place is nice and initially I had a good feeling. They seemed personable and friendly. I was there for 6 hours just to have a tooth capped, and they charged me $1,100. The advertisement offered a cleaning, xray and consultation for $65. They came up with some excuse to not give me the cleaning. I wish I would have read the reviews and avoided this place all together and you should too. They have also been known to exaggerate the treatment needed only to get a bigger bill.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I've been going here since 2011, overall good experience. The sales tactics are getting old lately, always recommending those stupid deep cleanings.... they are completely unnecessary.

PS
oh and they're pricey<//Text>

I could not find any reviews of Dr. Tuan Hoang which made me nervous going into having four wisdom teeth extracted. That is why I am writing this review. Dr. Hoang was great! He answered my (many) questions, took care to make sure I was ready and healthy for the extraction, and eased my nerves before the procedure. His assistant and anasthesiolgist were WONDERFUL and helped reassure me and calm me down. Following my procedure I called Imperial  Dental for a follow up to have my teeth looked at (I’m a very paranoid individual when it comes to my teeth) and they worked me in with Dr. Chung. Dr. Chung was also wonderful and patient and answered all of my questions. Sometimes at the dentist you feel rushed, like you are just one more patient, however Dr. Chung really eased my worries and was very kind. Thank you Imperial Dental. Dr. Hoang and Dr. Chung are wonderful!<//review>

I finally said I just want the wisdom tooth removed. they scheduled me but never went over the details or anesthetic options or anything!! And that was the reason for my appointment in the first place!!The dentist didn't even come back in the room to give me something for the pain I was having. Every time I leave there feeling  overwhelmed and depressed. They make me feel like my mouth is a mess, needs all this work but I can't afford it.

In 2016 I took my daughter to this dental office they told me she needed 5 root canals and that it needed to be done asap. I didn't think my 10 year old needed that much work done on her mouth and I took her for a second opinion. She got an award at her new dentist for having no cavities! This made me wonder, has this happened before? I had 7 teeth pulled years ago at this dentist and I wonder if that was necessary? So I went and made an appointment and sure enough they wanted tok pull 2 more of my teeth after doing a root canal. I went to have a second opinion the next day and I only needed a fill and a cap. The porcelain tooth that Imperial Dental had put on years before was not put on correctly. I had the new dentist call for my daughter's records and they were told the records were lost, I called and was told the same. I brought this up with imperial and they told me different dentists diagnose differently. Well 5 root canals on a 10 year old with no cavities seems very different to me! I started to ask around and my mother had had a similar experience and now has a new dentist. I posted on FB and one story after another about insurance fraud and false diagnoses poured in. I don't know if what they are doing is illegal or just morally wrong but it needs to stop! Putting a child through that much pain and suffering for no reason?! Who would do that!? I am creating this group because I can't find another way of getting the information out there. Have you had a similar experience? Do you want to stop them from doing this to anyone else? Please join me, I need all of the help I can get!
Please check out my newly created group "Spreading the word about Imperial Dental yucaipa" I need your stories and your help. I've tried making posts on the Front Porch but was blocked. Please read my story and spread the word. They will have to stop if we make enough noise.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>One of the worst car wash experience for the money.

After checking the review on google, my wife and I took our cars here.. biggest mistake.

My car: Detailing wasn’t a detailing. Not only was it sub par.. The car was barely cleaned inside and out. Interior vacuuming was 80% done (had to call the guy twice to re vacuum) and the wheels weren’t even cleaned.. Couldn’t waste more time here..<//Review>< Pics>

I paid $ 90.00 for a car wash that includes wax and polish. Which would take 1 hour and a half, which didn't last 1/2 hour. I will not take the car again they robbed me because they did not do the job well</text>

Normally I love this place but they are not enforcing the mandated mask order for LA and putting customers and employees at risk. I will be contacting the health department to do a check on the location because it's not right. I went for an oil change and now I will have to self monitor to see if any symptoms arise. I am extremely sadly and scared by this situation! Management you need to do better!<//Text>

Great place to treat your vehicle to the attention it deserves. Have a seat inside and watch satellite TV or just relax and catch up on social media and the endless emails on your cellphone. Good place to have your car detailed while basking in the shade.</text>

<Text>I've been here twice. The first time was good. The second time I went to get my lights retouched since they give you a 1 year warranty on them. They didn't have anyone available for the service. I also asked if they had a package that would give me a deep interior cleaning...the rep offered a $40 special they had going. I went with it but I basically got a wax an armor all but not a deeper cleaning on the interior.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I had originally gave my visit a 5 star as I've always been happy till a week ago Friday.  Guy didn't dry the roof leaving soapy film on roof sides.. middle was fine as I assumed thatth with hit it with air. In reality I could care less.. its having my rear driver's side wheel scratched.. that really bothersome. I now have to pay some one close 150 to repair clear and scratch grooves ...< /Review>

<Review>Vitali, a Russian looking, short man claimed to be the owner. I pulled up and said I wanted the $13 package. He’s like “we’re not doing that price today.”  By the way, the prices are listed on the way in.  I was pretty upset because, it seemed he was just trying to make more money or something. I’m like “forget it, I’m out of here.” There are so many other car washes to choose from.  When a private company does business in our local towns and they can just out of the blue, claim that a small deal can’t be done on any given day, when the price is clearly listed, no one should do business with that company.  Trust me, we have a family legal private investigation business to and we can easily take advantage of the client by over charging services. Why deal with an old cranky man who wants to change prices on the time of a transaction?  My household has so many cars and I definitely won’t be bringing my business here anymore.</Review></record>

Came to get first time car wash and hand wax done for my new car. Decided to go with the offer they had of a $90 clay wax + vacuum + car wash. Car exterior looks great but inside was same/got dirtier on floor mat. I asked to vacuum my car trunk but seemed like nothing was done. WORSE thing was they messed up my car paint and also a DEEP scratch on my car door. Told this matter to front desk and a guy came to see my car. With all his might he denied everything and push the blame on ME and saying other people messed up my car instead before I came there. I paid $90 hoping to get a nice job well done but I received bad job and bad service instead. THEY EVEN FORGET THE AIR FRESHENER. What a regret. Not coming back here.<//review>

Got a free center console cleaning with each wash.  Great deal going on for $35 bucks you get a standard oil change next door and a supreme car wash.  Heck of a deal.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I came here to have the oil change.  The mechanical man met me and promised to have the brake check and car wash pkg #3 ($17.99) for free. I was then convinced by one of the lead wash man to pay $40 for a complete hand wax.
They did the oil change but no brake check.  I asked why.  The mechanic said no need because my brake didn't have any sound.  BS.

Then I wait 2 hours for the car wash and hand wax.  The wash is OK, quick, neither better nor worse than anywhere else.

The problem is the extra wax.  I waited outside and saw them not touching my car much,  did the bare minimum after 2 hours, virtually not much better than regular car wash.  When confronted with the bad job, with the bird drops still visible on the side, the con man blamed my car is old.  He told me to pay him extra $100 more to do the buffing if I want my car shining like new. I didn't want to argue with the guy, just take my key and left.

They just want your money and do the bare minimum on the wax, then trying to convince you to pay more for the bigger service of wax and buff.  I regret already pay first.  I should wait and verify the work before paying at the cashier. Lessons learned, and will never come back to meet dishonest people.

Aslo, no air conditioning inside the dirty waiting area. Don't go to this place< /Text>< pictures>

<text>So unsatisfied with this place...they upped the prices and tried to charge me an extra 5 dollars because of my mini suv...did I say mini??? Wth? Then the owner's daughter(or whatever she is) gave me additude because I complained about tge extra charge? I've been washing my same mini suv here for year's! Why the price change plus additude! Not cool. Plus the vacuuming was less the mediocre. Not happy.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Used to like this carwash, but the last time I visited, the manager was very rude.  I paid extra for a wax job, and when I noticed they didn't do it, I tried talking to the manager, but he was very rude, and lied about it.  He said they did it, and I told them I was watching my car all the time and knew they did not do the wax job.  Asked for my money back, and the manager said that he wasn't going to do it, and walked away.  Will never,  ever go here again.< /Text>

Exterior cleaned good, interior not as much - also don't like the fact that they played with my stereo, I turned it off BEFORE getting out of my car & when I left they not only turned it on but changed my programming.</Text>

The owner is a money hungry biggot who overcharges even the most loyalest customers.  They haven't increased their prices every year slowly but surely and now require a minimum of 15 dollars to use a card as a payment.  The most cheapest car wash is 14 dollars so they got you pegged to buy something I the store or go for the higher option.  I tried to tell the owner I would like 2 dollars for a tip so it should charge me so it would be 16 dollar charge which should put me over 15 dollars but he told me that the tip isn't his money so it doesn't count. I was confused and asked him if those were his employees outside washing cars in which I tipped and he looked at me with a stupid face and didn't answer.   DONT SUPPORT THIS MONEY HUNGRY OWNER!!!!  DONT COME HERE TO WASH YOUR CAR!< /Review>

< Review>
Amazing. I enjoy the shrimp coconut rolls, the pork rolls (don't know the actual name), and my go to is the red curry with chicken and extra veggies. My kids enjoy the fried rice and the prawn noodles. Don't forget to order dessert because it's soooo good!   The coconut jelly dessert (don't know the actual name) was great! Pricing is reasonable for a family and the quality of food is great!!<//Review>

Food was excellent. We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. Food was fresh and hot when we picked it up. I really appreciate that they use chicken breast, I'm personally not a fan of dark meat. Portions were good size and allowed for leftovers. Will definitely come here again.<//text>

Crave.this.food!!!! Ribeye roll! Eat it. Sizzling sole is soooo good and tender and mild but yet full of flavor. Shaky beef is a favorite. Vegetable Tom Yum is so satiating.< /review>

<Review>We LOVE Bamboo Bistro.  I picked up birthday dinner for Cheryl since we couldn't go out due to the lockdown, and of course it was fantastic.  Good portions.  Nice and hot.  EXTREMELY TASTY.  Definitely on of our favorite Go To places in Newport.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate><resp>None</resp></record>

<review>1.5 HOUR wait for online order. I ordered through their website, it did not mention a wait time, I called multiple times (they would not answer the phone). I received an email 30 minutes after ordering saying the order would be ready in an hour (total 1.5 hours). We are locals and have dined here many time, but Will NEVER return. An hour wait may be understandable, but it needs to be disclosed upfront, not 30 minutes after ordering, plus, I cannot call them to cancel my order. We are now scrambling to find something for dinner. I am so disappointed.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Do not order through delivery service. Go there in person only. They advertise 30 minutes, and I’m about ten minutes away from receiving my order I placed at 5:10pm.

It is a disservice to advertise incorrect delivery times. It hurts businesses who honestly post their delivery times.

I didn’t ask for a refund, I asked that the restaurant start being honest so we level the playing field for other establishments who can  handle the capacity.

Order was the beef noodle soup (good), side of vermicelli noodles and vegetable fried rice.</text>

<Review>The food is good but our to go order was wrong and for their prices they have to do better. Asking 2x to verify the order and be assured it was all accounted for. But drive home and bloop no lettuce for wraps and rice containers 20% full.<//Review>< date>

Amongst a sea of asian dining establishments, Bamboo Bistro serves up great Vietnamese options with a touch of class. Their recent expansion opened up additional seating optiok ns, but be prepared for a minor wait because this place is hoppin with loyal diners. Great curries, spicey noodles, and apps.< /review>

Any orders placed via Postmates the order has to be placed and paid for by the driver and WAIT which adds an incredible amount of time to the order which they don’t get paid for plus the staff there is incredibly rude. Just get in the car and go get it yourself if you don’t want to wait 2 hours<//Text>

< review>
I was really happy when I found out that the restaurant would be open near our house. This restaurant is related to Brodard Chateau which we love to introduce to our friends. However, we are disappointed that the food here is not as good as the one in Brodard Chateau even though they have the same menu. I ordered a vemicelli with BBQ pork and it came out not as fresh and the meat was really salty and chewy. My husband ordered his favorite Clay pot rice and it turned out bad too. As a Vietnamese, I can tell that the food here is not something to crave for. If you want to have better food quality, I'd recommend the original Garden Grove branch.< /review>

Shrimp spring rolls. Chicken lettuce wraps. Pad thai and more - its all incredible here! This place is famous for a reason, they are incredibly consistent in what they do, these guys don’t have “bad days” like other restaurants. The food and service are perfect every single time, if you want a no-chance-at-failure experience, definitely come by. Take out or dine in, its all worth it!< /Review>

Moderately priced but hey Corona Del Mar leases I'm sure. Still prices were very reasonable. Had a friend that did deliveries locally and she noticed this location was popular. We went to have a slightly later lunch there for fun. Wow! Were we pleasantly surprised. This is Viet Cafe/Grill style, not a Pho house. Although they have some Pho style soup selections. For a later lunch around 2pm they had 80/90% covers filled so busy place for sit down service. Still the turn over for wait was very short. My friend had a lovely Thai Iced Tea, I had a house lager beer. We started with a simple beef satay. Nice marinade and the peanut sauce was delightful. Was pleased it wasn't chewy or over cooked. They had shrimp spring roll variety and crab (?) egg roll (?) also. The specials looked very tasty too, I recommend checking them. For entre, she had chicken/shrimp pad thai, they let her combo the proteins. Flavors were spot on for the Pad Thai. I had their specialty Shaken Beef. I've had it once before in Garden Grove. Basically trimmed fillet mignon, done with garlic, mushrooms and bell peppers. Similar to a Chinese pepper beef Szechuan style. However, the meat is cubed and better quality for Shaken Beef. I'd say the sauce is more rich too, very beefy and tangy dark sauce. Portions were spot on. For service they were busy but helpful. No reservation, walk-in. I liked the darker ambiance inside (posted pics). The macaroons and champagne in the front case looked like a tasty desert for a fancy occasion. Interesting the his/hers restroom is outside and common to the business center. Just ask for the key at the front central desk. To find I suggest be northbound on PCH, hard right turn just before the Chevron and before Mac Arthur. Restaurant is ahead on the corner on the right. Some street parking or more parking after a right turn in the neighborhood. Typical parking for the area is a bit tight, plan for a possible short walk. Don't park at Chevron, possible tow. Done with Thai food? Now go south on PCH, right at Goldenrod and follow to the beach for a pleasing sunset at the lookout. Ah, the charm of the crown of the sea. Good appetite fellow foodies :D< /text>

The beef curry was the best thing I did since writing that book on beef curries. This place has standout beef and extraordinary curry. The beef curry is perhaps the best reason to visit this place. Finally, if I had to choose... I'd say, "the beef curry at this place is unlike any other."</Review>

The customer service here is worse than at popeyes when they ran out of chicken sandwiches.  The food is good but extremely overpriced for a horrible wait staff and hostess experience. Not to mention how loud it gets in here.</Text>

<text>Amazing food and ambience. Feels boujee but the prices sure don't show it. Really great veggie broth for the pho, and a good review from my friend on the non-veg broth too. Excited to try more of the dishes here, definitely going to be my go to Vietnamese restaurant ❤️<//text>< Pictures>

<username>Brandon McCartney<//username><Date>1578845945248</Date><rating>4< /rating><text>Local 'hidden gem' go-to for good Pho. Casual family dinner or date spot. Solid Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Fresh and simple ingredients. Food for the healthy minded, but also plenty of savory options for the non diet restricted.

Pros: food

Cons: service can be hit or miss.

Pro tip: for some extra spice... make sure you have the chilli sauce jar (small wood jar, little spoon, with clear top) brought to your table if one isn't there already.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Delicious food, great people, and best of all you can feel the family feel good atmosphere when you step inside the building. Best hidden jewel within Corona Del Mar. It will hold a special place within your heart.</Review>

We stopped here during the week for a quick lunch They had us in and out and well under an hour we had plenty of time to get back to the office.  There food whether you order out and have it delivered or go to the restaurant It's absolutely fantastic.  to be honest I can't pick a favorite item off of their menu It's all delicious.</Review>

< Review>
I don’t understand all these great reviews here. Maybe we were just extremely unlucky, but our experience was not even a mediocre one. We got placed on the 2nd floor, unfortunately next to very loud groups that had no filter. However, we had chicken dumplings that were presented very poorly and didn’t taste at all. My main dish - garlic noodles with beef - was most likely the worst Asian dish that I ever had (besides a chicken soup in Macao...). Arrangement bad, no taste, the whole thing looked like Spaghetti tossed in Thai curry sauce and tons of mushrooms and asparagus mixed in it. My wife’s wonton soup was fishy and not tasty as well. The waitress that took the order never showed up again, and we had to ask for the check at the end, and the plates etc were never cleared. Not to mention that anybody had asked how we had liked our meal. overall, I cannot recommend this place I am afraid.</Review>

The food was very good and the staff were professional and friendly.  The wait time for the food seemed a little bit long, but overall I was satisfied with my experience. Delicious Thai Ice tea.</review>

<text>This restaurant seems to be both a Thai restaurant and a Vietnamese restaurant, and excels at neither. I had the seafood fried rice, which was bland, and the others in my party had the green chicken curry, which was underwhelming. I enjoyed the tea boba.<//text>< Pictures>

I really do enjoy this location. It's east to just hop off the PCH and get dinner to go, or to sit out on their patio on a nice day and appreciate the day while you enjoy your meal. Their menu is fantastic and they are a friendly staff with great service. I recommend eating here whether your by yourself, on a date, or taking your family to dinner. The menu is accommodating to everyone.</review>

Called in a to-go order.  Food was ready on time, order was correct and food was delicious - the steamed shrimp rolls, the summer rolls, the veggie fried rice and the zucchini noodles with tofu.  Highly recommend it!<//text>

The Phuket noodle soup is the most mouth watering and flavorful seafood dish I have ever tried in my life.  Every time I come here, that is what I get.  There is no seafood soup as tantalizing as this.  The positives are that there is extensive parking in the street and around the restaurant, and this serves an amazing pan-Asian food.

The other negative is that the restroom is outside of the restaurant.  You actually have to walk around to get to it on the outside.  Also, unless you get reservations at night, you have to wait.  All in all, this is a fabulous gem of a place to dine out.  The prices may be a little higher than usual for Asian cuisines, but we are talking about Corona Del Mar in the nicest part of Newport Beach.< /text>

Tasty. We had to wait a while even though we had a reservation, but the food was good and the service was good. It is too packed in with tables just like most of Southern California, but we will go again. Never again on Friday or Saturday.</review>

< review>
Excellent Thai/Vietnamese cuisine! Fried rices are outstanding, noodle dishes as well. Their crispy spring rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf are amazing. The Tom Kha (coconut) soup is very good. This is the first thing I have at Thai places, it usually gives a good idea of the quality. My recent favourite that I go back for every week is on the special of the month menu (3 months in a row luckily!), shrimp, crab and asparagus stir fried with egg. I am addicted to it! The place is small, I'm surprised they haven't tried moving into a bigger space, they are always full and very popular for take out.<//review>

Stopped here while in the area for some dinner. We were promptly seated even at around 6pm on a Friday. The restaurant was fairly crowded though. Cost relative to the quality and quantity was good.< /Text>

The spring rolls and garlic noodles are delicious. The Chicken Pho and Beef Pho were very good and can be seasoned to taste. The desserts, mangos and sticky rice, strawberry crepe were a perfect ending to a great meal.< /review>

Most Vietnamese restaurants I've visited are a little too strip mall for me. I don't know why that is, but it detracts from the experience for me. Not Bamboo Bistro...nice location and, much more to the point, great food. The Phu and Pad Thai in particular. High marks are well deserved.<//Review>

Great food :) definitely a restaurant that I will keep going back to. 👍👍👍 the only little drawback is that the restroom is outside down the sidewalk up in an ally on your right side. Needs a key to get there. Otherwise the restaurant is fantastic and always full.< /text>

Every time ive gone here the food had been nothing but amazing. However, the time a date and I had to sit there for over two hours even though we devoured our items in less than twenty minutes. Employ beverages and our dessert order took close to forty minutes alone.<//Text>

<Text>Great spot for lunch! Although it's also open for dinner, they're lunch specials make it a bargain. It can be pricier for lunch. Their soups and rolls are the best! Avoid 12-1pm as that's the most crowded because of the employees who work in the area on their lunch break.<//Text><Response>None</Response><UserId.>103397938311856752610<//UserId.><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

The best and most likely the only Vietnamese restaurant in Newport. The ground beef, chicken, and seafood egg rolls are a must try.

Parking is in the back. Few seating in restaurant. Restroom is a pain to get to and located outside.</Review>

One of the best spring rolls ever! The pho however was just ok, but everything else was great for me. It can get quit packed in this small place, but always a good choice.</Text>

Best Thai place in Newport Beach. The restaurant can probably seat around 50 but it does get quite crowded. The food is very good and service is prompt after you get seated. The curry with rice, pad thai, pad see ew, and pho are pretty good. I recommend the red curry with brown rice, very very good. Parking is street only so it's a bit tricky, but go to the back neighborhood and you'll find something.</Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>I’ve had lunch here several times and done take out and have found it to be pretty consistent. My favorite is their vermicelli noodles with the BBQ pork and eggroll. I’ve found it to be reasonably priced, especially for the area. We’ve also ordered the spring rolls, not sure how they compare to Brodard’s since I haven’t been there yet. The only down side is that parking can be a hassle.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

I've been here a few times but on my last experience I had to wait about 30 minutes for a table after calling in and then telling me you'd only be 5 minutes. I then ordered food with my date and then they took another two hours to serve me. The food was all right of course but I felt extremely neglected and almost felt as if is staff was talking poorly about me on top of the bad service.</text>

<Text>I won't lie to you guys. We went on a miniature adventure trying to locate this wonderful place. Can't decide if it's because we are special, or because this place is in such a tactical location that not even the hide and seek world champ of 2027 could find it. Anyways enough of that. Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns. Woops. Those are lyrics to Mulan. Sorry.

Seriously though. This place is delicious and I would highly recommend it to any noodle loving food connoisseur. Upon arriving at this little eatery on the corner, directly across from a conveniently located gas station for all your late night needs, we were greeted by friendly staff eager to serve their customers. Not even thirty seconds had passed and we were already being asked where we would like to sit and being directed to a table. Before you could even get comfy in your chairs we were already being asked what we would like to drink, not that this is a bad thing because I'm a thirsty guy. But wait, there's more. "Would you like ice with your waters?"  You're damn right I'd love to put frozen water in my liquid water to make it a bit colder on an already cold and rainy night.

I had never been asked before if I would like ice in my water. Most restaurants assume it's something you want, but I was very pleased that they would even ask. Definitely brownie points. A little later into visit, after starting at their mouth watering menu for a solid twenty minutes me and my companion, who is very cute by the way, ordered the Chicken Pad Thai for herself and I ordered the Beef Pho Bowl, or Pho Bo for short. The wait wasn't too bad, about 10 minutes. Plus I'm a firm believer in hunger is the best seasoning. When the food came out and arrived at our table, I took one whiff of my dish and immediately went to a noodley heaven. I transcended through noodle space and time and found myself in a bathhouse. Except the water was not water. It was a rich and tasty beef broth that was capable of bringing even the toughest man to his knees, and a tear to his eye. Not unlike cherry pie by Warrant.

I felt like I was in a 5 gum commercial. Every seasoning was so pronounced. I could literally taste each flavor dancing on my tongue. At one point there was the macareina, and halfway through the bowl they changed it up and we're doing the tango. All while this was going on, I was slowly being wrapped up in a noodle blanket covering me from head to toe. I could die a happy man. The warm noodles radiating heat throughout my body. I could do the Polar Plunge naked up in Big Bear and not even flinch at the sheering icy winds or freezing water. Which I actually did earlier last week. My feet almost fell off it was so cold. But not today, because I was protected by a coat of hot noodles.

The Chicken Pad Thai was also very delicious. I had a couple of bites. Unfortunately not enough to transcend noodle space and time once more, but I would highly recommend the dish. Enough so that on a second visit it would be a strong contender for my next dish.

We also had the Singha beer which was surprisingly good. It was a lighter beer with a nice aftertaste. Complimented our dishes quite well. We originally wanted the Lucky Buddha, but unfortunately it was out. Guess I'm not getting lucky tonight :/

A brief description of the interior now. Picture this, you're on a train going through the desert. Nothing but sand for miles and miles in every direction as far as the eye can see, which largely depends on your sight. You may need contacts. Anyways that desert scene is exactly what this place isn't. This joint is very quaint and cozy, in the best way possible. If I had to guess you could have about 40 people eating here max. But it works perfectly. Bamboo accent all around the walls, nice wooded flooring and tables. Felt like home. If home was a delicious Vietnamese Fine Dining establishment. Anyways I would highly recommend this place. It would have got a 5/5 stars but the bathrooms are a mission to find.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Just over a week ago, my now husband and I hosted a wedding rehearsal and welcome dinner in Bamboo Bistro's private dining room upstairs from the main restaurant for about 50 guests. The owner Chau and her team worked so hard to make sure that all the guests were attended to and felt welcome, and ensured that there was WAY more food to go around. :) (my parents and relatives happily took what seemed like endless leftovers back to the hotel for the next day's breakfast and lunch). We're so grateful that we found this restaurant; everyone kept talking about how amazing the food, service, ambience and space was, and the quality of the wine. I can't even count how many people raved about the food and how fresh and tasty it was; we even had some people who had never tasted Vietnamese food come, but quickly became converts! We had many guests come from overseas, and now that they are back home, they still can't stop raving about the welcome dinner here!!

We knew we wanted something Vietnamese for our welcome dinner since there would be no Vietnamese food unfortunately at our wedding reception the day after, and we wanted it to be within 30 min. driving distance of San Clemente, where our wedding was. Westminster and Garden Grove, where most of the great Vietnamese restaurants are, would be way too far away, and we just happened to come across this place since it's a sister restaurant of Brodard Chateau.

The restaurant offers a number of multi-course banquet style menus, and all are incredible value for both the quantity and quality of the food. In fact, I think we chose the second cheapest option, but you'd never guess this based on the variety of dishes and proteins and how good the food was! The most popular dishes by far that were served were the seafood claypot, the shaking beef with garlic noodles, and the mango sticky rice. The tastes are authentic but with modern twists, which even pleased my Vietnamese mother, who is extremely skeptical of anything that is "modern" and not exactly like what she grew up eating in Vietnam. Setting up the private dinner arrangements and a few customizations was so smooth and seamless; Chau was quick to respond via email and incredibly apologetic (unnecessarily so) when she responded even just a day or two later).

The private dining room space is really beautiful - modern, but with lots of traditional Vietnamese touches and paintings/decorations. It felt so comfortable, cozy, and refined without trying too hard. It's like a bigger version of the main restaurant downstairs.

The service was super attentive and someone was always quick to come to my side whenever I needed even the slightest thing. I am really in love with Bamboo Bistro, the owner Chau, their menu and entire staff, and my husband and I are so grateful to have found them and had our welcome dinner there. When we are back in the area, we'd happily come back to eat here again and would recommend it without reservation for any meal or private dinner party.</text>< date>

Worse place to order To-go!! Called in place my order and was told 30-45 min, arrived to the store within the time frame, and the I was told it will take another 30 minutes because they were busy, employees were very rude and did not seem to care, not coming back for sure.

Ps.- they advertise themselves as a Vietnamese restaurant, but while I was waiting everyone seemed to like more the Thai side....< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>(Translated by Google) Really delicious house
Noodles are delicious, steak salad, fresh vegetables and meat sauce
Best restaurant I've been to in a few days
Service managed
I need to come back

(Original)
정말 맛있는집
국수도 맛있고 스테이크 샐러드도 야채가 신선하고 고기양념도 잘 어우러진 최고의 맛
요 몇일사이 다녀본 맛집중 최고
서비스는 그럭저럭
다시 와야겠다< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dce0f4bc7b1e1d:0xf628b21f583cec7f</gmap_id></record>

This was the best Khmer food I've had since being in country. Authentic, delicious dishes displayed with flair and in an appropriately Cambodian environment. The staff was friendly and helpful, the menu was extensive, and the experience was unforgettable. Their សម្លម្ជូរគ្រឿង was astounding. Overall a solid A+, would highly recommend.<//Review>

<username>Rikio Inouye< /username><review>Moronom has delicious (and reasonable!) food and great service.  We ordered lemongrass chicken, bbq pork lunch, roast duck lunch, vegetable curry soup, and papaya salad.  Flavors were expertly balanced with spicier options available on many dishes (which we enjoyed).  We left full and with lots of leftovers! Owner Tony was gracious and accommodating making for an even better experience.  Will be returning soon!<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dd31739abd607b:0xc7cefb4792857570</Gmap_id><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzsveD7spF9apTp1SdeW7IDo-99H5TugVzn3ll=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtaFxY9Mj_Q6l5YBoD2rRWOOPn5xVdLOI1FmpX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvyqS5BlLJcORvkdjjaFDkfE7v07ej3foc2weL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>Monorom Cambodian Restaurant in Long Beach, California is a small intimate restaurant that's dishing out big flavor. They have an extensive menu that's bound to satisfy the taste buds of everyone in the family. The restaurant is located at the corner of Anaheim Street and Dawson Avenue at 2150 E Anaheim St, Long Beach, CA 90804. The shop is open 7 days a week from 9:00 am-8:30 pm. Indoor dining is still restricted but they do have outdoor dining in front of the restaurant. I visited the restaurant on two different occasions and tried two different dishes. It was delicious.

LEMONGRASS CHICKEN (BAI MONN CHA KROEUNG)  KROEUNG, a Cambodian distinctive and complex spice blend paste with a strong aroma of lemongrass. Stir-fried chicken with bell pepper, jalapeno, and onion.  $9.95 It was very flavorful and delicious.

Located in what is labeled "Cambodiatown" in Long Beach, CA, Monorom is a modest-looking shopping mall restaurant with really fine cuisine. The menu is quite varied, with vegetarian, seafood, beef, pork and chicken dishes of a wide variety. The lemongrass beef dish was richly flavored and spicy; the stir-fried watercress, with fish sauce and plenty of garlic, was particularly fine.<//review>

My friend and I ordered the beef noodle soup and phnom penh noodles and both turned out wonderfully. Also treated ourselves to the water spinach / morning glory and that was great as well.

Be sure to CALL directly - the staff were super nice and the order took <15 mins to pick up from when I called.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dd31739abd607b:0xc7cefb4792857570<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Definitely wanted to come to one of the "high reviewed" Cambodian restaurants in Cambodia Town.

Affordable prices. Decent size plates. My favorite was the Salt & peppered shrimp. Yum. Our server was very nice too. Didn't catch her name though, sadly. I also regret not taking photos of all the decoration, as all Thai and Cambodian restaurants always has nice ones. Especially with Buddhism shrines & what not.

Only thing I didn't like was, the  restaurant was a bit too narrow. Was expecting a little bit of a bigger place, when viewing the photos, prior to coming here. If and when I do come back, I will definitely order that salt and pepper shrimp again!< /text><rating>4</rating></record></dataset><record>

CAMBODIA 🇰🇭
Eat the World LA review:
One of the best reasons to fly to Long Beach rather than LAX, other than the ease of entry and exit unknown at the latter, is the chance to pop into one of the area restaurants. After dropping off my mother at the end of a recent visit, and an obligatory walk on the beach, we settled into a Saturday lunch before noon and found ourselves amongst a busy dining room dominated with a big group of eight.

Senmonorom is the capital of the eastern Mondulkiri Province, which borders Vietnam and is home to the indigenous Pnong people. Other than the name, this seems to be the only connection with this part of Cambodia as the menu sticks to a Khmer hit list which is very popular with the community here in Long Beach.

After having the life-changing plate of lot cha at Phnom Penh Noodle Shack, a few blocks north on Cherry Avenue, it is very difficult to resist a plate of it at any Cambodian restaurant. While the version here may not have the same effects, lot cha ($7.50) with chicken still was easily finished and enjoyed. By the time the food came it was noon and that of course was good enough reason to enjoy a cold Angkor Beer. You can find a lot of reasons to relax in Long Beach, but good Cambodian food and drink is at the top of any list.< /Text>

Luckily, being in Long Beach, there are no shortages of them. Monorom is one of the best. It is small but there are beautiful photos and antiques to keep your attention. It is very authentic.

Located at a busy intersection amidst the large Cambodian community in Southern California, this restaurant is very trendy, well decorated and provides authentic Khmer food. The soups with fish sauce and served on a hot plate is classy. This is one of the finest Cambodian restaurant in Southern California. During my third visit I ordered barbecue beef with rice, it was indeed fantastic. The plate was adorned with colourful vegetables and perfectly decorated.</Text>

<review>I'm not someone who just "belly-aches"  for the sake of complaining . The reviews were good, the presentations, (pics), looked so appetizing!  That's why I chose this restaurant.  Sadly, I was  disappointed with my experience,  from begining to end.... Our order arrived. 20 minutes late. Food was cold, smaller portions,  than expected.  The appetizer that was beautifully  displayed, as a warm/hot dish, in the menu, ( beef tendon balls & crab toast), came as 4 small cold balls, & 3 imitation crab sticks, ( cut in half). Both dishes that. Included. 'Duck', were flavorful. ... However,   they were almost inedible,  due to the teeny. .weeny bones in them. Hopefully,   this was just an off day, or certain products were. ..unavailable. With Cov-19, changing everything,  I understand<//review>< Gmap_id>

We like a lot hanging out. Yesterday we went to this magnificent place which we didn’t know before. We had a beautiful time there with excellent food and a well-trained team and a distinguished  chef. We put this venue in our phone list  and we shall surely go again very soon.  Highly recommended.</Text>

<Review>The menu is quite varied, with vegetarian, seafood, beef, pork and chicken dishes of a wide variety. The lemongrass beef dish was richly flavored and spicy; the stir-fried watercress, with fish sauce and plenty of garlic, was particularly fine. The vegetarian egg roles were light and crisp, and the "student noodles" (similar to pad Thai but with a slightly different flavor) were a standout too. This is a superb restaurant, with sizable portions and absurdly low prices.< /Review>< Response>

Food is delicious! We enjoyed everything we ordered!
Beef sticks: Before these were even set down on our table, my tastebuds knew these would taste great from the fragrant charcoal smell! Flavor is on point. Sweet & savory.
Coconut palm sugar desserts: great price, especially for the quantity! Served warm. WAY BETTER than what we’ve had at a famous Thai dessert place. Def order if you want a light but filling dessert to share!
Papaya salad: refreshing and delicious! Not toooooo fishy. Def will order again!</review>< Rate>

We ordered two appetizers, and three entrées and were incredibly pleased with the taste and blown away by the affordable prices.<//text>< Pictures>

One of my favorite places to eat in Long Beach. I love the beef stew. I've probably had most of the menu and it's all pretty dang good.

The atmosphere is relaxed and family orientated. The service is friendly and prompt.</Text>

Located at a busy intersection amidst the large Cambodian community in Southern California, this restaurant is very trendy, well decorated and provides authentic Khmer food. The soups with fish sauce and served on a hot plate is classy. This is one of the finest Cambodian restaurant in Southern California. During my third visit I ordered barbecue beef with rice, it was indeed fantastic. The plate was adorned with colourful vegetables and perfectly decorated.<//Review>

I wanted to try this place for a while. Small restaurant in a small strip mall in a not so good area of Long Beach. The dishes I tried were commendable. The service was Asian standard. The beef sticks were tasty, served piping hot, and with a sweet glaze on them. The sour soup was pretty good, very similar to tom yum kum in Thai cuisine. Another curry dish was very tasty. Overall very good. Thumbs up.<//Review>

I don't know how to start with the review because things were just too great. The Cambodian food here was just phenomenal and very authentic plus, the service was as great as it could get in America or anywhere else I have ever been. The environment was very Cambodian like along with friendly smile from the server. I totally recommend this place for anyone who come and visit Long Beach, CA that are interested in trying new awesome foods. This is totally a place I am going to visit again.<//Text>

Stopped in for a meal before heading to the airport. The area seemed intimidating with all the businesses being focused to cater to the asian population, but the staff was awesome with helping us pick out dishes and the food was great. Recommend the lemongrass chicken.</Review>

The dishes were tasty, lots of flavor, herbs & spices, lots of garlic, even their dipping sauce came with a kick, and if this is not enough, try their hot pepper rack, yummy options for spicy lovers. The place is cozy, the wait staff is slow when there's are than 3 tables, but friendly, as expected for an Asian establishment, then again they serve authentic dishes. We would come again when in the area. All these were yummy:  Beef Noodle Soup Kuyteav Sach Goh (Beef Noodle Soup), Kuyteav Kohr Goh (Beef Stew Noodle Soup),  Phnom Penh Noodle Soup Kuyteav Phnom Penh (Phnom Penh Noodle Soup),  Thai Boat Kuyteav Thouk (Boat Noodle Soup), Pohr Vien M’poang (Crispy Chitterlings) – a La Carte, Sach Goh Lok Lak (Beef Lok Lak) – a La Carte,  Dumplings. Size regular is sufficient to fill you up.<//Review>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Great local restaurant for authentic Cambodian food. The portions aren't as large as to other Cambodian restaurants in the area, a tad more expensive, as well. For the bang for your buck eater, a negative. As for me, I don't mind.

I've only tried their rice dishes and soup noddles. Fried Rice with Seasoned Beef(Lok-Lac); Beef and Seafood fried rice, which are all delicious. As for noddles, I've had the Phnom Penh Noddles (beef, shrimp, grounded pork and fish meatballs with rice noodles). Very delicious, as it doesn't steer away from the traditional ingredients/style. Surprisingly, the Thai Boat Noddles is great as well. One of the best I've tasted in Long Beach.

Tip: When ordering any rice dish, ask the server for a bowl of soup on the side. It'll enhance the dish and make it more enjoyable!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>In this case you CAN judge a book by its cover; in which the cover is extremely great! Everything from start to finish is beautiful, the office atmosphere, upbeat designs, and quality tools/amenities. NOW the important stuff is all just as high end, the customer service is 5 star as well as the work completed by the hygienists and Doctor! You really feel confident in the knowledge of Doctor Eric Mee, he conveys professionalism but yet makes you feel a valued patient, AGAIN you really feel confident in what he does and recommends.

OVERALL, truly "what you see is what you get", in which you see quality, you get quality. From the office being luxurious itself to the EXCELLENT staff and Doctor. I HIGHLY recommend this Dentist, heck I feel as if I need to get dressed up to come to this office, it is that nice!< /review><Rate>5<//Rate><Response>None< /Response>< Name>

< Review>
What a wonderful experience I used to go to Orange tree dental on Brookside wasn't very happy with their service.. Normally a long wait even if you have an appointment scheduled that was not fun. With state street dental you get there they have plenty of chairs in the doctor is attending to you within the few minutes that the nurse or assistant indicates. Great look to the office very modern very clean.<//Review>

<text>Absolutely love this place. They are all so kind and accommodating and always give the best care! I also love that they give you what you need and don’t try to sell you on other procedures or products just to make a profit. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area looking for a great dentist!</text>< pics>

<text>My son had an accident at school, pushing his front tooth back. I called an emergency dentist and they 'couldn't fit him in". My husband went here to get cleared for his military duty and suggested we come here in the morning.
My son and I arrived a few minutes after opening and they were complete booked up today. After explaining what happened the receptionist went into the back and was told they will fit my son in this morning. They are taking care of him now and I am so unbelievably relived.
We just scheduled a cleaning and we will be back for all of our dental needs. The staff is wonderful and compassionate and the doctor is very down to earth and professional! I completely recommend State Street Dental and Dr Mee!
As an added plus, there is a TV on the ceiling to keep your mind busy!< /text><rate>5<//rate><name>Karen McKee<//name><Date>1524068579028</Date><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcaa0c4b3f9d89:0x9489404bf99a9d0b< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

Very clean, convenient, modern and good tech.  Quick and thorough clean, x-rays and did not over sell anything I didn't need...  First visit here after a move to Redlands.  Daughter also has been and thought very well of the practice as well.</Text>

Normally, it’s a dread going to the dentist’s office. However, it’s actually a pleasant experience when you visit Dr. Mee and the State Street Dental crew.

Emily was my hygienist and she took great care with the cleaning of my teeth.

I’ve been to State Street Dental 3 times and each time I’ve seen Stephanie, the GM. I always enjoy our interactions at the front counter. You can tell she runs a tight operation over there.

Dr. Mee is great! I like the fact that when I had a minor cavity, he told me it was no big deal. However, if it were his child, he would want to fill it. That made sense, so we filled it.

I’m sure there are cheaper dentists, but State Street Dental is worth it for the quality of craft and care you receive.

Thank you State Street Dental!</review>

<review>Aside from the cleanliness of the office and rooms, professionalism of the front and back staff, timely and concise text communication updates and appointment reminders, and non-pushy dental care, the thing I appreciate most about State Street Dental is how prompt they are in checking you in and getting you to your cleaning or procedure at the appointment time. Seems like an insignificant detail, but days are hectic enough to plan for, and being on time for all appointments is something you don’t need to worry about here.

Dr. Mee and his team are truly amazing. I have been under his care for over 7 years. I broke 3 teeth in an accident over the weekend. One of his team members, Stephanie, called me first thing on Monday morning and got me in within 24 hours to assess the damage and repair my teeth; thanks Stephanie. I live in Long Beach and drive over an hour to Redlands for Dr. Mee and his team. They are kind, helpful and go above and beyond. Thank you Dr. Mee<//text>

I always had trouble obtaining appointments and when I would call the office with questions or concerns, I was met with the feeling of being a burden or that my concerns are not important. Staff in the back office were always great and very friendly. Office was clean and well maintained. It’s really hard to trust someone with your dental experience and I never felt comfortable there due to the phone calls and frustrating encounters. That alone, drove me away even though the dentist, hygienist, and dental assistants were great.< /text>< Pics>

Staffs are very professional and handled with care. The place follows covid-19 guidelines to ensure the patients and staff are healthy. The visit was quick no unnecessary delays. Doctors and assistants were kind, explained and guided the procedures well. Definitely recommend this place for any dental related concerns.<//Review>

A professional, friendly staff, super clean environment and plenty of wait space to keep a good social distance from other patients. Dr Mee has a very gentle hand and kind demeanor.
They also communicate through texts to keep you updated on appointments, which is my go to communication tool. Thanks for the great service!</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I genuinely look forward to getting my teeth cleaned here! The office staff is super friendly and they make it a positive experience. I’m not sure if it’s intentional, but I’ve had the same hygienist for each visit and she’s great. I never feel rushed and my teeth are squeaky clean!

Prior to becoming a patient at State Street Dental, I had brought up a recurring issue with my permanent retainer that never seemed to be fully resolved. When I moved to this provider, Dr. Mee not only addressed the issue, but provided a long term solution that has held up!

Also important to note - the staff are doing well with enforcing COVID precautions and communicating clearly about what they expect from patients (eg text upon arrival, wait in car until your turn, temp taken, etc). It’s comforting as a patient to know they carefully review each patient before they can enter the building.

And not related to the quality of care, per say, but the office almost has a spa feeling...Someone did a fabulous job on the design aesthetic!</text>< Pics>

I used to be afraid of going to the dentist. I grew up in a big family and we did not go very often. Eric is my son and I have to truthfully tell you that he is so gentle. I am no longer afraid of going to the dentist. I promise you will love him almost as much as I do. 😁</review>

< Review>
State street dental is very well presented. They have plenty of workers and the process was quick. The appointment seemed very transaction for going for the first time ever. You figured they would get to know you more and ask more about you. I usually get nervous on my first time being at a new office of any type of doctor. The dr seemed nice and gave me good news but then left. I am sure he was busy. He did ask why I started coming to him. He was very pleasant to talk with.

Great experience overall but felt too transactional for being there for the first time.<//Review>

<review>Updated Review:

This pandemic is hard on everyone. I know I need to grant others grace when needed. Lord knows there are many times where I need it and appreciate it when given to me.

Dr. Mee called me today to address the issues I was concerned about during my last visit. He was really kind and apologetic. It shows that he really cares about his patient’s experience. I know other business owners who attack people who negatively review their business. This was not the case. He ensured that the reuse of a cavi wipe is not the common practice and that it was addressed. Also, it’s been noted that I have a sensitivity to the epinephrine that’s in the lidocaine. I actually downplayed the reaction because I was trying not to full on panic while in the dental chair, so there was no way for Dr. Mee to know the severity of my reaction.

All in all, my last visit may have been an isolated incident, and it’s worth a third visit. I have kept my April visit and I have faith that it’ll live up to the standards that have given this dental office their good reviews.

As with all reviews, each experience is different and the only real way to know, is to check it out for yourself.

Previous Review:
This was my second visit here. The first issue is that the girl at the front taking temperatures was reusing the same Cavi wipe to clean the thermometer between each use. First of all, that is never ok. Cross-contamination is always a concern. But especially now, in this pandemic that has taken so many lives, we all should be more vigilant to not cross-contaminate.

Secondly, I don’t know if Dr. Mee was really busy or maybe just not having a good day, but he just didn’t seem personable during this visit. Also, it’s the first time I’ve ever had a reaction to the lidocaine in all the years that I’ve been going to the dentist. To me, it was a really bad reaction: my heart was pounding, I was hot, and I felt like I was going to pass out. I was told it would pass in 5-10 minutes. It was very traumatizing.

Really not a good second visit. I have a cleaning scheduled in April, but I’m going to cancel. It’s great that many have had good experiences here, but I will be moving on.</review>< Pics>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcaa0c4b3f9d89:0x9489404bf99a9d0b</Gmap_id><review>Today was my first appointment at State Street Dental. I received a text requesting to respond to the text once parked. I did so and received a prompt response to come in. Once I got to the front door, my temperature was checked and I was asked to fill out paperwork outside where they placed two chairs 6 feet apart. This place has covid measures on point! After I submitted my paperwork I was asked to wait inside in the lobby. I only waited 5 minutes or less and I was greeted by my dental hygienist Kevin. I love girls with guys names. She was really nice and explained everything well. A lot midway to the end of my cleaning, Dr. Mee arrived and introduced himself. He looked at my x-rays and discussed areas of concern. He was kind and explained everything well. Kevin finished my cleaning and gave my my dental goodie bag. I scheduled my next cleaning and also scheduled my husband for his leaning and check up.

The decor of this dental office is so nice! Had a great first experience and exited to make this our new dentist. Thank you Dr. Mee, Kevin, and the rest of the staff for an excellent visit. Give them a try! You won’t be disappointed.<//review>< Date>

This dental office has changed the way I think about dental offices. Their check-in process was streamlined, reception was quick and pleasant, the office was posh and relaxing, and we were seen right on time and left with goodie bags. The staff - receptionists, hygienists and dentist - took great care with us. Basically, everyone I encountered there was really good at their jobs. We're going to look forward to our dental appointments from now on.<//text>

The staff and the doctor are wonderful. They truly care about the service that they provide and the consumers they serve.  Everything is done with the people receiving dental services in mind. They have a wonderful coffee and tea area in their beautiful waiting room. When lying back in the dental chair, they provide you with a remote control so that you can watch the television on the ceiling. Their equipment is top notch.  I recommend them to anyone needing dental services.< /Review>

This place was great! I have nothing bad to say about State Street Dental. I went to a previous dentist and they told me I had bad periodontal disease. They recommended that I clean it up myself and come back every 3-4 months to get a deep cleaning/check up. In addition they said it was going to cost $1,500+ to fix a small chip in my filling!

I went to State Street and had a second opinion, they were very open and receptive to me coming in for that. After review, he told me that periodontal disease at this age is fairly normal to have and people over 25 or so have some level of it. He was not concerned. On top of that, I went back for a follow up for the chipped filling and he gave me a discount because I paid in cash and he’s a great guy! Did the filling for less than $300!

I recommend anyone reading this to go here. You won’t have a bad experience and you’ll have honest and trustworthy folks assisting you with your dental needs.<//Text>

<review>Excellent staff, and courteous.  They will make every attempt to make you feel comfortable and welcome in the office. The work Dr. Mee and his staff provides is premium and fair priced.
His office is an open layout, updated modern look, and bright. It doesn't feel like youre walking into a dentist appointment, and the cost doesn't reflect like it looks. Walking in there you'd think it was an expensive club, but his prices are fair and the work is guaranteed. I've had a crown replaced, and with insurance it was competitive with other local dentists.
I've been a customer for 2 years now and I'm extremely fortunate to have found another honest and talented dentist. I've been to bad ones in the past too, so I can compare without bias. Dr Mee will take care of you and your family and I recommend him when asked.<//review>< user_name>

First thing when I walked it was how fancy and nice this dental office was. Doesn’t even look like a dental office so it was pretty dope to see a unique dental office like this one. The people that work there are really nice. They were all helpful and cool to talk too. Great experience going again for my next appointment.< /Review>

My experience with State Street Dental has been nothing but perfection! It’s the way a business should be ran. Came in yesterday to schedule a appointment for a filling coming out (by another dentist) they got me a next day appointment. Everything was clean, the office staff was super friendly, and Doctor Mee was amazing. While working on me he made sure I was feeling nothing and was super gentle. They were able to schedule future appointments while I was sitting in the chair. All in all I would recommend anyone and everyone to come here. I’m very pleased with my experience and look forward to future visits.< /text>

Gorgeous faculty, highly trained technicians, friendly staff and great service!

We relocated to Lake Arrowhead and wanted to find a new dentist closer to our home and came across State Street Dental while doing research.

I have never seen a dentist office that was so nice (previously lived in Los Angeles) and my dentist were all in Beverly Hills.

The staff is so pleasant and Dr. Mee is exceptionally personable and knowledgeable. The equipment and facility is top notch.

I highly recommend.< /Review>

Just had a great experience at State Street Dental. Had a cleaning and x-rays and exam, and it was super fast, comfortable, and thorough. They use all the modern technology, no more polish grinders and huge metal hooks for the cleaning. Fantastic. They also just moved offices and it's a great space. Very welcoming and friendly, with water and coffee while you wait. TVs in the exam rooms to help distract you, just a great experience all the way around. Would definitely recommend to a friend.</Text>

But it wasn’t until we recently heard from a friend that visited that we decided to give them a shot. My kids were comfortable with our previous dentist so I was nervous about going to someone new. Our experience was great from the moment we called. They were very friendly & thorough. Everyone was welcoming when we walked in on the day of our appointment. Marleigh cleaned our boys’ teeth and they both loved her! And Dr. Mee was very kind, honest and answered all of my questions. Highly recommend State Street Dental!<//Text>< pictures>

As a person mortified by dentists I have to say, these are the only people I’ll ever let touch me again!! The relaxed atmosphere, the genuinely nice nurses and doc, and the attention to care I received was above my expectations!!! Never felt my shots, never felt them extract the tooth just in and out no hassle no pain procedure!! I’ll be recommending state street dental to anyone and everyone!!</Text>

ABSOLUTELY the Best Dental Experience I've ever had &  I've been going to dentists since my childhood...

Soft Teeth & No Enamel a tooth ache one day a root canal or 2 or 3 the next or extractions

I've never met a more kind..patient..gentle..detail oriented...caring...empathetic...honest.. dentist ever

And his Staffs pretty spectacular themselves!! They have always gone above & beyond to make sure I was comfortable

Thank You
You have a lifetime patient in me
Love Love Love you guys!!<//text>

I absolutely love this office!  Besides the fact that it is totally gorgeous and very comfortable, Dr. Mee and his staff are exceptional.  They're very warm and friendly and make you feel at ease.  The treatment I've received there so far has been excellent and I actually look forward to future visits. I highly recommend this office - you'll be in great hands!</review>

I highly recommend State St Dental. Dr. Mee and his office staff are amazing and so professional. I have had a nightmare experience with my previous dentist.  I feel blessed and so relieved to have found Dr Mee and State St Dental.<//Text>

5/31 UPDATE: Went in for a check up, friendly and fast service. High-tech equipment, the nicest staff and professional, explaining every step of the process. Highly recommend!

Had such a great experience at State Street Dental today. Went in, unexpectedly, without an appointment for a chipped tooth and they were able to accommodate me. The facility was clean and modern, I absolutely loved it! Above all, my tooth was fixed! The team there was super friendly, walked me through the process of everything, I will definitely be back and recommend to friends and family.<//review>

Normally going to the dentist is a terrible experience for me - but I have to say,  I felt really good about my visit to State Street Dental. The staff is very nice and welcoming ...and it's weird that an amenity like a TV on the ceiling is a game changer,  but it really distracted me from the metal on the teeth that usually makes me cringe.</Review>

<Text>Thank you thank you so much for getting my daughter out of pain. My daughter had a great experience with this practice. She went to two other dental offices and she wasn’t happy with the care of service she received. Her words from the moment she walked in she felt very comfortable the front office ladies were very nice to her and very helpful. When she got to the back the assistant Shannay who took her X-Rays was super fast and totally cool and very efficient she made her Feel at home. After getting the X-Rays she was told she needed a extraction she was scared at first but when the Dr. came in and talked to her about everything and explained what was going to happen in details he made her feel at ease. She said Dr. Mee had such a soft tough not rough at all very gentle and patient . From this experience she now wants to be a patient from here on out. She LOVES this place. I want to thank the entire team for making my daughters experience a Pleasant one... You all Rock !!!< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating><Response>None</Response>< pictures>

I was very nervous going in having a very bad experience as a kid at another dental office, but they made me feel comfortable with every procedure they were doing and answering all my questions. Having anxiety the dr and staff were super patient with me the entire time til I felt comfortable to continue .. loved that they don’t pressure you! Office is very nice and modern doesn’t feel like a dental place.. dr and staff by far the best</Text>

I absolutely love going to this dentist. I do not trust to go anywhere else. Growing up my family has always jumped from dentist to dentist and we were never able to find a good one until we came across Dr. Mee. I have been lucky enough to be his patient for a few years now and I refuse to go anywhere else. The entire team is all so friendly and make you feel at ease. Dr. Mee truly has the patients best interest in mind and does not try to sell you on unnecessary procedures like most. This is one place I look forward to going to because I know I am in good hands. I 100% recommend  that everybody should give State Street Dental a try because I promise you won't regret it!<//text>

<Text>Very skilled dentist. His background in education is superb. Definitely someone you can trust with your dental needs. He is gentle and takes the time to create a trusting and professional relationship with his guests. I felt immediately welcomed by all staff involved. The relationship between him and the staff is professional and respectful. I will most definitely be coming back. I enjoyed my experience and did not feel as if I was part of a cattle drive (my issue with past dentists). It was a breath of fresh air when I was invited back to my appointment quickly and was in my same chair from x-rays to exam to cleaning. Can we have duplicates of Dr. Mee in all 50 states?< /Text>< Pics>

Most incredible Dentist you could ask for . PAINLESS, Professional, Skilled, and gentle! I spent about 10 combined hours with him. It was an absolute breeze. His patience and quality of work were top notch, catered to the most pleasurable dental experience I have had in the last 20 years. From root canals to fillings , Veneers to crowns I got unprecedented quality and treatment.. beyond impressed! First class office, equipment, and staff. I would recommend Dr. Mee to any Family, friend, or stranger!

Thank you Citrus View!!</review>

I really dislike going to Dentist but, here at State Street Dental Office the overall environment, the staff, and Dr. Mee make it such a pleasurable experience for me! Such a Bougie Waiting Room that has you second-guessing did you walk into the correct storefront. This definitely does not look like a typical standard dentist office. Strangely, it feels warm and welcoming even while catering to the Redlands Elitists. Keurig, donuts, and snacks waiting for you to enjoy....The donuts look so perfect I thought they were fake. I had to really scratch my head and ponder...There's no way a dentist office would have fresh donuts for you to enjoy. I almost don't want to write such a great review and keep this dentist my secret but, I'm sure that secret is already out considering the long wait times for scheduling appointments. I love to see young hip viable doctors in our community that embrace change, technology, and great customer service! This is not your typical stodgy old-school dentist.<//text>

This is my 4rd time coming to State Street Dental and I plan continue coming. I’ve had 2 teeth cleanings, 1 appt for fillings, and 1 consult. The office has a great atmosphere. It’s modern, has a fun waiting room (Tv, coffee, good magazines), and your wait time is never more than 5 minutes. The staff are incredibly nice and professional. The front desk workers are kind, always willing to try to squeeze me in with my tough schedule, and friendly when patients arrive and check out. The hygienists (I’ve worked with 3 now) are professional, personable, and do a great job. The dentist: hands down a great guy all around, Dr. Mee is young, but has plenty of experience to make you feel comfortable and know you’re getting the job done right. He has competitive prices and doesn’t charge for consults (so nice!), and he stays late on Wednesday’s and Thursdays to work around your work schedule. This office is great and I hope to continue to see it thrive. They are doing an excellent job there and you won’t regret spending a visit to them.<//Text>

<review>This is not your parents' dental office. It feels and looks more like a contemporary day spa. I actually had to take a double take, because I thought I had walked into the wrong office. The office staff are extremely friendly and professional without seeming aloof or uncaring. The day I was there, they were playing classic rock, which helped distract me from my typical anxiety of a dental visit. Once Dr. Mee examined my issue, he gave me choices and helped me make an informative decision. There was virtually no pain involved in a procedure that other dentist are sure to cause. So, if you're someone that has anxiety and just an overall fear of going to the dentist, Dr. Mee and his amazing staff will banish those fears for good. I can't thank them enough.<//review><UserId.>113131862653658044993<//UserId.><Time>1540074085449<//Time><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

My daughter had to get her tooth pulled per the recommendation of her orthodontist.  What could have been a very scary experience (first time having a tooth pulled) turned out to be a very positive one. Every staff member we encountered was very nice, the decor in the office looks like it belongs in a magazine, and Dr. Mee was excellent.  My daughter is looking forward to going back!

This was by far one of the best dental visits I have ever had. I often avoid the dentist, due to my slight dental anxiety but Dr.Mee and his staff were so professional and friendly, the visit was effortless. Marleigh was my hygienist, she was extremely caring, gentle, and personable! She made the entire appointment very comfortable - I loved her! Dr.Mee has amazing chair-side manner and was super friendly and professional. I can tell he takes pride in providing quality dental work and seems to be very ethical/conservative in the way he treatment plans any necessary dental work needed! The office is clean, well-decorated, and totally state of the art! I am so thrilled I found a new dental home and would recommend State Street Dental to anybody looking for a calm, professional, and clean atmosphere! Thank you to the entire staff for an amazing visit!<//Review>

He is professional, and honest. His front office hero Stephanie, is fantastic and so are his staff. The ladies, RDA's, and DA's are so kind and patient. Shannay, is fantastic. Everyone and everything at this office is the best.  I hate needles but the nurse/ assistant was fast and told me what was going on. It wasn't bad at all. Everything about this office is 5+++ stars. The dental work, the knowledgeable staff, and this office is so professional. If you want a great dentist, and the best experience; this dental office is the only place to go. Thanks, see you soon.

Dr. Mee and State Street Dental are simply amazing. The the moment you walk into the door you immediately know this isn’t your normal dental office. It’s very modern and stylish. It appears that no expense was spared in creating this space. There were 2 large screen TVs in every room I saw which was super cool. The X-ray machine and 3D imaging machine used to create my crown were clearly the newest and best technology.

The staff is always very warm and helpful. From the front desk to the hygienists everyone is super customer service oriented and polite. It’s really nice to interact with all the staff.

Dr. Mee is a really cool dentist. For me, he’s the perfect blend of personable and professional. I always feel comfortable in the chair, I know what’s going on, and I trust him. We’ve made a couple decisions together regarding my care and I feel he thoughtfuly helped me make the best decisions. As far as the actual dental work goes, he’s smooth, careful, and gentle. I hate being at the dentist. Dr. Mee and his staff definitely make me feel comfortable and secure.

I highly suggest Dr. Mee and State Street Dental!</Review>

I started going to Dr. Mee after moving to Redlands.  Office staff are friendly and professional. Dr. Mee is excellent and goes above and beyond for his patients. He actually cares about what he does and has the well being of his patients in mind.  I've been recommending him to friends for years.

I've been going to Dr. Mee for 3 years now and his practice just keeps on getting better and better. The new office is absolutely gorgeous and beautifully designed.  It's the best office of any doctor I've ever seen. There are snacks, coffee, comfortable seating, and TVs on the walls and ceilings for you to use during visits.  The entire staff are wonderful, caring, and excellent at what they do.  Stephanie is always helpful and has taken care of me and my wife on the insurance and appointment side of things for years.  It's conveniently located next to the parking lot but they do have four spaces in the back in case that lot and street parking are full.  If your insurance covers this practice it's a no brainer.</review>

When you walk into Dr. Mee’s Office you feel like you’ve been transported to one of your favorite Pinterest boards for decor, and never want to leave. It’s a beautifully designed office, clean, and welcoming. Stephanie at the front is an excellent first impression of the business, she is friendly, professional and will take care of your appointments, and insurance billing. The hygienist is gentle and attentive, and Dr. Mee is all of the above! In one visit, I got caught up on years of missed dentist appointments; x-rays, gum measurements, cleaning, Dr. Eval, and recommendation for Invisalign, which Dr. Mee does at his office! Is it strange to say that I can’t wait to go back?!< /text>

I broke a tooth a year ago and the dentist I had fix it did some shoddy work. Hey, just my luck. That repair recently came undone a second time and so I felt that maybe I should let another Dentist have a crack at it. I tried Dr. Mee and he was great. He fixed the problem and explained to me what had gone wrong to cause it. The knowledge of the trade on Dr. Mee's part was most appreciated. Having work done on my teeth is never a pleasure, but Citrus View Dental definitely made the experience as pleasant as I could hope for.</review>

Just moved to Redlands and needed a new dentist. I normally hate going to the dentist, but Dr. Mee was great. He made me feel comfortable and was honest about everything. Was a funny guy too. I also liked that his office is right in down town by state street, walking distance from my house! If you're looking for a new dentist in Redlands, I would say Citrus view dental is a good choice.< /review>

Have to say, the concern and detail awareness of this dentist goes way beyond what I've experienced in the past. Dr. Mee was able to tell me the reason for a tooth's discoloration (it had died) after years of asking my previous dentist.

He also noticed 2 pre-cavities that were never mentioned by my previous dentist, even though I had x-rays EVERY SINGLE TIME. what a rip-off.

I'm so happy to have found a dentist in the area who seems not only to be more knowledgeable, but have wonderful bedside manner to boot. highly recommend.<//Text>

< Review>
Dr. Mee is by far the best dentist I have ever visited.  I have had bad teeth ever since I was young.  I have memories of crying in the dentist's chair at 6 years old ( and a few times as an adult!).  I have never liked the dentist and would put off visits until I was in pain.  That has resulted in a lot of dental work over the years.  I was hesitant to see Dr. Mee, because of the amount of work that needed to be done, and just what bad shape my teeth were in.  But after some encouragement from family and assurance from him and staff that they were sure they had seen worse, I made my first visit.  I am so glad I did.  I have had 3 more visits since then and have been so happy with Dr. Mee, the pleasant atmosphere in his office, and his friendly and efficient staff.  I have never had to wait long in the outer office, I have had no pain during the procedures and no discomfort after the numbness wore off.  I was so surprised the first time I was injected.  Dr. Mee said "your will feel a pinch" and I felt no pinch, just some warming.  I worried about the long drive home after he finished a lot of major work.  The 6 hours back to Utah were no problem at all.  No pain.  Such a difference from the usual torn up gums and achy teeth I had come to expect after a long dentist's visit.  Dr. Mee's education and gentle techniques shine through.  His friendly, upbeat "chairside" manner put you at ease and make you feel unjudged.  My teeth look and feel so much better.  I will no longer put off regular cleanings and exams.  Dr. Mee and his staff have made such a difference in my oral health and the quality of my life.  Visit him.  You will immediately see the difference a GREAT dentist can make!  Thanks Dr. Eric Mee and staff!</Review>

We asked for the pupusa revulta.
One of their breakfast which includes shrimps and a pupusa of your choice
And the beef soup with a salvadorian meat dish called salpicon.
This is a family friendly restaurant with very friendly staff.

This place has everything: great food, good music and an excellent staff, great job guys! Totally worth the trip!!!< /Text>

My family and I had lunch here. When came they have a DJ playing some Spanish songs by various artist. We were greeted and seated promptly.  The place was nice and clean. The portion of the food that they serve per order was little small for the price that you're paying. I thought that their was too pricey$$$ for the amount of food that they serve.<//Text>

Customer service was excellent. Food varies. Some items I really enjoyed. Others were just not my thing. I would return and order what I like, or consider trying what employees/patrons recommend.<//Review>

<Text>Ordered 4 corn tamales with cream each one individual orders but only got the 4 tamales with one cream order. Also ordered 8 pupusas and asked for extra curtido and got less than half regular amount they are supposed to give. Always cutting corners to save money and prefer loose customers.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I order breakfast here it was fried plantains  with beans and cream.I was disappointed in how small the portions of beans and cream were. The beans tasted great but they were very watery? The plantains looked over cooked on the outside. The inside was bearly cooked through. The slices were so thick it was hard to eat and dry👎. The staff had to be my best experience there they where so nice and polite👍. Over all wont go back there😞<//text>

Seafood is really bad. It has no type of style and texture at all. Hamburgers are really dry. The only thing that is somewhat okay. Would be there pupusas, I tasted better. To expensive as and not worth it.</Review>

Very pricey for small portions of food. I ordered pupusas and 2 clado de gallina. Very little.veggies on the soup and the pupusas were so small. I was really disappointed.  Food is not all that tasty. So never again< /Text>

I thought I'll give this place a second chance... And I did.the pupusas are okay in taste but their small size and over price makes them not worth buying. The platanos Fritos portions .Are over price as well.button line I'm never going back there. Theirs many better pupusas restaurants in Maywood and bell.< /Text>

<Review>I was in town visiting... to be honest the pupusas weren't impressive to me, much rather drive to ecko park and get pupusas there. Also order a rigua which I've had better in Las Vegas. Just my 2 cents.<//Review>< Pictures>

Came here for the first time to try some pupusas and soup. I ordered chicken soup and what I got was a plate of grilled chicken with rice/vegs with a side of soup(which was more expensive). When confronting the waitress about the wrong order, she said that if I wanted chicken soup with the chicken in the soup, you must clarify it. Apparently, simply saying chicken soup means you want a plate of grilled chicken and rice with a side soup instead of actually a bowl of soup with chicken. Anyways, the grilled chicken was good, but the soup itself was extremely salty. After a few spoonful, my tongue started to have that "burning" sensation you get from too much salt and this coming from someone that enjoys salty food. The pupusas I ordered were surprisingly good, however, I won't be back due to blatant upselling.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible place, to order for Uber they don't care to send you pupusas for tortillas or send you some buttery made from pure chicharrón
When the order is for a cheese with loroco, it gives them THE SAME!

(Original)
Terrible  lugar, para  pedir por Uber les da igual mandarte  pupusas por tortillas  o mandarte unas  mantecosas de  puro chicharrón

(Translated by Google) The food is Salvadorian, the pupusas and tamales are delicious. The first time I went, I was given regular size pupusas. The second time they gave me tiny tamales, and pupusas that fit in a small container. The food is delicious but very small size.

I have always taken my vehicles here. Trust is important and I feel the Gentlemen that run this shop are fair and keep my vehicle safe for me to drive. Plus is they are hilarious to talk to when you are stressed about your vehicle.<//Text>

Dale & Dustin saved us today. We were broke down far from home as we were passing through town and they, in spite of a very busy day, they came to our rescue and worked on our vehicle in a very timely manner. The cost came under the estimate. Just overall really friendly and helpful service. They honestly saved our vacation. Thank you A Action Automotive!< /text>

Steve, Dale, and all the mechanics at A Action are great mechanics. If you are looking for honesty. This is the place to go. They won't fix things just for an extra buck. They have been my mechanics for the past 8 or so years. I may have to stop driving if they ever decide to retire. Honest, hard working, quick, affordable. These are just a few words to describe these wonderful bunch of guys.<//Review>

I used to hate it and now because of A Action, I love it! My Jeep runs better than it ever has! The dealer wouldn’t touch it and neither would any other shops. The all told me that they couldn’t hook up a computer to it so they couldn’t work on it. I took my Jeep in for a hard to diagnose fuel problem (I’ve had the wrong fuel pump in it the entire time I’ve owned it) and it came back to me purring like a kitten, exhaust leak fixed, and sagging passenger door fixed all at no additional charge! I have pride in ownership again!</Text>< rating>

All of our cars, for around the past 8-10 years have been serviced by A Action.  I have found Steve, Dale and all the mechanics friendly, reliable and the service great and   affordable.
We have since moved out of state and we'll miss their service and advice when I needed it.  I'm hoping to find a mechanic here in Salisbury, N.C. that can at least match the great service I received at A Action.  Thank you Steve, Dale and all you guys. God bless.

I had my car taken here to have a diagnostic, I had told them that I had a power steering fluid leak.  I clearly wanted a further evaluation, yet they just said that I had a "power steering fluid hose leak".  Clearly I had known that already, I decided to figure out what the issue was and it was the power steering pressure hose.  They had told me it would cost more than 500$ to fix it, and then seemed shocked when I told them no.  So instead of paying 500$ to fix my car for a diagnostic they failed to let me know what the diagnostic was, I saved myself roughly 480$. DONT GO HERE!< /text>

Would not recommend. Go to Big Rob's at 9429 1st Ave, Hesperia instead. These guys will grind you for every last cent.< /Text>

Took my car in for water pump repair 500.50 then 2 weeks later my radiator leaks per  Dale pin hole on right side. Took it to radiator  shop  no pin hole put big dents in radiator and flushing  was never done on well or radiator fluid was dirty was ne changed it was quite evident called Dale to see if he would take responsibility  for action so who ever worked on my water pump beat up my radiator  more than a pin hole. Dale was rude and just said I sprung another leak. Dale you should be ashamed Iam fighting  Cancer and Iam on SS  for a business man you are not   doing right by the public you are really kind when you start but at the end its all bad if there is a problem . And you were over charging you quoted me 636.00 and I had it repaired for 320 shame on you. Hope you sleep well at night.< /review>

<text>If you don't mind the wait, for parts, Dale can save you big bucks. I saved 45% on a fuel pump replacement on my Audi compared to DreamCars who charges "at or below dealer prices" and we all know what a rip off dealer shops are. Thanks Dale, your the man!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I would not recommend this place if u need a diagnostic done.i was told what i needed to correct problem. Dale said he would call when done. Never did. Call them before closing was told car was done. Picked up vehicle next day drove 43miles check engine lite  turned on and vehicle shut off just like before. Took vehicle back asked them why the problem was still there? Dale couldn't give me an answer.left vehicle again kept all day. Called me end of day said what problem was and would cost couple hundred dollars but could not say that would fix the problem. Unless u have 2 cars and dont mind leaving ur car overnite and spending hundreds on a job that they wont guarantee i would stay away from this place. I also checked  the cost of my parts with 3 different place and found their charge for my part was almost double. So moral of story read reviews and go from there.</Text>

What a relief! These guys are professionals! Took my Cherokee in for two things (offbeat stuff. I'd just bought it and the prior owner had had jiggered with it.) Price seemed right, work was fine, My sense of confidence in them is very high! This feeling of confidence is worth a great deal to me... after all, incompetent mechanices are America's Hell. I live 25 miles from them but it's well worth the trip! Fred< /text>

When I questioned them about a high price for a cheap fix the price went up almost double. These people are shady, but then what do you expect when they hire out of VVC's auto department, there's a reason why that school was on probation.< /text>

<Review>Best prices , great vibe and very welcoming . I found this place online today and decided to stop by . I'm own a spiritual healing practice so I'm very careful where I  source my tools from. Energy is everything! This place had such a welcoming vibe . They were so helpful and knowledgeable..the prices you can't best anywhere else. I'll definitely be back the energy in place was great and you can tell they really value their customers.  I've purchasing crystals and other products years . And this place is definitely my home<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>After visiting so many shops I can say incense route is the one on which I can rely. They have the finest collection of incense oils. Here I have found some of the rare items which I have been searching for so long. Besides, they have a good collection of rocks which are comparatively better in quality then others. Also, their behaviour is so hospitable and helpful which allowed me to ask for details information of their products. Overall an A class place that you are seeking for.< /Text>< Pics>

Came to buy Palo santo oil and left with a few new pieces of beautiful cubic Fluorite, aquamarine and selenite crystals! This place has a loving vibe altogether. I love it. I will definitely be back very soon. Thank you incense route< /review>

<review>Easily one of the best essential oil and aromatherapy stores in LA. No one else comes close. Make sure you go to Incense Route and not one of the other stores in the complex.< /review>< pictures>

Best store in LA. You can find here everything what you need. Huge selection of essential,massage, and aroma oils. Helpful stuff will help you determine what oil for you is good. Definitely 5 stars.</text>

Incense Route has a diverse selection of oils, incense, candles and more.  I am really am so glad I found it because they have all the hard to find essential oils that you just can't find in stores and will be a repeat customer.  The staff is so nice and very knowledgeable, very helpful!</text>

<review>Customer service is perfect and not overbearing. They will say hello and then let you shop without wanting to ask you a million questions or sell you. If you have a question they will answer it for you to the best of their knowledge. Luxury candles of every color, scent and shape. A little overwhelming but they have everything and seemingly every brand. Prices are retail so be prepared but they have everything!</review>< Pictures>

We've been waiting for our bicycle to be picked up at the gas station. The servant was polite and willing to help me. He desired to work continuously and aggressively. Please embrace my heartfelt thanks for taking the time to read it.</review>

I'd rather go across the street to chevron pay a little extra for gas then deal with his bad attitude everytime i see him. When He is gone I'll return but until then I recommend getting gas and snacks across the street where they WANT your money and provide excellent customer service no matter who is there. If the management reads this and changes that one staff member I'll return. Everyone else there is great, friendly and professional.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Oh what a gas station! Never have I been more loved and embraced by a place like this. They will put gas in your car! All you have to do is give them some money. They have an exquisite selection in Corn Nuts, Oreos, and more. Their 4-day-old food had never been more fresh. OH what a place indeed. A place to stop by and just enjoy what life has given, appreciating the gas stations in our lives. My soul feels whole when I visit Conserv Fuel. I couldn't imagine where my life would be without Conserv Fuel. Would I have ever achieved my greatest achievements? Would I have ever lived to my fullest potential? I don't even want to think about. All that matters now is that I have Conserv Fuel in my life to make all things right. I urge you, neigh I BEG you, to fuel your car at Conserv Fuel. You will feel enlightened from all the sunflower seed options and displays of cokes. I am yet to find any place in the world more fantastic than this one. It will change your life forever just as it has changed mine. Maybe we'll start a religion around Conserv Fuel together? In any case, let this place teach you what it means to be whole.

Conserv Fuel, please sponsor me. I will do (almost) anything to promote your gas station. I'm broke and need to buy Starbursts from your store, so the money would help you and me. Please.</Review>

So unless you’re Hispanic or homeless you cannot go into the store without a mask. But you can go in to pay for a package of 10 mask for $10. Sick system.<//Review>

A good choice for picking up cheap gas.  The windshield cleaning stations are usually full.  8 gas pumps with diesel also available.  There is also a small market.</Text>

< Review>
Be ware of mechanic in this gas station. He rents his garage separately and is a total scam artist. He charged me $229 to replace a headlight bulb in my car. When I called the dealership the next day to see what they would charge it was $55!! Dealerships are usually a high priced fix so this guy is unbelievable! Be sure to STAY AWAY!!!!</Review>

For being a standalone hydrogen fueling station, it only has two pumps.  But, you can't complain.  At least it's there and open most of the time.</Review>

This is my go to gas station because it's close to home and on my work route.  This is also tge place where I purchase my weekly lottery tickets and yes, I'm waiting on my numbers to come in!  One can dream😂🎉🎈🧨

Now, come the 1st of the month and later in the week things become crowded and depending on how some drivers park, it becomes problematic trying to navigate getting in, around, and out of the gas station.

Friendly staff, patient and courteous even when encountering some rude customers. Clean establishment with a variety of snacks and beverages to select from.<//Text>

<user>108934064064544615259< /user><Text>Sorry ARCO, but my experience was less than pleasant at this location. It began when I wanted to pay with cash and the cashier put the amount on the wrong pump. After going between my pump and the cashier 3 times to tell him my pump was not on I was told the car next to me was pumping my gas. I asked him what he was going to do about it and asked if he was asking me to go and confront her because of his error he shrugged his shoulders and said he was alone. I then asked for my money back and he appeared frustrated as he stormed outside to stop the woman before she left. It was finally resolved, but I won't be back unless this station is my only choice the next time I visit Long Beach.</Text>< date>

<username>Ashley Knowles<//username><Text>Every time I go to Long Beach this is the only gas station that I stop at, love the staff they're friendly and the gas is cheaper. Sometimes it can get a little packed but that's cool because it moves fast, they do keep their store clean and that's a plus for me. Never noticed anything shady and never had a problem with attitudes from any of the staff that worked there.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< user_id>

The staff here is nice and the store is ok but, the outside is filthy. If this store was in a better area, this would not be allowed. Why hasn't ARCO or AM/PM inspected this gas station and made them power wash the outside.</Review>

They also carry automotive fasteners and hardware. You know the plastic ones that always break when you try to remove them. They also carry the metal clips that are used on a lot of dash assemblies in different shapes and sizes. They carry some 3ft.

<text>We purchased 14 bags of landscaping rock and asked for help loading them after paying for them. She said she would call for assistance and we waited and waited,  NO SHOW! I went inside to ask her again and she said again she had called! We are in our  70's and not too strong. It happened that a gardner was driving by and stopped to load the bags for us!!
This is the second time this has happened. We like shopping at Lowe's but their employees at times seem too busy to STOP AND HELP.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< user_id>

Only reason it's 4 stars is Lowe's still needs to work on their app. The store itself was perfectly fine as it almost always is. No issues with getting what I ordered, fast and easy.</text>

Very helpful sales staff - but the actual product selection was limited to many low cost options - the website showed many high cost options too - that was what I was looking for - kitchen faucets - but needed one the next morning.</text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>About two years ago we remodeled our home. Lowes was my primary source of purchases. We bought everything from: nails, screws, toilets, tarps, paint, rollers, brushes, tile, grout, trim, and more.
Lowes had a great selection. I appreciate the help of the staff and the size of the store. It is laid out extremely well.
You can find a great selection of wood. Make sure to look at the lumber and not get crooked wood. Some wood is straight but not all pieces.
When buying concrete look at the bags. Some are broken from people running their cart into the bags on accident.
They have a great selection of nice wood. We used it to make some really fun stuff in our home.<//text><time>1610736418632</time>< Rate>

Wide variety of just about anything and everything you could need but try to find somebody to help you? Thats  another story. I stood in the paint dept waiting for 20 + minutes as employees walked around avoiding another waiting customer, my friend and myself. I finally picked up the wall paging unit and announced over their P.A.for an employee to please come to the paint dept as customers have been waiting for 1/2 hour! They were not too happy, about that,and neither were we. The store was closing and no one ever came.
Not the 1st time on trying to get help there. It happens often, when you do get some help you get the feeling that you bothered them UNLESS YOU CAN FIND ANY OLDER EMPLOYEE, they are the ones that go out of their way and are happy to help.</review>

Only because I had an excellent Vet named Erik who was working in Lawn and garden. A very friendly and out going worker. Very  knowledgeable and pleasant when helping. The cashier Kristy was just as helpful and pleasant. Lowes should hire more people like these two. Way to go you two! Thank you<//Text>

<Review>We purchased a couple expensive products from Lowe's in Ventura, CA.
The two gals that helped us was Melissa M. & Alondra M. in appliances and they both were so amazing , very helpful and they went step by step with everything till the very end. Till we walked out the door they made sure our purchase was 100% complete. They both deserve something extraordinary!
Very kind, considerate, and really showed interest in what they did.
Employee's of the year, both of them.
Thank you both!< /Review></record>

Beware the price of appliances. Add the cost of the SERVICE PLAN into the cost. without the service plan @Lowe's wants nothing to do with you. My brand new @whirlpool dishwasher wouldn't finish it's first cycle. I called Whirlpool hoping it would be a easy fix however they needed to send a technician, who a week later didn't show up but called to say the code the machine gave would need parts that could be 4 to 6 weeks!! My call to Whirlpool  for repair was before the 30 days of delivery. The only question Lowe's was interested in was if I bought the service plan. Terrible customer service.<//review>

<Review>I live here! I'm in and out often and need this store in my life. I've learned never to need customer service. Couldn't get an employee to acknowledge you if you were on fire. As long as you know you are on your own it's a great place 10 x better than the other orange store! I'd give that place 0.< /Review>< Pictures>

I went to lowes early Saturday, to buy washer I had picked out the night before. The washer was $200 OFF PRESIDENT SALE, and another $100 off if you apply and use their credit card, I did. I`m looking for the washer I wanted found it, took a picture, no one working the department yet so I go to the front checkout, pickup some roses go to check out tell employee what I need, it would be best if I come back after 8:15am, when the person starts their shift.
I come back around 10am after employee finishes up with helping other customer I show them the washer I'd like they check and don't  have it there....I ask any store close by has it? Oxnard has 2 so 20 minutes later I'm in Oxnard after waiting for others to be helped I tell the employee whats happen so far, she checks her inventory right there, says let me verify that we have it.  She returns and tells me they have one and its reserved. Unable to buy my new washer I went home fixed the old one, hose had came loose rubbing a hole in it cost $32 for a new hose.
Thank you lowes for saving me over $500 that day!!<//Review>

I had 2 problems with my experience. First was a lack of communication on the limitations on how much lumber they would cut for you. Second was a copy of a key I had made that didn’t work when I got home.

This is the closest Lowe’s to me at 30 minutes away & I personally choose to support Lowe’s over Home Depot if I have the choice.  After picking out all my lumber, I confirmed with a sales rep in the lumber yard that they do not charge for cuts. I was directed to the register to purchase everything first. After cashing out, I flagged a rep down to assist with the cuts to which I was told that per policy they could only do a maximum of 4 cuts (I needed probably 10). Despite multiple opportunities, nobody cared to tell me this until after I’ve spent the time picking stuff out & swiping my card. I can’t fit the lumber in my car, & I don’t have the tools to cut it myself otherwise I wouldn’t have been asking if they could do it. The sales rep allegedly asked the manager if they can make an exception but after a few minutes he came back & said they could not. So I turned around & returned everything.

My other purchase that same day was 2 copies of a house key. After getting home, neither of them worked. So after 1 hour total of driving & time spent picking stuff out that I just ended up having to return, I have literally nothing to show for it. Awesome trip.</Review>

I ordered a dishwasher on line from Ventura Lowes. Be aware that when 1 item is listed as available online, it is the display and is not for sale. This means the item is actually NOT in stock. Also, employee after employee will tell you NOT to order online. It is as if lowes.com is a separate entity. This was apparently the first problem. They have now changed delivery twice. Once by calling me and once via email.  I still do not have the dishwasher and can't tell if and when I will receive it. They are incredibly difficult to get on the phone and insist that you come to the store. If this was a COVID issue - fine. I get that. But please be honest with your customer dealings. Don't say you have it when you don't and take my money without providing what was purchased.</text>

I give Mark in the plumbing department 100 stars.  He was incredibly attentive, undistracted, professional and knowledgeable.  He was warm and charming and kind.  I would definitely return to this plumbing department if Mark is on duty.<//Text>

Lowes has lost their way. I ordered an online item and paid $95 to have it delivered. Delivery was scheduled for Saturday between 3:30-7:30. Delivery was a no show. Went into the store the next morning (after trying to sort things out by phone only to be hung up on) and was told by the customer service representative that the item was in Northridge and couldn't be delivered and that there was nothing she could do. I asked for a manager. The manager says she's tried calling the Northridge store but they don't answer. What now Lowes? I'm still waiting for an update from the manager.<//Text>

I come here a few days a week and every teammate is very well knowledgeable, professional and passionate about helping you , one teammate especially is Jacklyn she always greets you you the up most sincerity, and never lets you leave without you having peace of mind knowing that you got the right product, with the information to complete  your job or task , with the simplest of ease  and that to me is more than 5 stars !!</Review>

I generally like Lowe's but they disappoint often. They only carry GE light bulbs and I'm looking for smart bulbs so I went online looked at my local store and saw they were on aisle 14 bay 4 - but of course, they weren't. Since you can't find anybody to help you there, often, you'd hope you could rely on the app mapping. But no.<//text>

They pretty much have everything except a variety of wood types. No walnut, no maple, and a limited amount of oak and poplar. If you want pine, this is your place. Other than that, this place rocks.< /text>

We ordered kitchen cabinet on 7/17, and it’s been almost 11 weeks that we haven’t got it.
We called and the customer service depart is a joke because no one would answer the phone, and even if they answered, they transferred you to a different department and then hung up on you. If you try to call back, no one would ever answer.</text>

<Text>Very disappointed,   went there to buy replacement screen door fabric, absolutely all the shelves were empty,  went to get 6 inch clay flower pots, again shelves totally bare. This seams to be a constant problem with Lowe's anymore.  It's not for lack of customers, just nothing on the shelf.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Name>

It was good. The bathroom's were actually open, if they had been closed, well I would not have been able to get what I needed. No restrooms is a very bad thing. Some people have a problem , and not helping that indevidual is not right. Say your from the out skirts of town and you need food or anything and you are having a personal problem, no place to go ! There for you must stay home. That's not right ! I'm very upset over this. But thank you Lowe's for the use of restrooms. It means a lot to all of us. Truly.</text>

I go to this Lowe's occasionally because it's the closest big chain hardware store. They have most of what you're expecting, but they don't rent or repair tools. Home Depot in Oxnard does if you need it. If you're on the west side of Ventura, check out G&S Hardware on Ventura Avenue.<//Review>

Its a very large store and somehow I only end up finding exactly what I'm looking for about half the time.  The staff isn't bad, but when you ask where something is you often get a vague description of where it might be instead of offering to show you.  I go a lot because its close to my house, but I'd much rather go to home depot or ace hardware.</text>

Edit: Order was fulfilled but there is no curbside service. If you order online, expect to wait in a long customer service line to get your pre-paid items.</text>< pictures>

<review>This is the worst Lowes that I have ever visited.  Staff is non-existent and when you find one unfriendly and not helpful.  The order on-line system is a joke.  Eight hours and not ready as they have one person picking.  Home Depot is on top of this while Lowes Ventura provides lip service and not customer service.  Sad as this used to be a great store.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Good place to get all your home improvement items you need. Good selection & they have a good floor plan. Only rated 3 stars because you will need to watch out. When you see a yellow new low price sticker, take a picture of it because the registers are not showing the new lower price. Make sure you take a picture of the low price sticker so they can adjust the price correctly at the register.</text>< Time>

<Review>A wonderful store but had trouble near the back left of the building. A horrible smell protruded from a fellow shopper and it became unbearable. I had to rush from the store leaving my infant child in the cart behind. If anyone encounters a baby near the back left please return him to the local police station. Thank you.< /Review><user>113969591381985366626<//user>< Pics>

Horrible place. Do not buy here. Curb pick up is a joke. I have a son with lung disease that is why i choose curb pick up. They never answered the phonem wIting outside for an hour. Finally had to go in tbe store. Workers there dont carw about you. Even pleading with tbem to bring my paid item outside for me because of health risk with covid. They said no. My email confirmation about curb pick up was sent to me. But they said they dont do that anymore. No one ever answrr the phone in this store.  Lowes in ventura is a shame. Health conpromise people are not important fir them. I guess Liwez is just for strong and healthy people.</review>

If you are ordering something and thinking your delivery will go well and it's not going to happen to you..well think again because it will!  2 weeks delay in delivery because they put the floors on the "wrong type of truck" then instead of 48 boxes of floors we get 36 plus missing underlayment! Do yourself a favor and don't order from Lowe's!< /Review>

<Review>I would give 4 stars because the lady really helped us; but they didn't have any of the freezers that was on display on sale. Her cumpter said the  Inventory was there but when she would go back for the ones we wanted she said nothing was back there so he ended up getting a freezer that cost way more which in the end for me I love, but my husband was a little upset but the customer service was great.<//Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>We find so much more here than the Home Depot in Goleta. It's massive in comparison as well as cleaner. There is an even better stocked Lowe's in Oxnard that an employee at the Ventura store told me to go to when I was looking for something. But normally, the Ventura store has what I need without having to drive farther. The traffic in the area is a bit daunting the first time you visit.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmd4fcTkPA_aj1BNOvBoVHRvBoGRLyrT2MeSS1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<Review>This store has by far the worst customer service. My one day project was delayed by 15 days due to their inability to track the order, dropping transfer calls, poor service in flooring department and Annie assistant manager never picking up.  They said the order would take up to 10 days from their main warehouse. After that 10th day, I started calling, somedays I would wait up to 30 mintues for them to pick up the phones and gave me the "its on it's way" answer. It took me 2 in store trips to speak to someone and ended up cancelling the order.< /Review>< resp>

Big box home improvement store.   Pros should know better, these are last resort and hope they have what you need places.   DIYers, it has stuff.   They're about buying cheap and selling at volume.< /review>

<Review>Well organized place with helpful staff to assist.  I like the coordination between the website for Isle and Bin location of products.  There is always someone to greet you and help buttons in each department.  Lumber-wise, the products do need looked over for eyeballed for strait-ness.  However, generally you can find what you need and at a fair price.< /Review>< Pictures>

Went for some patio furniture and it was all glass and metal. No wicker or cloth. Had to find my outdoor set at Green Thumb. Good prices for what was available.<//review>

<Review>Where has all the helpful people gone there yes one guy out six people we asked for help even  customer service person i think it wss the manager but im not sure were reluctant to help us . What should have beena  thirty minute trip turned into over an hour passed around from one associate to another none wanting to help .  It makes you the customer feel bad for bothering them  the customer service ttold mre to go to the cashier to help us special order adoor then we got passed from one to another . Do they work there or are they there just to walk around doing i dont know what  . I went there again tonight and i walked by four or five associates did one ask if i needed help did one even look at ne and say hi nope not one ! I counted 8 zombies they call associates i have another name for them starts the zame way but different . Wake up people ypu are there to help the customer not just pass time till you can gp home and live in avirtual life</Review>< Pics>

Today I went in to buy wood bolts and waited 10 minutes before giving up on someone to help. They sent for someone to help too. They had 9 bolts and I needed 50. Bought the 9 bolts but will have to get the others somewhere else.

Then I went to buy a pneumatic nail gun. They had the one I wanted but the gentleman said they do not carry 3 1/2 inch nails. So again, off to another store.<//Text>< pics>

They always have what you need.  Management needs to give better training to cashier's, and inventory control.  Cahiers need to have a better process than yelling to the person next to them how to do something.  It's a time waster.  Some products were yards/meters away and not in the designated bins.  These items were moved some time ago but not updated.  The good news is everyone is very friendly and willing to help, 4 stars minus one for management.<//Review>

Went in on 1/16/20 to purchase a garbage disposal identical to the existing one and have it installed.  I was told not to buy it because the installer had to first do a $40 inspection to make sure I got the right one.  Installer came on 1/20, asked where was the disposal and signed waiver.  I called the Ventura store but no one in installtion would answer. I called the 1+800 number for clarification.  They tried calling the store but no one would answer.  I went to the store on 1/21 purchsed the disposal and cord.  I ended up having a clerk in the appliance department (no one in installation would help) complete the installation summary, paid $89 and was told that the installer would contact me to install on 1/23, nobody called.  The 1+800 customer service was finally able to have someone in installation call me and promise that installation would be done between 12 & 4 PM on 1/27.  Waited till 3:30 PM on 1/27, nobody called.  The store had me call the installer who told me that I was not on their schedule but would do the installation between 9 & 12 AM 1/28.  Installation was completed on 1/28.  I would not currently use this store's installation services for any appliances at this time.  Their installation dept. is just a Service Dept. with the key word Customer missing.< /Review>

They have more stuff than you can shake a stick at, I don't even know what to say . They have everything that you would want for home improvement, maintenance, and so on. If you haven't ever been inside of Lowe's home improvement, do yourself a favor and at least go inside and browse.<//Text>

At this point I told him I would take my business somewhere else. Would’ve been a $300 sale, your clerk was unprofessional and would rather cut keys for other people.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< review>
Customer service at Lowe's is none existing at the Ventura store. Even one of the managers that leaves a message saying she'll call you back tomorrow as she is leaving work doesn't call back. They should just go to having employees stock the shelves at night and customers help themselves and use all self checkout. Don't even have employees during open hours cause that's what it feels like to me shopping there now. This review excludes the Garden department, where I have always received great service; especially Susie- she rocks!</review>

The store is OK I have gone there many many many times they always have what I want for more than I want to pay for it so I settle for what I need at OK price which they always have too. I think all these hardware stores get together to decide how much we can pay and then go up a dollar or 2 to watch us squirm.< /review>< Resp>

<review>Made a purchase online through their website. I printed out a copy of my receipt has instructed and brought it with me. This receipt has a barcode on it. I felt certain everything they needed would be contained in that barcode. When I got to the store, nobody knew what to do with my receipt or how to find my items. It took them several minutes at the customer service desk to finally send me back to outdoor Garden where I came from to pick up my items. Outdoor Garden told me I needed to go into customer service. It seems quite odd that a company like Lowe's would have a website allowing me to purchase items informing me when they're available at my store location, charging me and giving me a receipt for my purchase while no one at the store location knows how to process any of this. One gentleman , Danny, was extremely helpful and pleasant. Better training on online procedures at the store level is definitely needed.</review><userid>112612154714426820746<//userid>< date>

An assistant manager then needed our checker to do some customer service work. He stopped the cashier for him to look up a previous order for a customer, and held us up another 4 or 5 minutes. Also, I have been on hold for more than 10 minutes at a time when calling to find out the availability of a product. If there were somebody closer, with the same products, I would be there first.<//text>< userid>

I'm afraid it fell into the  stereotypical home improvement place... where there where lots of people but no one interested in helping anyone. When you finally do find people they are busy or annoyed your bothering them. I waited about 15min to get anyone to help me, even had someone paged but the associate bearly glanced down the isle before moving on. I even tried to wave him down but he was moving too fast to even notice me. Least to say I was very frustrated by this point as my kids where losing their patients waiting. I finally just threw up my hands and moved on without the lamps I wanted. Very disappointed.<//review>

It's Lowe's home improvement store what else can I say.  Miles and miles of product filled shelves and no help.   It is conveniently located in Ventura California.  Far more expensive than the home Depot in Oxnard.   The cashiers are very friendly.< /Review>

I have had multiple bad experiences with this store. After Bringing the issues to the management the response I got was to wait for them to try to figure something out. After months, they finally figured out that I would get a refund for to help alleviate the issues I had. The Refund was less than 10% of what I had spent in the store over the time while remodeling my house. Even though the manager told me that she would be able to give me at least 10% of my purchases it I waited. Since waiting on them I have since accrued interest on my lowes card that I am now responsible for. I have always loved Lowes and used them to remodel multiple houses. These experiences have put a sour taste in my mouth about the store. The unfortunate thing is that they are the only option in my area, unless I want to drive 20 mins to Home Depot.< /text>

<text>Went I Sunday am around 8:00 am. Wanted to see and learn about kitchen appliance packages. Terrible service. Asked the only guy in the dept for help and was basically told we were on our own to figure out what we wanted. He just leaned over the computer work station the whole,time we were there. Finally we left to find a place that had helpful employees.
Thank you for letting me share the truth.< /text>< gmapID>

This is the best Lowe's store there is their staff is so friendly especially at the customer service desk. They are always nice and upbeat and quick and courteous. Don't forget about their year plant guarantee. Also you can sign up for a my Lowes card and you don't even have to keep your receipt they will email them to you automatically..< /review>

thay have a big construction inventory a good customer service also the only thing I didn't liked is that they don't have enough cashier's now almost all are self check and at the end is a big issue because some of the items don't have barcode and you have to wait for someone to come over and help</Review>

<Text>It's clean and uncluttered unlike Home Depot. We found the gas stoves were on sale and the lady who helped us sold it to us for the store price, which is lower than the website price. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because of the one month wait for delivery.<//Text>< userid>

Went today to get a few things. Asked 6, yes 6 employees where things were. No one knew. No one offered to help. Basically no one gave a shi*. Tried calling to speak with a manager and no one answers the phone. Awesome customer service... not.<//Text>

<Text>Pulled up to the store, parking lot semi empty thinking service should be great not too many customers. Should be a pleasant experience which was not the case. Was greeted as I walk in, ask where the plumbing section was proceeded on my way get there needing assistance no one to be found. Came across a garden associate asked for assistance and said not my department but I'll get you someone. Asked an associate in paint got the same response. Walked towards lumber then the back aisle ended up back in plumbing still one to be found. This was My first shopping experience at Lowes. A store with no too many customers but yet can't get any service as well. Home Depot far from perfect but there at least I get some type of service.<//Text><Rate>1</Rate></record>

They typically have what you need. Glad the social distancing is setup at the checkout and customer service counter now. I do find that it tends to be a little overcrowded at the entrance and exit points.</review>

It was okay! I bought runners for my house a floor person assisted me in finding it. I ask was it 6.98 when he grabbed it from box. The guy says yes. I get to register in its 12.95. I paid for it anyways in the sales person says we miss tag things.  I wasn't mad but I think he should of gave it to me at the 6.98 but cause that's what the box said that it was in.<//text>

<Text>It was okay! I bought runners for my house a floor person assisted me in finding it. I ask was it 6.98 when he grabbed it from box. The guy says yes. I get to register in its 12.95. I paid for it anyways in the sales person says we miss tag things.  I wasn't mad but I think he should of gave it to me at the 6.98 but cause that's what the box said that it was in.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I gave it 5 stars because this is good as Lowe's gets compared to some of the other ones. They do try pretty hard but sometimes it just doesn't happen. Regardless going to a Lowe's in Ventura smokes going to a Lowe's in LA County any day.< /Review>

< review>
Terrible service over 4 visitis trying to complete one project!!!
Given the wrong information on availability of product, go to,pick up find out there is a 5 day
Special order, select another product, purchase, get to the job & it is not at all what I was told.
Return product, not given the option of cash/exchange, service rep just automically processes the $$ returned to my acct making it impossible for me to re-purchase another product for 3-5 days.
Return to store, discuss issues with manager Annie, who was very helpful, but then when I was ready to finalize the purchase, not one service rep would find the Manager, page the manager insisting on trying to help....WALKED OUT EXTREMELY disappointed with the lack of customer service, lack of product knowledge and resistance to locate management when requested.
NEVER AGAIN.</review>

I don't know how this place stays in business. I buy one product from them almost every day. The shelf is regularly unstocked, and god forbid I inconvenience an employee to get one down from overstock. Typically 10 to 15 min. Later they'll huff and puff their way over, and Take another 10 minutes to get a latter. This results in me being late to my jobs, and having to calm down my customers. I've spoken to the manager, assistant manager, and a hand full of employees. No one cares. Corporate America at its finest. I'll be talking with Ace hardware on Monday about stocking the product I need.</Text>

The last several visits to Lowe's have been a dissappointment for my husband. Two times now, they are out of the item he wanted to buy, and can't say when they will have it. They aren't specialty items he needs.
But today's visit was really surprising . My husband went to get some tape, they were out of the kind he wanted. I picked out some replacement slats for vertical blinds, and asked for an associate to cut them to size. She said that the machine they use to cut the blinds has not been hooked up since they rearranged the store. I asked when it would be hooked up, thought I could come back in a couple of days. She said the machine would not be ready until December 31st! That Lowe's is waiting for the electrician to come, and when he does, he will take care of all machines at one time.
Are you kidding me?! What horrible customer service, to rearrange the store without a better plan than this!< /Text>

As a local handyman i am in this store at least once a day, often several times. Their staff is somewhat knowledgable but often relying on other departments which know nothing of neoghboring departmemts to cover breaks for the one "professional" department staff. No one seems happy to work here except the ones in brown vests visiting from other Lowes for stocking purposes. Speaking of stock, always out of what you need and disorganized. Short cut 3/4 in copper tubing has been out of stock for a while. Save your time and go to Home Depot.< /Review>

Not only were the items I was after stacked in such a way that it was difficult to safely retrieve (I actually was injured), it was near impossible to get assistance. The girl working the checkout also had a hard time getting assistance in the garden department.< /review>

Manangment and customer service is TERRIBLE. They need some serious training or they should be replaced.
We ordered a door from them that we had to cancel after A MONTH because they screwed up so many times. Ended up in our favor. GO TO CAL WINDOWS AND DOOR in downtown Ventura, much better service, and selection.

Round 2: Ordered decking materials to be delivered Friday, after some confusion, they assured us Saturday, and now we won’t get them until Sunday.

IF YOU ARE ON A TIMELINE, DON’T USE THIS LOWES. This is our third project that they have delayed because of poor communication and disorganization. Thank god we don’t have a contractor involved.<//Text>

< review>
It saddens me that a store I used to get excited about going to,  now fills me with disappointment when I hear the name. Bought a shower door that someone returned and parts were missing.  Frame was cut. This happened twice in a row. Drove from Santa Barbara  to Ventura. Then with the second one There was no way I was driving all way back to Ventura again I'm on the clock time is money. So I asked them when they made a delivery could they just pick it up and take it and they wanted to charge me a $90 fee. So I had to call corporate in order to get the shower door picked up at no cost. Then I was in Ventura doing a plumbing job, I'm just a Fix-It person is not a plumber. So I needed a valve for a faucet and I wasnt sure which one. Waited a half hour and 3 people came and I knew more than they did..
Ok once I get, twice it happens. But three people, three trips. Three separate instances. I'm done giving them chances</review>

Worst customer service I have ever experienced.  You could wander around in this place for hours, even days, looking like your lost, and you will never get a customer service agent to ask you if you need help. Been there, done that. They will walk right past you looking like they are busy or on a mission. Home Depot in Oxnard is no better. Go to either one only if you know what you want but don't expect to get any help.< /Review>

Horrible. Took 40 minutes to get a salesperson. Then he proceeded to take the man first. I called salesperson on it and he called me a liar. Then he refused to serve me. Had to call a manager for help..another 20 minutes. Needless to say...I WILL NOT SHOP AT YOUR VENTURA STORE AGAIN!</Text>

<Review>Horrible.  I ordered flooring and was told it would arrive within a week.  It's now 3 weeks later and nothing.  Every time I go to check the status I'm told it will be there on Friday. Just got off the phone and they said that the order is still not sent.  Can't move in to my first house cause I'm waiting on the flooring.  Horrible experience, will never use again.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Everytime I try to call I can never get anyone to pick up the phone. Have waited up to more than an hour to get my questions answered. Very unprofessional. I'll take my business to Home Depot. Answered in 3 rings! Don't waste your time at this place</Review>

Terrible customer service, rude employee. Contacted corporate and got called back from store. They were apologetic about the terrible treatment we received. Chris told me if I ever wanted to come back they'd do what they could to make up for the issue. Well 3 days later I need to replace a door and want a pet door installed in it. They have the door and they have the pet door we wanted in Stock. Called and spoke to Christy, told her about the situation, the treatment and since they wanted to make it up to us if they could install the pet door onto the entry door after I purchased them. Nope, not possible I'd need to hire a contractor or special order a door......thanks for the accommodation! Not. So thanks to this store we will now be canceling our Lowes credit card through them and now be exclusive home depot shoppers. Thank you Christy and Chris for the empty promises of making it up to us.<//Text>

It's  big box chain with poor quality items, profits leave the community and employee wages low. Unfortunately there aren't many, if any, local hardware stores left around here any longer thanks to places like Lowe's. I hate going there and the only other option is Home Depot in Oxnard. Can't recommend either.<//text>

<review>Closest alternative hardware store to besides Osh and HD in Santa Barbara.  I prefer this Lowe's to the HD in Santa Barbara.  The store is more organized and carries a good selection of products not always found in other stores.  I have never interacted with the staff so I can't comment on that.</review></record>

< review>
Lowes has a 90-day refund policy for most of what they sell. We purchased custom window blinds through them. Lowes doesn't make custom blinds themselves, they job it out to 1 of 3 outside vendors, in our case, Bali. The Bali blinds are very poorly constructed and started to fall apart within 1 week of use. Unfortunately, this happened more than 90 days after we purchased them, because the room was being remodeled, and the blinds sat unwrapped in their boxes while the remodel was being finished. Lowes acknowledged the actual timing of use, and even acknowledged that the blinds were poorly constructed, but stuck to their policy anyway and offered not one penny of refund for a very expensive purchase that we're now stuck with. Much as I like Lowes for convenience & selection, I cannot shop there again or recommend them to anyone, especially not for anything custom-made from the flooring or wall covering depts.< /review>

Drove all the way from Santa Paula, had to wait in the store for over 20 minutes for someone who could cut the wood, and then was rudely told by the employee that he could only make a single cut to fit it into a car and that they did not offer cutting to size even though I was told they would on the phone less than an hour before.<//review>< Date>

We do not regularly shop at Lowe's because it is normally not convenient, but last weekend we did shop there for items needed for our new home (after a very disappointing experience with a competitor) oh shall remain unnamed). On Sunday, my boyfriend left an item outside on a table where he had stopped for some lunch. He called and asked that it if anyone turned it in I could stop on my way back from LA, but we felt that it was a long-shot, since it was decorative. On June 26 at 5:15 PM I checked at Customer Service and talked to a very nice woman who was very sympathetic. The item had not been turned in and she called a manager to see what could be done for me.  The manager said I could just go get another one - a $25 item. I do not know her name nor the manager's but Lowe's has certainly earned our return business with their customer service. Thank you!< /Text>

Consistently BAD customer service at this store, and I am there at least once a week. If you can actually "capture" someone to help you...chances are they will have a terrible attitude or treat you like you are an unwelcome guest.</review>
