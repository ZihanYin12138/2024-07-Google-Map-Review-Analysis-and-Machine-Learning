<Review>The staff was friendly and knowledgeable of their products. My oil was changed and all of my fluids were checked including the battery charge status. They didn't try to up sale me on anything. The environment was smoke free and well kept. Awesome team with or without the manager onsite.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Disappointed in service. Had to remind guy to do things. Seemed like they were in a hurry to do nothing,  since I was last customer.  Wasn't worth the price. Not going here anymore with new management on board.< /Review>

<Text>YOU STAY IN THE VEHICLE WHILE THEY WORK ON IT.  I cannot express how nice this is. If you go to some other places, their mechanics will hop inside your car and I'm pretty sure make it greasy on the steering wheel and the shifter and mark up the sheep carpets, not here.

This place is awesome. I will be back.

Shout out to Sebastián and Francisco. These guys know what their doing and doing it great.

I appreciate that they even have protocols for covid safety in place.</Text>< Date>

Came here to get the work box truck serviced. Came and got an oil change done quickly before departing to Sacramento for the day. The service was quick and efficient. I thoroughly enjoyed my wait time while the truck got worked on. The staff here are super friendly and high energy, I had a good time. Would definitely  come back here for any vehicle maintenance so long as their prices are reasonable.<//review>

Tried to double charge me for my transmission service.
Showed a $170 charge for "ATF fluid exchange" and two lines down the bill, another $170 charge for "automatic transmission fluid exchange".

ATF is an abbreviation for Automatic Transmission Fluid.
Scammers.
When I told employee at register gave me deer in headlights look and tried to delete charge multiple times while I watched and ended up having to call a different employee to delete the extra charge.

I am not from hayward I am fairly new to the area my car was impounded and I had just got it back and wanted to check my fluids and look under my vehicle for leaks they told me they would if I was an existing customer which I am but in a different city and they were not able to find me in there system so they turned me away cause I wouldn't pay for an oil change for them to even touch my car. I have never had worse service at an oil place in my life will never spend my money with them anywhere again not even in my own city after this.</Text>

Website states closes at 7pm arrived at 6:09pm to be turned away employee who was professional stated daylight saving ect no overtime ect closed. I tried calling several times to complain however employee answered so I was given District Mgrs number. Giving ZERO stars.  If you close at 6pm then the doors should have been closed. However they were open all lights on, obviously no one checks the websites for true hours.</Text>

I tried to go to a different place and the new place told me Jiffy Lube left the filter too tight and they didn't want to be liable if they damage my car... I went back paid more, but at least they were really polite and helpful. Note: It wasn't the ladies that left my old filter to tight that the other oil place didn't want to service me.< /Text>< username>

<rate>1</rate><text>I went in at 1:30 on Sunday. The store hours say this place is open 9-4. At 1:30 I was told by a lady that everyone is on lunch and to come back later.  Not in the friendliest way either. Really? So store hours are 9-1 and then 2-4?
I went back at 2:10, and the same person who told me to come back was the person helping me. Once again, not the friendliest person. There was another guy helping her that seemed more professional and competent. But he wasn't who I dealt with so the review stand at 1 star.

Also, they didn't check my tire pressure. I don't need my fluids checked but my tire pressure is important to me and they skipped that part.

The store owner needs to spend time at the store to see what's going on.  It seems like bunch if children are running the place.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1513701555153, 'text': 'Our team is surprised with what you described, as it does not reflect the values we aim to deliver.

<review>Dear Colleagues,
This Jiffy Lube business location at 153 Jackson St., Hayward, CA 94544 was listed in a recent neighborhood flyer advertising an oil change coupon for 22.99
When I stopped in on Saturday, May 21, 2016 at 2:30 p.m. to redeem the coupon and get an oil change, the employees (an older man and a young woman) refused to honor the valid coupon when presented at the store.
Employees fabricated two different lies saying that the coupon instead was for a different savings of 15% that did not agree with the advertised price of 22.99, making the final price 26.99.  They also tried to ignore the coupon totally and charge the full price of 37.99 for the oil change.
If the location's address was not listed on the flyer, it could be said that they are not participating, BUT their address was boldly listed, so I do not see any reason for them not to honor it (It expires 8/31/16).
Is this a bait and switch scenario?<//review>< Pics>

<Text>very bad service... pay for full oil change service this includes inspection of several points, which they did not do, when I paid for the service they charged me the wrong car bill; I replaced the air filter for one of poor quality that had to go to buy at a cost of 9 dlls and I was charged in 21 ... and all this in almost two hours it took to finish.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I don't wanna write a lot, but wanna give you the biggest time saving tip of your life time, DO NOT go to this place you will regret it, the crew has awful  attitude specially when supervisor is not around (mostly). at the top of that they clean your window with a dirty and oily rag that leaves you with a lot of issues when you use your windshield wipers. no one takes charge when supervisor is not around and if you wanna know how long you have to wait?! they say "take a seat and some one will help you" and that some one will not come to help you unless you chase every single one of then till you get your answer. Believe! me this is not a one time experience, it happens to me over and over.</Review>

I went in for a basic oil change & was an employee by the name of Salamon tried to charge me $103.00 . I have a 2003 Cadillac... who in their right mind would pay that!! My service included oil change , all my other fluids checked & topped off, windshield washer fluid,& tire pressure check. I asked prior to leaving was everything done ,& was told yes. Only to discover once I was on the freeway that there was no washer fluid whatsoever in the car , nor had my tires had any air put in them.< /Review>

Four days after getting my oil change here my oil light came on.  I also noticed on my paperwork that my transmission and power steering fluid level was ok, but I checked my fluid levels and they were very low.  I went back to the store and spoke with a manager and he told me to bring my car back and they will change my oil filter and oil again.

I am happy that they were willing to service my car again free of charge but I am displeased with the fact that the tech lied about my car transmission and power steering levels.  This shows me that you all are not truly checking all of the fluid levels and therefore are falsifying company documents and lying to your customers.  VERY SAD THING.< /review>

i'm giving 5 stars because this crew went the extra mile for me and installed a headlamp that was giving me trouble to put in. They installed the headlamp even though it was a pain in the butt.  The environment here is fun; the crew was at one point joking around with each other and laughing really hard; made my day :)<//Text>

Last time I was here they left the oil filter under the hood and a tool. Today December 22 I’ve been here 30 minutes watching other cars come and go. I just hope they put the right oil in this time. I will change my oil myself from now on.!!!< /Text>

<Review>Liars, they said my car doesn't have a transmission filter so their job is as good as anyone else's. Just found out they lied to me because the dealer said I need to change the filter or I'll have damage. Never going to a jiffy lube ever again. They ripped me off and lied.</Review>< pics>

This was a quick stop in. It's a really fun place to explore. The Plantation Dainties and the red arrow caught my eye today. I forgot to take a picture of the cute Winnie the Pooh items in another case.

On a crisp day or even better, a rainy one, this is a great spot. A little bakery is part giving you the chance to nosh a bit then browse 20,000 sq ft of nostalgia.

If you're like me, caught behind a screen often, this is a great way to break free, take a walk and find inspiration.

Prices all seemed really reasonable as well.</text>

<text>This place is great. It’s a huge antique store that is nicely organized and tidy, not like the messiness of other antique stores. They have some really great objects for sale and are negotiable on prices. The staff were so nice and helpful. Definitely worth a stop if your passing by.<//text>< pictures>

<review>135 different vendors, everything is clean and well merchandised, great music to shop by, nice bakery and coffee shop on premises. Grab a cup of coffee or tea and wander to your hearts content. We always find something we didn't know that we needed!

<review>The antique store is much larger on the inside than it appears. Each area inside is divided up into individual sellers, so if you're looking for something specific, you may need to look through the entire store. But there does seem to be a little something for everybody here. Prices vary from seller to seller, some more reasonable than others. But everyone can make their own judgment about what an antique is worth vs. their budget...</review>< Pictures>

I have been a return customer for years because I love this place so much.

They do not make things like they used to. It is such a joy to come here and see those delicately crafted items get a second, third, fourth life.

I love spending hours in here because you never know what you will find<//review>

<Text>This place was really nice! I was so impressed with how organized and clean each section/booth was. There was so much to see and a lot happening, but in the best way; the aisles flowed smoothly, and the atmosphere wasn't overwhelming. 😍 I found exactly what I wanted (end tables) and more (owl pins)! I'm a very happy customer, I will tell my friends about this place, and I will be returning!💕</Text>< Pictures>

The variety, and quality, are astounding! A decorator's delight! Really appreciate that the aesthetic movement (my favorite) is always well-represented. Have found some great things here ~ in my opinion, the best antique shop in wine country.</Text>

In this world of on line shopping it's nice to have a place where you can spend a couple hours just browsing and actually see what you are buying. Let's keep the little guys in business!<//text>

Always interesting large co-op antique venue,  wide variety of items for almost every interest.  I have very specific interests in British and American historical items and find very few places I have been able to find items to buy, but I never leave here without something, usually several items   Nice people to deal with.< /text>

I will be going back here to shop.  they had a lot of items at great prices and less hassle of crowds .  very nice to discover this diamond in the city.  this was not a typical off price dollar store This is a well maintained local well rounded product store. Much worth going to!!!!< /Review>< pictures>

Good place for a quick stop, to pick up something needed. A little over priced, for the same things you can get at the 99¢ store. They sell filtered water here, self serve for .20¢ the gallon, clean and good tasting.</Text>

Didn't even want to give it a star the owner is so rude and bitter thinks everyone is stealing. He always stares when I go in there and today was the last time I will be shopping there saying my daughter ripped a stupid flower off the headband said now you pay for it.</Review>

Waited over 2 hrs in waiting room! The Doctor on duty had no level of time balance with patience. Only 1 Doctor per 10 people. Got passed up from a patient who had a workers comp claim. Clearly this practice has no sense of professionalism or consideration.</review>

Do not read the negative reviews...

On my vacation, my eye became infected (conjunctivitis) and required immediate attention. I arrived at 7.30am as they opened. The front desk person was extremely courteous and provided all the necessary log in materials.

Immediately following the completion of the forms, I was brought into a treatment room, where a physician's aide took my vitals. She told me the Doctor would be right in. A few minutes later, the Doctor came in and proceeded to examine my eye as well as asking a few questions regarding allergies. She was extremely knowledgeable and explained the course of treatment. I felt I was in good hands.

A prescription was printed and I was on the road to recovery...

I could not have been more comfortable and pleased with the treatment I received. Do not hesitate to use their services... They are terrific.< /review>

<text>Second visit and very satisfied. they are quick to get to you, listen to what you have to say, and do their best to make sure you’re comfortable even if a procedure isn’t the most pleasant. They remembered me from last time and were very pleasant. Not sure why they have such bad ratings based on my two experiences.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>I've been here a total of two times. The first time I was seen by an older gentleman who was very nice, professional, kind, and incredibly helpful. I had come down with a virus but I wasn't sure since I had strep for three months straight due to a resistance to anti biotics and wanted to make sure that it hadn't resurfaced after a terrible experience with the illness.

The second time I went I was seen by an older lady, she was very skinny, and the most unprofessional doctor I have ever been seen by. I was tired and laid down on the bench in the private room. She came through the door and barked at me to get up, no greeting, no kind hello. I'm a quiet individual and was alarmed by the instruction so I sat up quickly and didn't say anything. She told me I probably had the flu, asked me if I had gotten the shot this year, and then laughed at my response. My boyfriend was in the room and tried to comfort me from her remarks. She comes back after testing me for the flu via the nose swab, she refuses to make eye contact and says I have a virus but to make sure to get the flu shot this year (I'm guessing so I don't have to waste her time?). I asked her if I could have a doctors note for work that day, as I had stayed home to rest from my 101.8 fever (just below the recommended temp for an IV treatment) and she glared at me before reluctantly giving me the note, promptly letting me know I need to go back to work the next day.  I thanked her kindly for her help, she didn't even acknowledge me and then left the room.

I understand it's the medical field and not customer service, but being rude to a patient just because? Also, since when is a medical professional allowed to blame the patient for being sick with a virus/assume it's the flu and guilt the patient without test results?

I will not be coming back here.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>I waited for 2 hours to get into the check room. When I got there a few minutes later a Dr. (older woman) came over and asked if your leg hurt. You have to go to emergency room in the hospital to check. She thanked and walked out. She’s loud and uses high tone. It was very rude. I didn’t have chance to ask any question that I concern. I thought I had problem with my manager in the office. Did I have to pay any charge for this visit anyone? Thanks</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I have used urgent care a lot over the last 15 or more years and found the facility quite helpful. Recently, however, the place has turned into a nightmare for folks seeking minor medical care. I went in to get checked for an UTI and was told the wait would be 2 to 3 hours. I then asked if I could wait outside in my car and come back in after almost two hours. I was told I needed to fill out their paperwork before I could do that, and that the paperwork would be out in a few moments. Thirty minutes later I asked about the paperwork and was told it would take 40 more minutes to get the paperwork. When I asked whether I could fill out the paperwork when I came back I was told that would then be my check-in time. It appeared they just wanted to confine me in the crowded wait room.

This is very bad, considering during my earlier visits the receptionist could check my insurance and give me the paperwork, all as I checked in.<//Text>

Just wanted to get a blood test for yearly medicine, it took one hour to be seen and I was the only one waiting. That place has really gone down.< /Text>

<text>I was worried about going here from the reviews, but this small clinic was great. Friendly staff and the doctor who helped me was nice and knowledgeable. While the follow up care is very limited, I don't think you can expect much more from an urgent care clinic.< /text>< pics>

The worst experience in a medical facility. Needed stitches. Front office was rude and acted like you weren't there while you stood at the desk waiting to check in. The medical assistant was completely unqualified and unpacked the sterile suture kit and left it on the tray while we waited for an hour and a half for the Dr to come in. The next medical assistant was very curt and rude and wouldn't look at you just barked out what she wanted to know. They were not busy but took us 3 hours to get stitches. Bill was almost $1,000.00. Then they tell me I have to come back and have it checked in 2 days and pay again. Then come back for stitch removal and pay again. We are now at the office for the 2 day check and have been sitting here 2 hours with no Dr. Yet. If I could give zero stars I would. Never again.</text>

I don't think they have doctors here at the moment, only NP and PAs. Still waiting... nobody checks in. Don't recommend this place.

Edit: Just to be fair: I later learned that they had an urgent surgery going on at that time thus couldn't tend to other patients.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>Absolutely the worst care a person could ask for.  While 6 people wait in the waiting room for more than 1.5 hours, a total of 2 patients are seen. The unreal lack of care in this place is obvious and the staff is rude as can be when questioned about long wait times. 3 hours or more in this office which is supposed to provide "urgent care" in place of the hospital which also has ridiculous wait times. There are absolutely no positives to this facility and could o have given them ZERO stars I likely would have. I came in for a cold and sadly for those with worse conditions they have to wait just as long or longer.  The question still is, where is Patient Care when you need it?</review>< Pictures>

Long story short they missed a SIMPLE diagnosis that I had even mentioned  I suspected Despite my concern about a specific injury they never looked for that injury and instead did x-rays. They sent us home with no answerd and after 4 days we still didn't have the radiology report. We went to our pediatrician and it turns out it was exactly the injury I suspected, the x-rays were unnecessary.  I am disappointed that given the type of injury and the behaviour my son displayed that the diagnoses didn't happen while we were here instead my 2 year old walked around in pain for 4 additional days.</Text></record>

< Review>
They turned my 3 year old away today who had tripped and smacked his forehead pretty forcefully into the sidewalk a couple blocks from their office and was in a lot of pain.  We were concerned that he might have a concussion.  They wouldn't see him and said we should go to the emergency room even after I explained that our car was parked 2 miles away.  Didn't even call a nurse or doctor to take a look at him, which floored me.  My mistake, I thought "urgent care" (and for that matter "care") was right in their name.  My son is fine by the way, but they're dead to me.

Update: and now that I'm thinking about it, the one other time we took our son there for a flu/cold, they suggested giving him cold medication which the American Academy of Pediatrics explicitly recommends against for young children.< /Review>

Fairly prompt &, due to the nature of our visit, referred us to CHOMP (nearby hospital). If you are on your cell phone (even if you're a family member & not the patient) you will be asked by the doctor to put it away, so I suggest doing that beforehand.< /review>

I went in as soon as they opened at 7:30. Service was prompt however the medical provider Christine Russell wasn't the best of physicians or pa's. She didn't introduce herself or say much. I had a very bad sinus infection and she was just going to give me two pills of amoxicillian for the sore throat. When I advised her that doctors have given me that in the past and it didn't work she didn't seem happy with me. I work in the medical field and their level of care here is mediocre and not persobalable at all. Probably will go elsewhere next time. I am grateful to them however for seeing me in a timely manner.<//Text>

Good care, very caring nursing staff. I recommend you get a copy of all results, including (especially?) a CD of any xrays: I was told the xrays would be sent out (to CHOMP, a local hospital) for a radiologist's reading, but neither was this done nor did they send it when asked again over a week later. Certainly, Doctors can do basic xray reads, but Radiologists should do the final report, something that never happened.< /review>

< review>
The worst medical experience I have ever had. Brought my girlfriend (my gf is a medical assistant) there with a severe sinus infection. The staff were rude, mumbled and then got mad when they couldn't be heard. Worth a swollen ear they jabbed her with an ear thermometer and then called her out for flinching. Then they underprescribed the WRONG antibiotic and my gf basically had to tell them what to prescribe. Never in my life have I dealt with medical practitioners this incompetent. You'd be better off getting medical advice from a hobo under a bridge. Go anywhere else, or save your time and money and go on WebMD, ten minutes on that website and you'll know more about medicine than these idiots.<//review>

I went to the doctor for a nail problem and waiting in the waiting room for a hour and a half with only 5 people waiting. Then got admitted into a room waiting another full hour before a Nurse practitioner came for a 20 second talk and had attitude about rinsing it and that she  won't do the nessesary steps because she doesn't believe it should happen.<//Review>

<review>When you hear Pacific Palisades all we can moot is that it’s the creme de la creme of views of the pacific ocean, cliffs and canyons. Palisades Bluffs Park is a small park in Pacific Palisades that offers impeccable view of the ocean and the coastal highway. It sits on a cliff overlooking the palisades residential area. Moreover, it has a modicum of concrete benches and trees. The highlight of my visit was when I saw a young deer down the cliff grazing the lush green bushes. It wasn’t crowded at all when I visited. Parking is available in the surrounding neighborhood. Overall, I think it’s a modest park with magnificent ocean view. I highly recommend you visit this park.<//review>< rating>

<Date>1587855923192</Date><Rate>5</Rate><Text>Just a gorgeous morning above PCH. It's a beautiful view with morning mist. There is opportunity for a short walk and see all the beauty what mother nature offers. The best time to go, my experience,  is around 10 am. You can still see the mist, burns up a bit, and starts fog in (12 noon?). The slopes are steep so stay on track. Enjoy it along with  neighborhood flowers.< /Text>< Pics>

Beautiful view! The road is blocked so you need to park your car and walk to the small park along the bluff.</Review>

As is the case with much of my travels, I found this place accidentally while randomly exploring the Palisades. I believe I personally enjoy this space because the scenery and views of the coastline and mountains from the Bluffs are insane and almost dramatic, like I'm in a primetime soap opera like Knots Landing and the neighbors meet at The Bluffs for a secret rendezvous or a cliffhanger-style (pun intended) confrontation. It would be cool to be a resident in this neighborhood just for the chances to hang out here on a regular basis.<//review>

She stood up on the rail facing pch.... and as I held her by her hips, I told her to spread her arms and close her eyes....

She felt like one of the birds of the sky soaring above the Pacific ocean from Malibu to R.A.T. Beach.... She climbed down from the rail and into my arms.... And then it was my turn.  I flew too.

<Text>(Translated by Google) My favorite place for a Pic-Nic with a spectacular view, very calm, and not very popular, so most of the time you will feel that the whole place is just for you. If you stay at sunset, you will achieve spectacular photos. One observation is that there is a lot of wind, so look good shelters @

Mi lugar favorito para un Pic-Nic con una vista espectacular, muy calmado, y no muy popular, así que la mayoría del tiempo sentirás que el lugar entero es solo para ti. Si te quedas a la caída del sol lograrás fotos espectaculares. Una observación es que hay mucho viento, así que ve bien abriga@< /Text>< pics>

I've come here twice now and I love the quality of my nails.  They also care about overall nail health and give you tips on what to do at home, which I really appreciate.
Both my manicurist have been both wonderful artists and good company.  They are fantastic!   They prefer you paying cash.  So have some on you when before you go.<//Review>

I can’t even fathom with this place. Don’t even bother spending your money here! I asked for a simple fill (priced at $20), the lady racked up other services WITHOUT MY PERMISSION and tried to charge me double than the price listed. Additionally, the basic fill shouldn’t have taken long, when in actuality it took ALMOST THREE HOURS. Don’t waist your money and time here. Take your business somewhere else!< /Text>

<review>Don't bother.  They cut my little toe doing a basic pedicure for mother's day! I was shocked and it hurt. Also, not great customer service, mediocre painting job by the elderly guy who did my feet, and really lame foot massage when that's what I wanted to be good b/c my feet hurt running after a toddler all day. Pick another place, people! Don't waste your money.< /review><Resp>None</Resp>< time>

I have been coming to Pro Nails for the past year almost 2 years and have always had a good experience! I also call ahead and schedule an appointment because they get busy. Tom the owner does my nails and i am always happy with his work! I get many compliments on my nails and i refer people here all the time.<//Review>

<review>Do not... I repeat.. DO NOT get your nails done here. I’m actually disgusted and disappointed. The underside of my nails look filthy, and I even have a cut on my right index finger. I asked them if they could do a certain design BEFORE they stared and they said yes. After they had the nails on they told me they couldn’t do that design. Basically tricking me into paying $40 for nails that I didn’t even want.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Horrible treatment! Waited with my Birthday granddaughter to her her toes and finger nails done for her birthday present. I made the mistake of walking into this place of rudeness. No hello, no we will be with you soon. We left after 30 minutes of no one saying anything to us. We don't mind waiting but say something to let us know you will be helping us. 🙄😡</Text>

I’m never coming here again. Very bad service and they put something on my nail that burned very badly and they were extremely rough with my nails compared to other places I’ve been. They guy that did my nails dented the nail polish after and looked at the dent showed the lady next to him and did nothing about it when he was still able to fix it. I’ve been here before and also had very bad service so I will not be coming back.< /Text>

There was no one in the nail shop and still took 2 hours to do nails.  Way to Slow. Plus he didn't want to do them the way I wanted to do them I'm the one paying 50$/ Not him. I should do them the way I want.< /text>

Worst place EVER I will not be coming to this place ever again!!! They were so rough on my nails they were bleeding the whole time and the guy did not care at all!!he complained about how short I wanted my nails!  He stopped to pick his teeth with a tooth pick while doing my nails! My nails are super bumpy and are in so much pain! WORST PLACE EVER I can't believe I paid to get my nails done and they ended up looking like a 3 year old did them!<//Review>

<review>I ordered takeout recently, and this restaurant doesn’t get more than 2.5 stars. Sure some of their food is tasty, but the quality and quantity are severely lacking. Don’t get any “prawns!” What they call prawns are actually tiny shrimp that are uncleaned and full of sh!t in every bite. Disgusting. Also, i ordered a large seafood Tom Yum Soup, but they just added more broth to a small-medium portion. Did they think i wouldn’t notice? I don’t get it. Taste is important, but so are quality and quantity. Very disappointing. I’ll def look elsewhere when I want Thai food.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Sri Thai is my favorite local Thai restaurant by far. Their pumpkin curry so damn scrumptious it will blow your mind. I wish I could munch it every day for the rest of my life. The lunch special is a good deal and comes with some tasty soup and salad. The service is excellent. Everyone who works there is very friendly. Other dishes such as spicy tofu basil, pad thai, cashew chicken, etc. are also yummy as hell. But don't sleep on the pumpkin curry.< /Text>

Just alright. Not thing to write home about, and nothing to wanna come back to. The complimentary lunch soup is a hot and sour soup, which reminds you of a chinese restaurant, rather than your typical coconut soup. My husband got the lunch red curry with pork, it comes with rice and salad. The salad has a sweet mayo based dressing, which is typical of your chinese cold appetizer sweet mayo glaze (like the fried sweet mayo prawn dish). Hubby ordered his red curry with Medium spice, and it was good. My pad kee mao (spicy flat rice noodle) with beef was not spicy enough, and i had to request additional chillies to add. My noodle dish came with the same side salad.< /review>

Pad Thai and Basil Fried Rice are supposed to be the most basic dishes that you cannot go wrong with. And Sri Thai was not upto the mark. Basil Thai Fried rice lacked Basil and PadThai was undercooked. Chicken was very dry and they didn't give complimentary chilli sauce. Pad Thai did not have the pad thai noodles, it was some thick chowmein.
The food at this place is a joke as of January 2020< /text>

<Review>I have gone to some many Thai restaurants through the country this is the worst I've been. The customer service was terrible, the server had an attitude, not helpful to decide what good to order, I stuck to the classic Pad Thai thinking that one was a sure shot, food lack flavor, salt and taste. Presentation was nice but not worthy to go back again specially with the attitudes on the place.< /Review></record>

A good place to indulge in Thai comfort food. Menu also includes some Asian fusion dishes mostly from neighboring Southeast Asian cultures. Their Pad Thai is the bomb, it is a must try. Seafood lovers will love this place. While they serve chicken, pork, and shrimp, there are vegetarian options on the menu. Portions are huge and prices are decent.</Review>

<Review>Ordered from here for the first time via Ubereats. The Ubereats driver grabbed the wrong order and when I called the restaurant they fixed the problem right away and delivered the correct meal to my house.
The order I got by mistake was delicious and the food I intentionally ordered was delicious as well.

Specifically:
•the egg in the dishes is really good
•My brother says they have the best Thai Iced Tea he’s ever had

Will definitely be ordering from here again!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Authentic Red curry. Very flavorful n delicious. Lot of vegetarian options. Good ambience. Quiet place. Small sitting area. Can get crowded during peak hrs. Service was ok, nothing exceptional. The decor n Thai heritage is brought out very beautifully with statues n photos yet kept modern. Good portion size. Though rice n noodles are separetly charged as side dishes. Vegetables are fresh and cooked to absolute perfection.</Review>< pictures>

We are sad to not be traveling to the San Francisco Bay Area every month... mostly because we see this restaurant as our home base of operations when we are here. The staff is incredible, they know us by site and by order. We wish we could pick your place up and relocate it to our backyard! We love eating here!! Enjoy the food, the atmosphere, the friendly staff, and a full tummy!< /text>< Pics>

This is my go to lunch spot in the Pleasanton Dublin area. Food is outstanding. Coffee is delicious. The wait can be a bit much, but totally worth the wait.< /Review>

Their food is outstanding!!!  Seafood in a clay pot is my favorite.  My wife's favorite is their special  eggplant dish.  The service is always good.  They check in at your table from time to time but overall leave you be so that you can enjoy the food.</text>

Good quality / price value, with generous servings and a selection that can accommodate the taste of many with meat and vegetables, tofu and fish, different choices of spiciness. Quite good at accommodating large parties if booked in advance.</Text>

<text>We like the prawn curry but with tofu -;) instead of prawn
Not sure how we ended up with this one but they are quite friendly from what I know

He may not talk much but that’s cause he is very busy . No intentions of being rude

<review>The service was exceptionally horrible today.
I have been to this place a few times, but today , New Years Day, was totally unexpected.
The woman waitress in her 50’s , short, round face, was rude from the moment we sat down.  It took 15 minutes to take our order.  When we ordered plain noodles for our daughter , she could not think outside the box and just do a side of plain noodles, she charged us full price for a noodle dish on the menu, which contains meat, veggies, & egg.  She made no mention of the price , and then started shouting at us when we asked her why we were charged $12 for a side of plain noodles.  She said “nobody has ever complained that they have to pay full price” which I have no idea what it had to do with us & our problem.  She made a face at us :(  , literarily the worst sad smile I have ever seen, and was babbling about us behind the counter.  I approached her and told her we didn’t want to fight, but rather we were concerned about being charged for a complete dish.  She began to shout again, said “fine, ok , Happy New Year!”  I really wish I had recorded her behavior, it was really appalling.  I’m not desperate to go here again, even for the food or the fact that I live near, just because they were so shockingly rude!!!!  **customers beware that they slap all sorts of charges on and automatically charged 15% gratuity on the bill , even though there was no mention or disclaimer of it on the bill or menu. **</review><gmapID>0x808fe94b7cdbac29:0x93dd131a03d4d188</gmapID>< Name>

<review>Food is good. Service is ok. We went their for lunch few times. Our experience was good until the last occasion where service could have been better. We were not happy and were dissatisfied with the way they could not take our order correctly. Any way food quality is not bad actually.</review>< Pics>

Overpriced and not Thai. Atleast not Thai welcoming.  Way too much for what yiu get. And i agree with another quality. Prices gone up and up for the same old thing. I end up just leaving and going to Bangkok 101. @dub. They seem nicer. One male employee lied to me and told me their prices have not gone . i am not a fool. I watch prices and been going there longer than he has been there after a decade in the tri valley eating. Sad.< /review>

<review>this is absolutely the worse thai food I have ever had.
We ordered Tom Yum soup, Pad See Ew and Eggplant Basil Chicken

Here is how the food tasted
Tom Yum - nothing like tom yup.... weird sort of spice, every sip had crushed red chillies in it... that tasted like dirt

Pad See Ew - looked like it was glaced on top like how you typically see Donuts... was too sweet, seemed like there was sugar added and was very bad... whoever ate it had stomach ache later that evening...

Eggplant Basil with chicken - I have never seen minced chicken in this dish... but from outside it looked like a soup rather than a dish...

the only thing that tasted ok was the brown rice (that doesn't come with the dish)

will never have it again< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< review>
Cracker barrel is not set up for wheel chair access. My friend who is in a mechanical wheel chair came in was treated rudely saying I did not know you were in a wheelchair... They did not have the room to accommodate such large wheelchairs as these.  We felt rushed and in the way trying to enjoy the meal. Never again. Heads up to the disabled community. You will leave feeling bad.< /review>

<review>So after waiting years and years common California finally gets a Cracker Barrel restaurant! I just love this restaurant and gift shop comment we are from the sound where they are plenty out there. So it was refreshing to see country food now in California, which is where we reside. Be sure if you stopped in there to get some of their homemade biscuits with white Sawmill gravy, and the Marion blackberry jam is to die for! Also in the gift shop oh, they have a nostalgic candy area and a nostalgic toy area it's a really neat thing to see, candy from your past as well as toys! I've never had anything bad at any Cracker Barrel location oh, so I think this location is going to do just fine. The staff were friendly the lines were long but the wait time was sufficient. I would definitely recommend this if you're passing through the high desert. Also they have just finished their second California location in Rialto California!<//review></record>

The food is just so so most of the time.  Not great, not bad.  Unique environs is main reason to go.   Today was a Disastsr.  Served both of us wrong meals then said were out of our order so served us their choice or someone else's order, don't know.   My medium eggs were stone cold and done easy.  Manager did remove one meal off the check but breakfast experience was ruined by that time.  They blamed kitchen as having a bad day.  Bad form to make flimsy excuses.  The server who brought us the order and made the excuse was ultimately the person responsible for the order being served  correct.<//text>

Yummy carnitas burritos and street tacos. Has serve yourself frozen yogurt too. One of our favorite places to go. I had the shrimp zucchini boat tonight and boy was it delicious. Nice, friendly counter service. We're lucky to have this place to go to up here on the divide<//Text>

Stop by on my way home and dined in having a combo plate of enchilada, taco with some chips and salsa and flushed it down with a light beer.  Prices are good and the personnel are great.  Especially like talking to the table guy "Bob" who has a lot of knowledge of the local area and people.</Text>

<Text>Really amazing food and wonderful service, the staff are friendly and hardworking. I spend all day looking forward to getting mouth watering tacos. The baja fish and chicken street tacos (I add her green sauce to mine YUM!!) are my favorite things on the menu. Absolutely delicious! Support local!!</Text><date>1616035777264<//date>< UserId.>

Some of the best Mexican food in the area hands down. I’ve been going here a few years now, and I’m normally a very happy customer. There is the occasional off day, I’ll grant them that, but it’s just two people mainly running the place with a couple employees. I feel like everyone is due there off day. Food is always super fresh and made to order and the lady’s running the joint are very pleasant. As a long time local, it’s definitely a treat at a reasonable price, and I hope they stay for a long long time.</Text>

I celebrated my graduation yesterday in this fine place. I am glad to say that it was a brilliant evening and the venue was unquestionably the reason for the outstanding celebration. The crew  participated in a splendid style, the meals were very good and my friends were so  cheerful. We shall definitely come back again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.</Text>

We decided to go all Mexican for Christmas this year. We ordered beans,  rice, tamales, and churros. The tamales and churros were the standouts. The pork tamales were the ones to brag about. Delicious. Very unassuming little place in downtown Cool California.< /review>

Best Mexican in Cool. What makes it the best? The owners truly care about the clients. For me, I want to spend my dollar where they remember me the second time I come in and say hello with the smile on their face.   The care for the clients also shows in the quality of the food.  Some of the items are prepared differently than I am accustomed, but that variety is what I like.<//text>

The food is always good.
The employees are very nice.
If they make a mistake on your order, they are very good at making it right.
They are always willing to make something custom or off menu for you. (provided you can tell them specifically what you want)
I love the place.<//review>

This is a great place to drop in.  My hubby and I have special food requirements, and the staff are very accommodating. More important, everything is delicious, and the kids can find options they like too. They added froyo and that's really good too. The people care, which you can tell by the steady flow of customers coming in and out of the building.</Text>

The beef burrito i ordered for lunch was larger than I anticipated, and tasted better than I'd hoped. I'm on the road a lot of the time and I'll make it a point to make it a regular stop when I'm in the area. Good food,  reasonable priced, and quick excellent customer service</Review>

Stopped in for dinner. They charge extra for chips and salsa, and the salsa wasn't that good. Had a chili verde burrito. It was just OK. Took quite awhile to get our meals. Not sure if I would stop in again.</Text>

Got enchilada plate yesterday.  Beans wete runny and blah...rice nothing to write home about.  Chicken enchiladas were small, but the worst was the green saice...like watery salsa with little flavor.  I want to like support locals, but no can do this place.<//review>

The service was decent. Had the brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was huge but mostly just ciabatta bun. The meat was a bit skimpy and totally flavorless. The sweet potato fries were superb.<//review>

Delicious diner food.  Great service and a perfect place to go with a family or if you have a wine hangover!  We loved it.  Plus the atmosphere is a lot of fun!</Review>

Food here was pretty good. Y wife had the chopped cobb, which was okay, but the blue cheese tasted a little weird.  The chicken club I got was really good, especially with a side of their honey mustard.  It seemed like they didn't have enough staff, so the wait was a little longer than I would have liked.  Overall it is a cheap option for breakfast or lunch if you are in the downtown Napa area.< /text>

Me: Oh baby! This steak, salad, onion rings, cornbread and green beans sure look good.

Wife: yeah they do. I can't wait to eat.

Me: Steak perfect. Food is so freaking good.

Wife: How about you hand over your wallet?

That's when I remembered that I'm not married and this person I've been talking to is actually a robber and here to take all my stuff. But this food is so good that I am totally disinterested in what's going on with said robber and after spacing off for a bit, thinking about what my steak could possibly be seasoned with, I came back to Earth and realized that my dog is now attacking said robber..........

Pepper is all I came up with in the end. Maaaaaaybe garlic salt. But that's because I ate this steak too fast and didn't really pay attention visually. Now I need to call the police to come clean up this robber's mess. Blood and hair everywhere.

Anyone know of a good stain remover?

Thank you for the great food Black Bear Diner</Text>

Wait time was long, staff attribute it to COVID restrictions on indoor dining capacity, but it appeared like they were just standing around most of the time; not professional.
Food was decent, for the price. I got a waffle with fruit, and my companion had the avocado toast. They were underwhelmed with their meal, but I enjoyed my meal with a few cups of Black Bear's coffee. We both got drinks and my friend got a side of potatoes. Came out to about $30.
I imagine that if COVID were not as much of a concern, this would have been a much better experience, which is why I gave this place 3 stars. But overall, I'd recommend you go to IHOP, just across the street, unless you want a sweet cream waffle.<//text>

Delicious food. Great service. 1st time at the Napa location. Togo. They got the order right and provided extra ketchup,  tartar sauce and even included fresh lemon and vinegar for my fish n' chips. Excellent job!< /Text>

<Review>This place was a nice break from the high falutin and often rowdy crowds of the wineries... The food was really good. The small portions "for seniors and light eaters" was still a lot of food for a decent price. They also have beer and wine.</Review>< user_id>

This was a terrible experience,  the food was severed cold,  the all you can eat fish, chips, coleslaw and hush puppies were a one time serving and they were out of hush puppies. I received a second order of fish to go and finally got the coleslaw to go as well. Even the normally delicious Bearclaws were sub par, no royal icing and barely any filling.  I was extremely disappointed,  normally Black Bear Diner is one of my favorites.</text>

Not as corny a restaurant as the name might suggest. The waitstaff both accommodating and efficient. I had a breakfast dish,...a variation on an Eggs Benedict, sans meat. My own special request. Our Server didn’t bat an eye! Food was delicious! And the portions were quite generous. The bill wasn’t too unreasonable. The only thing that I can say, and this is common in most restaurants, I found it a bit difficult to get the attention of the wait person, once the lunch crowd arrived.< /text>

My coffee cup had lipstick, and my plate had stains on it, from previous food because the dishes weren't washed right. BBD needs to do a better job on cleaning the dishes and the staff serving the food needs to work on their attention to detail. My hashbrowns were burnt.</text>

<review>A great little restaurant. They serve breakfast throughout the day as well as lunch and dinner options. There are salads available if you want to eat light or if you looking for a vegan snack and there's always highs for dessert.

Restaurants welcomes toddlers teens adults as well as aging adults it is handicapped accessible there are bathrooms for use parking is free and abundant I'm not sure if they allow service animals they're open from 6 a.m. till 10 p.m. I have found myself there on a number of occasions each time I'm greeted in a friendly manner most of them remember where I like to sit for what I like to drink I always find it clean the food cooked to order and the staff friendly.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQkOECusplaKgi24RW2CZhH6dzE5WkK9IWmCEd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH3FddQxmuAaN2kFVSgcXs51SVEwKmpV6vVfHg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvm-JbpG2TZUY-I7cV9XiGz0_-NUbS8EZnRlq2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPfi5gyyXEasfymfjFAXJ070rjt2BxUFwdVCtF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

I always love going to the Black Bear Diner! Their portions are large and their prices are reasonable. If you're going with more than two people plan on a wait no matter when you go. If it's just you or you and one other person you can usually get immediate seating if you're willing to sit at the bar stools. In all the years I've been going to Black Bear Diner's across the state, I have never ever had a problem with their food. If you've never been you need to try them!</review>

<text>Ordered the fried chicken. Had way too breading and was over cooked.

Tasted like it was cooked last week and then put in the deep fryer to reheat.

Not impressed!!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

How can you go wrong for a good, big breakfast from this place.  I will say, add a little more crunch and grease to the shredded breakfast potatoes.  My go to is the country fried steak and eggs.  There is a mondo size but I would die as it is a lot of food.  Love the rye bread, nice and thick.  I'm a fan of the coffee too, nice deep robust flavor.  Comfort food at its best!</Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Tried to order food for like 5 minutes, before they closed because I wanted my food to be hot and fresh when my dad went to pick it up and it was a last-minute order. But the first time I called, it kept ringing for a solid 3 minutes. The second time I called, I head a loud beep that nearly deafened me, and there was no voice on the other line. I tried to say "hello?" several times, but there was definitely no one on the line. The third time I called, they waited until 8 on the dot to pick up the phone (closing time) and said "sorry, we're closed and can't take any orders." So clearly there was someone there to pick up the phone the whole time, they just deliberately chose not to answer until after closing time so that I couldn't order dinner. It was incredibly rude, and if their staff are like that then they don't deserve your money. I would advise getting your dinner elsewhere.<//Text>< date>

Amazing staff and great food. We have been coming to Black Bear for so many years with my Papa who lives at the veterans home. We only get to see him about once a month and the routine is to go tot he Black Bear and then to see a movie! Thank you to all of the amazing staff for always remembering my family's face and especially to everyone for being so nice to my grandpa (he just loves you guys) Get the taco salad or the tri-tip dip...its huge so bring your appetite</text>

Black Bear Diner has been consistently one my favorite breakfast joints. Unfortunately, the service and food were horrible today. We sat at the counter and watched our food sit under the warmer for 15 minutes. A server ate a fry off a plate, and even after our breakfast was served we had to wait for eating utensils. Our food was barely warm and lacked the consistency we’ve experienced in the past.</Text>

Food is really wonderful. Fresh, and abundant. Want to let management know that in this time of a pandemic - staff was observed bussing dirty dishes, then serving customers without washing hands - don't want to name servers - but staff needs better infection control training. (I'm a former food safety inspector, so probably notice more, but customers will be more at ease with better food handling practices).< /review>

This place has a great atmosphere and aesthetic. The interior looks better than the average Black Bear Diner. The service is great, and the food is perfectly fine. However, the location of this restaurant is its biggest downfall. They are positioned right next to an IHOP, which is cheaper and not that much worse in quality. However, I would still recommend it.</Review>

My personal favor is the big foot chicken fried steak, it’s so yummy with country loaded potatoes yum , we definitely recommend this restaurant..</Text>

Crowded, popular and noted that large parties had a very long wait for their orders. Food is good. Reasonably priced.</text>

<Text>We ordered online for curbside pickup.  The restaurant is understaffed and do not answer the phone so no curbside.  Potatoes were undercoked.  The rest of our meal, Bigfoot Chicken Fried Steak, was OK.
Curbside pickup should not be an online option without staffing for it.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Horrible. We arrived at 6:30pm. They said they were closing at 7 and are not seating anyone. It was Halloween and the manager was dressed in a skimpy unprofessional costume. We ordered food to go and asked 4 times for extra gravy and if mashed potatoes come with the open faced turkey. Twice the girl that took our order said it did. When we got home no potatoes or extra gravy. Apparently it's more important for them to leave early then take care of their customers. Won't go back there ever!</review>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>Black Bear is my favorite go to restaurant when we're on a road trip. This location disappointed both of us. We stopped in around 7 PM on a Sunday expecting the usual stellar experience we have always had at other locations. When we walked in there were several employees at the hostess area but we were not acknowledged or greeted by any of them for what seemed like an eternity. We were seated in a booth in a quiet area. Our drink order was not taken by the host who seated us as it usually is at other locations  and it was several minutes before we saw the waitress. She seemed new and quite nervous as we placed our drink order asking us if we wanted water in our iced tea then corrected herself and asked if we wanted lemon in it. Placing our food order was difficult as the first three items we chose were sold out. My GF settled for the third item on the menu that sounded good to her. I had to settle for the third item also. I don't understand a restaurant being out of signature items so early in the evening. The items were Chicken Pot pie, pot roast and onion rings. I could forgive them being out of one item but three in row is three strikes and you're out! The waitress was sweet and apologetic but poorly trained. This was truly a disappointing experience for us.  Not only was the restaurant out of the food we wanted to order but the meal I settled for was not properly prepared and very disappointing flavor wise.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Even though you usually have a short wait for Saturday morning breakfast/brunch it is well worth the wait. I love it when we get Michelle as our waitress. She is always so up beet and kind. The food is always good and plentiful. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want even if it's not on the menu. Their French toast is amazing and they even have French toast made out of their cinnamon rolls if you really want to be sinful.  I have a noise sensitivity and am disabled, so when we go they are always kind enough to try and find us a booth that is in the corner. Enjoy!!😄</text>

My family and I went to Black Bear Diner in Napa for lunch and I ordered the chicken tenders and I liked the ranch and barbecue sauce it was really good I couldn't decide which I liked better so I chose both. The proportion sizes were big for when you're really hungry. The place had great customer service and one of the waiters were really nice and friendly which I like to see in any restaurant and for the food it was fast and it didn't took long to come by. I will come back and order those chicken tenders, once I come and visit Napa again.</Review>

Had the BIG FOOT AND PAN CAKES . The meat got thinner and the breading got thicker . The hash browns were more of a ribbon cut and a little to burnt in some spots . Other spots weren't browned at all . The grill was too hot , and we're cooked too fast . The eggs were perfect and the PAN CAKES were GREAT 👍. Server was polite and fast .  I should have gotten the ribeye dinner it's only 2 bucks more . All in all I left belly bulging feeling nice and fat . Your Friend Johnny<//review>

Sad to say that the food here has really gone downhill over the last year or so. When you spend around $70 for breakfast for 3 people, it should be MUCH better than this! The California omelet should just be a mushroom omelet, really dry with a couple little slivers of brown avocado on top...yuck. Also, paid extra for gravy, didn't receive. We will NOT be coming here again and nor should you!<//Text>

We usually have the vegetarian omelette, and it's always good. We often sub the biscuit for a pancake. Service at this one is always friendly and great, and they always seem to have fresh coffee!</review>

Great way to start the day before tasting endless amounts of wine.  I can promise you will almost never finish your entire plate.  They always make sure to give you plenty of food.  Menu is pretty large.  The pancakes are my favorite thing on the menu.  Good mimosa's too!  See you guys again soon.< /text>< Time>

<date>1621612460133</date><text>I figured they had new staff after 2 years so I thought I'd give this place another shot.

Came in by myself,. And simply only requested a table.  After waiting a half hour the waitress wanted to put me in a booth sitting in a chair in the aisle.

If you're not going to let me eat at the location you right up front so I don't have to sit around and waste my bloody time

I still recommend highly going someplace else.</text><Rate>1<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5</rating><text>Definitely went beyond expectations in terms of food and service. The pancakes are to die for - their recipe is seriously one of, if not, the best I've ever had - so butter and fluffy, yet creamy as well. It is easy to mess up breakfast, but they do it well here and with a smile. Love the theme of the restaurants as well and the fact they support the community and organizations, such as the National Park Service. Very cozy and enjoyable experience.<//text><time>1496630189019</time><Name>Steve P< /Name>< Resp>

I can't tell you how many black bear diner's there are but we all know that there's a lot. I've been to several I never really had any complaints but I must say this one hands down has the best staff I've encountered. Everybody's always super nice and smiling. Really not much more you could ask for< /review>

The service was GREAT (shoutout to Tessa who served us professionally, friendly -just superb- at 11pm!
We got a lot of food for the money we paid so no complains there. However, it was very heavy and the quality could have been a tad better.
I would recommend it if you are on hungry and in need for a good feed!</Text>

Aside from being heavy on salt, this is a great fun place for breakfast any time of day. Decent burgers & salads, too. If you like bears, this is the place to go.<//text>

Clearly, her social skills were on full display to the table behind us however, getting us fed wasn't much of a priority.

The portions are great especially for breakfast. Dining area is clean and  neat, They don't try to vacuum right next to you while you're eating. Staff are always greet you with a smile, on the ball with service. But my issues are small... They should open at 0500 and close at midnight (come on!) and quit changing The side dishes...I mean really who eats that much asparagus or squash, with one piece carrot or broccoli...</review>

Black bear has tumbled in their food quality and service.  I think they sold out cuz it feels like an IHOP now...Victims of there own success I suppose.  I'll hit up some of the smaller mom and pop spots instead for my breakfast needs.</review>

This is such a fun diner. I wish we had some out East. Next time I am in California I will certainly return. Their biscuits are fantastic. Would recommend to anyone.</Text>

I am compelled to write this.  WORST SERVICE EVER!!!

The server was very nice..  But, what's up with the dude who delivers the food?  He should be working at Domino's Pizza..

I ask the guy add some garlic bread to my order as he delivers it..  And, he laughs in my face.. I kid you not.  It was so bad, I confronted him about it.. Then I left, and didn't eat the food..< /review>

<Text>I have been to Black Bear restaurants before. They are basically the same. The food is always good. This particular Black Bear restaurant however, the hostess was terrific.  More than usual and the waiter did an excellent job. They all seem to really want to work.

<text>I wasn't impressed at all! I ordered a medium well classic hamburger with sweet potatoe fries, and I got, a rare hamburger with burnt sweet potatoe fries, fewer than a McDonald small order of fries! It was awful! That was the first and last time I'm going there! I only gave it two stars because at least the order was ready when we picked it up!< /text></record>

<text>Didn't have the Trump tip again.  Until I said this is second time and we were going to leave.  Waiter went and asked them to cut some up for us and they did.   It wasn't exactly as rare as I like and it was chewy.  But, he did try.< /text><Time>1559786732284<//Time><rating>3<//rating>< Name>

I recently went to Black Bear, and never have I gotten worse food poisoning. Got regular pancakes with scrambled eggs and fruit, came home and my gut was growling like a damned grizzly. Only reason I'm giving it two stars is because our service was good. Valentino was very pleasant and didn't just disappear as soon as you sat down.<//review>

<text>I passed a poster for Black Bear, they said they had a new menu.  They do and most of what changed was their prices: no surprise, they went up.  They are still one of the slowest restaurants in Napa, where waitresses walk by and purposefully ignore someone because it is not their station. I am not thinking there is anyone overseeing the place as staff wander around in pairs, talking but no one is attentive to the patrons. It was sad. So if personable service by someone is what you want: go someplace else.  It is still a ton of food for an order.  If you can make the wait.< /text>< date>

Revised! Up  from 3 to 4 stars. We ended up going back for dinner. It was a much better service.
The food is reasonably priced and portions are generous. The service was subpar. Except for my toast, the food was good. My toast was served burnt. The waitress never came back to inquire if food was ok, did not ask when she picked up plates ( and uneaten burnt toast). The gentleman that took our money did not ask if food, service was ok, nor thank us for coming in.< /text>

<review>The server was excellent the open face hot turkey sandwiche was terrible. So salty was the gravey I could feel my arteries harding lol. Sent it back brought me another plate of just turkey ...the turkey was also salty. Gave up at that point. I usually love the food there I eat all the time at the one in Vallejo.  Was not the servers fault she tried so hard to make it right even offering me different items from the menu. I could see both cook looking over at my table so at that point I was uncomfortable. I got a Black Bear Gift card for Christmas think I will use it in Vallejo.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x8085060e6ab52965:0x5c46475997b07c31<//gmapID></record>

I love the portions at black bear, i actually used a to go box and that's rare! The food was really good on my breakfaet visit. This location in napa tends to be packed most of the time. The service at the 'bar' was decent except that i was able to watch my meal sit under the heat lamp for about 5-10 minutes and we got a kick out of the tv screen that showed 0% of orders were going out on time.<//review>

There is delicuous food, and great service from the moment you walk in. Definitely a place to go with family, friends, and on holidays. The wait it worth it indeed. Thanks Black Bear!</Review>< time>

My wife ordered biscuits and gravy. We found numerous strands of long dark brown hair mixed in her biscuits. I had southern scramble with biscuits and gravy. Wife would not eat hers, but mine was good, but too much country potatoes.</Text>

The huevos rancheros was really good. Lots of food. Faith was a great server. Good food, good prices and good service can't ask for more.</Review>

I hadn't been here in years because I didn't really like it but gave it another shot. Unfortunately it was a disappointing meal. The biscuits were big but tasted gross and had a wierd texture. And the hash browns were barely cooked at all. It's a shame though cause the service is always top notch.<//Text>

<text>The food was over cooked and not very good. Fries were almost burnt and chicken strips dry. No dressing on Cole slaw. Fish was tough and no flavor, over cooked.  We were traveling and have come to expect consistency from the Black Bear chain, but we're very disappointed with Napa Black Bear. We will not eat there again.<//text>< Pictures>

Food was served hot and fresh. This Black Bear Diner got off to a rocky start years ago, but has since proved itself to be one of the more popular places in town for locals.< /Review>

<text>BEARS BEETS BATTLESTAR GALLACTICA

Bur seriously... SO MANY F*****G BEARS.

Oh btw, they serve food. And it comes in bear size portions. The surprising thing is that it's actually really good! The vegetables (though hard to find) are fresh and flavorful, the meats are plentiful, the biscuits as large as your fist and the service is exceptional.< /text>< pictures>

Good service, but so-so quality of food. Would avoid the steak if I came back, too fatty and it had more similarities with a pork chop than a good steak.</Text>

<text>Usually my favorite place to eat. However I was very disappointed with the slow service on our last visit.  After our food was brought out our server took what seemed like forever to check up on us.  I ordered the all you can eat fish fry.  By the time she came to check on us our whole table was completely done eating. I wanted a second serving of fish, only to be left waiting longer to finally have the manager come over 5 minutes later to tell me they ran out. Really?  We were seated before 7pm. All I'm saying is that if you can't keep up with the demand for a promotion that you are putting on then end the promotion.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x8085060e6ab52965:0x5c46475997b07c31</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Black Bear Diner is always a hit and always busy whenever we come.  Today was opening day for Little League 2018 -- so why not?  Honestly, we were in Buttercream's parking lot -- which didn't have a stall to park in ..so we ended up here.
Party of 3 -- around 11 in the morning .. about a 20 minute wait she says.  I'm telling you, it was packed!  And it was a Saturday haha.  They didn't take longer than maybe 10 minutes -- super quick for them.  We was hangry too.  So hangry my son didn't order from the kids' menu AND he ate all his food.  That almost never happens.  The man had an omelette and one waffle.  The kid had chocolate chip pancakes (2), 2 over easy eggs and bacon.  I had my usual chicken fried steak and eggs with their hash.  We were very pleased .. with the food and the service.  Will we come back?  Heck yes!!< /text>

This place is terrible, service is too slow, waitress was kind of rude, food was lacking on flavor and poor technique. You can see there are not very capable cooks in  that place. We had to wait a lot for a table and it wasn't worth it at all. Not going back ever. First and last.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>4 of 5 stars to the Black Bear Diner on Soscol Ave in Napa, CA. I've been to several Black Bear Diner's and so my comment will reflect the others also. BBD is a great place for a great big meal! Each has a somewhat unique atmosphere with plenty of black bears about to keep you company. BBD is great for breakfast and I highly recommend "Bruce's Meat Lover Omelet". For dinner I suggest you be very very hungry and go for a "Bob's Big Bear Burger". I do highly recommend Black Bear Diner.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I chose a date it been about 2 years. I’m on oxygen and have other problems and I want to order food delivered in Napa, Ca
only they do not deliver food. I tried Grubhub and Eat.24 and they will not either. There are senior citizens in Napa so you would pick up a lot of business.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><text>Worst experience in my life.  Food was cold , ordered then was told was out of the product i requested then I reorder to be told ten min later they ran out of that too. When i finally reserved my food it was cold i asked for it mid rair . Yet it looked as tasted a if my food was sitting on counter for several hours. Was rubber and rough  Even after i made my complaint to the one in charge all i got was a I'm sorry several times with no resolution.  Bad food,  dirty bathroom no tp. Orders where plated with the wrong idioms and had to be replated all they did was scrape from one plate to the other for my company and I  .  I was completely appoled on how this place was ran.  Pore food and pore management.  Do not go here unless you want to have a bad day.<//text>< pictures>

We arrived her from PUC in Agwin for a late night celebration for my daughter's performance and received lousy service. We had a table of seven and did not receive all our fries. When I questioned it the waiter said they had ran out and turned off the friers.
No discount was given and I paid full price.<//Text>

<UserId.>104116955882054868305</UserId.><Text>(Translated by Google) I have been to that place 2 times and the first time they gave us a table but they took a long time to attend us, in the end we left the place and no one ever came to take the order, the second time it was worse we were just standing at the entrance waiting to be served , they only looked at us but nobody attended us and the place was little crowded 😒 bad experience

He ido 2 veces a ese lugar y la primera vez  nos dieron una mesa pero tardaron muchísimo para atendernos, al final nos fuimos del lugar y nunca nadie llegó a tomar la orden, la segunda vez fue peor solo estuvimos parados en la entrada esperando hacer atendidos, solo nos miraron pero nadie nos atendió y el lugar estaba poco concurrido 😒 mala experiencia<//Text></record></dataset><record>
