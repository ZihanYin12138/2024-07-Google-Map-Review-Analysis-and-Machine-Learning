Ian is a fabulous host.  Terrific hard to find wine, paired impeccable with great food and company<//text>

We had a fantastic time dining at Somm’s Kitchen run by the multitalented Ian. Conceptually the experience is a surprise tasting menu supercharged with trophy wines and liquors. This all takes place at a 12 seat curved bar where you can see Ian assemble each menu item. Ian slow prepares the items in advance using slow cooking, curing, sous vide, etc. and then finishes the dishes in front of you. The food is great but then he uses his sommelier background to pair wines and in our case bourbons with each course. And not just any wines or bourbons, Ian is looking to take the mystique out of the trophy or cult brands (like Bryant Family, Saxum, Sine Qua Non, Stagg) and happily pours these to get diner reactions. The result by the end of the night will leave you in a state of rapture and eager to plan your next visit.<//text>

<Review>We walked out this evening thinking only of coming back.   Ian is providing food and wine a thousand steps above anything you are getting anywhere else. Smoked/dehydrated/rehydrated tomotaes were unlike anything else and delicious.  A steak better than any restaurant or home.  Homemade duck sausage with foie gras.  Risotto/raisin pudding and 16 day reduced oranges.  All of it paired with wine you won't have elsewhere.  A truly singular experience.</Review>< UserId.>

< Review>
We had the best time last with this experience at Somm's Kitchen.  Ian really outdid himself with this one! The 10 courses - including 4 different versions of duck (foie gras, pulled, breast, and sausage), scallops, and lamb - were each expertly tailored to 10 different Absolution Cellars
wines (plus 3 Champagnes).  It is the best on the Central Coast, a must do eexperience!<//Review>

I've been twice with my husband. First for our anniversary and again 6 weeks later to bring family last night. Ian and his staff are absolutely amazing and very welcoming. The food is inventive and delicious, but not stuffy. Ian's explanations of the food and wine are fascinating and down to earth. He is more than happy to try to accommodate allergies and preference (my husband isnt big on seafood). If you like good food and wine then hands down this is an experience that should not be missed whether you're visiting or a local like us. There's  no set menu to allow room for new experiments and to vary based on seasonal ingredients. Be sure to plan ahead as he books up!</text>

We did the chefs table.... Absolutely amazing experience. The man, the myth, the legend! I had heard him throughout the Paso Robles area from other industry and it was truely spectacular experience from the wine to the food to conversation. Blows doors on any other intimate food experience you could have. And BONUS now does liquor pairings with aged whiskey varieties. Blended beautifully with the wine. I am definitely going to come back and bring friends. This dude knows his stuff and humble brag he’s truely one a kind!<//Review>

I’m still on the fence on this one.  On one hand I had a great experience wine tasting.   Food was tasty but left me quite hungry.  Had to go eat a real meal afterwards.

Let me explain.

About a dozen of you sit around a long circular bar type counter.  Owner/chef assembles small dishes that he pairs with wine.   Food is not cooked in front of you and is fairly easy to pull off.  Chef claims to have worked at a Michelin restaurant but these are not fancy dishes.

We had appetizers like sliced meats and cheese.  Also a warm soup.   Then came a chunk of salmon and a bit of steak.   Each dish was quite good but did not quite make a meal.  And I’m a small guy who typically does not eat much.

Each dish, however, was paired with a wine.  Wine education and pairing is the real strength here.    We had two kinds of bubblies, whites and reds.   They all quite good and paired really well.   When your glass was empty he would pour some more.   So that part was quite nice.

The seating is a bit peculiar.  Some people get the good seats and get to see what he is doing and others sit on the sides and don’t get much of his attention.  The people who came the latest (the ones we all had to wait for) got the best seats so not sure how that works.

Part of the way through another group enters and they sit in a back room.   Now they get part of the chef’s attention too.

Overall it was a fun experience. There was plenty of good wine to drink, but don’t expect a filling meal.  Would I go back?   Yah, likely, but I’d eat first.<//Review>

Ian at Somm's Kitchen is a master of wines, wine pairings and presentation. A humble and most generous host, he educates the mind and pampers the palate with his extensive wine knowledge and creative dishes.  If you have not yet had the pleasure of a Somm's Kitchen experience , you are missing out on a memorable evening!<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience! I highly recommend this intimate dinner setting if you love wine and food. Ian provides seating at the bar for 14 so we were lucky someone cancelled and we were able to fill their spots. Otherwise, you must make a reservation in advance.

Ian is very knowledgable and thoughtful about how specific wines can be paired with the food. This was unlike anything we have ever seen before and were so happy to have had the pleasure of meeting Ian and tasting his passion through each food and wine pairing. We loved that it was an educational evening as he spoke about each wine and the process of each dish presented to us.

It is very clear that Ian has the heart, passion, and knowledge for wine as well as food and it was really great to step into his world for the evening. This is a must-do in Paso Robles and we will definitely be back!<//review>< pictures>

<text>Somm's was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. Ian prepared at least 8 courses paired with 12 to 14 wines. Both the food and wine were incredible. It has an intimate atmosphere, and Ian does a great job explaining both the food and wine, without the pretentious feel that can sometimes come with fine dining. We will definitely be going back. You won't find a better food and wine experience for the money. Somm's is a must stop if you're in Paso!<//text><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Ian has created such a comfortable welcoming environment for an interesting, modern culinary experience for the central coast. Surrounded by strangers, some local, some from afar, all sitting, enjoying, and learning together about wine and the food beautifully plated in front of us. A modern atmosphere for dinner can be intimidating; Ian seamlessly provides a humble setting while serving Michelin-star ingredients. This is top notch for California cuisine. It's so wonderful to watch a chef-somm smile all night as he pours wine into glasses, informing and intriguing his guests about what he truly cares about, course after course. Amazing night, meal, and company! Pictured is a beautiful orange cooked for 12 DAYS!!!!<//text>< time>

I was blown away by how much fun this restaurant is. Dining at Somm’s Kitchen is like attending a dinner party where you know next to know one but by the end of it you’re making plans and are the best of friends. From the moment you walk in until you leave you feel like a guest in his home. Ian has perfected hospitality.

And all while being chef, maître d’, and sommelier. I know of no where else you can find an experience like Somm’s Kitchen.</Text>

Go here. Experience this. Seriously. You’ll regret it if you don’t. We started our weekend in Paso here and it was the best food and wine pairing I’ve ever had. Ian hosts a night of amazing food, great conversation, exceptional wine and best of all it was relaxed and non pretentious. Ian is like a unicorn that I can only dream of becoming...he knows good wine and will tell you all about it (already super impressive) and then he comes out of the kitchen with these incredible dishes that take several days to create and you’re just blown away by it all. A chef and a somm? Could you ask for a better experience? Thanks for hosting us Ian, we’ll be back!< /Review>

Somms is a “do not miss” if you’re traveling to Paso! We are never disappointed and always delight in Ian’s personal touches and flare. It’s impossible  to pick a favorite out of the evenings fare.... instead we just pick a date of when we’re coming back.< /Text>

Absolutely amazing. Every course was expertly paired with a wine. nothing but the finest cuisines and wines were served here. It is an absolute foody delight. If you have the chance to stop here you would be doing a disservice if you skipped it. Worth every penny. Check it out you'll thank me later!< /review>

Somm's kitchen. Be ready for a unique experience!  This is not a run of the mill restaurant. It's a "By reservation only" you and the Chef experience. Be prepared for quite a few exceptional small bites paired with wine from all over the world. It's not a meal that will set you back a few pounds, but you will be intrigued by the personal attention and care given to each dish. Reservations could be a month out.</review>

The experience was SO good that, being able to get a seat there the next evening was one of the factors weighing into whether or not I was going to book my hotel for another night. The universe was smiling upon me when they could accommodate me again. Trust me when I say that, this place is an immense bargain at $100 per person.

The evening was like a super fun dinner party, and a sense of community was shared with everyone’s mutual love of great wine and food. I don’t think I could pass through Paso again, without stopping here.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Last night i celebrated my birthday with an outstanding culinary experience in paso robles.  Somm's Kitchen does an 8 course meal with a custom selected wine pairing from the phenomenal Chef Ian.  There was nothing served that was short of spectacular. The seating is 14 people who you get familiar with as the meal is served over a 3 hour period.  Im a full on foodie and i would say this is the best experience I've had.  This rivals or perhaps eclipses anything you'd fine in any major city.  I'd highly recommend you experience this for yourself (don't let the price deter you it's worth that and more truly loook atw hat they charge for similar culinary adventures in San Francisco and Chicago)!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>Fantastic place for wine tasting! I can't say enough good things about Somm's Kitchen. The night my wife and I stopped here we were lucky. The owner was serving for us. I let him choose our tasting and boy was I pleasantly surprised. He asked a little about what we wanted, then took over from there. By the end our "blind" tasting I was in love with Syrah. Before walking into Somm's Kitchen Syrah was one my least favorite varietals. They know what they are doing and how to do it.

Be prepared. There are only a few seats around the bar. I will go here first the next time we visit.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Ian is incredibly knowledgeable on wine and food, but has the ability to cut through the technical terms and give you a fundamental understanding of how to identify the grape and assess them and determine what you like (or don't like)
He calls it BLIC...Balance, Lenght, Intesity, & Complexity...
Not enough space to tell you more but if you are ever in Paso Robles CA you have check him out.</review>

<Text>Very special. As good wine+food pairings as you will find. Many Old World gems, a few local wines in the mix, Ian is the man. We enjoyed the limited seating around the bar setup, but if you want a table go to Bistro Laurent or Artisan or Il Cortile. Everthing was 5* so challenging to pick a standout. The duck breast comes to mind.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I love walking into a new situation and not being exactly sure what I'm about to experience.  I love even more walking out thinking I can't WAIT to tell others that they need to experience this, too!

I think if people consider going to Somm's kitchen buying a ticket to an experience instead of paying a bill for dinner they'll get far more out of the ride.

On March 9, my husband and I were visiting Somm's kitchen from Austin, Texas.  We had been in Paso for the first time last year before this restaurant opened, so we were excited to try something new on the square.  We made a reservation about a month before.  When we walked in, Ian told us our spot was at the end of his semi circular bar which had enough room for about 14 people.

Ian greeted us and asked, "Are you hungry?"  We stated we were, and he handed us a glass of a most interesting Austrian sparkling wine.  We had no menu in front of us, wine or otherwise.  There was nothing to suggest what we might be eating, what we might be drinking, how many courses there may be, or even how much things might cost.

I'm sure we could have asked Ian, but we decided we were in for the ride!  For the next two hours we were in his hands as he had us try a local cheese, a foie gras that rivaled that of Michelin starred restaurants, a prime filet, lamb, and on and on...

It seemed some people came and went and didn't stay for the whole ride.  I'm not sure if all the kinks are ironed out there, but it didn't hinder our experience at all.

Each course was served with about a half of a glass of wine...unless of course you drank your wine, then more showed up.  None of the wines were particularly expensive, but all were particularly wonderful and the best paired I've ever had with any food ANYWHERE (and not to get all foodie/wine snobby... but we've been to Picasso, Cyrus, Robuchon... the pairing at Somm's Kitchen was simply AMAZING!)

The whole time we felt as though we were Ian's guests.  He chatted to us about the wines and the food and how he had prepared each thing.  At one point, he stopped and gave us a lesson in wine tasting.  It was taught in such a way that novice and experienced wine aficionados a like could enjoy. Ian is an experienced sommelier who teachers wine classes internationally, so getting a chance to experience this was quite a thrill!

In the French style, Ian prepared a salad between the final course and the desserts.  The salad was so creative.  He peeled the quail eggs and prepared it in front of us.  He carefully cut and placed herbs from right to left and as you ate, the herbs and the flavors increased in intensity with each bite.

We finished with desserts and feeling like we had made friends with our fellow diners and our host.

Our final bill was $250 for the two of us.  Both my husband and I felt this was truly a bargain.  We have paid more for less in the past.

Now, for the "to be completely honest" parts.  I would have liked a menu at least when we left if not to follow at the time.  Ian did say that I could email him and he would send a menu with all the information.  I intend to do that, but it would have been nice to look over it that evening, or even as I was writing this review.

Also, I'm not sure exactly how he decided who got what food.  There was a woman sitting next to me who I ran into twice again in the week while we were there.  Each time I saw her someplace else, she was telling other people that she was upset that she asked for potatoes and didn't get them even though some people did.  She did not like her experience at all and thought Ian was rude.  I thought he was funny and dry.  I liked his sense of humor, but I could see where others might find him off putting.  He's a New Yorker, not a Californian... and he still has some of the edge.

I also heard some complain about the price.   I think ANYWHERE you go 11 courses and 11 half glasses of wine for $125 a person is an amazing bargain... but I understand if you're thinking your'e only going to spend $50 on dinner.. this would be a little rough.<//Text></record>

The owner is super nice and friendly, one time he saw me struggling to find certain flavours then he immediately restocked the entire shelf without hesitation or me even asking. The people at the register are nice and greet me personally every time I’m there. There’s also a super good taco truck that takes card in the parking lot so it’s a perfect place to stop for tacos and beer</review>

Good selection of beverages, but they are kind of pricey. Well lit store and parking area. Catering truck is on location. Treat yourself to tasty tacos and a ice cold beer. Open til two a.m.<//review>

<review>It's pretty cool that when i go there, they have worship music going on.. The workers there are real friendly, that's why i choose to go there all the time, and get my quick picks bcuz if I win o want them to get broke off with some of my winnings. BUT 1 THING I HATE ABOUT IT, IS EVERYTIME I GO SOMEONE IS ALWAYS ASKING ME FOR MONEY. YES, JESUS SAID TO GIVE. BUT WHEN U SEE THESE PEOPLE DOING IT ALL THE TIME AND HAVE NO RESPECT, THAT AIN'T COOL! GO GET A JOB LIKE I DID!< /review>< Pics>

This pet store offers low-cost, high-quality products. I had to go to this store yesterday to get some supplies for my puppies. I appreciated their workers treating me with respect. This store, in my opinion, is one of the best in my neighborhood. You should go there if you're looking for a reliable store. It's a definite must-try!<//Review>

<Review>I've come to this pet center for help because my dog has been misbehaving. They helped me understand what I was trying to do as well as what I needed to do to prevent this from happening again. I owe them a debt of gratitude for that.< /Review>< Pics>

MY PET MARKET Tags is the only company that I know of that still produces deeply engraved stainless steel tags. (Many companies used to produce similar quality tags; you could even order them off the box of Milkbone biscuits, but that was then and this is now, and most have cheaped out or gone out of business.) I like the many different sizes and shapes available from Boomerang (a large size for my collies and shelties, and a very tiny size for my chihuahua, with hearts for the girls and rounds for the boys). I like the hanging tags because they are easily noticeable, and I had a couple escape artists in the past who were returned to me a few times thanks to their "jewelry" from MY PET MARKET< /Text>

I don't know how I discovered Boomerang Tags, but I have been ordering from them for about 10 years for at least 4 different dogs. Their tags are great! I will always order from them! Their quality and service is EXCELLENT!!!</Review>

I apologize that we did not get an opportunity to offer you a price match on anything that is found cheaper at a Petsmart or Petco. We try to be as competitive as possible with other brick and mortar pet retailers in the area. We do only order all of our products, especially parishables in small weekly batches to ensure the freshest stock. Big box stores typically order in bulk/truck load and then warehouse for periods of time - Bulk cost discounts are given with those orders.\nWe love doing anything special for our community and price matching and maintaining those prices in customer memberships is something that we are more than happy to do. We hope you that will visit us again!'}</Resp>

Went in to browse and noticed everything is really expensive. I'd consider it more of a pet convenience store than a full fledged pet store. Same items at pet smart or petco for 20% less. If you live across the street and don't mind paying more then it seems like it might suit you just fine.<//Review>

I don't typically write reviews, but feel like I should let people know this store is just pricey beyond reason. I bought a Nature's Miracle corner litter box today. At the time I was so in a hurry that I didn't even notice they charged me $63.99 for this litter box that should not have been more than $30 (looks like you can get it around $18 to $25 online). I was prepared for this store to be more expensive and I was okay with that because it's convenient. But $63 for a plastic regular litter box just feels like a rip off. I already used the litter box so there's no point in returning it and shame on me for not noticing the price tag when I was paying. 1 star for friendly staff, but other than that, stay away.< /Text>

<Review>This is a recently opened pet food store in the beautiful new Los Olivos shopping center. The staff are incredible, they have knowledge about their products and the companies who make them. Their store is immaculately kept and incredibly easy to navigate. If you have been driving to some of the other far off destinations you will not have to do that anymore as they also offer price matching. They run many other specials such as pictures of your pets with Santa during Christmas. Next time you need pet food or supplies in Irvine stop in and check out Pet Market you will not be disappointed with their incredible service and quality products.
Thing to note:
This is right beside Whole Foods and shares a parking lot so times that Whole Foods is busy (lunch/after work) parking can be harder to come by.<//Review>< pics>

This place is absolutely insane.  We went there today and were looking around at some of the treats for our dogs.  A bag of Blue Buffalo treats that everywhere else are under $10 were $18.99.  Another bag of treats that are normally about $6 were $14.99.  RIDICULOUS!< /Text>

Great place for kids to have fun. But loud music and lack of sits for adults is not a pleasure. Must of the tables were reserved for birthdays party.</Text>

<text>It was our first time today. My child was playing on a big kids section, if it wasnt for me taking care of my child. He slipped and fell on a crack I told the employee to get him bc I cant be on the obstacle course place. The guy looked at me while my kid almost suffocated on a crack of a jumper. I had to yell at the worker 2 times to get my child and he just looked at me. They need training, since they dont let parents on top of the jumpers to save their own children. Other than that it's a fun place.< /text>< Pictures>

I had a really fun time but a mean guy with long curly black hair was really rude and this was the ninja factory in San Diego Eastlake and my freind told him he had asthma that’s why he had his mask off for a few seconds but then the employee said bro mask up and then he said he has asthma which he did and the employee that I’m talking about said everyone has asthma.so I had a fun time but that rude employee made it a little bit of my experience there not fun<//Review>

We love this place. Both of our sons enjoy going here (ages 3 and 6). It is a great place for them to get energy out and have a safe and fun time. We take advantage of the monthly membership and encourage others to try it out.< /review>

We went in with my three year old and stayed a little longer than half an hour before he started crying because he couldn't do many of the activities there. I called to ask if we could get some type of refund, even partial would have been acceptable. They said that it was against company policy. Later that day, I went in person and received store credit so we are much happier with the final outcome.< /review>

There are a few staff who are very polite and helpful but management generally has a really poor attitude.  We booked our daughter's birthday party there (late July, you either risk a super hot day outside at a park, or put down some $$ and know you'll have a cool place with A/C to let kids run around.  The A/C was out that entire day.  We brought fans from home to try to cool down our area but everyone was completely uncomfortable.  When we first asked, they told us it was on.  Someone else asked later (because if it was on, it needed to be set a lot cooler), and they told us it was broken and someone would be in to fix it the next day.... Things happen but no heads up, no apology, no sense of urgency or "hey, let me get some fans in here", no offer of a discount or some free passes for the kiddos, etc... and the parties aren't cheap! They did NOTHING to try to help or make up for the fact that the entire place was hotter than hell.  Thankfully the kids had fun but we'll stick to Play City from here on out.<//Text>< pictures>

We just had my son’s party there. Kids ranging in age from 16-7 and 2 little (under 2 years) brothers. Everyone had a blast!

It allows little kids to explore and be brave in an area where they are protected, and big kids can try new things.

There was even an area to do piñatas, which most party places don’t allow.  All the kids had fun.

You bring your own food and for our party we did lots of veggies and fruit and hot dogs.

If I had to give any negatives I would recommend that they an extra fridge to store the cakes/ ice cream for parties.< /Review>

Exciting place for kids who like obstacles. A little crowded when we went on a weekend, and a few teens were being pushy. Nice perk is that you can leave for lunch (like Lolita's taco shop next door!) and come back. Or you can bring food and eat there at tables inside.<//Review>

< Review>
My son loves this place. He has so much fun when we go. We've gone for birthdays and just for fun. My only complaint are the staff on the floor monitoring the obstacles. They seriously need some training on how to speak and treat kids. They can be rude and have a mean & condescending tone. One had the nerve to tell my son "who said you can go" when all he could have said was "its not your turn yet or wait" but he yelled at him and I was standing right there. I even commented and told him that he hadnt said it to the other kids and he got defensive and tried to say that he had already "established" the rules and they had to wait until the kids had jumped off which I understand but it doesnt mean you had to say it so rudely especially to kids who are just trying to have fun. I understand its not easy working in a place where kids are running freely but if you do not have the patience to work in a place that is catered to kids then find another job or please train your staff to be more patient and not so rude to the kids. Overall, the place is great. Its clean, well maintained, and the price is great for all day play.<//Review>

On the positive side, this is an outstanding play area for kids 5 and up, challenging them physically in ways that are so much fun the kids keep going for hours.
...or at least that was our experience on a couple of days in the middle of the week. A follow up visit on a Saturday afternoon was a lot less fun.
With a couple of big birthday parties underway, there was little space left for walk-in visitors, but management just kept selling more admissions. There were long lines for activities. No seating for parents. Overwhelmed staff not available to keep bigger kids from shoving little ones aside.  As we complained about this, they were still letting in more unsuspecting families.
We’ll keep visiting on weekdays, when things are better controlled and less crowded. It’s disappointing that management is so unaware that they’re sort of ruining what should be a very positive experience.<//text>

The kids liked it a lot but it is not so clean. Also fairly expensive for what it is.< /Text>

My husband and I have used HR & Block for several years now and we are always satisfied. We have worked with several different tax preparers at the Woodland location and have always enjoyed our experience. They have all been fast and efficient. It is well worth the cost and we would recommend this location to everyone we know!< /text>

H&R Block in Woodland makes doing your taxes so easy! The staff is amazing, the environment is welcoming, and they are very knowledgeable. I have been using them for many years. Don’t file taxes on your own, use H&R Block. You won’t regret it.< /Text>

<review>I’ve been coming to this H&R Block for about 20 years for two reasons: fast and friendly service and I get to see my favorite tax preparer Sherry.
Just completed my 2020 taxes, and as usually it was quick and painless.
See you next year Sherry :)< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>My husband and I have been going to Emma Rivera at H&R Block for years now and we have always felt that she does an exceptional job every year. She keeps us well informed every time we see her and she gives us all the information we need to complete our taxes for the following year. Emma is very personable and kind and extremely knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to my friends and family.</Review><Name>Jennie de Leon</Name><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

<Review>I had a very pleasant experience with H&R Block. My tax professional was knowledgeable, efficient, friendly, and willing to explain details. My only two reservations are the instructions for necessary documents was minimal and the fee for filing was a little high for me. Otherwise, extremely helpful and I will most likely return next year. Thank you!</Review><username>Hannah Koeppl< /username>< resp>

Love this place! Went the first time while visiting last year & came back again once I moved to LA. The food & service was great each time - love the happy hour deals & outdoor seating options. I plan to come back every time I'm around the Venice Beach area!</review>

We were here on a bright day with some cool breeze. Seated outside was just perfect for me.

G who helped us had so much energy, which made a lot of difference.

All the items we had were great

Now sometimes I think about it in the middle of my week like a beautiful humble woman I met out day drinking.  (I hope I see her soon) This place has the best most hospitable local friendly staff from the hostess and door guy miguel (who is very knowledgeable about the local happenings) to the "Mr I can get you anything you want to make you feel welcome guy" I think his name was Will. Very good experience. Can't wait to go back.  Best local place around with excellent food.<//review>< Pictures>

Such a gem! Went to Mercedes for the first time last night and it was an overall amazing experience. From the food we ordered (Mojo Chicken, Chimichurri Shrimp, Chicken Enchiladas, and Citrus Salmon- ALL AMAZING) to the service which made you feel like you’re at dinner at a friend’s or family’s house, it’s a place you’ll definitely return to.

Thanks to everyone that made us feel so special and hats off to the chef. See you again soon!</text>

<text>Fantastic brunch spot. We went there in January on a break from the NAMM Convention. After walking from the hotel we stumbled upon this place and right from the get go it looks like a perfect place of something vibrant yet something cool and calm. And it was just that. Staff were excellent informative cool and casual. The cuisine was modern American Latino and other infusions of West Coast flair and food. I would not hesitate to go back there. In fact I will be going back there it’s just a matter of when this damn pandemic lets us back into this amazing part of America and this amazing part of LA area.
I had the eggs Benny. And it was perfect.<//text>< user_name>

Neat place to catch a beer and view. Food has to be ordered with a drink. We had the Spinach and Artichoke dip and it was pretty good. Great service and shaded outdoor seating available.</text>

<Review>A very nice menu at a great location almost right on the beach!

The staff was friendly and the restaurant was nice. A little squishy with the seating but not too bad.

The food me and my partner ordered was vegetarian that we’ve never had the option to try before. Plant based chorizo and a unnpesto feta plant based burger. Very good!!
The plantain was a great touch, it was blackened nicely and carried a big flavour.

I would recommended this place for a nicer meal in the area!</Review>< Name>

<Name>andrew saetern<//Name><Review>A buddy of mine was visiting from Idaho and I took him out to Venice for dinner. Mercede's Grille seemed like a good option so we walked in for a late dinner. It was a slow Wednesday night, but it looked like they had their fair share of regulars. They were very friendly with the bartender. We sat at the bar. I had the Fish & Chips with an iced tea. It was delicious Fish & Chips, but super heavy for this time of day. The fries were fresh and crispy too.

Service was fast, as it was a slow night. Parking was easy at this time of the night. A bit pricy, but understandable since it's located along the beach. Worth giving a try if you're in the area. Your meal can be followed by a walk along the beach, day or night.</Review></record>

Food was nice. Cocktails so so, Moscow Mule was far from what you get in the bars. Waitress was very nice and helpful! I would rate it 4 stars but... I left restaurant for the beach and came one hour later because I needed restroom and security guy didn’t let me in(( He said if they let everyone in, there would be thousands of people in the restroom, but come on, I was your client one hour ago (I told them) , not yesterday, I spend 100$ on cocktails in your restaurant, and you know what? Now I need a restroom! They didn’t let me in and it caused so much inconvenience for me(<//review>

My experience:

Me and my husband popped in for lunch at Mercede's. We were greeted by friendly staff and seated in the wonderful outdoor seating right away! Service was quick and prompt. Our server made sure we were comfortable.
Food ordered:
Truffle fries - 5/5 ..extra points to the habanero aioli👍
Hibiscus tacos - 5/5 😃It is a must try👍
Overall, the experience was amazing.

<GmapID>0x80c2baa3011cec7d:0xb457ce6d59b37180<//GmapID><Text>Me and my parents stopped into this place last Sunday and it was by far the best food we had in LA all weekend - so flavorful and delicious. Half the menu was authentic (as far as I can tell) Cuban food and half was slightly more expensive fresh seafood/seafood hybrid items, it seemed like there was something for everyone. Me and my parents all asked the (very nice) waitress for recommendations on her favorite cuban dishes and all three were amazing and so different. We left so full and so happy, and proceeded to talk about the food all weekend. Definitely go if you get the chance - the ambiance is quite nice as well, although people were a little more drunk than I expected in a place as well decorated as it was.<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

Great place to go to and meet interesting characters!! It feels like one big happy family. Everybody talks to everybody. This is one of the many advantages of being in a beach town.<//Review>

<Review>Food is always great, seems like it's always full of off-duty, retired, or just plain-clothed cops talking about past narcotics cases.  Kind of weird but this cash only restaurant is still one of my favorite places to get food in the city.  I always have leftovers and I always leave full.  Comfort foods, no preservatives and nothing too fancy.< /Review>< Pictures>

Found this restaurant randomly while visiting Venice Beach and was completely wowed. Every dish was delicious, flavorful and authentic.

From Cuban coffee, breakfast muffins to the entrees our party of four ordered, there were raves all around. Great service, ambiance, I would highly recommend.< /review>

<text>Great brunch! Made reservations since we were a large group, but certainly not necessary. Great brunch menu and the service was fairly quick and the food and drinks were great. Parking on a Saturday morning is tough, but the location is perfect for strolling along the beach after a yummy meal.< /text>< pics>

Came here off of a recommendation and was happy I did, the food was amazing and the staff very friendly.

I recommend any of the dishes with pork as well as the hibiscus tacos, that's mainly because that's what I tried but everything looked really good! Plantains were amazing.

Great food, great staff, Great Job!!!<//text>

Great spot!! We were able to sit down with our dog on the patio right when we got there in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. The server was super nice and accommodating. Our food and requests almost came out too fast, which is unheard of for me. The food was super tasty. I got the Mexican blackened fish tacos and my boyfriend got the pulled pork enchiladas and we shared some sweet potato fries. Everything was superb! Will definitely come back!</text>

I love this place So many memories here. Mercede and her family are truly great people. Always been treated like family. Will the bartender is great And the food is PHENOMENAL!!! Anything with the slow roasted pork is highly, highly recommended for breakfast, lunch and especially dinner. Also those sweet plantains can turn a banana hater into an addict instantly😩
Lots of love here, in the food, the atmosphere and especially the service🤗.</Text>

Oh how I love this amazing balance of cultural beauty. From the people to the amazing Amanda this place is one heaven on earth. Steps away from the sunset, eat and then go watch it. Or watch it then come eat.. The order doesn't matter as long as you eat at Mercedes. Hands down, best kept secret in town.<//Text>

Good tasting food in a reasonable price range featuring a cool, rustic aesthetic. Their "Citrus Salmon", running for a cool $20, (and apparently a top 10 dish in US or something) didn't exactly blow me away, but it was good. Would come back again :)</Text>

I was so looking forward to authentic Cuban food but that sure wasn’t it . The breakfast was smothered with some greasy cheddar cheese that was so thick I had to peel it off in order to eat it. The rice was dry and the beans did not have a Cuban flavor more a Mexican flavor.  The sour cream had some weird consistency like it was curdled.  I would’ve told them what I thought but they never even checked to see how I was doing. Total disappointment!< /Review>< Name>

Our waitress had an attitude, her nose was up in the air, and didn't carefully listen to what we ordered. Consequently, when the food came, they had to take it back to the kitchen. Someone drove up in a car with her puppy that she started petting and playing with out in the street. She then returned and handled people's food without washing her hands. Once again she returned outside to play with the puppy. She then shocked us by having it follow her into the restaurant at 11 pm with many people drinking on a Saturday night.

Good breakfast spot; we had a couple of omelettes and coffee during a 1/2 price omelette special and the prices were great at that point! It wasn't busy early in the morning on a weekday. Service was good too.</text>

The Breakfast is Absolutely Amazing! I ate here twice this week. I ordered a mimosa and the Politically Correct Omelet drizzled with cuban sauce, but I did substitute the goat cheese with cheddar cheese. I've also shared the fresh mango and also the blueberry pancakes with my husband.</review>

Sunset at Mercede's.just amazing.
We had a couple of Mojitos and tried the Spinach&Artichoke Dip and the Picadillo Bartolitto.small portions but just enough.
Tasty and not expensive.
Cocktails were pretty strong(thank God)...:-)< /review>

The food is actually quite good but the management can't make up their minds what they want to be: there's club music, sports bar tvs on the walls but restaurant seating...<//text>

The service was great but the guy at the door insisted we sat at a table we did not like because of sun issues so the waitress was,kind enough to take over and give us a good table...She was very nice, we almost walked out if it wasn't for her...Glad we stayed2</review>

(Translated by Google) The location is beautiful but the food and drinks were really not tasty.
The sangria was sour and sour and the snacks were actually not to eat.
There was a menu on the table that was back a month ago, so other dishes and different prices, so we paid far too much afterwards.

(Original)
De locatie is schitterend maar het eten en drinken was echt niet lekker.
De sangria was wrang en zurig en de snacks waren eigenlijk niet te eten.
Er stond een menukaart op de tafel die van een maand terug was, dus andere gerechten en andere prijzen, achteraf hebben we dus veel te veel betaald.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Located very close to the pier.
A place that invites you to enter, with a small letter but well prepared and presented the dishes.
Good attention.

I went here because I saw a commercial about a new iPhone for signing up. I left ATT after many years. The staff here are fantastic! They went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied. They were friendly, patient and professional. I highly recommend this store, they do care about the customer.< /review>

Angie was more than helpful taking care of ALL of my problems and was able to provide me with the solutions I was looking for. Angie also didn’t make me feel as if I was being rushed and made sure to explain everything so I would be able to understand what’s going on with my bill. By far my best experience within a Sprint store< /review>

Ana was so helpful, she made recommendations as to what cases to buy instead of pushing them in me like other places. She also gave me a little discount on my case which made me really happy. I've never been to a sprint store where the employees were so kind and helpful. I love this Location. Definitely recommend this Sprint!</review>< pics>

So we have gone to so many sprint stores in the 5 years we have been a sprint customer and I can honestly say this has been the best store we have gone to. The customer service here is amazing, the store was super clean and the best part there was no wait! Ana and Marlon help us on a Saturday when they were almost going to close and yet they spent their time with us explaining every detail and answering all of our questions! I am definitely referring all my friends and family to go to this location! Thank you Ana and Marlon for restoring our faith in Sprint!</text>

Came here the other day to look at phones. Store was packed but I finally managed to buy my new i phone 6s! One thing I can say though, is don't try to push accessories on me like it's a big deal... I can buy my own TYVM!!< /Text>

<Text>I was with metro pcs and I didn't like my plan, so I heard about the new specials in sprint and I went to check it out. The people who helped me were really nice (Diana & Ana) they were patient with me due that my experience with iPhone is new. They helped me pick up my phone, change lines, and add my new iCloud account they were both wonderful and their manager Jose was great! I will come here for any question I have and I highly recommend others to come<//Text>< Pictures>

The store is fine until The gatekeepers show up and mess up everything, and try intimidating the customers to leave , they seriously need to be put in check or gotten rid of for the safety of Hemet. I'll be watching for the first lawsuits against them closely.< /text>

I gotta give a big thank you to my boy Sam. No matter what he will take care of you. He's truly a good person, so come on by and get your snack on or whatever it maybe.

<Text>Wow....found this little gem of a Coffee House by accident. I ordered a grilled chicken flat bread, a latte with Oat Milk, and a brownie.  They have spectacular goodies...mostly gorgeous cupcakes. Friendly service with a smile.

One out of three drinks we got today were correct. One drink was the mistake of somebody else’s order so we got it for free The third drink was incorrect because they decided that they did not want to put in the effort to take the order correctly and relied on their own memory to tell somebody else what the order was and did not live up to that. The drink of course was incorrect too sweet and “I just wanted my coffee to taste like coffee” was the quote after my wife was pouring an espresso pod of espresso into the already made coffee to balance out. Not great service at this location.< /review>

< Review>
I am very impressed by this place, I recently ordered from here using postmates and they really knocked it out of the park. Presentation, taste, the size of their menu, everything was really good and super affordable. They have won me over as a regular customer, and I highly recommend checking them out if you haven't. Photos are a 32oz(!) iced caramel machiatto, cookies & cream ghiacitto, a red velvet cupcake and a double chocolate cupcake.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I am just so in love with this place to be honest, I really just loved the coffee I had, which was a cinnamon roll and coconut coffee, and I am so sad that I won't be able to have another coffee before I leave to go back home.
As for the cupcakes!! Let me just say there were so many different beautiful cupcakes to choose from with amazing and unique flavors.  I ended up getting honey lavender, pineapple passion, strawberry cheesecake (my favorite) and snowball. All the cupcakes were moist and super flavorful, I loved the strawberry cheesecake so much I actually might make it back today before they close so I can have one more before I go home tomorrow morning.
I definitely suggest making it here for either the coffee or the cupcakes because neither will disappoint you.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The baked goods aren't so great and the coffee isn't for people that like coffee. It's more for the Starbucks crowd. You'd be better off driving the extra ten minutes to a place like Augie's or Lift if you're craving a real coffee. No offense to the staff or anything, just the baked goods are too sweet for my taste and most of the pastries are no longer crisp by mid/end of day. If you're into that Starbucks type of sweet or flavored coffee, give it a shot, but make sure you have a sweet tooth.<//Review>

The cupcakes in the Google Pictures look better than when you come in. For a $4.00+ cupcake I was expecting better but it’s just a regular one well decorated. The only thing that tasted like it should was the Ferrero Rocher decor on top. The staff was very nice and the only reason for the 3 stars. Everything that I saw on the pictures that I wanted looked unappetizing and unappealing. I ended up going to the nearest gas station to get a better bear claw for $1.89. My review was for the cupcakes and staff I didn’t taste their coffee but if that is how the cupcakes looked and tasted I don’t even want to try the coffee. I rather go to Jitters 2 minutes away from my house than drive to be disappointed.< /Review>

< review>
I wanted to order mini cupcakes and I was told the baker could not make them because he was making “other things” I could order the big cupcakes that are like 6$ each! I would understand if this was short notice but this was a little over a 24hour notice, I can’t afford 12 big cupcakes , my daughter loves this place and I’m pretty disappointed, because this is an option on the app.</review>

<time>1577117704198< /time><text>OMG OMG OMG where do I start!!! We had 3 cupcakes from here, s'mores, white chocolate raspberry I believe and the strawberry cheesecake one! My son also got a red velvet loaf and he said it was okay and WOW I got a rice crispy too and it was soooooo yummy!!! The prices were normal, 3.75 per cupcake and 1.90 for the rice crispy but it's a nice size 🤤 and loaf was I I believe like 2.75 or 2.90! So over all the prices aren't bad, desserts were amazing oh and the girl helping us was so friendly and when we told her it was our first time here she threw out some suggestions on which were their popular flavors and her personal favorites!! All I can say is that we had an excellent experience and cant wait to be back in the area once again to try some more flavors since they had sooooo many!!< /text><UserId.>100512007163051050649< /UserId.><gmapID>0x80dcaf56fe6584e9:0x95734f5e1a5af0e0< /gmapID><username>Jessica Rolon</username></record></dataset><record>

Great customer service. Cupcakes taste fresh much better than Casey's Cupcakes. Casey's Cupcakes are just looks not quality. Here at the Cupcake & Espresso bar they are moist and have a good presentation. You get a feeling of tranquility. I liked the Blackberry/Jasmine tea. My 14 year old son liked the Lemonade Smoothie and Rockey Road cupcake.<//text>

Typical coffee joint with the typical coffee variations in a typical strip mall setting, BUT, with an extensive dessert menu. Unfortunately, my chocolate and cream cheese muffin was very dry. Coffee good, muffin bad. Good spot if you're in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit. Unsure if this is a chain, or mom and pop.</text>

<review>I always have a cheerful experience at the Cupcake and Espresso bar. The Day Street location is super sleek. The bathroom is well kept, the tables clean, and for the location it's got a great amount of space. The high ceilings are nice, but there is a slightly small noise generation due to the setup. The staff are fantastic; if you're a regular it becomes familial in nature. Of course the drinks and sandwiches are what ya come for, but with everything else it's just amazing. Also, a rewards system. Ten purchases gets you a free item!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dcaf56fe6584e9:0x95734f5e1a5af0e0< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is a awesome little cupcake shop. They have REALLY good coffee, cold or hot, and super tasty teas. Their prices are pretty decent and pastries fresh. They have numerous cupcake types and usually a special promo cupcake. Love this place.</review>

I love this place! Friendly staff, locally owned, great coffees and treats, even sandwiches. I hesitate to rate it so high only because I’m selfish and don’t want everyone to know about it so that I can’t find a seat. 😁 A great place to study or meet a friend.< /Text>

This is the go to place to study in moreno valley. There are not many coffee shops in moval. This is the first one!! Normally, small business coffee shops are in redlands and Riverside. The coffee here is quality 9/10. The shots of espresso are 60 cents each (cheaper than starbucks)!! The chairs are comfortable. The lighting is great. It is a little chilly, so bring a jacket. The cupcakes are quality and the snawhiches are tastey.< /Text>

<username>Jason Moreno<//username><Time>1618878854414</Time><Rate>4</Rate><review>Buffalo Wild Wings is always a solid choice.

We stopped in to get some wings, beer, and watch the Oakland A's crush the Detroit Tigers.

They were working with an understandable limited menu.  Didn't matter because then stuff that wasn't being served wasn't on our radar.

We ordered small fries, small onion rings, 20 traditional wings and we both had a few big IPAs.
We went with 3 flavors, Asian Zing, Spicy Garlic, and traditional Hot.

Everything was cooked well and served hot and fresh.  The three sauces were very tasty and the wings came with celery, carrots, and both blues cheese and ranch dressing on the side.

It also looked as if there were limited taps but seemed as if they still had a good variety available.

Our server was the bartender and he was great!  Very attentive and brought our food quickly and had fresh beers every time we got low.

The only drawback is that they don't offer the trivia boxes because of COVID.  It's somewhat understandable but a year into it now, we should be able to get the boxes with a quick wipe of sanitizer from the server.  It wouldn't take very long to do for each box and sure wouldn't add anything to the bottom line as I'm sure they have some kind of sanitizer on hand already.

Again, this is a great spot and I do encourage you to go.  There weren't many people when I was there and I'm sure not only could the restaurant use your business but so could the servers and bartenders.

Go... Enjoy... and tip well...

If you like my reviews, hit the "Thumbs Up"!!

<Text>Quick take out and yummy wings. We did the Thursday special which is buy ten get ten or buy six get six. I did Thai and Jalapeño. I preferred the Thai whereas my dad preferred the Jalapeño. I personally found neither super spicy and will go higher up on the spice chain next time.

Not five because here previous times before COVID and had meh service and the meal I got I had to return as it was not great.</Text>< Pics>

Today I called in at 8:10.... they said they closed at 8pm this night. What restaurant closes their kitchen earlier and earlier every passing night when you supposedly close at 10pm.
Or even in the mornings, they don’t even have all of the items on the menu. Horrible.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1613372314195, 'text': "Hey Jackie.

<rate>1< /rate><text>Ordered online and did the 15 boneless and 15 traditional. Only the boneless was marked with sauce on the side.  When we got home and opened our order it was wrong, both boneless and traditional wings came with sauce on the side.  The online ordering is glitchy because we chose 2 sauces for each set of wings and the order only took one sauce per set of wings.  I called in because I was so excited for my wings and ended up with disappointment. I spoke with the manager and asked to have my traditional wings remade or refunded and said I would bring back the wrong order and prove that the order that was input was not the order they fulfilled. Manager said there was nothing they could do. Really? I paid almost $50 with everything it I ordered.
This is how you treat customers, especially during these difficult times? I was willing to drive back with the wrong order to get my corrected order. It is not like I was trying to keep the screwed up order and try to get a free set of wings.  Do not give this Buffalo Wild Wings you're time or money.<//text>< Pics>

Not bad fare, relatively tasty food, very attractive plating. Service is great. Food prices could be a little bit cheaper though. After all, the majority of their profit should be from their alcoholic drink sales.</Text>

Exactly what you would expect, with no disappointments. Friendly well trained staff. Somewhat convenient location. A block from the 101, in a well lit, heavily trafficked shopping center. Busy enough to be fun but not so much as to be inconvenient.</Review>

<Review>First time eating here, service was okay. We arrived about 430pm, not too busy, by the time we left about 545pm it was pretty busy.We ordered the traditional and boneless combo with boneless Caribbean jerk and traditional wings in Thai curry. It took about 30 mins to get the order on the table and when it finally came it was mediocre. There was a very small amount of coleslaw and fries. It's obvious this combo is made for one person, my husband and I decided to share it. It was $18.99, which in my opinion is a little steep for the amount of food that was on the plate but there is essentially enough food in this combo for one person to enjoy. Price point is still high if that's the case. The Caribbean jerk flavor was not as good. It had this distinct, hard to explain taste to it, perhaps it was one of the spices used? Thai curry is pretty spicy but has a really good flavor that I continued to crave after we left. That's the only reason I gave this 3 stars, not  sure if this is enough to bring us back here.<//Review>< pictures>

Interesting place. We arrived and the guy at the door said "Oh, I don't know if we have any tables available"... we look inside, and half the restaurant is empty. We look confused. He says he'll go try and find one. He finds one! We are seated. We get our menus. The alcohol menu (beer, wine and cocktails) do not have ANY prices on them, just calories. Again, we are confused. We ask our waiter why there are no prices on the drink menu, he goes and checks. Comes back, says he can go and find out the prices of whatever drinks we want. Well, where I come from, that is the point of a menu, to provide information and prices about what is on offer. We decide not to drink. Water is easier. We order wings... they are amazing. But I think we will go somewhere else next time.< /Text>

<Review>Quality has gone down since it opened. We usually come or order out once a week. It was great for a while but in recent months service and quality of food have declined. If you order in they can never seem to get the order right, to the point that I just accepted what ever comes out of the kitchen so that we don’t have to have another “this is the wrong order” conversation with our server. If you order for pick up your either going to get wings with no sauce/seasoning or they’re going to tell you due to the fact that they haven’t updated the wait time in store, the online system haven’t processed the order in an empty restaurant, an hour after it was placed and you’ll have to wait another 20 minutes for it to be ready. Every single time. Was a great place to grab some wings but they have declined in quality so much that it’s not worth the hassle anymore.< /Review>< date>

Been to this Buffalo Wild Wings quite a few times and have never had a bad experience. The service has always been friendly and the wings have always been prepared correctly.
If your looking for a good wing sauce but not a spicy fan I suggest the garlic parmesan. What a little kick, try the Asian Zing.</review>

Ordered food online like I usually do. The store was closing early for whatever reason. I ordered a snack size (9) and fried pickles. I get home and realize they had only given me 4 wings and pickles that looked like they had been cooked hours ago. I love BWW but I won’t be ordering from here again.< /text>

That would have made my visit perfect!  It's a short walk from the Tesla Supecharger array, and a handy place for a quick snack. In short, this was not my first visit. Nor will it be my last. See you there!  (The beer selection ALMOST makes up for the lack of a chocolate shake. Plan accordingly!)< /text>< pics>

Terrible customer service. Management doesn't adequately train staff before throwing them on the floor. My to go order is now 20 minutes late on a single order of wings so I dont even know if they started making it. No communication between front of the house and back of the house. I also watched three other customers get snapped at by the manager because they interrupted her being rude to her employees behing the to go counter. 0 out 10 do not reccomend.< /Review>

Dec 7th 2019, went to BWW for my birthday. Waited 15 minutes to be seated in a half full resturant. 15 minutes to get a server to take a drink order. 15 more minutes to get the drinks. We had to tell the server to go get them. Server asked 2 times what kind of salad dressing we wanted. Then we had to ask for the dressing when he brought salads with no dressing. We asked how big the tenders were, he said "decent". I had to get up a refill my own drink. Waited 45 minutes for my meal. What dump.</Text>

So now it's just so so wings.

This is a great place to come between 4 and 6 p.m. Especially on Tuesdays when they have half-price original wings. The bartenders are great! We like to order the wings extra crispy with the sauce on the side. Yum! The corona Rita's at $5.50 during happy hour are excellent. You can also get a Jack and cola for $3.50. Great place to stretch your dollar.<//review>

Had a reasonably priced lunch that took forever to prepare. So, I decided to stay and watch a soccer game to the bitter end. Was offered soda refills every two minutes. The staff were really nice and supported each other too - nice to see. Food was okay - fresh, but simple. Portions lacking a little. Would return for lunch.<//Text>

Great experience having lunch with my son.  Callie was our host and I could not have asked for better.  She put the period on a perfect morning with my son.

The Barbecue Chicken Salad was great.  My son loved the Chicken Tenders.  It is always so nice to have the staff friendly and welcoming.  Just like Callie.

For this senior citizen, Callie made the meal complete.  Thank you, Callie!< /Review>

Went to eat and watch women’s World Cup. 27 min to get a server, 10 minutes to get my beer after that, 12 minutes later I get a cold burger and fries.

When I complained to Manager he told me I was served within 10 minutes??

They lost my business and my gift card business. Worse service in 10 years. Went across BWW to Red Boys Pizza. Treated excellent and food was great!<//text>

The sports viewing experience is top notch on ordinary days. I'm not a big fan of paying a cover charge to be in the bar during fight nights or during big sports events like the Superbowl. But when those conditions are not in effect, this is a once-a-week spot for us. (Asian Zing FTW!)</review><user_name>Vincent Lowe<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

My personal favorites are the Asian Zing and the traditional Buffalo wings. It is also a great beer selection. I personally love the Tricerahops. The environment is great. My daughter and I love coming here especially to watch hockey. Normally there is a lot of fun with the other sports fans!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>This place is horrible, I placed and order over the phone they took the order and charged my card, an hour later they decided to cancel my order because they close the kitchen at 8:30. They should have not taken my order in the first place nor charge my card! Not only that, they could have called me to let me know they had cancelled my order but they did not even have courtesy to do that. 👎🏻< /text><resp>{'time': 1597643543218, 'text': "Hey Joel.

Last night was my first and LAST time ever going to Buffalo Wild Wings. The service was horrible and the food was disgusting. The wings were bland and had no flavor the French fries were cold and tasted stale. Not only did it take the waiters like 20 mins to ask for our orders. When it was dead the restaurant was dirty our table was disgusting and nobody came to clean it!!! Never will I go to Buffalo Wild Wings. I would rather take my money to Wing Stop who actually has amazing wings!< /Review>

I waited over 45 minutes for my take out order. I asked for the honey bbq and garlic parm sauces as I can’t have spice.  I also asked for utensils as I was at a hotel.  After waiting 45 minutes I got my food. My hotel was 2 minutes away.  It was cold. Both my sauces were incorrect and spicy after specifically making sure to ask which ones were mild.  And also no utensils.   I guess a correct hot order was too much to ask for.</review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Let's start with the food. The fries are alright, I've had better from fast food joints. The cheese curd burger... Well, the cheese curds themselves weren't that great and the beef patty was too thin for the amount of veggies and cheese curds.

Now I'll turn to service. It wasn't super busy the evening I was in, but it was still a LONG wait to order our food then wait for our drinks. By the time the food came out, my burger was just above room temperature.

Seeing as this was my fist trip to a BWW, not a good first impression.<//Text>< Pics>

Went here for lunch a few times and the food was always good, the place was quiet and not busy, just a low key place to get some fried pickles and wings. I like the naked tenders. I like this location as well, I recommend coming here.< /Review>

There's a great variety of wings and they taste good. However, the restaurant itself smells strange, there often isn't that much sauce on the wings (even ordered extra wet), a lot of the food beyond the wings isn't much better than average, and the staff can be very hit or miss. Probably best if you ordered the food to go.

Update - they somehow mucked up an online order, so 2 stars for failing that.< /Text>

I am not one to ever write a review, but a shorter, Caucasian woman, probably in her 30s, was a waitress for our booth except she took forever to even take our order. As we waited a while we called over someone to see if they can take our order by now, keep in mind that it was not busy at this time. So once we got this other woman’s attention she took our order. I then noticed that a man with his kids sat down to their booth in front of us and the caucasian woman took their order quick. That was when i realized that she purposely ignored/avoided us.<//Text>

5/20
Horrible costumer service. Went in today with my boyfriend for dinner and our servers name was Chloe. She completely ignored me through out the whole time I was there and only paid attention to my boyfriend. We had asked for Pepsi but she brought us Diet Pepsi. I let her know it was Diet Pepsi and she responded, “ oh, are you sure?” And looked over to my bf and asked him if his was okay and my boyfriend told her the same thing I I had told her. She went to the soda machine and tasted it and came back with new ones and said, “ I didn’t find anything wrong with the Pepsi but here are some new ones.” After we were done she put the check in the table with a box and said, “I have separated the checks for you guys let me know if you guys need anything else.” I was confused because we did not tell her to seperate our checks, she just went out of her way to  seperate them. I found it completely disrespectful and inappropriate. I hope you guys take hands into this matter and fire her or something because I really enjoy going to Buffalo Wild Wings in Petaluma and I would hate to stop going here because of this girls bad attitude and her lack of customer service.
Thank you.< /review>

Thai curry wings are my absolute favorite! The bartenders here are awesome,friendly and fast. The only thing is they have a straight countertop bar whereas the one in Concord and Fairfield have a rounded bar .. I prefer the rounded bar. Other than that, i love it!</text>

They put our wings in a flimsy paper bag. And forgot my granddaughters order. Lady blamed me when  food ended up in the street when the bag broke.I was only offered a 15% discount to replace food. Don't waste your time there !!!!!</review>

<text>Food was very mediocre, even the wings are bad.  Burger and fries were fast food quality, but not fast food prices.  Wings tasted like they were microwaved,  sauce was odd tasting.  At least they have a good beer selection and friendly waitstaff.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x8085b3ff4860b84f:0x9c8ad8957c150e38</gmap_id></record>

First experience, and they had no bread. Which meant half of the menu could only be served if it was wrapped in lettuce. So instead of following my gut and leaving, I opted instead for the Ultimate Nachos. I got about five bites in before I stroked out from each of the ridiculouly over-salted ingredients on the table, including the boneless wings and cheese curds. In the end, three large appetizers (and three necessary waters) came to $63. I will never return.< /Review>

Horribly managed.  We had a booth near the entrance and could hear everything.  Every customer that came in was greeted with an apology.  They've apologized so much, it's habitual!  Each new customer was told that no booth was available.  There were at least a half-dozen empty booths with dirty dishes sitting on them the entire 2+ hours we were there.  One group of customers, seated outside, marched back out after waiting 30+ minutes for someone to come by.

Our experience fit the same picture.  I ordered a beer immediately and didn't get it for at least a half hour, after our food came!  Most of the time we were there, my glass was empty.  Not one dirty dish or glass was carried away during the entire 2+ hours.

On top of that, this location has really high prices.  A medium order of wings is $19.49.  Fries, potato wedges, and drinks are not included.

There is something wrong with Buffalo Wild Wings.  This location has below average service for the chain, and BWW as a whole has well below average service.  As much as I love Asian zing wings and potato wedges with ranch, I just can't justify going any more.</Review>

Very poor value as well. 17 dollars for a boneless and traditional combo that should be 10. Good beer selection but here I n cal, that could be found at way more friendly places that APPRECIATE your business. Not a chain that could care less.< /review><user_id>103162872882619266785</user_id>< user_name>

Good spot to watch sports with your friends. Lots and lots of tv's everywhere, included a massive projection screen above the bar. Huge selection of beers, a top-notch happy hour (4-6 M-F), plenty of munchies on the menu, and a friendly staff make this a worthy experience. I just wish they still showed the UFC fights...<//Review>

Food was good I normally go out of my way to eat here. Today it was busy we got our entre,food  was great . I ordered cheese cake bites what I thought would be perfect finish to a perfect meal. Once I received it I realized there was a hair long anuf to wrap around a megalithic structure. Now I have worked in the food industry for over a 10 years  so I didn't make a scene just informed my waitress about in a calm discreet manner. She took back the dessert and took it off of my bill. However I didn't receive a single apology ,or offered a remake. I would have left a tip if she at least said sorry. Idk maybe she seen me as someone trying to get a freebie either way it was a terrible  experience.</text>

This was a disaster.  First time at buffalo wild wings ever!  Had to ask where order was.  They said 15 minutes or free.  When the food "finally" for there some of it was gold and the hamburger ordered had a "burned" black bun and nor even the slightest bit of embarrassment from the server.  Complained to the manager who was apologetic but a little too late to do any good. Free coupons offered but decluned. Terrible first impressions. Wont go back.<//Review>

Hit or miss. Half the time the staff is on point and busting their tail to handle busy nights. Other times they may treat you like you shouldn't have come in at all, while they chat with their friends at tables or at the bar instead of bringing out the order that was ready 10 minutes prior.< /review>

I can't believe how bad it was. It's like they purposely tried to make the food as disgusting as possible. How can a salad with wings be that horrible at a place with wings in the title. Please dont eat here or any BWW.<//Review>

Even if you take your reciept and try to enter it yourself, you can't because it is never recognized!
Bummer but good wings if you don't care about racking up discount points...<//Review>< date>

1- Service sucks not napkins not little tray or plate for sharing.
2-We order two beers 🍺 and come 25 mins late.
3- We order special 🍸 and come with hair on it!!
4-  Try different location I don’t recommend this one 👎🏻< /Text>

<text>I'm going to give it a 3 because the wings are just too greasy. The beer is spendy, even though the breweries are within spitting distance. And - it's noisy in there. Could not even hear the football game, I had to make up my own commentary .. and .. I'll be the first to admit I suck at that.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The food is good and fairly priced, however; the service is below average. The food always seems to take too long to arrive and the servers never come to the table enough.< /text>

<review>Went to BWW to watch a UFC fight and it was standing room only. Luckily, we were able to get a booth for our group, but the manager forced us to make room and add strangers to our table. It's the first time ever that a restaurant forced me to have dinner with stranger. The food is mediocre at best and is exactly what you would expect from a chain restaurant.<//review>< userid>

What a great place to watch SPORTS! They TV's on all walls and it was super fun to hang out at.

The selections are great and our server SABRINA ALVERIO was on top of it. She is one of the best servers ever. I have never been to this place and I would recommend it to others in the area. If you like sports and want to watch them with sounds and cheering fans then go here...I hate to say it but they are now the best place in Petaluma to watch BIG Screen sports.<//review>

After placing order, an hour later no food. 2 tables who came 20 minutes after we ordered had there food ready. Staff is unresponsive.

Just recieved caeser salad, soggy and way to much vinegar. Didn't finish.

Ordered chicken sandwich, recieved chicken wrap, have to wait an extra 10 minutes for the chicken sandwich.

Chicken sandwich is over toasted and painful to eat,

Yeah, not so good.< /Text>

Typical BBW; Lots of TV's with every kind of sport on, loud, many beers on tap, and decent food.

But other than that, the wait staff can either be top notch, or the worst you have ever encountered. I have had: Charging full price on happy hour drinks, and wouldn't give a refund. Completely getting our order wrong, and then charging me not only for the screw ups, but also the ones I actually ordered. And don't go to any BBW if there is a PPV event there, they never told us we were going to be charged 25 dollars automatically until after we ate our food and got our bill. That took corporate to get my money back on that. (25 per table is to cover what they have to pay for the event is what we were told)

We have been back there a couple times, and it has been better, its decent wings, and you can go yell at tv if your sports team is on.</Text>

(Translated by Google) A place was advised by a friend. He said that the sensations will be remembered for a lifetime. When we ate the wings before crying, looking at each other. The service is good.

Место посоветовал друг. Сказал, что ощущения запомнятся на всю жизнь. Мы когда съели крылышки до плакали смотря друг на друга. Обслуживание хорошее.< /text>
