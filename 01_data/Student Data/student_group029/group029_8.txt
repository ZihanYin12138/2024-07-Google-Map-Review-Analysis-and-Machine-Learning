I had multiple issues with Ian's Movers:

(TL;DR They scratched my floor during the move and refused to pay for repair or fix it.)

1. They did not tell us that their pricing was $117 per hour only if paid in cash - the day of, we were informed the day of the move that it was $127 per hour if paid via card.

2. The move itself was generally fine - they got the job done. They were careful to wrap the furniture nicely so it was protected. HOWEVER, they scratched the floor of my new apartment. While I was hanging around as they moved my stuff, I saw one mover drop a piece of furniture and say "Oh shoot!" After the chaos of the move, I examined the floor where it was dropped, and there was a scratch that couldn't be wiped away. There were additional scratches located on other parts of the floor.

3. I understand that accidents happen and damage can occur during a move. My biggest issue is what happened next. When I contacted the company about the scratches, I asked how it would be remedied. They insisted that the movers told them they did not scratch my floor. When I informed them that I was present and saw the scratch happen in the moment, they huffed and puffed and said they'd come back to me. They went radio silent until my boyfriend very firmly communicated to them days later that they needed to remedy the issue. Shortly after, they sent a handyman to look at the damage. The handyman attempted to wipe away the scratches, which could not be wiped away with water or chemicals. To add insult to injury, the handyman suggested that we simply tell our landlord that the scratches already existed when we moved in. We were offended that we were asked to lie, but also upset that this "solution" could result with us getting stuck with the bill upon moving out down the road. Despite emailing the company once more regarding the result of the handyman visit, I received no further communication from them. There has been no offer to fix or reimburse for the cost of repairing the scratched floor.<//Text>

Excellent service. Fast, communicative, and when they encountered an issue with my previous apartment building (through NO fault of theirs), they still stepped in and made it right. Gotta love a company with integrity.

Thanks guys!!< /Text>

Den and crew showed up right on time, not a minute late, and got to work right away. They were extremely professional, efficient, and thoughtful with all of my personal belongings. Everything arrived at my new location intact. They even made a quick stop for me that was not scheduled. I could not be happier with this moving company!! I will definitely use them again in the future and will recommend to all my friends</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I hired Ian's movers for a medium sized job. Two bedrooms, a kitchen and a den. The movers were great. They wrapped and handled all the furniture with delicate care all while being very efficient. After arriving at the destination, I was amazed with how fast, yet careful the team was. I will absolutely be hiring them again if I need to move.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

These guys were super professional, showed up on time, and were super fast doing a full pack move. I can't pack everything myself, but they did an exceptional job with all of the packing. Nothing got broken!

On the actual move over, they were prompt and really, really fast. I also really loved dealing with them - have been burned before and will definitely use these guys in the future.</text>

I had to rearrange some existing furniture and they helped to unscrew things, wrap mattresses, and helped me store and sort.

<Text>I have never used a moving company before and you too my work schedule was not able to be home when the move occurred - which further stressed me out.
They packed protected everything and I moved  to the precious location within my new apartment. I have an oversized sofa and they tried everything to get that thing into my house. Their efforts and efficiences were appreciated.<//Text>< Time>

<text>Denis was great. He and his partner arrived on time and packed our stuff into his truck very efficiently. We moved all of our furniture and a bunch of boxes from our 2 bedroom in San Gabriel to Studio City in just about 3 hours. They were careful with our things and had a bunch of tools to help us with the move. Would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking to move in LA.</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Name>

<Review>1 )Movers were one hour late. This completely threw off my schedule and I wasn't able to be there to supervise the move. The move was supposed to easily take 3-4 hours. It ended up being a 6 hour move. And I was charged full price.

2)The movers forgot (or neglected) to move half my kitchen. Of course I wasn't aware of this until my old landlord called to tell me a few days later. So I had to leave work early and finish moving my kitchen.< /Review>< Pictures>

We used Ian's Movers and they were fantastic. Sergio and Eli were very professional. They arrived on time and ensure that our property was well protected. They made it look so easy and effortless. I can highly recommend them. If and when we move again - We will be using Ian's Movers! Great value too.<//Text>

Serge and Anton were absolutely fantastic for my move today! They are passionate about doing a great job on every detail, they're dedicated and efficient to get the job done well and fast. We moved a 1 bedroom apartment in the Los Angeles area and they truly made my move seamless. There was a lot to move but they nevertheless managed to make it feel very light to me. They wrapped all my furniture to ensure none of it would get dirty. I will work with them again and would recommend them to anyone else! Absolutely perfect work!</Text>

<review>We hired 2 movers to move from our 2 bedroom house in San Gabriel to a 2nd floor apartment in Studio City. Denis and Arthur showed up within the promised time frame, got everything loaded in the truck carefully and efficiently, and unloaded everything in under 3 hours. Least stressful move I’ve ever had and would absolutely use them again.< /review>< Resp>

Rudy and his team did a great job!  We had a lot of stuff and some really insanely heavy plants, and lots of designer furniture, lots of fragile stuff.   Nothing at all got broke. The guys work fast. They were super nice.  Great experience, highly recommend, will definitely use again.</Review>

Rudy, Ivan and Jerry do not mess around! For our move from Altadena, they loaded the truck with amazing efficiency, using every inch of available space. In the hundred degree heat, the crew was entirely pleasant, positive, and self directing. They worked miracles.< /review>

<review>Sergei and Krock were fantastic! They arrived early, went above and beyond helping us with our stuff! They came on time, were professional, efficient, and even helped us wrap up the last few boxes of stuff. I would recommend them to anyone! They made an usually stressful experience (even more stressful since I was moving from Long Beach to Culver) a walk in the park!</review><date>1488066333717</date>< rate>

<review>I would leave 0 stars if possible.

Stay away from them, they will not take no for an answer and will continue to call and harass and leave voicemails and do nothing but make planning to move more stressful than it needs to be. Even after being blocked they will continue using different numbers and going straight to voicemail.

Take a hint and leave people alone!</review><user_name>Jacob S</user_name>< gmapID>

<Text>I’m a very busy man with a demanding career i work 10 to 12 hours 6 days a week. I’ve known Sahara for a long time and i have gone to many club in OC past and present. When I need alone time for myself I stop by here in rare instances and spend a good amount here. I’ve met some of the lady’s and I can say it’s the cleanest and safest club in OC no other club has anything like it when it’s about the lady’s and good customer service. The reason is they have a diverse selection of lady’s and they treat you like a king, personally I like small talk before asking for a dance there like pro customer service reps with bikinis but better dancers! Believe me I’m not simping I just like to enjoy a good view and relax.<//Text>< GmapID>

<time>1580817117444< /time><Review>Cool place. Went on a week day for my birthday and more personal service and enjoyed it. The entry for 30 dollrs a person even on a weekday even girls and an hour or so before closing is all just things that make it worse Very big and popular clubs in Hollywood are better, busier and stay open later and the most expensive is 25 per person during busy times and girls are ten off from that. They also 90 percent of the time are 15 dollars for men and let girls in free. The owner should consider lowered entry fees on a scale depending on how busy it is and day of week etc and or give away free lap dances with entry fee or something. I actually would have already been back again if it wasn't for the entry fees for me and my fiancee just to enter was 60 bucks on a Tuesday and the attitude of the doorman and the security guard having an attitude about is questioning the pricing it would have gotten a perfect score hopefully they consider it so me and my fiance will definitely go back seeing we definitely like it and the girls are amazing but not going to pay 60 in entry fees just to walk in ever again.< /Review><user>103622993593736172553< /user>< Resp>

<Text>This is my overall place to go in orange county prices reasonable. Girls tend not to be pushy. I ve been coming here since my 18 year birthday. I am not some one who goes on a weekend basis but if i feel the need to see some beauties this place is the first place that pops up on my mind.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This place is terrible. I have been to numerous gentlemen’s clubs and this is by far the worst. Atmosphere reminds me of my aunts basement. Please do not waste your money ($20 admission) by coming here. They don’t sell alcohol here. It would help the dancers look better.<//review>

Hit and Miss, I have been here a few times. Sometimes is it great other times it sucks.
Cons- This place is small.   no alcohol.  Expensive cover with softer drink minimum, only a few hot chicks.

Pro- full nude, friendly girls, cheap and convenient. Some girls are prettier than others, some are too old and should hang up their g-strings.

Hotter girls down the street at Fritz's, plus better food and drinks.<//Review>

This place is great...the only thing that is kinda annoying is that some girls that I want a dance from never come around and ask...they kinda just stand there and play with there phone....it looks like they don't even want to be there...which makes me not want to be there too...</Text>

There's maybe 2 girls that are remotely attractive there, bar tender asks you to buy drink for the stripper who's giving you a lap dance. I'm already giving you guys my money haha. Have some decency about it. There's better strip clubs. Will be sticking to imperial girls lol . Sahara thanks but no thanks< /text>< pictures>

Husband and I went here on a whim. We LOVED it! Music was good, and the women we very beautiful and talented. We both fell in love with Nicole, she gave us a couples private dance she was very friendly,super sweet and very hands on! It was a great experience. Thanks Nicole! We will be back for you, for sure. We have been to a few gentlemen's clubs as a couple. Most dancers will not approach us since we are a couple. But not here if anything we drawed attention. It was a welcomed change.</text>

<text>This ugly girl, that's should be on my 600 pound life, kick us out for texting, without giving us a notice. Plus, the bouncer said there is a sign, which we are suppose to read every sign, for not texting. I wouldn't go to this place, if it was the last strip club on earth.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Very nice updated restaurant on the inside. Looks clean and elegant. The  cheese wonton appetizers are very delicious! Walnut shrimp meal was also amazing. Big portions and combo comes with fried rice, chow mein, and an egg roll. Wasn’t expecting the food to be that good but turned out amazing! Gonna be definitely coming back here again.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjMUiGcsTWCzzfzEK8CVvn4U2T0L04uO2CJcSm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVvdj_B3Sez4FaPuYc8O4zP4XoL_D7pOUfd6EQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWOQrI6Mj_Ovq2MCge6ZOFqmF0OBt_zEyi3RYP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwpWy6r5iq1fSZfeU51luiDd7fzzzCiVeDKShS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyJBZIgFcmW8Nf3o5CWyMEAlpFQ2qyWY7o__12=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Yesterday was the first time we went to this fine restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the efficient service, with the finest  meal and wine and with the decent payment. We will no doubt go back there in a short time.</review>

This place is a local favorite and rightfully so! The restaurant staff treat all of us like a family and create a nice environment for locals to dine-in (pre-covid). The food is delicious and fresh, every.single.time! We love to eat here and dine-out because of the delicious menu items and the warm environment they give off for customers.< /Text>

Stopped for a quick lunch and it was great! Typical lunch menu but portion sizes were generous and tasty.  Staff was friendly and courteous.   I watch regulars come in and they were greeted like family!  It great place to eat in Rio Linda!< /Review>

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the staff is always very friendly. They serve all of the usual dishes one might associate with similar places around town. I usually order the walnut shrimp with the house fried rice and the cream cheese wontons. The quality is consistent and the service is fast.  They have lunch and dinner specials for groups and individuals, and takeout is available. I'm not sure if they've hooked up with any delivery services yet, but not as far as I'm aware.< /Text>

<Text>We've eaten here a handful of times since Elaine and family took over. The food is amazing! Love the General Chicken, the Eggplant and especially the Salt & Pepper String Beans. I really, really hope they stay in Rio Linda for a long time, great people doing great things!< /Text><UserId.>104843675670098181898</UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Good food. My mother has to be hospitalized if she eats peas or lentils and we specifically asked the waitress if one of the dishes had peas she said no. We received the plate of food full of peas. We explained to the waitress the problem that my mother's throat swells up and she has to go to the hospital and may potentially die if she has an allergic reaction. She apologized and said she will make a fresh one with no peas. She returned with a plate of food that still contains peas they had simply picked out the peas and try to serve it to someone who is deathly allergic to peas absolutely ridiculous. I personally believe that the health department should shut this place down until they can hire staff that has gone through proper training and is able to communicate in English.<//text>

Got two take outs to eat at home after a long day at work and opened one up to take a quick bite because it was the first time I've eaten here and ended up eating both of them in the parking lot lol. Well worth the weird looks by passerbys.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I ordered a vegetarian dish and the dish had eggs in it. I explained to the server that I don't eat eggs since I am a vegan. I also offered to pay for the replacement dish. Not a problem.  My dish was replaced with a smile. No extra charge. Will definitely visit again.< /review>< gmap_id>

This is a pretty good place to sit down and have a nice Chinese dinner at a decent price where you can feed the family. You can also order it for takeout. The staff is friendly the service is relatively fast and the food is delicious! I recommend you at least try it if you're looking for some Chinese food in the Rio Linda area< /Review>

Horrible service. No thank you. No hello. Nothing. I can accept mediocre service but this was the worst.

Here for lunch. Soup tastes like it came out of a can. Ordered a soda that was warm.

No spring roll on my plate. Chow Fun is heavily soaked in grease.

Stay away from this dump!!!< /Review>

Been customer there for many years.  Shockingly it beca me under new ownership recently with no idea.  Food not quite as good and new menus and prices.  Wait staff was pleasant but quality of meals substandard in my opinion.</review>

< Review>
Best lasagna ever! Meatballs are to die for! Pete and Maria are awesome people and make the best Italian food I have ever tasted. They always treat us real good. Even when there are 16 of us and 10 other customers, the service is excellent. I highly recommend.<//Review>

<text>Great place, friendly atmosphere. I ordered the lasagna, which came with two meatballs and a choice of salid or soup.  I got the clam chowder soup.  Both tasted great.  Highly recommend for a good Italian restaurant.  But expect it to be a little pricey but worth it.<//text>< Rate>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>The reviews convinced me to eat here. Now I'm convinced the reviews are posted primarily by friends of employees because this place was awful.

My wife got spaghetti. It tasted like they add minimal seasoning to canned tomato sauce. The meatballs were dry and had no flavor of their own, like unflavored overcooked hamburger. My plate was average. Ravioli taste okay. Similar to what you'd get at a decent buffet. I didnt completely hate it, but I wouldn't recommend it.

This meal could have been salvaged if there was good service, but they failed there too. I am a former server, and I could clearly see this guys lack of effort. I don't know if it was a bad day, bad training or if he is just a bad server, but there was a complete lack of desire to improve our experience.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Pete and Maria's Italian Bistro

Great family place with great Italian cuisine!

From minestrone and fresh bread,  to lasagne,  fettuccini,  to pizza great flavors, great experience.

Owners and staff are amazing and make your visit truly enjoyable.
Always welcoming.<//Review>< Pictures>

I love that the smaller places can carry the bins full of just about everything one could need and stay in business at the same time. Had to locate some brass fittings for a plumbing project and neither the blue or the orange aprons had what I needed. This ace did however have what I needed.<//review>

You can buy online and pick up, just call them and they will bring the hardware to your car. Just need to sign for it ( bring your own pen).</Review>

< Review>
I first started using Cannings for over 20 years and continue to use them as my “go to” hardware store.
Although I have Lowes, Home Depot and a True Value all within the same vicinity, the fact that I make Cannings my preferred store must say something.  I don’t have to hunt for someone to help me and in many cases the prices are the same or less at Cannings.  I quite frankly liked Cannings before they modernized and joined the Ace group.  It was truly an old school store but it’s still a good and well stocked store.  It's a good sign when you always see professionals shopping at Cannings.<//Review>

This place is the best. I had a broken key I needed copied  and they did it in about 2 minutes. Home depot made me wait 20 minutes to talk to someone only to tell me it couldn't be done. This is my go-to place now! Fast and friendly service!</Review>

I am so glad I came into this store and received outstanding service. Vincent was helpful and courteous from the moment I came into the shop. Oscar went above and beyond to also assist with his sales knowledge. Thank you to both of them for making my tire purchase less stressful.</Review>

This shop is great, they know how to get the job done and quick. Oscar is a true asset to this shop. I will be back in another 40,000 miles for my 7th set of tires for my truck and or one of my family's vehicles. Best prices right out of the gate.<//Text>

<review>I always come to the Camarillo Location in old town. The Manager Oscar helped me out. Gave me a great deal to get my car back out on the road running. I really appreciate their honest work, it's a relief when you have dealt with bad mechanics in the past. Thank you American Tire Depot!! -Alex</review>< pics>

< Review>
After two other tire stores that couldn't help me because it was after 5:00pm on a Saturday, they did! They took me at 5:30 and worked on it until after 7:00. They replaced both front tires and did an alignment. It was an emergency because there was very little tread and it was pulling; daughter driving to Temecula from Camarillo with two small kids. They had to be there at 8am for a soccer game! Staff were outstanding to help me out that late! Thank you!< /Review>

<review>Excellent service here. As I was heading out, I noticed a noise which sounded like some thing in my tire. I pulled over and saw it was a nail. Came right back home and called to see if I could possibly get in at this late part of the day. The gentleman who answered (Jordan?) managed to get me in before  closing and even charged nothing for the very small repair as a new member of the Camarillo community. I will absolutely be back, I am super grateful to have chosen this place!</review>< UserId.>

<review>Brought my CTS in for alignment, balancing and tire check. They aligned and balanced the vehicle for a good price and instead of telling me how badly I needed tires, they said the car wasn’t ready for new tires. This is a tire shop not trying to sell me something I don’t need. Honest, fair prices, good work. I recommend American Tire Depot Camarillo.<//review>< pics>

<Review>I scheduled an appointment for new tires over the phone this past Saturday for Monday at 4:00 pm. When I got there, the guy told me he can't help as his tire guy quit on the weekend. I asked him why he didn't notify me and he said " I didn't think you were coming". uhhh, okay.

I went home and tried to call several times on Monday and today (Tuesday) to reschedule and I wasn't able to get a human on the phone, it just kept saying there was an error after maybe 5 or so minutes and hung up. I was able to get service on the website via chat, and they were great and responsive, however, when I asked them to send me an invoice,  it showed the wrong tires. I even gave the rep who booked my appointment on Saturday the exact item number from the website.  Maybe I'm unlucky but how can they get so many things wrong?</Review><username>Hong T</username><user>102970723901500662806<//user><Rating>1<//Rating>< gmapID>

Last week on Saturday 2-6 / 2021 I went to ask for an estimate for the alignment of my truck, the first thing I looked at seemed very respectful, the person in charge of the establishment, he stared at the rear of two girls who arrived, , does not use the mask, they are too loose to do the jobs!!! I stayed two hours and they didn’t do anything at all to my truck,,, I just want to let you know, if you want to go to this place especially the woman,, be careful!!!< /Review>

They have this advertisement about a “ free patch”. Then when I got there I signed the papers and everything and then when I pulled up with my car to park it, the guy that was working walked to my car and said that they couldn’t fix it in a rude way in which I don’t know why they couldn’t fix it when it was just a simple nail in there. After , he then said that I had to get a new tire and they couldn’t just patch it.</text>

Came in with no clue what was wrong with my car, to be honest I thought it was on its last legs but the shop workers did an incredible job at fixing it and were always in contact with me about issues to make sure I was informed. I haven’t been to many auto shops that have this level of care and just honest good natured ness to them. Will be back in the future for all tire needs.</review>

<review>I’ve gone into this tire store twice, over a couple of years.  The employees were above and beyond courteous.  The first time, I had a flat tire.  They repaired it and sent me on my way, for no charge.  I live out of town, in Arizona, but my daughter lives in Camarillo.  I Remembered the good service that I received, so I went back when I had weird noises coming from my tires, or drivetrain.  They found a left front wheel bearing going out, and 2 rear shocks leaking hydraulic fluid.  Since my car was still under factory warranty, they sent me back to Mazda.
I almost bought a set of tires from them, but we couldn’t get the wheels off (couldn’t find wheel lock key).  Anyhow they’re really good at what they do, and I would recommend them for sure.

Ask for John! I will always purchased my tires at American Tire Depot in Camarillo. John was professional, courteous, patient and understanding. I had to reschedule my appointment,  he still Installed my tires  and they did not finish until after closing. He never made me feel rushed or that I was standing in the way of their going home.
This was my second time of patronizing this business. They are all great guys there👍🏾💕<//Review>

As always, Robert and his team were very professional and this is my 6th visit to buy tires for family and friends.  Took my BMW sedan for a needed tire inspection as I just got a flat, damaged the tire beyond repair driving on the 101 freeway.
Arriving late in the day ... Robert immediately ordered the high performance tires to meet my specifications and they arrived the next morning for installation.  Great service as always from this location.
I have stopped price comparing as you will not find a better deal in Ventura County.  I was in the car business for years and have used many others before exclusively using Robert the last 6 years.  Robert knows the competition well and you will not be disappointed.
Thank You again Robert for taking care of my tire emergency.<//Text>

Robert was helpful in helping me get the tires I needed for my car. Great customer service and Best Prices! The guys in the back did a Great Job! My car drives smooth and feels safer! Thank you ATD Camarillo Crew!

1/27/2021
One of my tires had a tear last Saturday. Called ATD to see if they could replace it since I got the warranty when I replaced all four and they were very helpful. They ordered the tire and replaced it for me on Tuesday in 30 minutes! Thank you for your great service!< /review>

<Text>Needed new tires so I headed off to Costco thinking that would be the most cost effective choice.  They quoted me an incredibly high price and when I asked about the tires and why they were so costly they had a take it or leave  it attitude.  I then looked on Yelp and American Tire Depot got great reviews.  So I called them.  What a huge difference in service!!!  The quoted me three different tires and Wales me through the differences.  Then they were kind when I had to delay the installation two hours because of unexpected company.  They also checked the alignment and let me know it was off.  They quoted me a price to complete it as well and waited for me to call back while I called my dealership and a couple other places to find the price they had quoted was very competitive.  I called back and they then did the alignment as well.  When I have to buy tires again, which should be awhile since they walked me through gh what steps I need to take to get the most miles on these I’ll be headed back to American Tire Depot!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

Rude worker and not given enough info was enough for me to not go back. He wasn't welcoming to a new potential customer, maybe he was having a bad day?  Either way, it wasn't a good experience for me, sorry if I interrupted his day.</review>< Pictures>

Numerous bad experiences. 2 years ago I hit pothole and tech swore my rim was in perfect condition and was unbent. Wrong. Driving on it for months not feeling right then had to get it fixed at dealership. Nail in tire few months later- response was "sorry, closing soon and don't have time to fix. Bring it back 2 days from now." Last week's visit was because I heard a strange noise coming from wheel, mechanic drove it like a maniac with Windows up and claimed he couldn't hear anything. He claimed it was  probably bearings or brakes but didn't have time to fix anyway -- and Don't come back the next day (Tues) because they didn't have any techs scheduled.
Yeah. Some warranty I got- can't ever use if I'm I'm constantly told they don't have time for me.
Went to mountain view and in 5 minutes they figured out my problem: some type of tool or protective piece was left between my rim and tire.
I won't ever be back. I need all new tires and DEFINITELY won't buy from this company.</Text>

Bought new tires on April and American Tire Depot has a nice selection & prices. Staff makes you feel comfortable and confident in your purchase.  I stopped in recently to have my tire pressure checked. Very prompt service. After discussing tire pressure issues, I decided nitrogen was the option for me. Only took a few minutes and I can stop by anytime if needed. Definitely recommend American Tire Depot!<//review>

Showed up with a flat tire purchased at a different branch. Robert got me hooked up with a fresh one, honored warranty, and had me on my way quickly so I could get back to work. Thanks Robert and the guys in the warehouse.</review>

Mike was AWESOME!! He was able to get our car repaired in a timely manner. I took the car to other places, and I was quoted higher prices and a longer waiting period. Going forward, I am taking all of our cars there.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Resp>None</Resp><Review>I'm writing this, my first ever review, because of the excellent experience I had.  The manager was very kind, jovial, and always presented a smile.  He provided a price to replace my tires that set the bar for others to match.  I returned to him because of his friendly, straight forward approach.  He offered a service to take me to, and return me from work while my tires were being replaced.  Ultimately, I had a friend drop me off right before he closed.  When I called to say that I was cutting it close on time, he laughed and stated he wouldn't leave me stranded.  Lastly, when I picked up my car, he surprised me with a better quality tire (including road service) for slightly less than the price we settled on for the original tires.  Being skeptical, I checked the date code on the tires and found they were new (manufactured the precious month).  I don't know many businesses that would do this!  I found this impressive enough to share and state that I will be returning for future service and recommending this place to others.  It is important to note that my experience only involved the tire service.  I would expect the same treatment for other services.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I spend very little time waiting for my car to be serviced and that is such a plus!  The team here in Camarillo have a sense of urgency when it comes to my car and they rush to get the job done. I get the red carpet treatment every single time I step through the doors. I am a loyal customer who wants you to know how I am treated is probably a good indicator of how they treat everyone. The prices are reasonable too so put all that together and you can’t go wrong✌🏼Ask for Brett, this is a guy who knows how to give you the best deal in town And he’s friendly too<//Text>

Whatever you do don't get your tires for your bmw here. I had to go back there three times. Wouldn't hold air in tire that i spent over $1k for. They told me i would need new wheels. Took it to another toe place and they told me they made a mess of it and didn't clean it correctly. Needless to say I haven't had a problem since.<//review>

First time I replaced the tires on my car; couldn't find the key to my locking lug nuts. These guys went to the dealer and convinced them to give me a $127 part for free to unlock my wheels and got my tires replaced on time. Superior service, competitive price.</Review>

< Review>
Brett was awesome. Easily beat all my local dealers on Toyo open country at2. They definitely earned my families business.

****Update****

Beware: Initially I received a good deal here for tires. Then after picking my truck up I noticed 2 scratches on the side panel of the door. The manager on shift Brett was nice about it and the GM told me to take the truck to get it fixed and they would pay for it. I did, got it fixed at the dealership, and 1 month later I’m still missing the 1k I paid out of pocket to get this fixed. Now when I call the number it goes straight to voicemail.< /Review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Popped a tire on the 101 yesterday. So we decided to make an appointment for 11am. Got there 10 minutes early and they said it would be 30 minutes to approx 40 minutes. We come back an hour later with my husband, 9 month old, and mom who is visiting in town. They hadn't even started on the car yet. So we decide to go next door to the awesome coffee shop and wait. We come back after an hour and a half to be rudely interrupted and told to "just sit down and wait a few more minutes". The old man in from was extremely rude with zero customer service. After that point we were ready to leave and gladly took our business elsewhere. We will probably never go back there because of the lack of customer service. It would have taken a quick phone call to let us know they didn't have the tire for us to consider going back there. Horrible place of business!</review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Was told I had an appointment at 2:00pm. Arrived promptly at 2:00pm. Was told I would have to wait at least 30 minutes before I my tires would be located. They immediately took one wheel off of my car so i could not leave and then had me wait for an hour and a half before they started rotating the tires.
During the time I waited not one other car showed up for service</Review>

Bread save the day for me. Planning a trip to San Francisco trying to save money fixing my car up before I take such a large trip. Go to have my tires checked at America's Tire. Where I am told my warranty is void there is no discounts for me and my allinment
is destroyed. Distraught I left and got an oil change at Jiffy Lube. I asked them who they would recommend tires they told me American Tire Depot on Ventura. Made some calls checked other prices found Ventura Tire Depot with cheapest. Had Brett look at my struts and Alignment he told me I needed Replacements on the front but the back was fine. Brett met my expectations and then blew them out of the water.< /Text>

< Review>
DO NOT BRING YOUR VEHICLE HERE!!!  I am not one to write negative reviews however; Wish I read these other terrible reviews before bringing my land cruiser here.  Needed a flat repair and balancing.  They repaired the flat but made the balance worse.  When I brought it back to bring it to their attention the manager Z. Davis acted incredibly unprofessionally arguing with me while trying to resolve the issue.  He actually raised his voice as though I was a child.  Unbelievable. No one should have to go through this.  After several ill attempts to get him to rectify the situation he eventually put the wheels back on the machine but did not completely balance them out.  Will not come back here.  Filing a complaint with corporate as well.</Review>

Can I choose no stars???  Purchased tires for my son and not even 1 year later they are toast!  He only drives in town And barely putting 10k miles and of course this place could care less and of course blames the consumer..."Did you change the spark plugs?? Did you do this?? Did you do that?..they ask....seriously?  The times of taken accountability do not exist here.   I will be honest and say at the time of purchase they were friendly and accommodating.< /text>

<Text>Got a flat on a tire and came here, was told they had to order my tire which was no big deal and that it would arrive in a 2 days since I am moving out of state. Didn't receive a call for 4 days and when i attempted to call the number listed it makes you jump through hoops just to lead to an answering machine that no one probably listens to. I then went in person to see what was going on and there was no record of my order or anything. This really put me in a bad spot since I am moving out of state. They seemed completely unorganized and I was better off going to Americas Tire where they helped me in a few hours. This place was a complete waste of time and put me in a difficult spot.</Text><Response>{'time': 1525795943933, 'text': 'Hi Mike. I apologize for your disappointing experience with us.

< review>
Had America's tire put tires on my F350 four years ago and recently went there to have a tire repaired. The technician realized the tires they had installed back then were not rated for my size truck so they ordered and installed new correct sized tires this week at no charge.  All i paid for was the road hazard warranty,  $133.00!
That is a classy move by them!
They could have just fixed my tire and said nothing.

< review>
Brought my car here for tire pressure sensor replacement (1) and tire rotation ($101) before a 2400 mi. road trip.  The sensor was replaced but they did not balance the wheel after removing the tire to replace the sensor.  Also one of the wheels had a distinguished mark on the valve.  That wheel was still in the same position after the "rotation".  So they didn't balance nor rotate the wheels!  The car vibrated like crazy for the 2400 mi. trip, until I had it balanced correctly in Wisconsin.
I let their corporate office know that I won't be going to any American Tire Depot stores.  I can't trust them.

Update:  I just learned that these Bozo's installed one of my new tires BACKWARDS too!  OMG!  If you value your safety, don't go here.<//review>

<pics>None<//pics><review>One of my drivers had a nail in his tire...so he stopped by to see if it could be repaired. The tech fixed the tire and charged nothing. It was fixed in 10 minutes. I don't know of any pace that would do this. The driver 1st when to Firestone to fix it. It's where I have been going since I opened our business in 2007.... but was told 2 hours wait. We buy all our tiers at Firestone. I will look into buying our tires here next time needed. I hope all the reviews I have read here are not true. Any how I am going back for new ones when it's time. I have 14 taxis and in need of tires all the time. I hope this place will take care of me better than Firestone

UPDATED: 3 Months Later.

I have been using American Tire Depot of Camarillo now for The Last 3 Months, Being a Taxi Cab Business owner I am in need of their service quiet often.  I am happy I made the switch from Firestone to here.....the service is 5 star....I can tell that the people here... enjoy their job....It really shows. The price is almost the same like 10 bucks less here at American Tire Depot.....but it's not at all about the money.....it's all about the service....if it was about the money I would have never continued to give Firestone my business for so long ,,,,like 10 years or more,,,.......Thanks Guy's

<text>I was thrilled when I had my tires put on, but then when one of the four seemed to be defective, Zack was instantly throwing attitude at me when I phoned to see what I should do. I did NOT appreciate being talked to as if I had damaged the tire over him being helpful in helping resolve the issue. I will think twice before dealing with them again. I would caution against purchasing from them just to save a little money, when they assume you're at fault when/if something goes wrong.</text>< Pictures>

DONT GO HERE!
I had a flat, and could see a nail right through the threads.  Unfortunately, this was the only place open on Sundays.  I dropped off the tire, and the technician looked at it and says, Yeah we can fix that.  I left the tire there, because I didn't need it right away.  I called 4 hours later and was told "the tire was too worn to repair, there wasn't enough treads left and I would need to buy a new tire"  I had just had my tires rotated and inspected 5 days before and knew there was enough tread left.  I told them I would come get my tire back.
On Monday, I took to my normal tire shop, the technician measured the tread, says he can fix it while I wait.  He comes back in 10 minutes and shows me he cant fix it because someone has already tried to repair it and messed it up!
Horrible Customer Service
1) Didn't call me
2) Didn't own up to bad repair
Don't Go there!!< /Text>

Bought a set of tires here and had the alignment done. Everything was fine until I picked up the car and the horn no longer worked, they claimed it was already like that and refused to fix it. I took it home and found all the horn wires were snapped off at the horns, I resoldered the wires and that fixed the horn. After about a month I developed a slow leak in one of the tires, since I had the road hazard warranty I took it back right before a 5,000 mile road trip I had planned. I left the car with them and they claimed to fix it. After two days into my road trip I checked the tire and found it had the same slow leak. I took the car to a Big Brand tire in Jackson, WY. After a couple of hours and $20 bucks later the tire was fixed, I asked Big Brand about the leak and told them I had it previously fixed, to which they told me that they found a screw in the tire and not a single repair or patch. American Tire had just aired up the tire and called it good, I will never shop here again.<//Text>

Horrible service from all especially rude Manager. We have taken 2 different vehicles here  on different occasions and have ruined both and try to say they didn't do it. Do not that your car here. There "technicians" broke 3 of the tire studs on one vehicle and let us drive off like that.(which is very dangerous) and without telling us,they obviously don't know how to do the job.<//text>

I received terrible customer service from the manager at American Tire Depot in Camarillo. He was very vague about pricing and never wrote anything down for me to see. I specifically asked for a blinker to be replaced and he said he did not have the part. I sat there for three hours and he did not tell me this until the last minute. Lastly, because he was changing the rotors I asked for a price on break pads. He gave me a high price and then lowered the price after I told him that  I spoke to my father about pricing and that his price seemed a little high. I was very offended by his condescending behavior and poor attitude. I will not return to American Tire Depot and I will advise others to do the same.<//Text>

Dressbarn cashier careful what you say to customers.  Its not good to hear "you're lucky you get to go home and I have to be here till 10".
My response was,  I work all week!

Sorry, this isnt what i want to hear when I'm shopping.  I hear enough complaining, don't want to hear it when i come to your store.<//text>

Horrible customer service. This lady (Gailene) told me she was going to get the phone i wanted, she made me wait like 15 minutes she when she saw me she said: i’m sorry i forgot to tell you we don’t have that phone 😒She forgot about about me and they were not even busy! Next time i’ll go to a different location.</review>

I just want to give a big thank you to Alicia for helping me get my new account set up. She was very sincere and kind. She went above and beyond to make sure I left a satisfied customer. I will definitely be referring friends and family to this location because of her great customer service. Thanks again!!!<//Text>

However my insurance says I have 60 days after I break my device to get it fixed. He claims it could be fraud however you can clearly look at my bill and tell I've been paying $15/month for insurance for the last  2 years.

Nunca vayas a la tienda Sprint en la marina San Leandro.  Su servicio al cliente es horrible, el jefe de esa tienda le gusta estar en Los chismes con las muchachas que trabajan con El, no Les pone attencion a Los clientes.

The manager their is horrible at his job, he rather go and talk in the backroom with the girls rather than his clients I came in to ask why my bill was high and saw that the rep told me I purchased $30 a month for 12 months in accessories. I was very frustrated because all these months passed by cause I was overseas to later find out that the rep said they were free!!
I will try to get in touch with headquarters and escalate this situation!<//Text>

<review>Never step in. I couldn’t give em minus 5 star.
They are cheaters. I bought I phone x here and they gave me a tab saying free which I get confirmed for more than 5 times. Sprint also didn’t charged me for two months. But on the 3rd month I was charged $140 by the sprint. From the very beginning I had had a chat and calls regarding the same. But they answered nothing is there to pay with tab.
Now they say you are over 14 days..
what a combination of retailer and service provider.
I hate it😡👎🏿</review><Time>1516666406197< /Time><rating>1</rating><UserId.>102909823301901703449<//UserId.>< GmapID>

The manager there gave me an attitude regarding my issue, this was my second attempt for resolving my issue on my billed I purchased a phone and got quoted the wrong info my bill is twice as big now, because his employee gave me FREE accessories and later I found out the FREE accessories we're charged on my bill, when the manager step to the back to hide or give information to his employee on how to handle the situation I hear them laughing in the backroom about my situation saying that this guy won't leave and he doesn't care cause it's passed 14 days they got their commission. Like seriously don't you see that the techs room door is open and I can hear everything from the window are you serious!!!! I hate sprint I can't wait to leave sprint you guys are horrible to helping in the beginning they're you're best friend, after 14days they don't care. Change the staff please!!! Everytime I go there wether it's me or my wife they pass it on to someone else or tell me, you have to come when the manager is here or when Andrew is here, since he was the original person to sell me FREE accessories. I've had it with all these lies People if you're reading this please DON'T SUPPORT THIS LOCATION SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY GOING HERE. Out of my multiple stops at this location thru out these years ive many reps use this line, we charge taxes on Lease items. Lease isn't buying lease is renting, the taxes from what the reps say is 10% based on retail price once agreed close to the end of the transaction the rep then says "I'll waive off the taxes for some accessories" Just say no! Cause there's no such thing as taxes on a lease. The manager name is Robert and has the worst customer service ever.<//review>

< Review>
Very Poor Customer Service by all employees and Manager. They act like they own Sprint. I was there on 06/02/2016 to get help regarding my Sprint account but manager himself was telling the employees don't do anything since i did not buy Sprint account from them. Seriously??
I called the Customer Service and store Manager refused to come on phone and a lady and a guy there talked to customer service and told them we are not doing anything, manager is not here. Even Customer service people were like they can not do that.
All i want to say is do your job right, company is paying you big chunks of money to serve customers not to act like a boss but act like a servant, so people come back to you. I am one person i will tell 10 people to not to go there those 10 will tell 10 more. you figure out how much business Sprint is loosing just because of bad management. They don't need training they need to be replaced.<//Review>

Poor customer service. Laticia our sales rep started out very efficient and friendly but continue to pressure us and became aggressive and even sarcastic. Very unpleasant experience my wife and I simply walked out of the store after spending probably 45 minutes of wasted time.<//Text>

This store has the worst management and customer service.  Its employees' irreverence to customers' needs is appalling.

I made an appointment before coming in.  When I arrived there, the rep who was checking in people said that she doesn't see an appointment slot for me.  I even provided the confirmation number for the appointment.  She said she couldn't find it.  So I had to check in and wait without an appointment (which would eventually take me an hour).

The employees lie to you about your place in line.  I was told there were only 3 people ahead of me.  After they called four people, I go up to the rep to verify my place in line.  The rep tells me that I have just one person ahead of me.  After another person has been called, I go up to another rep standing in the checkin booth to verify my place in line.  She tells me that I have 2 people in front of me.  When I called them out on their bullshit, she gets testy:  'Give us a minute, alright?  Give us a minute.'

I could go on about what happened after they called my name, but I think have already made my point.  Please do not go to this Sprint store.  Even if you do, please make sure you leave a review.  If possible consider leaving Sprint altogether.  I do not see myself being a Sprint customer for very long.</Review>

The customer  service  was horrible, specifically  a worker by the name of Tim, his knowledge to answer  any of the questions  were extremely  poor, and a very  nonshalant RUDE attitude  was giving to me.He seemed more intrested  in arguing  with me the customer than helping me understand MY CONCERNS ..i felt that all the other employees  seemed  to  have made the choice just sit and watch it all go about.bottom line...this store needs to show there  paying  customers  more respect. Not just one but ALL OF THERE EMPLOYEES  SHOULD   GIVE THE  SAME RESPECT.</Text>

<Review>Signed in, i was told I was next to be see ,  and was repeatedly skipped over, asked an associate who was over seeing and greeting customers, and he said i would be next. I showed him I was next in queue, and what do you know, 5 more people in front us, who only waited at least 5 minutes while I waited 30+ minutes. Thanks for nothing.<//Review>< Pictures>

This store is full of incompetent managers and employees. Never get anything resolved and you can spend 2+ hours to get nothing resolved. Had a employee add a unwanted 3rd along with change our plan then have us return monthly in person to get a monthly credit. All of our time is valuable and they don't seem to care. Nothing has changed from the times when Nextels were hot. Screw this store, take your business elsewhere.< /Text>

Was in and out of there in 3 minutes. Horrible service.

Told them I needed something without a contract since I'm visiting for 6 months and already have a sprint phone. Apparently I have to buy one from them. I have an iPhone 4s and they can offer me a refurbished iPhone 4 instead (with a trade in) at $199 + 2 year contract.

They are inconceivably incompetent. Avoid.</Review>

I went in to get my phone repaired, and the guy behind the counter, Nelson C., goes into salespitch mode. When I tell him i just want to get my phone fixed, he goes into the back ant dells me that they don't have the parts to fix the phone.

TL;DR : very poor service, avoid if at all possible.<//Review>

<text>I have been on hold for 29 minutes 59 seconds. I'm still on hold while i'm typing this review. I was calling the San Leandro, CA store to locate a certain employee. The phone just rings rings. It was ringing so long it automatically transferred to the call center. The lady at the call center answered the phone and tried to call herself no answer. She never came back on the phone to let me know what happened. Terrible Terrible customer service.< /text>< pics>

Terrible. Phone wouldn't rotate and speaker wasn't working.  Brought it into this store and it was a waste of 90 minutes. That was 90 minutes with an APPOINTMENT! The repair "tech" (if you can call him that), checked my phone and told me I had to file a claim with the insurance company.  Called the insurance people when I got home and he told me it was a phone failure not an insurance claim which would have cost $200!!!  The tech should have known it was a phone defect and swapped the phone for no cost. Instead, they just sent me away with bad information after wasting a bunch of time. Avoid this place!!!<//review>

One of the worst customer service. Brought a Galaxy s6 to get the battery fix and got a damaged screen. Waited for around 1hour just to pick up my phone. They said that the screen was water damaged but was never put around any liquids. The employees just gather in a group and tried to avoid me. Then finally one of the employees came and told me to pay 200$ to the insurance like "REALLY?!". Really disappointed that I went to get my phone fix and instead of seeing some improvements I got it back worse.</review>

If you live around this store please don't buy Sprint, this sprint store does not help in anything. All employees and manager are ignorant, unwelcoming   , unhelpful,  non-supportive and unskilled. First thing you walk nobody welcomes you and they all stare at you. I think Sprint do need another corporate store in area or different people to work for them in this particular store. Every employee including manager have attitude issues. I have been there at least 3 times and never been welcomed and the tone they talk to you feels like you in a hood.<//Review>

I visited this store today and experienced a very disappointing display of customer service presented, it almost makes me want to cancel my contract with sprint, and go to Verizon, if you received great customer services over the phone, why not in person, do they not follow a set standard, signs of inconsistency, improve or be removed< /review>

They sold me a phone and told me a complete lie about everything just to get  commission for the sale. Totally screwed up my whole sprint billling plan, leaving stuck in contracts that he said I would be done with.  Horrible Person and a very bad  situation! Never would I go back to this sprint store!<//review>

<Text>Watched the manager get into it with a customer, I had to keep my eye on the customer as he left the store. I'm not trying to get clapped because of these two idiots... The store was really busy, too small for that area and market! The people overall were very polite to me but they did leave me hanging a number of times due to lack of service providers. I had to leave my phone, they took over an hour to tell me that it was going to be at least another two hours... I called back four hours later to see if my phone was ready or if it can even be fixed "Thanks Apple for your garbage update!" and there's no answer. Feeling left in the dark!</Text>< pictures>

Eric was great.  He was polite to me and treated me with kindness and respect.  He sold me a beautiful Porsche  with a black convertible top.  He is the best in my book!  If you want a great deal ask for Eric .  He is a true professional!!!<//Text>

Worst Mom & Pop Used Car Dealership I have ever been too. I called and set up an appointment to meet with Eric and the Manager/Co-Owner to Test drive and buy a car that I was interested in. Test drive went smooth, so I said OK, can we do the paperwork so that I can BUY this car. I was asked 2-3 different times if I was going to pay CASH or Finance(all the times I answered thru Finance). Eric even had me fill out a ON-LINE Credit application which was fine & then I was told that the CAR had been SOLD. I was the 1st person in this place and another guy had came in and drove the same car after me and said his cousin or somebody could wire the money to them. Dealerships make more $$ on Finance deals then they do Cash deals. In all, they still get paid their $$. When I asked Eric and his Manager/Co-Owner about why did you ask me to fill out a CREDIT Application if the CAR was already SOLD. Neither 1 of them could answer that question. I made sure that neither 1 of them ran my CREDIT & was TOLD NO it was not. My Fica is above 780. Go Figure. Do NOT trust this dealership with NOTHING. If you read this before calling this dealership about buying a CAR, do yourself a favor and PASS on this Austra Motors Dealership.</text>

AWFUL! Had me fill out a credit app only to find out the car i was ready to purchase was sold to someone that came in after me. The management team needs to learn that the mom & pop dealerships are getting a bad rap due to this type of customer service. Very disappointed that this is how they treat their potential customers!!!!</text>

Bait and switch. I call about a car advertise on craigslist.  I was told it was available and I could go the same day to take a look at.  I get there in about 1.5 hours, get in a similar model car to see that the mileage was not the same as the one that was advertised and told the person there that this isn't the car that I called about.  Thereafter I was told that that car was sold and this was a better deal.  I wasted my time, and money for gas driving there for nothing.  Be honest next time, if the car has been sold, state it has been sold, if you're not sure, say you don't know, you'll have to check.</Review>

My just turned 18-year-old son and I began looking for his first car to purchase for himself in May of this year. After determining what kind of car he wanted and doing lots of research, we discovered Austra Motors. Danny was amazing and helped make my son's first car purchase a father/son event we will long remember!<//Text>

I'm still waiting for my plates. It's going to get serious soon. I been nice to long. The business woman in me is about to get real bossy. I can sit here and explain other issues I had with my car since then and with them as well but I won't. Danny is the best employee there he is always trying to keep a smile on your face and reassure service. If it wasnt for him this place would gone down long ago. He understands people and he listens , listens not just listen to speak or shut you up. 2 stars because of Danny. And also be because I got a semi good deal on the final price.< /text>

<review>If I could give this place more stars, I would. From the moment we walked in the door, my sister and I were treated so sweetly. These are honest, kind, and helpful people that work here. They have a great selection of reliable cars, with great prices to go along with them. I feel like trust is such an important part of buying a car and these guys are extremely trustworthy, honest, and helpful. They made a situation I usually dread into a stress free, fun, exciting experience. If you have any question of where to buy a car, definitely go to Austra!<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdzh7XM5xrrAw-cXsWfWLjOihP7BjxL1rRhTCN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1559362262942, 'text': 'Georgina, thanks so much for the kind words.

< Review>
I submitted a credit app for a car. I had to call almost 24/7 to check on my update to see if I was approved. My credit app showed that it was already seen and it shown on credit inquiry. They didn’t call me I had to call to see if I was approved. They said I was then they said they have to wait for the manager I said ok. Then they I called again and frank said he had a customer so I had to wait 30minutes. Never got a call back or text. Today I called again and no answer. Then i received a text saying they’re waiting on the bank? For what ? I had already got approved so that means they have everything I need to know from monthly payments to what my down payment is. They truly wasted my time. I was very interested in the car I was going to buy because I just had a kid. And then I didn’t like how it ruined everything for me for a first time buyer. The sales person had no effort in calling me and I was ready to go get the car and travel. My husband is a general sales manager and it was dissapointing him also, because he knew how much I wanted that car. And it doesn’t take a whole week to sell a car. Come on guys do better!!! Y’all just lost some money!!!< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I got Hyundai Sonata 2015 Hybrid on January. I paid in full and in 2 weeks my car engine broken. I towed to them from Palm Springs cost me $950 and they said you need to take our mechanic , he will take care it , just make sure you pay half of the payment. The mechanic said its Hybrid batteries and cost $900. Austra Motors manager sait " ohhhh i am so sorry but we do not cover Hybrid battery , but we can pay $200 and you pay $700". I said ok its fine. I paid it but car still wont turn on. The mechanic said shiiit looks like your engine does not wor. That means i wasted my $700. Anyway , engine is $3499 and dealer said i pay only $1500. But on the contract he should pay %50. I towed my car to my shop and fixed $3220 and i asked my check from dealer. They always says boss is not here pls come next day pls come next day.

So , pls make sure you do not buy a car from small dealers. Or make sure you read your contract before you read. I will get my $1610 anyways but its waste time<//Review>< pictures>

Still deciding on a car to purchase. But I have to say Danny was the best car salesman I have dealt with. Very upfront and honest. He didn't pounce on us and gave us plenty time to look over vehicles. If we buy here or not, we have been 100% with the service.< /text>

< Review>
Drove 4 hours away to this dealership, because we found the perfect car online. My family and I got there super early we were got to the shop at 6:30 in the morning. We met Concepcion who was washing the car early morning. Let me tell you this man was such a sweetheart to my family & I. We asked him for help and definitely did help us. The reason why I’m giving the review three stars unfortunately when the shop finally opened we were greeted by Danny. And again we were coming 4 hours away so of course we wanted the best deal we could get. It seemed like he wasn’t understanding what my parents were telling him. My parents & I were discussing about the car together and Danny had a very bad attitude and I pointed to his watch and told us “I’ve been standing here for 15 minutes and you guys can’t make up your mind?!” Well first of its a car.. we want to make sure we’re getting a car for what we were paying for. I understand that working in sales can be difficult, I work in sales myself as well, I would never talk to a customer the way he did to my parents because he particularly lost himself a sell. My parents were furious so we walked out go to a different dealership. As we’re walking into our car we were greeted by Said. My step dad had talk to him on the phone, he was very kind, and helped us out. If Said hadn’t come to get us, we wouldn’t had gotten the car. Really appreciate Said and his hard work. As well again for Concepcion, he really touched up the car before we left the shop. But with the kinda service Said & Concepcion gave us, we will definitely be back hopefully in few months to get another vehicle for my step dad.<//Review>

If I could give less than a one star review I would do it but for everyone looking to buy from this place I advise you not to. I was tricked into making a very long journey to purchase a vehicle then when on arrival it is sold. I called 5 days everyday to check and see if the car was available an the guy said it was up until I arrive at the place then I was told it was sold 3 days prior to my arrival. The service is non caring. I was trying to help out a small buisness in the time of distress but now I see why they are such a small business. They do not carr about the customer,only making the "quickest buck possible". Do not be fooled by the low prices I am trying to save atleast one other person from my mistake with this review.</review>

I recently purchased a 2011 BMW X5 xDrive 50i from Austra Motors. The experience was not like any car purchasing experience I’ve ever had before, and I’ve purchased 26 cars... I’m 32 years old.

I purchased this vehicle during the COVID-19 pandemic and commend the staff at Austra for taking the appropriate measures to remain safe.

I was researching and shopping for the vehicle I wanted and not necessarily basing anything off of the “dealer”. My expectations for the “dealer” experience was very low.

I drove up from San Diego after finding the vehicle I wanted on Cars-dot-com. Once I arrived, I was not greeted by anyone. I walked around and spotted the X5 and checked the exterior out in detail.... looked fabulous!

A few people that appeared to be employees walked past me as I checked out the vehicle but didn’t introduce themselves so I walked inside and was immediately assisted. I figured this was a new normal customer service standard considering the covid-19 measures.

Alright, now to the vehicle. Firm price, no negotiation what so ever. CarMax pricing model? Anyways, this didn’t turn me off too much as the price was in line with Edmunds and KBB.

The vehicle was sluggish to start upon test drive. I asked several times about the battery and was assured it was just weak due to sitting in the lot. The salesperson told me after driving a few miles it would be fine. Totally reasonable and acceptable.

I drove the vehicle from LA to San Diego, parked it and the next morning it wouldn’t start. So, I jump it off and take it to the dealer. I ask for a full inspection and a quote for anything needed. I expected a few things, it’s a 2011 BMW with 70k miles.  I understand the dealers pricing is higher than a 3rd party shop. Based on my research, I can get a lot of freebies via warranty if I go to the dealer. In the end, it’s worth the higher price.

The battery, $438
Smoke was coming from exhaust upon acceleration, needed spark plugs, $1,150
BMW extended warranty covered a leaky fuel injector, awesome!
Tires (I knew this was needed) $1,200
Stabilizer and Thrust Rod $1800
Alignment $240

I enjoy driving the X5 for... 50 miles... and I’m broke down on the side of the road. I have the vehicle towed to the dealer and turns out, it’s a $2,500 high pressure fuel pump. I take care of that, and again BMW extended warranty comes through and replaced all the fuel injectors, the spark plugs, and ignition coils. So, $6,000 worth of repairs for only $2,500, not bad right? Remember, I had to pay roughly $4,800 50 miles ago for a battery and spark plugs, tires and suspension work. So now, I’m $20,000 roughly in on a 2011 BMW X5. 😎

Now, what’s my goal in this review? To let folks know, you get what you pay for. If you are shopping for your first used luxury vehicle, expect some maintenance and repair costs. Don’t take it out on the dealer. The dealers buy these cars at auction, review the car fax reports, clean them up and re-sell them. They don’t inspect these vehicles in detail. As long as they drive okay and look nice, it’s qualified to be on the lot. The dealers didn’t manufacture the vehicle, it’s not their fault the craftsmanship wasn’t the best or that the maintenance costs are high. It’s your responsibility as the buyer to do your research and know what to expect. You’re always entitled to have a mechanic check it out prior to purchase.

Fortunately I did my research and knew that the BMW N63 engine had its list of common issues. I expected $6k in maintenance the first year. I’m sure I’ll exceed that, but it is what it is.

If you’re afraid of maintenance costs, buy a Honda or Toyota, they are great reliable vehicles.

The only negative thing I can express about Austra is that I really expected them to offer me a new battery. Everything else was out of their control but the battery should be in good health on a used car sold by a dealer. I’d give them 5 stars if the battery weren’t an issue.

Austra has a great selection of used high end vehicles and I’ll keep them on my radar for future purchases.<//text>

I have a wonderful experience with Austra Motors. I was looking for a used rav4 and its hard to find a good one in market. They were referred to me and I stopped by to give a try. Although they hadn't had any in stock but I put my info and in few days they found me a great car with a great price. I'm totally happy with their service and friendly staff and definitely I recommende them. Thank you Austra motors for your great  service.</review>

<review>I have bad experience with Austra Motors,
I make two payments as down payment for the
Car the I purchase  and they only apply one of the payment to the car loan.  The other payment I guess
They keep it for their selfs,   I can’t believe they just took my money just like that.,,
I ready call them several times and they keep promising they will
Reimburse me that payment!!     but is been Over a month and they haven’t sent me a check!  They not taking my calls now  and
At this point they not given me no choice other them
Get a legal Help by in attorney,
I may even consider on cancel the loan,  and get a full refund!
I’m Very disappointed at this point!< /review>< time>

People who run the business here are just good & professional.  They made the purchase as smooth as silk.  The 2016 MBZ that I bought has no user manual and the navigation software in the car was missing but the owner promised to get them for me from the manufacturer and 3 days later, he called me to pick them up and showed me how it works.   He delivered what he promised.  Besides being honest and professional, the price is reasonable and a bit on the low side of market price.  Worth a visit before buying from somewhere else.</Text>

I purchased my 328i BMW from Austra Motors and the process was smooth and quick. Being an individual with not so great credit, This dealership was still able to fulfill my purchase request.

The BMW that was purchase lasted a good two to three months. I took it to the dealership and they told me all sorts of things. The car had accidents/ frame were damage etc. This place does a great job in hiding all the car's blemishes. Not sure which carfax they gave me, but that was also a fraudulent report. Luckily I was able to sell it off or else I would have take them to court<//Text>< Pics>

They sold me a very faulty 2007 Toyota Camry and I've been having problems with it since a year ago I have bought the car. Everything under the hood is old. Since i have bought this car I've had to replace the alternator, motor mount, radiator, water pump, spark plugs, air mass sensor flow, ALL tires, brakes, rotors, etc. it worked fine after the 1st month of purchase and since then I have put in more work and money than my down payment for this car. They told me everything was fine on the car, I wasnt going to have no problems, and now I have to basically make it brand new because it was no where close to being brand new. The key to the car that comes with the push to start key pad doesn't even work for my car. I am very disappointed in the sales person who sold me the car and basically lied to me. I was fine with buying it with no brightness on the navigation screen, but that was all that I was told that would of needed fixing. I was sold a lemon and it's not right for people to sale someone a faulty car to a first time buyer. never will I go back to you guys ever again.<//review>< Resp>

Car released to me in a bad condition and plates not sent to me in timely manner. Horrible customer service! I bought a car from this dealership, and after taking it home i noticed a few things that were wrong and should have been taken care of before releasing the car to me. The car was given to me with no gas, the tire pressure light was on due to the tires being deflated, there was no oil left. Also both filters were black and looked like they were never changed. I took the car in for maintenance right away, even though i don't believe that was my responsibility to take care of after i got the car from the dealership. But all that would have been forgotten, if I didn't run into more issues later. I was waiting for my license plate and registration to arrive, and a week before the due date I called to see why i still haven't received it. I spoke to Sayyid Garcia, who said he was the finance manager and told me that the plate was returned due to the address being wrong. He said my street name was misspelled. Why didn't anyone call me to notify me then? Okay he said he will mail it again after fixing the address. A week went by still no plates. I called again and he said he sent it on the day we spoke, and to wait a couple more days. I did and still nothing. I called again and Sayyid said that he is on a phone call and to hold on. I waited for 10 minutes, he never came back on the line. I called again and he said he will call me back. The call never came. I finally had enough, called back asking to speak to the owner and got a very nice gentlemen by the name of Danny who told me that the plates of my car were on his desk and he will personally go to the post office and mail them to me right away. Which he did and even sent me a text message with the receipt from the post office. If Danny could take care of my issue so quickly, why did it take Sayyid a month of lies to do his job which he still clearly did not do! I got the worst customer service from so called Finance manager, and thanks to Danny who saved my day! Sayyid should not have a job, since he clearly doesn't know how to do it!< /Text>

I applied on line and the next day I received a call from Anna the finance manager who gave me a great news that I was approved with the car that I really like and she got  me  5% lower interest than the other companies. Anna and the Owner are so awesome people and also their whole team they very professional.  I highly recommend to anyone to check out Austramotors first before buying a car somewhere else. They have so many luxury beautiful cars that are great prices. My wife and will be back to buy another car with this company.< /review>

<Review>This place is a joke, their warranty repair service is trash, the cars are from auctions they just repair an sale or get them from a dealership somewhere else, Bad management and salesman are scams and their finance system is a complete rip-off they mark up the price like if they where a real dealership. Overall bad I highly do not recommend this place at all.!!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Danny,

I meant to get back to you earlier but my hands have been full since my wife is out of town.   My mechanic gave the rav4 a thumbs up on thursday & I have been enjoying my car ever since.

Thank you for making this an overall positive experience.

Not even a month after I got my car from here, I already had problems with it. I took it to them twice before there 1 month or a 1,000 miles was up. They told me I could of brought my bbn own mechanic. If they are professional, as they say. They would know what they're selling and I wouldn't need to bring my own mechanic. They knew they sold me a lemon. And not only that. They arent even willing to help me out and let me trade in the car for something even cheaper! I was even willing to come back to this place and take another chance. But they dont want to take a loss. This place os just sad and I do not recommend that anyone comes here. They even made us promises that they would take it back of we waited when it was "buying season" again. And they flat out just lied and said they couldn't off me anything. Unless I pay off what I owe and still have money for a down payment for another car. They messed up and sold me a lemon. And they cant even help me out. Now I'm stuck paying thousands of dollars just to keep this car running.<//text>< Gmap_id>

I purchased a BMW with this dealer. Before I came in, I already asked for the price of the car I want out the door over the phone, but I was surprised when I came in, they gave me a much higher price than what was quoted. I asked for a fair price, but ended up paying higher what was quoted to me. After I signed the contract, Said promised that my license plate should be in my mail a week after, which I think is impossible. I followed up after a month, and promised that I should get the license plate a week after and made an excuse that a third party is handling all the licensing to the DMV which I think is bs. After a week, I followed up again, and I was told that it takes 5-8 weeks to get the plate, when in fact they promised that it will be delivered to me after a week, and then made a promised one after the other. This is the worst car dealership I dealt with, and the worst after sales customer service ever.  A lot of inconsistencies and lies on how they run their business. Warning, please Stay away from this dealer.</Review>

<Review>Austro Motors is the dealership that made my life easy. Iman, Diego, and especially Anna went out there way to make sure i left the dealership beyond satisfied with my car. I have gone to many dealerships around the LA area and none before them has had the hospitality and customer service that they had. Austro Motors had excellent inventory of vehicles and comfortable environment. Couldn't have picked a better place to purchase my first car.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Ok I was happy with the place until a week later after I found out that the VW Passat I bought had hidden issues. First oil leaks was a big issue I took it back they fix it ok no problem then I found out the car had no heater or defrost, went back showed them and they basically said not our problem the car is yours deal with it. Now here comes the major issues more oil leaks from the top and side of the engine come to find out they had the wrong oil cap on the car fitted with some kind of goop they use to help seal it. Upon further investigation we found Bars Stop leak in the antifreeze which probably clogged up the heater core which answers the question why the car has no heat. Also fuel pump cracked open under the back seat they fixed it but charged me half price. Also they had my new plates from the DMV for over 60 days I had to go to the DMV to find out they had them WHO DOES THAT? This place was a big RIP OFF! Needless to say I will be taking the owner to court. If you buy there pay the extra to have someone check the car out from top to bottom bumper to bumper!!!! They will promise to fix all the issues the car has but once the cost add start adding up they will quickly stop.< /review>

I wanted to upgrade from my 04 Chevy Trailblazer, was referred to Austra Motors by my son.
I met with Iman, then Diego. I wanted an Audi, but came away with an awesome BMW X5. I was very reluctant when I found out that the engine needed work, but they fixed the issue. Iman, Diego, Anna and Fabian are all great people and each one helped make my car buying experience much better than I thought it would be. I love my BMW, and the rest of the fleet is fabulous! They have Jaguars, Porsches, Audis, Land Rovers, Escalades, Mercedes, what are you looking for? Check out Austra Motors!< /Review>

Terrible salesman!
They didn't treat me well. I am not comfortable with the customer service. Anyway, I will never suggest this car dealer to my friends.</Review>

Hi . Without a doubt, Austra is the best dealer ... if you are looking for a nice car and at a good price Austra is the place you are looking for ... I am very happy with the purchase of my Honda Civic ... they were very friendly and explained everything very well. And they helped me a lot as the first buyer ... they make you focus like in falilia thanks to all .. thanks Ana.

(Translated by Google) Last month we decided with my husband to change our family car and for a while we searched several places and due to our low credit score the answer was always negative even in places until they came to treat us rudely and complete unprofessional mentors; until fortunately we found This place and we know Mrs. Maria a very professional and kind person helped us a lot and despite our credit situation helped us with an aseptable interest and in many places of used cars there is doubt about the mechanical condition of the cars that sell in our case That is not how we arrived, we got the car to the Toyota dealer and it is in perfect condition, we are very satisfied and we certainly recommend this place thanks to read that God bless you and help you to get a good deal.

Loved it! Great staff. Porkbelly and brisket were exceptional. Tried all the sauces, liked the spicy and the mustard based ones best.
Ordered the Mac and cheese advertised as Applewood smoked, sadly it was not.</review>

Great to be able to sit outside in their COVID-friendly seating (tables in part of their parking lot). Nice that they let us eat there with our dog too. Service was friendly, food was good, especially enjoyed the brisket, ribs, baked beans, and vinegar slaw! Would skip the pulled chicken and cornbread next time as both were too dry to be enjoyable.<//text>

I travel the country.  I'm a food elitist.  Im orginally from the south... this is the best BBQ  I've eaten at since my childhood of homemade BBQ life... everything is delicious.  Rarely do I recommend a place. This is 5 stars and the staff is awesome too.

<text>I guess it's good smoked meat, but $60 for 2 people to have a casual picnic meal barely enough to fulfill you? The potato salad was waaaaay too sour or too much vinegar, who knows who cares. Decent food I just feel the price is definitely not worth the stars.  Sorry guys...<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I can't say if it's because we went like 30 minutes before they closed or if its always that bad, but dry burnt ends and cold, gluey mac & cheese with cornbread so dry I almost choked, no thanks. Will not be trying a second time.</Text>

The BBQ is amazing! Not only can you call in, walk in, but you can also order online. I highly recommend ordering the sooner the better because they are always very busy. The brisket melts in your mouth with the BBQ sauce and the cornbread still is warm when you pick up your food! The best part is the wait staff and how accommodating they are for everyone. Gloves, masks, and outdoor socially distanced seating is a win in my books!<//Text>< name>

< review>
Some of the best barbecue I’ve ever had, and I’ve eaten BBQ in Texas, North Carolina, Kansas City, and Atlanta. They put a unique twist on classic dishes (try the smoked cream cheese on whatever you get!) and have a variety of delicious sides. The staff was incredibly friendly, and I will definitely stop by whenever I pass through. I would post photos, but the food was gone before I thought to get out my camera.<//review>

<text>My friend and I placed an online order for takeout at around 6pm on a Friday. The service was appalling. We showed up at the indicated time (35 min after the order was placed) to find out the order had not been filled. So, we paid over $10 combined for online ordering for a service we didn't receive. Plus we prepaid around $20 in tips for the appalling service.
We not only had to wait for the food (might as well just walked in and ordered), but several items we ordered, including items at extra cost (mac'n cheese with bacon) were no longer available and had to be substituted for regular price items. The staff was not only not apologetic, but kept giving excuses and got upset at US for being upset at the situation. The meat was good, but it's hard to enjoy it with a bad taste in our mouths after being treated so shoddily.< /text><Name>Patricia Fierro Scagliotti</Name><gmap_id>0x54d155647f140149:0x4b61b75f55e5216a<//gmap_id>< user>

Most important, the food they serve is highly distinguished. I visited more than once and I was always pleased. The pay is fair.

<Time>1497755513588<//Time><rating>3< /rating><review>Nice, cozy environment with options to eat inside and out. Main entrees (burrito and sandwich) were both delicious, but the sandwich we ordered was missing cheese (until requested), lukewarm, and most likely the last of stock for the day. The creamy coleslaw...everything but creamy - tasting wholly of cabbage. There's room for such potential, but currently not worth the $10-$12 tag for products listed. Good for a BBQ fix, but not for a hearty meal option.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Our friend picked up our online order we placed the night before and drove it home to us. Apparently they were out of deviled eggs that we ordered the night before and didn't have any room in the smoker for the cheese so the homemade smoked Mac n cheese was nothing more than bland kraft mac n cheese. The smoked cream cheese for the Mac Daddy burrito was plain cream cheese. My husband wanted my pickled jalapeños I couldn't eat so I ordered them on the side but low and behold they were in my burrito making the entire burrito inedible for me. Plus we had to pay extra to place an online order. Won't be going back or ordering here again. You want good BBQ go to Shamus T Bones.<//Text><UserId.>117374714862274317853<//UserId.></record>

<Text>I've been here many times in person, but a recent order from them on DoorDash made me want to leave a review. To sum it up, I ordered a side that they didn't have in stock at the time. Because of this, they not only gave me extra of another side I ordered, but wrote a note to me explaining! That's the kind of service you get when you go with this hidden gem.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Not a bbq fan, but my husband was craving a pulled pork sandwich so gave it a shot. Most affordable bbq it was $20 for both our meals, nice friendly staff, meat was cooked perfectly. The owner seems to always be there working along with her employees which is nice to see. Even their mac & cheese was smoked which was so yummy! Definitely coming back to try something else! Had to write a review cause it was so good.</review>< pics>

Friendly service, fair prices, filling and good food. Meat had a wood smoked flavor, achieved by a commercial pellet smoker. Good local BBQ place. Only reason why I do not give it a five star review is because; it's no Arthur Bryant's, meaning not a legendary spot. Kansas city, the Carolinas, Texas, all have traditions. This place isn't authentic burn barrel barbecue.</review>

Brisket has literally no smoke flavor.  Burnt ends are good, but not great.  Not impressed, especially for the price and amount you get for the $$$.  Corn bread was dinky.  Comon seriously? how much are you really saving on that!  If you are going to scrimp on the meat, at least let your customers fill up on cheap corn meal!<//Review>

Excellent local BBQ with no fuss.  Prices are on the high side, but so is the quality.<//Text>

Very elegant and convenient place. They offer generous meals and for inexpensive prices. We enjoyed the meals a lot and the waiters were super amiable and chatty. Will definitely recommend this place.< /Text>

<Text>This place set the standard by which I compare all other BBQ restaurants. The food is flavorful and filling, the meats are always fresh, tender and juicy and all the sauces are made from scratch. No processed ingredients are used and the rubs and seasoning blends are crafted by hand. the slab bacon and pastrami are painstakingly brined and cured with brine that is also handmade from scratch. The meats are all hand-trimmed and smoked on-site with hardwood consisting of apple or mesquite. Attention to detail and quality in every aspect of the food here is the name of the game here and the results are absolutely worth it.<//Text>< user_name>

{'time': 1594659649945, 'text': 'Kiel, the orders that went out to DoorDash and other customers were ordered almost 45 minutes before you even came in.  We were backed up almost an hour on orders.  The food going out was not your food, but the food that was ordered before you came in.  If roles were reversed and you had ordered ahead, would you want us to give that food to someone that came in at the end of the night instead of to you when you ordered almost an hour before?  That would be wrong.  Sadly we oversold at the end of the night.  We thought we had enough food for all of the orders, but when it came down to fulfilling them, we found that we did not.

We ordered ribs for $24.00 for just ribs nothing came with it, really, I have never had ribs anywhere that didn't come with 2 sides especially for $24.00. We had to take the ribs home to finish cooking them. My wife had their shrimp and crab boil. The crab was dry and over cooked. She was not able to eat any of the crab. The rest was just ho-hum. What a waste of $76.00. We will never eat there again. We were hoping that someone would come and ask how our lunch was, but nobody came to see if we needed anything, very bad service.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Having no idea of portion sizes, being a larger man, I ordered and paid for the bigger sizes just to receive a child's size portion. Not only did my family not get our complete to go order, but some of the meals sides were wrong. Given they seemed short handed and corona virus may have had an impact but with the prices they should have more then enough staff and larger portions. If your on a road trip, double check your order before you get back on the road.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1594776082701, 'text': "Sorry we messed up your order Wide Open.  All of our cashier's can answer any questions you have about portions before you order. There's a 1/2# of meat on the XL Sandwiches and 11 oz's of meat on the Royale Burritos.  Hardly a child's size portion, which in BBQ is 4 oz's.  You can order meat by the Pound and customize anything to satisfy any appetite.  For example if you want a pound of meat on a bun with  extra sauce and coleslaw, we can make it happen, all you have to do is ask."}</Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Stopped in on Saturday evening for dinner. Had a great experience. Tried the ribs, pulled pork, and the brisket. Ribs were tasty with just right flavor and a little stickiness to the glaze, just right. Pulled pork celebrates the pork. You can add sauce to your taste but it comes straight off of the smoker with just the rub and the bark. I love that they have nothing to hide, I want to taste the pork shoulder before I sauce it and this was wonderful. And the brisket... Outstanding! Would I like a bit more bark, Yes. Do I prefer a bit more spice, Yes. But if I want to please just me then I should cook it myself. These guys are making fantastic Q way up on the NorCal coast and they can hang with anything I have had in CA. This is not EXACTLY central TX bbq but we're not in central TX.

The creamy slaw was really good and would be welcome at any church picnic. The poppers are fun with a little something extra in the cream cheese. Definitely worth trying a few. AND... the deviled eggs are worth the drive all by themselves. Now I'm not saying we snuck in a bottle of bourbon and paired it with the porkbelly topped eggs. But if we had, I bet it would have been Out Of This World! ( okay, We did. )

So why only 4 stars? Well, I try to take these notes pretty seriously and the food and service were 5 star all the way. The seating and decor are plain and a little cafeteria like. Very clean and I look forward to returning when they have made a ton of money and can put a few dollars into sprucing the place up. Please don't hold that against them. This is a great place that I look forward to again the next time I am this far north.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Ordered doordash from here. it was my first time ordering from here, so maybe it was a fluke, but i got a TINY portion. I don't eat a lot, but i'd still need a triple order in order to get full from this place. Opened up the delivery box and felt robbed. Will not order again.< /Review>

<resp>{'time': 1588210612707, 'text': "Chris, first off I'm very sorry to hear about your experience and thank you for your feedback.  All of our portions are weighed at 1/3# of meat, and based on all of our reviews and feedback, that is too much for some and not enough for others.  There is really no way for us to please everyone, and I'm sorry you are not. It is standard for the BBQ industry, however, and well over the standard protein portion for other types of cuisine.\n\nWe are introducing a new menu in the near future that will allow you to choose your portion size, and give you more control over the amount of food you want and expect, as well as the ability to customize your order in a very straightforward way.   I hope you will give us another shot in the future."}< /resp>< gmapID>

Pretty horrible experience. Got a burrito, smelled really weird, like dirty cleaning rags, didn't taste good,  meat was off, made me feel sick. I tried to eat it but only got about 1/3 done. Wasted good money</Review>

<text>I ordered the BBQ Burrito with chicken and potato salad.  The burrito was delicious. The salad was average but not bad.  I felt the size of the burrito was on the small side for $9.99 but overall a good lunch.  I got there around 11:45 on a Wednesday and it quickly developed a long line after that so get there early if you are in a hurry.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Don't know if this place is better during the day, but at 5:30pm they had entirely ran out of Mac n cheese even after we ordered it. What little they had left was almost solid and felt like it had been refrigerated at one point. The sandwiches were room temperature and the bacon was almost rock solid to the point it felt like we were chewing on rocks. Thought this place would be so much better, very disappointed.<//review>

They catered at our wedding, food was beyond delicious and did not break our wallets! Laura was easy to keep in contact with, and our food was delivered on time, glad we went with them even though that was our first time eating there food. Will definetly be eating here in the future!</Review>

The five stars are well deserved on there own but I also wanted to counteract the idiot who gave a one star rating because they don't have any vegetarian options. It's a barbecue restaurant! Asking them to have vegetarian options is like asking an Italian restaurant to serve sushi. If you're a vegetarian don't expect a barbecue restaurant to cater to you and then give them a low rating because they don't. Just get your food somewhere else.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Time>1514069461373</Time><Text>Not very good.  The mac and cheese was thick and flavorless, the meat tasted ok but was dry and chewy.  Their BBQ sauces didn't really help, too sweet, not much going on with it.  The spicy coleslaw was kind of like cabbage that had been tossed in Italian dressing then had a ton of vinegar added to it.  Maybe see if they'll let you taste a bit of it before you order it.  I certainly wouldn't have ordered it if I had tried it first.  I'm not one to leave things uneaten, but I couldn't stomach that slaw.<//Text><UserId.>112042223324557264690<//UserId.><resp>{'time': 1588890163120, 'text': 'Thanks'}< /resp><user_name>Ihte Gurgl<//user_name>< rating>

I read some reviews on that other site (which I won't name) and everyone raved about their BBQ.  I had their smoked ribs, nothing to write home about, the meat didn't have the slight chewiness that I like with my  pork ribs, but it also wasn't fall off the bone good either.  The BBQ sauce it came with was pretty generic.  They said the sauce was spicy but no hint of heat any where.  I also got the Jalapeno poppers which was half a grilled jalapeno stuff with cream cheese and topped with bacon bits.  One was had heat while the other wasn't spicy at all.  I also tried the deviled egg topped with pork belly, the egg lacked season and the pork belly wasn't enough to give it the pop.  The service here is good and friendly, don't come too late because they start running out of stuff.< /text>

Staff are friendly but we can never go here because there are no vegetarian options (I think there's a side you can get, like coleslaw).

I've gone here to pick up food for others and also have carried in food from another restaurant so I could eat with my friends.

It would be awesome if they started carrying a seitan option!< /Text>

I love the layout and design of the place. Plus, the staff are friendly. And, perhaps most importantly, the tacos and sides kicked butt (^^).<//Review>

Started off on the wrong foot. Lunch time on a monday, and there's TWO people on duty for work, NO URGENCY whatsoever. Out of pulled pork?! At a BBQ Spot?  Hope the food is better than the service!< /review>

<Text>I like the place for lunch, but I'm going for meat and I put sauce on it. If you want Mac and cheese or a big dinner meal then not fit you. The burritos are really good, probably my favorite. For me one star is a walk out can't eat.....2 is horrible service bland food....3 is ok for ok service... 4 is good for nice people....5 is awesome for awesome service  :)</Text>< Pics>

This place is delicious. Along with a selection of all your bbq favorites, you will find they have their own sauce, shirts nd hats as well. I stopped in with some friend's and we all had something different. Everyone agreed everything was on point. The meats were cooked to perfection with the right amount of tenderness and juices left in but still smoked and carmeled to that perfection that you love. I love how the places is dressed up to fit that smokehouse feel. They have alot of staff on hand to help and they all are friendly and polite. Stop in if your ever in town.</Text>

<Review>If you want to sit down and have an absolutely great bbq sandwich, a wrap, burrito or taco with great side dishes then come on down! Small town cafe feel . ummm ummm good! Go early for lunch. They sell out of certain menu items . not always the same items . Made myself hungry thinking about it</Review>< pictures>

Very disappointed. Ordered Mac and cheese bowl to wait 20 minutes before being told they did not have enough for my meal. Got offered a refund only to be shorted by a dollar. A waste of time. Will not be going again. Do not recommend.< /Text>

That pastrami jerkey though 😍 everything is excellent. Get a pork belly slider with whatever you're ordering, you're welcome in advance.</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>This place was down-right nasty. They had a problem with Insects These little gnat fly bug things kept buzzing around and trying to land on my food. And the food was horrible nasty under cooked and the little fly things kept trying to land on my food I couldn't take more than 2 bites before I got sick to my stomach had to spit my half chewed bite back on to my plate then by that point I gave up and decided to just let the d*** insects have the food.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x54d155647f140149:0x4b61b75f55e5216a< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Was really excited for bbq, and it smelled great inside. It was more expensive than i was comfortable with but thought it'd be worth it. Unfortunately my sandwich was pretty bland and mac n cheese was fairly tasteless as well. Disappointing.<//review>

i ate there once, it wasnt very good. gave them a second chance with their thick cut pastrami sando, terrible and cheap sandwich bread, poor presentation and portions. $16 for a sando soda and side. Avoid.< /review>

Food and service were outstanding. Some of the best tasting ramen ever. Portion size was incredible, so be prepared to take some home. Servers and hosting staff were very polite and very timely. If you are looking for great tasting Japanese food and great prices,  this place will do it.< /Text>

They have a decent menu and the best part is that they're open later than most places. I had the salmon poke bowl and the California roll and it satisfied my craving for sushi. I really recommend this place if you're looking for some quick sushi or a poke bowl!<//Text>

The tango mango drink was delicious. Never had a drink made with sake. Also had the salmon nigiri, salmon roll, and salmon sashimi. All of them delicious. My date had the teriyaki chicken also amazing.</text>

Busy place.  Rolls are good size and filling. Depending on what you order,  food can be flavorful or bland. I've had better sushi but this place is a good local spot.< /review>

<Review>I tried them on the spur of the moment me cause they had a drive thru.  I was taking a chance because we never eat Japanese food and I wasn't sure if my family would like it. They loved it! Didn't try the sushi only the other dishes.  Would definitely go there again. The food was very good!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Very impressed with a spot that tackles so much (sushi as well as poke burritos and ramen PLUS THEY GOT A DRIVE THRU Y'ALL) and yet maintains such high quality. The Energy and Sunset rolls are fire, and the appetizers are no slouches either. Another sushi spot to impress the homies with😎< /Text>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>The very best sushi spot in California! The ramen portion is large so make sure you have someone to share your delicious rolls with, which you should also definitely give a try! My favorite sushi rolls are the ones that have asparagus and cream cheese in them, so the Super Philly was the absolute highlight of my meal. The Kaiba Roll was very unique in flavor and well made as well. My boyfriend ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and while I usually prefer Miso Ramen, I ended up trading bowls with my boyfriend halfway through xD The Bluefin Carpaccio was also so great with the ponzu and mayo drizzled over.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>My 1st time visiting tonight and more in the future! Thank you Kaiba for being open late on a Sunday (till 1230am). Bought a Tempura Shrimp Crunch Roll and Sushi Burrito.... both were VERY delicious, great portion, good prices, and well packaged for drive thru service. The guy working drive thru was very friendly and welcoming. Posted 2 photos. Thank you Kaiba!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80dd29ee6b1b21fb:0xcbd9b51521099459< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>Customer service is beyond a 5 star rating, as well as their rolls! Everything was done in a timely manner we took about 30 min here from start to finish. First sushi restaurant I've ever seen with a drive thru, if you are craving sushi this is the place to go!< /review>< user_id>

Salmon burrito sushi...Wow! One of my and would recommend to anybody. Also, during the pandemic they’re taking incredible precautions. Plus they got a drive thru.</review>

<text>This is a great small little Japanese eatery. They replaced a sushi place we used to visit frequently and it to my wife and I too long to try it this place, but once we had dinner there, we went back the very next day for lunch; they're that good.

Their menu is a bit small, but everything on it, that we've tried, is good. The jalapeno bomb is probably the most average item on their menu, and it's very good. The crunchy asperagus roll is one of my wife's and mine's favorite roll of all time. If you haven't tried this place yet, do yourself a favor and stop by.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ4_L9hEpymp7mqlHRhdH-zEEVLvBoeWx8D6Yc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWbL-P3IUHJ9pDYzbEfV5KuicksMtL1nylI0RS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTbpwEA58sFG8irWRAuTWR8ePBko7K0ujDkCV0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5FuFY3tY8iGGcuJYHJ_lafpfOerCl8S3xz5nE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPelIYwa_fXPX084hrv6qH3OWysbwy-4hDFrgUW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I think this place is pretty good, but I’ve had better. I think it’s well worth to try and judge for yourselves 😋 the 1 thing I was frustrated about is how little they served my wife’s drink 🍹 I thought they would at least give her more alcohol since they served half the glass, but nope!<//review>

For main course, tonkatsu ramen, salmon burrito, tempura and sushi burger. Excellent! Everything's was wonderful. Note: the bun of the sushi burger was the crispy rice and the French fries were tempura sweet potatoes. So extra light & crispy-highly recommend!

We ordered a Tuna Sushi Burrito, Spicy Miso Ramen and Takoyaki.

Staff was very attentive and quick.

Tuna Sushi Burrito: Flavors and texture were on point. The rice was a thin layer but not too thin where it broke. The garlic chips and 2 sauces as a dip was a plus. We ordered a Super size and shared, still very large portion.

Spicy Miso Ramen: It was not very spicy, broth was good but nothing unique. The noodles were way too much, so much we barely got any broth. The noodles were also weird, not the right noodles used for Japanese ramen. They used Chinese egg noodles. They also give you only half a soft flavored egg. What a tease!

Takoyaki: Yummy! They had the right sauces and I love the Bonito flakes!<//Review>

Delicious ramen!!! Although I wish they had more ramen selections in their menu. The ambient was comfortable and the service was pleasant. Good variety of sushi, ramen, and appetizers. They even had sushi burritos!!!! It was all great. Highest recommendation!< /Text>

28.39 for this much drive thru sushi. They asked for tip... if the fish was somewhat not store market fish I would be inclined to give a higher rating and an actual tip, but what sets it apart from McDonalds or Burger King? Nothing</Review>

<review>Tonkotsu ramen and Takoyaki. Got everything to go. I liked that the noodles weren't hard and ready to serve. I liked the takoyaki as well and they give you a lot of sauce. But, I feel like the takoyaki is overpriced with only four balls.</review>< pics>

<text>Based on all the reviews I was excited to try this place out. Interesting menu choices from sushi, ramen, udon, salads, and burgers. We got the ramen, fried chicken, the free gyoza (via yelp checkin), and a caterpillar roll. The best thing was the roll. The ramen was ok, but seemed to be lacking something. The broth felt overly fatty. Fried chicken was also ok. And the gyoza was ugh.

Right in the middle of our meal all the lights turned off. I thought we had a blackout for a moment when all of a sudden one of the waiters starts shaking a tambourine. Then party lights started flashing and the wait staff sang happy birthday to one of the customers. Once it was over all the lights came back on. Never seen such a show at any ramen place before.

The building looks like it was an old Taco Bell. Complete with drive-through. The parking is ok but you have to watch out for the drive-through cars. No wifi is offered here. From the outside the place seems a bit shady.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBM76EmGBJEkJT_XlV4_tq_cwGrZ9kXx9VCRYG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGAWkgY_6s8WbA1q-NqLOwOtfZwPBAGRQnHe_G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSS_A69DY3U9e6jva5OCxdKqYg-Sh-9vUpB089=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqklPgfTRvIGvHUOceQ4R8cSzFP1Csm8oeZMYo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZmdYipNzGXPrMdxYlPrQ_Ozc0e0mHfNGTmPGE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX6vVa-7RRFG58H1dcJHHnIHqvFS0g9qP4zHXF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlQxc59xorkwb0GPzZoNVt9Cyn5JaDIia6cInw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<username>Adam<//username><text>I think this place is pretty good, but I’ve had better. I think it’s well worth to try and judge for yourselves 😋 the 1 thing I was frustrated about is how little they served my wife’s drink 🍹 I thought they would at least give her more alcohol since they served half the glass, but nope!</text>< gmap_id>

<review>Food was good but a bit pricey for what it is😔. The sushi isn’t the best I’ve had but it gets the job done. Not the worst but definitely not the best, bit disappointed since this place was very highly recommended to me by one of my friends.

<Rate>5</Rate><text>This is one of my favorite places! The food is amazing, and fully customizable. They genuinely care about food allergies etc and will bend over backwards to ensure a positive experience. The spicy miso is the best I've had, and paired with a mint lemonade and some sake, it makes for a great evening. Their COVID response has been great as well. The drive-thru makes it very convenient to order ahead and pick it up quickly.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The service was nice even though we got there close to closing, they didn't rush us. The food was good. And it was more then what we expected. The price of food was worth the quality and the amount. They didn't even say anything about us having a happy meal from somewhere else for our son.</text>

<text>Passed here so many times and never in my mind thi k this place look so nice inside. From The outside it looks kinda ghetto to be honest.
One of my friend recommended here and I was surprised. I gave it a shot and I'm hooked.
The service was really good. They will check on you regularly and know what are they doing.
The food was good and on point. We didn't have to wait for too long and food are fresh.
The decorations was cozy and doesn't have any chemical cleaning smell.<//text>< rate>

I always go to this restaurant and the service is usually great, but my dad told me he went today and he was disappointed because he says a guy who was taking the order from him was rude. When my dad was almost finished the guy rushed my dad and took his plate away and he wasn’t finished eating, he also brought the check very quickly as if he wanted my dad to pay right away and get the hell out of there quickly. I’m writing this review for my dad as his English is not very good and he doesn’t know how to use the phone very well to write a review.</text>

<text>Had a good experience here after a friend recommended it to me. I ordered the mild Tonkotsu ramen with extra noodles. The ramen itself was very delicious and with extra noodles was definitely full by the end of it. My only problem was that the broth was too salty for my taste. They have such an eclectic menu that I will definitely be returning however.< /text>< pics>

I always go to this restaurant and the service is usually great, but my dad told me he went today and he was disappointed because he says a guy who was taking the order from him was rude. When my dad was almost finished the guy rushed my dad and took his plate away and he wasn’t finished eating, he also brought the check very quickly as if he wanted my dad to pay right away and get the hell out of there quickly. I’m writing this review for my dad as his English is not very good and he doesn’t know how to use the phone very well to write a review.</Text>

Had a business dinner at this restaurant,  and very much needed to Express how Excellent service and the great atmosphere and most importantly, how food is just outstanding. 🙌 Love the Yelp option for a free item and is always an initiative to choose this place over others. Super plus for me personally. And also that was they offered to box our left overs themselves. Such a great, kind way to grab new customers loyalty, in my opinion. So simple to do and at the same time not part of their job so that was greatly appreciated. Must try! Highly recommended.</text>

Pretty good value, the staff were all pretty friendly.
We ordered a sushi boat, that came with teriyaki beef and chicken, California roll, and dynamite roll, assorted tempura, and gyoza.
If I was going to say anything negative, and this is just me being picky its that the batter could be lighter on the tempura, and the teriyaki sauce tasted differently then I was use to.
Other than that for around $40. it was a pretty good deal.
Give them a shot if you live close by. Would I drive out of my way to go back ?  Maybe ??< /review>

A good friend brought us to this restaurant, didnt seem like it from the outside, but good food, great service! Especially liked how fresh and succulent the tuna sashimi looked, tonkatsu ramen was flavoursome and definitely try the spicy seafood yakisoba!< /text>

Food was good except they forgot my ramen. Im giving a 2 because they didn't know how to handle the situation. My hand was raised for probably 1 min and they were just looking at me, I guess they were discussing which ramen I got. Cancelled my order because I was running late for my flight, but they brought it out as soon as I cancelled it. By this time I lost appetite.

They didn't offer to give it to me for free, didn't ask because I was just busy worrying about making it to my flight.</Review>

Hands down one of the best Japanese food I've had in this area for sure. I had the Kaiba  boat and Ramen. The only minor complaint are the young servers. They could be taught a little more manner and learn how to improve on their customer service a little bit more. Not that they were bad; they were actually decent but if they had some more experience this place would be the only place I would dine out at when in the area. Other than that, 5 stars!<//Text><Date>1522453002257< /Date><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

I knew this was highly rated. But its an old drive thru building. So wasnt expecting that much.

Sushi is fresh, prefect temperature, and boy the thick cuts. Didnt look that great but tasted really good.  And the sashimi combo comes with real wasabi (frozen), not the chemical paste we normally get. That was impressive.

Even the spicy miso ramen was superb. One of the best i have had.

Met everyones expectation. Great service. Superb sushi and ramen. And not expensive.

Ok rolls are a little on the chunky side. But good value for money.

Cannot ask for more. 5 guys, over ordered with beer for under $120!!< /review>

I have been coming to this location since it used to be named Maki Sushi. This newish restaurant has a diverse selection of Japanese food. Their Ramen is surprisingly ok, although not the best in the area. Their sushi selection is fresh tasting. And it's a huge plus that they operate a drive through!<//text>

<Text>Disappointing. Huge drop in quality on product and increase on prices. 5.95 for 5 pieces of gyoza? Ridiculous. I got the rainbow roll and it tasted room temperature with little flavor. Sad to see the quality go down since last I was there.< /Text>< date>

<text>I paid $16 for a roll I ended up not eating because they didnt tell me over the phone that the roll they suggested had cooked salmon. I'm all about raw salmon. It was super fatty roll. Couldnt get myself to eat it even though it was pricey af. Wouldn't come here again.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The GF and I have been faithful Kaiba customers for many years now, I'm surprised I haven't written a review before this point. The service is always friendly, the drinks are always cold and the sushi is always good. I love the large menu they have. From sushi & sashimi to Ramen and teriyaki there is something  for everyone!

Honorable mention to the brussel sprouts,  Monkey Brains, and sesame chicken.  The appetizers are all amazing and can be a meal by themselves if you like.

Did I mention the sushi burritos and burgers? How about the $1.99 Sake? Kaiba is the spot to eat, go there and find out why!<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>This is one of my favorite places to eat! A lot of people discount it because it has a drive through but that shouldn't stop you. The custom service here is excellent, your food order comes quickly, and it is always delicious. My go to items are the dragon roll and the tokantsu ramen. This place used to be a burger restaurant. Kaiba came in and used the Drive thru to its advantage. Even through the drive thur you get great service and great food. The o ly thing is just because you're going through drive thru don't expect fast food speed. It takes a bit longer than an average drive thru does but it's definitely worth the wait.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dd29ee6b1b21fb:0xcbd9b51521099459<//gmapID></record>

It has really nice service, very friendly, but when it comes to the "extras" they used to have like the free small samples of ice cream and the variety on the menu I think it was better before when it was named "maki sushi". Not sure if it is under new management but most likely that's what it probably is,  but I liked it better before. Food still good but did not impressed me, and price wise i feel it is slightly pricier than before.< /Review>

Sister and I came by for dinner. Food was delicious. I recommend the Unagi burger and Sake sangria. We will go back. Staff friendly. Prices good. And like them on Yelp for free CA roll , soda, or ice cream.</text>

This is my go-to sushi restaurant. I stick with three items, although there are plenty other options. My top three choices are 1) Jalapeno bomb, 2) Salmon Burrito (warning, the large stands up to its name, and if you want to eat something else, do yourself a favor and order a mini), and 3) Crunch Asparagus. I often pair my meal with their $2 draft Sapporo that is so cold there are ice chips floating at the top. Be sure to do a Yelp check-in for a free starter, drink (non acholic), or ice cream. The staff is friendly, and most often attentive, but they're working on hiring more people, so this should soon be remedied. Last fun fact, they have a drive thru. Yep, a sushi joint where you don't even need to leave your car to order.</review>

Awesome food! Sushi portions are big and they have a good selection of specialty rolls too! Amazing staff and menu design! I was scared that the replacement to my old drive thru sushi spot Mako would be unsatisfactory but it was quite the opposite. Dining in the restaurant is very nice even though it is on the smaller side, new, clean, and modern. This is now my #1 stop for all my sushi desires!<//text>

Their spicy miso ramen soup is delicious. Their drive-thru menu does not show everything they make. When you get to the drive-thru window ask for a paper menu because this place is worth going back . you can also enjoy indoor dining.< /Review>

<text>This used to be Maki Sushi that our family visited on a monthly base for over 10 years. The new owners have redecorated the interiors which look great. The menu has been re-vamped which is good, but we do miss the bento box meals. Although I like to support local small businesses, we may not be coming here as often as before.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

< review>
Have been going here for almost 10 years . Changed hands listen here ago and we recently went in there.  My wife and I for dinner and before dinner ordered one tall bottle of beer and asked for 2 glasses and he said that he would have to charge for the 2nd glass. I always do this to keep cold, then order 1 more sometimes 2 more,  I told him no way get the manager so he did and 3 other people came back and I told him this is never happened to me before and I'll be the last time.  He said he would wave at this time I said well you can wave good bye to me cuzz I will never  come back.<//review>

Really liked the new place. $0.99 beer special all the time, and the rolls are large but cut to a good bite size. I tried their ramen and it was very good. I have been here 3 times so far, once inside and twice I used their drive-thru. Everytime I have been happy. I just wish they had some sort of customer loyalty program in place.< /review>

Food is decent for sushi, it's not as good as sushi joint down the road, but for drive thru sushi you should have your expectations set accordingly.  The main issue is the service through the drive thru window, I have been here at least three times, and 2 out of those 3 times I waited at the window for about 20 minutes with nobody greeting me or charging me for my order. In fact most of the time I don't even think they know I'm here even though I just spoke to them through the speaker. Even more frustrating is at the window you can see the workers standing around chatting with each other.< /review>

So disappointed a few months back when all of a sudden this place was where Maki Sushi has been for years. It was THE best. Honestly this place is barely ok. Compared to Maki Sushi it sucks.</Text>

<review>Delicious! We came last week because we found out this place changed ownership. We are here again! Unlike the previous reviewer, I think this place is way better than Maki Sushi!! They serve a little of everything on the menu, but I particularly love their ramen! It's just Spicy Miso or Tonkotsu here, but they are both good. My husband loves their poke bowls. Their ice cream dessert is to die for. Overall, great new place. Expect us to come back again!</review>< pics>

Most successful restaurants don't just up and close down, so I don't know what that says about Maki Sushi. I was never able to try it. Kaiba though, is really good. Their prices for rolls and nigiri are very comparable to other local sushi places like local chain Orange Roll and Sushi and Kampai in Los Alamitos. The rolls are pretty substantial as are the pieces of fish you get when you order nigiri. The ramen and sushi burritos are also really good. I definitely feel like I get my money's worth when coming here and the food tastes delicious. Add in the great service I've received and this place is awesome. Love this place. Just my two cents.<//Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) In general, the food tasted good.
The salmon pork that I ate was great, but the sauce was a bit spicy and a bit sour.
The donkotsu ramen was also very delicious, and the sesame chicken and squid meat were delicious.
