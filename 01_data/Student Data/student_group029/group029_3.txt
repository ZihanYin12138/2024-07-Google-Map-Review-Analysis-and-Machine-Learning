Cute little shop tucked into a corner and wow this place is great for a cute date! Came with no wait on a Saturday night and this place has a really great wait staff who constantly checked in with me and even gave me a napkin when I spilled something and didn’t realize he noticed.

Standout dishes were the paratha for sure it was some of the most soft and flavorful paratha I’ve ever had and it goes great with the curry sauce.

The coconut chicken noodle soup was great too with the soft chewy noodles and yummy soup base. The moneybags weren’t as yummy  but we’re super chewy and unique.< /review>

So lovely and delicious 🥰
The host was absolutely adorable and the food was beautifully presented and so tasty.
🍴 we got the tea leaf salad, the coconut noodle soup, the chicken curry and a side of coconut rice (lots of food for just the two of us 😅)
Worth making your way to Noe valley for this spot if you don’t live around there 🙃</Text>

We came here on a Sunday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised. The food was great!! Fantastic flavors. We took only vegetarian food and were surprised how good it was!

Out of all the dishes, parotha with coconut curry was sweetish and didn’t appeal to our taste buds. Other than that, everything else was awesome!</text>

< Review>
Perfect dinner there with my daughters recently. The food and the drinks were great, so was the service. I would recommend the gyoza, the chicken kabob, garlic noodles, Thai tea and lychee tea.
Also the food is much less greasy than other oriental cuisines. Love it.</Review>

<review>Had this on my `Want to Go` list, I think someone had recommended it to me. I also see that it is highly rated here, so I can only assume my experience is a bit of an aberration. But the experience is what it is: got some Pork Curry for takeout, restaurant is nice and clean, staff was polite and super nice, but the curry itself was... well, not good. Bland, fatty, salty - not a good combo. Really a bummer, as I had high hopes...< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1622678108116, 'text': "Hi, Sorry to hear that our food didn't appetite your taste."}<//Response><GmapID>0x808f7fb188a10a2b:0xd5d3393ba86e0640<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Made me go back couple times already since stuffs are super nice. Latest SIP period ,  they do delivery and pickup. I picked up my desserts Togo.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk4bhEBBBuCZAcAsAN7Dy_iukyvHZqOn6oHp0g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMypEXN_xL1jUaO55aa3gaUajERWxUZnQvJB1WE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEE7wrpqcfyduazgxTLty_bM4wOQxl7uXy7wMV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKC33XlOMGjkMH4fNU6H2yDdV2PBtlXfhJCZhT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkHFgwQnnsPtj7XhrdkooCfZnSAZoTlkyOu6LC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO30ADeRxoa80VdVPHyMUcOH4q4FQKxkUC7zJX2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2nQqj370h2BbHEIqaH82MorU84WRvtabtTtM4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJqHUrBycRMFVlUgZgyld7YblWRV_pbgTjQfWC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRhKu-oLPFWklp2IxN6Sci0NZhF-Rx3Rl378wI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-hzkouQXt3KFadISXON6tT-NMQ7lanKDDchPP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Delicious new place in the neighborhood. Tasty food, especially the tea leaf salad and the golden bags. Friendly service and good take out during the crisis with outdoor pickup for extra safety. Update, still a local favorite but I'd now add the parata with coconut dip to the must try appetizers, it's wonderful.< /Review>

Outstanding food and very good prices. Large portions with flavors both rich and light (not easy with Asian curries). Delicious, good service and a nice atmosphere. The type of locally owned neighborhood place that deserves to be supported and does a great job. Loved it.<//Review>

The best Burmese I’ve ever had. The customer service is top notch as well. I got the chicken kabob meal and the gyoza’s along with the tea leaf salad. All of it was amazing and different than other restaurants. You have to try this place!</Review>

<Review>Great addition to Noe Valley! I had family in town last week and took a chance on this new Burmese restaurant. It was great. We ordered a lot of dishes and all were solid. Service was good and prices were amazing. Will definitely be back.

Update: been back a few more times. A few other reviews have said this but the tea leaf salad and golden bags appetizer are amazing.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Solid Burmese food, a great location and the staff is super nice and attentive. Plus, you don't have to wait 2.5 hrs to have tea leaf salad</Text>

<text>Best Asian fusion spot! My husband and I have been visiting this restaurant for a few years now. It is our go-to place if we are craving fusion Asian food, Drunken noodles, Coconut soup, fried rice, hot and sour soup, Vegetable curries, they got it! Their flavors are full, delicious! Their staff are always so efficient and friendly, welcoming. I always love coming to this place. Solid Chinese-Thai food spot.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Went in for a basic cleanup on my eyebrows, which was not even great with the after results and the one lady working by herself was not friendly or professional at all, didn’t even greet me or my friend as we walked in, had an attitude the whole time while doing my eyebrows, paid with my debit card and instead of giving it to my hand she placed it very hard on the counter with attitude. Do not spend your money here!! Rather spend my money at a business that acknowledges their customers and treats them better</Review>< pics>

Diana is by far the best of the best! I’m super picky and hesitant when it comes to my brows but with her I trust.  She takes her time, and super soft handed She will make them on point as the way you want it! So happy I found my eyebrow lady, thank you Diana for a flawless finish every time!</review>

Always there to get shaping and clean up for eyebrows. They are fast and precise which is difficult to find now and days. They always ensure customer satisfaction and I highly recommend them.< /Review>

It took me a while to find somebody that was great at threading eyebrows. A few months ago I went to the Hesperia Eye Brows R Us..and I found a person named Diana that does an AMAZING job. Everytime I go back, I make sure I can have my appointment with her. She is talented, professional, clean, and easy going. If you want your eyebrows a specific way..you can tell her and she gets it spot on. My mother goes to her as well. She's great. I hope people see this and go to her..I can guarantee you won't be disappointed.</Text>

<review>First timer. My brows were so bad after over 3 months of neglect (new mommy!!). Now my brows look great and I can finally trim my bangs. I will definitely be returning.<//review>< pictures>

Diana is the best! She made my eyebrows even. They've never been even until she fixed them. Not only are the ladies here friendly but they're good at what they do. I'll make the 20 minute drive to go here.<//Text>

I went yesterday to have my eyebrows threaded , I always go with Diana but she was not there and I took a chance to go with a younger lady who was there . I told her I wanted my eyebrows just cleaned up and not thin. She left my eyebrows so bad. One is thick and the other is thin and differently shaped. I have to regrow my eyebrows all over. I wouldn't go back to her and stick with Diana . She's amazing. Im very disappointed and embrassed with my eyebrows</Text>

Hi.98% of time I've had great eyebrows.  Been coming here for awhile and I only had one bad experience. I don't know young ladies name but my eyebrows were so uneven that I am now growing them out . I will still give 5 stars just because of 1 bad experience doesn't  affect me to give less  in any way cause I've Always have had great service. Wonderful group of ladies . I'm stoked cause they've grown out alot since I was there over month ago and I believe it can be fixed .
I like the 2 salons that I've been to.  On Hesperia rd and Palmdale rd
Thanks ladies making me feel pretty.<//review>

Great things.
I really like it, beside a rude staff.
There are lots of stuff in here.
To school stuff to kitchen supplies.
There are things You want and need.
It's really organize and clean. Lots of space!</Text>

Sometimes the cashiers are nowhere to be seen, so you just sort of stand there not knowing what to do. The store is ok though, they have what you need for a good price. The negative however overpower the positives as a store is most of the time messy a lot of things are not in stock and it has closed down twice over the past year because of rat infestations.</text>

A good chance for gas before you take on the windy, forrested drive to the coast. Not a road you want to be on at night with no fuel.</review>

There's not too much I can really say about a gas station I mean I put my credit card in type in my numbers and I get my gas. That's about it plain and simple. The cash register dude is pretty normal he isn't fantastic he is an amazing but he isn't the worst pretty normal pretty basic. Say good morning saying say good night depending on what time you're in there and you'll have a fine time<//Text>

< review>
The girls inside lied about someone already being in restroom and didn't give me the until I came back twice asking what was going on with the key.  Another customer familiar with the station told my husband who was at the pump that the girls working do that the time...not wanting people to use the restroom. If I could have done zero stars I would have! I was there at 1:50 pm on Saturday oct 22, in case anyone who cares about the crappy customer service being provided will be able to tell who it was!</review>

<text>I just got back from India, and this place is absolutely amazing!!! Their dosas (Indian burrito) are about 1.5 feet long (see pics) and are one of my favorite foods of all time - I always get the lamb, eggplant and sweet potato one, medium spicy. It comes with soup and coconut chutney, which is absolute perfection! Their chai is legit (enough heat and grit at the bottom from all the spices), and gulab jamun is soaked all the way through, YUM. I love the people who work here - Pradeep is so nice and helpful! Nice atmosphere, with natural light, beautiful Indian music and decor, and actual space between tables - yes!!! This place is my reward to myself after hot yoga. Thank you guys!!!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPKXjbL4R16rID4zTRc--Y_alK-n6YfrZJOz4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

Indian Burritos are my families favorite for a fast and easy meal. The service is above and beyond, even for a to-go order. And the attached Indian grocery store has a wide selection of yummy frozen items, as well as homemade Ghee. This place is a West End Village gem!</text>

<Review>Food was bland, they add too much red pepper on top if you order spicy. Boiled cauliflower pieces on top of the special pizza, meh. Had expected it grounded.
Pricey, if you compare it to the taste value. Service sucked. Some late comers got their food ahead of us.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The menu is mostly South Indian and Indian street food. As a South Indian I was disappointed with some of the dishes. However, the few North Indian items on the menu were really good (the parathas). Overall, decent food and way over-priced.< /Review>

<Text>The menu is full of great choices. For vegetarians, vegans, and gluten-free needs, they've got you covered, with most of the menu being vegetarian from the start, with well-marked vegan and gluten free items.

We started with one of the chaats, and it was a lovely way to start the meal. The fried potato cakes and seasoned chickpeas were tasty and not too heavy.

The eggplant dosa and palak paneer dosa were perfect. The eggplant (baigan bharta) was seasoned in a way I hadn't had before, full of cardamom and bright flavors of onion. The palak paneer had great and plentiful pieces of cheese, with a spinach sauce that was just the right balance between earthy and lively.

Our server was helpful and friendly, as well as the waiter that refilled our water. The grocery had many items that I'd like to come back and pick up.< /Text>< rate>

< Review>
I am strictly gluten free and love how this restaurant accommodates my dietary needs. They have separate fryers one gluten free. They offer many dishes that are vegan and gluten free. Everything I have had is good. I would like to say I like my food spicy...but I always order medium and NEVER HOT!!! Trust me on this one ;)

Favorites: Aloo Tikki Chaat & Spinach Dosa with Paneer

Thanks to the wonderful staff! Always great to see Pradeep and his sweet smile.</Review>

<text>This place has an awesome lunch special. $10 bunch for this platter that comes with paneer, lentils, yogurt, and more. It doesn't look like much, but once you're done eating you'll be full. I've also had their dosas. I love the flavor of the lamb spinach dosas, however I've seen restaurants that will serve you absolutely gigantic dosas in the city. Also Elvis is the absolute bomb. He's always very nice and loves to educate you on Southern Indian street food. If you want to try your hand at Indian cooking, there is also a market here for you to pick up whatever masala your heart desires.</text><resp>{'time': 1487294352326, 'text': 'Thank You Nick for giving us your ratings!

One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to, and I have eaten at perhaps 50 of them. Very pleasant atmosphere, informal, feels like home. My party enjoyed the service...Pradeep is a real jewel! But the food is to die for. We each ordered a dosa with different fillings and shared. Somehow the dishes manage to taste familiar and exotic at the same time, and everything was fresh and first rate. You have to try their chai, and you have to try their gulab jamun dessert, which they serve properly hot. You won't be disappointed!< /Text>

<Text>Firstly, the staff is so kind and attentive. Elvis is a sweetheart! I would come back just to chat with him, but the food is also so amazingly delicious. I ordered the paneer dosa. It is so good I can't order anything else even though I want to try a different one. I will be going back regularly and I can't recommend this place enough! Also, try the mango lassi and chai tea. Yummm!</Text>< Name>

First, Get the Dahi Puri! Second, this is a very nice place on the quiet stretch of 4th St. The outdoor tables are great on a warm evening. It's run by the people who run Vik's in Berkeley so you know it's good stuff.< /text>

This is such a cute place, we stop there for lunch every time we are in area. They have a patio out back with a little stream. Staff are so nice and friendly. Food is delicious, their oysters are from British Columbia and they are the best.</Review>

<date>1559410649804</date><Rating>3<//Rating><review>Sometimes the senior citizen swing dance club meets here. Sometimes Joe might be playing or singing. Sometimes feet are tapping to the rhythm of the live band. Powell's is the place to eat platters of oysters because why order half a dozen when the whole platter is a better deal? Of course, it's mandatory to have beer or wine to gulp down in the same movement that you gulp down the oysters. Crab sandwich really needed more  "oomph" to it- maybe lettuce or tomatoes or side garnish or toasting? Nothing worse than thinking that you too could have cut a piece of bread and dumped crab meat onto it with a side of Thousand Island.<//review>< Pics>

Yummy seafood and the best part is they are Dog friendly so you can sit outside on their back deck overlooking a creek with your doggy with you. Definitely recommend just slight caution if you have a toddler because the water might be tempting.< /review>

Sat on the backdoor patio. No lighting, sun went down and it was too dark to read the menu. Recieved clam chowder without any napkins. People kept smoking even though there are signs saying not to and my daughter started coughing. Complained to the waitress and she said we could move seats instead of confronting the smokers. We came in, where the bar crowd was sloshed and yelling, which would have been fun if I didn't have my kid with me. Have been waiting for combo Louise for FIFTY-FIVE MINUTES, it was just a salad with cold seafood dumped on top. Long wait, mediocre food, and not a family environment.</Review>

I was excited for a nice dinner and drinks with my husband and my father. We are making sure to support our local restaurants and businesses so Powells was on our list.
I'll start with the good! The bartender was their saving grace and he is the ONLY reason they get any stars at all! We were able to enjoy a cold beer because the bartender took and provided our drink order while we were on our way out back to our seats. Unfortunately, we did not eat. We were never even offered a menu! Our group of 3 was seated for more than 30 minutes and the waitress never even greeted us! Not only that, but she never offered water, drinks, a menu, much less a "hello"
Trying to make the best of a bad start we pulled the menu up online. We decided to make our selections so we could place an order when the opportunity presented itself. We assumed said opportunity wouldn't be too terribly far away because there was only 3 other seated groups (1 out front and 2 out back) so we should be acknowledged relatively quick. NOPE! Boy were we wrong! It was almost 40 minutes before we finally decided it was time to leave! We chose not to give up on our night so we walked across the street to another restaurant.
We enjoyed wonderful service, food, and drinks at Cascada!<//text>

<rate>4<//rate><review>I'm rating this place a 4 because of the wonderful people and the lovely back porch area with stream out back (ignoring the highway.

I'm from the islands in Maine, they tried and put their heart in it... but no.

These are not Steamers, the crab meat had been frozen and the accompanying chowder was a fail, but the shrimp was fairly good.

Please folks spend the money to order a delivery of chowders (a few different) and steamers from Maine... (Gernet Trading Co. Is a good source but not the only). You'll LOVE it.

Get the cookbook What's Cookin' Downeast in Maine.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x809a50b4f7b88c99:0x616bed3584dc0cdc<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Brought the whole family here for dinner..I was very disappointed because they only brought 2 dinners out at a time, with 20 mins in between each ...so we couldn't eat together,  we ate in shifts of 2..everyone was starving and had to watch others eat..food was just OK..Probably won't be going here again, unless its for drinks....<//Text>

Good seafood location. An unexpected find in a small location. Beers on tap and the college football games on tv. Definitely worth checking out.</Review>

Holy Batman the taste of the food! We bought $130 worth of entrees and appetizers for 8 people....The music was good though.</Review>

We had a great time listening to the music, Deb Smith and friends". Will definitely go again. Our first server was amazing but after she left...not so good.<//Review>

I thought clam chowder was supposed to have clams in it, mine had more celery than clams and too much flower in the sauce making it heavy and thick. The peel n eat shrimp haven't been cleaned!!! Do they expect you to de-vein the shrimp at the table?! The combo Louis had tiny shrimp like the ones you buy frozen in a bag for cheap and crab that turns to chalk in your mouth (just weird). 2 stars because the waitress was nice and she took the shrimp off the bill<//Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>We went there for dinner, the menu had some great looking options. And I am sure they are great. But we walked in and the music was so loud, we had to walk outside to discuss if we wanted to stay. We ended up eating somewhere else. 3 stars because the menu looked great. We did note that the place was mostly empty...

The restaurant next door had customers, good food, and we could talk. So go to Steamers since you have an option if the music's too loud.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x809a50b4f7b88c99:0x616bed3584dc0cdc<//gmap_id></record>

Stopped in for a quick drink, surprise to see full seafood restaurant.  I do NOT eat fish or any seafood However, husband ordered traditional clam chowder.   Server brought a small sample of their red chowder as well...I sampled and LOVED it! Sampled traditional and also LOVED it! Fun place, Chowder amazing!< /review>

Sheela and the whole crew at Powell's Steamers are amazing! Great beer/wine selection along with fresh seafood and classic dishes. I love the lazy man's cioppino and Hangtown chowder. Give them a try!< /review>

The food was delicious.  The service was good.  When we came I at 7 pm, the place was almost empty, which made us a bit nervous.  But we would go back again.  The only thing that would have made it a better experience is either no music or a different type of music.  Didn't find Grateful Dead very relaxing for dinner.</Text>

They have beer & wine and the price was reasonable.  oh yeah, we had oysters for our appetizer, yum yum< /Review>< Pics>

Great bartenders ...wish there was a better selection of wine at an beer and wine only place. They need a lighter wine, such as pinot noir, tempranillo, mourvedre, or syrah.
Food is fair, nothing to write home about. Atmosphere is good. Back porch needs heaters to enjoy the outdoor ambiance.</review>

<text>Great bartender! Daniel and Bonnie are amazing, lots of insight on beer and wine. Best cioppino! No shells and lots of bread.
Powell's has a patio, next to a creek where you can enjoy food or a smoke. Locals are friendly and create a "everybody knows your name" type of bar.
Must stop for fresh raw oysters or clam chowder!< /text>< pictures>

Nice cozy little pub. I've been there twice while in Placerville on motorcycle rides. I haven't tried the food but they have good beers on draft (805 and shock top for us) and they had live music today. The band (Random Strangers) was a little too country for us but they still sounded pretty good. We'll definitely stop there again on our next ride through P'ville.< /Review>

Food was good service was a bit off.  We did arrive just after the band was done playing so maybe that would explain the slower service.  Definitely worth trying again and the corkage charge was only $7.45!< /Text>

< Review>
Not good. The clam chowder was way too think and too few clams. The ciappino was a thick marinara rather than broth and had only a couple clams, some white fish and two sizes of shrimp. The shrimp scampi was served over "rice pilaf" that was swimming in butter that was heavily flavored with lemon and garlic. Not at all traditional or what you would expect for the price. Not impressed...<//Review>

When you make the chili so hot you can't taste the meat or other ingredients; it's not a good thing. I would of loved tasting the rest of my food and drink. Will not be coming back.

Ordered two asada tacos everything on it including red chilli on top and a coke.</Review>

Fresh meat, you can taste the difference. My parents have been going to Jimenez for a while. From Fresno mind you! The owners are so adorable< /Review>

<review>Jimenez meat is always fresh and never processed, you can tell by the carcass displayed when you walk in. The  color and flavor of the meat guarantee it.< /review>< rating>

<text>I was in the area and would have really liked to try this brewery, but couldn't find information on the beers they make in under 15 minutes. They had an 'under construction' note on their website (how many hours/days/weeks does it take to construct a list of text...?), which then said to check their social media (nice save!), which then had a broken link to their Facebook page. I gave up hope after digging through Instagram post descriptions for 10 minutes. Maybe the mystery is part of their brand and people enjoy not knowing what to expect. Or maybe they're so focused on beer quality to spend time on communicating the most basic information about themselves to potential customers--I'll never know--but I headed to Pariah instead.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Its such a cool place to have a drink in a dynamic yet relaxing atmosphere. It is super nice and pleasant to be there, it's cozy but everyone gets a spot where have a private conversation. Also, games are fun, and gives you free pretzels!! :D< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I’ve visited nearly all the breweries in this neighborhood and this one is not one of my favorites. The beer I drank was pretty good and the bartender was friendly and helpful. They lose a couple stars for cleanliness and an obvious urine smell at the end of the bar near the restroom. I still recommend giving the place a chance because I love small neighborhood brewpubs.</Text><GmapID>0x80d954fecf1d61ef:0x4d7d47de45a67d68< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Love this place
It's the punk rock alternative to that other punk rock establishment down the street... which makes it extremely more punk rock. Oh yeah, the beer is delicious too</Text>

I really like the vibe of this place. They've got a pool table, shuffle board, and darts so it's a great place to meet a group. Beer can be mediocre but some brews are really enjoyable.< /review>

Great, laid back spot to grab a beer. I was especially please to see an a la carte taster option to build your own flight. The selection of beers is long and spans a good range of beer styles. Service is friendly, and they have complimentary pretzels (always a bonus). Good specials offered throughout the week as well.<//Review>

The place was a little cluttered and dark for my likeing. Beers were sub-par, but than again im not one for drinking craft beer out of a mason jar. Shandy on the other had was pretty good.</text>

They serve their beer in mason jars (even their tasters) so they are hip as well.  They have specials of beer mixed/infused/hybrid with hard liquor (e.g., the panty dropper 18% alcohol content and served in a 2 ounce mason shot glass).  Interesting concept but in my opinion a little too wild and crazy strong.  But a good taster if you've never had any.  They keep to the IPA theme as do many San Diego breweries and they do well.  Not an IPA type person but here i was.  Their american strong ale and blonde were so-so.

A star for having a pool table ($1 per game), shuffle board, and darts.

Tip: Bring cash and your dog!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I have to agree with John. This is by far the worst brewery I've tried in town (I've tried over 50). Every beer I tried tasted infected.< /text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>The Allstate Insurance Company under the direction of Yumi Hyomoto Sam is fabulous.  The entire staff is professional,  knowledgeable, courteous and always very helpful.  There rates are terrific.  The more things you have insured the more you will save$$$.  There's not enough adjectives to explain how great this company is.  It's just a pleasure to deal with them and you can get insurance for almost anything that should be insured. Don't hesitate to call them, you won't regret it, and also find it a very pleasant experience, with peace of mind.
I have been a customer of Yumi's for many years and never once regretted it.  Thanks for everything Yumi. Ben< /review>< Rating>

Long waits for buses and poor service. They need to improve more better routes and buses to come on time. I don't feel comfortable to trust it. Also, staff need to improve better accountability. More passive but then aggressive vibe.< /Text>

< Review>
OCTA Bus driver Stephanie, African-American female with short hair.
Route 46
Bus 2322

Racist, rude, and hates her job.  OCTA owes me an apology and this lady should be fired and should reconsider her career.  If the situation was switched, and a white bus driver told a black man to "get the hell of the bus" and to "pay another fare"... all hell would break loose and we would see "Black Lives Matter" protests.  It's simple, if you do not have passion for your job FIND ANOTHER ONE.</Review>

Monday February 15th 2021 at 5:04am the 43 bus at harbor Blvd and garden grove Blvd heading towards Fullerton intentionally left me . I had a co worker on the bus at the time and he told the bus driver someone is trying to get on the bus and he looked in the side view mirror after not only hearing me bang on the window but after a passenger told him and he still drove off . I will be following up with a complaint not only to his field supervisor but also his field supervisors supervisor and corporate upper management until he faces disciplinary action.< /review>

It's cheap oh, it's not that much slower than cars, and the little extra leg work will probably do you good. Bring a bike or scooter if you need to. And there have a mobile app now that is great for scheduling and buying tickets ahead of time. Ride the bus<//text><GmapID>0x80dcd92e75a77f2d:0x45b4e301a6b2034b< /GmapID><Rating>5<//Rating>< Time>

<Text>OCTA is the place to go when you need help with Orange County's public transportation.  Also known as the Orange County Transportation Authority.
I give five stars because of the nice staff this place has. When you are facing the front of this building the actual OCTA store is to the left.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

This is the worst public transit system I’ve ever used. A bus that runs once an hour down Pacific Coast Highway does not provide a transportation alternative, It’s damn near useless. Your rates are the most expensive in Southern California and you are the least reliable in terms of frequency and timing. It’s clear your primary focus is keeping Californians locked in their cars using a soon-to-be for-profit highway system.
You’re the worst!< /Text>

<text>I'm not the type to leave a review but Ive had several bad experiences with bus 167 going towards Irvine I just had to. Two of the Bus drivers are really rude on top of that one speeds a lot and the other one just drives horrible doesn't know how to brake or turn smoothly I was getting on once I had barely paid walked like two steps when he steps on the gas then breaks quickly good thing I caught myself, this is the same guy that when I asked a question about the bus pass price and how it was gonna change he answered absolutely rude giving me a dirty look. I've also had to wait at the bus stop for about an hour cause the driver was running late. The woman just drives too fast and swerves a lot that's when i pulled the cord down cause my stop was coming up instead of stopping she started speeding up and drove right past my stop  moral of my rant please get better drivers !</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< review>
I ride the bus often and is my way of transportation. They do not notify people of bus stops being canceled during construction for route 53 south . It was to last minute changes once I was at the stop. Wasn't enough time to get to the other stop. It was very last minute since it was 10:44 and  the bus arrives at 10:51 at Collins and main. He recommended me to walk to orange wood.

E-ticket is acting up. Application isn't working I was trying to board the bus and it did not allow me to click on the ticket.

I was told by the bus driver my E pass was expired just because the app wasnt correctly today Feb 23 2017. He told me my pass wasn't good but the pass was still good until March</review>

I received notices and letters from OTCA and their attorney saying I violated the tollway by not paying. I called and OTCA told me they had a picture of the offense and it was not my vehicle and some of the license plate was blocked. OTCA filled in the blanks and guessed what the license plate and somehow came up with me as the offender. I live 1300 miles away from Orange County. I have never been there are neither has my car. I hope someone is looking out for the elderly and other vulnerable people because OTCA is profiting off taking advantage of people by sending out random violations to people. Shame on you OTCA.</Text></record>

Both times I have gotten off at Orange County the bus drivers driving you don't even know where they're routes are, when I asked the driver of the 54 for the 7:15 pickup he literally shut the door on my face your drivers are rude disrespectful and have no clue. Thanks to his lack of social skills I am layer for work. I'm calling to place a formal complaint and I want him written up.</text>

<Text>If you are in Auburn and the In-n-Out line is too long, go about 3 blocks south to this place.  In an old Dairy Queen.  The burgers are very good.  They have the correct ratio of bun to toppings to meat.  The onion rings were very good. Had a chocolate milkshake which did not disappoint.  (Their straws were extra wide to handle the thickness. ) If you have the time to get out of your vehicle, you will not be disappointed.<//Text>< Pics>

Got home to finally eat and there was a giant long curly hair coming out of it. I called and they refunded my burger but now I have nothing to eat and am afraid this place is serving pube burgers.

This place is legit. From the incredible pastrami burger this is true perfect amount of juicy to thier myriad shakes, malts and ice cream based concoctions...this is hands down the best casual food on Auburn. The staff here are super chill, very accommodating and the atmosphere is super laid back.<//Text>

Generally good food, though expensive. Shakes are a little too sweet, but still very tasty. The place is way too busy and the three window system is a mess when everyone is standing around outside. Staff is noticeably cramped and rushed.< /text>

< review>
The food is great, the ice creme is on point and the service is good. Not much else you can ask for. Their Onion Rings are the best in town and that western bacon burger is awesome! I have been here at least a couple dozen times and have only had maybe one or two orders that got messed up. They are usually slammed busy all the time so expect a wait if you're ordering food but if you just order ice creme then it's usually pretty fast even if they are busy.<//review>

<user>107134651578789279491< /user><text>If you are driving near here and are only a little hungry. Get off the freeway and treat yourself. A long time ago, it was a Foster's Freeze. The family that owned it didn't want to lower the quality in accordance with Foster's supplier requirements. So, they parted ways with Foster's and everyone in the community benefitted. The banana shake and the onion rings (the best I have ever had) are not to be missed.</text>< GmapID>

<Review>The best burger 🍔 this side of the Sierra mountain! French fries are always made fresh and crispy.  Any hamburger you choose will be delicious.  Fresh off the grill, and made with real meat, no fillers! Fresh lettuce,  tomatoes,  and onions. My mouth is watering just writing about them. Their soft serve ice-cream is also delicious. Wide variety to choose from! I highly recommend you stop by and sink your teeth into a 5 star hamburger 🍔</Review></record>

Called in our order ahead of time, our hot food was waiting for us and they made the ice cream right away. The food was all delicious. We had a western burger and the double d, as well as the "halvsie" half fries half onion rings. We also had a strawberry milkshake and a small cone. Very enjoyable!</Text>

Staff was unorganized and confused. No one knew what the other was doing. Our order took forever and was incorrect when delivered. Good thing I kept the receipt because the staff acted as if they didn’t know what I ordered. I had to provide the receipt to prove that they had missed items. Not worth the time. They should be happy cause we won’t be back.</Text>

<review>For years this place was a fosters freeze. As a lifelong Fosters Freeze lover, I frequented this location often. One day I pulled up to find that my beloved Fosters was gone 😭 I decided to give them a try anyway. To my delight, it was pretty much the same exact menu! I was stoked to say the least. I ordered my usual and made my way back to Penn Valley. A few days later I noticed that they had a second location in Grass Valley! I assume that they dropped the Fosters name so that they could save the franchise fee and open the second location without the additional expense. Great idea in my mind. Anyhow, the food is fantastic and theres always a line. Also, the best place to be on a hot summer day for one of their dipped cones 😋< /review><Resp>{'time': 1612854122678, 'text': 'Thank you for being a lifelong customer! 🖤'}</Resp>< Pics>

The food was a bit expensive. I paid $25. I got a burger, onion rings, and a raspberry shake. The raspberry shake was gross. I felt nauseous and almost threw up. The burger and onion rings were good. The chicken was undercooked. I added some bacon to the burger. The server was nice because I asked for a substitution of pastrami to put grilled chicken instead and they did not charge me extra for it.</text>

Have always loved this place and changing the name didnt change the quality which is amazing! We love making the drive up to Auburn to get a milkshake, every single flavor is delicious!! I love the thick straws they use so you can actually drink your shake! We recently tried their food and it was a hit too! We had burgers and a half n half which is half fries half onion rings. What a great idea for when you just can't decide on one!</Review>

The food here is delicious and the food is on point. Plenty of outdoor seating and two bathrooms available. I had the DD with a bigger patty and two slices of cheese and bacon and it was super juicy without being too too oily. The onion rings were well fried as well. I would definitely come back to try out the ice cream soft serve! Just a note: half the people weren’t wearing masks to order/pick up their order. Hard to enforce but definitely something to note< /Review>

Anytime I’m in Auburn I always try to make it by this place! The Hamburger’s and Shakes are awesome! My favorite shake it the Fresh Banana but friends who’ve traveled with me also enjoy their shakes as well! You won’t be disappointed I guarantee!< /Text>

Always great food and shakes. The burgers, fries, onion rings, and shakes are the best. Expect to wait for your order because they are popular and always busy.<//Review>

They are so thick that they serve them with extra wide straws that make it possible to suck it up! I haven't had the chance to order any food items yet, but if they are as good as the shakes it must be excellent.<//Review>< Time>

<Review>Fantastic "Twisties" if that's your thing. I've only been introduced to them in the last few years, but what a great job this crew makes of that simple concept called "Reese's" good soft serve ice cream and the peanut butter and chocolate pieces--nearly too many if such a thing exists.

Go enjoy...<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Loved the burgers, fries and onion rings.  Great flavor and not your tiny burger. Fries and onion rings delicious. Chocolate milkshakes; good size and flavor.  Their small soft serve cones are like a large in other places and their large is for 2 with a good appetite. Plenty of outside seating, they disinfect frequently and have hand sanitizer available inside. Overall food was great experience was okay, would definitely go back.</text>

When you order a burger you know your going to be stuffed, also at the same time you order the burger you can get your ice cream right away or they can give it to you after you eat your food. It helps alot not having to worry about your ice cream or your shake melting before you get to it. All in all a great place to take your friends, family, anyone even a date. I wouldnt call it fancy but it sure is good.< /text>

We get the old-fashioned or BBQ (great quality meat) with Tillamook cheddar cheese... yummy.  Today we tried the  cheese curds.  It's like fried mozzarella with cheddar cheese and a hint of garlic seasoning.  Amazing!< /review>

Food is good price is high and portions are ok. Sort of slow getting foods cooked but not always bad.
Glad the burgers are a little pink the way I like it.

Staff is super nice.

Adding
I hope your food is cooked to order that is a given.
Staff is usually running around trying to keep up.

But 1 young man was super rude making me repeat louder and louder when I did a doordash pickup.

So for the rest of the week I avoided due to how he treated me. The others had 0 issues hearing me. Nor did people eating 30 feet away.

I love coming here but he ruined my experience.

My minus 2 stars is due to some of the prices & avg times.

Part of the issue is the layout for cooking. They have a small tight area.

No business really deserves 5 stars.
I generally ignore 5 star ratings. As nothing is perfect in life.</Review>

Really good! The pepperjack on the burger gives it a little kick for spice. Criss cut waffle fries were great not greasy at all. I got the ghirardelli chocolate banana milk shake. Outdoor seating and outdoor bathrooms really great spot!</text>

<Text>Came here today with a friend. He wanted to try it.

Its a very busy place for sure.  Not a whole lot of parking...it used to be the old Fosters freeze.

They have windows to order outside or you can walk inside and order...its so much cooler in there.

We both ordered the western burger and shared a large fries.

Omg the burger was so good. The bun was soft and fresh...so good. The burger patty tasted flamed broiled...seasoned well...i liked the bbq sauce...plus the onion rings and bacon. The burger was so big...

The fries...awesome...fresh...hot...crispy on outside and soft on the inside...great lunch. I would certainly come back.

They also sell ice cream cones...shakes...malts...floats...
twisties which is like a blizzards...chocolate dipped cones...sundaes..chicken sandwich...ect...

I definitely recommend this place...😄😄😄</Text>< Pictures>

<text>The burgers, fries and shakes are very good here. Especially the shakes. There's a lot of customization to the ice cream and other cream items you can get.

However, the woman who took our order seemed very rushed and they requested a group to order inside even though they had no masks on and the restaurant had a sign requiring masks. I worry about public safety and their disregard for their own rules.</text>< pics>

Been coming here for over two years. Great local spot with good food and selection. Only problem is the attention to detail in orders. It has become more frequent that I order and get home to find they forgot ranch, fries or part of my order. So gotta do my due diligence and check my order before taking it out from now on.< /Review>

<Review>I remember when this place was Foster Freeze. Burger & Cream has friendly and helpful service. Great selection all around and the price point is not too high. I got a reg fry and a peanut butter and hot fudge sundae. Yummy. Last time I had a chicken sandwich and that was very good too. My daughter had a cheese burger and of course that was amazing too.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

This place is sooooooooo good. Tons of choices, including a small burger, The Junior, that's perfect if you're watching your portions (not what I ordered today lol but what I usually get). GREAT staff that works hard and pays attention. It's pricer than a fast food joint but you get a TON of food and won't be hungry in an hour. You can tell the quality is really top notch, I absolutely love the buns and the meat is always cooked perfect. I had delicious juice from these two patties all over myself today, totally worth it. Also extra points for the burger assembly - you can tell the staff really takes care to make a great product that eats well and doesn't fall apart. Keep it up B&C!< /Text>

I was very impressed with this establishment. The power in Auburn had been out for two days. As soon as they had power, B&C opened and welcomed all of Auburn. They were slamming busy and kept a cheerful demeanor. The staff didn't show any sign of being overwhelmed. The burgers looked delicious. I opt for the cream (milkshakes) during this visit, which tasted fresh and fabulous. IG: SACRAMENTOHONEY</review>

<Text>Been by here a couple of times and each time I have got something different and have not been disappointed. Decided to try The Guido which is a 1/3lb burger with 4oz of pastrami. Your getting between 8 and 9 oz of meat on this thing! Plenty of beef flavor combined with the grilled onions, house sauce, mustard, pickles, and lettuce (took the tomato off) gave the burger a really good flavor profile.

The waffle fries are spot on and should be the gold standard of what other restaurants should strive for when doing waffle fries!

With so many options on the menu I'll definitely be back!<//Text>< Pictures>

Very tasty! I was always a Foster Freeze fan but this was a change that benefits everyone. Owners have more leeway to purchase the quality products they want to serve their patrons and the consumer gets a better product resulting in a delicious traditional meal locally. Win Win<//Review>

< Review>
It was great food, a little pricey but I didn't like the fact that they charge an automatic tip fee of $5.45.
Edit: the owner text me back and said that they don't charge an automatic tip. They ask you if you want to leave a tip, and apparently my wife said yes. That's where the extra 20% came from. I apologize, and I'm making the correction now. OSH :-)<//Review>

We came here for dinner and were terribly disappointed. The customer service was awful. Lilly who took our order obviously couldn’t hear what we were ordering and after we got our order which was completely messed up, we had to order more drinks because she did not put them on the first order. She the proceeded to basically throw them at us because we were annoyed. She then began speaking rudely about us before we were even out the door. We will never be back to this establishment!</review>

<Review>DON'T ORDER ONLINE!
Shakes charge for candy at .70 cents. Sauces and fruit the first two are free. NOT ONLINE!!! YOU WILL PAY $10 for a milkshake with 2 flavors. They have a bunch of kids working as "managers" who tried to tell me the first flavor is "vanilla" for the icecream in the shake.? Okay what about the +70 for banana and the +70 for marshmallow? Then they put peanuts in? Waiting in the heat for 30 MINUTES FOR AN ONLINE ORDER. When I got my banana marshmallow shake is was plain vanilla... Why did I pre-tip 10%?????? Never again.<//Review>< Time>

If you're going to get a burger, fries, and milkshake in Auburn then this is the place to do it.  Small eating space inside, and outside tables as well.  Their burgers are delicious and on point.  $7-$10 for a burger.  No combo meals to help cut down on cost.  Classic window pick up service.  They are often very busy so don't expect to be in and out.< /text>

DON'T ORDER ONLINE!
Shakes charge for candy at .70 cents. Sauces and fruit the first two are free. NOT ONLINE!!! YOU WILL PAY $10 for a milkshake with 2 flavors. They have a bunch of kids working as "managers" who tried to tell me the first flavor is "vanilla" for the icecream in the shake.? Okay what about the +70 for banana and the +70 for marshmallow? Then they put peanuts in? Waiting in the heat for 30 MINUTES FOR AN ONLINE ORDER. When I got my banana marshmallow shake is was plain vanilla... Why did I pre-tip 10%?????? Never again.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>We came here for dinner and were terribly disappointed. The customer service was awful. Lilly who took our order obviously couldn’t hear what we were ordering and after we got our order which was completely messed up, we had to order more drinks because she did not put them on the first order. She the proceeded to basically throw them at us because we were annoyed. She then began speaking rudely about us before we were even out the door. We will never be back to this establishment!</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Grew up going to this “Foster’s Freeze” and it’s even better since becoming “Burger and Cream”. I have to admit- the name bothers the heck out of me, but they have the best onion rings ever. Their Crispy Bird sandwich is amazing and still have awesome burgers. We ordered the chili cheese fries last night and they were otherworldly. So good. If you want some old fashioned burgers and comfort food- this is where it’s at.<//Review>

Great food, good options on the menu as far as quick and yummy (burgers and some sandwiches). Not just your traditional milkshake/malt menu, lots of options that are very customizable. Prices aren't too bad.< /review>

Evidently Burgers and Cream doesn't understand food allergies, so check your food when you get it.I was very specific on the phone.
I  called to complain and was told I could drive back to town for another one.  Not going to wait another half hour for a hamburger.</Text>

Best burger stand hands down.... We love their hamburgers onion rings and tacos. Their milkshakes and malts are pretty awesome too.  My wife and I try and make a trip up from Sacramento as often as we can. Wish they had a place closer but we don't mind the drive. It's like a treat after a long week to get out of Sacramento on a food adventure.<//text>

Absolutely fantastic burgers. Built well, with all the best of toppings. Thick cheese, yet not overcooked, and when you bite into the burger all the different flavors come together for the perfect taste, and there just enough juiciness on the face to make it all together a great burger experience...!  The krinkle fries are hot and tasty also, helping to round out the whole experience.

Don't forget a most terrific chocolate shake to go with your feast....  the very best shakes around...!!<//review>

I know that eating a cheeseburger and having a milkshake is not good for you (especially at my age) but it didn't stop me. And I don't regret it. It was really good. You won't be disappointed.<//text>

Finally! A place that understands that a burger patty in not supposed to paper thin! Thick and juicy, cooked right, not over salted. The chili cheese fries were a very nice surprise. It's real chili, no beans, and pairs great with the wrinkly fries and cheddar cheese. I will be back as often as I can manage it.<//text>

Excellent quality and fast service. The western burger I got was good, but very greasy. The chili fries were also very good but greasy. Overall I recommend it. And the strawberry shake was great. Good texture and flavor. Definitely recommend it.<//Text>

It's a good very rare part of America a independently owned Burger Shack in a mini mall parking lot used to be hundreds of them now you couldn't find one if you drove around for a week good burgers used to be a Fosters but they got tired of Fosters telling him what to do so they got away from it and it's just fine<//text>

Stopped here on our drive home. Loved it. Hot day outside and it felt nice in the small dining area. Crowded but we managed to find a seat. Delicious burger and they customized it to my liking. Every item ordered was devoured and the kids and myself loved the desert!! $1.50 cones on Tuesday< /Review>

<Text>Great stuff for whole family. It may sound nasty, but a burger covered with chocolate ice cream is fantastic! Don't forget the nuts. You'll love it! They have other stuff too. Chocolate French fries, garlic toast with peanut butter! Even Elvis favorite, bacon with dill pickles! Enjoy!!</Text>< Pictures>

Anytime im in Auburn i stop here for a chocolate shake made with vanilla ice cream. You may ask yourself why vanilla ice cream??? Well chocolate ice cream tastes different from a chocolate syrup and theirs is wonderful! Try it....this might just be the way you order your chocolate shakes from now on.<//Text>

Burgers and creme is often hit or miss for dinner time. It can be really good for lunch or dessert but more than half of the time its not very good during business rush. They can also be stingy with onion rings. Service is okay and sometimes better than okay.</text>

Burgers and cream aka Foster Freeze has always had a place in my heart. I can't always count on them for the best soft serve icecream this side of the Mississippi. I hope their business lives longer than I do because I don't know what I would do without it.</Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Next time you're passing through Auburn, forgo the long lines at In n Out, drive a few blocks farther, and get a superior burger. This place is legit. Great waffle fries, super fresh ingredients, amazing flavor. Try the Guido Burger for something a little different. They were happy to put it in a lettuce wrap for me. And the waffle fries are real nice too. The Junior was the perfect size for my kid (8 yrs). Definitely coming back here next time we're passing through.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1523821979094, 'text': 'Such a nice and thorough review!

All were delicious and we highly reccomend to anyone in town looking for a tasty burger (they also have gluten free buns) and creamy ice cream.</Review>< name>

Best Bacon Cheeseburger I've had in years. All the ingredients were top quality and tasted fresh. Their service was very fast and friendly. I also love their selection of real Malts. I recommend the Vanilla Malt. (I've recently been disappointed by other local burger joints like "Big-A Burgers" in Grass Valley, CA, which have increased their prices and decreased their quality, switched to cheap processed ingredients, tasteless buns, etc.)  Burger & Cream is the best burger joint around for miles. Well worth the trip if you miss those classic style American burgers made with love!<//Review>

<Review>Ok so we we're looking for another burger joint and we came across this place. They were super busy . After we ate their we know why. The burgers were awesome. Fast service and friendly staff. I have this placed saved to go back too. It hard to find a place that really cares about the quality of their product. Definitely a place to go back to.< /Review>< user_id>

Great burgers, staple of the town. Good idea to stop by after a lake day. Not overpriced either</Text>

This place has been a staple of mine since it was still Foster's Freeze, and it's honestly even better now that it's a standalone place. I usually go solely for the ice cream, but the food is great too.< /Text>

I didn't expect the burgers to come out so good.  We were on the way to Lone Buffalo Vineyard, when we decided to stop by for some food off the 49.  It was a pleasant surprise.  The burgers are not old fashioned, boring sandwiches with just meat in them.  Burger cream truly crafted some awesome modern burgers, and the employees are very nice.  Hope more places pop up like Burger Cream in Sacramento.< /Review>

Great food and staff.  One star off (that is arguable) for the tightness of the parking...to be fair there is plenty around the shopping center.  The actual lot is cramped when any big trucks get in there but dont sweat the lot and come in for some great food and ice cream from the counter or walk up window.< /Review>

Love what they have done with the place!  Very clean and nice upgraded furniture. My husband and I both got the Double D burger.....very good. He loved his banana shake with real banana in it and my chocolate shake was yummy too.<//Review>

<Review>If I could give it more than 5 stars i would!! The absolute best burgers in this area. I even order the burger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun (though their buns are the best) and they have the perfect lettuce for that. Real high quality beef and ingredients.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The food and customer service are excellent.  The only downer is the tip opportunity comes before they serve the food.  Really unique menu for the area and nicely done.< /Review>

<Text>Tasty, cheap food. Appreciate the calories listed on menu. Great place for after a hike to score a delicious cheat meal! Always had good service, too. Only complaint maybe is that it's not the greatest ambiance - it's a cramped restaurant with little flair. But for a simple treat or casual hangout, it has my love.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

This place gives you the feeling of an old time drive in.  There is a walk up window and inside dining.  Their soft serve ice cream is incredibly delicious.  My son does not like cones and they will do dipped ice cream in a cup.  It's family owned and that makes the service stellar.  It's a great place to take the kids for lunch and/or for a treat after a soccer or football or baseball or lacrosse game.</review>

<Response>None</Response><text>Forget in and out, if you're in auburn, this is the burger joint to go to.  How good is it?  So good that foster freeze (it used to be one) told them they would cut them loose if they didn't decrease their quality because people would get unrealistic expectations for all their other franchises! Well, theyre independent now and as good as ever.  The burgers are cooked just right and at the perfect thickness. Despite the fast food exterior, the burgers come at more of a sit down pace but they are well worth it.  Additionally, they have that classic soft serve ice cream that really hits the spot when your sweet tooth is acting up and they have some of the best, crispiest crinkle fries I've ever had.  What really stands out though is the BUNS!   A lot of lesser  places make good burgers but spoil it with lousy buns but burger and cream uses local, top quality buns from a local bakery that do the burger justice. This is a huge plus.  Can't wait to try another!<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Burger & Cream was Foster's Freeze. It still has the same owner's with same great service. Food is even better because they aren't restricted by the franchise. Great old time atmosphere.

Definitely a step up from what it used to be great food but prices are a little high in my opinion for a hotdog kind of ridiculous but they are good so I keep going back even though since the prices so high kind of pushes me away $30 for me and two friends to have hot dogs and drinks</Text>

The best old fashioned burger on the planet! In and out is across the street from this location, and Foster's gets far more buisness. Thank you Lori for establishing such a great place that is consistent every time you go! May your soul rest in major peace knowing your family is still carrying your legacy!! I drive from Sacramento just for the quality and Supreme taste in the food!< /review>

We were sure people had been paid to write such great reviews for the newly named Burger and Cream; clearly after experiencing them post Foster's, we were wrong. Their burgers are FAR superior to any I've ever had at a Foster's Freeze - probably thanks to the Truckee Sourdough Co. bread, fresh high quality produce, meats and cheeses. They still carry crinkle cut fries - a huge plus for me as I always counted on Foster's having them.  Customer service has greatly improved as well.
One thing I will say can be improved is the vanilla soft serve. What they have now is still decent, but it doesn't have the crave-ability that the vanilla soft serve had previously.

{Burger and Cream} is definitely worth a try!  Give them a go and see if you agree.</Review>

This is an family favorite of our family. We spent almost every forth of July with foster freeze being our first stop before fire works.
The food is awesome and served fast. It's always busy, but they have a system that seems to work for them. The only down side is seating. The seating area is always packed. Last time we stopped by, it was raining out and the roof was leaking over a few tables. So they were blocked off. They did not have many tables as is... But it works to just grab your food and go. Love this place.<//text>

I am sorry I didn't come here sooner. Top freaking tier burgers, fries, and shakes. I judged this book by it's cover for years and was immediately proven wrong. Try the western burger with bacon and BBQ sauce. Try the onion rings. Just try this place.< /text>

<rating>3< /rating><review>Ice cream has gone down in flavor since they dropped the failing franchise of Foster Freeze. Got a response from the owner.
Maybe it was the artificial ingredients so many fast foods use. Will take a second look at the new taste. So many Foster Freezes are closing and NO new ones to be seen.Looks like they are on their way out. May be too greedy to franchise owners, as is the case with most franchises.< /review>< Pictures>

Well I was really not looking forward to eating there especially after the name change,  idk it just evokes bad thoughts the name at least within my social circles sounded lame . HOWEVER AFTER EATING THERE, DESPITE DUMB NAME , FOOD WAS GREAT!!!! Whew... Good job new owners, welcome to the neighborhood, just realize we love the grub but you will forever be teased about the name!! Great employees who seem to share the consensus that it's a great place to work!<//Text>

This place is a must go whenever in Auburn. Sometimes I just take the ride from Sacramento anyway. The food is that good and the milkshakes are ridiculous!<//Review>

Waited 20 minutes for my burgers and some cheese curds. When they finally came out there were 5 little curds and 1 small onion ring on there burger. Not worth the price or the wait.<//Text>

Best place in Auburn for a great milkshake. They have old fashion cones, Sunday's, and more.  Burgers are good but try the chicken ones or a taco (aaahh so good)  corn dogs too!  Will be leaving the Foster Freeze franchise and getting a new name soon. Mainly to keep all the great food they now sell.  Franchise wanted only their food.  Idiots.< /Review>

Found this place by accident while passing through the area and stopped for lunch. Steady stream of people seemed to be regulars. There is some inside seating, but we (like many other customers) ordered at the window and ate outside. Limited outdoor seating, but the turnover was relatively quick. Outdoor-access bathrooms were well-maintained. Great burger (fresh, tender, well-proportioned [not all bread]) and exceptional desserts, including a Chocolatey Peanut Butter Banana Twist that knocked my socks off. I guess the place used to be a Foster's Freeze franchise, but they parted ways with the parent company in order to better serve their customers, and it's remained a family-owned and operated business for several decades. I'll definitely go out of my way to eat there again.< /Review>

After some off roading in Foresthill, we decided to stop by on our way back to Sac. Grabbed the pound burger and it was AMAZING. They didn't ask whether I wanted the patty well done, medium or rare and made it medium. PERFECT for my preferences! A little too fatty but when you order a 1-pound burger you don't usually think about that stuff lol. Ask for cheese if you want it, the 1-pounder doesn't come with it.<//Text>

The old Foster's Freeze is a great place to go eat lots of food at diverse menu lots of ice cream and I don't think you can beat it and I think it'd be safe to eat there everyday except you might get a little heavy</text>

This was the foster freeze the owner left the chain and opened his own! He didn't want to cut the quality  of the meet and foster freeze said they had to all be the same as the other foster freezes, so let's support a local family who cares about the quality of his food he serves!</review>

The Place is fine it is like every other Fosters Freeze..
The only thing I can think of about this place .... once I went there it was closed because they ran out of ice cream at 3 in the afternoon.... I've never had that happen in any other Foster Freeze before</review>

Great food & Amazing real ice cream desserts- don't leave without at least trying one if their Ice Cream Cones ( Vanilla & Chocolate, Swril) or pick any of the Candy, Cookie, Real Fruit & Chocolate,Carmel (Ghirardelli!) Hot Fudge! Or choose more toppings from the extensive selection on the "Twistie" Menu & have it 'twisted up for a wonderful Ice cream creation !</Text>

So I thought it wouldnt be ok to stop by and get a vegetarian burger and I understand them giving me the burger had I not asked questions, but I specifically asked if there's was any dairy products, and  the associate told me "I don't know probable not" so I take her word for it and I was greeted by cheese in the burger along with thousand Island dressing caked on. I threw the burger away and aparantly the money I spent too. Needless to say, if you have an allergy, or even a preference don't come here, they don't ask and don't care<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>This used to be Fosters Freeze. It still is EXACTLY  the same. Only the name has changed. It says on the front door that they had to change the name or serve the same food Fosters Freeze used to...I would have preferred the 2nd option. The original Fosters Freezes were SO good, big portions. This was and is just "meh" Not super impressive, small portions and over-priced. I don't think I'll go back, except maybe for an ice cream...but even then, Tango is better.</text>< Pics>

I must say we will NEVER go back and will never stop telling everyone we know of how un-organized, un focused, and un-friendly, customer service operation that I have ever been to in my 50 years of life. Really seemed like racially motivated bad service as I am Mexican american and my wife is African American. We were pretty shocked that in this day and age of 2016, that this type of hateful behavior still exists in our world today when going into a customer driven establishment.
