They were extremely fast and efficient and got my part in no time . The owner identified faulty pieces crafted to “fit” my car. He was incredibly nice and gave me a really great deal . He even went as far as contacting the seller who sold me the car to credit back cash I’d be out for a mishap that wasn’t my fault . The people here are extremely genuine.

DO NOT GO HERE!! They charged me 200$ just to CHECK my windows and give me false information about my car and said it would be 1,000 to get my WINDOWS fixed. The owner yelled at me and threaten to kick me out because I was upset that my car had more damage than I came with. I went to a different repair shop and they didn’t charge me to check my windows. The owner is very unprofessional and MONEY HUNGRY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANY ONE TO GO HERE!!!</review>

< Review>
I brought my buddies Lexus in because it was not running well because I had crossed 2 hoses when I was doing the tune up. I take that back it had stopped running. At 1st it wasn't running correctly and then it stopped running I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. Turned out to be a huge bill he cut me a break on the price because at the time which is now I am going through a divorce and he understood how much stress I was going through. My family was collapsing and I had just ruined my friends car that I could not afford to fix. I highly recommend you come to this guy he will take carry properly.</Review>

I stopped in at 4:45pm on a Friday, asked if it was too late to get an oil change and to my great surprise they said “not too late!” The service was friendly and informative and my truck was done super fast!
I will be back!
Thanks guys!!

<review>I'm glad I read the reviews before going here. The business arguing with customers online is gross. Saying, "God Bless", after being super unprofessional doesn't erase all the second grade spelling errors or salvage the company reputation. Not everyone makes enough money to just throw around and hope for the best from mechanics who look messy and who seem to bring drama to the table.< /review><rate>1<//rate>< username>

< Review>
On Sunday June 23, 2019, I was traveling from San Diego to Klamath Falls (committed obligation in Klamath by 8pm) when I experienced a potential brake and bearing failure on my car trailer; I found A tech was open and arrived at ATech at 11:30 AM. The owner/ manager greeted me and I explained my dilemma. His shop was packed with one mechanic and jobs ahead of me. He performed the work himself with utmost care and found a loose brake, no parts necessary.

I owned a tire shop in San Diego for 28 years with ample experience to know good honest service and I received it! I currently am an expert witness and prepare reports for "Standard of Care" for Tire Stores. ATech performed, inspected and provided friendly service. Thank you , I also made my deadline in Klamath.

Stay Away from this tire Shop!!! They do horrible work!! Last year in July we took them our Dodge Charger to put on our Rims and remove the original stock rims, well first they lost the sensor in the tire, ( we had to pay extra for them replace something they lost) then we noticed 2 days later they did not return us our rim lock key for our tires, I called the owner up and he tried to blame us, saying maybe you forgot he gave it back to us! Then he finally said you know what bring it in I will proved you with a new lock, he had us sign a receipt  that we where receiving new locks for our tires, we left our car. I went to work, my husband went to pick up the car later that day. A day later I asked my husband how did it go he stated to me that the lock they handled him was a used lock and was not new like he showed us! We left it like that, (asumming it would work) we needed to do some work on a tire, we took it to another tire shop come to find out that lock did not even belong to the locks he supposedly replaced new!!! FYI (They also damaged all rim tires to break the locks off!! I did not want to make a big issue about everything, we just said we are NEVER going back there again)I called the owner up again he tried to deny saying he did not “remember anything” like always!! He then said bring back in the car, we did not because my husband works in the bay and we both work! Now we where in a car accident and the auto body shop needs to remove 1 rim to replace new and that lock does not work, I called the owner up letting him know it was us that had the issue back with the rim and yes we did not take the car back in but that he could please provide us with a some lock Keyes to try to remove the lock. He then said he “ does not remember “ like always!! He said we need to pay for another set of locks, I told him why do we have to pay for something your son did, he failed to return our rim lock Keyes to begin with!! Do your selves a favor and stay away!! His favorite line is “I forgot and I’m not going to argue with you” and finds extra charges someway!! And his son does not know what he is doing!!! Stay Away from this place.... And No you did not give us our Key back for rims!!! Stop lying 🤥 always making excuses up for all your wrong doing!!!< /Text>

Went to change my tires. Did not have lug nut. They told me they had all the keys. When they started working on my truck they told I had to get new lug nets because they stripped the lug nuts because they lied about having them. Then they could take the tires off the rim or put them on. Waited all day for them to tell me they couldn't do it. The owner then tells me my truck wheels are cheap and complains which is not truth they are premium tires, it was an excuse because they did not know what they were doing. I left it there till the next day. They gave me a call 45 mins after opening to tell me it was down. Why couldn't they have done it before in that allotted time. Bad service and liars< /text>

Took our Toyota in because our motor was shaking. We knew it was the evapp sensor since we have a mechanic in the family.. but my husband was working and I needed to take it in somewhere close by ASAP so I don’t lose the vehicle I take my daughter to school in.  Seemed nice at first.. but they convinced me to get a $350 tune up instead of actually fixing the problem.. told us to come back later that week and pay another 170 for the evapp sensor. As soon as we drove off the lot, it was obvious the car had the same problem as we took it in..
Anyways, 2 weeks go by and we finally take our car back in so it can be finally fixed.. and we get a call saying it’s a completely different problem and it’s pretty much toast. So they didn’t want to work on it.
Another week goes by ( we already bought a new car) and the mechanic in our family finally looks at it again.. and come to find out all we had to do was pay $50 and get new spark plugs.
Moral of this story.. if you wanna get ripped off, go here.</review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Don't go here!!! I have never wrote a bad review on any business. About a month ago I went here to get a oil change and brakes done. About $300 later, when I went to work the next morning I see my radiator cap where my wipers lay, ok whatever they forgot, no big deal. Then they did not reset my oil sensor. Brakes still squeaking. I go back and first of all let me say that the guy is sleeping so I startled him. So I begin by saying you guys forgot to reset my sensor and he says that's not our fault the customer is supposed to tell us they want that done! First of all I'm 42 and NEVER have I had to tell any shop but even then why be so rude and not just take care of it.  Then he says its that all you want? I said please check my brakes again as they are still making noise. He then rudely says it will be awhile as his guy is out to lunch?! How about suggesting an appointment or something. I walked out saying you know what nevermind. He then says what's your problem? I said sorry to disturb your nap. I have never had such poor customer service! What a shame.... Maybe I should have told him I'm in the delivery business which means lots of cars to be serviced.... Your loss< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

My husband has a GMC Sierra, best price for the off road tires they put on his truck. I drive a Lexus GX 470 and take my car there for all my oil changes since they don't overcharge for high mileage synthetic like most other places. Kind staff and we're loyal customers. Appreciate the small family owned businesses in our area, be patient and remember that you are not their only customer.< /review>

Seriously the most honest repair shop around.
I asked for a tune up, and they fixed a vacuum leak, that was the only issue, saved me $320 that's honest.

Horrible business!! I dropped my wife’s car off, got a qoute, agreed to that and sent my wife to pick it up the next day once fixed. He tried charging her more than what was quoted and he even tried keeping my wife’s keys from her if she didn’t pay his new price. They went back and fourth and he brought out a female to argue and become aggressive with her because “he can’t hit a girl”

$420 dollars later, a bunch of scams, and my car still has the same problem. What a waste of time and money. You will pay someone else to fix my car sir.

BBB and everyone we know will be notified smh!</Text>

DON’T ever take your car here!!! I trusted this place and all they did was rip me off more than once!!! I filed a complaint to the better business beauro because I got tired of them not doing the work they promised. The fact that they were rude because I had to keep brining my car back to them was insulting!! I took my car for a antifreeze leak!! 600 dollars later still leaking took it back another 200$ and yep you guessed it STILL leaking!! Took it to get the transmission fluid leak fixed and they made it worse paid 275 for that plus another 250 for a different mechanic to fix it and A-1 even had never to put old fluid in the transmission. I finally had to take it to another mechanic because the anti freeze leak was so bad!! That took 175$ and guess what NO more leaks!! To top it all off the leak they “fixed” was covered in silicon. So all that money I paid was for nothing!! Than the owner calls to ask why I reported him and saying he was always nice and leanient with me and blah blah blah, no dude you were stealing and lying! I’m a really nice person and I feel like they took advantage because I am a women! If you want to save yourself money and a headache don’t take your car here!!! Best of wishes.< /Review>

<Review>DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE.

Worst customer service experience in my life. Not to mention a terrible job done with no quality control or apparent expertise in autobody work.

Not sure how this place is still in business, given the terrible work they do, but do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere. My Geico adjuster said that this was the worst work and most unprofessional  autobody he'd ever dealt with.

I brought my car here for a max of 4 weeks of work after hitting a deer. They had my car for 8-9 weeks and never once called to update me on its status. I always had to call them once every week or two to figure out what the heck was going on. They never pick up the phone, so you have to call 4 or 5 times to get someone. Then when they finally pick up, they tell you to call back in 20 minutes, thus starting the process of never picking up the phone over again. Besides that here is what is happened when my car was finally returned to me:
- The car was towed to my house and didn't even start. They forgot to replace the battery that had a giant crack in it...Geico already paid them to install a battery and make my car work (obviously) --- so I was promised by A-tech that they would pay me back if I bought and installed the battery myself, I never received reimbursement for the battery...
- After they promised me my car for weeks, a tow truck delivery date was finally set for a Saturday, the car never came after I waited around all day, and then it randomly came that Monday with no notice or call. Atech's communication is non-existent.
- Atech returned the car with oil all over the front passenger seat. I paid detailers to clean this off, was again promised reimbursement by Atech, but never received any money.
- Atech returned the car with a crack in one of the side mirrors
- Atech promised to cover the cost of my rental car, but I never received any compensation.
- Once I got the car back, I had to take it to a detailer to buff the "awful paint job" on the hood (the detailers words, not mine). There are still paint bubbles on the hood that the detailer could not buff out.
- When Atech painted the hood, they also clogged the holes on the window washing sprayers (why wouldn't they tape those off???).
- I never received a receipt, bill, warranty or any paperwork from Atech when the work was completed...
- The car alarm wouldn't stop going off once I installed the car battery because Atech did not install a hood latch switch on the underside of the hood. I had to 1) figure out the cause and then 2) go buy and install this missing piece myself.
- Also the car was returned to me with absolutely no gas in it...<//Review>< Pictures>

Pricey. I showed up to drop off a car via tow truck and they were closed. Hours of operation are until 6pm and I showed up at 530 to a closed door. Charged me $150 for a part that cost 40$ and hit me with a labor charge of $300 for a ten minute fix.<//review>

<username>Vcdss<//username><review>This is the best automotive shop in Modesto I would like to compliment the staff and  maneger for their great Service  I have been dealing with problems with my car with shops that don't know what they're doing. In other shops I spent 1300 dollars trying to fix my check engine light I gave up on any automotive repair after  spending so much  . money my neighbor gave me the number to a tech auto and told me to speak with niel. The next morning I called niel he told me to bring in my car and all paper work from the other shops I took it with in an hour of calling him he told me to leave it for about four hours and charge me 85 dollars for diagnosis . After an hour and half of me leaving it there.niel calls me and tells me my car was repaired and ready.I could not believe my ears when he told me that.so I went to pick up the car he showed me the problem .it was a broken wire next to my power steering shaft every time I turn it would touch that wire I could  not believe that niel and staff fixed my problem for 85 dollars no parts needed the best part was honesty. Thank you thank you to niel and his crew now I finnale found the Best repair shop around it I could give you more than five stars I would give you ten from your new friend and customer Rick god bless thank you< /review>< pictures>

Worst shop ever bought a tire from them and had it put on at a different shop.. tire was leaking air from the sidewall seam went back to the shop and they took over 20 mins to come into the office to talk to me when I came back he son came in 3 times and didn't say a word to me tell the 4th time he came in he already knew who I was since I had called before going back since I live in another town he said there's nothing they can do.. I drove over an hr to come back and he couldn't even tell me that over the phone really after I just lost the money on that tire plus time and lots of gas. The worst shop ever!!!!!!!!!<//Text>

A friend and i brought his car here to check out the battery and put it on the tester. Ended up costing him $200 when he initially thought it was gonna be $60. $140 for a battery. Really. I'd find somewhere else.< /review>

<Date>1616186532514< /Date><rating>2<//rating><Review>I purchased a vehicle at this place and the vehicle had many issues. Unfortunately, it was a bad purchase from the beginning and I needed to buy a car.
I gave $5,000.00 down and my credit is outstanding. Make sure you read all the document well, check the car during day light, and have a person who knows about cars with you, and do not believe any promises. If it’s not in writing do not believe their friendly demeanor. Once you sign the contract and pay for the car, they don’t know you.Otherwise, you will regret it as I do now.
When, I first purchased the car, I noticed the windshield wipers were worn down, and I brought it back to the dealer. They replaced them with a low quality ones, and I had to purchase new ones.
The windshield glass had a small crack, but it was covered by the sale’s sign. After I took the car for a car wash and they removed the glue left behind by the sign, I saw the small crack. I let them know, and they said I had to get that fixed, which I did, at a cost of $128.00.
The car is used, but the cost I paid for it is not worth the car’s condition plus the extra things I had to pay out of pocket. I could have purchased a new car instead.
I didn’t want to place a bad review as it is not my style. But, I think that other people should be careful before they make a purchase. One of their employees warned me, but I liked the car and didn’t see all these issues coming. I should have listed to the honest man.</Review>< pictures>

I financed my first vehicle here last week, a 2015 Ford F-150 XLT Super Crew 4X4. I was worried that with no previous finance history of purchasing a vehicle, that I wouldn’t be approved. I met with the salesman Daniel Galvan and he has been amazing since day 1! He was able to get me an approval from their lenders with a monthly payment within my budget.

The truck was missing a tailgate panel, upon purchase Daniel said he would get one ordered for me. Sure enough, 2 days later Daniel called to tell me the tailgate panel arrived and I can bring my truck back any day to have their technician install it.

I am extremely satisfied with the level of customer service and professionalism provided by Daniel. Anyone looking to finance a vehicle, I absolutely recommended talking to Daniel Galvan at Auto Retail Group!<//Text>

I had signed for and made an agreement to pick up a car I had bought from them. Went to call them to set up a time for me to pick it up only to be told they sold it to another person. They just threw their hands up and said "oh well sorry". Incredibly misleading and dishonest experience.<//review>

In 2017, I was searching on CarGurus for a Buick Lacrosse with low mileage. I was e-mailed pictures and directed to ARG. Carlos (sales person) came out with the keys and let me test drive the car. Within about 2 hours I had a 2013, fully loaded Buick Lacrosse. I drove it to Sacramento, CA in 2018. I had no problems with it and the ride was smooth. Here it is, 2020, and the car still look and rides new. I most diffenately, give ARG a 5 🌟 review.

Thank you!< /review>

I had an excellent experience at Auto Retail Group. Came in to look at a 2013 Chevy Silverado. Fell in love. Ismael helped me with the purchase and his manager Felipe Gamboa assisted with some questions on the optional warranty. Came away with a payment I can afford and a warranty for the next 4 years/48000 miles. Overall, very happy with my experience!

UPDATE: I just wanted to provide an update on my experience. I want to be as fair as possible. To be fair, I did have an excellent interaction with the staff when coming to purchase the vehicle. It was following the purchase that I experienced what I would say are excessive hiccups. Now granted, I will take fault for a few of the issues. I was a woman alone buying my first truck so did not know what to look for. Got the truck home and had my brother in law check the truck out. He noticed the hub cap covers/locks were missing, making it easy for the rims to be stolen. This is my fault for not noticing. He also pointed out there was no spare tire. Again, my fault for not noticing. In addition, when you get the truck up to 60/70, which you cannot in the area where the dealer is located, it starts to shake very badly. All three of these issues I brought to the dealer within one week of purchasing. They responded a week later saying they will check for the caps and spare and to bring it in for the shaking. I said great, let me know what day works best. No response. Have a week or two for response, followed up. Stop no response about 3-4 weeks later.

Aside from those issues, here I am a month into my purchase and my brakes start making this TERRIBLE grinding noise. Take to mechanic. $500 to fix brakes and rotors because the pads were so worn.

Lastly, I am beginning to hear some pretty bad whining noise, which in my experience, is the power steering pump.

All this to say, remember... you are buying a used vehicle. Some dealers have standards for their vehicles and some do not. In my opinion, for this many things to be wrong right off the bat, the standards are low. Again, I will take some of the blame for not knowing about the caps/locks and not checking for the spare.

P.S. Very troubling about the spare since tires are pretty much on their last leg which I did notice and accept.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Awful. They sell cars that don't work or have major repair issues. It will be months before you even get your car. The manager and owner will promise you the world so you will buy and once you do all those promises go out the window. Save yourself the headache and your money and buy somewhere else.<//Review>< pics>

<name>Leo Angeles<//name><Time>1558137706543<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Excellent group of people to work with even though I did not leave the lot in a car.  From initial contact with Yanira, it has been a great pleasure working with her.  I have challenged credit and she worked tirelessly to obtain me an approval.  It was obtained. The whole team fulfilled their end of the bargain which was an approval.  The ball is now in my court in coming up with the agreed upon down payment which is a lot less than I expected. This is the reason when I have money in pocket, I will give them my business which should be in about 3 weeks. I was treated as a future customer and not judged due to past credit flaws.  They do not have a large lot but the vehicles I looked at were of good quality.  If you have challenged credit, make this a go to place. They will work with you.  Just remember this is a business.  As a customer, the best that can be done is to keep them in business by way of making good on car loans they extend to us with credit challenges.< /review>< pictures>

I felt comfortable since the very first call. Nianna was very professional & eager to work with me. She listened. She kindly explained. She followed up & got me exactly what I wanted all in a day!!
This team, even went the extra mile & picked me up in Long Beach! On a Friday!

I am forever grateful & their inventory/pricing has a great variety that is attractive & up to date, popular vehicles, its amazing!

Thank you Felipe, Nianna & ARG!</Text>

I just bought my 2012 mini cooper from ARG and it was the best car buying experience I could have asked for! This was by far and away the smoothest and least stressful transaction I have ever been involved in. I was given an excellent deal over the phone which remain the same even after I arrived. There was no high-pressure or attempts to trade me up or add on things I didn't need. Danny was incredibly professional, sincere, and kind. Would recommend this place to everyone!</review>

<text>I came into purchase a car and the customer service was great. Very welcoming staff. Felt like they really wanted to give me a car I wanted or would like with my budget.

I appreciated me giving them my budget and in the end it staying in the budget and not going over or way under for a car I didn't want.

I've had my car for 4 months now and I love it and would totally recommend anyone to check out cars from this dealership</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>I went to auto retail group in Rialto California and I wasn't really on the market to make a purchase that day  actually I didn't think I was even allowed to make a purchase my credit was not where I thought it was, so just kind of shopping around. I spoke with Leo and he made everything so smooth so clear so understanding and most importantly they got me approved on the car of my dreams and it was just an amazing experience and I would recommend all my friends and family, if you're looking for a nice used car with no games that are being played behind closed doors this is your used car dealer. 5 star rating for sure</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c34d723bf6bd5b:0x6101aab4240973e0</gmap_id></record>

Came in and had a great experience with Auto Retail Group. My first time buying a car and after looking around for over a month I came across a car I was interested in. Called the Dealership to confirm car availability and schedule an appointment ; arrived a bit late, but they were very friendly and accommodating to us. Sales person was great and knowledgeable with the car in addition to the whole car buying process. Test drive was better than others i have been on, he allowed me the option to test drive on the freeway. he helped us come to an agreement - when I had doubts, they insisted on me to test drive again to make sure I was happy with the car. Car buying is a long process, but ARG and the team walk us through the process in addition to provide different options made me satisfied with my purchase. Over all I am glad I found the car I wanted and  a great sales rep with a dealership that is in the business of being clear and transparent.

Thank you ARG , and I will truly recommend any of my family members to buy form Auto Retail Group</Text>

Just recently purchased a pre owned Mercedes-Benz from Raymond at Ballers IE and I must say my husband and I are very pleased with our car buying experience and would recommend Ballers to any and everyone of our friends and family and even to people we don't know.
If and when we plan to purchase another vehicle we will most defiantly go to ballers again first! Thank you Ballers IE!!!! And yes, we will come again.< /review>

Bad choice of a dealer to buy. They knew about the defects according to one of the workers
The car was defected and they did a Mickey mouse job to cover up the major oil leak it had.
I was helped buy a Hispanic GUY and his customer service was poor. And yes they do lie and change there prices....
When I called them to inform them about the defected car the guy said " did we put a gun to your head"  WOW! WITH THAT BEING SAID and one last thing, I was never told about my plates and all this time I waited 2 months. And finally informed me that plates were behind dealer plates.<//review>

Just bought a 2010 Toyota Camry from ARG. I didn’t feel no pressure, they sold me a great car. Price was right, monthly payment was near my budget. Amazing service, fast and easy process. No run arounds, super patient and helpful thoughout the whole process. I didn’t feel intimidated or uncomfortable. I would definitely buy another vehicle from here and recommend this place.<//Text>

Drove an hour and a half for an appointment there and when we arrived, the car was at the car wash. They took us to the car wash to see it and the car was in horrible condition with torn up seats, crayon markings all over the interior and lots of dents and scratches.</text>

<text>We received the most exceptional service. My husband and I came in and were greeted by Ramon. We had seen a Jeep wrangler on their websight. We took it for a test drive and fell in LOVE with it. All the staff went above and beyond to have us drive away with this beauty. We are now proud owners and couldn't be more happy. We highly recommend BALLERS AUTO SALES in the city of Rialto. New to our area but for sure will be a successful and growing busines.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c34d723bf6bd5b:0x6101aab4240973e0<//GmapID></record>

I was driving by late night and I had to use the restroom. The man was so very nice to let me use it without buying anything. More businesses should be like this.  There are very few places to use a restroom at 3:00am.<//text>

This place is shady and I wouldn't recommend trusting them with your money. Love when they have a line stretching outside the bank they only have two people working the teller booths while the  "bank manager" hides in his office space instead of operating a booth<//Review>

Covid is no excuse for the terrible customer service I've received while trying to secure financing. As soon as I voiced my frustrations and ask to speak with a higher authority I have been virtually stone walled and given the run around. I intentionally started banking here taking smaller loans as well as using them for several family businesses and creating a good reputation with altaone so that I could finance larger amounts in the future and as a "valued customer" they put me with a brand new finance officer who when submitting our request clearly did not notate any of this info which led to what I deem as an insulting tentative offer and has now dragged out the process much longer than I had anticipated it to take. I am extremely disappointed and unless they correct this BS situation I will be pulling all of my business and personal accounts from this branch.< /review>

<Review>I had a problem over four days trying to deposit a check through their ATMs. When I called in to see what the problem was, I was told they had no history of the transaction attempts nor any idea as to what the issue might be. I then used their moblie app to deposit my check. I called them back to see of there was any way to speed the deposit along so I might have access to my money, and I was told no: they had no way to speed the process along.<//Review>< Time>

Every interaction with AltaOne was terrible. They ended up costing us a really good interest rate with a credit union we were trying to finance with because they negated on promises and took three months getting paperwork to us that we needed.  I ended up having to call them multiple times a day for many days in a row to get them to complete what should have been done quickly. We will never go back.</review>

They canceled my my debit card and didnt tell me nor send me a new one when I called they said they would turn my card back on and they didnt. And i never had time to go in a get money so i maxed out my credit card. I'm so pissed. And then they took money out of my wifes account and made her go negative and said theres nothing they can do. After I get everything payed off I'm switching banks!<//text>

<Text>Terrible getting worse.

1. they dropped my interest rate from .20% to .05%. Navy Federal offers .25%

2. On their website, they no longer annotate who you wrote a check to or scan it.. so you have no clue who the check is to

Lazy, sloppy.. getting ready to go to Navy Federal.< /Text>< userid>

I honestly wanted to like this bank since I had family members working there, but after so many mess up's, I just couldn't do it anymore. The last straw was a paperwork transfer that took 4 months too long. When I tried to talk to someone about it, it was impossible to get the call center to transfer me to a manager. Save time and heartache, go to Desert Valley or Navy Fed.</review>

Spacious building with generous parking lot. If you are looking to refinance a loan, they have the ability in California to add or remove co-signers which is a plus.< /review>

This place is shady and I wouldn't recommend trusting them with your money. Love when they have a line stretching outside the bank they only have two people working the teller booths while the  "bank manager" hides in his office space instead of operating a booth</review>

Worst customer service ever. They don't ever get back to you when they say they would. You have to be chasing them to get any answers. I applied for a loan and got pre approved online thinking that they would contact me, is been a week and have not got one call from them. I reach out to them and they said they would call me back and still nothing. This place is a joke. Would not recommend at all.< /Review>

<text>Covid is no excuse for the terrible customer service I've received while trying to secure financing. As soon as I voiced my frustrations and ask to speak with a higher authority I have been virtually stone walled and given the run around. I intentionally started banking here taking smaller loans as well as using them for several family businesses and creating a good reputation with altaone so that I could finance larger amounts in the future and as a "valued customer" they put me with a brand new finance officer who when submitting our request clearly did not notate any of this info which led to what I deem as an insulting tentative offer and has now dragged out the process much longer than I had anticipated it to take. I am extremely disappointed and unless they correct this BS situation I will be pulling all of my business and personal accounts from this branch.<//text>< Pictures>

Not a good place to bank. Clueless employees and their mobile banking is horrendous, like something from 20 years ago. Hours are ridiculous, and if you do need to go to the branch office, plan to be there for a long time. This place is a hard pass!< /text>

<Review>My payment had failed due to banking error, due to my own technical mistake of not checking my bank account to see if they had actually  pulled funds out they put a repossession flag on my car, they called my home phone but no messages left so I was obviously unable to respond, unfortunately as soon as they put the repossession flag in place it also places a large fee so remove it. Sadly this bank issue seems to happen frequently and all they say is it must be my banking institution.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I then used their moblie app to deposit my check. I called them back to see of there was any way to speed the deposit along so I might have access to my money, and I was told no: they had no way to speed the process along.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

So done with altaone they used to be great but idk what happened to them. They canceled my my debit card and didnt tell me nor send me a new one when I called they said they would turn my card back on and they didnt. And i never had time to go in a get money so i maxed out my credit card. I'm so pissed. And then they took money out of my wifes account and made her go negative and said theres nothing they can do. After I get everything payed off I'm switching banks!</Text>

Terrible getting worse.

1. they dropped my interest rate from .20% to .05%. Navy Federal offers .25%

2. On their website, they no longer annotate who you wrote a check to or scan it.. so you have no clue who the check is to

Lazy, sloppy.. getting ready to go to Navy Federal.<//review>

This is my first time ordering food from the Red Jade. I was thrilled with the service and the food. The Dim Sum platter is exactly what I had hoped for, and the pork pot stickers and steamed bbq pork buns were a delight. The orange chicken was delivered with the sauce on the side so the chicken wasn’t all soggy. Great move. The delivery was prompt, food was hot and the delivery guy was very courteous. They even threw in extra bbq buns AND sesame balls . Holy heck! Great meal to celebrate the Chinese New Year. We will certainly order from here again.<//text>

Have been going here since 2009.  Waiters are friendly, food is delicious, and portions are pretty massive (compared to alot of other Chinese restaurants) and well worth the price.<//text>

I’ve eaten here a few times because of convenience and it’s always a letdown. There are far better options for Chinese food in the neighborhood. I’d recommend going to Big Lantern a couple blocks away.<//text>

If I could give them zero stars I would. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and just recently started having issues. Today I ordered the "Yee" wor wonton soup and the meat in the wontons tasted bad. I called the restaurant and the lady on the phone went from trying to solve my complaint to full on yelling within a matter of seconds. She claimed that she did not want to argue with me after I asked if they changed the meat in the wontons. She was very rude and made it seem as if I was the one with an attitude. The first issue I had a while back was, there was a fly in my soup and the only solution they came up with was to give me something free the next time. If I wasn't ill, I would not have ordered from them again and after the complete and utter disrespect I experienced today, I will not patronize this establishment ever again, I don't care how ill I am and need soup I did not desrve that treatment especially since I was polite and did not have an attitude.<//Text>

Sweet and sour chicken and kung pao chicken were nothing special, but were serviceable. The delivery itself was instantaneous and courteous, so this makes an acceptable delivery option.</review>

My favorite chinese takeout in town. The veggies are always crisp and fresh and the food isn't greasy. Don't be deterred by the signs at the end of the block, local traffic is allowed so you can drive right up to pickup.</Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>I am genuinely confused why this place has such high ratings...This is the most below average Chinese food I have had in a long time. we ordered the orange chicken and the chicken came with the sauce (which is a weird flavor to begin with and very thin, not thick sauce that you would expect) on the side? What? I have never seen that ever in ordering Chinese food. Everything else we ordered was I guess passable, but overall pretty disappointed.</text>< Pics>

I love this place. I always come here with my family creating a friendly banter with the waiters. The food is always delicious and piping hot. This place has a very nice and comfortable ambience. The music is always soft and relaxing.

Whenever I need some quick food before I go to work I order from here on GrubHub. It always arrives very quickly so the food is always hot. The food is packaged nicely and they always give 2 free pork buns with my orders.< /text>

Omggggg all I have to say is DELICIOUS!!!!! This place did not disappoint at all. Mouth watering food aghh yessss!!!!! The food isn’t greasy. It’s so tasty. The Mongolian beef we ordered actually has so much beef, you’re not just eating onions. They’re generous and not to expensive either. Amazing food for your money!!! Support them!!!

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I've eaten at a lot of Chinese food places and hands down this is the best!
The chicken sauce (General Tso) was not syrupy or too sweet and the chicken had just the right amount of crispy crunch to is while the meat was nice and moist!
Service was fast and pleasant, prices were WELL worth it for the portions received.
Absolutely excellent!< /text></record>

I’ve been ordering from here for the last 7 years or so. It’s always good! I usually get string beans, hot and sour soup, and fried rice. They’re consistently on time and accurate with delivery. The location is great to dine-in as well: Can’t ask for much else in my go-to Chinese food spot!< /text>

A pretty classic Chinese restaurant. Good options, reasonable prices, fast service. I also like that they do their own delivery rather than one of the apps.<//text>< Pictures>

Great Chinese restaurant in the Market /Church area. Fast service in and they also deliver free when you order a $20.00 minimum.< /Text>

Forget all that mess in Chinatown......this is the best Chinese restaurant I've found so far in San Francisco!!! TIP: if you're looking for great orange chicken make sure you order sesame chicken....that's what you are looking for. Their orange chicken here is chicken with the sauce as a side dipping sauce.  Don't make that mistake.remember....sesame chicken is what you want... it's orange flavored.</text>

<text>The food was pretty decent. For the price that you are paying it is definitely worth it. However I would not consider it to be anything special compared to all the other Chinese places around San Francisco.<//text>< date>

When ordering appetizers they bring half the order out, then half entrees. Then ask them why the entrees before the appetizers.? I will check sorry then they come back and only say it's coming. I high recommend Eric's 1500 Church  Street better quality of food and better service!< /Text>

I give Red Jade 1 star because there is not an option for zero stars. We have ordered in the past and it was always hit or miss, tonight was an exception. The beef was chewy, old, and inedible. The chow mein was burnt, greasy and also tasted old. This was a truly disappointing experience and I would caution anyone from eating at Red Jade.< /text>

This place is an old school neighborhood gem...nothing pretentious, just huge portions of tasty food. The specials are the bomb, don't miss the Happy Family and the Mongolian Lamb. Vegetarian options are good, too. Plus friendly service, and sake!</Review>

<review>Thanks Red Jade for the food last night and delivering during Pride Weekend for us.  We didn't feel like going out and for whatever reason I don't get, you were recommended for delivery for us via Eat24 App and you had to come to the TL for delivery.

Your delivery guy was polite and double checked my order before driving away to make sure it was correct.

I've been on a quest to try Broccoli from everywhere I can so I eat more of it and your Szechuan Sauteed Broccoli was lovely!  Thanks again Red Jade<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>My boyfriend is obsessed! We have been here three times in the past three weeks. The sesame chicken is the best item on the menu. I have also gotten the orange chicken which I did not like at all as it was way too sweet and pork chow mein, which was very good. Quick service for quality Chinese at a decent price. Definitely check it out if you're in the area for lunch or dinner.</Text>< Name>

<review>Some of the best American-Chinese food in the city.  They have dependable delivery.  Always easy to get a table.  Lunch pricing is great.  Food is fresh.  This is one of the most popular Chinese restaurants in the city for locals.  If you are a tourist and looking for authentic Chinese food go to chinatown.<//review><GmapID>0x808f7e1e627214bd:0x8f4456669b364afe< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Excellent food. This is my go-to Chinese restaurant on Grubhub. But this evening I went into the restaurant for full sit-down service.

Very clean, comfortable restaurant, conveniently located at Market & Church, do close to several Muni lines (buses and trains). The food is always excellent. Amazing soups, potstickers, fried rice, noodles... Everything I've ordered is always delicious. But my favorites are their eggplant dishes (house specialty is terrific), sesame chicken, beef & green beans and mushroom chicken.<//Text>

Loved it! My second time and I felt so good after  each meal! They also have a phenomenal Chinese hot sauce which I couldn't resist and bought some from them plus is very delicious tea that I bought from them too. Very reasonable price for high quality.< /review>

The food is great, staff is friendly, and the place is kept clean and neat at all times. On top of those, the price is very reasonable - actually below the average considering its location. The lunch special of "Twice-cooked pork"  is what I always get - it even comes with soup of the day!</Text>

We’ve Order from redJade before and it’s been alright.  Tonight, when we first tasted the meat entree it was very chewy, smelled old and left a weird taste in my mouth.  The chowMein noodles were burnt and in a puddle of oil.   The orange chicken tasted old and  fishy which means that the frying oil needs to be switched out. It was absolutely inedible.  We called REDJaDE for a refund and even offered to bring the food back to the restaurant.  They said that returning the food was not necessary and that we needed to contact grubHUB for the refund.  We contacted GrubHUB who then contacted REDJADE to approve the refund and they denied it!!!!!  This went back and worth between GRUBhub, REDJaDE, and US for about 40mins.  After being hung up on a third time grubHUB offered $10 since they would not be able to do the  full refund without REDJaDEs approval.  BEWARE!!!!!!   Customer service and food quality lacks at REDJADE!!!!!!  Save your MONEY and your stomachs people!</review>

Great food.  Inexpensive, complete lunch every day until 5pm.  Try their Dim Sum lunch.  Just as God as what you can have in Chinatown.  Also, prawns with lobster sauce and seseme chicken.< /text>

Pretty authentic Chinese food that you can share family style. We got General Tso's Chicken, which was tasty but kind of airy. The Green Onion Pancake was delicious and very filling for an appetizer. Great location on Church Street!</Text>

Fast, reliable, decent portion, and not-so-expensive for the neighborhood. I'm so happy this place exists. Hong Kong pan fried noodles (with chicken instead of seafood), and shrimp scramble are my two favorites.< /Text>

<Text>I came here years ago with my sister and my brother-in-law the food was really good and I've been coming here since there's been a few times mishaps,but it's all good I'm still coming here because it is cheap they give you a lot of food took my cousin here he liked it their lunch specials from 11 to 5
So give them a try if you haven't been here. The only thing I don't like is you don't have the same waiter so sometimes it could get confusing if you want something from one and then another one comes and then I'm like okay who's my waiter now? I know one takes the order someone else brings the food brings food then bring check& picks up the check. lol<//Text>< pictures>

Quick and easy service for a few Chinese staples - dumplings, general tso's chicken (good broccoli, too), and green onion pancake.  Nothing fancy, but gets the job done.< /Review>

<review>Had the crab fried rangoon and the peking duck ($11 for half a duck). It was fantastic. Peking duck in other Chinese restaurants usually comes with fatty layers that you need to strip away to get at the good lean meat. This was either stripped (save me the trouble) or the duck was chosen to not be fatty. Either way, it was really a delicious meal. I glanced at other people's General Tsao's... I'm getting that next time.

Bonus was at the end they give you little seasame balls, but they're usually not very fresh (they have a relatively large bin of seasame balls to grab from when they hand out the checks).< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>The food is so good. Fair size portions for the price. Out door dining due to covid-19 August 2020.

The food is amazing I’ve never been disappointed! The best thing on the planet is their chocolate dipped ice cream cone and eating while it’s melting all over you as you take a slow stroll by the river.< /text>

Nice place.just wish they would  not use lard in there beans and other foods. Heart friendly oils would be so much better! The waitress was friendly  and food was served in a timely  matter. Overall nice, casual dining.< /text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>It was evening, and cool out. They had all the fans on in the place,  and it was freezing! We had to eat on the "patio". Still inside, but another room where there were no fans on. We only ordered two bowls of soup which were very good.  It took us over half an hour to get them.  I think the soup was in the refrig or freezer, and they had to warm it.  Service was good,  it wasn't her fault about how long the Soup took.  Menu seemed a little pricey for Mexican food $10 to $15 a plate. $10 for a bowl of soup about two cups.   I'd go back again.< /Review>< pics>

The place doesn't look too impressive, and the wait for the food was a little long but the food was excellent. The shredded beef tacos that I had we're cooked to perfection, and my friends lover their choices as well. This is a great little spot to have your lunch or dinner in Kern. Best Mexican food around by far. Thank you El Rio.<//Text>

I moved earlier this year from San Diego- where there's killer Mexican food EVERYWHERE u go. I Iived here 6 months before I learned Rios existed. I was so excited to realise there was a place to satisfy my delicious Mexican food cravings. I was also nervous it just wouldn't be as good as I'm used to. I WAS IMPRESSED- the flavor is spectacular! A little pricy but well worth it considering the area. As a bonus, its also a killer ice cream stop my kids and I frequent regularly. Their ice cream is delicious and not expensive at all- a satisfying family break anytime!</Text>

Good, small, local Mexican restaurant
For me, whenever a Mexican restaurant has wine based margaritas, it's a one point deduction...everything else is good, though.</Text>

I LOVE this place. I no longer live in the KRV but I have been coming here since they opened in 2002. My favorite has always been the bean and cheese burrito. I know. Lame right? But it's SOO good! You can't get them this good anywhere trust me I've tried. This place keeps me coming back for more 15 years later. 😁❤️< /text>

They were happy and healthy. Great place to socialize your pup with other dogs. Can watch them on puppy cam and there is always a person supervising. They are grouped by size so smaller dogs aren't intimidated by the big ones. You can board or send to day care. The staff is very helpful and pleasant. Would highly recommend Camp Bow Wow.

<text>Camp Bow Wow is simply awesome!  The staff are excellent and so caring, and show a lot of love to the dogs and make them feel safe.  Safety is obviously a priority.  We feel confident leaving our young dog with them and it's simply wonderful that the dogs get to play together instead of being locked up in cages most of the day which is standard for most boarding facilities.  Excellent place and so glad we found Camp Bow Wow.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I love that I can check on them via the webcams. As a dog parent it gives you a nice  piece of mind.<//Text>

< Review>
I am new to this area and came across camp bow wow and was very interested to take my puppy there. My pup had her interview and she passed (yay) and she was able to join right away. The facility is kept cleanly and seems to be well supervised. I love the fact I’m able to check on my pup with their camera features, it gets me through my busy days! I’ll be bringing her in for daycare more often.<//Review>

They have a convenient drop-off procedure, friendly staff and my pup loves going there.  I think for playful dogs, like mine, it is ideal, as they have various play areas and group dogs of similar size and temperament together.  Live video monitoring in each play area, so you can check on your pup whenever you like.<//review>

<Review>So glad I found Camp Bow Wow for my dog, Tommy. Friendly staff, very clean facility. Tommy did two day cares and had a great time, very happy dog when I picked him up. He just did an all day play and then spent the night. Again he was a very happy boy when I picked him up, I have no doubt he had a great time. So glad and relieved I found a great place to leave him when I travel or if I am out of the house for the day.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

They are kind, friendly, knowledgeable, and very concerned about the welfare of the dogs in their care. Dogs have to go through an interview with them before being allowed to stay there. While that might seem like a little bit of a hassle, it really put my mind at ease that my dog would be in the company of other dogs that were well socialized. They have extended hours, which really helps me with my work schedule. They are always happy and willing to attend to any special requirements your dog might need. They have webcams so you can watch the pups at play all day (which is very addictive!). The facility is clean and friendly, and I can't say enough about their amazing customer service.!</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>We ended up taking our puppy to Camp Bow Wow at the Fair Oaks, CA location as the closest Camp Bow Wow location to our home would not accept our puppy due to their breed restrictions. The staff at Fair Oaks CBW were very nice and knowledgeable. They took our puppy in with no hesitation. She passed her interview and was allowed to play with the other dogs there. As we waited for her to go through her interview, we watched her on the monitor and also had the chance to speak with other dog parents who have frequently used that location. Each of them highly reccommended the Fair Oaks CBW. We will definitely have no problem making the almost hour drive to Fair Oaks to allow our puppy a play day here and there. We will also be using them for boarding when we go on vacation.</review>< Pictures>

< review>
I am desperate for a good, high quality DayCare for my little dog.
I completed the online request last night.
They called me several times today when I was out and I missed the call, don't have voice mail .
I SPENT ALL DAY TRYING TO CALL THEM.
AROUND EIGHT CALLS.
ALL I EVER GOT WAS THEIR ANSWERING MACHINE.
SO, NO
I NEEDED HELP ASAP.
SO, I FINALLY  GET A CALL TONITE, AFTER 5:00 PM
I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE MY DOG TO A DAY CARE THAT WILL NOT ANSWER THE PHONE!<//review>

<text>Well, she loved Oliver the most and I hear he rode around on her shoulder while he purred in her ear and that her pictures of his conniving ways filled her phone.  She obviously knows and loves cats and I found I felt much better about going off without them when they were kindly treated and spoiled there.  They didn't actually say they liked it there but they weren't freaked out and seemed calm and happy when I got them back and I know they ate well and got to use their own toys and  "S" scratcher.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>This place really puts the "special" into special occasion. I've had very good omakase before, but I can't remember ever being so happy in my mouth with every bite that I was actually angry. Loved the mismatched pottery and the extensive sake menu as well. The service was fantastic. Will definitely be back again for another special occasion!</text>< UserId.>

<Text>Robin is amazing. The food, service, decor, vibe and everything is amazing. It is very different from traditional japanese omakasa, very creative and original in excellent ways.

Our favorite omakase experience on the west coast, keeps us flying out from Miami to get our fix. Your server will ask you, essentially, ‘what’s your budget/how hungry are you?’ so they can tailor the experience for you and your guest(s). Every single piece of nigiri is so thoughtfully planned and always executed to perfection. If you’re on the fence, stop thinking about it and just go! You won’t be disappointed.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>One of my fave places period in SF. Outstanding modern take on omakase-style dining. They're not afraid to experiment with outstanding non-traditional ingredients and I'm thankful for that. Very. One tip: I'm usually not a fan of their soup/noodle dishes so I ask for fish/nigiri substitutions (accepting any requisite up-charges as needed of course).<//text>< Pictures>

Great omakase joint with different price points that cater to how hungry and adventurous you are. This is by far my favorite sushi joint in San Fran.</Review>

<text>Robin strays away from the typical omakase and presents a more contemporary experience with unique combinations and local ingredients!

We made a reservation for dinner and would recommend booking in advance - despite being one of the first parties of the night, the restaurant filled up quickly and was bustling throughout the evening. The interior is super cute and trendy; I loved the wall behind the bar, and the mix of rustic/modern decor. The atmosphere inside feels upscale yet comfortable instead of stuffy - I especially enjoyed their hip hop playlist (definitely not a common occurrence during your normal omakase, lol).

We opted to sit at the sushi bar instead of a table. As expected, sitting at the counter is much more interactive and it was a lot of fun engaging with our awesome sushi chef! He was very personable and interjected fun moments into our meal, such as catering to certain guests when he would torch or plate something, so they could get it on video. Even though he was taking care of three different parties in our corner of the bar, we never felt neglected.

As for the omakase itself, Robin lets you personalize your experience by choosing your price range, between $89-189. As first timers, we chose the recommended $130, and let our chef take the reins. In total, we consumed about 25 pieces of nigiri and small dishes over about a two-hour period. This seems like a lot, but we were reasonably satisfied and not painfully full after. The pace was good in that it wasn't too fast, and we had time to enjoy and savor each course, but not too slow, and we didn't have too much downtime between each plate.

I won't go into too much detail about the courses since it's likely to change over time or based on the chef, but it does seem like there's some recurring ones that they usually include. It's far from a traditional omakase, but that's what was fun and unpredictable about it. I really loved the creative presentation and unique flavor and ingredient combinations! It was exciting to watch our chef prepare the next course and have no idea what sort of interesting dish would be pumped out next. Some notable courses were: the potato chip and caviar nigiri, tuna with beef fat nigiri, tuna tartare with mushroom aioli, sesame noodles with shaved truffle, wagyu and frozen foie gras nigiri, and literally everything with uni - so creamy and delicious!

Of course, we weren't mindblown every single time, but I feel like that's to be expected when there's 25 courses. Overall, all were tasty, and some were especially excellent. What really brought the whole experience together for me were the "vibes" - from
the moment we walked in, it felt very hip and low-pressure. The staff was welcoming but not overbearing in any sort of way. However, this didn't detract from how nice it was, nor from the quality of the food or service. I wouldn't hesitate to come back again to try an omakase at a lower or higher price point, or to introduce friends to a good time and meal!<//text><gmapID>0x80858098726e0c21:0x9ffcb33f1d9fef23< /gmapID><Response>None< /Response>< rating>

<gmap_id>0x80858098726e0c21:0x9ffcb33f1d9fef23< /gmap_id><Review>Very inventive and modern omakase experience. Unique fish types and taste combinations. Pricing starts at $89 and goes up to $175 per person. You tell them how much you want to spend in that range and they start bringing dishes out.

Sit at the counter. Much better experience than the tables. It's a small restaurant and they play loud music so don't expect a quiet night out.

Wide range of sake by the glass and bottle. It's okay if you don't know much about sake, the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I call this the "Fancy Sushi" i had a wonderful experienced at Robin. Omakase Style when we first got there the host was just lovely he seated us at our table and our waiter came a minute after which she was an angel so helpful explaining everything. If your new at Robin and have a budget always talk to the waiter and make sure he/she knows. Our food was just amazing it was fresh and tasty every dish is different and yummy. Overall we got 13 different dishes 14 if we count the dessert. Every penny was worth it.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80858098726e0c21:0x9ffcb33f1d9fef23< /Gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>20 courses for less than $130! I think that's an amazing deal given the quality. Definitely highly recommend it.

<Review>One of the most interesting omakase experiences I’ve had! Of course, sit at the bar if you can - that’s the money seat, being able to watch their rotation of sushi chefs create masterpieces. If you can, opt for the omakase - you won’t be disappointed.

Hip hop fills the restaurant as you try different pieces of fish. The servers are all chill and down to earth, creating an atmosphere that’s cool.

The fish is incredibly thoughtful with some creative combinations. I couldn’t begin to recite them all so check out the photos. 10/10 recommend for good times and good food. Make a reservation! Go to Smuggler’s while you wait or after your meal!< /Review><time>1574042994010< /time></record></dataset><record>

This restaurant blew me away! Not only does the chef source the best fish but chef layers the flavors and pairs flavors that you don't normally see with one another. Also what's great is you can pay whatever you want - from $89-$189...and no matter what you choose you won't be disappointed. We chose $130 and thses are just HALF of the courses. This is def not on my top 5 restaurants in SF</Text>

If you prefer traditional sushi omakase restaurants then this is not for you. It’s more modernized and mixes various flavors. They use a lot of uni and caviar so be ready for that.

I personally like both traditional and more modern fusion flavored omakase, but this one is quite saucy and intense in flavor. Maybe because they use uni, caviar and truffle too much. They can use less of those and have more variety. By the end of the meal I was so ready to be done. There were a few pieces that really stood out, mostly in the beginning of the meal though.

My friend who recommended this place really really enjoyed it which is why I think totally depends on what type of sushi you prefer.<//Review>

<text>What can I say that’s hasn’t been said? This place is great if you want omakase. The staff is friendly and welcoming. We got a table the same night, made reservations 30 min prior and didn’t wait long for our seats. Everything was just on point and the food was delicious!</text>< username>

SF is teaming with omakasi places these days.  I love that because in general I hate menus and would prefer a resturant to feed me what they think is best (ala chez panisse).  We had this amazing omakasi sushi meal at Robin last night.  The price tag was not for the faint of wallet, but for the one time experience that's ok.  And what an experience!  Almost 20 items, all unique and delicious.  Lots of local fish and seafood, plus specialties from Japan.  All in all an amazing treat.< /review>

<review>Phenomenally fresh fish and unique in many ways, from the service ("what was your least favorite dish?", "how full are you? 25% 50%?") to hyper local shopping at the farmer's market to buying entire tuna fish, then serving you different parts in the same set.

Japanese traditionalists will hate this place, and if you judge on flaws, you'll find plenty to pick on -- but if you are looking for innovation, Robin delivers.< /review>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Loved our modern omakase at Robin. Fresh fish prepared with novel sauces and toppings. I had had some misgivings about finishing the entire 16 piece (plus extras) omakase. Before our meal, our waitress had kindly informed us that we could "tap out" at any time, which we ended up doing at $115/189 of out meal. Was pleasantly surprised by the bill 😊< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>So good. It was awesome. No spice tuna rolls here. Just fresh fish perfectly paired in new and unique ways. Omakase at its best. The fish just kept coming. I wish I had taken notes or that they provided a list because all was very very good and some was just incredible. But there were so many courses (and there was a little sake involved) so now I don’t remember. I do remember one (I think skipjack) that had truffle butter, truffle salt and truffle. So good!

And at first I was a little put off by the music but I really started to enjoy it after a course or two and by the time we finished I thought it fit the vibe perfect. It was a great play list!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPks7jaBk8pSuI2G66wIzQGzjJ6i1UGRg2b4IAk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5BOYYoZ48077k8VnMXt1d8sD6RrwRD6Dq8frU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_Rluhwd5FBlsks2W8t7DBspIhWtIs1UCam4Vx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmXD5W6JUnzf1udMPflkRAoGvXtn0vHVN-0uDF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNe-5eGOlhAmuf9dhfm8hXoSXxPLAFhwK2F_rX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKx2TmUR2-pR5yzR3fKX0TEaeJwF_ETVDFAnm-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOneAqH_rGFYAK_5I_TP1OcLSG7OP-xr1f26gU7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

It is loud that I cannot listen to the food....

Service: waitress walking back and forth all the time and in a fast pace. It is very disturbing as if eating and sitting in a busy traffic.

Food: ordered $150 per person omakase. Below is what we get. Nigiri course is very well done. Sashimi course though is too heavy with source. All fish cut is smaller / thinner then most of the fine sushi place. Overall well done but nothing really stands out.</Review>< username>

This bird can sing! Although this Robin’s songs don’t come cheap. We paid $130 per person for the mid-level omakase, which had 15 courses including a wagyu sushi, 3 slightly larger shared plates, and a soup. No desserts, no menu.

Beautiful plating, great flavors with some inventive (potato chip sushi was a fave). Wish the pace was a bit faster, but the chef explains every dish to each guest.< /text>

It was such a great experience. Very unusual pairing sushi with herbs, truffle, sauces, and even foie gras.
4 stars for the atmosphere. The place is not very cozy. You get to see a lot of homeless people passing by the restaurant since the restaurant has floor to ceiling windows. I would say best seats are at the bar, so this way your view will be on chefs not on the street.
4 stars for service - 3 people were serving us but only one was smiling and willing to answer our questions about food.< /Text><gmapID>0x80858098726e0c21:0x9ffcb33f1d9fef23</gmapID>< Rate>

Omakase was amazing. I personally prefer less sauce to experience the purity of the meat, but having said that the flavors are still really great!< /text>

<text>I loved the whole experience! I had no idea what an omakase restaurant was so this was my first time. Every single plate was absolutely delicious! The steak tartare was amazing and also the noodles with Australian black truffle were to die for!! Every single plate was served on a specially designed ceramic that made them more interesting. The service was excellent and the ambience was eclectic and nice. No wonder there was not even one empty table or seat at the sushi bar!</text><GmapID>0x80858098726e0c21:0x9ffcb33f1d9fef23<//GmapID>< Date>

Went with a friend on a Tuesday night so it wasn't too busy, but still pretty full. The food was so fresh and the flavors were amazing! The only thing that was lacking was the fact that they took out the dishes one after the other, even when we didn't finish eating the previous one.
But overall the good was really good! 💯<//Text>

The staff was wonderful and friendly. They were attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  Our chef described everything to us and even made us something we suggested! The food was delicious; there was not one piece of sushi or dish that I didn't like. The atmosphere was cozy and the resturant was stylishly decorated. Great place to visit for a special occasion or if you are here visiting!< /text>

Each and every piece of food prepared packed an incredible flavor experience. Trendy decor and hip music add to the dining experience. I was surprised that the base omakase price filled me up as I usually eat more. The price is well worth the quality and quantity of the food you will enjoy here.</text>

Wow mate, I did not get ripped off like this in a while.

The chef will ask you how much you want to spend that day as soon as you sit down telling you that it ranges from $89 to $189. Not only this is a super awkward conversation to have when you first sit down since it makes you feel like you can spend $89+tax+tip and end up having something "low-end", they also do not stick to your request. I was charged $130 for my meal even though I asked the $89 option. The argument they have is that towards the end they asked "how is your appetite doing", and I said "it's great". Then they gave me 3 more nigiris and a very unnecessary dessert. I probably should have said "please do not give me more food".

I am still very confused about this experience and don't know what went wrong, how come this is actually legal. Ugh, change your pricing structure, communication and attitude, or please go out of business.<//review>

<review>This was an excellent choice for my birthday dinner. We loved the sake, the sushi, and all the non-sushi small dishes served as part of the Omakase. You get to choose your budget (between ~$89-$189 per person) and the chef just serves you delicious food. Dessert was also great.<//review>< Time>

<Review>Robin's mix of Japanese and California flavors has made it a perfect deviation from the various, more "purist" omakase spots in San Francisco. The fish is always super fresh, service is attentive yet relaxed, and the pacing of each individual menu always has some unexpected surprises.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80858098726e0c21:0x9ffcb33f1d9fef23</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Almost all the dishes prepared by the chef is sushi or sashimi but the flavors were well balanced and you don't feel that you are eating a raw fish at all. Chef really put a lot of thinking behind each of the dishes. And I feel that there is always surprise from plate to plate. It's highly recommend.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>For the price for the quality was just okay. Each piece of sushi was smaller than what I have seen at other restaurants. The person talking our order recommended a sake and then came back with a different brand because she indicated that she was thinking of this other brands when talking our order.  They served bluefin Tuna which is a threatened species of fish.  On the plus side, the fish did taste good and I liked the atmosphere.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

What a cool place! I was surprised how full we left. So many small and cool dishes. Surprising relaxed atmosphere for how fancy the food is. Only complained were the noisy high rollers beside us, Nothing the restaurant did.</Review>

This is a strictly omakase style restaurant but the meal consists almost entirely of sushi. You are offered a range of price points for the meal starting at around $90 and up to more than $150. You are not offered a menu for the food.  The service is friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. You never eat a piece of fish that hasn’t been identified as to the type and origin. The sushi is prepared in a traditional style but with inventive twists on the classic preparations. The fish is clearly still the star of the show here. Our meal was of the highest quality. It is expensive but definitely worth the price.  The sake list is excellent and fairly priced.  if you feel like splurging on a meal in San Francisco I can’t think of a better place to do it.<//Text>

< Review>
One of the most unique omakase places I've been to in the city. If you're looking for a non-traditional and unique Omakase, this is the spot. The service is amazing, and the meal is really an experience to remember. From the plating to the description of each meal, everything is carefully considered. I usually spend around $200 per person here without drinks. Definitely worth it!!< /Review>

<Text>This new and trendy sushi place in Hayes Valley as a very interesting atmosphere and fantastic wine selection. It was pretty hard to get a reservation for Robin and that we went there after waiting for a while but the associate said was a little underwhelming and to experimental for my taste. There's definitely a lot going on with with the Creations but that the focus on quality and an execution is missing.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Robin is the meal you never want to end. The place is buzzy. Set in a casual but intimate environment. Sit at the bar with a friend or a date to maximize the experience. Chef Dan is awesome and has taken care of me the last 3 times I've been in.< /review>

<text>If you haven't been to Robin in San Francisco you must! Omakase in a Japanese restaurant, you would leave it up to the chef. It's a meal consisting of different dishes selected by the chef. It is an experience, a concept, and there is no menu.... Omakase style ! J'adore ! What a ride, what a foodie journey. Even the sake, and Crémant are memorable. This was absolutely an unforgettable BIRTHDAY! We were at the bar and taken care of by the Owner, Karina, Mya and Blair.... This crew is a well-oiled machine and deliver such an amazing masterpiece. Let them know if you have any allergies and enjoy the adventure! #foodporn This place is truly one of the sexiest any restaurants in town.</text><user_name>Beck Marquis<//user_name><date>1568564442270< /date>< Pics>

Overall Robin is a very modern take on omakase not only in the style of nigiri, but also in the vibe of the restaurant. It feels like a hip upscale LA eatery but has the delicate flavors and service a high quality Japanese establishment.

I'll definitely be returning for many date nights in the future.< /Text>

Food was okay. A few of the dishes had too much flavour which meant the fish taste got lost sometimes. Service outside of the chefs were horrendous though. Would it kill you to not look angry or impatient all the time.< /text>

You want to try something different and amazing this is the place to be. I'm not sure if I would call her Sushi experience a traditional authentic experience it's more like a modern authentic experience with items that are going to taste so great you will be amazed. The server also are sushi chef was with us the whole meal as if you were part of our group. He was a wonderful guy with a wonderful attitude and definitely knew what he was doing. Be prepared to whip out a lot of cash. The bill for my friend and I was over $400 besides we did drink two bottles of sake and that definitely added a lot of money to the check. I think it would have been $220 had wenot have the booze. Also they let you choose cheaper levels that I think are just a little bit less food or on the contrary if you want to spend more they have packages for that to accommodate you as well. Great place to take a date and make a special night that you won't forget!!l< /Review>

<text>Interesting and experimental approach to omakase, many things I had never seen before (way beyond "oh we put some yuzu jalapeno garnish on this sushi"). Definitely recommend sitting at the counter as the chefs all seem to be friendly and knowledgeable. We were seated with chef Eric and had a great time, we felt very relaxed and comfortable.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80858098726e0c21:0x9ffcb33f1d9fef23< /gmapID></record>

Something different but familiar. Well executed Californian influenced omakase offering. Tons of fun! Well designed with lots of attention to detail.</Text>

Incredibly delicious. Very inventive use of sesame, charring, fingerlime, scallops, tuna, fruits. Will return (130 option is a rather larger portion, so plan accordingly)< /text>

Don't believe the hype.

Horrible experience all around, but especially the shadiness of the pricing structure, and that it is a very high-end restaurant with very high-end prices masquerading as an approachable almost shabby establishment.

I couldn't hear our server over the extremely loud 90's music, which I asked to lower and was refused, so all the explanations of the dishes unintelligible.

I left with a headache (from the music and the over saltiness of the food), and having the feeling of being robbed...a feeling that I expected from a night in the Tenderloin but not from a $130+ a plate restaurant (that price doesn't include drinks).</text>

Please do better, Robin. I want to like you, but this was so disappointing. I was really surprised at how unaccommodating the omakase service is for vegetarians. Yes, it’s a sushi restaurant, but one that is priding itself on creativity/non-traditional approaches and vegetarianism is a really common diet in the Bay for which I have NEVER had an issue being served an alternate tasting menu. Except here. My boyfriend received numerous courses while I sat there awkwardly, watching him eat, with nothing. This is pretty telling of a rigidity and lack of creativity in the kitchen that doesn’t justify these prices. The 3 items I was served (one of which was dessert) were a bit over-sauced, but also tiny! If you can’t supply variety, at least ensure I don’t leave hungry. I got the same tiny portion of ramen, but just in a larger plate. Please come up w some veg dishes. Every other restaurant is capable of accommodating this conscientious preference.< /review>

Great concept and quality food, but overpriced even among its peers. Tasting menu is a bit repetitive at points and doesn't pay much homage to its edomai heritage. Really cool space though.< /review>

Fun atmosphere and attentive service. Loved the beautiful ceramics. But food was just okay. I guess I prefer more traditional omakase where less is more. Here at Robin most of the pieces were too saucy and way too powerful in flavors for my palate (like mixing two bold flavors of foie gras and wagyu beef in one piece).</text>

<Text>If you can afford it, the experience is unforgettable. The flavor pairings of the 10ish pieces of nigiri we had were exceptional and creative. I literally got chills from the first bite, something I didn't know was possible for food to accomplish. I am a little disappointed now, though, that the bar has been set so high, it will be a long time before I find anything that compares. Bravo.<//Text><Time>1509754276822< /Time><user_name>Anthony A</user_name>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) The most delicious place I've ever eaten in San Francisco. In particular, there are a variety of dishes made with uni and the freshness of uni is good. The atmosphere is not bad and the chef is friendly. I ate a bottle of two set of sake, but it was over $ 500. Quite expensive

최근 샌프란시스코에서 먹은 스시집중에 가장 맛있었던 곳. 특히 우니로 하는 요리가 다양하고 우니의 신선도가 좋다. 분위기도 나쁘지 않고 셰프가 친절하다. 오마카제 두명 세트 사케 한병 먹었는데 5백불 좀 넘게 나왔다. 가격이 꽤나 비싼곳<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Japanese, very very good. Each dish that you bring with the menu is delicious. In this restaurant there is no menu, you only have two menus to choose one of 89 euros (which is the one we chose) and another of 189 that is the same as the 89 but you choose the type of fish you want to predominate in the dishes They bring you. If we add wine or drink, it's not a cheap place, but in San Francisco, you eat very well, but the price is high. I put the photos of all the dishes on the menu for 89 euros.

It's fresh and healthy! But you need to wait for at least 15-20 mins even though there were just few customers...<//Review>

< review>
The cashiers are always nice and friendly, but now its just gotten seriously bad. This is my 5th visit and my smoothie yet again is like a slushed icee NOT a smoothie. So very disappointing. I truly stopped going there for a while because of this issue and I tell the cashier please make sure they blend my drink well.

I wont be going back! I shouldnt have to ask someone to blend my smoothie. I mean the chuncks in my drinks are from the ice so I have to chew it down in order to swallow it. This isn't just bits of ice. To bad they are the only Jamba Juice in Redwood City, looks like I will be going to San Carlos for proper smoothies.<//review>

This place never fails if your hungry for some good quick food this is the spot!! Chili cheese fries are delicious 🤤 plenty of chili and cheese on it, pastrami sandwich is huge with a lot of meat, fried zucchini is good and has a crunchy to it, chicken sandwich is delicious white meat and it’s flavorful and moist veggies are always fresh!</Text>

I only tried the Chili Cheese Fries 🤢🤢🤮🤮 It was disgusting. The Chili tasted old and tainted. Had a very distinct taste and a red hue. Bought a large and it barely filled the plate but that was good because I took a couple bites and tossed it in the trash.< /text>

First time here and not my last. They have orange BANG not many places do and they get points for that. Howvere they maybe slightly priced it is well worth it the portions are amazing. Plus any place that can accommodate my picket daughter sending food back every 2 minutes and do it with a smile is A1 in my book. Now check out my food pics because that is what you came here for lol<//Review>

Every time I come here they make me wait at the drive through and don’t say anything. This last time the girl was laughing when she came on the headset the food is great.

First time here and not my last. They have orange BANG not many places do and they get points for that. Howvere they maybe slightly priced it is well worth it the portions are amazing. Plus any place that can accommodate my picket daughter sending food back every 2 minutes and do it with a smile is A1 in my book. Now check out my food pics because that is what you came here for lol< /review>

Before they weren’t maybe it’s because of the pandemic and I know customers/ppl can have horrible attitudes. Take it out on them. I’m a firm believer that the customer is NOT always right.

<Text>I went to Mr J's Burgers today (2/25/21) at around 4:18 pm. The employee taking the drive thru orders was incredibly rude to me. This is the third time this has happened to me with this individual. I drove up to the menu board to have my order taken and she very rudely told me, "What do you want?" I really wanted my food so I let the passive aggressive attitude slide, but when she asked me what drink I wanted she had a very nasty tone! I simply left the drive thru after this bad encounter.  My family and I will no longer  be going to this fast food restaurant. I do not want to be treated like this, especially when I have given my business to this establishment since 2012. Oh well, all things come to an end.< /Text>< Time>

You know it's not the same. The guacamole they put with the carne asada fries is now very liquidy avacado with water. The chicken salad is placed in a smaller pack with thinner chicken. It's okay.<//Text>

Always fresh and good food. Not a fan of main chains and need to find a great burger and it happen to be Mr J's. I really like the beef patty burgers as well as their chicken fried steak sandwich. the cashier is always nice and very prompt with the customer service.< /text>

<review>Amazing as always. I usually order a chicken salad but I opted for a chicken breast sandwich and wasn't disappointed. The lettuce is crisp, juicy tomato, perfectly seasoned chicken breast, and the wheat bun just brings it home. 😋 Add a cup of ranch for dipping and pouring on top of each bite and you've got yourself one mighty fine dinner. Happy to be a regular here. 👍</review>< pictures>

If I could give 0 stars I definitely would.
I don’t know what’s happened to this place in the last couple years, but it’s all gone down hill.
From the food to the CUSTOMER SERVICE. The broads that work there have a major attitude. Especially the ones that have been working there most of their miserable lives and it reflects.
I tried giving them the benefit of the doubt, but when I realized that it’s at any time of the day I was like “umm yeah, no.”
One day they’re going to come across the right one...
Definitely take your business elsewhere. Shoot I know I am.</Text>

<Text>I have been going her for years and never had a bad experience but just now I had the worst experience. We were waiting in drive thru for 10 min before the lady taking orders decided to help us after we had been saying hello several times. As she was taking our order she was rude about us changing our order from zucchini to regular fries keep in mind we hadn't paid yet or said we were done ordering!! She kept talking to someone and was saying I don't know why they are changing their order like it was a burden.When we pulled up to the window she open the window and said hi and just closed it, I don't understand the need for that. She seems like she was having a bad day. This is unacceptable behavior for customer service! Hope to not get assisted by her next time we go. Besides this food was great like always!!< /Text>< rating>

DEAD BUG IN MY SALAD!! went to have lunch here and instead i lost my appetite due to a dead fly in my salad which i almost ate. I'm glad i looked at my fork before i put it in my mouth. Otherwise this place would be getting worse then just a bad review.</review>

<text>1st place was very clean and cashier super polite. Asked for combo and substitute the fries and drink for onion rings and shake. Cashier charged me regular price for a full order of O-rings and a shake! On top of that the Frisco burger didn't taste anything like a hamburger! I dont know if it was the seasoning or what but it was not good. The O-rings taste like they are dipped in plain flour with NO seasonings! The shake was really good though...other than the multitude of ice crystals throughout it. Not a good experience.< /text>< Pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>My parents went here this morning  and it was the worst experience ever. The worker was asked if all the ranches were in the bag. The lady said YES. She LIED!!They brought the food home and we were immediately disappointed. 1st they forgot all 6 ranches they paid for.  They charge 50 cents for these things. My sister pulled out a long piece of string/hair/lint thing from her mouth. The thing that makes it worse. There were small baby roaches in the cup holder.  Crawling around the lids.  Can't believe they spent $75 for this BS. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!<//review>< Pictures>

Little bit better quality than your regular Troy's. About the same prices too. Friendly staff and most importantly it looks like they keep they place clean, which is a big plus in my book.< /Text>

<review>My brother had a chicken and he said wasn't that great, I had a hamburger got all the ends of the lettuce, and it was very messy. The fries and drink were the only thing that was good was not worth the $20.00 I paid.

<review>Love it, great customer service and everybody is awesome.  Food is great, you get good servings.  They have a family pack of 4 drinks, burgers and fries.  The club sandwich and onion rings are our favorite. They have a drive-thru that goes quick even when there are a lot of cars in line.  Happy to keep coming here and enjoying a good burger.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Server was rude and had to ask another worker what kind of fish they serve so no knowledge of the menu, my pastrami sandwich was very soggy and I had eaten it literally 3 minutes after being served. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because my order was made fast. As for service, the employees stood in a huddle talking while I stood there waiting to order. I live down the street but won't be returning especially for the price of my food that I could not even finish because of how greasy/soggy it was.<//text>

Mr.J’s had some great tasting burgers. Small little hometown joint you can go enjoy a nice big burger and some fries. They have a variety of items to choose from on the menu. I love these types of places, especially for the ranch!< /review>

< review>
The food is typical, nothing you hadn’t tried. It isn’t anything like In and out or shake shack so if you are a burger enthusiast , this place isn’t anything special. I only had a cheeseburger (it was fairly  big) but the price alone was that of a combo at a McDonald’s (little combo). To conclude , I don’t think I’ll ever come back here if I had the choice . I’m giving a three star due to its name having “burgers” so to me everything else is irrelevant.<//review>

Love the breakfast here and if you ask for extra crispy bacon and hash browns that is exactly what you get. I hate bacon that is not crispy so this is a go to spot for me. Price is reasonable for the amount you get as well, always wind up with extra to take home.< /text>

<text>I've eaten here a few times. The burgers and gyro are okay, but the breakfast sucked.

I saw the cook put burgers on the grill cook one side and put it in a metal container to hold before being cooked all the way through. Lots of flies in the eating area too. I will never eat there again and will tell my family and friends and everyone this once great place is done being decent. You will get sick!</review>

Definitely ,I don't recommend!!! Go somewhere else.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
Always satisfied when I visit this location, great portions with every meal I've had thus far, moderate pricing but not for the inexpensive experience. Even though the prices may be moderate for most, it is still worth the visit and great flavor's and the remodel looks great, kinda of the 50's/60's burger hop atmosphere. Very well done!<//Review>

I usually love this place. I wanted fried chicken, so we decided to come here. I pick up one piece and it had no chicken on it. It didn't look appetizing. The salad didn't look very appetizing either.<//text>

Excellent breakfast burritos (three meat is the best).  This place has great food at a good price, made to order and always fresh, cracking eggs right after you order.  Quick service, in and out in less than 10 min for order for 2-4 items.  Drive thru available, haven't used it, but always see people at it in the mornings.  Overall good place to get the day started!</text>

Excellent breakfast burritos (three meat is the best).  This place has great food at a good price, made to order and always fresh, cracking eggs right after you order.  Quick service, in and out in less than 10 min for order for 2-4 items.  Drive thru available, haven't used it, but always see people at it in the mornings.  Overall good place to get the day started!< /Review>

Unfortunately very disappointing this time around.
I have been coming to this location for over 20 years.
I used to bring my daughter when she was little for beakfast on the weekends. I can still remember when she would place her little hands up ask me to raise her at couter's level to request pancakes and sauges.
Food was always good, however as of late the quality of the service and worse the food has greatly suffered.
Today I ordered a NY stake sandwich, I had not eaten all day long due to a very busy day at work. I was expecting to enjoy the meal. But as I took a bite it not only tasted bad but it smelled disgusting.
I returned it, and was given a partial refund at my suggestion, cause I had eaten half the fries before I tasted the sandwich.<//review>

Been coming here for years, cheeseburgers are good, grilled chicken breast sandwiches are amazing, veggie burgers are delish and my family loves there pastrami.  They have not disappointed me once.< /Review>

<Text>Great place.  A nice (very clean) little diner with a drive thru.  Everything from burgers and fries to fried chicken dinners to delicious Mexican food.  I'm having the other half of my carne asada quesadilla from dinner last night for lunch today... these things are huge!< /Text></record>

<Review>Glad there are back after hearing rumors that five guys were going to open up there . Best burgers in town trust me breakfast better than Redhill biscuits and gravy is hands-down better than anyone in town !!!

I agree you have to wait but it's worth the wait when you get quality good food !!!</Review><GmapID>0x80c34c7b3df40577:0xfba36e353b764d6d<//GmapID>< user>

< Review>
Ok I love this place... hate the fact they didn't bring back the fried mushrooms. One thing that I think about going more often is the tall girl that think that she ownes the place. she is the tallest one there. When u are ordering she cuts u off and doesn't listen. She tries to speed thru everything. She is rude no Customer service. to bad I don't know her name I don't want the other girls getting In trouble because of her. She might be a manager she acts like one. But she was there day and night when it just re-opened. I wish they bring back the fried mushrooms I would go more often even if the service sucks when she is there.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The last salad That I bought this was not bad and the chicken was burned at other times, it was better, but I don't know what happened if they were new cooks but a few months ago it was better.
