The Hawaiian pizza was really good. I would for sure get that again. the pepperoni pizza had cheese over the pepperonis that was kind of odd also couldn't really taste the pepperonis. I wouldn't get the pepperoni pizza again. I would try to get something else. All in all the pizzas are really good. They told me that they called my phone when I asked the lady to read me back my number she just said oh that's wasn't the number and kind of laughed a little, but the laughs wasn't at me it was just her nerves sing like she seemed like she felt bad<//text>

<date>1499565740895</date><rating>5</rating><Review>I have to say the quote on the box said it all. I drove from OC to get this delicious Sicilian pizza. When I got there I had to park in the back which kind of seemed strange. My pizza was still hot and ready to go with the order done perfectly. I even got a chance to show the people at the register my Samsung pay. So glad they were able to use it and let me show them so that they can take more payments that way. The pizza was delicious. I can't wait to go back and get more. One large pizza is about $23 but they do not skimp on quality. I did not take a star away because of parking because that has nothing to do with the owner or the establishment. Keep up the good work< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>3< /rating><text>Love their thick sweet crust pizza with stewed tomatoes!  The best!  Especially with sausage and black olives.  Gave them 3 stars only because the cashier lied to me about the bathrooms availability.  She said they were not working, but I could tell she was lying because she hesitated as she looked back towards the restrooms before she answered me.  A simple, truthful answer like "they are closed because of the pandemic."  But, still, I was a paying customer and not some transient, homeless person wanting to mess up their bathroom.  She could have allowed me to use the bathroom since I was a PAYING CUSTOMER.  Glad I didn't put any money in her tip jar.  Her loss.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

They've got the most scrumptious 1 of a kind sweet crust that really makes it special fresh toppings with the cheese on top of it all</review>< Pictures>

During pick up,  I requested plates and napkins because as I shared with the worker, we were hungry and planning to eat on our long drive home. We had to make a U turn and come back because they didn't include any forks for the salad that was ordered.</Text>

Ate at the one in North Hollywood on victory and Coldwater canyon food was excellent this food was over cooked on fried foods pizza was undercooked with a lazy salad if I could give zero stars that would be too many.

Simply the best pizza ever!    It's certainly not the cheapest pizza in LA, but as I explain in my book Splitting Pennies - inflation is also deterioration of quality, not only increase in prices.  Numero Uno Pizza is as tasty or better than it was 20 years ago.  You really get what you pay for.  Every bite is enjoyable.  We kept an entire Large pizza in a small hotel fridge for several days - reheated in microwave it was even better!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Great pizza, great service! Surprised to see any other review.  Numero Uno Pizza is the best pizza in Los Angeles for 30 years at least I know of, maybe more.  It never fails to amaze in how sweet and juicy, just perfect!  Often I'll drive half way across LA just to get a Numero Uno.  Thanks guys!<//text>

<rating>2</rating><time>1551659091159< /time><text>Whenever I visit Calif. I look forward to having numero Uno's pizza, however, this last visit was a disappointment I always eat at the Wilshire or La Brea stores, this time I tried the one on Hawthorne I believe it was and was greatly disappointed. I asked for mushrooms cheese and tomatoes and could barely see the mushrooms you also had a special after I ordered I wanted to change to get the large for the median price and was told that I had to wait and do it the next time. I will never visit that particular store again!< /text>< Name>

You're lucky if you end up here.  There aren't many left.  There aren't anymore in Orange County.  They used to be all over the place in the 80's.  So what's the big deal?  This is a very unique type of pizza.  The only thing that comes close is BJ's.< /review>

It's a quiet place to relax and have pizza or pasta, maybe a bottle of wine or a pitcher of beer. Very casual and reasonably priced.< /Text>

I couldn't give this place a lower star rating or i would have. I ordered pizza and breadsticks from this place while i was in town. When i ordered i was told 30 mins an HOUR later i called to see where my order was. The lady that answered said oh its on its way...no apologies no discounts nothing. Even after i told her its been more than an hour. When i got my food it was cold and mediocre at best. I threw most of it out. I will never order from this place again. If you're hungry for pizza go some where else you're just wasting your money here!< /review>

Worst pizza ever.. They have the pizzas pre-made and the dough isn't cooked and doesnt rise. This is not your average numero uno. Don't eat here unless you want to ingest uncooked dough. Thankfully they returned my money but that was after they delivered two uncooked pizzas and had me drive the second to the location and had to show them the sticky dough under the toppings.< /review>

All of the staff was wonderful and super helpful! I was in and out with no issues, and had an easy experience of picking out frames! I felt confident being in the office too, with the COVID-19 protocols that they have in place, making sure everything is clean, sanitized, and distanced!<//Text>

Dr. Bass and his team are an excellent examples of what personable and kind customer service look like. I've been going to his Orange office for more than 6 years and they're always willing to go the extra mile. Need a last min appointment change? They'll find a time that works for you, even on a Saturday. Need your glasses tightened, no problem, they'll have it done in 30 min. Always helpful, I highly recommend anyone living in Orange go see Dr. Bass for your vision needs.<//Review>

Dr. Bass is amazing! He listens to me and hears what my concerns are.  He is willing to let me try things that best fit my needs and I never feel rushed in my decision.  I have been seeing him for over 20 years and it feels like family when I am there.  The girls in the front are helpful, kind, and efficient.   Rick is also awesome. Thank you!< /text>

<time>1613778170539</time><rating>5</rating><text>During covid, it's tough to do simple things like going to the eye doctor. Dr. Bass and the staff made it a breeze and an enjoyable experience at that. He was open and honest about my prescription and gave solid advice on changing my contacts to an equal model that would save me money. The associate who helped me with glasses was knowledgeable and gave great advice right out the gate to help me pick great glasses that would hold my high prescription. I was in and out quickly and was pleased with my out of pocket costs.
As someone with a high prescription, I often dread the hubbub of an eye exam, but this was my most pleasant experience in the 20+ years I've been wearing glasses/contacts.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< review>
I’ve been going to Dr Eric Bass for many years & I trust him completely! He’s very professional & personable & very well informed on everything pertaining to your vision. Because I have Fibromyalgia, he has me have a retinal scan to look for changes in my retina that can occur with this chronic disease. His staff is friendly & professional but personable as well. They make you feel very comfortable at your appt! They have a great range of frames to choose from, including sunglasses & contacts. And can & will refer you to a Opthamologist if needed or to one for laser surgery if you are interested and qualify. I’ve never received a bad pair of glasses from them & they are more than willing to adjust your frames at anytime they are open! And they are right next to Starbucks at the Orange office! That’s a plus too! 😄
I’ll keep going to him & would be more than happy to recommend him to everyone!</review>

Dr Bass's office was very professional, helpful and nice.  Dr Bass examined our eyes and talked with us.  We felt like it was a thorough exam.  This was our first time here after going to our previous optometrist for 20 years.  We will definitely be back!</text>

Dr. Bass and his staff are very friendly and helpful, as well as professional.  Dr. Bass is very thorough with the eye exam.  The staff does everything they can to make sure I am happy with my glasses.  They even help me find the frames that are the best fit for my facial structure.  My family has been going there for about 25 years now and we have been very happy with them, and I highly recommend them.</Review>

I love Dr. Bass I have been going to see him for years. He’s very personable and I always feel confident having my eyes checked there. There is a large selection of frames to choose from. The staff is friendly & helpful. I tried LensCrafters once and I was not happy with the service or the product.< /Review>

Dr Bass has ALWAYS given the most thorough care possible and with a smile.  He truly does care.  And the staff are friendly, efficient and always willing to help.  I would and have recommended Dr Bass to family and friends.</review>

Dr, Bass is kind and thorough. He will give you the best price possible and always backs up his frames. I have gone to him for over 10 years!< /Review>

<Review>Always great service, been going there for years. On Friday the arm of my glasses snapped right at the curve behind my ear. I was able to super glue it back on to wear them for the weekend. Walked in Monday morning, picked out new frames and Rick made my glasses for me while I waited (less than 10 minutes).  Feels so amazing to have beautiful new glasses. I've never once had a bad experience, not even today while I got the gals up front to learn how to charge Care Credit :)</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
After moving to Orange and trying to find a new optometrist, I researched and found Dr. Bass. The reviews seemed okay, I called the office to inquire and was informed that the doctor had been there for 26 years. To my surprise, I was examined by a young lady who has been at the office for three months; She checked my prior glasses and wasn't sure if they were regular or progressive. Paid for a worthless exam. VERY UNHAPPY with my visit to this office.</Review>

Great coaches working well with little kids. They're careful about social distance and hand sanitizer.  Kids really improve within 3 months.< /review>

Great staff. Great courts.</Text>

<Text>The courts are in great condition the facility  is we kept. The staff is friendly and helpful.
Evans the best. He's patient, works well with all levels of players,  and manages his staff in a way which is  focused on what's best for the players and reputation of the facility.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Date>

<text>Amazing food!!! We had the lamb gyro and the falafel. They were both insanely good. This spot will not disappoint. The owner was so friendly, he even made smoothie samples for the customers to try! My wife keeps telling me "don't forget to mention the baklava!" It was also amazing! Try this place, it will be your go to spot for all things Mediterranean.</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Excellent food cook with care and attention! Café atmosphere to appeal to many with attentive staff.  Drop by have some baklava and excellent Turkish coffee.  Then you must eat something more from their wealth of menu items.< /Text>

Homemade prices for store bought pita?! What kind of Mediterranean cuts corners and doesn't make their own pita bread?!

Girl at the register was patronizing after THEY forgot to give me food that I paid for.

Very authentic Mediterranean food! The previous owners (once named Petra Deli) retired, and now 2 best friends own it! The staff is friendly and the new menu has a great variety of food that isn't found anywhere else in Stockton! I love the falafel there...and the free wifi😋😝👌<//Review>

Pretty mediocre food; order gyro and was unimpressed; not much meat given, couple pieces of lettuce, barely any sauce; and over priced $10 for a gyro. Yalla Mediterranean 5x better< /Review>

🌺Unfortunately, Baba's is no longer in business at this location.  We are hoping they will come back soon somewhere.
💐We wish them prosperity and joy wherever they are!💐
Yummy!  Baba's has wonderfully fresh foods!  They have super delicious and very healthy meals.  One of the best eateries in town!  They also offer a student discount and are very close (walking distance) to UOP's 🎶 Conservatory of Music 🎶 southeastern corner of the campus.
Baba's is on the northwest corner of Pacific and Alpine.  🍪< /review>

<Review>Great nook on the mile. They serve traditional Mediterranean dishes. I had the gyro and tehbula salad. The tehbula was on point, I don't think it can be improved. The gyro was good as well. The ztyziki sauce was great, but I don't think the meat was cooked on a broiler like how I like, but still worth every dollar.</Review>< date>

This place sucked!  Came a while back, sandwich was made with regular sliced bread, stingy scoop of potato salad,and a sliced pickle served on styrofoam plate...styrofoam!    I'd expect that crap on Charter Way not not the Miracle Mile<//Review>

I found a new favorite spot!!!! Make your own salad at a very great price. Super healthy, colorful and tasty. The girls were very friendly and helpful with the selections. I’m obsessed. Go check them out you’ll be coming back. They also have vegan options</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>The "fresh spring roll" really owns up to its name with the crisp and colorful pickled daikon, carrots and cucumber. Given though, the fresh veggies and vermicelli in a perfectly wrapped rice paper roll wasn't even the best part, it was the PEANUT SAUCE that got me.

The tangy slightly sweet peanut sauce with the peanut crunches really set this experience apart.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRLaIX04JFqsaNT42WDcupETEZk-bsGTdNnLho=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCtB5FHlk6qsZQCQ8qK5a66EHH_p7hbOLAqcZa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

Would have been better with fresher bread, tasted like old bread, which is a shame because the actual ingredients in the bahn mi were superb. Rest of the items ordered were great. The spring roll was bomb, egg rolls are good too. I did like that they are friendly and greet you as you come in. The establishment looked very clean, would like to come to this place whenever the craving kicks in again.</Text>

<Review>Ended up here at random due to the change in hours at another resteraunt. I was extremely appreciative of the open bathroom they had for customers. Ordered a beef bahmi and the beef vermicelli. I enjoyed my food but wish there was a little more meat for the order (vermicello). I found myself still hungry after completing my meal. For the bahmi, I felt bread to be a little stale/hard. Pulling the sandwich apart was difficult. I enjoyed the use of eco friendly packing with paper materials. The interior design is nice and minimalist.  I'm sure it would be a beautiful place to lounge at in the future. I suggest pre-ordering online if you are in a rush. I was here around 1 pm. They were experiencing a late lunch rush but prioritized online orders over customers physically there. Took about 25-30 mins for a to-go walk in order</Review>< resp>

It has that right combo of tasting great while making you feel good too after eating. Right balance of carbs, veggies and meat—all with the amazing flavors of Vietnamese cuisine!! Their chicken and garlic rice is just the perfect mix of flavors and huge portions too. I’d place this up there with Cava as my fav build-your-own bowl type restaurant.<//Review>< Time>

NEW FAVORITE SPOT ALERT.. I came with a large group of friends and we decided there's not a bad thing on this menu.  I had the garlic rice w/ beef along with the fresh spring rolls. My love for that garlic rice is indescribable. But holy cow the beef was marinated with perfection. Will be back again soon. Like, VERY soon.<//text>

NEW FAVORITE SPOT ALERT.. I came with a large group of friends and we decided there's not a bad thing on this menu.  I had the garlic rice w/ beef along with the fresh spring rolls. My love for that garlic rice is indescribable. But holy cow the beef was marinated with perfection. Will be back again soon. Like, VERY soon.< /Text>

<Review>Fresh, fun flavors.  Easily enough to eating a bowl in two batches for thos who love leftovers, but within an hour I was missing it.  I ate the rest of my first bowl same day then went back last night and took my husband to try it. We was finished before I got halfway.  New favorite place.   Sooooooooooo good. Love to support family owned small businesses. Will be back soon!</Review>< Pictures>

The garlic rice with beef is absolutely amazing. You get unlimited toppings (def go for the crispy garlic and crispy onion!!!). The staff is friendly. The place is beautiful indoors and outdoors.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Super easy pickup (ordered via GrubHub). They left the package on a counter right inside the door. I simply had to pick it up and then leave.

Very flavorful and large portions.

Spring roll: 4/5

Chicken bowl with garlic rice (tomatoes, crispy garlic, crispy onion, bean sprouts, sesame seed medley, crushed peanuts): 5/5

Peanut sauce: 5/5
Tamarind vinaigrette: 4/5
Miso sesame: 2/5
My Lai vinaigrette: 5/5< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><time>1597504168139< /time></record>

I was wishing for just one more yummy spot in my beloved neighborhood, and then BAM! My Lai opened up! I've been twice now and find it to be a reliable spot for fresh and fast-casual Vietnamese food. In addition to using fresh produce and vegan protein options, My Lai also has some very tasty pickled toppings like onions and cabbage. They also have a variety of delicious sauces, so make sure you get a sauce or two.The next time I go back, I am going to make sure I get the spicy pickled onions to amp up the spice on whatever I get.<//Text>

<Text>Just tried this place while waiting for my son. It's a nice change for a quick bite that you can customize. Traditional Vietnamese fare with a modern twist. They even have an option for "Impossible meat" that should appeal to those trying to cut out animal protein or want to try something different.

I had a yummy chicken bowl which was pretty good but the star for me was the spring rolls. A large helping of protein (beef,chicken,pork or Impossible meat) with lettuce and pickled vegetables. The sauce for the roll was not as strong as I'm used too but the relatively light flavor complemented the spring roll without overpowering the delightful mix of textures and flavors contained within.

I will be returning here to try their other items in the near future!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Yo this place is maaaad good. Casual vietnamese dining thats clean and healthy, finally! Loved the garlic rice and the chicken. The portions are ENORMOUS! I ate it all and I will definitely take left overs next time lol. Seriously though, prices were very reasonable for the quality and how much you get. 100% will be back to the purple chopsticks!< /review>

Terrible customer service. I was trying to find a place to get my nails done for my bday. I will not however spend my money where there is no respect for the customer. I walked in & immediately was turned off by the interior & lack of nail polish colors & the terrible customer service. I don't mind you being busy, considering only two old nail techs were working, but there is a way to talk to people. I decided to check them out going against others negative take but now I see why.< /Text>

<Date>1568134371415< /Date><rating>1< /rating><Text>I don’t particularly enjoy leaving negative reviews but I just have to with this one. Came here late on a Saturday because my normal place was closed already but I was just desperate to get my gel polish removed, and I just wanted my nails shaped and clear pink polished. When I left my nails were completely uneven and the edges were jagged as hell, the polish was painted on super thick and carelessly, it left bubbles in the polish and there were even strands of lint dried into my nails. The previous polish was also not fully removed. I mean, it was so bad I was laughing after looking at my nails more closely. And to top it all off a few days later I found one of my cuticles became infected. So I can’t say I recommend this place. At least not an hour before closing on a Saturday.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNR0t1pQ-fUoxHs1r3292qp_pcKzXncr0KyDRO7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcW5Oumythag7wuHwsjhjNnNXAJKeb6jUL5fq9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKFUQRxC3YLjq1wBtg0OIAscR7MwxB_ZTL7fQF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAu_iEU2bLN4OCM92Vor0Ah8KlB_j54DV_4L9E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

About 4 people sitting around doing nothing and the woman there told me to come back tomorrow to take my acrylics off. Not to redo my nails, paint them, nothing. Couldn't even take the nails off. Never coming back.</Text>

Where the heck did Lisa go!???  Besides Linda, she was the best nail tech in the shop. Never had my nails done by Mark, but I've seen his work and he's okay, but Lisa was better. I like this spot because there is ample parking and VERY reasonable pricing, but they do need to remodel and get rid of the roaches and the carpet!!! AGAIN, WHERE IS LISA????</Review>

It's just ok because i got gel manicure and the gel was coming off the next day. Went back to have them do it over and they had me sitting too long. I was told to come back when i came back tue lady was on another client. I feel that i should have been accommodated instead of giving me the run around. I won't ever go back.👎👎👎 I work hard for my 💰 and even give tips.<//Review>

<review>I come in mid afternoon to get a fill, I was not given a wait time but I sat anyway..never doing that again. After about 20 minutes,  the man asked if I can come back an hour and a half later.. um wth sir why not give me the wait time when I get there and not when you realize you need to call clients that aren't in yet. If you have appointments lined up DON'T take a walk in without letting them know the time nor let them sit there for minutes!  Worst management ever.</review></record></dataset><record>

The employees can be rude! They like to rush you out once you pay them for there services, some of them don't know how to paint your nails too good!... It's depending on who you get.... Most of their nail polish is old, and they have roaches!!! You may see one crawling on the floor or wall and they don't do anything about it! They act like the roaches are their friends... And if you make an employee mad! They talk about you in there native language it's only obvious....< /text>

Horrible service. Sign says they close at 8. I walked in at 7 and they refused to take me...mind you there was NOBODY in their shop. No customers at all. 4 employees and none of them could take me. They need to say they close at 7 if thats the type of service they are giving out.</Review>

<text>This place is very dirty 🕷🐜🕸and worker's are terrible and they can't speak English and they don't understand what do you want and you have to tell them couple time's until they know what they have to do😔. The price is different from what you see it on the outside on the window 🤑like for example full set is 12$ but when you go inside and they finish the job they say 17$🤔 and you try to understand them why you charging more but they don't understand and you just put the money and trying to get out from the shop🏃 and not get headache 😡🤕< /text>< pics>

I had a great experience with my pedicure and full set. WENDY did a great job on my pedicure; she has magic hands. RYAN did my full set and, did an amazing job. He took time to perfect every step which, is greatly appreciated.  I brought in 2 different pictures of what I thought I would like to try and he created the beautiful nails pictured. A new pink, red and white spin on a French manicure with an edgy, angle on coffin shaped nails. I love how they turned out. I will definitely try more artistic looks in future and, Ryan will be my go to guy.</text>

I walked in and was immediately greeted by a sweet lady, only had to wait a few minutes and then sat down to get my acrylics! Took an hour, very quick and friendly service. The quality is amazing and I love my nails! The photo is taken 2 days after I got them done.< /Text>

The experience was ok. The only reason I came here was because my nail technician was sick. The prices here are normal and the work was decent. I was just really turned off at the end. I gave everyone that worked on me and my daughter a tip. And as I was walking out the door, I was pretty much told my tip for one of the ladies should've been higher since she did my daughter's feet and hands. I was very soured by the experience as it was very unprofessional. I will not be back.</review>

<Text>I was surprised at how large the spa was, and how clean and accommodating they were! Since the shop was so large, they had no problems with social distancing, and they all wore masks.
I had made my appointment by email and they were expecting me. My pedicure was perfect and my technician (and the shop) was quiet,  which I prefer.  I don't drink, but they had a wine bar in the shop.The shop has plenty of parking and is in the Home Depot shopping center in Santee. Oh, and their A/C works great! Jackie was my nail tech.< /Text>< pics>

You get a drink as you sit down for a pedicure so that’s already an amazing start. Loved the massage Ann was firm but gentle. Thank you for the amazing service !</Review>

<Review>I'm only giving Q's a 4 because I got the gel and the color i picked was a pink. Well i can see some spots of my nails were she didn't get it just right, or uneven. Unlike acrylic you see these miss steps. With that being said I still really like my nails and the ladies in the shop are super sweet and I did get a complimentary drink of choice. I will be going back to see Tammy she was awesome and as a plus you get a card that says they will fix your nails for free within the first 10 days if they chip!!!</Review><GmapID>0x80dbfd54dedc9cc7:0xc12150dc76baa5fd< /GmapID>< user_name>

<text>When you pay money for a service, you’d expect for that service to be done and done well, right? I had my eyebrows, lip, chin and nose waxed and I still spent an hour at home tweezing what was left behind even after I went back in a second time asking for a redo. The job was sloppy unfortunately, hair still left everywhere and I am frustrated I am going to have to spend more money somewhere else to get it fixed. Poor waxing experience from me.</text>< UserId.>

<review>Needed to get a full set and pedicure, I am very glad I chose this place. Ryan did my acrylics in an amazing coffin cut and the design is too cute.
I also took my husband with to give him a special pamper day and they took such great care of him with out making him feel awkward for being there.
I will be going back :).</review><GmapID>0x80dbfd54dedc9cc7:0xc12150dc76baa5fd</GmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Went in and they were very nice but my nails just look like hell. I asked for a simple design and it just looks rushed and not clean at all. The place is okay, but I had ants crawling on me. The nails are blocky, crooked, and just isn’t what I expect out of a 4.5 star place. Very disappointed.</review><userid>111997346625251542682< /userid></record>

PHENOMENAL 5 star place!!! I stopped getting my nails done years ago because I could never seem to find a place that was great in every aspect every rarely ever review unless I feel the place goes above and beyond and that’s what this place did. FRIENDLY:Check Exceptional Nails: Check,  Clean Environment: check and they serve you drinks while you relax everything about this place was extraordinary the owner and his wife are also wonderful you have to check it out< /Review>

Love Q’s nails. They have the largest selection of gel colors possible. Everyone is so friendly and they work so hard to make sure you’re completely satisfied. They have a guarantee as well that you just can’t beat. I highly recommend this nail salon. The best in San Diego and East County.<//Review>

Absolutely the best salon in East county!  This is a large nail salon, so they can often accommodate a walk-in. The salon is clean and has a large selection of colours. They offer a complimentary glass of wine, soda, or mimosa if you spend over $25. Love this place!< /Review>

Enjoy a complimentary mimosa or glass of wine while having an amazing pedicure. I also get the dip on nails. They have a 10 day chip guarentee but you won't need it. I have tried other salons and my nails chipped in 3 days. Even toe nail polish chipped at another salon. This salon is very busy but also very well staffed.<//review>

They are open Sundays, which is a big plus for me. I went it for a fill, and it went okay. The lady who did my nails cut my cuticles enough to bleed on three of my fingers. I like the color, and that she went all the way to my cuticle instead of leaving gaps. However, a couple of nails are a little misshapen. They have a lot of employees though, so I will probably return and try someone else.< /Text>

<Text>Jay did a great job in my toes and Z was amazing with my tips! I have been to several nail places in the past and always had a problem with them messing up my nails, but Z was awesome! He got my tips on perfect and just the right length for me! Didn't feel like I had to awkwardly try to understand or talk to him, Z was hilarious and overall the best nail technician I have met thus far. Hands down the best nail place in San Diego! Wine while getting taken care of was an even better perk, I recommend this to everyone!< /Text>< Name>

Ryan did an amazing job with my nails. I am very very picky and very particular on what I want and he was awesome. Emmy did my pedicure and wow what an amazing pedicure I had, she put me to sleep.with the massage. I've been in San Diego 2 years and just moved to east county so reviews are life for me when it comes to hair and nails. I am glad I chose this place. Yes a bit pricey but you pay for what you get here, completely worth it. I will definatly be back.< /Text>

I'm new to San Diego and just went here for the first time. The place is so dirty. All the work stations are badly stained.  The tiny sink next to the pedi chairs has moldy buildup around it. If you look behind the pedi chair, there's months of dust buildup.  They charge $4 extra dollars for the technician to massage your legs. Everywhere I've been, that's included. My technician put lotion on my legs and worked it into my skin. No massage. Had to complain. I wasn't charged.   Overpriced. I won't be returning.< /text>

Not only do you get a free drink with your pedicure, not only are they friendly, lovely people in a very nice new facility; but,,they have a great selection of polish and you get an excellent pedicure or manicure at a reasonable price. I could not recommend this Spa and Nail Bar more highly!!< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I was visiting from out of town and found this wonderful nail spa for a mani/pedi. After picking out my color, Jane offered me a selection of drinks. I chose the Passionfruit Mocktail. It was delicious. Maggie did the most wonderful pedicure. I really loved the warm lotion and massage on my legs. I was very happy to see how they keep the pedicure area clean so I didn't have to worry about catching anything from the last client. I would gladly go back again. I hope to see them next year!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Wife went in for a haircut. We made the appointment ahead of time and a walk-in was still seen first at my wife appointment time. What is the point of making an appointment if your made to wait half an hour after so walk ins can be seen first<//text>

Average wait time. Usually understaffed. Make sure you pay attention to what they're doing and keep the stylist in line with what you really want done.< /Review>

Went back and she fixed it with a semi permanent maroon ish color because I didnt want to sit there for hours again. She did take the time to fix it but it shouldnt need to be fixed...
2nd: went for blue and blonde highlights, completely awful! Half of my head is blue the other half is blonde and it was already after closing so I just couldnt stay longer to get her to fix it.
They raised prices but didnt raise quality of work, disappointed...< /review><rate>1</rate><Name>Elise Holmes< /Name>< user>

I finally came here and got the hair cut I wanted and the hair dressers are super friendly and informative on recommendations on how to do your hair and maintaining it. I will be coming again to have the colorist dye my hair an ombre I'm positive it will turn out great.</Review>< pictures>

I called in advance and signed in. Got there and waited patiently for 10 mins. They said I was next, dude walks in with no apptment and gets a seat before me, smh. That's being disorganized and unfair. They lost out on $. I ain't got time to complain so I just left. I gave them a courtesy call and asked them to delete me off their list. After this experience i am NOT recommending anyone!<//text>

This was my worst experience with super cuts once again. The young lady who cut my hair, Lauren was rude, obnoxious, and very cocky for someone that supposedly knows how to cut hair professionally. I had shown her a picture of how I wanted my hair to be cut and I got the COMPLETE OPPOSITE! She should be fired, terrible service and would not recommend!< /text>

I received great service with my extra bags.  There's no bag check at this station, but they were very helpful getting my excessive baggage onto the train and advising me about getting assistance at my destination station. There's lots of space indoors and outside features a fountain, palm trees ina simple but peaceful space. Great fir social distancing! Loves the tile work inside rhis mission style building.</text>

I'm originally from San Diego and I moved up to LA with my daughter so I started taking the Amtrak just to see how it was the first time in its absolutely the best if you do not want to drive it's about 3 hours from San Diego to LA and it's comfortable it's clean it's got a cafe it's got restrooms need I say more other than there is also beautiful views along the coast give it a try $33 each way<//Text>

<Text>San Diego's Santa fe depot is the best place to start your journey northbound with Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner. The terminal has plenty of seating for everyone.  Amtrak personnel were very friendly and professional.  The trains are all modern with wifi and seat outlets. If you spend a couple of dollars more for business class, you get more leg room and complimentary wine, beer, and other drinks, along with a nice snack pack that's full of 6 or 7 items. Had a great time and the ride was super smooth.<//Text>< Pictures>

Truth in advertising seems to be a big issue with media companies. High speed internet = faster than dial up. By the time it gets to your outlet on the wall, it is as good as dial up in just about any third world country. And how about this crop for an install? Minus the un-attenuated tee, the loss just to the drop in the house has to be enormous. No wonder I keep getting dropped while on line.<//Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Honestly deserve ZERO stars but google won’t let you. Literally we’ve lost internet everyday for a week straight, sometimes it goes out multiple times a day. It’s so bad it’s comical. If you have decent phone service GET A HOT SPOT THROUGH YOUR PHONE COMPANY Don’t fall for this scam of an internet company. You game? Ha good luck. You want to scroll Facebook or watch Netflix? Lol. I feel bad for anyone that has to work from home and rely on this garbage. As soon as a viable internet service comes to Ridgecrest Mediacom will disappear, and I can’t wait for that day.</Text>< Pics>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Terrible service. Each day I start my day from restarting their modem. Probably, it will work after that, but today, for example, I did it 4 times and still have no good connection. But! Each day they charging me. For this terrible internet service and for the modem rental.
There is no more higth speed internet providers in my city. Please, if someone read it from other provider, let me know, I will switch to you asap.
PS: 1 star to customer support at office.
And one star to billing system too - they made overcharge me and even when I saw it by myself didn't wanted to return this money.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeGQ9mc-Qcl7wy0V0gJYX213R7QeWK7d2kwGmi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOB2h4vR1uVPGF2NIA9U0PQURWWO7HFOdXHxjJZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1574199708510, 'text': "Hello Henadz and thank you for the review.

<Text>I would give this company lower stars if I could.  The service technicians are not an issue, I question the values of the company as a whole.  They own a monopoly on our military instillation and are the only source of internet for everyone stationed here.  They use this fact as an excuse to provide substandard service at high pricing.  The internet is not reliable.  Especially during times like these, I have been disconnected and missed several meetings due to my internet service cutting out.  When I look at their website and app, there are no issues listed, yet I have no internet.  The TV in our lounge is a separate account and that is out too.  When I call customer service and report both TV and internet is out, they said there are no reported problems in my area and that I need to reboot my modem.  HUH???  The TV is cable.

If you have an option, do NOT use this company.  Tethering off my phone provides me better and faster service sometimes, and that only costs me $40 a month vice the $99.99 I am paying.< /Text>< date>

<Review>Suppose to have had someone come out on Saturday, just to find out a hour after appointment that the tech was running late but only after calling them. Then hours later gets a call saying do to me being on a military base a contractor couldn't come(I even let the person know when I signed up for the service that we were on the base and wanted to know that they could get on base because I know how it is with these type of things) and I would have to reschedule for the next Wednesday or the supervisor could give me a call to see if someone could come out earlier. Only to have noone call me and then find out today that they didnt even try and schedule me for Wednesday and now I have to wait till Friday.  I only decided to get this because my daughter's needed better internet for virtual school but now I am starting to regret it< /Review>< Pictures>

They are really good I found out my modem was giving out probably due to the increase in use due to my grandchildren doing online school.  I got it diagnosed online and then when they told me I asked if I could just take my modem in and get a replacement which was fine.  I went in on Monday and they were very nice and within a few minutes I was on my way home with the new modem.  The tech that helped me set up wifi was very helpful and very nice.  The process took less than a half and hour it was very easy.  I was very please with the customer service and the tools they have on the website to diagnose problems from home.<//Text>

Absolute worst WiFi connection we’ve ever had!!! It goes out multiple times a day, and stays out for hours! I’m so angry and frustrated at the lack of customer service and the number of times a year we get scammed by them! We pay almost a hundred dollars a month for services we aren’t even receiving! Urgh. I want to report this to the FCC.<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Mediacom extorts an grossly inappropriate fee from their customers and the service still amounts to dial up. They can also randomly drop your internet service despite paying, or even building a credit. Their customer service representatives don't answer any questions and won't even transfer the call. They simply respond with we don't handle that question, go call someone else. Jokes on them, I have tmobile, so I'll be looking into getting cheaper internet through them.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Very disappointed with paying full price with only very little discounts here and there taken off our bill we normally have to call customer service every month because our internet is dragging we've been with them for over a year now and pay almost 300 a month and I am getting ready to lower my service all the way and down to basic tv and 1 gig internet even though one of their techs told me they can't even provide those speeds yet but their sure offering the service and collecting the money for the service how are you not only going to offer a service but charge for a service you can't even provide shame on you I will be looking for a different company< /Review>

Zero stars. I would not recommend this company to anyone. It’s been almost two weeks since I’ve been “online” and have absolutely no service. After about half a week, they realized it was actually a maintenance problem and some wiring needed to be fixed and I was told maintenance will be there Saturday, but no show. On Monday, I called and asked when they’ll be coming around. I was told the maintenance crew has 48-72 business week hours to come by and to expect them by Wednesday. But nothing. So I called them again. And they have no record of maintenance being scheduled. What a surprise. If anyone wants to start a revolution against this company, I’m in. They are useless, worthless.</Review>

The lack of customer care is amazing. Terrible service. Don't care about quality. Don't care about workmanship. If there was a choice, I'd pay three times as much to not have them for the same Internet package. Incrediblely unreliable.< /review>

At first I had countless problems with Mediacom my Internet went down many times per day and I got very low speeds. I called in and told them my problem the rep told me to get a new modem from them however Mediacoms modems are very cheap and needs restarting many times a day so I bought my own. She also arranged a technician to come out and fix the line. A week later a technician arrived on time a fixed the problem in about an hour. I have had flawless internet ever since and am very satisfied with the speeds and reliability.<//Text>

Worst customer service. Before I discovered that I could do bill pay to pay my bill I would just go to their office and pay it. Three times the girl behind the desk shorted me change. The first time I didn't notice until I got home. About $1.50. No big deal. The second time she tried to short me a little over $8. I told her that wasn't the correct change. And the third time I came in with the exact change so I would just be getting a $5 back in change and she tried to short me on that too! So weird. And the dude that works in the office is so miserable and rude if I had to pay my bill and he was there I would just turn around and come back to pay my bill when he wasn't there. Plus our Internet service was horrible. Internet would stop working everyday at 5p.m. and not come back until 8 a.m. the next day just to turn off again at 5 p.m. We would go a weeks sometimes without any service at all. And talking to customer service was a waste because they could never fix the issue. Switched to frontier about a year ago. best decision ever.<//Text>

Definitely unhappy with the service and feel like they need start more compensation for what they aren't providing or fix their issues for their customers.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1583948243380, 'text': 'Hello Pat, thank you for your review and for bringing this to our attention!

This company has terrible service all around. They have terrible internet. You almost never get the speeds that they charge you for. They have terrible customer service. They have long wait times, long service times, their techs are frequently late (I think this is more due to the company not hiring enough than the techs themselves). That being said they are the fastest internet in the area where I am at which is completely horrible. If you have any other company with which to utilize I highly suggest you do. Mediacom is a dumpster fire.<//text>

<Text>Service goes down every time the wind blows.Sometimes for days. They refuse to take calls during this time regarding the issue and almost always blame it on the weather.I had Brighthouse for years with no service interuptions ever.This is just a bad company with bad equipment and even worse customer service.I would give them a zero if I could as they are  the worst provider I have ever used hands down.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Bad service.  Spotty at best.  Obvious lack of maintenance on transmission lines, nodes, and taps, and we the customer pay premium prices (most I've ever paid, worst service I've ever had in 4 states).  And you have to haggle and call them constantly to get any kind of support or refund.  They do not communicate well, and will leave you without service if you don't make a point to constantly remind them of your bad internet connections.  Mediacom, if you want this review to get better, provide better resources to your customer and communicate with them.  Otherwise your rating will continue to be 1.9 out of 5.</text>< gmap_id>

The most frustrating ISP experience I have ever had. Internet constantly dropped out for no reason. I had service technicians at my house every week. They were never willing to fix the problem.

Update: it is a complete lie that Mediacom cares about my experience.  I had service from mediacom in more than one place where I lived, I spent hours on the phone trying to fix the problem only to be told that "we will keep looking into it." Mediacom has it good here in this little town because they are the fastest ISP and they know that no one can compete with them.< /text>

There was some internal issue happening when the tech came to install my brand new out of the box RG. He finally got it working but there was some issue he had hooking it up initially.

Then during the first month having it there have been several service interruptions. After calling I was told I could get a credit for 4 days that they could verify interruption of service.

We've constantly had issues with the quality of connection my router is able to maintain to the DNS, Mediacom. This is a Mediacom issue, nothing on our network could cause the DNS to drop suddenly. Apparently Mediacom has some known issue affecting California and Arizona, so my issues are common.

During viewing Netflix or playing an online game the connection will be completely lost. The DNS disappears which forces me to call Mediacom technical support to which we don't really get a good answer as to what is causing this problem.

However, being an IT guy and having encountered similiar issues with Comcast, I can tell you exactly what the problem is: Their fiber router or bridge, depending upon which they use, is malfunctioning. The signal being routed to our neighborhood is getting interrupted by this malfunctioning hardware.

Meanwhile I still have to pay, which to me seems excessive for dealing with these issues, over $60 a month for internet service.< /text>

Customer service is ok, however the actual service is unreliable. I pay top dollar for internet/cable service and it is sub-par at best. In today's world internet should be at peak performance and it should be CAT 6 compatible. Ridgecrest mediacom is still in the stone ages. I have increased my internet package to 200 Mbs and have seen absolutely no change in data rate or performance, yet they are more than happy to charge me more. Data capping an internet connection is absurd!  I am extremely dissatisfied with the service, however they are the only show in town and can monopolize.<//review>

Essentially a monopoly and like other locations, notoriously terrible. Nonetheless, we got it. At first it only went out maybe once a week for 20 minutes, more or less tolerable considering we are in a windy valley. Ping is normally at 110+. Then it began going out more frequently, often taking the phone line with it. Someone was sent out to replace the modem with a new one and to try to improve circumstances.
This was a mistake. It now is almost unusable, going out for hours at a time multiple times a day. Currently, I'm writing this review on data. It has been out for 3 and a half hours now. I haven't been able to do anything and in this town it's a big deal when you can't use the internet for work or socializing or to even play a simple game. We are paying so much for internet out here.
I implore everyone to switch to something else if possible, even if it'll be about the same, if only to drive home that we will not support Mediacom and they either need to improve service or leave town. I'd also suggest filing with the FCC if you're also having bad outages and to call to have credit paid to your bill for the time you paid for that you were not serviced.< /review>

<Review>Basic Cable and Fast Internet with or without the phone is 138$ per month. I pay for 200mps internet speed and the mediacom speed test never reaches at least 70mps. Like, why am I paying for 200mps when I tested my phone, tested my xbox and internet speed and I only get an average speed of 56mps? This is a huge RIP off!!</Review>< pictures>

Going to give some personal tips here about Media Com.   NEVER just "call" the supervisor if he gives you a business card and tells you to call him if there are any problems.   I thought wow that was really nice of him UNTIL I would call him (WHEN I HAD THEIR CABLE/INTERNET SERVICE) to let him know what was going on and what problems were occurring.  He did respond  or would answer , at first, but later on down the road I wouldn't get called back ,even when I left messages asking him to call and let me know he got my message. THEN when I would call the "Office"  to get "Credit" For the outages, I got told I never called in and there was not much they could do & that I should "report" a problem when it occurred. So needless to say I had no "PROOF" that I had been having a problem/s since no record in their office of my calling it in, when in fact I had been calling and leaving messages with a "Supervisor"   I put up with this for several years.  Finally dropped them and went to Frontier Also after the 1st yr (which they FAIL to tell you when you sign up) The prices go UP ,  Then after you've been with them for 2 yrs-3 yrs they go UP AGAIN !!  My bill for cable and internet was hitting around the $140.00 a month mark. Then I got told that once the 1st yr, and 2 yr contract was up no need for another contract. THAT"S when they get ya !  I couldn't even watch a 1/2 hour Show on cable without my screen on the tv either "Tiling"  "Nothing but Pixels," and if like that for too long, my TV would just "Shut off !!" This went on for well over a year!!. They sent   techs out what seemed like weekly,  Sometimes 2 at a time.  They rewired, ran multi tests, even "Buried" My cable which the orange monster ran across my driveway and part of the yard for 5 WEEKS before they came back to "bury" It.   Whoever or whenever the cable was 1st put in, it was put along the rain gutter and DOWN MY AWNINGS DRAIN PIPE ! so it was pretty much disintegrated and nasty.  One Tech even went out of their way, even to call me on their weekend off to see if things were "working" Which I thought was really nice of them  BUT  since dropping them like a hot potato, we've got bills which has messed up my son's credit with them saying we owe over $300.00 . Equipment and all were turned back in to them and I gave up calling because nothing was ever "Fixed"  on the bill either. They should have paid US for all of the frustration, headaches, and sitting on hold or waiting for techs for days to come out.!  I should have seen the red flag when they first came to install the service over 6 yrs ago. Tech was here for I'd say almost 2 hrs and couldn't get the internet to work.  He was on the phone to someone, tried again then got up , stated he couldn't get it to work and Up & LEFT.  After he left my son fiddled with it ( NEVER HAVING any training in installing, etc) and HE Got it up and running.   I do have issues now and then with Frontier but it sure is  tons better then dealing with what I went through with Media com. PLUS if you have Frontier phone service you may qualify for the income based, "Lifeline" Discount . The Internet is $34.99 normally a month, and if you qualify you can get a  21.00 Lifeline discount . Lifeline decides the credits however Not Frontier.    Not sure if Media com even offers that.  And Media com kept trying to  sell me on getting their phone service. HAHAHA   Couldn't watch a 1/2 hr tv show on cable, internet was  a pain and they think I'd set myself up for a 3rd  problem , phone service. NO WAY   and Please, there's no need for that "Form" Letter response. I see only the name changed under some of these posts (Like they're writing to you personally) Other then that, looks like they are ALL worded exactly the same or close to it !!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1547845382205, 'text': "Hello, I understand the frustration this has caused for you and this isn't the quality of service we want to provide to our customers.

The connection goes out constantly and customer support is non-existant. They charge premium prices for sub-par service and speeds.</Review>

<Text>Surprise surprise, my service is out again and they won't do anything to fix it.  It's amazing how they can employ so many people to call you to try to sell you services, but they can't manage to keep up the services you pay for.  If this town had any other options I would pay for it in a heartbeat.</Text>< pictures>

I should probably add in this review that I've only used the internet (since internet is really all you need now a days instead of internet and cable) service and as a single user with no other users in my home. It's been great. My only complaint is that they are not open on Saturday. I'll be moving that day and it would have been great to drop it off that day instead of going a whole evening without a connection.< /Review>< Pics>

But, they have the worst customer service and the worst connection/speeds I have ever experienced. After calling their help line 6 times and going through their automated system, resetting my modem/router 8 times, and waiting for 1+ day to get internet back we still have no internet. After I called the last time I was placed on the callback "waitlist." About 45 minutes after being put on the "5-10 minute" list I finally got my call from the automated dialer only to sit there waiting for literally anyone to pick up the phone. I gave up 20 minutes later after listening to dead silence and fiddling with my router. Now they're closed tomorrow, I have a midterm that I can't turn in on Sunday becaus the internet is always crashing, I have to explain to my clients that I work online with that I won't be able to check in with them, and no way to talk to a real person on the phone because they closed while I was on hold.... This is about the 7th time I have had this many problems with them and I have finally had enough. This is absolutely the worst internet provider I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with and we pay far too much for this service to constantly have this magnitude of problems. There are oodles of issues that need to be fixed but at least the installation guy was friendly when he installed the modem months ago. I will not recommend this service to anyone and will beg people to stay away from it unless you have time to go to the local office almost every single day to get them to fix the problem.<//Text>< response>

I just got off the phone with Mediacom customer service to find out why the technician never showed up and never called. It seems that the technician reported to his supervisor that he waited for me for one whole hour and he said that nobody was at my home. I explained that I have been sitting here since 7:30 a.m., waiting for him. I even opened my door while I was waiting so that I wouldn't miss him. Now, I fail to see how he could say that I was not home, when I was sitting in front of the open door, waiting. I pay for the highest plan they have---$85 per month.

I have had consistent outages, problems with the hardware(3 replacement routers later) we fixed it ourselves,we have increased the gigs on the data cap and the speed and have seen no performance increase just a raise in our monthly bill. The have the monopoly here in my town, being the only choice. Of course they can afford to offer sub par service at premium prices.</text>

Been with Mediacom on and off over the years and every time it flat out sucks. Can't get good customer service, they are rude and could care less about what happens with you. They know you need the service if you want internet. They are overpriced as well. Our modem stopped working and we bought one from Walmart that works better. Biggest scam ever is that they will charge you for their modem until the end of time even surpassing the worth of it 10 fold. People check your bill, the charge is 7.50 for new/used, it doesn't matter. Stay away from this terrible business.</text>

All I want to do is talk to someone aND request a new modem, but the wait time is more than 15min. Last time I called to report an outage they offered a call back. Before I received my callback I was called for a customer service survey. Of course I told the survey I havnt received customer service yet. My Internet modem must be reset 3 to 4 times a day and is totally annoying. This company offers many ways to pay bills or sign up new service but once you become a customer good luck reporting a problem.< /text>

If I could give no stars I would. I have lost track of the times that I have gone without service. And considering how many things in my home need my internet this is a problem! But honestly my biggest issue is that it is needed for school. My kids can't just say "my internet was out so I couldn't do my homework". Customer service is horrible!!! I have one of the higher plans as well. A tech came out today since my internet isn't working right after switching modems (as directed by Mediacom to upgrade by the 30th). Which cost me $70. Now my internet keeps dropping off which means Netflix stops working or my web browser stops working!! Apparently they were not ready for this upgrade since I am hearing that others are having the problem as well!!! The tech looked at my computer and said you have internet. Then said he was going to do something outside and just left. Seriously!? I had no internet for 2 days and then waited 2 days for him to come. I had to make over 5 calls to the 800 number. One rep was extremely rude and condescending. Finally I went to the local office on my lunch break and he was able to get my modem working. And they have the nerve to ask me if I want to add more services to my plan like cable and phone when my internet is not working. Why, because I am so dazzled by Mediacom's performance so far. Haha!<//Review>

Charged me $120 to "install" when all they did was send out a guy to plug the modem in. He didn't even check to see if the internet worked before he held out his hand for payment and left. Then less than a week later the internet stopped working completely. After 40 minutes of power cycling my router 8 times while on the phone with customer service, I was transferred to a department that was closed and the call ended. I called back and after struggling with customer service for another hour I said the word "cancel" and was instantly hung up on. I went into the office the next day and now I'm waiting another two weeks for a tech to come take a look. Horrible service. I initially recommend mediacom to a coworker, but I will be sure to save him from using their service now. I will go out of my way to recommend people stay away from this horrible company.<//review>

I hated Mediacom for TV, but I was satisfied with the internet. I just opened my bill, and my internet charge went up by 30% without any notice. They added a charge because I don't subscribe to their terrible cable TV service. This charge is unreasonable, and adding it without notice is unacceptable!!!< /Text>

The worst.  They have somehow taken every bad customer service practice out there and made them worse.  Nobody answers the phone, nobody showed up on appointment day to fix the router after a 3 week wait for their next available appointment.  Would love to sit in on their management meetings and laugh at all the MBA nonsense they must be throwing around.  Clowns.  Switching to Indian Wells Valley ISP they answer their phone.<//review>

Tech support is a joke.
Since there are few choices in the area they are "Shooting fish in a barrel".

EDIT.  This is a year later than my first review.  The TV and Phone were out for 13 hours.  It's now 17 hours and the TV is STILL not working...Customer service says "There's an Outage in your area" DUHHH!

Like I said, they're Shooting Fish In A Barrel.  Were there any REAL competition in the area...Mediacom would be out of business.

EDIT EDIT 12/12/2016 9:22 AM PST Ridgecrest, CA.  Its now 33 hours and the television is STILL not fixed!  REALLY?  "We Have Technicians Working The Problem"...I can fix the problem...hire new technicians and fire current management.< /text>< Name>

I was a Mediacom customer for years, and was never satisfied with their outages and terrible service.  I finally dropped them like a bad habit, went to Verizon DSL.  They provided 15 mgs service which was rather good and dependable.  The recently sold out to Frontier Communications, and the DSL service quickly dropped  to 12 mgs for the price I paid before.  Frontier Communications is one company no one should have to work with but in this rural town, it's the only choice unless one wants to return to the lousy service of Mediocrecom Communications Corporations.<//text>

Initially, I had a very bad experience with Mediacom the "Service". Their support was typically onpar with other service providers however (in my opinion all cable service providers have pretty bad customer service, but that's not what this is about), the service seemed to be terrible. The HDTV was pixelated and broken, and the internet connection was constantly going down.
You'll notice I've given 4 stars though and the reason is that the problem WASN'T Mediacom. The problem was the wiring in my home. To make a long story short, I found several problems with the wiring. First was the system was being back-fed into itself creating a loop in the system and introducing a large amount of signal "Noise". Additionally, the unused connections were not properly terminated causing reflection can causing even more noise on the line.
I did the legwork of climbing into the attic and ensured that the drops into each room were properly split (in other words, I have the 1 connection coming from the street and 7 drops throughout the house and a cable modem. I purchased a high quality splitter providing enough ports for all 7 drops and cable modem (8 total out ports, 1 in) I ran an independent cable run to each room where I wanted a cable television drop and one run for the cable modem and I installed terminators on all unused drops (they just screw on and are super cheap for a bag of 10. At the end of the day I was reaching internet speeds at just over the advertised 100Mbps my package included and all HDTV channels were now crystal clear making Mediacom a pretty good service in my opinion. Moral at the end of the story is, before tossing stones at Mediacom, check your own wiring to ensure compatibility.< /Text>

Mediacom customer service is awful. They don't communicate between salesman and technician, they dont give you your account number, they dont tell you that you need to pay for wifi to have wifi (its just cable only otherwise). They set me up with "100 Mbps" but I'm getting 25. Plugging in didn't work, they just didn't configure it correctly. They charged me $125 first day but it did not work well as soon as they left. Oh after every phone call I have with them they ask if I want to receive phone call solicitations. Who does that? Why would anyone want to receive phone call advertisements and why would a company ask you that every time. Anyways.. Terribly company if you can find another ISP you definitely should go with that.<//review>

<Text>Pages won't load, turn off wi fi, pages load instantly, been through multiple routers and modems.  I end up using a good portion of my mobile data, at home, because it's better than my "hi-speed internet" I pay Waaaaayyyyy too much for.  I don't do the turn modem off/on rodeo with customer service anymore, it is completely unreliable, not many options in Ridgecrest, nothing from Verizon or ATT is even available in my part of town.  1 star is 1 too many, the sad part is this has been the case for the entire time I've been a customer, nothing, EVER gets resolved.<//Text>< Pics>

< review>
Mediacom is an absolutely terrible internet service provider. My internet is constantly dropping connectivity. I have contacted them numerous times about getting it fixed and they give you the feeling they care and the "warm fuzzy" that they will fix it but they don't. When I call the "number" (1-800 number is all they have) it sends me to India where I argue with a phone tech telling me "your internet seems to working sir" when it clearly isn't! I've actually had them blame my equipment which is top of the line and brand new.

The only other option for internet here in town is Verizon and they only offer dial-up. Mediacom is owned by someone who branched off from a larger service provider (Times-Warner or something) from another big city (LA or something), then began systematically buying all the internet and cable rights in southern California small towns. They have used this "power" to keep bigger and better companies with broadband out, yet they refuse to upgrade their antiquated system and have even denied some small towns internet service at all!

The cut-rate internet and cable provided by this company is absolutely despicable and the poor service provided puts the cherry on top. I've heard other areas of town have more reliable service but there is seemingly no rhyme or reason to this, it's not like I live in the ghetto!

Mediacom needs to have a lawsuit filed against them for generally being a crappy business. If you're moving here chances are you'll get their service but I guarantee you will hate it. Most people go with Mediacom because they have "faster" speeds than Verizon offers.

If you don't need the "speed" for anything but just normal browsing, go with Verizon. Our neighbors have Verizon and they can even stream and play games on it. You've been warned!</review>

The worst ISP and cable service I have ever used, and that includes the old HBO microwave broadcasts.  It takes field personnel coming to your house to get anything fixed, and they charge you for that even when it's their problem that needs to be fixed.  Large portions of their "network" are poorly installed, resulting in many unannounced outages of service, and even more degradations of service...for instance, audio drop-outs happen several times an hour on many cable channels, and digital channels regularly pixelate out, sometimes for hours at a time until someone fixes the damaged piece of equipment. And if I were someone buying commercials from them? Commercials run back to back, and for months with damaged audio and video that's distorted or out of synch.  There is no volume attenuation from channel to channel, with some being too quiet to hear late at night while others are so loud the neighbors can hear them, let alone the other people in the house sleeping. They charge $10 a month for a crappy router prone to overheating-in the middle of a desert-a modem/router that you could buy at a Best Buy or Fry's Electronics for $29. This company needs to be bought out and gutted from top to bottom.</Text>

<text>My husband has been here lots of times while traveling for business but this was my first time. They serve wonderfully fresh and delicious fish in a very traditional atmosphere that is lovely. We eat a lot of sushi and sashimi and really appreciate how fresh and beautiful their fish is. I cannot wait to return. I’m not sure what the unfavorable reviews are but suspect people may want a flashier place but this restaurant isn’t about that. It’s about quality and serving beautiful food.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Indoor dining!  Some of the best Japanese food I have ever had.  Great location.  Someday when the cable cars are running again 😥 they will go right by.  Very reasonable prices.  Large portions.  Great lunch special.  Great wine list which can be uncommon in a Japanese restaurant for some reason.  Friendly and efficient staff.  My new go to!< /review>< rate>

I got the katsu don and it was regretful. I dont want to post a photo because its not as appetizing as the taste. They pkged it with egg omelette on the top of the chicken katsu which made the chicken and breading soggy af. The egg was like not fresh and spongy. I threw everything away. So disappointing.< /Text>

<GmapID>0x8085808e9e1a51db:0xd486e0adbedd707d< /GmapID><Review>3 stars because of the front desk lady.
She is very rude, literally from on the phone to off. You call to order and she hangs up immediately after you stop talking, doesn’t give a price, doesn’t ask for your name, doesn’t confirm order or anything.

I ordered fried sushi it was good but the service from this lady who answers the phone is ridiculous.

They got my order correct and she I sited it was my fault, when if she would have confirmed my order she would have known what I ordered.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Fantastic sushi at this rather dim lit, no frills, yet authentic Japanese decor Sushi Bar. Located right off of Union Square in San Francisco, with late hours, it is a great option when downtown. Extremely fresh seafood with a unique menu of fusion rolls, served by a friendly staff and very reasonable prices; this place is a definite winner among the zillions of sushi bars in SF.

Oysters and wakame were simply delicious, tempura rolls served at proper temperature, great flav profiles. 👍🏽

Would highly recommend.< /Review>

Fish tasted fresh. Actually had some nice raw fish rolls. Loved the cherry blossom and sake mango rolls. Decent saki list and some interesting sushi options in their daily specials. Prices were descent for SF. My rolls were $15. I would go back.</review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>To start, the price is great. Its surprisingly affordable for the area of town it's in. The food is good, and the service is attentive. I started with mixed tempura, which was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Next was chicken teriyaki, which was good, but the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I felt like the sauce was solid but not great, and I would have liked to see more vegetables worked in. That said, great meal, and well presented.< /Text>< pics>

I have this sushi resturaunt in my "top favorites of all time" category. It's really fresh, the service is great and staff is friendly and accommodating. The only complaint-type of concern I could give if I had to: is for staff to label the food packaging so that the customer can identify what they're eating. My man has a food allergy which made guess work a challenge when it came to seeing that his order wasn't contaminated with the allergen. We ordered the Volcano roll(my fav of favs), Yummy yummy roll, Powell roll, Bay scallop roll, Spicy scallop handroll, Jalepeño bomb, LaBamba roll (least fav of all the favs), Nameko soup, and Tonkatsu Ramen. And a last minute addition to the other for one of my kids was Chicken Karaage. We are sushi fanatics but have been obsessing over these baked rolls lately and mayyyybe overindulging but im happy when I eat sushi- so sue me. This place is worth returning to and definitely on my recommendations list as an accomplished reviewer.;P
Btw, apologies for having no food left to take pictures for you all to drool over but I will update and include next time because there will be a next time♡+.</review>

Sushi was really good but expensive. The platter below costs 30 USD. This however, isn't why I chose to rate this Japanese restaurant two stars. A friend of mine, who ordered the beef teriyaki and a california roll was treated like garbage. His beef was very chewy. Not a problem, can happen. Everyone makes mistakes. Also his california roll was forgotten. Another friend also didn't get all of his orders. But when made notice to the very unfriendly waitress of these unpleasant issues, she just kind of turned us away and basically said we we're making a scene out of nothing. That is not how a host treats his customers.

So waitress, if you're reading this. You and your restaurant suck</Text>

<text>Not such a good experience. Food was nothing special. About the service, after ordering several items for myself, we started our meal with the initial items served. While waiting for the last of what I had ordered, I asked who appeared to be the owner or manager about when my final dish was coming. She went back to ask our waiter about it; she came back to tell me that I did not order that. Really? I didn’t order what I know I ordered and what my company heard me order, especially since we discussed that I’d order that very thing?!?Writing this, I’d originally had it 3 stars. Dropping to 2 since I realize that interaction was insulting. There could have been an apology that maybe she just didn’t hear me; but it was nothing like that. It was a simple “she said you didn’t order that.”<//text><Resp>None<//Resp><rate>2< /rate><gmap_id>0x8085808e9e1a51db:0xd486e0adbedd707d<//gmap_id>< Time>

Normally it would come from the Fort Bragg area but this was sourced in Alaska due to waves in NoCal that stopped divers. Presentation here is simple but the quality is very good.< /Text>< Pictures>

Good Japanese little place, the fish always taste and look so fresh. I feel they really put love in their food, usually go for lunch when Im working, could be a bit busy but once you get your order you forget about the little wait, at nights its perfect for date night or a casual dinner with friends. Simply really GOOD.<//review>

Sushi was okay - not the greatest that I’ve ever had, but they did offer a decent selection of speciality rolls.  The Lunch Bento was given to us around 3pm which was helpful.  The service was very quick and attentive!<//text>

Maru was excellent! The sushi chef was easy to talk to and very helpful when ordering. The food was too notch. Honestly this was some of the best sushi I have ever had and it came and went very quickly! If I'm ever back in the area, I would not hesitate to come back to Maru Sushi.<//text>

<Name>Jordan Mccormick</Name><text>Stopped in for late lunch for 1 when in town for business.  Wasn’t the most amazing experience, but certainly did the trick.

Service was immediately and friendly.  Menu had all that I was looking for and prices were reasonable. Was slow when I arrived, this made dishes come out super quick.

Would certainly come back, if wanting sushi lunch. Not suitable if wanting to impress clients or for special occasion dinner.<//text>< GmapID>

The food was great.  Service was good.  The nigiri proves were a little high.  $20 for uni seems a bit steep, but it was the same price as Otoro which seemed a little odd.  I initially went there because I saw salmon and tuna donburri for around 12 bucks.  At the restaurant I found out they don't have those and the closest thing was the chirashi don.  It was good but was around $26.  A little misleading.  Bottom line, it was good and the people and atmosphere were what you'd expect at a sushi joint in SFO.  I recommend this place.<//Text>

< review>
Went here on a Tuesday night. Restaurant was about half full, not busy. Waitress was new, but fast and attentive. Fish quality was good and tasted fresh. Prices are on par with SF. Did not encounter any of the long wait times for food and bev like others have commented in other reviews.< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Good food, but extremely long wait time for food to be served. I’ve never waited this long in any restaurant.

<Review>It was seeming a good family-run restaurant. Tables and restrooms are just clean.

I ate a Lion King sushi and drunk a cup of Matcha tea.

Also I believe they have one of the healtiest menu in this area..</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>Reviews look good. I am not a picky eater. Tuna fillet on top had lots of connective tissue attached to it, and had no texture. Poor quality tuna that day. It was kind of like having extremely soft mashed potatoes in your mouth. I had one bite of my roll and asked for my check. Ended up having to pay $23 for my. I think they should have at least taken the roll off my bill. Gave two stars instead of one because it was quick service.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Overrated. The prices are super steep for what you get. Ordered the 6 sushi and 6 sashimi for $30 and both things were super dry and stale. This inevitably added to the lack of flavour too. The service leaves so much to be desired. The staff are rushing to remove plates from your table and threw the bill on the table before we had even finished our dinner. The service varies per table. I wouldn’t come here again. I’d just go Super Duper burger instead.< /text>< name>

<review>Three item bento box was HUGE! Tempura and chicken teriyaki was great. Sashimi was small and would probably pick something else if I could do it again. But overall great value for money. I went here a little past 11 for lunch and it was me and another table. Not crowded at all and food was out quickly.<//review></record>

< Review>
Terribly slow service and everyone does not receive nearly the same level of service. This took away from the experience greatly! The food was actually good...once we got it.

We came here on a Sunday around 3pm; they weren’t too busy as far as traffic as only about half of the restaurant was occupied, maybe less.
There were at least 3 other parties; 2 parties of 2, and a party of 1 that came after us that received quicker service. I’m talking about they had their full meals and were leaving by the time we received our entrees.

Our waitress did warn us that there was only one sushi chef working that day so the rolls would take a bit longer; understood. We ordered 1 sushi roll; just one! However, we watched people who had came in after us receive their rolls from the sushi bar and we were sitting right in front of the chef, so we knew when he called out each table number that was ready.

Our miso soup came 10 minutes apart from each other, so I watched my coworker finish hers and waited for mine. No kidding when I say we waited another 30 minutes just to get our salads! When we finally got our entrees a party of 4 had come in and sat next to us. We watched as they were checked on often and received their appetizers in a very timely manner. And would you believe they received 2 sushi rolls from the sushi bar and then our 1 roll came right after they received theirs and we finished our entrees!

They clearly did not think we were important enough to check on and receive our food according to a queue. I have my thoughts on why WE weren’t prioritized, but I’ve shared enough on our experience. My coworker and I won’t be returning.< /Review>

Really mediocre sushi for premium prices. Sushi was a bit tough and the portions were kind of small.

For a table of four, our order arrived one-by-one over the course of 30 minutes. Half of the table was finished before one person received their order. The last person to receive their order had to eat with everyone else finished.

There is no way I'd visit this place twice.<//Text>

<Review>I stopped in 15 minutes before close, ordered one maki roll to go. The roll was great. Although the shrimp tempura tail sticking out the ends of the roll was excessively long, lol.

Fresh, good sushi.  Not the most imaginative rolls or anything, but the three different kinds of toro they had this evening more than made up for it.  The oysters were also yummy and fresh.< /Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>A great sushi spot just a brief walk away from Union square. The prices are fair even for the touristy area that it is in and service is good too though can be a little slow at peak hours. The sushi selection is standard and of good quality. They have other Japanese basics on the menu too. Overall a nice place for a family dinner or even an informal catch up as you watch tourists and  the cable car jingle by outside ...</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Service seemed a bit slow compared to my favorite place back home, but the toro tuna and salmon were worth the wait. The Alaskan king crab roll didn't hurt the situation either. Sushi nigiri portions were definitely of decent size. Tuna , salmon, mackerel, butter fish and of course the toro pieces were all good quality.< /Text>

Spent there 15 minutes to see the server, than another 30(!!!) to get my order, well, part of it - they missed on appetizer and soups, but surely didn’t forget to include them in the check. Not to mention everything was served barely warm.
I can understand it was a busy day but waiting 40 min to get a glass of water is ridiculous.<//text>

This place is actually the best.  We came on a saturday, typically the day to avoid sushi based on delivery typicals for fresh fish to the city, but let the old wives tales be debunked.  Albacore 2 piece - amazing, hamachi toro - amazing, and salmon skin handroll, well, never had better!  And I grew up in hawaii, have been to Japan, and have been to what LA and SF claim are the best places.  We also left with a tab well under 100 after getting so full we needed wheelbarrows and got a few beers and sake to add.  Would recommend to anyone.  Sit at the sushi bar, but honestly service is good enough you can sit anywhere and have a good time<//text>

I dropped into Maru as I was walking up Powell St and thought it looked like a nice place. The decor is clean and there's a nice atmosphere.

I was greeted warmly by the staff and seated at the sushi bar where I made conversation with one of the chefs.

Once my sushi was prepared the chef handed it to me over the counter. I have to say I was blown away by the quality. The sushi was beautifully made, and the fish tasted very fresh, unlike some other places I've been.

Fantastic experience with the food, I just wish the service had been more attentive, but it was quite busy and there were some large tables so I'll forgive them.< /text>

Good food, okay service, bad maintenance. The sushi was good, but the oysters were a little sour. The waitress was nice, and we got the food a little while after we ordered. The tables were sticky, causing some glasses to spill when you try to pick them up. Overall a good experience. Only thing that could be improved is cleaning.</Review>

<Review>Love their "Brandon" sushi rolls. I also like that they let me switch brown rice in place of white. Great portion, fairly priced, vast selection and oh so yummy sushi! My only Regret is that I live in  San Francisco,and this place is really out of the way.<//Review>< Pics>

Service is fine. Pricing is comparable to area. Table was dirty. I ordered Sashimi having enjoyed it so often in London. It was terrible. I was then informed I was mistaken, as it had been delivered that morning. I was refused a refund and was dealt with contempt. My friends enjoyed their food. I suggest you walk on as, should you not enjoy your meal, you risk being scorned by an unreasonable and aggressive host.< /Text>

< Review>
We were staying close by for 10 days in The City and ate here three times. We were delighted each time by reasonably priced sushi and sashimi, and as I am a vegetarian I was very happy to find a good (if not extensive) selection of California Rolls and other dishes which contained no fish. Highly recommended.< /Review>

I was surprised how much I ended up liking this place! Was passing by it after an evening stroll along union square and thought I grab a quick bite to eat. Not normally the biggest fan of sushi (I find it often a little too bland and mild for my liking), but found the dishes served here to be quite tasty and flavourful. Staff were really friendly and the overall establishment very pleasant.< /text>

<Text>Considering it's proximity to the tourist traps by Union Square, it's really good. Very fresh fish, nicely presented specialty rolls. I was pleasantly surprised, and will be back.<//Text>< resp>

Fresh Japanese food at a good price point! My favorite here is the La Bamba roll. They also have some good vegetarian options.</text>

< Review>
Tourists who brave the hillsides of the Union Square vicinity will be rewarded by this Japanese eatery. The interior is reminiscent of a traditional sushi restaurant in Japan, and there's plenty to choose from the offerings of sushi, bento and dinner items. Sit at the bar to watch the sushi chefs skillfully prepare your sushi, or grab a booth for a more private setting.< /Review>

Nice place, nice sushi. It didn't impress myself though and I think there are better sushi places in San Francisco. Nonetheless it is a good place to eat, the staff is friendly and it is not overpriced. I would definitely come again.<//Text>

Poor service. We sat at the table nearly 15 minutes before they even came to the table. And then they didn't bring water until we requested it. Later in the meal when I ask for a refill of my water she said she would bring it back and walked away. She didn't come back I had to ask another waitress to refill my water< /text>

After the first disappointing visit i thought i would give them another chance. Bad mistake. The sushi/ sashimi here is old and dry, dull and dreary. The venue certainly looks the goods with lords of red lanterns and timber but don't be fooled, the guy chopping at the raw fish with a chef's knife is no talented expert and the lack - lustre meat he fumbles onto the plate wouldn't qualify as sushi grade in most countries. Do yourself a huge favor and walk 20 metres up the hill, turn left and eat at Toni Sushi like the locals - they know...</review>

< Review>
Lively, decent decor place. Way overpriced sashimi. It's already $2.66 per piece, and they wanted to scam me with a $4 surcharge for all salmon -- the cheapest fish out of the usual tuna, hamachi. Almost no sushi place globally does that, definitely not in the Bay Area where I frequent lots of sushi places.
There's another place literally 200 feet away, and they're not scammin' for salmon.<//Review>

<review>The owner is korean! one of the chef is mexican! but they still got very good sushi!! I come here at least 3 times a month! We always order our favorite Lover Spoons $11 for each spoon, sashimi or nigiri, edamame and miso soup is good here, hamachi kama or Saba (grilled mackerels) is excellent and sometime we also order the uni nigiri ($18) which has never disappoints!!

I've been here a couple of times for lunch. They have some combinations which are nice since you get a few different things. The sushi here is not that great and I think the quality is lower than the prices indicate. Sanraku and Akiko's are nearby and offer much better quality sushi in around the same price range.<//Review>

This place has a great atmosphere.
Since I'm not really a fan of sushi, I had the Yaki Udon, and it was the best udon I have ever had.
Staff was really friendly and prices were reasonable.</review>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>The 5 star reviews on here must be from people who have never had sushi.

First of all, it took 20 minutes after sitting down to even get a wait-staff's attention to take our order. Even after we told the waitress we were ready to order, she STILL didn't take our order.

Then we were served a miso soup and salad. 1, for two people. Since many restaurants serve these with rolls, we asked if we should have gotten 2 of each. Instead, the waitress took the food (that had been there for a good 4 minutes without any supervision!) off of our table and served it to the table next to us!!! What!? That is definitely not up to any code. Ugh.

Then we received two rolls. They were both... Fine. One was one of the acclaimed "baked" rolls that got positive reviews on here. They were tasteless at best, bad tasting in some bites. I asked for no tobiko and got rolls with tobiko. We ordered edamame and literally didn't get it. When we mentioned that when we got the bill, the waitress brought it - as if we wanted it then?! The third too we got was slightly better than fine - it has scallops on it (not baked) - which warmed this review one extra star.

There are plenty of sushi restaurants around the area. I would suggest you go to a different one.</Text>< Pics>

<text>BEWARE! The prices listed on Google Maps' menu section are NOT accurate. This restaurant is much more expensive than listed here (e.g. Gyoza are $8, not $3.75). Other than the bait-and-switch with prices, it is a decent sushi place.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

TL;DR - Ripped off, poor service, lied to, awful food :(

My boyfriend and I visited the restaurant after looking up the menus online, and we checked the menus outside the restaurant on Thanksgiving Day (it was closed for the holiday). The menus posted outside and online were the same. When we visited the restaurant the next day the menus seemed to be different, so I asked the waitress if they had changed their menus. She told us that nothing had changed, but asked me to show the menu I had seen online. When I showed it to her, she immediately broke into a loud outburst (which every nearby table could overhear) telling me that there was no way the restaurant could continue serving fish at such a price. That doesn't bother me - we're happy to order off the updated menus, but she didn't need to make such a scene.

We ordered 1 order (2 pieces each) of toro, maguro, halibut, and uni. The halibut and uni were listed as market price, while the toro and maguro were around $6.50 - $7.00 each. Then, we ordered 6 pcs. of oysters (around $14.00) and one order of ebi tempura ($8.50).
- Ebi tempura: only 3 pieces for $8.50? Nothing was of epic high quality, so we didn't appreciate the portion size. This seemed too high for some simple tempura.
- 6 pc. oysters: they served it to us at the end of the meal when the ice bed under the oysters had already melted. This means that they had waited for quite a while before serving us the oysters. The (tiny) oysters were drowning in an overpowering, acidic sauce. I didn't even want to finish the order.
- The sushi was bad, too. The quality of the fish did NOT seem exceptional or even average. It was under-average. The uni was especially bad. We felt sick all day after eating it. The waitress had advertised the uni and halibut as being especially fresh and highly recommended we order it.

Aside from the sub-par food, the worst part of our experience was what happened when we got our bill. It was around $85 (up to $90+ with tip) for 8 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of shrimp tempura, and 6 tiny oysters. This is ridiculous. When we asked for our itemized receipt, we noticed that the halibut and uni had been listed as $20 EACH. This is $20 for 2 PIECES of sushi while the other sushi prices were nowhere close. We have previously dined at highly rated sushi restaurants in other parts of Canada and the US, and this price (for sushi) was even beyond what we paid at luxurious, high-end sushi restaurants. We don't mind spending the money for quality, we love sushi! We asked our waitress what happened with the bill, and she went on another rampage, talking about the shortage of fish in the USA and the high price of toro and how hard it was to catch fish. Umm.... if that's really the case, then why haven't the prices at the other restaurants risen so high? She kept arguing without listening to what we had to say - we never raised our voices or said anything rude, and politely tried to explain our confusion. She wouldn't listen and didn't budge.

I didn't really want to write such a negative review - I know that restaurants struggle, and that business is hard - but we would have appreciated more courtesy and transparency, as well as more honesty from the waitress.

Specific requests for the restaurant:
- Update your online menus.
- Be transparent about how much "market price" means. If a guest orders something that is listed as "market price", it is common courtesy to inform them of the price.
- Don't complain about how hard it is to catch fish when someone is confused about their bill.< /Text>

The best food they have to offer is the Nabeyaki Udon during lunch or the bento box special (2-3 items + salad, soup, and rice). Everything else they have is too pricey for any casual meal.

The waitstaff is nice and free fast wi-fi is available, perfect for a quick upscale lunch.

AVOID THEIR RAMEN AT ALL COSTS< /text>

They went and took our orders for food and I told her my order and she looked right at me and was standing right next to me. We ended up getting a different waitress cuz the other one couldn't handle it I guess. She was forgetting who had what and forgot some of our salads and soup. They had organization and memorization problems. My aunt ordered shrimp tempura but the gave her just the tempura instead which is a different order. She had to take it back but when they came with the bill they charged us for it. They overcharged us. I had to wait 3 hours for my food because the waitress said I didnt order when I clearly did but whatever. She was still going to charge me for the food though, but I found a bug in swimming in it. So after 3 hours of waiting I get a bug in my food. They went and made my food free and gave us icecream in componsation, but they should have gave us a discount. Worst place ever.</Text><Name>Cloudy Wolfy< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Sushi range was good overall and freshly made. However, the tonkotsu ramen was probably the worst I have had in years, avoid.

Free Wi-Fi is good for visitors, use VPN over it ;-)<//text>

Visited this restaurant 12 times over a span of 3 weeks on a business trip.
Although two Japanese restaurants were just a stone's throw to where I was staying (Nikko), I kept going back to this Korean-ran restaurant.

Why?
Friendly staff, and more importantly, consistently high food quality.
Dojima Ann (same value comparison) OTOH, had great location but wasn't consistent - slices of sashimi were quartered when it was busy.

The items that I had, by frequency -
* Chirashi
* Sashimi Combo Deluxe< /Text>

fish tasted old, waitress didnt couldn't even tell me what was in the dish, and meal came 20 mins after the meal of my friend arrived (even though the restaurant was close to empty). Never again!!!<//Review>

The service was very unwelcoming, treated like ghosts, one order was taken wrongly. Not recommended.< /Text>

Average restaurant, looked like the waiters were busy but no idea with what since there weren't too many people there when we arrived. Took a while before our food was served and was still pretty pricey.< /review>

<text>(Translated by Google) It's delicious here. I stayed at a nearby hotel, so I packed it and ate it, but it was so delicious, so I packed the same thing again. What we ate was Sushi Deluxe, and there were 8 pieces of sushi and 6 rolls, but the seasoned rice was just right, the seaweed was so delicious, and the sashimi was thick. The kind was not special, but the quality was good. The boss ran it with pride. It's been a long time since I ate delicious sushi and rolls. If you live around here, I think you will come often. I added 2 pieces of salmon separately.

여기 맛있어요. 주변 호텔에서 묵어 가까운 곳이라 포장해와서 먹었는데 넘맛있어서 똑같은거 또 포장해왔어요. 저희가먹은건 스시디럭스였고 다양한스시 8피스와 롤6개가 나오는데 밥에 간이 딱맞고 김이 너무 맛있고 회도 두툼해요. 종류가 특별한 회는 아니었는데 퀄리티 좋았어요. 사장님이 자부심갖고 운영하시더라고요. 오랜만에 맛있는 스시랑 롤 먹었네요. 여기 주변 산다면 종종 올 것 같아요. 연어2피스는 따로 추가한거에요.</text>< Time>

(Translated by Google) Very good sushi especially without being too loaded with rice without any poisons as could happen, but here it is well balanced and fresh.

Average Japanese restaurant although the food is good.
Service rather average.
I recommend for people who like to discover the secrets of the city.

Sashimi line is good. It's more than halfway.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The restaurant is quite spacious but a bit noisy.
The waitresses are not smiling, however they are attentive to the slightest need.
We had 2 pasta dishes of a reasonable amount. However, the prices are too expensive !!
In addition to that, we were forced to adjust the tip when we did not want to do it.

(Original)
Le restaurant à assez spacieux mais un peu bruyant.
Les serveuses sont peu souriantes toutefois elles sont à l'écoute du moindre besoin.
Nous avons pris 2 plats de pâtes d'une quantité raisonnable. Cependant, les prix sont trop cher !!
En plus de ça, on nous a forcé à régler le tip alors qu'on ne voulait pas le faire.</Review>
