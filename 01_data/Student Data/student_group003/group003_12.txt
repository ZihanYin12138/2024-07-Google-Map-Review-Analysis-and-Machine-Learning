Update 4/14/2021
This time the attention was much better, the waitress was very nice and kind even she was the only one for the whole restaurant.
Fast food, delicious, well proportioned. 👌🏻🥰

Update 8/8/20
I am very disappointed by the attitude of the waitress from the beginning, I do not know if it bothered her that my partner does not speak Spanish or I dont know, but she was very rude, got the drinks wrong and she got upset, she didn't like that we didn't order fast. We'll see how the next one is.</Review>

<Review>Bad service, I  placed an order to go and they didn't write it down correctly. I called them back to order what was missing and they kept making mistakes. Second time I got charged for it, but they gave me an incomplete order. So be careful with this lady that don't check the order good before they give it to you. It's a waste of time to go back when the happens.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc742f0268d953:0x25b9ae2ee6ea13f8< /Gmap_id><Rate>1< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

Nice place to have a meal atmosphere substandard but friendly clientele very local buckets of beer, mariachi bands on the weekend Place does fill up. One of the best salsa bars and chips are always on hit, best known for their Seafood. But the carne asada or Carnitas burritos are big I enjoy this place.</Text>

Never be disappointed! This is authentic as it gets when it comes to Mexican food at its finest! Great service and very affordable. Try the Notorinous plate a hot peppers colorful yellow sauce with shrimp sauce that will leave your mouth dripping with savory spicy feeling.  of course you have to have the Ice Cold Modelo especial to put out the flames.... I love it!!!< /text>

<Time>1484626070630<//Time><review>Went here for a late lunch. A little after we were seated we nicely asked our server if they could turn the music down a little...it was So loud (we were the only customers so I didn't think this would be a problem). They refused to turn it down and instead one of the guys from the back walked over to the stereo system and turned it UP, looked over at us and pumped his fist as if to say 'I like my music loud and too bad if you don't!' I questioned our waitress, who was very nice, and asked her why they weren't able to turn it down? I said it's not that I don't like the Mexican music, it was just that I had a bad headache and only wanted to enjoy my meal. She said 'sorry, there's nothing I can do'. So even though we had already placed our order we decided to leave. We offered to pay for our chips and apologized to the waitress for having to leave. As we were walking out the door I heard the guy for the back yelled 'see ya!'  Like he was proud for making us leave.  We're Caucasian and I'd hate to think it was a race thing but I did see another review that felt the same way. Too bad.</review><rate>1< /rate>< pics>

<Review>Terrible experience. Food was under prepared and undercooked. I ordered a shrimp burrito and when I cut it open, I immediately find 3 shrimp that are still not peeled, like these people are trying to have a lawsuit. It took them about 90 minutes to get the food and when I did get it, it was warm, not hot. It was warm like it had been sitting for a while. The lady that was singing forgot some of the lyrics and just stood there in shock. The live band also was bad and made my stomach turn even more. I couldn't even finish the burrito, I was so disgusted. When I got home I had the runs. Later in the night I threw up so much. I wouldn't curse anyone to go to this place ever. No one deserves this kind of torture.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc742f0268d953:0x25b9ae2ee6ea13f8< /Gmap_id></record>

<time>1522972574041</time><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>The price was typical ($9-21) per person for a dish. However, the restaurant was very unsanitary, the waiter boxed unfinished food by directly touching the contents and moving into the box without utensils. The toilet seat had footprints on it. Although I wanted to post about the food I could not because of how uncomfortable the restaurant made me feel. The food on its own merit was unenjoyable as much of the flavor was very plain and some tastes were so overpowering that natural taste of the food was gone. I can only say I was very disappointed by the care of the staff placed on the restaurant and the food. I am giving two stars because what I ordered was edible but was almost terrible.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>I enjoyed eating at this grub spot with my family. Everything was tasting delicious! They sell beer there too. You can watch the partidos here any major sporting event is happening here. They also have love bands that play on Fridays. You can hang out with friends and just drink $1 Coronitas. They even have beer specials here. Back to the food my fajitas were great, the mojarra frita Tilapia was great. So was the bean and cheese burrito. The drinks were good the salsa bar had a great variety of good tasting salsas.< /Text>< name>

Wow! Amazing food and fantastic live music. The molcajete campechano was amazing. Fresh seafood and friendly staff. Also great salsa bar! One of our favorite Mexican/seafood restaurants! Bacon wrapped shrimp, aguachiles verdes, and green enchiladas are just a few of our favorites. And you MUST try the michelada. DELICIOUS! Also you must come here if it's your birthday. They have a beer bong and they will get you drunk af haha!<//review>

I've been going for years, but the last time the shredded beef tasted and smelled like chemicals. The waitress knows Me so We didn't eat the beef and She didn't charge us for the meal.<//text>

Solid food and decent atmosphere. Service was kinda slow and the salsa lacked some kick. But otherwise was decent.< /text>

<Review>We just left this place and I am disgusted. I found three hairs in my food while we were eating. We told them as soon as I had to leave because I thought I was going to gag. They kept insisting to my husband we should have told them when it happened, when in fact we did. Y'all should look at your security footage from this morning. This was an extremely dissatisfying experience especially for two people who had never been there and your customer service is absolutely terrible.< /Review>< pics>

<response>None</response><user_name>Raul Hernandez< /user_name><text>I came here looking forward to some good Mexican food. I was very disappointed. The lady serving me was rude and lacked even the most basic customer service skills. I was horribly disgusted (although nowhere nearly as disgusted as my girlfriend) who ran out gaging when she found hair in her food!  When I told the lady about it, she said I should have called her over when it happened.... ."uhh hello! I just told you about it!" Not only that but she straight up didn't believe me and said that ppl do that all the time. So apparently this place gets people who put hair into their own food!! I guess that's what this place is know for. Basically she was calling me a liar. Needless to say after this horrid experience, I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK THERE AGAIN!<//text><Date>1530727279587<//Date>< Pictures>

Food is ok BUT it takes too long to be made. Prices are ok. The place especially the bathroom is dirty. ALOT of drunk people here. Fights can break out, people argue and drunk people flirt with the waitresses and customers too. I would go eat with my kids early on weekdays because after around 4pm Friday all day Saturday and all day Sunday, nothing but drunks and problems. Will not be coming back here its pretty scary seeing people wanting to fight each other.</review>

Mariachi music that they play is way too loud on some nights the last time I was there I ordered a chili verde burrito there was virtually no sauce and it it was dry and the meat seem to be sour very very sour there was no problem with returning it the portion that I didn't eat I did tip the waitress  $5 for her service but as far as the food was concerned I didn't care for it on that occasion.< /text>

Not only that but the food was horrendous I ordered chicken nuggets and frys for my boys since they had nothing else for kids when their food was served (chicken nuggets and frys) I was tempted to try my baby's frys they where still frozen!!!! My chicken was seasoned after it had been cooked it was disgusting!!! When will I  ever go back NEVER EVER EVER!!!! To top it of when we where leaving the idiots from the DJ they had where literatly right outside the door mind you blocking the exit and entrance smoking blowing their cigarette smoke on peoples faces starting with childrens this place is a complete joke I don't know how they have managed to stay in business! They do not have enough personnel  for the customers they have and the ones they do have lack adequate  customer service mannerisms.</text>< pics>

The live music was amazing great band, it was horribly overlooked because the waitress were extremely rude. Never been to an overpriced place where the service was so bad. Took a while to get our drinks and longer to get our food, which was cold. Do not recommend.<//Text>

<Review>This place is a joke , unacceptable service . Will never come here again .
- Their Not Efficient on cooking their food they take for Ever & bring it out one by one !
- Dont Even Clean the tables you have to ask them too !
- Food Is over Priced !
Save your money and go somewhere else.</Review><Time>1497849259397< /Time>< Rating>

I've been in this place 2-3 times the food does not taste good. I find it expensive considering that food is not good. They have live music on Fridays / Saturdays but for the kid that this place is a lot of noise you do not enjoy having dinner there

(Translated by Google) Delicious food and excellent employee attention. Very good atmosphere and great to liven up birthdays. They are unique. We feel at home. If you want to stop it in luxury, this is a good place.

<review>Favorite of our whole trip.  From the wine, views and service, this place is a hidden jam that you must visit.  Bob was amazing and so personable.  Ask for the story behind the black chicken and enjoy a truly relaxing tasting.< /review>< pics>

<text>Hard to go wrong visiting Robert Biale especially if you are a fan of zinfandels.  Our host Thomas served us 4 or 5 zins and each were outstanding. I should also note that Thomas as well as everyone we came in contact with at the winery were very friendly, knowledgeable and thus made our experience memorable.</text><gmapID>0x808501258a23de7b:0x3dd2ab6fa23f1b8f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This was our first, and favorite, stop of the trip. We were lucky enough to get Tom leading our tasting. He was so knowledgeable, fun, and entertaining! He made us feel like family and even called in a reservation at another winery nearby that ended up being our second favorite stop of the trip. Biale is laid back and beautiful with excellent wine. Thank you for the stellar experience! We will be back and we will make sure Tom is there!<//Review>

Jim took great care of us, and introduced us to some wonderful Zinfandels and Petit Syrahs. The vineyard is located just outside of the city of Napa, but there were tons of amazing views from the barn's back patio overlooking the hills.   AND there was live music the Saturday afternoon we were there. Overall, would recommend a visit to this wonderful vineyard.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlmfM3VwmDe8MGkWiFudRLOl3MEc-Gr3chKGBw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU87mVnqlQ8hlXdG4-k9Ofn6y62wII54Sd577s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

<Text>A very beautiful place to stop and have a tasting. The seats were outside on a patio in the shade. The grapes were only feet away from us. Our tasting guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. They also focus on zinfandel which many other wineries in napa don't do, so that was unique.</Text>< user_id>

<Review>Our experience with Robert Biale was amazing... it all started with our tasting reservation that was set up for us on June 6, 2018 with a nice sign with our names and at a table overlooking the vineyards and mountains. Stunning. Our sommelier was Jen Lee and she did a thorough job of educating, explaining their stories, (you know the story behind Black Chicken is a good one) and giving us time to relax and enjoy the vino. Great experience and a must-do when you are in Napa Valley next. -Joel and Carolyn, Frederick Maryland< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Iconic zinfandel
Good tasting on a classic Vineyard. Lots of history. Maybe only chance to taste some of the small Vineyard offerings of Biale as most allocations go to wine club. Surprise was the chief or Petit syrah. Lovely mocha nose</Text>

< Review>
Great visit, with Pat doing a great job hosting us. Elegant Zins with great acidity the essential of any great wine. The white Grecco is a very good Italian style white. Founders deep dive worth doing for enhanced understanding of the Biale wines.
Thanks Pat! Rob & Chris</Review>

<Date>1457586596273< /Date><username>Simone Regis Kamp</username><review>THE BEST ZINFANDEL IN THE WORLD!!If you are in Napa Valley you must visit Robert Biale vineyards.Owened by a traditional Italian family. I love all their Zinfandels, but my favorite is the Black Chicken. Me and my husband visit their vineyards and winery back in 2011, and we fall in love with it. Since then we became members, everytime we go to Napa we stop there. You should book a appointment for tasting. Their people are very friendly and knowledgeable, and make you feel like you just hanging out at your back yard. Truly, that is exactly what is the experience, facing their beautiful vineyards and the hills of Napa Valley.

I have never seen sooooo many boxes of all sizes in my entire life!!!  I seriously did not know such stores existed!! It was strangely satisfying seeing all the perfectly arranged precisely measured, sized boxes. Now that's a 100+ million views YouTube video right there!!</review>

This is probably one of the most completely stocked packing, shipping and moving supply stores I've been to.  They pretty much have everything!  I think their prices are reasonable and the staff is helpful.  Access to the store and parking is excellent also...

<text>Super convenient.. parking in back or on the street. Great local establishment with good prices and great selections on all things shipping related. Labels, tapes, packing peanuts, and boxes boxes and boxes of every possible size (it seems).

I just needed a couple of small bags of packing peanuts and made mental note of all the stuff they have. Pretty impressive.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>I have been a client here for over a decade. It's a great local place. A couple months ago I ran into Andy freaking Garcia. ANDY FREAKING GARCIA was buying boxes. This is a great place to get all your supplies, you name it they have it. They will help you load it and always are cheerful.</Review><user>103734828652068741892</user></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This is the go to place if your looking for a specific box size for something you are shipping as you will most likely find a box very close to the dimensions of the item you are shipping. They also sell moving boxes and other shipping/moving supplies. I believe they also offer shipping services too 👍🏼< /Text>< Pictures>

Very good food. Inattentive wait staff. Help you if they feel like it. Very nice when they are nice but often caught up in personal convos. Been many times. Pizza quality has fallen off. Cheap with some toppings.<//text>

I bought a few sport gears that wont fit in standard luggages, so we went to look for boxes that would fit all the gears while staying within the airline limit. The staffs were super helpful, and we found the perfect box with their help! Very happy with their service, highly recommended.</review>

People are really rude. They will yell instructions at you about how to carry the boxes but can't be bothered to help you with them. They all seem insanely lazy< /Review>

<Text>I have a Content Management Company and with all the rain came all the flooded homes and business.  I was running low on inventory and in a rush to get to a job.  I needed 100 boxes various sizes along with the necessary packing supplies, i.e. bubble wrap, tape, paper, popcorn and I normally just go to "the Home" place.  It was so out of my way and as I on my way and dreading the long lines and the search mission necessary to find what I want;   I saw Box City's bright yellow sign and decided to go in.  WOW! There was every size, style and shape you could imagine of boxes and every other item I needed to stock up for this job.  No lines, inventory was beautifully in order, personable and efficient staff and best of all they had lower prices!...a better name for this place would be Box Heaven and it's my new choice for boxes and packing accessories.

Thanks to all at Box City on Victory!

PS.  They also have other convenient locations..LOOK THEM UP!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I live in the neighborhood right behind this place, and as a resident its very very convenient to know that we don’t need to drive far to get snacks and other similar items. The management, which I’ve gotten to know well, is very kind and the store itself is clean but a little messy if you get there on a bad day. Restock day is on Wednesdays and Fridays I believe.</Text><rating>5< /rating>< pictures>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>This is a pretty good Dollar general. It's shelves are always full, and its employees are knowledgeable on what they have on their shelves and where you can find them. My only complaint is that on three separate occasions I noticed the manager acting very unprofessional. you don't talk down or correct your employees in front of customers in the manner of which this manager conducts themselves. Makes  customers,  uncomfortable .</Review>< Name>

Nice little store if you need to grab a few things. Aisles are a bit narrow. Checkout does tend to run a bit slow if there is a line. As generally there is only one clerk cashiering. A self checkout option would be fantastic.</text>

Convenience. A blessing for anyone who's living here at Bakersfield's Southern edge without a vehicle. Great sales. Good place for buying cat food. 😺</Review>

It was ok. Was surprised by the prices. Many were higher than Walmart or Albertsons. Seemed to have some good deals though. Really have to know prices to know if you're making a good deal.< /Review>

<rating>4</rating><review>This particular store was clean, organized and well stocked. I have been in others and was quite disappointed. The staff was friendly, and professional.  The only negative is that they need some security that focuses on just being a security person.  I  witness customers walking out stealing. I felt bad for the young girls on staff because there was nothing that they could do at that time...< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<name>Kenny Beals< /name><review>Only one employee was visible, but very few customers. I happen to get there just in time to help an elderly gentleman gather a few items. Employee was very courteous and attentive to the customer's needs as well as some general stocking when we walked in. I've been there a few times now and have always felt welcome. Just the place I'd want to work.</review>< Gmap_id>

I am very happy that this store decided to open in Pumpkin Center. Before this store opened I would pay way to much for everyday items.. But now I can just hop on my bike and shop for way way less but still good quality items. I Love Dollar General.. Thank you..</Text>

< Review>
Today I had an appointment and as I was waiting to be called suddenly a lady by the name of Maria Elena Escobar came out of her office raising her voice very loud stating she was the PSR Supervisor if we the patients had any complaints regarding the front desk staff to notified her that she will take care of the situation. I found this matter very unprefessional and very disagreeable on Ms.Escobar part. Everyone in the waiting room looked at each other very confused at the situation. I have been going to this clinic for many years and never have encounter such a staff member like Ms.Escobar that was very rude and disrespectful to the front desk and the patients. The front desk staff works very very hard to be front line workers during these hard times with Coronavirus and I don't think they deserved to be talked down specially from managment where that person need to show leadership. Ms.Escobar could've handle this situation very differently without raising her voice since she was only addressing the Latino community when this clinic is of mixed race her customer service was really poor.<//Review>

If your primary doctor is Dr. John Mull your in for a headache very hard to get a hold of him when you need him the most and when calling the clinic you have to call 10 times for someone to pick up would recommend for anyone lookin for a primary doctor to look elsewhere<//review>

I have been calling this office since 11 this morning they are not picking up called the other office and is the same thing and after 15 minutes the call gets disconnected. Maybe they are closed today i don't know but it's always something they accept way to many pt they can't keep up. Very disappointed.<//Review>

<review>HORRIBLE service. This place has a fake phone line and will not answer. They won't give me test results and made me chase them down for answers. DO NOT COME HERE. Youre better off going to the ER. I'm changing healthcare providers immediately<//review>< username>

It's good service. Even with appointment, I have had to wait 2 hours to see the doctor. Is such a bummer.
On the other hand, even if you just arrived on time to your appointment they still attend you, not like other clinics.
Good service.<//text>

Horrible customer service! The staff are not organized. when trying to get my appointment the lady wanted to give me the day she wanted and had a very rude look. She kept interrupting me when I was asking something. When I asked her to make a third appointment that my doctor suggested me to come see him the next day or two. They where trying to confuse me saying it doesnt say anything of that even though I told them he didnt told the nurse. He just wants me to make appointment for another problem and still they wouldn't understand. Then a supervisor wanted to talk to me and she and another where very rude and didnt mind that I came with anxiety and they wanted to talk to me about my appointments that I already understand. The supervisor wanted to sit me down so I do not block the hall way, which I wasn't and told her I cant because I have anxiety. I really didnt felt comfortable to be in a small room with them. I was very upset and stress and they still didnt understand. I guess they dont know how to care for patients. Also their phone number doesnt work or they dont answer. Takes a very long time waiting for them to answer. And the waiting is longer than should be. Huntington park clinic. Front desk peoplp are rude. The doctors are the best.<//review>

<resp>{'time': 1595959945048, 'text': "Dear Mr. Ramos: SCFHC does all it can to provide quality service to our patients. We understand how important your mother's health is to you; it is also important to us. SCFHC has strict policies about refililng prescriptions. These policies are designed to keep all patients safe, to avoid prescribing medication that is not needed or inapropriate. At times, we must collect important patient information (such as blood pressure, body weight, etc.) prior to refilling medication so that we can make sure that our patients (like your mom) are safe. Sometimes, refills cannot be fulfilled over the phone.\n\nWith regards to challenges with phone calls, we can share that SCFHC is experiencing significantly higher call volume due to COVID-19. Other clinics in the area and hospitals have also reported that they are seeing calls increase as much as 900% from normal; this makes sense since we are in the middle of a global health pandemic. With so many patients receiving care over the phone, our phone lines can reach capacity during peak hours. We are working on a solution, by adding additional phone lines. Ordering the systems, having them installed, and bringing new phone lines online will take time.  We too are anxious to have this problem resolved.\n\nIt is our privilege to care for all our patients, including your mother. We are working hard to address the challenges we are facing as health providers in the midst of a global health pandemic."}< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Horrible customer service. I think the lady that is always looking like she’s having a bad day goes by Carlota. She has like a mole on her face? Whole point I went in as a new patient to get a physical exam done for a program. Never in my three visits was I told that my form needed to be turned in, that it would take 7-10 business days for it to be filled out, and that I shouldn’t have ate before going in. Only after asking about having someone fill out my form did that receptionist says that I should’ve turned it in on my first visit. She made me feel like i was supposed to know how their system works and overall had a horrible attitude. On the first day I was there, their system wasn’t working so they could look up people on the computer. After a while I noticed that SAME receptionist looking at her computer and calling patients up so I decided to go up to her and ask her if the system was up and she says”yes it is how can I help you?”. I told her why hasn’t she called me up and her response was that the system had barely gone up which was an apparent lie since she was using her computer and putting patients through. The nurses and doctors here are amazing! It’s a pity that the receptionist can’t do their job efficiently< /text>

As a woman I get the best medical care for me and my daughter from The Medical Dr.’s who are on point with the service such as Dr.Elizabeth she is AMAZING . The Dental clinic though man that is the worst I wouldn’t recommend it ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A KID 4 years or older the dentist DO NOT ALLOW PARENTS TO ENTER WITH THE KIDS DURING ANY PROCEDURE EVEN FOR A SIMPLE CHECK UP ITS IS OBSURD AND RIDICULOUS KIDS CANNOT MAKE DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN! You cannot arrive 5 mins late to the dentist because you get skipped and also just to make an appointment the lady with glasses and dark hair who is at the front desk is a Joke she acts as if she even does her job instead of simply rescheduling an appointment herself she tells you to give her a second in which you assume she will help next thing you know you been sent to voicemail to leave a message with your name and number ..like why even bother answering the phone if you will make me talk to a machine I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE DENTAL AREA just go somewhere else where they allow kids and parents to enter together< /review>

Their pediatric department is a complete joke. Keep in mind my kid hasn't started school yet.  They're are analyzing kids at a young age claiming they have ADHD at toddler stages (probably for insurance money). Based off of "clinical" observations, and have no experience in child development. We followed all referrals to remove negative marks they gave our kid and each specialist said she is okay and shows no sign of ADHD or need of psychiatric help. Yet upon bringing her back even with proper paper work proof they insist something is wrong with our kid and we should look for further help. Toddlers are toddlers. I can't comprehend even with concrete evidence they still try to refer you out again. Giving you a bs statement saying they know what they see and that it's hard to accept as a parent that your kid needs help. Hello!!! I followed all your referrals and my child proved to be okay and you still wanna refer me out. Scam scam scam.... Horrible pediatric department only good doctor here is Noya the rest are inexperienced or rather unqualified. Then there is their rude front desk staff and the self entitled nurses who act like they're more qualified than doctors and really impatient.<//Text>

<Text>I went there last week my 2yr old had a Physical and we were 13 minutes late since I work grave yard. The lady in the front desk said we were 17 minutes late therefore my baby had to reschedule her Physical. I had been like that for MONTHS. I like the Dr.'s but their service is something I defenitely DON'T RECOMMEND. Their attitude doesn't go with their profession since I didn't approached them rudely. Definitely CHANGING MY KIDS CLINIC!.<//Text></record>

<review>(Translated by Google) Please if you think of taking COVID19 test here AVOID it and look for another place or be extra careful. They are unorganized and they don't take safe precautions. There's chairs where everyone sits sick and none sick ... While I was there they did not disinfect. Also they allow anyone in there not just the people who are going to get tested and social distance is irrelevant. So if you are not sick there's a chance you can get it here.

Please be very careful if you plan to take a COVID 19 test in this place or find another place. They are very disorganized and do not take adequate precautions for the safety of patients. There are chairs where all the sick and those who are not sit. While I was there they did not disinfect anything. Also let anyone in, not just the test takers and social distance is irrelevant. So if one is not sick there is a possibility to get infected here.

Por favor si piensa tomar examen de COVID 19 en este lugar tenga mucho cuidado o busque otro lugar. Son muy desorganizados y no toman la precaución adecuada para la seguridad de los pacientes. Hay sillas donde todos se sientan los enfermos y los que no estan. Mientras estuve ahi no desinfectaron nada. Tambien perminten a cualquier persona adentro no solamente los que tomaran la prueba y la distancia social es irrelevante. So si uno no esta enfermo ahí una posibilidad en contagiarse aquí.</review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I got my child with a fever pump and they didn't want to pass it to me with the doctor. I go to the emergency room. I think it's not right if they don't have a place. But they should give preority to the sick without a site so I better change my clinic very badly.

<time>1616531234760<//time><Text>(Translated by Google) Dr Alexander does not do referrals for county specialists well, does not answer them when specialists want more information from the patient and they get canceled My wife went with lower back pain and Dr Monica told her that It wasn't her kidneys because they never hurt. After a year I took her to the emergency room for the same pain and they found stones in both kidneys and they had to do surgery.
And they go 3 times that when Dr Alexander gives a prescription to fill at walgreens if he is not missing the date, he is missing the signature or the # of medications.
Today I went to pick up a prescription for my wife, and Dr. Alexander did not give it to me.

(Original)
El Dr.Alexander no hace bien las referencias para los especialistas del condado , no las contesta cuando los especialistas quieren más información del paciente y se cancelan.Mi esposa fue con dolor en la parte baja de la espalda y la Dra.Monica le dijo que no eran los riñones porque nunca duelen ,al año la lleve a emergencias por el mismo dolor y le encontraron piedras en los 2 riñones y le tuvieron que hacer cirugia.
Y van 3 veces que cuando el Dr.Alexander da una receta para surtir en walgreens si no le falta la fecha , le falta la firma o el # de medicamentos.
Hoy fui a recoger una receta para mi esposa, y el Dr Alexander no me la dio.</Text>< user_name>

<Text>None< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1595958749666, 'text': "Dear Ms. Chopin:  Your child's health is important to us, and we are doing the best that we can during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical professionals across this country are putting their lives at risk to provide health care services, and the doctors at SCFHC are no different. We are doing everything we can to provide medical care in an environment where we must reduce the number of patients we can see so that we can sanitize exam rooms and waiting areas; these are preventative measures taken to protect your safety and that of our staff.\n\nSince March, 60% of our visits have moved from in-person to over the phone. SCHFC is also one of the few clinics that provides free COVID-19 testing to the community. The increased use of telephones means that it has become more difficult to reach us during peak hours; we recommend that patients attempt to reach us at non-peak hours such as from 9am-11am, or from 2pm-4pm, to avoid long-wait times.\n\nWe regret that your experience did not meet your expectations. SCFHC's doctors and staff have had to make significant adjustments during this pandemic, and it is taxing on all of us.  To clarify a few items you brought up, for the public.\n\n1) SCFHC offers parking to the public, when it is available. We have never guaratneed parking, and support the use of public transporation and walking to reduce carbon footprints. Furthermore, none of SCFHC's facilities have parking structures.\n\n2) SCFHC maximizes our provider's scheudles, meaning that we will ALWAYS accommodate a sick and symptomatic patient who may be suffering or in pain when scheduled patients do not arrive on time. On any given day, we have several patients that wake up with unforseen illnesses, and we do our best to have a medical provider attend to their needs. We will never allow a baby with a fever, for example, to suffer in our waiting rooms; they will be seen by a doctor. This has been and always will be our practice.\n\nRegardless of your decision to continue with us as a patient, SCFHC remains committed to providing you and all of our patients with the highest quality of service possible."}< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c85e208a17bd:0xb9b5af00f6463096</gmap_id></record>

Good ol' family diner with exactly the kind of hearty breakfast options you'd expect. Service was a little overly casual but the food was good and I enjoyed supporting a local business.</text>

Jose's is a great place to eat. He and his wife are attentive and take care of the customers  very well. I have been going there for at least years. I do believe they make the best burgers in town,  no other place makes them so tasty!</review>

Their prices are insanely low and the food is great. Where on this planet can you get a burger, fries AND drink for $6.95? It all tasted very good and customer service is fabulous. Best in Redding for reasonable good food.</review>

<text>It's like finding a secret portal to a place and time that you just can't find anymore. Very friendly, remembered my order from a single visit 3 weeks ago. A nice cozy diner that is hidden in an industrial area, delicious home cooked food and amazing atmosphere, like going to your family and friends house for breakfast.< /text><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>My husband and I were WELCOME   by Jose and his wife . Found service to be  awesome with  that  homemaid taste and feeling.  Definently a awesome place. We shall return soon for those daily specials Jose's famous for. The atmosphere was quite with music in background.  I ordered  quavo ranchero with home fries. Rick ordered 2 eggs over easy ham potatoes an toast.  Both had coffee and reasonable prices our bill was 16.78$. Loved our meals.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>You will never find a vet as compassionate, caring, attentive, and knowledgeable as we have in our small town. Our pets have been going to Roberta for 12 years and I wish everyone had a vet they could trust like her. She had done our normal immunizations, spay and neuters, has done an amputation on an adopted pup of ours, helped through dog pregnancy, and injuries. There’s nothing we can bring her that she can’t handle. Desiree is the most wonderful addition to their already stellar team. Our local community is the luckiest to have this vet here in our small town.< /text>< user_id>

I wouldn't trust my fur babies with anyone else. This is a great clinic! We have 3 dogs and 3 cats so we visit the vet somewhat often for all their checkups and shots. Everyone is super nice, helpful and genuinely care about our babies. It's a clean friendly environment that doesn't freak my dogs out like most vet waiting rooms. It's open and nice. I really don't have anything negative to say about Chester Veterinary clinic. Your fur babies are safe here.<//review>

<Review>Our GSD had foot surgery a few days ago, at a different veterinary hospital. We took him to Dr. Roberta for a dressing change. Of course, this one year old is freaked out going to a veterinarian clinic. But, the staff and Dr. Roberta were absolutely wonderful with him! We are so appreciative of the great care given to our Wolfie!!<//Review>< gmapID>

However the vet was clearly afraid of german shepherds. That did surprise me, considering her field of work. She did share her fears with me which also surprised me. She was able to administer the shot, despite displaying fearful behavior.  I was glad she was able to do her job, but it did bring some concern to mind. Like how well is my gsd going to be examined when I have a vet that is afraid to reach out to touch him. I still bring my gsd there, but I wish she was more comfortable being hands on with them.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x809d6a242523420d:0x2136c0af7cfe7d2a< /gmapID></record>

<Text>Excellent burger with that thick crusty grilled style, but even better they will put that on a salad! Excellent mix of regular and sweet potato fries and a rich shake!

< review>
First time here after hearing a lot about it. Newish chain out of Texas,  with only a handful in northern California. Very good. Think a combination between 5 Guys and Burger Lounge. Appears to be more organic. I noticed that they even bake the buns whole and slice them just before preparing your burger to order. Lots of toppings. One unique thing - their shakes come with extra wide straws because the shakes ( especially the Oreo shake) are very thick. Seems to be kid friendly,  although today was a holiday.  Generous portion of fresh cut fries. This deserves a solid 4+ .<//review>

<Review>MOOYAH is awesome. Their Chili cheese fries are delicious as are their burgers. The restaurant itself is clean, colorful, and has a huge chalk wall for kids to draw on.

Pricing is on the high side. They over cook the fries all the time. Too bad cause the fries are cut fresh daily and are large enough to have some meat in them but the owner thinks over cooking them is the right thing to do and it just ruins otherwise awesome fries. Swiss Mushroom burger is great but too dry, needs more mayo. The hamburger meat quality is OK but could be better. We do not go to Habit burger because the meat quality is poor and Mooyah is right on the edge, they need to improve the meat quality or we will go back to In N Out once again.<//Text>

Consistently great burgers, and we absolutely love both fries (regular, and sweet potato) and always get a mix. Only complaint we have is that they stopped serving the chicken sandwiches, which were awesome!! But, now we go for the burgers and are equally pleased. Four thumbs up from two of us.<//Review>

My food is ready quickly and I enjoy each bite. Gustavo has taken my order recently and got to chat with him a bit while waiting for my food.

Almost every time the employees chat with me which makes waiting for my food feel quick.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>The first couple times I came here, the food was awesome, but the service was slow. The last 3 times I've been here, the food was just as awesome but the service was MUCH faster -- less than 5 minutes or so from order to eating.

The fries are some of the best I've had anywhere, the burgers are juicy & tender & delicious, & the bread the burgers are served on is excellent. I have not had a shake recently, but the last time I had one it was so thick I had to walk it home before I could start slurping on it. The staff is friendly & helpful, & overall, I will come back to Mooyah's again & again & again. A bit on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for!!!< /Review>< name>

MOOYAH caught my attention in a hurry - tremendously juicy hamburger with excellent flavor. A great bun, crisp and fresh toppings, solid fries and a very good milkshake were an added bonus. Combine that with a very pleasant and entertaining young man at the counter taking our order and this will definitely not be our last time at MOOYAH!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<Text>Usually okay.  But this last visit was a super bummer.  Walked in for a web order and gave them the name, the lady behind the counter said "we are working on your order." While I noticed a finished order that was ready to go sitting to the sise.  I waited for a solid twenty minutes.  The order remained untouched.  Asked the status and she then remarked "oh this is yours". So the order basically sat there for twenty minutes getting cold while the chick also lied about the order.  Not awesome.</Text>< user>

I don't see how Mooyah can get such as high rating. First off they take forever to get orders out. Secondly, there's something about their burgers, they have a plastic aftertaste! It's not just my burgers.<//Text>

Nice to see another place in town with good burgers, lots of topping choices, tasty shakes, and good fries (regular and sweet potato). Small place in a strip mall. Clear / understandable menu with limited choices (although my wife hadn't noticed that hot dogs were an option until our most recent visit). But they are obviously subscribing to the idea of doing a relatively small number of things very well.

They introduced a turkey sandwich last Fall. I tried it once and, while not "bad", was not nearly as good as their burgers. But, if your group includes someone who doesn't want to eat beef, it's an OK choice.

On my latest visit, noticed that they now have brewed iced tea. I hadn't remembered that, thinking it was from a disgusting mix. This will be a good option for when I'm not being extra naughty and getting a shake.

Friendly staff and reasonably fast service, considering things are being made to order.</Review>

Awesome burgers (for this type of place). I prefer burgers cooked to order, but these are all done at one temperature (medium well I guess?) but they are super tasty. Great shakes as well. Only thing I don't really like here are the fries. They tend to be overcooked.<//text>

<review>I came here twice on a trip to Los Gatos. Both times I got a gluten free bun and a turkey burger, but with different options. My husband got a regular burger and the gluten free bun as well. We had both the sweet potato and regular fries- we definitely favored the regular fries. The food was really good and filling without making you feel gross after. I'll definitely return next time I'm in town.< /review>< resp>

<text>Awesome burgers (for this type of place). I prefer burgers cooked to order, but these are all done at one temperature (medium well I guess?) but they are super tasty. Great shakes as well. Only thing I don't really like here are the fries. They tend to be overcooked.</text>< pictures>

One of my favorite burger places. Lots of options and ingredients available including turkey or chicken, and fresh on-site baked buns. Excellent fries, especially the sweet potato. Would be 5 stars except that the prices are a bit high.</review>

<Review>Really great burgers with lots of choices for toppings. Sweet potato fries are awesome. Give them a try even if you don't like sweet potatoes! Service is always friendly and orders are served quickly. So nice to have Mooyah in the neighborhood as an alternative to dry and overcooked fast food burgers. Enjoy!< /Review>< pics>

I eat here at least once a week since it opened, great food! The service people, From Jeff, to Tony, to John on the grill, all top notch folks that take care of their regulars! Hats off to the management that gave the first 100 customers free fries for a year for showing up on the right day. Can' t go wrong with that! They will also do a chicken sandwich if you ask nicely, and don't forget to tip if they do make it for you!< /text>

<Review>Moooyeahh!!! This place is awesome. Oh my goodness.. dripping with flavor. If you want a real burger, this the place. If you like all the other, Fake (fast food) burgers, this will make you hate them.

A little pricey so I can't take my family too often, but when I do, it's well deserved.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
The food was great, and the fries were good. However, the service was horrible.

We were in a 2 person line for around 5 minutes waiting to simply order, with only around 4 other people in the restaurant. Then when we finally put our order down we wait 30 minutes to get our food. You would think with 9 PEOPLE, "working" they could put down food fast. Nope. Oh, and only 2 people are actually working.

The burgers were simply fantastic though, so I can't give them less than 3 stars.</review>

<Text>Burger patties have great flavor. Seasoned just enough; in-house baked buns are really nice. The standard potato is good and the multi grain is probably sweeter than it needs to be(like most commercial wheat bread), but tasty.

Fries are natural, pub style fries, like at Five Guys, but are cooked properly (i.e., not floppy). The large size fries fills a whole serving tray, so beware.

Just wish the raw onions came as a full round, or longer julienned pieces instead of the chiclet size pieces.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Okay I just wandered across this place by accident yesterday and went in to grab myself a burge. I was hungry and I actually saw the Philly cheesesteak place that store that is it going to be burgers today.I'll get back to the cheesesteak place though it would be that later for you. all but one time being a connoisseur of milkshakes no longer very muon fries or shakes but my wife and I both love a good burger. I'll tell you what the menu selection was amazing and it was a little bit  discombobulating  interpret infthe menu. I didn't even really see the shakes on there but I wasn't having one anyways. best I could tell they best I could tell they had traditional burgers best I could tell they had traditional burgers best I could tell they had traditional burgers best I could tell they had traditional burgers best I could tell they had traditional burgers best I could tell they had traditional burgers best I could tell they had traditional burgers best I could tell they had traditional burgers best I could tell they had traditional burgers that were best I could tell they had traditional burgers that were all usedbest I could tell they had traditional burgers that were best I could tell they had traditional burgers that were best I could tell they had traditional burgers that were all usedbest I could tell they had traditional burgers that were best I could tell they had traditional burgers that were all used to cheese burgers etc specialty Burger House style and build your own Burger. I ended up going with an off the menu house standard Swiss mushroom burger and it was Dynamite.  Ordered my girl  a double cheeseburger cuz she likes cheeseburgers and it was muy Bueno. Nothing special about the establishment as far as decor go or ambiance but it is nice and clean. All in all just on the basis of old school, stomach filling, 100% Angus beef real burgers that I definitely couldn't taste a difference, four stars. I will definitely go back again.</Review>< time>

Best damn sweet potato Texas style chili cheese fries, hands down! Not to mention the veggie burger is mouthwatering with lots of wonderful flavors, too. Met the owner and he is a good representation of how a business should be ran. This establishment showed us military personnel lots of love which tbh, is a first in the bay area in my experience. I highly recommend Mooyah to anyone looking for a fun & delicious meal.<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I sat in a three person 'line' for more than 5 minutes at around 9PM. During that time, two of the three people ahead of me left (without food) and I did not see the employee at the register take any orders. There were a number of people sitting in the restaurant, but I didn't see anyone eating. During the time I was waiting they cooked one burger and served one shake.  I left without ordering, and when I did, I think the third person in front of me also walked out.  I am very confused by this establishment.< /text>< pictures>

Not to sound racist, but what happened to the local kids that used to work here, were they asking for to much that you had to replace them with undocumented workers?< /Text>< pictures>

Not great fries and decent burgers. It's a decent joint but by far not my favorite burger spot. The fries were just so bad and kinda cold even. Were they not as fresh as my burger? Who knows, but it was not awesome.</text>

<review>Okay burgers.. Underflavored and hit or miss as to whether it's nearly juicy enough or completely dry like most of them do it. heavy not juicy or crispy veggies. Snooty staff, one  young guy in the back outright gave me attitude and all I did was have my order corrected and ask for more sauce. I even pointed out that the first error was not his but the boy at the register because he made me feel badly for coming back to have my order fixed. Glared at me, said "what's wrong with it now" when I came back for napkins and sauce.<//review>< pictures>

<review>Will never eat at MooYah again. I waited in line for 9 minutes. There was one person in front of me. The very nice kid at the counter was alone. He had to answer the phone 3 separate times to take phone orders. Including right in the middle of the lady in front of mines order. I don't blame him. He was very nice, professional and apologetic. But it was unacceptable. And just so I'm clear this is the 4th time in 2 years I've been to this MooYah. Exact same experience. 1 counter person working their butt off and 4 "cooks" mostly standing around laughing or goofing off. Make one of them answer phones.

Later I saw there was no one in line so I went up to get a milkshake. Stood there for 6 more minutes while he transferred a DoorDash order from a tablet to his system. Again, he was apologetic, but all I wanted was a milkshake. Completely unacceptable.  I just walked away and we went to Yogurtland instead. They don't value your business.

The food was really good, probably my favorite, but I'll go to 5Guys,Smashburger or The Habit before I'll ever go to mooyah again. Too bad they have terrible service.< /review><resp>{'time': 1536590066544, 'text': 'Aron,  Would you mind sending us an email at loyalty@mooyah.com with a good phone number & email address so that we can reach out to you?

This was the second time they got my to-go order wrong, so I took it back and pointed out there was no avocado on my now cold burger. Their solution: take the top of the bun, scrape off some of the topping, add avocado and wrap it back up. Bingo, I now had a cold, soggy burger with avocado. Really? You might think they would make the order up again!< /text>

I have been here a few times and everything has good.  Our burger were so horrible I could not finish it.  My husband and I oreded burgers with grilled onions they said they were out. (HAHA) they couldn't grill some raw onions? I asked for bacon and pickles and BBQ sauce.  Guess what no Bacon no BBQ sauce no pickles. There was no flavor to the beef burgers either.  I am so disappointed.  Oh they close at 9 and the turned off the open sign at 8:30, they even turned customers away.  took all the chairs from outside in and started closing all tables around us.

Have no idea what people are raving about. Very small burgers. Frys cost extra. In my burger the pasty was very hot, tomato slices very cold and I could taste either under extremely strong tasting souse.< /Review>

< Review>
I decided to have the motor rebuilt in my boat after an awful boating season a year and a half ago; chasing problem after problem. Eventually, I found the entire head for cylinders 2,4,6,8 had little compression. Not knowing exactly where to go, I did some shopping and eventually came across Paul at Rezurxn Speed and Marine. I spoke with Paul several times over the phone and met with him in person before deciding to have him rebuild my motor. First and foremost, I want to thank Paul for turning my boating season around last year. My family and I had an opportunity to use something we love to do dearly without having any major problems and am confident we will continued to do so as the years come and go.

I want to begin by explaining what I had built. A one sentence review does no one any good. I went from a factory 454 Mercruiser motor that was poorly re-built by the person who owned the boat before me. Once progress started, I had to remain optimistic and patient because I wanted it built correctly the first time. There was no short cuts and attention to detail was paramount for my wife and I. Once the engine was pulled, Paul remained in contact with me and updated me each step of the way. I was hopeful to reuse some parts of the motor to cut down cost; however, as the engine was disassembled, Paul found several crucial components were damaged beyond re-use. This was at the fault of a poor engine builder. The parts were saved and Paul was able to show them to me and explained why they were damaged. Looking at each part, it was obviously damaged and I would have been foolish to re-use the parts. At no point did I feel he was trying to get into my wallet. They were broken parts plain and simple. Parts that cannot be seen from looking at the outside of a motor. Paul was able to give me options on what to do which included cheaper parts and more expensive performance parts. Paul explained to me the pros and cons of each as well as providing his input on what he would do if it was his. I listened to his recommendations some of which were in my favor for lower cost.

This engine build grew into quite the project, I didn't have a crystal ball to look into. Turns out who ever machined the engine, did it wrong and machined each side of the engine to two different cylinder bore sizes and put smaller pistons in the even side. Paul was able to determine the rings of the piston didn't even touch and was the cause for the poor compression. I explain this because several things have to happen at the point, machine work, nitrating a crank, matching a cam shaft, carburation, intake size,  the list is just about endless. At this point, I decided to BUILD a motor, If I have to replace major parts I might as well make it generate more horse power. All aluminum heads, valves, springs, pushrods, etc. were replaced with performance parts. That kind of prep work takes time.

Once reassembly began, Paul remained in contact with me; keeping me updated each step of the way. After paint and powder coat was finished, the engine was fully reassembled and placed onto a break in stand. I had the opportunity to push the button at Paul's shop to start my motor for the first time and listen to it before it went back into my boat.

I take great pride in the things I own and Paul is the same way. He and his guys at the shop treated my boat as if it was their own. Again, attention to detail is paramount and it shows. I must say good work takes time. This project didn't happen over night, it didn't even happen in a month, but its important that you understand when you have something custom built, that means its one of a kind. There is no other motor that looks, sounds, drives like mine. This isn't an engine that's getting built by the 1000's on an assembly line somewhere.

I have since been back to Rezurxn Speed and Marine to have my boat stereo installed and soon to have a sub enclosure built for my mustang. I most definitely recommend this location to anyone and will continue to go there myself for any of my performance needs.< /Review>

So I have been around the block a few time trying to find a performance shop that can fulfill my needs of building my 2019 mustang gt for the pikes peak hill climb race. I have run in to many issues with other shops but paul has been nothing other than helpful and has done the best work I have had done on the car. trying to find a reliable and trust worthy shop is hard but rezurxn will help you with all your build needs anything from old school to new school this is the shop to go to.</Review>

However, with a rating of 4.4 we are not doing to bad, but we know there is always room for improvement. Nonetheless, we realize that we can always improve to provide better service for our customers. Having said that, and that you mention you have never been in my shop, I would like to invite you to the shop so we can show you what we do, the equipment and tools we continue to upgrade, and discuss with you the changes we have made since opening in 2015, in order to provide the best service possible and continue to improve our service. We realize, as a fairly young business, we have a lot of growing to do and that includes enduring growing pains. I would encourage you to look for yourself and set aside the gossip. The last round of gossip that was shared with us was that I was one of the largest cocaine distributors for the mob...and nothing could be farther from the truth. Smh...Hopefully, you come in and find out for yourself what we are all about and I look forward to the opportunity of meeting you. After all, the photos of our completed work didn't build themselves, almost all of our customers are very satisfied as reflected in the mostly positive reviews and we are proud of our work. We will always strive to be better tomorrow than we are today, and with that let me thank you again for bringing this to our attention.\nBest Regards\nPaul Ferris"}<//Resp>

<text>Paul and his crew should of got 10 stars.  Their attention to detail and customer service was exceptional.  I had lots of questions that were answered without any hesitation.  They fixed some major issues with my 383 stroker motor that several mechanics weren’t able to find and fix.  The motor is very responsive and idles nice and smooth.  Paul explained all my issue In great detail and was clear on what needed to be done.  Great experience!!!!!</text></record>

< Review>
Shop had my truck for 10 months.   Yes 10 months it was for a sema build.  Paul the owner said he needed it for 3 months before sema so I got it there aug 17 I drove in to pick up my truck for sema thinking there was just a couple loose ends to be taken care of but show up to a truck with everything taken apart. Paul apologized for it then said he would make it up to me fast forward another 7 months after sema and I finally get tired of waiting and go pick it up.  Truck was scratched bumpers scratched no radio playing rear end that he just redid cause they messed it up the first time failed. Shop stole my warn 16.5ti winch my hitch and power supply as well.  Note to anyone that does business here you will get taken advantage of have numerous guys I met during the time that my vehicle was there and all said the same thing< /Review>

It is never rewarding when you lose an engine...especially when you buy it on Ebay!

Been here for tattoo once with Sunny and piercing twice with Hector. Both are amazing and caring ppl with quick response time, made sure I was comfortable, and answered all of my questions with details.
The covid protocols were followed and place is clean and neat.
Already have a future appointment with another tattoo artist!</Text>

Hector was so professional and helpful throughout the entire experience! Made everything so easy and I felt safe and comfortable as a client. I would 100% go back for any piercing! He explained ever He was doing and answered any question I could think of.< /text>

< Review>
I recently was tattooed by Eli (my first tattoo also) and he was excellent. He explained everything thoroughly, and made sure I was comfortable and aware of what he was doing. The shop is clean, professional, and easy to work with. I'll likely be back again in the future. Thanks again Eli for everything! I'd post photos of my tattoo but it's still healing.< /Review>

I've seen Duy at My Tattoos for three separate tattoos. He is fast and very creative. Duy made me feel at ease and  played horror movies for me. I love all my tattoos.
The first one, on my upper arm,  is absolutely stunning, creative and gorgeous!  I have people stop me and tell me how unusual and beautiful it is. All my tattoos are family tributes so they're very special to me.
The other two are very beautiful but the first one I'm just obsessed!
Anybody wanting a quality, artistic and professional tattoo go see Duy at My Tattoos<//Review>

<Review>I cannot rave enough about my experience at My Tattoo and with David. I knew I wanted a tattoo on my forearm and went to David (after spending HOURS on website portfolios to find somebody I wanted to go to) to talk to him about my ideas. I was nervous because this would be the biggest piece I have yet, and its in full sight! He blew me away with his design, it was exactly what I wanted, but his artistic input made it even better!< /Review><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd26e9603d2253:0x4eeb2dd3f8e07544< /Gmap_id>< userid>

<Text>Great hospitality and professionalism. Jason did an amazing job on my tattoo. From the color and detail and quickness of the job, I am truly impressed. Jason has a very gentle hand and I was comfortable throughout the whole session.

Bel, his wife, sweet and kind from the start and is a great spirit. I am glad to have met her because she reassured me that I was in the right place and the right time. Overall, worth it.<//Text>< pics>

I got two half sleeves done by Luke and am in love with both pieces. I got a koi and a ryu (dragon), one on each arm, and they are exceptional pieces. I gave Luke a loose framework (koi + water, ryu + water and maybe clouds) and he came up with some great original artwork.< /Text>

Everyone here is awesome!!! Both their art and their personalities are top notch. Remain humble when speaking with any of them and do not forgot that this is a craft that took them years and years to become good at. They will not lie to you or waste your time. Yes means Yes and No means No. Only place I have gotten tattooed at and I don't regret anything.</text>

Count me in as one of the fans here! Body Manipulations rocks! Muchas gracias to the guy working there today who helped me re-put on a piercing, and who did it quickly, professionally, and kindly, and didn't charge me. I very much appreciate the kindness. Thanks again!  :-)<//Review>

<Review>They do legit work. The artist here are talented, professional and award winning. The piercing person is only there certain days so call ahead. Walk-ins are welcome but it's best to make an appointment.< /Review><rating>5</rating>< pics>

From Florida. Went here to get a anime character I have liked for a while. They were very organized, easy to talk, and knew exactly what they were doing. If your looking to get a tattoo in orange county this is the place to go. The tattoo turned out better than the picture I have them. Would give more than 5 stars if I could. Thanks duy for the awesome experience.</text>

Very courteous staff. Clean facility. Professionals work here. I was created by their staff and they were willing to work with me right on the spot. I saw their work on Instagram and was immediately drawn to the realism of their work. I highly recommended this place as I've received a tattoo at their hb location. Ask for Andy Tran!!!<//Text>

<Review>On my last day in HB I got my nose pierced there.I payed 30 Dollars what I first thought was ok. I told the piercer that I wanted a ring and even showed him the sice of it ( I bought it arleady). He told me I had to put in a pin first and then change it. Unforthunately they only had ONE!!! pin left to pierce. Since I had to fly back to germany the day after I still did it eventhough it was an ugly one.
I left the pin in for one month eventhough he told me to leave it only for 1-2 weeks. But some friends told me it needs to be in there at least one month. Now one month later I wanted to change the pin to the ring in a tattoo studio in germany. After talking to many of them they keep telling me that it is just pierced on a wrong spot in the nose. The hole is way to up in the nose so no ring will fit ( well ok- a huge one maybe..) So now I had to take it all out and I need to do it again! So I defenitely NOT recommend this store!!< /Review><Name>Lena Lemmermann<//Name><time>1447003777103</time>< rating>

Good quick service for ordering inside; unfortunately, I can not say the same about driver delivery service, I notice the staff and the driver were totally disconnected, no hand sanitizer for the customers, public restroom still closed and not inside eating allowed yet.<//text>

I celebrated my graduation today in this gorgeous place. Well we passed a phenomenal evening and the place was absolutely the reason for that outstanding celebration. The crew  cooperated in a very nice style, the meals were extremely good and my friends were extremely  happy. We shall absolutely come back again for more events. Thank you very much.</review>

I really wish I could give this place less then one star not only did they get my order wrong the first time. But when I finally got home with my order I realized the the egg in the breakfast sandwiches I had order was molding!

Be careful this place might give you food poisoning<//Review>

We love eating out. Yesterday we came to this delicious place which friends recommended to us. We spent a beautiful experience there with first-rate meal and an efficient crew and an impressive  chef. We put this fine restaurant in our list  and we shall no doubt go again soon. We deeply recommend.<//Text>

<text>This place is beyond filthy and they take way too long to get your food ready workers there or cussing and talking about nonsense when they should be focused on the customer taking orders and giving out food this place straight smelled like human poop where you order.To top it off they forget items like a meal with no fries or kids meal with no drink or chocolate Sunday with no peanuts ...common you cant forget the peanuts !!!!! Maybe if you focuses on your Simple job and stop goofing around Like your manager says , PUT ATTENTION, You wouldnt have these types of mistakes . NEVER COMMING BACK...and it gets worst There was a long hair in the chocolet Sunday ,I wanna throw up</text>< Pictures>

Great service during Covid. Fast and friendly. I would recommend for everyone to  order from the McDonald's app and it will apply any deals they have automatically if it matches any of their current deals.<//Review>

Whether it being no sauce with my chicken nuggets (even though I specifically ask for BBQ Saucs), or giving me the wrong size fries, wrong size drink, or just whole items missing from my order, its always something with this location to where I have to start checking inside my bag before I drive off and almost every time I still have to tell them "oh I didn't get any BBQ sauce"< /Text>< Pictures>

They have great staff specially the guy taking orders i didn't got his name .but he has great customer service skills. Thay makes the waiting worth it. The drive thru waiting is normal 5min-15 min keeping in mind its a busy MC Downloads restaurant.< /review>

<text>The service is to slow the employees must be retrained. The man's restrooms smell like sewer and the restaurant had the door open its horrible for the tables near the restrooms or for anyone who needs to use the restroom.  Then you have a bunch of homeless all around we had one who came to our table asking for money.
They need to have a more healthy environment for the customers if customers don't complaint than the ones who run this establishment will keep ignoring the comments and will keep running this place like their keep their homes.</text>< Pics>

Came to this mcdonalds because its my local one. Received my  order incorrect and they didnt even give me a receipt to go back and exchange it. Even when i went back the line was so long and couldn't even get my order fixed. Very disappointed with this mcdonalds and wouldn't recommend coming here as they do not have friendly customer service staff.< /text>

Who's idea was it to fry up a potato, GENIUS idea. If I do say so myself.  I believe there is a lot of competition out there as to who makes the best 🍟 fries.  McDonald's is a leading competitor along with their dipping sauce.  Thank you!!!< /text>

The food is very good and fast but also bad. some of the fries felt soggy and like there were left out for up to an hour or more also there were long lines on the drive-thru almost all the time but I can't deny that the most of the food there is delicious<//Review>

<text>Slowest McD... In the world!

Be prepared to wait 20 minutes plus no matter the time of day. If you are getting breakfast in the morning on a weekend... Forget it. Might as well go to the Denny's across the street, you'll eat and be out before you would get your order here.< /text>< pictures>

I have eaten here on a few occasions and from my experiences, the food is decent. I've never got anything bad enough to return. The lines can be long and take a while, especially in the drive-thru. There is normally always a bum standing outside asking for money, if you don't see him he is most likely inside taking a break. Overall, this place is decent. If I was hungry and needed a quick bite, I would stop on by.<//review>

Omg.... I cant believe the service here at this Mc Donnells real bad service and the resturant is filty...the dinning area...the worker is too bust with his ear plugs talking on his phone than paying attention to detail . Like the tables need to be cleaned after ckearing it. There were condiments spillage all over and not wioed dwn. I took pictures and i have reported this resturant to the health dept.< /review>

<Review>I have eaten here on a few occasions and from my experiences, the food is decent. I've never got anything bad enough to return. The lines can be long and take a while, especially in the drive-thru. There is normally always a bum standing outside asking for money, if you don't see him he is most likely inside taking a break. Overall, this place is decent. If I was hungry and needed a quick bite, I would stop on by.<//Review>< pics>

I spend 40 mins in drive thru to not even get my food because as I was waiting in the drive thru like for 30 min I call the place and manager said sorry that they were trying to get thru the drive thru at quick as possible but no 10 mins later I just put my car in reverse and the 4 cars behind me also reversed out. Dont waste your time going here better driving to another driver thru.... p.s. managers name is Luis Chavez and I feel really bad but posting this but theres no way in hell I'm ever going back to this place horrible horrible service....< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2cec3afd11c51:0x71516d3ea68c41d1<//GmapID></record>

Cmon it's McDonald's, I think it's part of life 101 when you grow up in America. Start off with a happy meal, graduate to a quarter pounder and if you occasionally want to be exotic, you can wait for the mcrib.<//Text>

Best customer service by a young lady, by chassity she's amazing at her job looks like she's really into her work, and dedicated to me needs. Honestly I'd only go back when she's working. Also these polite young men, I think it was Kevin and Fransico, they seemed eager to work.< /Text>

<Text>Im not joking here, I saw a prep cook, while preparing food, poke his nose, while prepping food.  Super slow service, incomplete orders, poor management, no motivation by staff. They should just shut down. Why when you go to In and Out burger, the staff is always at attention, and any poor community McDs, everybody including management have this "hating there job" kinda look.  We the customer can complain all we want, but nothing changes at this McDonalds, nothing.< /Text><rate>1< /rate>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Every time I come to this McDonald’s they never have anything! They should really be more specific with the times they want to serve stuff. For example they never have their ice cream machine on and they stop serving mc cafe menu items after 8 pm. Hmm thought it was 24 hour drive thru disappointed<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Im not joking here, I saw a prep cook, while preparing food, poke his nose, while prepping food.  Super slow service, incomplete orders, poor management, no motivation by staff. They should just shut down. Why when you go to In and Out burger, the staff is always at attention, and any poor community McDs, everybody including management have this "hating there job" kinda look.  We the customer can complain all we want, but nothing changes at this McDonalds, nothing.</Text>< Pics>

The food is your standard McDonald's, with variances based on who's cooking.  They will often meet your special requests, but it's hit or miss sometimes.   They've gotten small things wrong (ie: mayonnaise on a no mayonnaise order).  The manager, Oscar, will do whatever is needed to fix it and have you leave happy.

The WiFi is bad, so don't expect to stream movies or TV shows while connected inside. The bathroom could use work as well.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very expensive hamburgers already want to charge in a combo 1 hour of work, and they put a lot of meat, they do not have smaller options for the big mac, nor do they send coupons like burger king or jack in the box, these restaurants send coupons every month , and they don't have smaller soda options.

<review>(Translated by Google) I come from La Puente and come to Bell City for an errand, in the end I go to breakfast, Mcdonald's on the corner that is fine for breakfast but disappointment or fatal service. It took me more than 20 min to give me my breakfast and then the person who cleaned an old lady, with the complaint, that the drivers what this other, on the side of the windows inside was super dirty .. rare in a McDonald's .. ahsss I said I come to breakfast and relax in the end .. My husband went to the bathroom and for bad luck someone had taken a shower and someone had also dirty the toilet at last, the lady again complained that because she washed the men's bathroom ahhh I said ufff need to find out the annoyance that he does not like his job in the end, then I finish finally cleaning the bathroom, my husband entered there was not. no soap, no paper .... Ahhh what a bad service .. Managers more attention with their employees, employees if they do not like their work let someone who wants to work do it and not be filled with stress just because they are not happy. In their employment and do not let us customers find out about the gossip. Apart from unpleasant is lack of ethics ... The truth is that McDonald's is a shame disaster that is beautiful

Vengo desde La Puente y venia a la Ciudad de Bell a un mandado ,  en fin pase al desayuno ,Mcdonald's en la esquina que bien a desayunar pero o desilusión  servicio fatal. Tardaron para darme mi desayuno mas de 20 min y luego la persona que limpiaba una señora mayor , con la quejadera,  de que los manegadores esto que lo otro, de lado de las ventanas por dentro estaba super sucio ..raro en un Mcdonald's .. ahsss dije vengo a desayunar y relajarme en fin.. Mi esposo paso al baño y para mala suerte alguien se habia echado un Shower y alguien tambien habia ensuciado el escusado en fin , la señora nuevamente se quejo que porque lavaba ella el Baño de los hombres ahhh dije ufff q necesidad de enterarse de la molestia de que no le agrada su trabajo en fin, despues termino por fin de limpiar el baño,  entro mi esposo no habia. ni jabon , ni papel.... Ahhh que mal servicio.. Managers mas atencion con sus empleados, empleados si no les gusta su trabajo dejen que alguien que quiera trabajar lo haga y no se llenen de stress solo porque no son felices. En su empleo y no  dejen q nosotros los clientes nos enteremos del chisme.aparte de desagradable es falta de etica... La verdad este Mcdonald's es un desastre lastima que esta bonito<//review>< Rate>
