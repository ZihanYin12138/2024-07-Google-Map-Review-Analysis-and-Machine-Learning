This was my first time trying wing stop and it wasn't a good impression. The wait time was an hour long and by time I got my food the fries were really cold and soggy. The wings were too crunchy to even enjoy and they were out of all sodas. Not great.<//review>

It’s like they’re scared to sauce up wings or something. Every time I try to give them a chance the wings are lightly sauced and the fries are either always too hard or soggy. Highly recommend going to the Blackstone location instead.</text>

<Text>I made an online order for pickup and when it was time for my pick up the customer service I received was not professional. I was given attitude and I did not have a warm welcoming at all. I went up to ask customer service about my online order, but she gave me a stare and was being rude and said I have to wait in line like the rest of the customers. With no signs or direction I stood inside the store waiting for my order to be called. On the other hand my food was cold and the meat was hard. Will definitely not go back there again.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

My girlfriend picked up an order for me because I live across town keep in mind she drives a v8 truck so these guys can forget half of the order not happy at all they have done this to me at this location twice already very poor service and then when I call them they lie about the manager not being there and they tell me the combo doesn’t come with fries but when I send my girlfriend back to the store they look at my girlfriend like she is lying about some frys totally un professional on so many levels last time I go here< /Review>

<review>Walked in, ordered, surprisingly fast service. We get home, there’s a combo from our order missing, wife goes back. They demand we bring the entire food order back!! Are you serious!!? Because they believe to be correct! I’ve never paid for a service and if your a paying unsatisfied customer you do what it is needed to correct the situation. Not have my family jump through loop holes to give us what we paid for. Rant over! Don’t stop at this wing stop.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80945f2d26a2fa49:0xbc6b23a48f51d4c2</Gmap_id></record>

Bad service! They don't give you what you order and when you call them to complain they day it's your fault since they say they repeat the order when they give it to you but they never do.< /review>

(Translated by Google) They don't answer the phones and when they answer they hang up the call. And they say they are busy and you go to the store and they are not! And they are rude.

No contestan los teléfonos y cuando contestan te cuelgan la llamada. Y dicen que están ocupados y vas a la tienda y no lo están! Y son groseros.<//Text>

<Time>1605552286405<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>I  came in on Sunday afternoon looking to buy the 11 or 12  iPhone model. I was greeted by that staff;  Kimberly the sales rep got me registered and was available to help me right away. I had a lot of questions but thankfully she was able to guide me on what would be the best phone and what accessories offer the best protection. I will definitely be coming back to this store for the new IWATCH.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0c92e9c0001:0x71d05d2618f15cc7</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Came for a concern that I had and Adolfo really helped me out. He went out of his way to make sure I was content. Such great customer service. Will definitely be coming back and recommending people to this store. Everyone is really nice and friendly. Big shout out to the manager Franc who also assisted me and made me feel like family. Originally, I came in unhappy from another store, but Adolfo and Franc really made my day. I wish I would've came here from the start. Thank you guys for your help!<//text><rate>5< /rate>< gmapID>

I wanted to write this review months ago after my visit when the store was brand new. I'm finally getting it done!

I had the assistance and expertise of the entire staff when I stopped by this location after work one Saturday afternoon soon after their store's debut in this neighborhood. One salesperson in particular,  (I actually think he was a manager) spent time with me, answering my every question with knowledge and utmost patience. He took the time to get to know what I wanted in a tablet and encouraged me to make a choice that I'm happy with.  Even though it meant I spent less money, it was a better choice for what I needed in my device.

I was definitely impressed with the knowledge of each person working here and with the enthusiasm everyone had for their job.</review>

My pre pay phone was stolen, so I had to replace it. I went to another store first for advice about the best options but wasn't satisfied. I then decided to visit the Hyperion Ave store and was served by Jason who was brilliant - He went through all the various options one by one and worked out the best deal. Thanks!< /Text>

<Review>I am in this small market almost daily and I will continue to get most of the convenience items that I buy from this market and I don't get it why I don't like the idea of having to go to the bigger stores in my area so I can get treated like a criminal but I will go to the market for a new roll of toilet paper and I will be able to get treated like a good friend and that's why I will be there at the market for a new jug of milk or whatever it is you want to get it done by the employees. I am so impressed with the way they treat you like a neighbor who is a close friend of the family. I am so glad that you  can get in and out of the market quicklyand your wallet is not going to get hit hard there either.<//Review>< Time>

<Text>This place smells like a hamster cage and there are always unfortunate people randomly milling about outside asking for money. The staff is nice if you get to know them but the store is only good for a quick stop if you need toilet paper and a bag of doritos.< /Text><time>1520235780977<//time>< rating>

The store is small and very crowded inside, the staff is friendly. Unfortunately the neighborhood is deplorable, the parking lot is full of degenerates and junkies (scary). It's sad to see the place where I grew up gone to pot.< /Text>

Fitness 19 is probably the best family friendly gym I have been too. I’m able to take my children to the day care and not have to worry about them. It’s a clean environment with up-to-date equipment.< /Review>

I used to like coming here until I couldn’t stand the smell anymore. Started going to the one off bear valley, much cleaner and newer.  The staff doesn’t seem very happy to be here. I’ve had memberships at other big gyms such as LA fitness and 24 and they were always so welcoming and always someone at the front to greet you, but not here. Even if they’re at the front desk they just watch you pass on by. Oh and the short Hispanic buff looking girl is the worst. She doesn’t only look like she has a bad attitude but while I was changing in the dressing room (because they don’t have locker rooms, they have 2 individual dressing rooms) she unlocked the door and tried to go in. I mean you would think right if the door is locked someone is in there? Yeah she knocked and I responded I’m in here. Maybe she didn’t hear me cause the music is so damn loud, but she still with the key unlocked the door and tried to go in. Not just once but twice. After that I refused to come back. I enjoy working out I liking going to the gym just not this one</review>

Magnificent gym. Large isolated class room, plenty of weights and machines. Friendly and welcoming staff. Good selection of pre workout and energy drinks to get you going before your workout. I love this gym so much.<//review>

Class schedule is not the best. Used to have a Saturday Zumba but it got cancelled and the Friday Zumba teacher always is late! This is not a good signal to the paying members. Also the online class schedule is never correct and they tell you to take a picture of the schedule posted with your phone. Therefore you never have an updated schedule. 24 hour fitness in Apple Valley is more responsible with their classes!< /Text>

<text>It's over crowded because the staff doesn't monitor people checking in. I've watched herds of people walk in without scanning.
The other problem is little kids are running around playing on the machines you need to finish your work out. One little 10 year old ass hole told a member that confronted him "I'm a teenager"<//text>< pics>

<Review>I love this gym!  It is clean, open, airy...has all the equiptment you could need..machines, free weights, kettle bells, treadmills, ellipticals....I've even takens classes!  The staff is really helpful, especially when I get in those ruts with my routine, and the hours are great...I like to have the option of early morning AND late at night.

I've been to some of the other gyms in the High Desert and was not impressed. They either were dark and had a closed in feeling or stunk of chlorine from (dirty) pools....no thanks!

Oh, and the BEST part...this gym plays classic rock and roll a lot!!!  I get a MUCH better cardio workout with some Van Halen and Stones!!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The woman who helped me was wonderful, her name was Wendy. She needs a raise. When I called in I spoke to someone named Terry. Horrible. Rude. Cut me off. Didn't understand. Unhelpful. Rushed me to get off the phone and even hung up before I could respond with my next question. God help you if you get Terry. Never again</Text>

<Text>Love the Debit card payment option! My family and I have been renting cars with them for almost a year now and we’ve had pretty good experiences with the cars and customer service. Should there be any problems, I’ve had them resolved pretty quickly and efficiently thru Hertz (Because I was told they are operating under Hertz). Wendy, the Dollar Car Rental rep. at the now Hertz desk due to Covid, is such a great help! Super efficient and understanding! Also, Terri as well! As long as the Debit card payment is available, my family and I will continue to rent cars!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Made a reservation in advance then when I got there the office was closed. Never notified of them closing early. Then Hertz tried to help even though they didn't have a midsized car. Very unhappy with the customer service... as a whole rude at the counter and on the phone... not to mention the car had dings dents and scratches on every side of the car... 😡😡😡 plus they double charge a week after your return...😡😡😡</Text>

<review>I didn't have a credit card, they dont accept ATM/credit cards. I remember a time when I used ATM/credit cards. And it wasnt mentioned during the phone conversation, before we went there. So it was an inconvenience, not to mention, that I'm disabled, and its difficult to get around.</review><rating>2<//rating>< username>

i booked online for pick up tonight and after i paid for it online and recieved the email confirmation it wasnt the same pick up. i called customer service at the airport and since i paid with a debt card it changed the pick up date. i should have not been allowed to check out and pay for it online if i wasnt allowed to pick it up tonight. i had an emergancy situation and my car broke down and i needed a rental. and to make matters worse now i have to wait a week to a week and a half to get my money back from you guys this has been the worst experience ever. i even checked the website to see if there was any restrictions for debt card payors and didnt find anything but the two forms of id and a security deposit needed which i was totally ok with doing.<//Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>Very dirty car. They hadn't cleaned it in months. Found a wedding invite from April!  The corporate, not location, messed up my charges.
The 1st vehicle they tried to give me, at the same price as the one I requested, was 4x smaller!  I refused and requested the proper size I paid for. Then got the dirty one. Can't win. Oh well. At least they allow debit card rental.<//text>< pics>

It's companies like this that make ppl hate capitalism. They reserved a car for me by phone, I know using debit rather than credit has more requirements so I made sure to ask the day I was to pick up my rental, if I had everything I needed so that I didn't get there and run into problems, I made a special call specifically for that reason just b4 leaving my house-by way of Uber, so the ride to Dollar Rental cost me money- and the phone rep (who sounded possibly Indian, which means they enjoy 3rd world cheap labor) said yes, u have everything u need, u will be fine. I get there and the counter person  informed me that bcuz I used my debit card rather than a credit card, they impose a rule that the reservation has to stand for 24 hrs b4 they'll release the rental car, i was 5 hrs early and would have to wait 5 more hrs! By which time it would be 5pm and there would be no reason to even pay to have the car for that day. I was forced to cancel it all together and take another Uber to Enterprise (across town, $12 more) who took great care of me. I also realized that the phone agent who made my reservation allowed me to make a reservation to pick up the car 16 hrs after I'd made the reservation, even tho the company has a policy that it won't let u pick up the car until it's been 24 hrs! So either she was terribly trained and had no knowledge of company rules, or she intentionally hustled me by hoping that I would wait the 5 hrs then pay for a day that I only had the car for a few hrs of, i.e. pay for all of Friday yet only actually have the car from 5pm on. I will NEVER rent from them as long as I live and I will tell this story to ANYONE who's thinking about renting from them, then I'll recommend Enterprise! I CAN'T STAND SHADY COMPANIES!</review>

It's best you ask questions before you check out because almost with ALL rental places, they never explain the insurance details. I have learned so many things by asking so there is no surprises later. Also, read the fine print on your rental agreement. Please don't judge the staff, they are different staff than calling the 800 number.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80945e98e4d7a5ab:0xf9440d2fd83d8e8d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I was dropping the car off before the office opened and wanted to call the local office to speak with someone about getting a receipt with a $0 balance.  All I could find (even on-line) was a toll number which was always busy and no matter which optioned I selected, I was told (by that damn automated voice) that all lines were busy and to call back; and then I was disconnected.  Why can't Dollar have a local phone number for their offices where I can speak to a human.  I will not use Dollar again.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1560600879818, 'text': "Good morning Scott!

<Text>I reserved on-line, had no problems at all. Customer service was fine, and the Fresno airport is so easy to get in and out of. I was amazed that they gave me the key, I walked a few steps outside, found my car and drove away. Not even a gate to pass through on my exit. So pleasant compared to my experience at big airports. And I loved the Chevy Sonic.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80945e98e4d7a5ab:0xf9440d2fd83d8e8d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Poor customer service. No communication between the people you speak with and the people onsite. Trying to exchange a horrible car, get here after speaking with someone on the phone, and they offer me the exact same car. And won’t give me the number to speak with them directly! I have to keep calling the number that sends me in circles...< /Review>

It was all well and good until we wanted to extend our rental. Then they wanted to charge us twice as much for less days than we originally rented the car, add on another deposit (even though they were already holding $350.00), and add on an extra 35% airport tax. We returned the car and rented from Enterprise. We will never rent from Dollar Rent A Car again.< /Text>

Booked via Expedia, price after tax and collision damage was $226 for 3 days and 7 hours. I was charged $306 with several miscellaneous charges and a late fee ( no idea why?). None of these were disclosed by Expedia or Dollar before renting.</Text>

I really did not like the customer service over the phone. The representative kept asking if I want a reservation. I told him straight up right at the beginning that I do want one. I would like to ask for the rate. Also, I didn't like the way he talked to me. He didn't sound polite.<//review>

<text>Used my free vouchers for 2 days. Got charged $48.28.

The cashier said it was tax but she lied. It wasn't. It was some return change fee which I wasn't liable for. She refunded $39.28. Now I checked my credit card and there's a pending charge of $43.

No wonder they got sued and lost.

Stupid cashier lied to me and tried to cheat. Bad bad bad!!!!!!< /text>< pictures>

I got hung up on twice when I called trying to work out a situation that happened at Fresno airport dollar rental.  I was told the manager would call me first thing last Monday morning and no one called and I was told my reservation wouldn't close until they spoke to me and today I found out they closed it and the manager never called!  There was a strong foul odor in the vehicle which I come to find out is a pesticide.  It gave me a headache for two days and the smell was so bad I had to ask for a new car the following two days.  Someone needs to be responsible for renting a car that's not suitable for driving in.  I am told customer service is closed on Saturday!?</Review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>This locations staff is inept to handle car rentals, returned car with full tank of gas and check it in. 12 days later I'm still being charged for car rental. My credit card was charged 5 times from DOLLAR CAR RENTAL.
This is fraud!  I've called every single department on the 1800 number with no one having the capacity to close ticket or find out what is going on. All I can say is that FRESNO location are a bunch of crooks and corporate is right along with them........I guess that's why it's FRESNO!<//Review>< Time>

They told me in the phone I could add an additional driver without a credit card, but the guy at the desk wouldn't do it. I called customer service and asked to talk to a manager, they put me on hold for 10 minutes, picked up the phone, and him up on me. I paid in advance, so I'm screwed. Don't use Dollar!</Text>

<review>I had a problem with a car that I rent here, the car was in good conditions, I almost got an accident in a freeway with my family due to mechanical failures, I was waiting for 5 hours in the street, it was cold, there were two baby for road assistance, but they never told me the true and they couldn’t get me a replacement car after 15 hours, it’s ridiculous, nobody has given to me an explanation about the in convince, they didn’t give me a compensation and I spent money getting a hotel among other stuffs.The clerck the, Wendy B., couldn’t help me and the supervisor, Phillips, never talk to for an explanation, they charge things that I never authorized.BAD SERVICE, THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT THE COSTUMERS.DON’T RENT THERE.</review>< gmapID>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I called last week around 4:00  pm which was near closing time but was still during office hours and I would have called earlier but that's when we noticed my boyfriend's dog getting worse so I called  and explained my boyfriend's  dog was panting heavily and was occasionally making choking like noises and the receptionist asked how long has this been happening and I said it started a couple days prior but we noticed it had got a lot worse and that we were worried and I was told there was about a two week wait that I would be  better off calling the vet clinics in Visalia to possibly get her in  quicker and the receptionist did not mention  that if we feel it's an emergency they will take walk ins because we were ready to take her right than and since the work day was ending we knew we.wouldn't have made it to Visalia before closing time so decided we'd take her first thing in the morning.

Around mid night we noticed my boyfriend's beloved fur baby's health decreasing even more.so I was looking up 24 hour emergency vet hospitals which I did not see any for Porterville and I found two on google in Visalia and called.the phone numbers from the website.and.one of the phone numbers directed me to  a furniture stores voice mail  and the other phone number was making fax line noise and  Stella (my boyfriend's beloved fur baby) passed away while we were trying to get her to an emergency vet hospital when we would have taken her right away if I was told that Henderson vet hospital took walk ins if we felt it was an emergency rather than tell me I'd be better off calling Visalia to get her in quicker after me explaining her symptoms.

I don't know whether or not Stella  could have been treated because we still don't know why this was happening to her but it's possible she could still be here with us today if I knew that Henderson vet hospital would take walk ins for emergencies as stated on the website which  I did not get the number from the website so I did not know, nor, was I told when I called.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>It’s not completely bad, but i would definitely not recommend. my pup got spayed and when I dropped her off I was going to let her know i’ll be back (like i always do when i leave her anywhere) and the staff just pulled her away. Once I went to pick her up, when the vet was talking to us she seemed very fearful and wary of him. I asked the lady at the front desk if I could get pain medication for her, she said no, that she wouldn’t need it. She got one of her organs taken out and you’re telling me she’s not going to need pain medication?! (also the receptionists didn’t have masks, not even the vet!)<//Text>< Resp>

<review>Outstanding and very courteous staff. Take great pride in giving amazing service to our dogs and you can always call for advice or with questions they are not pushy about sales and always give you choices. Parking is a bit limited but well worth it. Never had a bad incident with them and our pets always come home happy.</review>< Date>

I am not sure I would take my animal back to this place again unless I had to. My dog used to be excited going to the vet in GA, partially because they did an excellent job handling her and partially because she’s an excitable dog that just loves to go anywhere. I took her to this vet once while I had her with me in CA. They boarded her all day (85$ fee) for a vaccination that would take less than five minutes to give. Inconvenient, but whatever. However, upon returning to GA and her next visit to her old vet she had extremely different behavior- shaking, obvious fear of the vet or handlers, constant pacing, panting and slobbering everywhere. I can’t say with certainty that Henderson vet did anything wrong because I wasn’t able to witness any of their interactions with her since I was told to drop her off and leave her all day, but my dog is now traumatized about going to the vet. If you have a sensitive animal, I would probably avoid this hospital.< /text>

I have had my animals with Doctor Sheer for 25 + years. I had not had a pet when I went there and he patiently showed me as well as told me what to do for my new puppy. Over the years I have come to trust his skill as well as his integrity. I would recommend this practice and Dr. Sheer to anyone who wants a caring, honest and skilled veterinarian to help their beloved pets. He will tell you the truth and his compassion extends to the owners as well as the animals in his care. You will never find a more helpful, caring and efficient animal hospital than Henderson Veterinary Hospital.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Great place! We've fixed a couple dogs and our cat here, and brought other dogs to receive care. The prices are affordable, and the staff is helpful. The vet answers your questions well, and when you call they are able to answer your questions regarding pricing over the phone too. I know what the other reviews mean by the older receptionist woman being rude lol but she's a lot more polite and less judgmental now. The staff and vet are very friendly too.
The waiting area has seating, along with more seating available in a covered/shaded area outside.</review>< pictures>

Very rude older lady. Didn't want to give my doberman care even though he had a halter and muzzle. The young vet tech was nice and he handled my boy. The blonde lady in the front was also nice, however i do not want to return because of the older lady.<//text>

Vet is great. The older ladies like to make you feel bad. Was up all night with my pup she was throwing up. The lady asked if I had her vaccines. Told her she had her first 3-1. She snapped and told me that's not all her shots. Vet was great. Girls need to help people instead of run them down.<//review>

<review>At first I was very pleased. They got my cat seen quickly(at least faster than anywhere else). I did not like the fact that I never got to see them interact with my cat nor did I evee even see the vet or speak to him. My baby has SEVERE epilepsy and because of it was aggressive. They had to sedate him and draw blood. When i got him back his paw was terribly bloody and swollen but at least they gave me meds to stop his seizures. I needed to bring him back 3 weeks later for blood level test. They told me it had to be exactly 6 hours after he takes his pill. Well it takes them almost 30 min to get the blood so when i brought him back 6 hrs later they said it was too late, so why not tell me 5 1/2 hrs? He ran out of pills before his next appt and they made a big deal about the blood test wont be acurate cause he missed doses but they cant gibe him more pills without the blood test. So now he is seizing again and they say its been too much trouble and they will no longer see him. Mind you my baby has the worst epilepsy they have ever seen and their advice to me was " good luck"?

Dr. Scheer is the most caring and phenomenal veterinarian, he truly loves his patients and the their families.  The staff has always been helpful and very polite.  Our precious dog that we had the privilege of having for almost 15 years passed away today, yes we knew it was coming, and Dr. Scheer was so compassionate and helpful.  We will be forever grateful  to him and his wife for going out of their way to help us through this difficult time.  The world could use more compassionate people like these two wonderful people.  Thank you for being there for us and for all of your patients.  We don't know what we would do without Henderson Veterinary Hospital!</text>

<rate>2< /rate><text>Our family dog (a large breed) had a chronic ear ache.  Rather than allow us to come in and attend an appt. with him, we were told we had to leave our dog for the day with the clinic.  We left him with the clinic approx. 8:20am, and were told we could pick him up at about 4:00pm.  At 1:30 the clinic called, and said that they needed permission to sedate our dog, (when permission had already been signed off that morning).  At 2:30, the clinic called again, and told us that although they had sedated our dog, they could not work with him, and asked us to come and pick him up.  Upon arrival, we found our dog in a very small cage, that smelled of vomit, he acted scared, yet happy to see us.  We asked them why they didn't use a muzzle to examine our dog.  The response was, , "We forgot to."  That is not only unprofessional, but uncaring.  Also, if my dog had been properly sedated for his size, weight, etc., he would not have been able to walk out with us so easily.  Any knowledgeable, experienced veterinarian hospital should know how to properly sedate a dog according to their size.  Our dog went home with no medicine, with his ear still aching, and to our surprise a mouth injury due to an apparent struggle with someone at the clinic (ie. rope, leash, etc) as per what we were told by one of the clinic employees.  We will never use or recommend this clinic for pets again.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Horrible service
Today October 10, 2017 I went to this place to treat my pet and I was attended by a woman with a very rude and racist manner to the extent that she denied me the service for no reason simply because of my Hispanic appearance! I can't believe that people have so much hatred for other people just because of their skin color ...
i would like to advise about this lady and if you have the same opinion about the bad service pass it on ...
i don't know how she get this job.
Horrible service.

Hoy 10 de octubre del 2017 fui a este lugar para tratar a mi mascota y me atendió una mujer con una manera muy grosera y racista al grado que me negó el servicio por ninguna razón simplemente por mi aspecto hispano! No puedo creer que la gente tenga tanto odio hacia otras personas solo por el color de piel...

SoCal Magic is one of the better stores in Orange County for your MTG needs. On large tournament days the shop utilizes the extra rooms at the complex to flex their capacity. The owner Paul was very welcoming. Definetly worth checking out if you are a Magic player!< /text>

A great Magic shop. The owners are very friendly and helpful. They know Magic like the back of their hands. They host Friday Night Games for Magic The Gathering every Friday. They also have a little candy selection in case you get hungry while you're here. Parking can be a bit of an issue at times though.</text>

A fun little shop that plays magic the gathering events, great for meeting and playing with new people and the events are ran cleanly. Prices on card singles are par for other shops if not more fair. Their supplies are the correct price and very well stocked. Overall a solid experience for anyone looking to be involved with the Magic the gathering community or the tabletop gaming community period< /review>

I have always loved this magic shop. The staff are so friendly and I never feel strange walking into the shop. Other shops I have gone to made my sister and I feel unwelcomed but this place always greets us. My sister and I havent been here in at least 2-3 years and right when we walked in we were greeted with "wow long time no see! How are you girls doing? Still living in the High Desert?" Their prices are always fair and you can tell that they love what they do. This is by far my favorite shop in all of California. Wish I lived closer,but still make the hour+ drive just to come here. 💖💖💖< /text>

Cash only.  Pack prices just raised to $3.50 and 3 for $10.00.  Decent singles selection with slightly high prices.  Great service.  This is a community hub.  D&D is supported along with most if not all MTG events.<//Text>

Has just about everything magic you would need. Went for my first time a week or two ago and it was great. There were even people playing magic out front! Great atmosphere. Only con is that it is a little hard to spot if its your first time going there.<//text>

Only drawback, really, is that it's cash only. But as long as you remember that going in, its a great little place. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, interesting mix of people playing a variety of games.</text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>The setup of this place is pretty interesting as their playspace is across the beezeway in the shopping center. Lots of space though.  They have a deep selection of Magic the Gathering and D&D products.

The ownership is definitely invested in their customers and stays pretty well informed about what's going on in the area. Very tight retail space, but they are trying hard to maximize it.

Have to say that their location can be hard to locate if you're looking for an overhead sign or something at night.  Their signage is practically non-existent and not well lit at night.

Also be aware that parking and the main entrance is in the back.<//Text>< pictures>

The don't accept Credit/Debit. They claim it is much easier, but I think that's just lazy. It will probably take you 1 hour of waiting while they price the cards. With that said, there is a good selection if you are looking for something obscure, and the staff is relatively friendly.<//Review>

< Review>
I go here for Magic. It is open most days of the week. It is closed on Tuesdays. I usually am playing or buying cards. They have a huge selection of cards to buy from. You can call and ask if they have certain cards and it can placed on hold for you. The place operates cash only. The card are usually $0.25 and up. They sell some food if you get hungry while you are in a tournament. They have draft, commander and standard tournaments; sometimes it happens only on some days or there are not enough people, so it might be best to call in advance. The players are always changing, but some of the reoccurring players can be a bit more competitive than others.
I know that at this location there are Yu-gi-oh events and Dungeons and Dragons. I do not think the people at this shop do either of those, but there is adjacent shops within the same area.
There are bathrooms available. The women's restroom is always locked, so you need to ask for the key. It's a nice place. The workers are very nice and accommodating.<//Review>

Every format you can think of is played here on a regular basis. Great for vets of the game and n00bs alike, the atmosphere is is the most inviting I've ever been to (even my wife, an honest-to-God female, likes coming here). Their pricing is competitive for a LGS and they have a good stock of Standard and Modern staples. Additionally, they are very friendly to gamers of all kinds, offering plenty of board games for anyone to enjoy, free of charge. If you're looking for a new store to play at, just want to get into the tournament scene or are just curious about the game, I HIGHLY recommend stopping bye for a chat with Paul (the owner). He can (and will) talk Magic with anyone and always makes you feel welcomed. A+++++++++++++++++!!!!!!!</Review>< pictures>

<text>Great card shop, spacious play areas. Only draw back is that they are cash only, which only needs some prep and it's not a big deal.< /text></record>

<text>First of all, when you run a card shop all of your employees should know that one of their duty's will include pricing cards for potential buyers. I should not be treated like I am Inconveniencing the store asking for a a variety of prices.

Secondly, why are there price tags on any of the card in the showcase? When I asked to purchase a couple of cards for the asking price, I had to wait 5 minutes for them to check the prices online. When they finally were done figuring out the price Paul the owner added a few dollars on to each cards asking price.

Thirdly, I understand that the shop has had some recent THEFT issues however that is no reason to treat me as though I personally robbed the store. I was unable to browse with any enjoyment because I was constantly barraged by questions like  "whats the EXACT card you are looking for in the set so i can check for you" when I was having a hard time remembering what I wanted from the set.

Last of all I would like to compliment the impressive collection of foils the shop has to offer, and I am sure that the collection of foils will never be sold due to how horribly overpriced they are. If you have a stack of twenty or more foils I wouldn't be asking 3-10 dollars over the standard price of the internet that they need to check for absolutely every purchase.<//text><Rating>1< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Was in town on pre-release weekend (Gatecrash) and they were super accommodating to allow us to play in their pre-release. Really nice staff and awesome customers, a fun gaming experience, great relaxed atmosphere. Really well organized and well run tournament. Pricing of singles was inline with everywhere else and had one of the biggest selections I have ever seen.< /Review><name>Kathryn Allison</name></record></dataset><record>

Great location! Grab your poke and go sit on the beach is perfect! Their topping selection was great and they didn't skimp one the fish like most poke places do! Fish tasted super fresh and their toppings as well! Nice that it came with a side salad as well! You get a great amount of food for what you pay for!</review>

We stumbled upon this place on the way to the pier in Newport. Great service and delicious food. We ordered the ramen (good), shrimp gyoza (good), and fire crunch roll (loved).< /Text>

Amazing place for Poke and Ramen everything is loaded with flavor and is super fresh. A perfect little restaurant right outside of the heart of Balboa village. If you are visiting stop by and grab some deluxe Hawaiian food</Review>

Delicious food, the agua fresca are delicious and big. Great costumer service. Molcajete is also delicious and I recommend to try it out. Place gets full and sometimes food takes a while but is worth the wait.</Text>

I went there and ordered a burrito on 1/29/21 and when I was driving and started eating the food and the beans smelled like they were going bad. I had this food before and it was great 3 years ago but, very disappointed.< /Text>

<review>Excellent authentic Mexican food! They have tacos, tortas, burritos, and of course chips and salsa! This place is a nice little venue with a family oriented vibe. Its operrated by a sweet lady that Im assuming is the owner who also delivers the food to the table which is really nice of her. This place sticks out to me because they have good prices, great food and great service! One of the better family owned places in Anaheim.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) THE NARANJITO. For my taste one of the best alternatives to eat RICO CLEAN AND AT REASONABLE PRICES.
Excellent service by the waiters, or their owner, very friendly and bilingual.
Fast service and for now only take out. Specialists in traditional Mexican food ... they also offer many SPECIALS every day of the week ..
Very familiar ... 😷😁😋😋👍

IMO.😀 Young girl running the event on this day was awesome; kept all volunteers engaged at all times. Tomatoes/oranges was the product at hand..Different working stations assignments was key, and every tasked was perfectly timed. Well organized all around. Not easy labor for sure, but great rewarding satisfaction of doing a good deed for others afterwards. Check it out.👍😀< /Review>< Pics>

They gave us statistics about the food crisis in America and in San Diego. The staff is very well organized super sweet and helpful. I will definitely be back to do some volunteer work on my days off with this company. They're doing great things for the world and San Diego.<//text>< pictures>

Doing great things for the community. Easy to sign up and help package food, provides gloves, water and some refreshments after your shift. Honestly kind and really bring volunteers to help out the community. Easy place for community service hours and coming back is always lots of fun. Only problem would be that it's hard to find using other GPS but Google maps is accurate.<//text>

One of the best volunteer job I did. We sorted out Nectarine/ peaches/ plums in 4lb and 1 lb bags for delivery to local schools the next day. The staff explained who benefits from this distribution which was quite humbling to hear. I recommend this place for people who have the heart to volunteer time for a good purpose.</text>

<Text>They are super friendly! I went there to donate food about 6 months ago.
I went in today to get food. The people that helped me are very awesome. I urge others to go if they are in need of food. They help out immensely!
Thank you so much!<//Text></record>

I have seen been to many food banks across the country.  This is one of the best organized ones I have seen. I was particularly impressed with their efficient distribution of the food they receive to the pantries and people that need it.

Most of the food banks I have seen drone on and on about how large their warehouse is to store all their food.Feeding America San Diego has a totally different approach. They understand that rapidly and efficiently distributing the food they receive is their main purpose. They are the only food bank in America that I have toured that is actually considering moving to a smaller space. They would use this savings to provide better services  to the pantries they serve. I smile every time I think of their operation.</review>

I've been volunteering at Feeding San Diego at least weekly for nearly six years.  What keeps me going back week after week?  A sense of purpose, the feeling of accomplishment and appreciation.  All the projects that get done by volunteers help SO many different people who are food insecure in the county.  Many shifts involve gleaning produce for the many different programs that FSD serves.  Processing food donations from food drives and store donations is also a big part of the what FSD does.  There are a lot of different tasks that need to get done all year round that requires lots of volunteers to keep costs down.  Because of volunteers, FSD monetary donations provide 4 meals for every dollar.  Plus there's a lot of fine people who work and volunteer there. If you want to make a difference in your community helping many people like military families, seniors, kids, and other families who don't have enough to afford all the essentials in their life (1 out of 8 in San Diego), this is the place to spend some of your time at.</text>

Denny's fall brook CALIFORNIA,very good little restaurant in fallbrook, very good food professional staff, family-friendly environment and great family atmosphere at the corner of main and fallbrook street inside fallbrook mercantile shopping center with major market across from meineke auto repair center and windmere real estate,
Highly recommended.</Review>

< review>
Only had one problem here when this Mexican lady called me up to her line when she was still busy while everyone behind me went to other lines and were finished before she started with me. When I said something she spoke Spanish to a lady and she wasn't very nice.  I understood her and called her on it. She doesn't represent  the store very well.</review>

<review>Believe it or not this is owned by Kroger that is found on the East Coast. Store was clean they do sanitation, barriers, masks as per covid-19 requirements. However the customer service line was a bit long I wish they had two registers and two employees handling that other than that it was a pretty good experience.</review><Time>1611265828402</Time><user_id>116486919727076379496<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Good selection of shops for groceries. There's Wallmart neighborhood market, Discount Grocery & Sprouts. I was surprised to find that Walmart was less expensive than Sprouts on the produce & equally the produce was fresh in both stores.</review>

<review>Business as usual! Depending on where you're shopping, the parking is terrible. As in there isn't much. And ppl there don't know how to park to begin with. Still, as always, alot of homeless.

<review>I'm so glad they put this store in here. Although Walmart is in the same shopping center Smart n Final has things and deals you can't get from other stores.  Their produce and meats are excellent.  Highly recommend</review>< Pictures>

Normally I don't love a grocery store, but when compared to other S&F's, this one is nice. It's a little bit larger and there are extra departments, like a bakery and fresh food areas. The employees I dealt with were friendly and helpful as well, which goes a long way...< /Review>

yes there are homeless but I have been shopping there for over 20 years so have most of my friends. And I have never had any problems they also have security as well as secretary cameras in the parking lot. Seriously the homeless there are not a problem.</Review>

<review>This area in Alpine has something for everyone. We have Baron's Market known for it's farm fresh produce,and healthy food items, Kahoots has everything for your pets, plus super nice employee's always willing to help. Don't forget Ace Hardware . A life saver when you "have to have" that certain item to finish a job. Add a few places for a cold beer and a good meal and the area is complete!!< /review></record>

<review>We call it Walmart on the "Hill." Car services, indoor restaurant, kyacts, restroom. Also, over night parking for motorhomes etc., at no cost to you!!!

The staff were friendly and helpful.  They welcome everyone as they pass by and offer to help, which made me shopping easier.  When the line got too long they quickly opened another one.  I was able to be in and out in a timely manner.</Text>

I like this store. I'd like to have the prices a bit cheaper on certain items. Employees are so friendly and welcoming here which is a main reason I continue to shop here. I just wish they had all the items I need to only make one stop.< /text>

This is whete my FAVORITE  UPS store is located.  I have never had any problems with my packages getting to where they should go. And thier "box making" skills rival my own (packed mail order for the 1st/original PETCO, vack in the day!) Why pay for a too large box when one can be it down to fit just right! Always friendly and the owner is a sweetheart!<//review>

It's kind of out in the middle of nowhere, but I get the point. There's going to be a lot of building going on out there, so soon it'll all be built up.  It's fairly new, really, and very beautiful.  Very spacious and hallelujah, not crowded!  Enjoyed it very much!</review>

< Review>
It's just a little strip mail with Wells Fargo,  Panda Express,  Subway, H & R block,  UPS Store, Smart & Final, Sally Beauty Supply and maybe I'm missing a store or 2 but it's situated across the parking lot from Walmart which I pick up a lot of staple groceries at,  and other necessities as I need them.  The parking lot is rarely if ever, filled up.  Worst case scenario, you might just have to walk a little bit.</Review>

Good selection of shops that are well needed in the area. Seems like a gym is taking the place of what used to be Payless Shoe Source.< /Review>

There is also a Starbucks inside the newly remodeled Albertsons. Fantastic Sams affords you a nice haircut from talented staff, a smoke shop with a wonderful owner. You can even get your water bottles refilled here. There is a Greek chicken place, but I've not been there yet, I've heard good things though. Give this place a look-see, you won't be disappointed.</text>< Name>

A one stop shop for you, no need to run around looking for all kinds of needs. Very convenient location, easy parking, easy access to main streets. I recommend this location highly.<//Text>

Nice little shopping center that has little shops and restaurants. There's also a Walmart and Smart and Final there as well. So far, the customer service and satisfaction is guaranteed and very good. I recommend this little shopping center..to everyone.</review>

Visiting from mid West, the maintaince of this store is great right from the parking lot. It was a quick checkout for us, good selection of foods available and getting charged for the Walmart bags was surprising.< /Text>

<review>No parking lot security.  Restaurant options include: subway.  The Radio Shack closed up shop and the remaining stores are stale.  UPDATE:  place looks like they never have trash pickup.  Why does Google ask if there are public bathrooms here?  This isn't that kind of place, it's a strip mall with a Wal-Mart.</review>< Time>

It's a shopping center. Has Walmart, Smart and Final Express, Panda express,  UPS store, Sally's beauty supply, Payless shoes, and Massage  Envy.

However I really miss having a Vons right there. Smart and Final is great but seems to be geared toward food service industry. (Wanna be Sam's Club or Costco). Miss the Starbucks inside the Vons that I miss.

Come back Vons pppppplllllleeeease!< /text>

I love to shop here, I buy things at Smart and Final and things at Walmart, in the interim if I'm hungry Subway's soup and sandwich combo is perfect for my family.
I've even had to (in desperation) visited Sally's cosmetics (which never has products for black women!), to get hair products I needed immediately. Also Payless is there and has good sales on socks and purses that my daughter can use and if she looses them, I never really mind,because they were inexpensive.
And the view is everything here!!!<//review>

Lots of your neighborhood stores for everyday needs.
There's Walmart, Smart & Final, Subway sandwiches, H&R Block, local dentist (have heard only good things from friends about him).
Lots of Parking for the entire Square; guarded by security.</text>

East county square is the go to place for anyone living in South lakeside or east El Cajon. It doesn't have too many options but what is there are things like Walmart, Vons and a few other food shops and specialty shops such as the H&R block. Plenty of parking here regardless of your Destination. I gave 4 stars rather than 5 due to limited amount of shops and no actual restaurant.</Review>

The Walmart in this area is well stocked, clean, and organized. They have a good selection of grocery items as well. There's a Payless Shoes, as well as a Subway, and Sally Beauty Supply all conveniently located.</text>

This square is were Walmart is located. This is my frequent spot. The prices and the selection is good there.
There is also Payless store on the lot. There selection does differ slightly from other Payless stores.
The other spots that stands out to me are UPS, Massage Envy, Subway, Taco Bell, Sally's Beauty Supply, and Smart and Final.< /Review>

<text>It's convenient right off the 15 with plenty of places to shop like PetsMart & Walmart, and places to eat close by like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Rubio's.

At the same time it is a busy place and can be difficult to park at some of the places.<//text></record></dataset><record>
