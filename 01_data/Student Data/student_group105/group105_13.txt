<Text>Sean, the Property Manager, goes above and beyond to meet his clients' needs.  He is honest, genuine, and does everything he can to be of assistance.  Thanks for seeking me out when a unit size I was interested in became available.  Your diligence and commitment to excellence are very much appreciated.  Keep up the great work!</Text><Date>1510435160119< /Date>< username>

<text>I am very happy renting a storage unit here with Public Storage Cooks Bay. I have been renting a 5×5 unit but needed to upgrade to a larger unit. Working with Kat she advised on what size storage unit I should upgrade too. I strongly recommend renting from this facility. You will be greeted with a warm smile, friendly service, with knowledgeable attendants. Thank you very much Kat and team Public Storage Cooks Bay.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Jonathan was such a pleasure to work with. I was “that” customer who showed up 10 minutes before close and I felt horrible doing so.  Though I was in a pinch to get a storage that night, he was friendly and helpful throughout the whole process. He didn’t make me feel rushed even though I was trying to rush to ensure I didn’t keep him past 6pm - cause I know how that’s like. Thank you SO much for your help Jonathan. Extremely friendly. Great communication. Amazing energy! 😀< /text>< pics>

Public Storage of Lake Forest is the best place to pack your goodies!! Kat is the absolute best to work with and very helpful on finding the right unit for all my different storage needs. She has helped me get into 3 different spaces so far. Best price storage in South OC!!<//Text>

Kat was incredibly helpful and professional throughout the entire process. Process was very smooth and quick! While I reserved my storage space 2 weeks prior to arriving, Kat made sure to confirm twice with me before my arrival and answered all of the questions that I had. Storage unit was clean and easily accessible. Overall, really happy with the experience.</Review>

<Text>Wow.  Kat was amazing.  I own a moving company and was looking for storage in the area for a client.

I’m not sure if this is the cheapest place or not, I haven’t really done the research but really don’t care anymore  after meeting Kat.  Her customer service was so amazing I feel like I’m okay spending whatever just to do business with her.

What a joy 😃

<Text>I must take the opportunity to share my extremely positive experience with my needs & quest for a storage unit, as I needed to “downsize”. I had visited several storage businesses in my area & this location was my last comparison. It was one of our “scorcher days”. 🥵 No one had my preferred size available & I needed a “drive up unit”. This sweet young gal, Kat, was so nice, showed me possible spaces, but none met my needs. She took my cell number & said she would call me, if something became available. Two days later she called to tell me a unit just was vacated that met my needs. She was pleasant & eager to help in anyway. I did not have this experience at other locations. Kat ROCKS! The grounds are impeccably clean. Storage doors are fleshly painted. YAY KAT!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😊<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rate>

Just checked into my unit and Kat was super helpful and actually switched me over to a first floor unit for the same price. I would highly recommend public storage if you are looking to rent a storage unit in the area!< /text>

I have been renting here for years and have always had a pleasant experience, but with my most recent visits and questions, Kat has not only been VERY helpful, and extremely friendly, she is also making sure she is handling everything with COVID to the highest regard with using gloves and face masks!</Review>

<Review>I've been with Public Storage for 30 years and almost ten years at the Foothill Ranch CA location. I recently downsized my unit, dealing with both Sean and Jazz (love them both). Jazz was my point person for this move. She is personal and professional and she made it a smooth and easy transition.  Jazz gives outstanding Customer Service and she makes this location great.</Review>< Rating>

Sean at Public Storage has been a Rick star. He is extremely friendly and did a great job getting my family set up with a storage unit while we were between houses while our new home was being built. Sean took us on a tour of the facility, showed us the unit and get us through the paperwork quickly. I have seen him many times since and he is always so helpful and has a smile on his face. I would highly recommend this for your storage needs and try to meet up with Sean. He is great!<//review>

Sean and his colleagues at this property are top notch! Very customer service oriented and focused on providing the best rental experience possible. I have several family members that have done business with this location over the last 7 years. It is because of their level of service and professionalism that we keep coming back. Keep up the good work Sean!!< /Review>

<Text>Storage is a simple process when people like Sean give you all the info and tools you need to make your transition in life an easier reality by offering great deals,  a good attitude and tools to get the job done.  Tape,  boxes,  stretch wrap (my personal favorite,  keeps drawers in place, combines things, without  sticky tape residue (an underrated product by far !!!).  Sean has it ALL there in the office, where he can offer you an unbeatable move-in special and get you movin' on to greater things.   Whether you need short term or long term storage Public Storage "can do" and Sean with his dapper good looks can expedite that moving thing with a big check mark next to it.  Getter' Done Already,  Sean is ready for your business!!!!<//Text>< GmapID>

I used Public Storage for a couple of years. I just found a house and needed to vacate the space. Sean, property manager, is the nicest and friendliest person that I truly enjoyed to chat with. Property is always clean, well secured, and very conveniently accessible. I would recommend this facility to anyone who’s searching for a storage.< /review>

I had a reservation for 10x30 as I did not know what my needs were. Sean helped me decide what unit work best for me which saved me money on monthly rent nearly by half. He was very attentive, polite, and was willing to show multiple spaces to make sure that I get the right space. Not to mention the cleanliness and security of the space. Thank you<//text>

< Review>
I rented a storage unit with Sean. He was great! Very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. He made the process very easy and smooth. Even though it was my first time renting a unit, I was surprised by how clean the facility was.
When we were moving, one of the pieces of furniture fell of the track and broke. Sean was waking by and was nice enough to give us an access to the dumpster. He explain that typically they don’t allow public dumping but he made this exception for us because he saw how much items we were bringing.
Great customer service Sean!< /Review>

This place is clean, has wide roads, has an area for parking inside the gates, and the inside of the my 5x15 unit has steel walls, so no worries of denting plasterboard. It also has security cameras. Sean was very professional, courteous and provided excellent customer service. It's in a nice area, and I have no complaints or suggestions. Everything went smoothly! Thanks Sean!</Review>

Sean is a rockstar!  From day 1, Sean has been most knowledgeable, courteous, and helpful.  Moving is always stressful, but our storage experience at Public Storage were nearly stress free.   All questions and concerns were handled immediately.  We can not recommend more highly. Thank you, Sean, and keep up the good work!< /Review>

I went in to this location a couple days ago and was greeted pleasantly by Sean, he patiently went over all of the storage options available to me and answered all of my questions. My situation changed and I won’t be needing storage at this time but if and when I do, I will be sure to utilize this facility. I will definitely be recommending this location to friends and family.< /review>

After a year of needing the temporary storage space, all the "stuff" finally found a permanent home and was relocated successfully. This facility was always clean and accessible when needed. Never had any problems at all. Move out day was was made very easy by Jim, the on duty manager who could not have been more helpful, even making sure I was able to complete the final payment process when i messed up the on line account. I will not hesitate to do do business here if the need ever again arises.</Text>

The staff was great on the phone regarding a reservation and then follow up to make sure I got what I wanted and at the price I wanted.  When I went in to sign the paperwork, everyone was incredibly nice and helpful.  I dealt mostly with Khidhar and there was no pushiness, I was treated well, the unit was very nice and clean and the complex looked very clean and safe and secure.  I chose this complex because my nephew, who is a lawyer, has his stuff there and he is quite happy.  I also like the location.</Review>

We have been customers of Public Storage for many years.  We actually have 3 spaces presently at this location.  The customer service from this location is five stars!!!  The staff are so courteous, professional and helpful.

They have gone out of their way to help us.  Tammy, the property manager, most especially has shown us such courtesy.  The property is always clean and  well cared for.  She made sure our storage units were close to each other so we would be easily able to access them.

We highly recommend this location  Steve and Sue Bernritter<//text>

I would recommend this storage facility over any!!! Tammy has always been so helpful and understanding of all our needs. Today, I cleaned out one unit and Sitara was also wonderful and so nice. The place is CLEAN and well cared for...I feel safe here. I still have an inside unit and am so impressed with, again, the cleanliness and security of this storage facility.

After booking a reservation online, I received a call from Ava. A very pleasant lady, who wanted to coordinate my time with the staff to set up a time to see the storage and complete paper work. She was helpful and courteous. The next day, Sitara greeted me and toured me around the facility to my storage room. She was straightforward, professional and has excellent customer service. This is my first time at public storage, and I am impressed with their service. Highly recommend this business in lake forest.</Text>

<Review>Went here today after setting up a reservation.

Jim was very helpful and funny, and really helped me decide upon what I really needed in terms of storage for my possessions.

The process left me very informed about what I need to do to access my unit, and when the location was open, and all my questions were answered.

Great location, I would certainly recommend it!< /Review>< pictures>

The staff was great on the phone regarding a reservation and then follow up to make sure I got what I wanted and at the price I wanted.  When I went in to sign the paperwork, everyone was incredibly nice and helpful.  I dealt mostly with Khidhar and there was no pushiness, I was treated well, the unit was very nice and clean and the complex looked very clean and safe and secure.  I chose this complex because my nephew, who is a lawyer, has his stuff there and he is quite happy.  I also like the location.<//text>

When my husband and I went to our appointment to reserve our Public Storage space, we were greeted promptly by Abdullah the Manager who went over every detail and question we had with professionalism and courtesy. Along with his assistant, Mark, he accompanied us to our space and back to the office where we signed our rental agreement. We couldn't have had better service. In addition, the facility is kept very clean and neat.< /Review>

my experience at Public Storage was outstanding, for my family in a very trying time. Manager Jim is awesome, always smiling and helpful Cathy is delightful, and my experience began with my online reservation, which Robert returned to me with a personal phone call in under 4 hours. the facility is wonderful, accommodating, competitive rates, clean, access hours from 6 am to 9 pm .... i very strongly recommend PS to everybody and anybody needing extra storage; the courtesy and personal touch was amazing. thanks again and God bless you ! the wildings.<//Review>

<Review>Very nice facility, clean and personnel very helpful.
Walked in for info, spoke with Jana, she answered all my questions.
Went online to make reservation and immediately got call from Jana to verify appointment time for move-in.
Arrived late for move-in and Abdullah explained all paperwork and showed us to our unit and instructed us about access codes and online payment processing.

I was at Public Storage in Lake Forest,  This place is awesome!.  Two of staff Abdullah and Catie are super kind  and friendly and very polite and professional. Also my storage space is very clean and  very good secured.
I would like to recommend this location for everyone who is looking for storage space near this location . Please don't go other company,
must go Public Storage.

<review>Rented a 10'x20' unit from September to November and utilized the $1 for the first month deal.  The paperwork was quick and the staff was incredibly helpful.  Abdullah and Sitara were very informative, and even stayed a little bit past their shift to make sure we vacated on time and without any penalties.  The unit was clean and there was plenty of space to move around other patrons.  I would recommend this facility, and will definitely use it again in the future.</review></record></dataset><record>

We having been using this public storage for as long as I can remember and the staff has never let us down. Abdullah is excellent and always helpful. I feel like the facility is very clean compared to other storeage facilities I've been to. Keep up the good work guys! :)< /Review>

Jim was awesome in helping us decide on what is the appropriate unit. His suggestions were taken. It was definitely a surprisingly friendly and professional approach to customer relations.</Text>

The staff Abdullah and Tif were very helpful and experienced in getting what I need to make my move easier. Maybe a little too helpful... they do try to tack on or suggest as many additional items to increase your total cost. It may be genuine interest in making sure you have everything taken care of, but to me it felt a little too pushy like a salesman.  While Public Storage has great deals on renting storage units, their other items such as boxes are not as good of a deal.  I was able to find better prices elsewhere (U-haul).

Still I highly recommend this location for storage. Huge location, very secure. Make sure to check their website for better rates! Strangely, these lower rates can only be obtained online and not over the phone or in person.<//review>

I love this place they gave me a great super low rate compare to other storages around this area and I love how the staff here actually cares and provide great customer service, I left my storage unit open one time by accident and they noticed it by doing a routine inspection and they found out I left my storage open without a lock and they lock it for me and notify me, I was so grateful for that and I was pleased to have great customer service by Ava she is very helpful and provided excellent customer service.<//review>

Abdullah provided professional and courteous service during our tour of the facility and our discussion on the unit we rented.  He has a great sense of humor and was a OK with us messing with him.  Thank you Abdullah for providing us with a seamless and pleasant experience during our stressful time of moving! :)</Text>

<name>Emily Bruns</name><time>1402692891303<//time><rating>1< /rating><Review>I was very disappointed by the deceptive payment system and subsequent lack of customer service I have experienced with this branch and also the company headquarters.  I have been a loyal customer of Public Storage for 2+years and always paid my bill on time.  Recently, there was a problem with the autopay on my account (not clear why) and when I was notified of the issue, I immediately paid the bill in full, still on time.  I was notified that my payment was successful and the issue was resolved, so I was surprised when I was notified I was delinquent on my account a few weeks later with large late fees accumulating.  After calling this branch and being referred to the company headquarters, I was told very rudely that just because you receive payment confirmation, does not actually mean you have paid anything!  I was also told this was completely my fault and that I was not intelligent enough to use their online system.  In the end, the matter was not resolved to my satisfaction.  Because I do not live in the area, I was forced to pay late fees in order to keep my unit (of course with the promise of receiving "payment confirmation").  To me, this issue was simply a problem with the online payment system at the time, and certainly did not warrant personal attacks towards the customer.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Since opening a storage unit, I have seen some changes for the worst, Bathrooms closed is the major one. You have to time your visit right or you might not have a cart to use in the climate control building as there are only 3 and sometimes 1 person will use all 3 or lock them in their units.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<rating>5</rating><text>i am planning to move my household items into a storage next month for couple of months and i went to this Public Storage facility to check the prices. I was greeted by Abdullah and Tif in the office and I was amazed by their professionalism. They explained the process to me and  Abdullah showed me just the right unit i will need. Great pricing and they also have all the packing supplies i need for the move. They are both friendly and efficient. Loved the experience and would encourage all to go for Public Storage and ask for Abdullah or Tif..  Thumbs up!!!!!!</text>< Pictures>

I took my 2004 Nissan titan in for service for maintenance what they did I thought the price was a little high but when I got in in and drove it home man what a difference it ran like it was brand new again they even gave it a bath and vacuum the inside so it's like they say you get what you pay for the shop and waiting room are very clean and neat staff friendly and knowledgeable I trust these guys as they worked on another car I had some years ago and still the same great service so what ever your needs this is the shop to go to.... Great job guys.</Review>

I love this place!!  I had such a fun morning chatting with Bill and then was able to have a shuttle ride to work.  I have never been in a shuttle ride before but Joseph was vey nice and felt nothing but comfortable!  Bill was so awesome and explained things in detail which was just what I need!  They were able to get my car back to the best it can be and above and beyond cleaned it better then I have ever had it!  I am just blown away at the kindness, top shelf and welcoming service they give!!  I am incredibly grateful and will be my car shop home!  Cant wait to share this goodness with anyone who needs to get their car fixed! :)<//Text>

<review>Brett and his guys took great care of my car. Went in for engine problems, got the diagnosis in an hour, picked it up at the end of the day. Fair price and they washed/did some minor detailing on the exterior, my car is cleaner than its been in months. All running smooth now. Would recommend.<//review><username>Dylan Stolfus< /username>< Response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>My go-to shop for oil changes, smog checks, and car repairs! Attentive staff, reasonable prices, quick repair time, and lasting repair results. A free car wash is offered at the end of the repair/oil change/smog check which is a fantastic bonus of bringing your vehicle here. I also appreciate that the staff will give me, if asked, a list of repairs that could be done in the upcoming years with a cost breakdown, yet they’re never pushy about it like some car places are. Been coming to ASR since I was 19 and bought my first car, 24 now, and my parents have been coming here for many years before me. I highly recommend making ASR your new go to auto shop!<//Review>< pictures>

ASR is an outstanding Mechanic Shop!  I've used them the last 15 years for my family cars as well as my teenagers cars in years gone by.  I've probably had ASR take care of no less than 10 cars over 15 years.  The mechanics at ASR are first rate and their customer service is excellent.  Their prices are the best in Roseville and their labor charge is much less expensive than the Dealers or other auto shops. I highly recommend ASR for auto care.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>DO NOT USE ASR. VERY SHADY ESTABLISHMENT

I am very disappointed in the service I received last week from ASR. At first I received a quote of $5,200 to change a part that I later found out would have been around $3,000 from the Ford dealership. When I asked Bill why the price was so high, he said "well we have to replace the gaskets, there are sensors in the gaskets". Bill called back later to explain that they would have to keep my truck overnight because his technician broke his tool. At this time I explained i would not be having the $5,200 service done there because I had found less expensive (over half the price) options. The next morning I expected a call to come have my truck towed to the next shop. At this time Bill told me they would have my truck fixed in the next hour or so and my NEW price was $650. I asked what happened to the previous diagnosis and cost for repair. Bill replied "we were wrong." Talk about shady... later that day I went in to pick up my truck. Final price when I showed up was $840. Again wondering where the price discrepancy i asked. Bill said it was because he now added a diagnostic fee. Not sure how that wasn't included before. At this point I payed for the repairs and drove away. After confirming the truck was doing well and I thought it had been fixed to my satisfaction I attempted to turn on the radio. It didn't turn on. In fact it had no power at all. Having used the Bluetooth feature of the radio to speak to AAA and to get a ride the night I dropped the truck off at ASR I know it worked when I left. So, I took it back to ASR to explain my issue. ASR did look at the truck to try to figure out what had happened. Then sent me on my way WITHOUT fixing the radio. I explained that it worked when I got here and not when I left, and that I expected it to be repaired. Bill refused. I am highly disappointed as my previous trips to this shop were a success. I will not be going back.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>LOVE this shop! I’ve been trusting them with my BMW ever since it came out of warranty and could not be happier. They are VERY honest, nice, knowledgeable and fair priced. They go above and beyond what a normal shop would do. (Shout out to Bret for his great service today!)The complimentary car wash is awesome too (they do a better job than an expensive car wash place!). It feels good knowing I have a trustworthy shop like this near me!!!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
I have had work done recently at this shop on two different vehicles. The latest one was just yesterday for an alternator failure.
From the front of the house to the guys in the shop top notch, polite, and most importantly trustworthy and really good at what they do. In each repair the quoted price was honored and in two of the repairs the cost was lower then the quote.
Not extra B.S. no up sell, and when they say they can do the job they mean it.
If you have no where to go, or don't know the area (whatever the case is) this is a shop to consider. They are also a AAA shop so don't forget your AAA card.

Thanks Bill, Chris and the peoples name who I forget.. You guys are one of the last honest shops and I will always bring my work to you and the team.<//review>

I’ve taken my Toyota Camry and JEEP Wrangler in several times. These guys are awesome. A few times I didn’t need anything done quite yet, so I appreciate their honesty and didn’t feel like they were out take advantage of me. The work I have had done was quick and have had no problems. While waiting inside today, an old lady was telling quite the long story and the guy at the counter was very polite and patient and even helped her out to the car with her stuff. Nice to have a local place you can trust.< /Text>

I discovered this shop from yelp. After reading the reviews I thought I would give them a try and have them do some AC work on my 1951 Chevy. All I can say is they have top notch service, fair prices and they get it done in a timely manner. I have since had them work on my F250 Superduty and recommend them to all my friends and family. In this day and age it is hard to find an honest shop with reasonable prices, all I can say is look no further!< /review>

<Text>I just have to say the guys here are so friendly and really know their business. Prices are definitely reasonable too! You can't get customer service any better than what ASR gives, they go above and beyond what is necessary. They will take you home and come pick you up after repairs are complete!! (not to mention the free car wash!) We won't go anywhere else! Baker and Brett rock!</Text><pics>None</pics><GmapID>0x809b2017c3fb6df3:0xf24758600f42d448<//GmapID></record>

I was quite pleased with the professional manner in dealing with Baker during my vehicle repair experience.  The communication was great, so I knew what to expect.
I am new in the area and your business was recommended by a friend whom has lived here 40 years.  I was not disappointed!</Review>

This place does not deserve a 4.3 rating! It deserves 0 stars!!!!! I absolutely believe this place is a nasty rip off and should be shut down! Worst place I have ever been to in my entire life for auto mechanic work. Beware do not come here!

Here's a short story from my experience from this hell hole. I took my 1994 Ford Explorer in for a break fix in 2012. I went alone by myself, 20 years old and was referred by my uncle who had a friend at this facility. I was in desperate need for a good mechanic and was estimated a price of around $200. I signed the papers and waited two days for my car to be ready. I came for pick and the price was not $200 but $500!!!! For breaks!!!!! I was so upset I found out that my uncles friend didn't even do the work on my car and now does even work there Thank God! As a young a woman who has no experience with auto mechanics I now know to never repeat this experience and look out for scum bags like this dirt hole.

Additionally after paying $500 for the break work I had to come in 3 more times due to constant squeaking!!! It sounded as if my breaks were worse than before I took the car in. THREE YEARS LATER in 2015 I had to REPLACE them again. Breaks should last at least 10 years!<//text>

I've never left a review for any business in my life but due to the incredible knowledge of their trade and customer service (which is rare these days) from the staff at Auto Service of Roseville I felt obligated to.  They have a customer for life.<//review>

<Review>I took my charger in to get service. I got 4 new tires, liquid in my power steering, new front rotors, and new pads.  They waited for approval before they did any work.  I felt like they were highest and fair.< /Review></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>you guys always do a good job and I feel I can trust what you tell me about what ever problem we have is the problem, unlike most places that always try to up sell you. If there is any issue with any work they have done they always stand behind it and always use top quality parts. You get what you pay for. By the way, I have been taking my Jeep there for years and they have always done an out standing job on it, better than any 4 wheel drive shop I've had do work on it.Steve knows what he's doing.<//Review>< Pics>

I use ASR for my personal and business vehicle maintenance and repair needs. They are very professional, courteous and the quality of their work is unparalleled. Their prices are very reasonable and you know that you are leaving your vehicle in good hands. I highly recommend ASR!< /Review>

I took my vehicle in on 8/15 to repair an oil gasket leak and oil change.
Upon coming home morning of 8/19 from an errand, there was a HUGE pool of oil in my driveway.
I called and demanded they tow it in, and fix it at their expense.
The owner gave me a "free" oil pan.
I had also been told that the drain plug was leaking so I purchased a drain plug kit for $19.95.
When the owner brought back my car, the paperwork read the drain plug was stripped.
So, why did they return the vehicle to me on 8/15 this way?
And, when he returned my car today,, he told me not to come back.
Worst part about this is that they have apparently been endorsed by AAA for twenty years.
Also, their labor rate is now $120.00 an hour.</Text>

It was a very pleasant visit . everyone was nice and the job was done faster then the estimated time line. It was unfortunate that when asked if they would install a part for me that the answer was no, a lost opportunity for them to make extra money and a better name for them selves.</text>

I brought my truck in for a brake and lamp inspection. I was told it could take an hour and I said ok, I'll wait. 2 hours later my truck is still up on the lift and the inspection still isn't completed. I decide to say something and I get a "oh, that truck. Yeah we will be done shortly" I wait a few more minutes and a mechanic calls me over to show me my seeping wheel cylinders. No problem, easy fix. I head inside to pay and finally get outta there but amy astounded by the bill... they charged me two $60 labor charges and a $3.50 parts fee... The brake and lamp cert for the BAR is $7... Long unnecessary wait times and ridiculous pricing, I will never be back.<//review>

I had an experience with these guys that could of turned out very badly... but these guys turned it around and made it right.  That is what righteous, independent auto shops do, they look out for the folks in their community.  In turn, we come to trust the people who work on our cars to tell us the truth ... and when things dont turn out as expected... They address this issue and handle it like professionals.  This shop did just that,
they took the initiative to make sure that the trust between themselves and their clients, the 'social contract' if you will .... is only reinforced. Kudos to them, I would suggest them to my friends as a stand up place to take your car.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Took my 1992 corvette here as it failed smog and had a multitude of other problems. When I came to pick it up I was told that the catalytic converters were bad and that's all. However, the man who processed my payment was rude and unprofessional. I was called and told that it was ready to go so I asked for the keys to go, when the man gets offended by this for some reason and makes snarky comments. I promptly left.

On my way to work I noticed that the check engine light was now on and that it never came on before the work was done on it. I took it to an exhaust shop and they showed me that one of the O2 sensors to the cats hadn't been plugged back in, and that the other sensor and its wiring had been SMASHED.

Take your business elsewhere, friends.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Before my visit to ASR another garage told me I was very close to needing a brake job, 2/32nd of an inch remaining on the pads. My vehicle is only a couple of years old so that didn't seem right. Based on their reputation and Angie's List I decided to take it to ASR. As it turned out I have 5/32nd and 6/32nd left on my brakes. That equates to many thousands of miles. I went in expecting to spend $500+ and left with a receipt that said "no charge". That folks, is as honest as a company can be. ASR is now the only garage on my short list of Roseville businesses I deal with. I will be back.<//text>

Mac sales representative was very helpful and knowledgeable about the vehicle I was looking at. Mac did not rush me in making my decision to buy. That was a relief. After the test drive, I found the vehicle I wanted. Mac understood where I wanted to be in price he came through and happily to say I took delivery of my Toyota Sequoia Limited. Thank you Auto Republic Cypress Location.

<rate>5</rate><Review>This review is looooong overdue! I’ve been coming here for over 10 years now. I’ve purchase 3 Lexus’s from here and I’ve referred at least 6-7 people here. I’ve always purchased Lexus, but my referrals have bought BMW, Honda and Infinity.

ALL of these cars have turned out great. Never had ANY problems mechanically when I buy from them. The worst thing that happen was that the battery died in the first week on 2 purchases, but management was understanding that cars sit and it could take a toll on battery’s life span. So they replaced it with a standard battery (I personally paid for the higher quality).

My ONLY recommendation to management is try to minimize employee turn over. You have a great product and you’re honest small dealer! Why is it hard to retain people?

I know in the end, I’m there for the car and if it runs good...I’ll always keep coming back. However, it’s nice to see a familiar face.< /Review>< Pics>

It seemed the car was not moved in a long time.  The car had a different shade of paint on the bumper.  But they said the price is firm.  We didn't look back and left.</Review>< Rate>

Saw a decent price online for a vehicle. When I arrived the dealer told me they do not negotiate. The dealership  has outrageous fees. When. It was time to purchase the car. The bogus fees were over $3,100 above the asking price. They refuse to wave any fees.  STAY AWAY!!!!</text>

SCAM the prices they advertise online are for way lower than what they will charge. For example they told me tax and fees would be $2,500 additional to a $6,500 car that was not including a warranty or special features. They will try to up sale you multiple times. This is a car that is sold for $4,000 -$5,000 at other dealerships. Save yourself the trip. Also customer service is very poor.</review>

<Review>I was very disappointed after leaving this place. I have good credit and money to put down. I got to the location and they didn’t have the car I saw online. After talking to the salesperson she told me she had to go get it from another location. After an hr I came back and saw the car. It was beautiful and I wanted to make a deal. And from the looks of it they didn’t. I don’t like to haggle and was disappointed at the offer they put on the table. I was actually insulted after the salesperson asked for so much money down. She said that I needed to put the money down so they knew I was serious about purchasing a car. I drove forty miles and let them check my credit. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I sold cars back in the day and this is the type of place where they really take advantage of people. This is the type of place where you’re going to be buried in your car for years with a ridiculous apr.< /Review><rate>1</rate><Gmap_id>0x80dd2c20d75d33bb:0xd1f33cf11b6dbb15<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I purchased a vehicle from here. Very friendly staff. Very professional. BUT.... DO NOTTTT go here looking for a deal from the finance manager for older rides. Be prepared to pay what's on the sticker. My vehicle is an older model but it was in excellent condition with excellent miles. (I couldn't walk away from it).
HOWEVER, the price was set in cement!!
I wanted to finance the vehicle so I could (one) continue to build my credit and (two) not spend all of my money in one day. I didn't do either.
No bank would finance it because it's older. The year is 2005 with only 99k miles, one owner, no accidents. Sweet!!!
So I had to pay cash. And I mean EVERY penny of it.
I'm used to bargaining... But not here!
If the price tag for example is $7,000 you are not going to pay $6,999.99.
So in the end, I paid full price for my ride PLUS the taxes, lic, reg, addt'l fees, etc. ALL IN FULL... something I definitely was not looking to do that day.
OH, and because they're a private dealership they are not obligated to fill up the gas tank before you drive off the lot. If you do purchase from here, take extra money for gas. I live 2hrs away from the dealership. The tank was on "E" when I test drove it. I asked them to fill it. I got half a tank. Enough to get me home I guess.
So I drove away with my pockets on "E" but at least now I don't have a car note and I have a ride that I'll keep for a very long time!!!< /Text><Rating>4</Rating>< user_name>

<review>Came here to buy a car and Javier really helped me out, the customer service here is excellent. Not only did i leave with an amazing car, but the price was just as advertised and Javier helped me get the lowest APR that he could. Would definitely recommend if you want a hassle free process of buying a car and don’t want to deal with hidden fees and costs that other car dealers are known for.< /review>< Date>

<Review>Called about a car I saw on CarGurus, Juan answered quickly and helped me set up an appointment for the car I was interested in. Came in next day and immediately test drove the car, car was great, great condition and like new. Within half an hour I was signing for the car. This was the fastest and most hassle free car buying experience I've ever had. They provided reasonable financial options within minutes. If you are interested in any of their cars, call these guys. Ask for Juan. 10/10 experience.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<date>1592192674688< /date><Rating>1</Rating><review>Read this before you come to this place!

So here’s the story: I’ve found their ad for a Subaru Forester, called to double check that it’s available and then drove 30 miles to come check it out. Checked the car inside and outside, went for a test drive, liked it and was already going to purchase it. And BOOM - I’m told that they’ve pre-installed some protective clear film on door edges(worth maybe $20) and a gps tracker on this car and therefore it costs $1200(!!!) more than advertised. No, I cannot buy it for the advertised price. No, they won’t give any discount because the car is already “aggressively priced”. Isn’t this just a complete scam? I’m not sure if they install these “packages” on all cars, but I highly recommend to ask before waisting your precious time to come to this place.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>
{'time': 1593382175859, 'text': 'Hi Roman,\n\nSorry to hear we couldn\'t make a deal on the Forester. We do advertise a "haggle free" policy on all of our vehicles -- listed both on our site and our partner sites\' listings. Yes, you are right that they are all aggressively priced as you mentioned, we do have a team and use software that scans both private party and retail for comparable vehicles then runs them through an algorithm comparing mileage, wear/tear (if listed), as well as comparable packages and additional modifications (tires, lift kits, etc). We try to out-price all competitors, and usually, 9 out of 10 times, we\'re able to, and offer-up nicer, cleaner vehicles with lower mileages as a result... we also only sell clean title vehicles, so if you\'re ever seeing one with much lower mileage which \'appears\' cleaner, at a lower price, some dealers do list Salvage Title vehicles and then reveal that at time of signing, which is a practice we don\'t believe in. The LoJack and everything else is in the print in the ads, and we\'re genuinely sorry you missed it before coming down.\n\nThat said, we are extremely sorry your time was wasted and that we couldn\'t make a deal. We\'re the first to say that we\'re definitely not for everyone, especially those looking for the \'traditional\' car-buying experience and the hours of back-and-forth negotiating with a dealer. Instead, we pay our pricing team to ensure we\'re pricing them properly and can move them quickly and get more good people like yourself back out on the road in a vehicle they love, quickly.\n\nWe wish you the best of luck and hope you found exactly what you were looking for elsewhere, along with a deal that worked within your budget. Thank you Roman and be safe out there.'}<//resp>

That is the most unprofessional place  I have  been in. That is saying  alot I am 50 years old. They  did not want to help me at all. I was going  to pay cash for a vehicle.  I did not tell them that. They missed out on that cash. If you want professional go anywhere else and you will get it . I promise you that. Total unprofessional at Auto Republic Cypress Thanks sales . My professional opinion is to get rid of all sales people and put people in that can do the job professional and  right.< /Text>

It was embarrassingly unprofessional to see him get so emotional in order to bully me into buying the car. Their prices are also misleading--they have lots of secret costs they try not to tell you about until the very end--way more than  all the other dealers I've been to. I ended up buying the same car for a better price at another place where they treated me professionally. Stay far far away from this place.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1583702689950, 'text': "Hi Remy,\n\nThanks for your feedback, although I have to disagree about a few things. First, I have personally worked with Junior (I'm not in Sales, nor do I work at the Cypress location) and have heard nothing but positive feedback about how attentive he is when it comes to our customers and their needs. Moreover, I have seen first-hand, Junior trying to help people who were in no position to purchase a vehicle -- from helping them make better choices when it comes to credit in order to qualify down the line, to walking them through our process so that they know exactly what they're getting.\n\nAlthough our Cypress location is a smaller shop, we do sell hundreds of vehicles out of that location to happy buyers each month. We don't ever have to 'trick' people into buying a vehicle or hide any of the fees -- there are standard fees when buying a vehicle at any dealership, and our pricing -- even with the fees -- makes our vehicles more affordable and often in better condition/with better specs than the competition.\n\nAs far as getting emotional or insulting you, I wasn't there so I can't make any judgements. I will say that it does sound completely out of character for Junior to do this, considering he always has our customers' best interests in mind. I know there are often two sides to every story, so I will check with him to see what occurred, but regardless of what transpired -- please accept my apologies on behalf of the dealership and know that we wish we could've worked out a deal.\n\nThat said, we're very happy that you found a vehicle you love elsewhere and something that worked within your budget. There's something for everyone, and if it wasn't right, we totally get that. Thank you Remy and have a great rest of your weekend.\n\nElla\nCustomer Service"}< /Resp>

<review>Con artist....I purchase a 2011 Nissan Titan I was really loving the truck but did have a few concerns I was informed by the employees that their vehicles are seen by their professional mechanics and are up to good condition. Unfortunately that wasn't true I've continuously had nothing but large problems with my truck including my entire exhaust pipe hanging down once I inspected the exhaust come to find out it was completely broken and what their professional mechanics did was put zip ties around to hold the exhaust pipe up. Now I didn't purchase the warranty I took as is and that maybe my mistake but you will not be dealing with hostlers or good business men when you purchase at auto Republic you are dealing with con artist... I've also made a couple of attempts to speak to someone and get help from them in any way they not only are disrespectful on the phone but they don't return calls or trying stand by the vehicles that they sell please don't waste you time</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1574912928131, 'text': 'Hi There Aye,\n\nI just got in touch with our Sales Manager at Cypress and we’re left a bit confused, as we haven’t sold a Nissan Titan in the last 3-4 months her.

Worst service ever!! I drove all the way from the bay area for a Honda accord hybrid (wich has a visible dent in the back bumper) priced around 13,600 everything was going fine until I was ready to purchase all of sudden I'm paying 17,600 out the door   all because "they put a protective clear coat" to protect it from scratches (wich clearly had scratches already) and a lojack security system. I never asked for these optional items. You should not be paying $4,000 on top of the listed price. With taxes, registration fees, smog, plate fees, etc. you should not be paying no more than $1800. They are definitely screwing you over by putting in these optional protection plans and making them mandatory to buy with the vehicle.<//review>

Definitely never buying another car from here again. How do you guys expect people to pay good money for a car yet you guys refuse to offer a spare? The prices here were a lot higher than other places didn’t feel like I was getting a good deal. I would recommend do go else where, there was a few nice cars on the lot but they all had lots of miles on them already.<//Text>

<resp>{'time': 1564529367904, 'text': "Hi Johnny,\n\nThis is Ella in Customer Service. Thank you for the feedback, first and foremost. I've forwarded your remarks to our Management Team at Cypress and was made aware of a couple things: some vehicles unfortunately don't come with a spare. While it sounds weird to people who know cars (like us), these days, some vehicles offer the spare as a 'package' item, along with the jack, lug wrench, etc. If the vehicle didn't come with one when it was acquired, we unfortunately don't have one in-stock in order to throw into the deal. That said, if you are looking for a car in particular and the spare package is what's holding you back, our Manager would be happy to work with you on it -- sourcing you a spare locally, etc.\n\nAs far as getting a good deal, we do strive to beat out 9 out of 10 competitors and even private party ads on comparable vehicles -- same package, comparable mileage, wear/tear, etc. We're sorry if the vehicles you were interested in had higher mileage -- we get them all, from cars with less than 200 miles on the odometer, to value-priced vehicles that may sport a higher mileage but still be in great condition.\n\nAll this said, if you're interested in a specific vehicle here, we'd love to accommodate you and your needs/budget. Please give our Dealership Manager, Junior, a call direct at 714-828-0555. He's aware of your situation and would love to offer you a concierge car buying experience, tailored to your needs, with one of our best team members to assist you from test-drive to financing.\n\nThanks Johnny, and please let us know if we an help you. If we've missed the mark, we understand -- just know that the spare tire, etc. is unfortunately out of our hands... as for the mileage, definitely take a look at our site as new vehicles pop up every day at 7pm across 3 locations. We wish you all the best Johnny."}<//resp><gmapID>0x80dd2c20d75d33bb:0xd1f33cf11b6dbb15< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I went to a spot specifically for a Ford Fiesta ST and they had one but it was not a daily driver so i went here for a car that had 20k more miles with basically the mind set it would be challenged as well BUT thankfully for us it was on the way home so we stopped and.. BOOM.. !! The car was available and in decent shape for its age PLUS it ran stron as an Ox! Loved it from the moment i sat in the first one but when i sat in the car Auto Repulic had.. i had to have it!! I was cautious as this vehicle is Turbo Plus it has 70k miles and to ease my trepidation.. i was informed oi could add 100,000 miles of warranty coverage for 30 odd bux a month... so awesome! If you are a car person and desire a model may i suggest you speak to William or the other staff members at Auto Republic because honestly.. if you want quality and folks who go that extra mile to satisfy a specific taste, just speak up. These guys are super cool!! Thank you!!<//text>

<Text>Auto Republic Cypress was probably the best find I have had this year. I was in desperate need of a car, something used, w/ low mileage, that would be able to keep up w/ the amount of driving I do. Honda’s are my preferred make. My car was dying and I was pretty much car-less. I had stopped by a few other used car dealerships but there were different issues (no real inventory, overpriced, no customer service, just to name a few). My friend and I were driving down Lincoln and we spotted Auto Republic. At first we hesitated because it looked so fancy, and as I don’t have the best credit score, I was limited and thought I was not qualified. Regardless, my friend made a u-turn and we went to look. As soon as we walked into the lot, Marco walked out and immediately greeted us and showed us around.

Marco was great!! He was friendly, understanding, and went out of his way to try to assist me in trying to get the best deal possible. Within 2 days, I was on my way to owning my very own 2014 Honda Civic. Marco gave me SO many tips on refinancing, building up my credit score, walked through all the paperwork with me and made the whole experience just as easy and comfortable as possible. Not once did I ever feel lied to, pressured, or uncomfortable. Everything was explained to me thoroughly, and was given even more advice in order to make the most of my deal. I did not have much expectations of what I would be able to obtain w/ a limited down payment and low credit score, but needless to say- I walked out of there with an amazing deal, knowledgeable and with a vehicle that I absolutely Love!

Marco and Auto Republic Cypress- THANK YOU!!!

It was great working with Auto Republic in Cypress! Found the car I wanted at Auto Republic in Fullerton but they didn't have the color I wanted so they checked their other locations and (ta-da!) found it for me at their Cypress lot! The Cypress location made it super easy and did the vehicle transfer for me so I didn't even have to go out there. Loved working with both Auto Republic locations and will recommend to friends and family looking for cars in the future!<//Review>

Purchased a 2005 Ford mustang and it was the perfect car for me after months of looking. I was helped out by Albert Larios and the guy was extremely helpful and honest willing to help any way he could. Also the the person who went over the contract with me was great he explained everything in detail. 5 stars easy ask for Albert he'll be tons of help</text>

DO NOT TRUST. This dealership went to extreme lengths to hide problems with the car they sold me. The check engine light was "from a dead battery," and would, "surely go away once you drive a few miles." Turned out to be a problem with the exhaust system that was a $5000 fix. The loud noise from the diesel engine was from the "missing engine cover," which turned out to be a scapegoat for a broken flywheel ($2000 fix). The vehicle history report that they gave me showed NO history of a crash, but when I recently sold the car I found out that it HAD been in an accident. How this was covered up is beyond me. When I tried to return it I was told, "You bought it as-is. We will not take it back." Do NOT trust these people. I took a $15,000 hit on this vehicle. They are professional scammers.</Text>

The WORST car buying experience you will ever experience, especially from the rude and unprofessional manager at Cypress location.

The manager repeatedly changed the final prices on the car and was giving attitude when you want to know more. The manager got the tax fee wrong and at first wouldn't admit his mistake. He almost forced me to sign a wrong document.

Hands down the WORST customer service and extremely unprofessional! In addition, be careful with their cars because it is full of flaws and will give you troubles in the near future.<//Text>

After first finding the car we wanted at CarMax, readying to take it for a drive, we were told that someone 150 miles away had already asked to have it moved to their nearby CarMax. We were disappointed to say the least. The car wasnt under contract but they refused to sell it to us. We figured we wouldnt find another one similar.

Fast forward a couple days later. While looking on Car Gurus, we found another car very similar to the first one. So in a rush, we drove 60 miles to this Cypress dealership on a Sunday. Albert met us at the door.

The car was exactly as we found it in the many photos provided. The price and mileage was similar, in fact the price was even better than we would have paid elsewhere.

Albert was a pleasure to work with. Getting the financing completed was easy. In less than an hour and a half, we were on our way home with our new Prius.

Thanks to all at the dealership, and a special thanks to Albert for his professionalism. Truly a nice experience.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Purchased a 2006 Civic Si with low miles. On the "due bill" was the dealer fixing the check engine light, which was illuminated due to bad 02 sensors. Along with the emergency brake handle which was broken. After having the car two days, and before having the "due bill" work completed, I found out under a panic stop that the rear seats were not latched in place. In fact, the rear seats weren't the correct seats for the car, so they couldn't latch!

I contacted the dealer about the seats and they wanted $500 to fix the seats, after complaining about safety and so on they agreed to put the original seats back in (why were they ever taken out?). I dropped the car off at their Fullerton location to have all of the work performed. I called a week later and was told they were still trying to find the parts. Nearly two weeks went by, with me calling every day for updates before they fixed the rear seats. I was told that they would not fix the 02 senors since they fixed the seats.

Under California law the dealer can not sell a car which can not pass smog. The car will not pass smog with the bad 02 sensors. I've tried contacting the dealer to resolve this issue, but they are not interested. Now I face paying hundreds of dollars to have the 02 sensors replaced, or I can spend my time trying to sue them in court.

I would not recommend this dealer, nor their Fullerton site.< /Text>< time>

After test driving the car , we sat down to negotiate a price. When he went to talk to his boss, he came back out saying the car was not available. I drove almost an hour to see a car they had already sold. Thanks for wasting nearly two hours of my time.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Bought a car from them in April of 2012 and they covered up a car in the windshield.  Overall a bad experience and a reinforcement of my dislike of car dealers.  The car actually runs very well.  So that's why they got two stars.<//Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I just wanted to thank MARCO for his professionalism in buying my first car ... I bought a 2012 honda accord coupe. The car is in perfect condition, they gave me a 5-year warranty, but the most exciting thing was to see how MARCO focused too much on meeting my needs ... not so much that I bought the car but that I was happy with the car that I was about to buy. To all people who are first buyers, I advise them not to be afraid when trying to buy a car. I was very indecisive, but I took a very pleasant wait. Their selection of cars is very wide and all their cars are super cared for. Thank you MARCO and my next time a family member or friend needs a car, you can be sure that they will go to their dealer, 🖒🖒

Solo le queria dar las gracias a MARCO por su profesionalismo al conprar mi primer carro.. yo conpre un 2012 honda accord coupe. El carro esta en perfectas condiciones me dieron 5 años d garantia pero lo mas emocionante fue ver como MARCO se enfoco demasiado en atender mis necesidades.. no tanto q yo conprara el carro sino q estuviera contento con el carro q estava apunto de conprar.. A todaa gente q sean primeros conpradores les aconsego q no tengas miedo al tratar d conprar un carro yo estuve muy indeciso pero me lleve una esperencia muy agradable.. su seleccion d carros es muy anplia i todos sus carros estan super cuidados. Mil gracias MARCO i mi proxima vez q necesite un carro algun familiar o amigo puedes estar seguro q iran a su dealer ,🖒🖒<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
I ended up trading some rims and tires 4 tires for my 1995 Silverado pickup. I traded chrome rims that were 22s and I was only discounted a couple hundred dollars before it even though the original price for the rims and tires were over a thousand but there are quite old. I felt a little Bamboozled but all in all it wasn't that bad bring your negotiating skills if you ever go up there because they are hustlers< /Review>

Don't go to these guys if you actually value your money. Horrible customer service and horrible cheap parts. I'm willing to bet that most of the good reviews about this place are fake ones because no body in their right mind would give this place an above 2 star rating.< /Review>

Literally left the shop like 5 minutes ago. Idk what people you dealt with but the people I came across were legit. TONY was mad helpful! Great prices and fast service. Some of yall are probably just picky people. I'd highly recommend this place. Love the fact that they're open late to unlike other places.</review>

Just got off the phone with Tony. Super motivated sales guy. If it stays on the shelf, you're not making money. He's trying to sell everything. Tomorrow I'll be there to pick up my 235/65/17 x4. Thanks Tony.<//text>

Going here feels like I stole something because their prices on new tires. I have a 2015 Toyota Tundra with 35x12.50r20lt tires and the final price for my needs was 950 out the door. Isn't that AMAZING!<//text>

I have purchased Atleast 5 sets of Rims and tires from this place and every time is better than the previous time. Customer service may not be the best as everyone reports but the overall service is excellent. You’re in and out in no time.  And the prices are reasonable. Rims and tires are all new and legit. Absolutely ZERO complaints.< /review>

Great customer service! I went in today for new tires and rims for my Jeep. The lady that helped me with pricing was pleasant. The guys in the shop were nice and worked quickly. I will definitely return to JTW tires in El Cajon for future tire needs.</text>

She then said i myself would have to walk up to this table with 6-7 guys eating lunch and start asking them when they would get back to work and to price some tires for me....i declined to bother them on break...completely ridiculous having every single person on lunch at the same time.....again! The last time this happened was years ago so i said never again coming back here. Would Jack in the box have all their employees go on break all together? Been doing that "everyone's on break" shctick for way too long...i myself am staying away from these "professionals" i suggest if you want professionals GO ELSEWHERE.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

It has been 7 years since the last time I went there and I still love this place they have the best price no one can beat it. For every person that's saying they gave them one price and then they were charged with tax why they got surprise in California we have to pay tax for everything  so put that in your mind.</text>

<review>If I could rate 0 stars I would. They have the worst service ever. I tried to buy some rims and tires and they said to be back in a hour, so I came back in a hour and then he said 5 more min. And it turns out they didn't even have my tires/ or rims in stock AFTER I PAID FOR IT. Then they said they will be here Tuesday. And they didn't even order anything. The manager Tony stated "he doesn't need my money" after I said to refund my order. They are low life's and will swindle you out of your money. STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE. No idea how it's still open. It's a very trashy environment too.</review>< Response>

I have 24" tires, so they are pricey. I called this place & they were a $100 a piece I'm thinking... Yes found a cool deal.
Strike 1: said they were in stock but they weren't. My car was sitting on Jack's kz they took my tires off already without telling me they didn't have the tires.
Strike 2: I waited for over an hour then seen a truck pull up with my tires

Strike 3: he takes me inside to write me a receipt and says my total is $260 with taxes and labor included.
I've bought tires for my car several times before. If it's taxes... You say $100 + tax. If it's labor as well you say $100 ea + tax & labor. I feel this was BAD customer service. I was robbed without them holding a gun in my face is how I felt. I was livid!!!!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I've normally always had good experiences with this Joes tires location, but this time I went, Tony tried to charge me double the quote he gave on the phone when he saw I was white and had a BMW.  He never did honor his phone quote. He denied it and called me a liar.</text>

<Text>1 star is too much for them , unprofessionals . I called them to ask for tires size of my car they told me we have it just bring your car over . When I brought my car they took tiers off to to put new tiers. They says. We don't have that size, we can order it for you . I paid for order . When I came next day to get my tires. They said we still waiting because it's come from los angels. We gonna call u when tiers come they didn't call me .because they (charged for tiers but they didn't order it. Don't ever go to JTW . Liers. Bad service.</Text><user_name>George G</user_name>< date>

<review>They have a nice selection of inventory, but their service is horrible. I went there to get 1 rim and they put on the wrong one. They told me to call back in a week, and when i did call back they left me on hold for 20 MINUTES!!!!

I never went back to get the right rim. Their communication is horrible and not worth the time to do the job right.</review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) A year ago I went and ordered some wheels for my car, when I was going to go for them the owner wanted to raise the price much more than they had said at the beginning, obviously I was not going to pay more than we had agreed, just this guy He is a little man who has no word and today I checked again.
Today morning I called to ask the price of a tire and the owner told me 90 dollars, I went to change it and at the time of paying the lady tells me that it was 125 dollars and I told her I called and they told me 90, to which she He replied: "The owner told me that he will charge you 125," I told the girl to call him, the owner arrived and he told me if you don't like it I can take your tire off I don't have time for you, I can simply say that the owner of this place is a damn fool that because he is a woman he thinks he can take advantage of you, so if you are a woman or put a foot on this site, for my part I do not set foot in this place, the owner is a moron!!!!!!

Hace un año fui y ordene unos rines para mi carro, cuando iba a ir por ellos el dueño me quería elevar el precio mucho más de lo que habían dicho al principio, obviamente no iba a pagar más de lo que habíamos acordado, simplemente este tipo es un poco hombre que no tiene palabra y hoy lo volví a comprobar.
Hoy por la mañana llame para preguntar el precio de una llanta y el dueño me dijo 90 dólares, fui a cambiarla y a la hora de pagar me dice la señorita que eran 125 dólares y le dije yo llamé y me dijeron 90,  a lo que ella respondió: "el dueño me dijo que te cobrará 125", le dije a la chica que lo llamara, llego el dueño y me dijo si no te gusta puedo quitarte la llanta no tengo tiempo para ti, simplemente puedo decir que el dueño de este lugar es un maldito imbecil que por el hecho de ser mujer cree que se puede aprovechar de ti, así que si eres mujer ni pongas un pie en este sitio, por mi parte no vuelvo a poner un pie en este lugar, el dueño es un idiota!!!!!!< /review>

<Text>My 15 yr old cat's liver started failing so we tried everything until she stopped eating and drinking.  The vet did an amazing job putting her to sleep. My wife and I were balling our eyes out. It's a sad and painful thing to experience but the vet and the staff were amazing. They also fit us into their schedule at the last minute when my regular vet wouldn't.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZVZuBqJ5tl2cR1HvfMXb0VqOwahJE82F-9W1K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

The vet recommended a few food options, and happily the first option ended up doing the trick. The next time anything comes up with him, we'll be heading back over!

Have brought my fur babies here for years, all recieve the best care.

Recently one of my loves was having stomach issues that we could just not shake, health deteriorating and we could not let her suffer anymore. We had to make that decision, and we brought her in. They were so compassionate as we were balling our eyes out even as covid restrictions were in place, bless their hearts.

Fast forward 2 months or so, still adjusting to the change and we received a card in the mail. I know they sent appointment reminders but this time was a sympathy card with a nice note, thank you ladies. And of course, the water works.

Such a kind gesture, thank you Animal Medical Clinic.<//Text>

I AM SO RELIEVED TO HAVE FOUND THIS VET!

I have a long haired german shepherd who unfortunately has aggression issues with strangers. My family struggled to find a vet that we not only like, but one that created a peaceful environment for our dog, Gigi. We were always so hesitant whenever it came to vet appointments because it was always an anxious experience for all of us. Prior to bringing her into the Animal Medical Clinic, we drove over 2 hours to our original vet towards the Bay Area. Not only was it a hassle, but we did not like our previous vet treated us.

However, our experience at the A.M.C was extremely positive! Gigi did absolutely great. I have never seen her this calm at the vet and was shockingly surprised. Dr. Janzen is amazing. I thank her and the staff for welcoming Gigi and creating a positive & pleasant environment for our baby.

The staff here is extremely kind, patient, attentive, and understanding. They thoroughly explained any issues regarding our dog health concern and were very professional. You can tell the staff here is compassionate and attentive towards their clients.

In addition, their COVID-19 procedure is great and you can tell they care about the safety of the staff and their clients.

Moving forward, we will always take Gigi here.< /Text>

My cat went in for a check up and was perfectly healthy and that same day after the appt she has been continuously sneezing . I'm not sure if they are too clean in that office. Dr. Janzen is a good doctor but the quality of cross contamination from other sick animals is not up to keep. My cat is 13 years old and I'm disappointed she caught something from her visit.</Review>

<Date>1594063610453< /Date><rating>5<//rating><text>In short: I’m a long time customer who has visited many, many times the past three years. 10/10, I recommend to anyone needing vet care

I recently went to Animal Medical Clinic for a routine check-up on my senior cat, Jasper, and decided it was about time for me to leave them a review. Although Dr. Janzen (the doctor who has seen and cared for all six of my and my immediate family’s cats and my dog the past couple of years) was out/on leave the day I went, Dr. Cehrs met my high expectations for veterinary treatment. She and the regular staff treated Jasper and I with respect, even when my cat can be a bit difficult when it comes to restraint for anything other than being pet. Price for his vaccinations and blood panel (something I requested, since he is rather old and hasn’t gotten one done before) were discussed ahead of time so there were no surprises when it came to payment.

It is a small practice, but I fully trust the people there when it comes to caring for my furry friends and my concerns for them. They were there for me when I took in some of my grandmother’s animals, they sent condolences all the way to Arizona (where I go to school) when I had to euthanize my dog, Dr. Janzen did surgery on my kitten when we found she had an inguinal hernia (and re-checked her at no cost when our inability to keep her on crate rest caused her stitches to tear) and removed one of my elderly cat’s teeth when he was having trouble eating, and they’ve all been there for countless vaccinations, boosters, spays and neuters, cornea scratches (one of my cats always aims for the eyes when unhappy), and other medical concerns. Though the staff can have busy or depressing or difficult days, they all seem to really care for their patients and the people that come with them. I appreciate them for that.</text>< pics>

<Review>I like the ease of getting an appointment meant quickly.Dr Janzen is great as are the other Vets and Techs. I took my baby Gracie in when she was about 7 .When She was 13 she got an extremely fast cancer that took her in less than a month.The staff was very exellent when it was time to let her go. I now take my male Beau a Pittie mix in. Always extremely caring.< /Review>< pics>

This is the best veterinarian I've found in fresno. She has an awsome bed side manor and takes the time to properly evaluate your pet and will take the time to make sure you understand what's going on and give your pet the proper care. The only down side I've seen so far is she is busy and it can take a few days at times to get in. They do allow walk ins for emergencies. One of my favorite features is the seperate waiting rooms for dogs and cats. By far the best in fresno area.</Text>

This was our first time here, as I had just taken in a fostered dog. He was undernourished so I wanted to get him checked out. The doctor and the staff were all awesome people & you could clearly see they love their patients! 🐕🐾<//text>

Found this place on Yelp.  I couldn't be more delighted with Dr. Jantzen and staff.  They are extremely professional and have taken good care of my dog Cooper, shots, dental work, check ups and all very affordable.  It is easy to get appointments which fit my schedule.  The Dr. is very knowledgeable and explains things clearly.  I am delighted with this veterinarian and clinic!!</Review>

My family loves Animal Medical Clinic. Dr Janzen and the staff take great care of our pets. They cured our puppy when she had to stay over night for parvo and made a special home visit when we had to put our elderly pup down. I recommend them to everyone I know.</text>

< Review>
You can't find a better place to bring a loved pet, family member.
The staff and Dr. are very personable and caring people. They are really interested in you and your pets.
When I first came here, I had a cat that had been dumped at my door. He was very sick with a infected eye. Dr. Janzen went above and beyond in helping him. All, at a very compassionate rate for me, seeing that I was doing this on my own dime. Today, 8 years later, he's still with me and she still treats him. She has treated all my pets, my small family members. Treating them all with the same compassion as she did the first time I walked in.
Thank you Dr. Janzen and Staff at Animal Medical Clinic.</Review>

<Text>Dr. Janzen and the staff are great. She even called a week after to check up on my pup. A separate feline and canine entrance are so awesome.  Plenty of parking and easy access from the street.  I really appreciate the calm and peaceful atmosphere of this clinic. Dr. Janzen is very knowledgeable and my dog felt at ease with her. It is a good match for us.<//Text>< pics>

Took my Pitty in for an ear infection. The staff is great, really attentive to both owner and pet. They showered so much love on Bear he wanted to stick around even after the ear treatment. They have a sperate dog and cat entrance and lobby. Price is explained up front.<//text>

They don't have office hours that accommodate people who work. Closing at 5 pm does not allow people who have a job to go here. If you are a pet hospital you should have longer hours. Wasn't able to schedule with them because their hours aren't good< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Because they tell the truth and they don't charge as much money as other veterinarians they tell you what your pet needs and what he doesn't need and for the good treatment of animals

Awesome group of guys here. We were looking for a place to rent some X-country skis, after four different locations came across these guys. Cool dudes. They gave us great advice. They remind me of the down to earth guys in my home town, happy to give them my business. We had so much fun we ended up keeping the skis for a few more days! Would recommend to anyone looking for a good rental spot, they have tubes, bikes, skis, the works. Will be back for sure. Thanks for making our Tahoe trip that much better!<//Text>

<review>Fantastic location and experience. Rent your bike here because it's in the center of everything. Buy everything I don't mean stateline hotels and casinos. That's a terrible place to ride. This bike rental shop is across the street from the city park and perfect for jumping onto any of the regional bike trails or highway bike paths.< /review>< user_name>

<Review>over charged $70 more for no reason. I do not recommend. Employees do not explain well before the rental and also are very rude.

Update: the company called and refunded the entire amount. The owner apologized and was very understanding. Besides this incident at the end the bike ride was fun. Really appreciate the call of the company.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>We rented two cruisers and 2 mountain bikes and rode around South Lake Tahoe. It was an amazing experience and good exercise. We were helped by a young gentlemen in the front who was very knowledgeable and a very sweet man named Steve. We hope everyone will get to experience the fun we did while in Lake Tahoe.< /review><rate>5</rate>< user>

<text>What a great idea it was to take some multi seat bikes to ride. Sure was fun riding down hill did not take in to consideration that the ride the other way would be treacherous..., it was not fun riding back up the hill! Lol
Still loved it and will do it again the next time I'm there.<//text>< pics>

We had a incident with my sister phone being lost during the bicycle ride and there was some miscommunication when we return the bikes. We were overcharged 30 minutes each bikes, but the next day the owner call us and was very understandable of our situation and and offer a full refund! Our family appreciate it so much!!</Review>

Would have been a five star, bikes were great, employees were friendly, but one of them was not wearing a mask to check people out or work with you on your bike. As Covid cases spike in Tahoe. Enough said.< /review>

We rented bikes here to ride around the town and it was decent. Only bad thing is that we asked for a dog carrier attachment for the bike and they give us the most trashy beraly working and dirty one.<//review>

<text>We rented bikes for a party of 4.  We each had issues with our bikes, so we returned them after 30 minutes of riding.  When we explained the issues to the staff, they were unresponsive and unaccommodating.  They charged us for the rental without acknowledging any issues.  One of the staff mentioned that the back tire on one of the bikes was on backwards.  I would not recommend this establishment for any reason.<//text>< Pictures>

They told me that there was a bike cart was available. So, I completed filling my paperwork and there was a lady behind me on line and she had not started her paper work yet, then they told me she will get the available cart that I supposed to get, because she was before of you. After a long argument, they gave me $10 discount.< /text>

<name>Donovon Anderson<//name><text>The #1 place for your dose of Tahoe Enjoyment. With a large variety of rental equipment both during the summer and winter as well as full service bike shop. With an awesome location and an extreamly helpful staff this is the place to be. everything from Pedego E-bikes to your everyday road bikes, mtn bikes, beach cruisers, kids bikes and the unbelievably fun Surry's in both 1 row and 2 row options. Enough room for the whole family to ride together as a group. Rentals in the winter include snowshoes, snowboards, skis, and sledding equipment. All that in 1 place is hard to imagine, so stop by 3131 harrison ave to start your vacation off just right. Steve is the Owner of not only Tahoe Bike and Ski co. but also The Welcome Home Shop Wine and Decor and the newly opened Idle Hour  Wine and Bubbly Bar. What an amazing gateway to enjoy every last drop of a true Tahoe Experience.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80998fc73dd5012f:0x3661c0d2f8a3ec97<//Gmap_id>< resp>

Guy who did my work was kind of a jerk, but he was fast and cheap.  Luckily he's a quiet jerk, so expect a minute or two of discomfort and the beginning, but you'll be on your way quickly.</text>

It used to be about the cheapest ski rental shop in SLT. Now they've put the emphasis on bike rentals and the price of ski rental is up.</text>

(Translated by Google) When I went there in January, during the snow season, most shops closed their bicycle rental business, and only this one was open. The owner owned a French bulldog. I rented a lady's bicycle here. The owner helped me adjust the cushion height and recommended a route for me. It was an afternoon that I will remember a long time later.

(Original)
去的时候是1月，雪季，大多数店都关掉了自行车租赁业务，只有这一家开门。店主养了一条法国斗牛犬，我在这里租了一辆女士自行车，店主帮我调整了坐垫高度，给我推荐了一条路线，那是一个让人很久以后还会想起来的下午。</text>

Wow. I randomly found this place and I'm glad I did!!! If you're fond of sour beers, then you have found your heaven. I got a flight of four different types of sour beer and each one was completely different from the next.  The staff was friendly and explained what a sour beer is made from and how they make their beers.

It's located in an industrial setting, so it can be hard to find. Google Maps will put you right there, though.

They have barrels aging their beer, kind of like a rick house, and it's a fun place to relax.

Go try one for yourself.<//Text>

Great beer, but none of the 3 food servers who work here wear masks. This is dangerous and illegal. A purchase of food is mandatory here, so they should figure this out.< /review>

SOUR ALERT! Located in a super industrial spot.  It almost seemed like we were in the wrong spot... but then again most good breweries are located in these random areas.
They don’t do tasters, but they do half pours.  On a scale of 1 to 10 on the Frambues, I’d say it’s an 8! 👌🏻
Definitely check them out.< /text>

Great brewery specializing in sour beers, saison, and NEIPA. Cool vibe. Cool place to hang out when it's hot outside. Easy parking in an industrial park. Food trucks sometimes.<//Text>

And while one employee greeted us super friendly, the other gave us the dirtiest look. I assume they were having a conversation and we interrupted. We decided to try it out anyways and sad to say the beers weren’t that impressive either. Both of the beers that we ordered were flat and I felt like we were being rushed into ordering. The decor and atmosphere were cool I did like how the place looked but unfortunately it seemed like we were bothering them.  To be quite honest they aren’t even deserving of the one star I just gave them. Wish the experience could’ve been better</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Before Casa Agria I thought I just didn't like sour beer. The truth, I found, was I hadn't had one that was made right! The "sour house" has an excellent rotating selection of sour beers, as well as some the of best tasting hazy IPA's I've ever had! The chill atmosphere and friendly staff are the cherry on top!< /text>

<review>We come here about once a month. They always have great beers for any taste bud (sours, IPA's, stouts) and super friendly service. Highly recommend picking up cans if there's any available when you go - we've not had a single one we were disappointed with. I think their Hazy IPA's are comparable to Monkish and the drive to Oxnard is always less trafficy :)< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1581964105298, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words.'}< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80e849577af822a5:0x50f268c6e5e82fd5</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

As a lover of sour ales, I just had to visit Casa Agría ('Sour House' in Spanish) once I heard of it. They did not disappoint. Their great selection of sours (farmhouse, saison) and one IPA, stood up to our tests. I heard that they're expanding into a neighboring space and plan on adding other types of beers, as well as food, to their menu.< /text>

Not family friendly. I was really looking forward to spending the afternoon here. Our family drove 45 minutes to get to the brewery on Father's day only to be told at the door that no children were allowed. We've been to plenty of breweries and this is the first time I've seen one where children are not welcome. We turned around and drove home, but decided to stop and check out Institution on the way. Glad we did, the place had a great atmosphere that wasn't hurt at all by kids sitting at the tables. Afraid I can't comment on Casa Agria's beer since I didn't get the chance to try any.<//text>

I'm glad we searched for "ventura sours" and found this place! The beers were great, and the bartender was friendly and nice to chat with. The brewery is strangely placed in the middle of a business park, and not very obvious with the signage, but worth the slow drive through the parking lot. We wish it were closer; we'd come more often!<//text>

Tucked away in an industrial area between Oxnard & Camarillo is where you can find the BEST sour beers in the 805!! Marcus & all of the Staff are very friendly & knowledgeable!
Take home a bottle or two, trust me, you will get the hankerin' for it when you get home. The artwork on the labels are always on point as well.
Really nice vibe here with colorful artwork on display and there is usually a food truck available in the evening. Free comedy nights are an awsome way to spend your Manic Monday's.
Casa Agria is where it's at!!!!</text>

<text>Great place to visit, especially if you're into sours and wild ales. Huge selection, which also includes a few solid IPAs and stouts. Friendly staff who can offer good recommendations. Very unassuming and no signage from the street so don't miss it!< /text>< pics>

<Review>The place has potential however it seems like the staff either doesn't care or is too uptight. Their air conditioning didnt work so it was stuffy and humid. They charged me for an extra beer after one of the workers opened a second tab for me. Another worker put the charge on my first tab and said he was going to void the second tab but never did, so now I have to call back to get it fixed over an $8 Beer (not happy). The beer is fine, but the staff is very unprofessional.<//Review>< pics>

Excellent offerings and currently the only brewers to supply a selection of lambics and sours here in Ventura County. They seem to specialize in sours (and good for them) but have also produced really nice Vermont style IPAs. Seek these guys out.</Review>

Remember when you first tried Lambic and thought, wow, this stuff is amazing? Well, you can get sour ales—for that is what Lambic is—close by. Eric and the genius brewers behind their Casa Agria (Spanish for "house sour") in Oxnard have crafted a most amazing assortment of sour ales to delight and tantalize your palate (for the record, the ales I tried have not been sweet). Try the salty one (La Llorona)—don't worry—it's only mildly salty. Or Mega Citronic—hoppy, citrusy, complex. Listening to Eric talk about his brews is like listening to a composer talk about his symphony: “We collected the wild yeast in an organic field and then . . . we aged it for four months in a bourbon cask, then switched it to a port cask and finished it off with . . . " I don't remember the details, but I was spellbound listening—these guys are off-the-chain serious about extreme creativity when it comes to brewmanship, changing and responding to what’s in season and imagineering exotic new tastes. But mostly, it's the ale. It's always about the ale. Just sip and think and enjoy. Casa Agria will be YUUGE someday, you can feel it. Now it's tiny, so go quickly and try—while you can still talk to Nick and company and get a dose of sour-mania first-hand.</review>

We got a tour of the berry orchid (it was our first time here) & wine tasting. They have a good variety of berries.  We picked & tasted blueberries & strawberries as well wondered through the rows.  Great experience for kids minus the wine tasting.< /Text>

<Review>I love this place! The last 2 springs/summers we've taken our kiddo out there to pick strawberries. It's fun and educational for them to choose their favorite strawberry varieties (they have 4) while also learning about where their fresh fruits and veggies come from. It can be a little pricey for a large family but children 5 and under are free so that should alleviate some of the cost. $5 per person and $5 per pound of strawberries picked (the bags once full, are about 2 pounds each). It's nice once in a while, to get out in the sunshine and fresh air and pick some delicious fresh produce straight from the earth.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0rvHPSlTziqsJQnaeE0Hm2Cxk570GnsPN-G8J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

John welcomed us and gave us a tour with wine tasting.  We chose to pick our own berries and veggies.   Had a space for us that was perfect for an Rv towing a car.   Would definitely recommend.< /review>

Beautiful little farm with many types of berries and walnut orchards. Spent a lovely Saturday morning with my daughter picking the most delicious strawberries. They have four varieties. Can't wait for blueberry and raspberry season. Staff is very helpful and informative.<//Review>

It was beginning of Summer, but the farm was mostly picked off, many of the berries were not ripe and many dry. There were additional sections that were nearly empty, didn't see any strawberries for example, and were not marked on the map we got. Sadly it was disappointing for my visitors who were looking forward to it and was charged an entrance fee for the little toddler too who was 2 years old.< /text>

Called ahead to see if they were open on Sunday. He was super nice and said to just come on by whenever and gave directions. He let us know that berry picking season was over, but if we were still interested, he had vegetables and nectarines that were still available. Came over on Sunday and had a great time. 2$/lb and honor-code set up. Left a little extra in the lock box, because of what a great find this place was. Will definitely be back if we're ever in the area ♡</review>

You aren't close by other people. #1 you can't beat fresh fruit. Support local businesses! We will definately be coming back soon.< /review>< Pictures>

They have a cannon blast that goes off every 20 minutes to scare away birds. Even if you know this you will jump because all you are thinking about is berries.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Bought some Blueberry wine at the local Farmers Market, it was amazing. Sweet, but not over sweet, will definitely buy more when they're back in my city.< /Review>

Sunday morning girlfriend wanted to pick some blueberries but the place she found was three hours away. We found Rancho Notso Grande in Google they say their closed on Sunday but gave the number a call just to find out if they still have blueberries. John was great said I could stop by today. Sunday is by appointment only. We had a great time the whole place to the two of us. Thanks John!<//text>

<review>Very nice people and a fun experience for those who have never picked, but way OVERPRICED!! You will pay retail ($7.50) per pound to pick your own and a whopping $10 per pound for already picked. If you're a serious blueberry fan and want to buy a lot to freeze and use all year, there are farms in Reedley and Kingsburg that will sell for $3.00 a pound, already picked. Totally worth the drive. 😁< /review></record></dataset><record>

Not too big so you aren't feeling overwhelmed by trees and bushes, but definitely enough berries for everyone. We will be going back soon.< /Text>< response>

<Text>Small, roadside business that let's you pick the various types of berry vines or fruit trees onsite for a reduced price &eat while gathering! Fun, outdoorsy family experience. They also serve berry wines, vinegarettes, and other "berry" & local food items. Very nice small business owner!<//Text>< Pictures>

It is what it is. Decent dim sum for what your paying. There’s not enough carts with good going around, so much that I had to get up a few times to try to get something I wanted to eat only to be told that they didn’t have it available yet and I had to wait. Point of the story is, I didn’t get the egg tarts. The only thing good I can say is due to the pandemic there isn’t a huge crowd in the lobby when your walk in. There’s been times when we’ve left due to too long of a wait to eat. Bottom line is there are much better options for dim sum in the SGV than this place.</review>

Excellent Chinese food, well priced! Plenty of free parking in the outside lot , or underground. This is on the 4th floor of the Focus Department store shopping center. They often have a special, spend at least $40 and you get a free lobster dish!<//Text>

Went to a wedding banquet here. The food was pretty good as Chinese banquet food goes. The steamed fish, scallops, and fried shrimp ball crab claws were really good. The service was actually too quick as courses came out before they could be finished but they boxed everything up for take out.<//review>

<text>The place is decent, with authentic, flavorful Cantonese food. Noise level is high, service is ok. If You happen to speak Cantonese, you’ll receive a better service overall, but if you only speak English or mandarin, you experience would not be as nice. If you are here for dim sum, I would recommend coming early for weekends? As the line would easily exceed 1 hour if you come after 10 am. Edit: try not to come on weekends. Especially if you are unlucky and is assigned to a remote spot, you’ll most likely get very little food, if no food at all for the entire time of your stay.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0RjOkx9K48EZFU-kyYDQ7VzACUsQZtBnpdVCF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgpmBCFIlLaGh2QNHjkkDhztC_89tURTtwFWEq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPJZvuD4IcijA2ANgZ2_DgGNIkomaZprJa3TPq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIRob5lBUgffoFiifvg1c6tyPZS6L7KLGcp7jQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoZt_INJtv_YA6In9g658fk_GMf5atVJwMq1ET=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFdLPzQw-BF4Ij5Tz-cqijaLtSGbX6J7ZHUl6m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1gVvW-034CrT1mOce613XzLA70d9k8Q0ZcDG9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFiNJLlZ0QAAaZhKRnljg__apjkLa88La3c7tN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwjUNA58RhAIqRtk_e6yavDge2vBLS4_EHpHOH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeVu-rN8KPgjMcDaz8-J5F3FISFEQeteoaOmHH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcKfL-Hrq_SsCbRh4PS0ck5APQ0SmzOCXDEtnR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Dim sum was so delicious.  There is always a wait.  They have a big selection of dim sum and the staffs were friendly.  This is one of my fave place to go for dim sum.< /review>

This place is great for dim sum! But be prepared to wait they get really busy for dim sum if you go in the morning. They serve dim sum every day week days are cheaper than weekends though. If you go on weekends it gets super packed and crowded. If you go make sure you leave one member of your party there to hear them call your number. If you aren’t there they will skip you and give your table to someone else. The dim sum is really good for the price. There are several varieties available the sui mai is great along with several other dishes. This place is also pretty good for dinner. They have large servings that are really filling.<//review>

Dim Sim is good.
Fried rich noodle is so so, taste is not good.< /text>

Gone is the lady calling out numbers on the PA like an auctioneer, now they have some overhead displays to show your number. This fact hasn't diminished the overall charm. I always get a kick out of the fact I'll be a lone Latino ( or few if I'm with some buddies) in a sea of Asian faces. I've dated a few Asian women who seemed impressed at my love for this place. Anyways this review is for Dim Sum as I have not eaten dinner here yet. The selection is mighty, always the usual with some never before seen selections mixed in.

We were treating some Mainland friends here. The food here on the mainland is interesting, add some items do not exist in Hawaii. This is equally true of dim sum here on the mainland. It was quite delicious though and I have no complaints about it. The people eating with us were very impressed.<//Review>

Price is very reasonable, but the wait is an hour.   Too many friends of employees went right in without getting in lines.    That's where they lost the star.</review>

Very reasonably priced dim sum! Expect around $25 for two people. The selection is extremely wide, however you should either be semi fluent in Chinese or have someone with you that is since most of the waiters speak no English at all. The dim sum itself is very good. Shumai and chicken feet run out quickly so order early!</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Excellent food of Chinese dim sun.  Always crowded so come early before opening to get in line for a table.  We always go with Chinese friends who know interesting food to order.  The price is a bit high but the service and atmosphere and each dish is good. There is happy energy in the restaurant.  It is clean and well organized.  The staff is enthusiastic and joyful.  Parking is limited because of vast crowds @this Chinese shopping center<//Text>< pictures>

I used to like this place a lot about two years ago. I came here quite a lot with friends to get their late night food, and normally there were a lot of people still came here to eat at 10/11pm. I visited this place again two weeks ago. The food tasted terrible. Each dished tasted bland, saggy and not fresh.< /text>

The best tasting dimsum so far.  The tendon is specially tasty.  Siomai is fresh and flavorful.  No need for sauce actually.  There are also a good number of desserts.  The sesame balls are delicious, not oily like the ones offered in other restaurants. The place could use some upgrading though.</Text>

It's on the 4th floor of the complex, the windows allow a good view of the San Gabriel mountains. The new Hyatt hotel being built will block some of the view. Parking lot is large, but can still fill up on weekends at dinner time, especially if there are wedding banquets.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Food is not bad, service is next to none. During the entire time the waiter did not smile AT ALL, and didn’t even say a word (he only nodded with a solemn face). Does he hate me (or his job)? I am not sure. At least it proves the restaurant’s authenticity?
The atmosphere is also too crowded and too loud, for someone who is not used to such a Cantonese restaurant. I will avoid the place in the future.</review><username>S X< /username>< resp>

<review>One of the best Chinese Seafood restaurants in Cali, if not in the whole country. Some of the meat and vegetable dishes are a little too salty, but you can’t beat the freshness, cost and quality of most of the dishes. Don’t expect great service, though - as with other authentic places, you may have to fight to get the server’s attention. Still, it’s a premium restaurant, packed on weekends, holidays, and special events.< /review>< name>

<text>The restaurant is on the top floor. It is very large with a lot of seating capacity.  During dim sum the food arrives quickly and regularly.  There is a large selection to choose from. Good food and the price is great. I highly recommend.< /text>< date>

The Dinner menu features seafood. Menu is very large. Lots of interesting dishes.

I attended a very fancy banquet here. Many luxury dishes including a fantastic King crab, lobster salad, roast squab etc... Almost everything was excellent.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Dim sum here is great. the best time is to come around 10-11 because they have more than just their usual dim sum carts going around at this time, things like sauteed mushrooms and a lot of shrimp dishes.  it's also a massive space so you might not see see carts for a while.  Language barrier is prevalent but understandable as San Gabriel is an area populated by mainly Chinese.  Docked a star because they always understaff the wait staff so they end up spreading themselves thin and forgetting that you asked for water or a take out box.</Review><Date>1567785933515<//Date>< username>

A nice Chinese Dim Sum with friends.  The price is reasonable for $ 3.25 per dish. If you don't mind of the wait after 1030am on weekend, otherwise start out early. Open @ 7am on weekend. Just piont out item you would like to try. Hostess speaks very little English. Just enjoy the atmosphere of typical Chinese dim sum place. Take some adventure to explore Chinese food.<//Review>

<Review>I have been coming Five Star Seafood Restaurant a lots of time, and it is overall okay to me. The advantage of this place has different kinds of Dim Sum, and it is decent as well. Their service is ok but  it is lacking at the peak time. However, Parking is one of the problem here especially on the weekend, and the waiting time for a seat on the weekend is terrible as well.
Overall, I recommend people need to come early on the weekend if you want Dim Sum at his place. But, I am not suggest to come here for dinner unless with no choice in SGV area or having a big party because other places is better than here based on food quality, prices, and services.< /Review>< pictures>

Not bad for the price. Was around 13 bucks a head with some leftovers. Typical dim sum cart place and the lines can get pretty long. Would recommend coming before 10:30.< /Text>

<Text>DONT EVER COME to this place. The food is fine, but the tea is overpriced $8, we didn’t even get to see the price of it. The service is truly terrible, the waiter just wandering around the whole time, we couldn’t even get to start our order for the entire 10 minutes until we looked for them. After the server came over, he automatically assume we know all the dishes and asked what we want without giving us the menu. We explained he should tell us about what he has, as return he speaks very soft,annoyed and very tiring to us as he like just woke up. When he walked away from us, he even gave us the LOOK. We tried to forgive about him and gave them 15% tips due to empathy of their hard life, and as another return, we didn’t even bother to say thanks or appear any happy smiles, and then just walked away. The food’s quality is not worth to come here with such service, if you want to have a fun time for the meal, DONT EVER COME!<//Text>< pics>

Havent had a wedding where some of my friends didn't get wasted :-). The food is excellent and their seafood would never disappoint. I doubt it there is a weekend there without couple of wedding's going on. The volume of fresh fish they go through weekly is insane. That alone certainly speaks to the taste and quality.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Restaurant is located on the top floor of the focus plaza inside of the 99 ranch market plaza. Came just before 9am which is perfect if you dont want to hassle with parking later because it gets nuts after 10.  And park facing outward>> jeez us these spots are narrow and not alot of wiggle to get out!

I am always a fan of the old school  Hot carts instead of ordering them from menu. However this places selection of items disappoints me. Maybe because of the location of where was sitting but we didn't have very many carts visiting us and I felt like we had to approach most of the carts to get the food I wanted. There was  a lot of rice dishes and a couple a dumpling related items and breads. I definitely feel that I have had better variety and tastier at other places. What I don't understand is how many people are here because the food was like OK and it's a pain to get here....escalators weren't in service so u had elevator slowly rising or stairs and this was almost 11 am, so I dunno.< /Text>

The food was decent for the price. The attitudes of some staff is *eh*. Price wise for dim sum I would say it is average. If you don't know people working there the wait will be pretty long. Peak hours are from 9am-12pm. Parking was also a hassle in the morning and afternoon.</review>

<Review>This is one of the most popular restaurants in the area. Cantonese style cuisine. Their dim sum is delicious and there can be up to a 2 hour wait on the weekends ( go before 10am if you want to avoid long waits).

Their dinner menu is also delicious. Not the cheapest menu, but quality and taste are on the mark.  Their Peking Duck is great too!

This place is popular for weddings/engagement parties. So some sections may be closed on certain occasions. They also have some private dinner rooms, so it's great for smaller private parties.< /Review>< Name>

<text>Food was delicious, although two things.

1. It took 20 minutes and we had to call someone to get us our tea, the first 3 waiters forgot our request

2. Literally no carts passed by our table

Still delicious food though.<//text>< pics>

Terrible customer service. Was lectured when asking for hot sauce. One of the worst choices for dim sum. Never coming here again.<//Text>

Food was really good. Banquet menu was exquisite. Steamed fish, scallops, lobster, etc. Location is not too good. Difficult to access on 4th floor and small elevators and narrow stairs...and parking lot is always crowded.</text>

<Text>Best prices in the entire area with the best variety and food.  Service is fairly organized for the lines of xustimers always here.

All cart food items are between 2.70 to 3.80 depending on the item but prices are 10% more on the weekends.<//Text>< name>

< Review>
I just had dinner at five star seafood restaurant. The food is good,  but this merchant cheated on the final bill. When I ordered the lobster, the waiter said the price is $20/lb and the size is around 2lb. When the lobster dish was served, I saw the attached detailed bill said the weight of the lobster was 3.25lb. I thought that maybe the small lobsters were sold out, so I didn't argue   the weight. Guess what, the final bill showed that the lobster was 3.85lb. I initially thought it might be a mistake, but several restaurant staffs all insisted that the previous weight (3.25lb)  was wrong, 3.85lb is final and correct weight. What? I can't believe such a dishonest business is still opening and recommended. In the end, I paid for the  lobster in 3.85lb but deduct $13 from the 15% tip. Why I still paid the tip, it is because that the waiter did provide the service and they probably could change nothing for this kind of cheating trick.< /Review>

This place isn't worth it because of the poor customer service. The food doesn't make up for it either. My family and I went to this place during the time when they were serving Dim Sum. The servers were rude and some of them even ignored what we were trying to order. We asked for porridge from one of the carts and the server looked at us then walked away without saying a word. Also, do not get tea from them unless you want to pay $20. If you want to be respected as a customer, do not come here.< /Text>

My wife and I have been going here for several years.  It is called Five Star now.  We have 4 other Dim Sum places that we compare it too and enjoy - but we always agree that this place is the best.  Extremely busy at the weekends, we have found a mid-week visit extremely congenial.  Fast service, hot and fresh food, very inexpensive.  We don't mind even if sometimes the waiters are a bit grumpy and rude.  There is a good variety - and our favourite dishes always seem to taste just a bit better here.</review>

The waiter welcoming the guests was pretty cold. Whatever would be the best word to describe that. The scallops I ordered were visibly not related to the shells upon which they sit. You bet those shells will be reused again and again to create the same illusion. Worst of all, taste is not impressive. I wouldn't go there again.< /Text>

<Review>The food is good, I'd be tasteless if I say the dim sum here is only ok. However, there are so many people, normally have to wait for 40-50 minutes. Also, even if you are in, they serve food with carts, sometimes carts with food you want just doesn't come by. However it tastes amazing, can't stop coming just because of long wait times.<//Review><Rating>4</Rating></record></dataset><record>

i  am an old timer In LA . This is one of my all time favorite.  Price is very competitive. They have the silkiest rice noodle wraps 腸粉。If you are shrimp lover be sure to try  the  crispy grilled tofu skin wrap over shrimps 脆皮鮮蝦卷，and the fried shrimp paste ball drumsticks on mini sugar cane sticks 蔗蝦球。Very few dim sum place in Calif. offers these dishes. Arrive early  on weekends and holidays brunch hours ,  otherwise expect long wait up to 45 minutes.< /review>

Don't let the name of this restaurant fool you.  If I could give a negative score...it would be a -5! We were celebrating my sis-in-laws birthday by having a family lunch. My family arrived at the end of dim sum. We were hungry so we ordered several items from the carts. My mom was very explicit that we were having lunch and wanted to get a menu so we could order the main dishes.

We sat for 1 hour, waving at the waiters and managers only to be ignored.  My mom asked for a dinner menu twice with no results.

We asked for Jasmine tea and got chrysanthemum tea. The waiter argued and said it was Jasmine.  (He's speaking to a Chinese family that owned their owned restaurant so we know what tea is being served).

Finally I got fed up and went to one of the managers and said give us our bill for the dim sum because apparently they don't serve food.  I said this in Cantonese so she knew I wasn't just some clueless Chinese American. She quickly came to our table and said she would take our order and get food served to us right away.

Food came quickly but the service sucked completely. Not one person came to wait on us. We had to get our own forks for thw kids, take out boxes and bags to pack our leftovers. As good citizens who live in America, we did the right thing and tioped 15%. But damn, I wanted to put $1 and say we are never coming back!< /review>

Came here this morning for dim sum. Arrived around 8:45 no wait. However there weren't too many carts going around, service was slow and food selection was very poor. Customers were leaving their tables to chase down carts to get their food because they were tired of waiting. The quality of the food was mediocre. I don't think I will ever return to this place again. Don't waste your time coming here<//review>

Quite the variety of delicious Chinese cuisine and dishes to choose from, but be wary of how difficult it may be to visualize and understanding what you are ordering. Service and free food amenities (appetizer soup, tea, and pudding) are quite excellent in quality.< /text>

<text>This is dim sum the way it should be! The plates are all very moderately priced, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is exactly the same from when I ate dim sum with my family as a kid. It can sometimes be difficult to get the attention of the wait staff, but that's mostly because they're rushing back and forth rather than purposeful neglect.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Came here this morning setting was not even complete on the table and none of the bus boys would even come around to complete the setting or even ask us what kind of tea wewanted. I had to chase them down and get the settings myself. Even then none of the food carts were in the area that we were sitting in. All the customers around us were all looking around for the food card looking at each other hungry. I had to take the ticket and walk around to look for food carts myself to ask the food like I was begging for food. Anyone that gives any stars to this restaurant is ignorant or friends of the restaurant. Today they got the exact amount of tip from me that they deserve which is $0<//review>< pictures>

This is popular Cantonese restaurant in the area.  Always a long line jn lunch and dinner time.   I really don't know....  Food is mediocre at best and price is not that cheap unless you going for their promotion item in dinner.  Don't bother come here Friday or Saturday dinner time it super packed and sometime they don't event accept any more people after 7pm.  Service is pretty poor from many visit had to keep chase them down.< /review>

<Review>They said that we would only wait for 30 minutes but we've been waiting here for 2 hours! The lady at the front desk yelled at me for asking how long it will take. I don't think this restaurant deserves the name "Five Star". They won't even take away two chairs to let us sit ( we came in with a party of eight and there's a free table of ten)< /Review><date>1514836598525<//date>< user_id>

The worst service I have ever had in a restaurant. Me and my wife arrived on Tuesday night at 11:30 only 2 other tables and it took the servers 10 min to take our order. After that I asked for hot sauce and soy sauce I never got it until I asked for my check. I will never visit this place again and don't recommend to anyone.</text>

<text>I went for dinner on a weekday. I was seated quickly but nobody stopped by for more than 15 mins even though waiters were bustling about and served customers at nearby tables. Finally, I got up and left, nobody bothered to inquire why I was leaving.

The place's name seems up to debate but the quality is spot-on! Excellent dim sum brunch, cheap, just be prepared for a lot of pointing and gesturing as the English language skills of the staff are hit-or-miss. Also, don't come after 130 PM as you'll hit the awkward phase where no new food is being made but the same carts keep circling, trying to get rid of the last of their wares...<//Review>

Still has the hot steam carts rolling thru the entire eatery. Lots of selections from greens to a large variety of steam, baked and deep fried dim sum galore.
Undergoing a remodeling process now but that doesn't interfer with the service.
Prices more reasonable Monday thru Friday.
Slightly higher on weekends and holiday.
Plenty of free parking too.
One of our best go to Dim Sum eateries.
Full bar available too.</text>

Food is good with quality and quantity but for service needs to be improved  its hard to get the waiter around you
Even though you saw many of them nearby, wait for a while to take the orders after you get the foods, the waiter was gone that's all services that you can get. We have been there for a few times and it is still the same. .no more!</text>

<text>food was flavorless; felt like they just boiled what ever you ordered in water without salt. When complain to staff they didn't acknowledge the problem and just said that's how it is.

There are plenty other restaurants in that plaza, just go else where.

To chef(s) if you  are reading this, please taste your food before you bring it out to the customer.< /text>< rate>

The food here is okay. It's not terrible except for the fact that I found a hair in my turnip cake, and then 2 hairs in 2 shrimp dumplings. They took those two items off my check, but my dining experience was thoroughly ruined. 1 hair, I can try to ignore, 2 was bad, and 3 was just plain gross. It's hard to ruin dim sum for me, but they managed to do it. No, I will not be coming here again.</text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>This place really dropped the ball. I came religiously with parents for dinner. I am not reviewing them based on their Dim Sum, but rather what they serve during dinner. They keep changing chefs so their items are never consistent. Yup, that's the way Asian restaurants work. New chef, different style of cooking. I used to order the lobster and the green onion oysters. Parking is always a hassle here since they share the lot with the supermarket and a few dozen other shops.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2dab740e88fcf:0x345ac21ab38fa3d3<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The meun variety is okay. The place itself is awful. The plates are broken and dirty, which they are covered in stains and chipped plateware. The food is under average because there is no good flavor and it is over priced. The server's attitude is a bit rude but nothing unusual in these settings. Wouldn't recommend because there's better restaurants in the area.< /Review>

< Review>
This restaurant is the epitome of chaos.

There's no one to seat you. You have to flag a waiter down to seat you who will pass you off to another waiter who is confused where to seat you, and repeat this process about 5 times before they found us the most horrible spot right by the entry of the kitchen. Despite the fact that the restaurant was almost completely empty. I can't fathom why this was so hard for them and why they sat us there.

There is also no one to take your order. We had to flag someone down, fine I can deal with that. The actual ordering process was very difficult. My friend was fortunately Chinese but that apparently didn't help much. After our order was taken they still got it wrong.

One of the dishes they brought out was our 1lbs order of fresh shrimp. As my friend and I were about to eat it the waiter takes the dish away and with a very confused face and starts to just walk around with it. Back into the kitchen, back out to the dinning area, walks by us several times before bringing the dish back to us about 5 minutes later. Whaaaa just happened???? And our fresh shrimp was no longer longer hot.  I asked him where he was going with our shrimp and he ignored me.

The main thing we came here was for the fresh crab. We ordered the fried crab.  They got that wrong. Apparently on the receipt they just put down "crab" so they brought out a stir fry ginger crab. When we told them that's not what we ordered, they brought the crab back, washed off the sauce on the crab instead of getting us a fresh one and just deep fried it. The crab was SO over cooked. The meat was burnt to the shell and nearly impossible to get off. I know they did this because there was still globs of deep fried sauce stuck on the shell. The crab was extremely greasy.

They brought us 1 bowl of OLD RICE. The rice had a hard shell on the outside of it and was cold in the middle.

On top of that, the weight of the crab they put on the receipt was 2.5lbs. I fortunately cook enough dungeness crab to know that a 2.5lbs dungeness crab is HUGE. The crab they brought us was much smaller, no bigger than 1.10lbs. They overcharged us double! Beware, that kind of dishonestly I would never recommend anyone to come here.

Getting the check was a mission. I prefer not to marathon around a giant restaurant in order to get service.

Just, don't eat here. Safe yourself.< /Review>

Best dimsum I've found around LA. Usually a long wait on the weekends if you come after 10. Service is efficient. Dimsum is amazing. Try the turnip cakes and baked chasiu bao (BBQ pork buns). Very reasonable prices.</text>

We usually order Pu Erh tea for starters and get the basics from here. Har gou, siu mai, rice cakes and what not. We can defintiely say the quality is fairly consistent, but like any establishment they do have their off days.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>This place always gets super busy. A little advice. For dim sum, arrive around 8 or 9am just to avoid the lines. The food selection is crazy and there is so much to choose. Unless you really don't care about a big wide selection of dim sum dishes and would rather sleep in. Come around 1:30 or 2pm when it dies down. Most of the dim sum dishes are repeats. They don't cook anything new. Sadly, the truth. When you com here for dinner, make sure to come at 5pm. It doesn't get busy for dinner until 6pm. From 6pm-9pm is the dinner rush and it's a long time to wait for tables. This restaurant is huge. Thus, what needs improvement is bathrooms. They should've had a bathroom on both sides of the restaurant. It would make it more convenient. It's a great place to eat for dim sum and dinner. I have had no quarrels yet. I have been coming here since it first opened. Key thing to remember: if you come here to eat even once a month, try to familiarize yourself with staff, ask them for their names, mingle with them. This is a key strategy even if your not Chinese. I have seen my german friend jake, and he knows two of the guys in black suits.. so he can always get a seat earlier or request a dish at dim sum if he can't get it. The dinner is what attracts a bunch of people, if you order 3-4 dishes, you get a 5th dish free. but its on the posters. it's not presentable for those who don't speak chinese. But take it from me.. ask about.. don't i get a free fish or shrimp?</review>< Pics>

Bad customer service.  Super crowded for lunch, especially on weekends. Cheap dimsum though, but not very good. Dinner is just the opposite: very quiet but price is competitive.</review>

Work for me. Not your spiffed up spruced up dim sum but definitely where I'd say very authentic. I give it stars for variety, taste and price ($2.49 week days all one price and $2.79 weekend )< /Text>

<Review>I've came here a few times, but this time the dim sum wasn't as good as the first few.  The food was just subpar, service was displeasing and extremely slow.  Although, it's a large restaurant, comfortable seating and a wonderful view.  Dinner might be better.</Review>< resp>

The reception is terrible and rude. She expects you to run over to the reception in one second when you number is called or your table will be given to someone else.

Asked to speak to the manager about the situation. The guy who turns out to be the manager said the manager is not available. We had to ask his colleagues who is the manager.<//review>

<Review>Expect to wait for at least an hour if you come here for dim sum on the weekend.  Good luck if you have a large group of people.  They need to expand their waiting area because it's unsafe to have people standing next to the escalator, or blocking all exits.<//Review><response>None<//response><user>110580345857842726291</user>< date>

Good dim sum, huge place though so it does get hectic.  When we were there, getting a table for 6 around 12:30 on a Saturday took only 10 minutes.<//Review>

<Text>Authentic Chinese restaurant, down to the noisy atmosphere, bright lights, favoritism, and operations and cleanliness standards of China and Hong Kong. I wouldn't say it is racist, but there is a bias to serve you differently if you have no one (or just one) Asian at your table; such as asking if you need a fork, or presenting you with less "weird" items as suggestions.<//Text><username>Kelvin “Kai” Mok< /username><user_id>101067603138215039711</user_id><rating>3< /rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< date>

Come here for dim sum all the time, especially since they had specials from time to time. The only bad part is the huge wait for a table, so make sure to arrive early. Drink tea since you pay for it.</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Chinese restaurant with good value for money... but prefer their morning tea... the first time in Los Angeles, if you only eat one in Los Angeles Chinese food. - Then come here and try it once, you must order the series, special lobster squid, chicken shark's fin, red squid squid, north and south apricot, seaweed, mage beef...

(Translated by Google) I just went to the peninsula to drink tea. I ate it for 1 hour without seeing the shrimp dumplings. I asked four people to say something. The manager sent a plate when he couldn't wait for the checkout. After seeing the taste, I was disappointed, my favorite shrimp dumplings changed into taste! A dumpling has only one small shrimp. It doesn’t taste much. It’s only half of the original hope to restore traditional food.

(Translated by Google) A few nights ago, I went to the peninsula with my relatives from afar. I really didn’t have a face. I ordered two crab meat and fish belly, but I only got one, and 10 people got two small ones. I asked for a la carte. The result said that I forgot........ called 4 pounds of lobster, the result is almost the same food... But the lobster has not disappeared... I asked to forget the order... I was speechless... This meal is really blushing, shameful... I don’t want to give a star.

前几天晚上带着远方来的亲戚去半岛吃饭 ，真让我没面子 ，点了两份蟹肉鱼肚羹 却只上了一份 ，10人平分才一人得两小口，叫了点菜的问了 结果说忘记了........叫了4磅龙虾，结果菜都吃得差不多了……可龙虾还没踪影……一问又说忘下单了……无语 ....这顿饭真的吃得脸红 ，丢人……能不给星一颗都不想给< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) In Luoshan, the morning tea is very good. As for many people who say that the service is not good, hahaha, they have never been to the Cantonese-style tea house in China and Hong Kong. Reluctantly give a 4 star praise.

(Original)
在洛山機來說早茶算很不錯的了。至於很多人說服務不好，哈哈哈，他們是沒去過國內和香港的廣式茶樓。勉強給個4星好評。</Review>< Date>

(Translated by Google) The price of the dishes is reasonable, and you have to ask about the price before the drinks are ordered. A bundle of watermelon juice is $20.

(Translated by Google) Drinking tea tastes generally, the environment is too bad, and I can't hear the same table at all. The dinner service was very poor. No one greeted after sitting for more than 10 minutes. The taste of the dish can only be considered as middle and lower. If it is not a good location, it is estimated that there will be no guests to go to the bad place to eat.

(Original)
饮茶味道一般，环境太差，根本听不到同桌讲话。晚餐服务很差，坐下10多分钟都没人招呼。菜的味道也只能算中下。要不是地理位置好估计不会有客人去那种烂地方吃饭。<//review>

(Translated by Google) I am very grateful to this hotel. Not only is the food delicious, but the quality of the staff is also very high. Today, I lost a package and was hired by the staff to prepare for the reward. But the employees said that this is what they should do, and they are more anxious than us. Moved, the peninsula will be the first choice for me and my friends. Thank you for the peninsula. I wish the peninsula business is booming, the financial resources are prosperous, and all employees are happy!

(Original)
非常感谢这家酒店，不仅食品美味，员工的素质也非常高，今天遗失一包被员工捡到，准备酬谢，但员工们说这是他们应该做的，而且他们比我们还着急，太让人感动了，以后半岛将是我和朋友们的首选，谢谢半岛，祝半岛生意兴隆、财源广进、所有员工生活幸福！</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I don't know when the name of the English shop changed. I really didn't expect that the taste of the dishes in this restaurant can be regressed to this level. Apart from the sashimi, the 800-knife table does not have a delicious one. How did they make it?

(Original)
不知什么时候英文店名字改了。真没有想到这家饭店菜肴味道可以退步到这种程度，800刀一桌菜除了刺身，没有一个好吃的，他们怎么搞的。</Text></record>
