This is the best place for Pizza! Love the customer service some of the best I have seen in a long time. The owners make sure you feel at home! The food is top quailty out of this world. You can not visit Santa Barbara with out going to Roccos pizza on State Street ❤</Review>

Pizza is great but your security guard is really rude and has tried picking fights with me and my friend both of the times we’ve visited, accusing us of knocking stuff over when we haven’t. He needs to chill out.<//Text>

<Text>This place is open late at night. Grabbed a slice after midnight. It had a great 80s music playing loud. The pizza by the slice was classic New York style. It was good! Service was quick and you can’t beat the price - $5 a slice. It looks like they also serve beer and wine at the bar. If I ever get hungry in the middle of the night again, I’ll be back. Love the vibe though, quintessential American.</Text>< rating>

If there was a 0 star I would have put that as an option. No wonder there was no one in the restaurant on a busy Friday night at state street. 6 bucks for a slice of pizza that takes 30 mins to make when they have no other customers. Bought a soft drink for THREE dollars couldn’t even get a refill and they didn’t even give notice. Out of date music playing along with the TVs showing replays of motorcycle races instead of the NBA finals when the LAKERS are playing! Unbelievable! I will never spend another cent here.< /text>

<Review>Being from the Northeast area, I miss good NY style pizza. I saw this place and wanted to try it. I also wanted to see if they got it right. I was very pleased with the pizza as they knocked it out of the park. I had been looking for a place in California that had good NY style pizza and I finally found it. Cheers to you guys!</Review></record>

I wanted to rate this because people are saying it might not taste like New York Style pizza. My grandparents had a place in Syosset, Long Island and they loved to take us to Mario's Pizza. The pizza here tastes like Mario's. So I would say it is New York Style and tastes really good. The only problem is it is expensive because it's on State. People are saying $5 for a slice is cheap, it really isn't when you are talking about a regular cheese pizza slice. Regardless, I enjoyed eating pizza here.</text>

We got the New Yorker size vegetarian - it's huge. Price is decent, a bit on the high side. Pizza was fairly tasty, a bit hard to eat (floppy at the center with a lot of sauce).< /review>

<Text>This is the best pizza I have ever had!
We drive from Simi Valley to Rocco’s just to get a slice of pizza, or two, and a glass of wine!
The ambience is warm and inviting.
Family-owned and operated with love!
Highly recommend that you go see them, enjoy family atmosphere, and have some awesome Pizza!  They have a wide selection of wine and beer as well.
We give it a solid 5 !

Horrible customer service. The owner or manager and the older lady are rude and cheap. Bottom line I would never recommend this place. $7 for terrible slice of pizza served on cheap flimsy paper plates. They handed me a huge pizza of sloppy pizza on a flimsy 99 cent store plate. When this too heavy pizza for the plate made the plate flimsy and pizza slide off right at their counter in front of them I asked them for a new slice and a better plate or box the rude owner insisted I was intoxicated to cashier who handed me the pizza and it was not their fault the pizza fell off plate. (I am 6 months pregnant.)  I overheard her rude comment and asked to speak to someone else, when the owner and manager came over he told me I could buy a new slice for half off. Cheap cheap cheap....Then he yells and kicks a (stranger) out of the restaurant who witnessed the whole thing and defended me and thought how they acted was so unprofessional. Bottom line terrible customer actually no customer service. His own employee offered to pay for a new slice for me. The money was not the issue it was the principle and doing the right thing. Bottom of the line don't go, I spent $30 on 4 (slices) of pizza and they couldn't even work with me when they saw the whole accident. We all didn't even finish the pizza, too much sauce under cooked and flimsy.< /text>

Finally East Coast meets West Coast -- Uncle Rocco's New York's Pizza is one of the most delicious restaurants out here in California. Thank goodness I found this place! I just tried the pasta with meatballs, and now it's one of my favorite dishes. Besides the pasta, I absolutely love the cheese pizza. I love the Frank Sinatra music that's playing while I eat; this is definitely a true authentic Italian pizza place!

Love love love! I'm from NY and was missing home looking for BETTER pizza then Rusty's and some of the other joints in santa barbara. I walked in and was instantly transported to one of those dive-y pizza places in the city. And the great pizza matches. Will definitely be going back!<//Text>

<name>Michael<//name><review>I ordered a slice with pepperoni and Canadian bacon, which was $7 after tax, plus I think I tipped a dollar. When I got my piece it had no Canadian bacon, so I went up and the guy realized he messed up and took the slice back to put on the missing topping. It came back some moments later with the Canadian bacon hardly warmed at all, looking like they'd just been taken out of the fridge and slapped on. I ended up picking them off and eating a mediocre slice of pepperoni pizza that I waited too long and paid too much for.

<text>My 14yr old son said that the cardboard pizza we got at COSTCO was better than this pizza.  Small, crowded, and no soda refills.  My kid said that he hoped that the forgion visitors who  we're in there did not actually belive that this is what actual New York style pizza was really like.  It was Thanksgiving so we went up the pier and ate some real food.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Hands down the number one pizza in California. I drive up from Simi Valley as many times as I can and every time I do I make it a point to stop here and have a couple of slices and salad. The food is always fresh, the place plays great music and stays open late. The owner always is smiling and always quick to answer questions about his pizza and his background. Stay on State St and expand down this way. Thanks for the great food.<//Review><UserId.>108238867475931950434< /UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Gregory B<//Name>< Rate>

Would be 5 stars if the slices were $2.50 for a cheese instead of $5.  But the quality is excellent.  Very good pizza, and I was sober when I went there.  Owner is a nice guy, actually from New York, so he knows pizza.  None of this California garbage pizza here.</Review>

A triangle of disappointment. I didn't think it could be done, but uncle Rocco did it. This is by far the worst pizza I've ever had. It's almost like they are trying to make it into Ripley's believe it or not to prove bad pizza does in fact exist. And to make matters worse, they charge 75 cents for ranch, and the guy behind the counter won't even be a homie if you dont have change. I just dont understand why there is not another at least decent pizza place in sb!?<//review>

<text>Greasy slice with a crispy bottom at a good price. Add whatever toppings you want and it's ready quick. Also had a good beer in a frosty mug for only $3. I'll be back next time I'm passing through.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< time>

Hit or miss depending on the day.  When I was there the other night, the pizza was definitely not made recently, they told us they were completely out of pasta ~10 mins after ordering it.  Not worth the $5 per slice that night.< /review>

This is a pizza joint to go to after a couple of drinks to sober up. As a sober person the sauce of the cheese pizza lacked flavor. The some kind of sandwich (maybe italian) that had red lettuce, or a spring mix salad in it tasted like vinegar, and the penne with meatball was cold, the meatballs were seasoned pretty ok, but the sauce lacked flavor as well.
There was a tall man working the cash register, and he didn't have the greatest customer service either.
Maybe it was an off night.<//text>

This is the first time I have ever reviewed any restaurant, but I feel obligated to let everyone know how overpriced and average their pizza was. I paid 6.59 for a slice of reheated pizza that was so dissatisfying I don't think I'll ever stop regretting it.</Text>

Took a huge pile of laundry including three big blankets and was in and out in under two hours. Everything looked and felt sanitary and well-kept. Being able to use ApplePay was so nice after years of hoarding quarters. The woman working there was so friendly and helpful and even threw in forty minutes of free dryer time for me to “get you started”.</Text>< Resp>

Clean with the fluff and fold service option. Parking can be a lil challenging at times... Having a pizza parlor and corner store across the street is a plus. They also have options for payment -machines that take cards or cash and an ATM on site for your convenience! Plus there's an Amazon pick up site.< /review>

Loved this place for wash and fold until Ms. Lottie went sour. She was very sweet in the beginning until a matching set of my partners clothes went missing and we spoke to the owner about it, then she became a nasty petty lady who later ended up washing our colors and whites together and ruining our white clothes. Very sad to know that she’s not as nice as she perceives..</Text>

<Review>***Remember to push the green button on the dryer's card reader machine, until you reach the amount of drying time you need before swiping your card**
**Every time you wash I think you get like your 10th wash free or something like that, you should research, and this is counted when you pay digitally with a phone app, or with credit card.
**

The two biggest and best washing machines are straight ahead when you enter the door to the laundromat. This is what we use because we do laundry once a week.

The owners are really nice an answer the phone if there is an issue with a machine. This has to be the best laundromat there's an Amazon Locker, you can pay for your laundry with your card, You can get cash, and you can buy hot Cheetos.</Review>< userid>

I’m working as a consultant here in Oakland and needed a place for drop off service. This is a family business, and what a wonderful bunch of folks they are!

Friendly and efficient. They get my laundry right back to me.

They’ve got my business for sure!</Review>

Very Nice Environment, Manager always keep it clean and it’s centrally located next to lots of eateries, The Lake but very hard to find parking. The Manager is friendly and nice but a little fussy sometimes. I still enjoy the peaceful here other than that.< /review>

< Review>
Beautiful laundromat. The owners have done a really nice job and keep it sparkling clean. I love picking up my Amazon packages at the same time. When I don’t feel like doing my own laundry, I hire the wash and fold service. I like that they have the credit card option and an ATM. If you use your credit card, the 10th wash is free!!! Really convenient amenities.<//Review>

< review>
Had discussed with Lottie for her to launder and dry my down comforter with Mrs. Meyer lavender scented laundry soap and dryer sheet. She  wanted me to use oxyclean and other brands but I declined.
My laundered comforter smelled strongly of detergent, no lavender smell.  Lottie couldn't smell it, removed her mask and kept burying her face and nose into the comforter to try to pick up the scent.  I was repelled.  She also does not observe social distancing.  I asked her to re-wash it , just with water.  The comforter still has a strong detergent smell, not as bad as after the first wash. At this point, I don't know if she used other detergent or used too much of Mrs. Meyers and the 2 rinses failed to  rinse out the soap, but I found the experience upsetting.<//review>

The machines work really well (they take credit card and quarters, which is super convenient) and while I’m waiting for my stuff to wash and dry I can go to the coffee shop or grab a bite to eat a couple blocks down and get some work done. They also stayed open for COVID which is amazing, because the other laundromats around here closed!< /review>< Time>

Lake Merritt Laundromat: Perfect place in the neighborhood. Before my first visit today (Sept 21), I looked at the reviews and pictures - and I am happy to report that it was a great experience. Great experience because of the option of modern/updated, Quick wash machines and dryers. I find it to be a bargain.< /text>

There is something about a welcoming laundromat. When you walk in the place, it almost feels like you’re at home. It’s quiet and Miss Lottie is always so welcoming. The place is always so clean and the machines always work. They definitely have my business. Thanks!<//Review>

Gosh, I CANNOT EVEN begin.  It was the VERY first time I've done my laundry here because ours broke and out of luck, I found this laundromat on Google.  I needed to wash my sheets, blankets, etc. and pretty much needed to find one that closes late.  Anyway, long story short, my son lost his 24k gold necklace which holds a huge sentimental value in it.  He told me that he might've gotten it caught in one of his blankets when he took it off.  I pretty much lost sleep because of this and contacted the owner around 2am (left him a few messages at that 😭), told him what had happened and he reached back to me early a.m. that same morning and he reassured me that he was going to help me find it by looking through the drain.  He even went through his camera's to see who was the first person in (one of his workers) and asked her if she'd seen it, which she didn't.  Anyway, moral of the story is that this laundromat's owner is AMAZING!  He truly goes beyond for his customers just to help them out - he didn't HAVE to do that BUT he did!

Last but not least, his laundromat is SUPER clean, very quiet, and good people around.  You truly do NOT see a speck of dirt in his bins!  I will forever be a loyal customer!

Thank you!

(Found the necklace in the car BTW 😒)< /Text>

Going to the laundromat to wash comforters was the last thing I wanted to do...but it turned out to be a great experience! Lake Merritt Laundromat is friendly, spacious, comfortable and squeaky clean!! The pride of ownership in this facility is exceptional! The manager, really goes the extra mile to be kind and helpful. He works hard in maintaining the high standards of Lake Merritt Laundromat. I give them an A+!!  😃</review>

<Text>This is a really great place to do laundry and study. I have been going here every weekend for the past 6 months and the place is always clean and the machines are always working. It’s also great because of the coffee shop next door so you can have a latte and read a good book while you wait. The staff is always very helpful and friendly as well.<//Text>< user_id>

<Date>1491420821929</Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>So I rarely review anything on yelp, but I had to take the time and share my experience here (while I wait for my dry to finish).  This laundromat is very close to my place, but I usually went farther out because of the broken machines. This month I noticed a New Ownership sign out front so decided to take a look. There is no comparison to how it was before. Aesthetically it is really comfortable. New paint, new wooden accent wall, a TV with Netflix!  I mean I do not enjoy laundry day but this makes the time fly. On a more important note, all the machines are functioning. So instead of waiting and waiting I can get my clothes done pretty quick. New owners are often here, and they say new machines with card pay options are coming soon. Even gave me a few quarters for my dry. It's good to see that people care to make the community better. Everyone has laundry and this place is the spot to get it done.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1491699472004, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words.

<Text>I was in Texas recently for an 8 day trip. Halfway through, I took my clothes in for the wash and fold. They were returned to me quickly (just a few hours) and were perfectly clean and perfectly folded. Staff was friendly and the price was less than I expected to pay only $1 a pound Super clean inside. I highly recommend Come and Wash It!<//Text>< name>

This Laundromat is a block form my house and I've been using it for 3 years.  Miss Lottie is Fantastic and is great for the community in general and the Laundromat in particular.
Why 1 star???  More than 50% of the machines have not been working for over 1 year.  And now more and more are broken down.  Example.  There are 9 medium sized washing machines.  2 work.
I spend about $10 week doing my laundry. Times 52 weeks a year is $520.  Until these machines are fixed, I will drive my laundry somewhere else.  I encourage anyone who can do this to protest this business until they provide a reasonable serve..< /text>

I have added free wifi and a TV with Xfinity. Also in March you will start seeing new machines arrive. They will be express washers that will save you time. There will also be all brand new dryers.

<review>During my Training in Oakland, Lake Merritt Laundromat we were using was questionable at best. I see all brand New Express Dexter washers and Express Dryers.. Without a doubt, it was the best service I have had in a long time. For a very reasonable price we dropped off our clothes and were able to pick them up, cleaned and folded, the same day. It allowed us to continue training without the hassle of fitting laundry into our already busy schedule. I would absolutely recommend them and will be returning if my training brings me to Oakland Again. Very Friendly!!< /review>< pictures>

Clean, standard prices ($3.25 for the "3 load" washer, $.25 for 5 mins in the dryer), 10th wash free when you use your credit card. Parking in this neighborhood is rough. Street sweeping before noon every second and fourth Tuesday. Super friendly attendant. No complaints!</Text>

Under it's new owner, this laundromat is wonderful. Everything is modern and works well. This is a far cry from the previous ownership when most of the machines were broken most of the time. Although I live nearby, I went elsewhere and mentioned this in a review.  The new owner reached out a few months ago asking me to give it another chance. I appreciated that, and now am back to this laundromat.<//Text>

<text>Former customer at Wesley here. Love what the new owners have done with the place. Have it a much needed makeover, and clearly their hard work shows. Everything is clean, and all the machines have worked smoothly for me. Nice bonus having the tv and free wifi!
Spoke with the new owners the other day, and they told me they have new machines on the way which will also take credit/debit/Apple Pay. They stop by the shop frequently to make sure everything is running without fail. Great spot with local owners!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1491699578490, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words.

I love wearing clothes but they're constantly getting dirty. I also hate spending my whole day doing laundry. This laundromat is the best in the bay. I can run 4-5 loads at a time and be done in about an hour.  Fast, clean, free wifi, flat screen TV, updated machines. Same wash&fold  as before. Bonus is it's a local family owned business.< /Text>

Best Laundromat in the Bay Area! Always very clean and they take Credit Cards! Even get your 10th wash free by using your credit card. Definitely safe to start your wash and walk to the coffee shop for some great coffee! They have a pizza place next door in the evening or a snack and soda machine as well. Miss lottie and Nikila are always down there to help or to wash your clothing if you don't have time for $1 per pound. Just absolutely love this place!</text>

< review>
This laundromat is discriminatory against Black customers, perhaps young Black customers. I came here to do laundry after seeing excellent reviews. I brought in my laundry and went back to get detergent and came back in to get my quarters. The attendant who is also Black seemed alarmed and immediately asked me WHAT I was doing in the laundromat...my first thought? Laundry...because it's a laundromat. I received no greeting. I told her I already brought my items in, then she said "oh," and turned away. As I loaded the laundry I watched how she worked. She's checking in on White and non Black folks, smiling in their faces, greeting them as they walked in. Then a non-Black man came in to use the vending machine and left. So I spoke up..."Is he a customer? You didn't ask him why he was here." She then says that she was just asking me if I was washing and she didn't see me come in the first time and he was a regular customer. She then insinuated that I, a young professional Black woman, should have greeted her when I walked through the door but here she is smiling ear to ear for White folks who aren't offering her so much as a hello. On top of that, before I spoke up, she passive aggressively told a non-Black girl that "people are just too sensitive these days," meaning she knew I peeped her prejudice. So sad to see other Black people with a bias against skinfolk. I don't appreciate the insinuation that I was trying to take their quarters. I don't spend in cash and I'm DEFINITELY not paying in quarters. I have a bank account and a credit card...Just FYI keep in mind when you go here, this is a gentrified neighborhood and so is the laundromat. On top of that? This place is EXPENSIVE and the machine didn’t return all of my change. $20 for two machines plus drying. Never coming back. Peace.I’m updating this review because after I left it the attendants manager called her and then she made a scene arguing with me in front of all of the other customers telling me I needed to tell Derrick (I’m assuming this is her manager that she isn’t prejudice [she is.]) So not only is the attendant unwelcoming but she’s unprofessional and I’ll be reposting this review until I receive an apology because apparently her manager told her everything was OK. (It wasn’t.) And on top of that their 5 dollar washer didn’t even fill up with water to wash my clothes. I lost my money, an afternoon and I was harassed by the attendant here. I’m going to go out on a short limb and say she would have felt it was ok to argue with me if I wasn’t Black. Totally unprofessional.

——————————
Your attendant isn’t racist she’s descriminatory and the assumption that I’m stealing quarters but White patrons are not proves that and your response shows that you condone this abhorrent behavior, including her charging towards me and inciting an argument and causing a scene in front of all of your patrons. It’s not a surprise to me that there are not only no Black people leaving reviews but also no Black people in the laundromat itself. We aren’t welcomed here unless we are working. This is NOT how you handle such a serious complaint. Now what I’ll be doing is filing a complaint with the state of California, good luck as well I’m not only paying for that but continuing to pull the YELP review after I keep reposting it. This was NOT an apology.< /review>

<response>{'time': 1530227464722, 'text': 'Well I can most definitely assure you that Miss Lottie is not racist. The reason she asked you about the quarters was because people have been coming in lately and taking the quarters and leaving with them. On surface it might not seem like a big deal, however, it happens frequently and then we are forced to go to the bank to get a lot of quarters. When our business runs mainly off quarters then it hurts our business. Having said that, I am sorry you had a bad experience with our Laundromat and I wish you well in your search for a new one.'}< /response>< GmapID>

<text>I don't normally take to much time for reviews, but I had to on this experience. I will say I was a bit annoyed at the process of signing up, very slow, but I needed a fridge and this was my only option. Once all said and done the process was painless and finally after 2 weeks the fridge arrived tonight.
The delivery drivers is my main reason for this post. They went absolutely above and beyond for me tonight. I was almost in tears because this fridge almost didn't fit and they weren't sure it could be done. Thankfully they took the extra time and made it work. You have no idea how bad this would have been if it didn't fit. I didn't get their names, but THANK YOU!!!! if I could have tipped them a major amount of money I would have. What I had doesn't even come close to showing my gratitude. That's why I'm hoping this review will be seen by the boss and he knows how amazing these guys are.< /text><Resp>{'time': 1577651722880, 'text': 'We are happy to hear that!

< review>
The delivery system was really messed up. They didn't have any of the electronics like 55 inch TVs and xbox ones not even in their boxes. And the tv was broken during delivery and the driver lied and said he plugged it in and tested it when he didn't  I give then 0 stars< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Horrible company to work for, misleading to its employees. Was going to move my niece, her husband and two young kids to arcata (somewhere they have never lived or know anyone there) to run a store that was closing down in 3 months which is something they did not inform them, thankfully they caught on and confronted management about it because my nieces husband and family would’ve been left with no job in 3 months probably no home in a place they have never lived nor know anybody there. Will never do business with Aaron’s again.< /Text>< response>

<text>I have bought a washer and dryer from Aaron's and paid it off. This time i took advantage of the 25 payment for a month on a 2 piece sectional. That was 2 weeks ago, I have called a couple time and still have not gotten my couch. What a deal they are offering, 25 dollar payment for one month but they fail to mention you will not get your stuff or if at all. Now i need to get my money back and try Rent A Center to see if they actually value customers.

UPDATE: Just to update, i went in for my refund and the manager at Aarons took care of that long wait with a sectional set delivered that day. So i do appreciate him making that right, it goes a long ways for the consumer.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I came in today for a sale that was going on.
I was helped by two ladies.  the lady with longer dark hair had called me her "babe"
I would like to state that not only did she know I am married, but this was EXTREMELY unprofessional.
She has made not only I, but my wife uncomfortable.
I will be asking for a different representative anytime from now on.
I had no clue such unprofessionalism was allowed.
I am currently waiting for a delivery, and I hope that you take note to this and help us avoid coming in contact with this employee.
I have never experienced this disrespect from a employee, this definitely caught me off guard.< /text>< pics>

My husband and I purchased a big screen tv and entertainment system on credit and were making 250 dollar payments monthly. Last tax season we paid the debt off in full, but now they are claiming that we are 600 dollars behind and that we owe for 16 months still. I am so upset with them. Keep proof of your payments because they obviously can’t keep their records straight< /Text>

Amazing customer service. Used them as a middle man for an FFL transaction and ended up buying several parts for my build as well. The worker threw in an extra part free of charge and gave some advice for the build. Would recommend for anyone local needing a firearm or purchasing one needing transfer services.< /text>

<Review>There was a strong vibration when driving my 4Runner at speeds over 40mph. Dustin replaced the U-Joints which solved the issue, and also replaced the car battery which was dead, all at a very fair price. A+ Service! I highly recommend this shop< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>I recently ran over a nail in almost brand new large truck tires, luckily it was not through the sidewall. I decided to call Valley Tire & Tackle in Fort Jones to see if they had time and the ability to repair my tire. They said it would be super quick and that yes they could fix it for around $10+ dollars.

So I went in around 45 minutes later. They quickly took the truck back into the shop and went about removing the tire and getting to work. After about 15 minutes they were done. They brought my truck back out front and told me no charge - on the house this time. So I gave the worker who helped a few dollars as a tip.

Overall, my first experience with them was fantastic. Customer service was outstanding, price (if I paid) was more than reasonable, and its local which I love to support where possible. I recommend giving these guys a call first before heading up to Medford or Yreka - give them a chance to earn your business. I will be returning.</Review>< Pictures>

I was refused dervice to balance tires because the tires were purchased online. I was told "we lose business if you don't buy the tires here". Well, he lost business anyway.

I am very disaappointed to be treated by a business this way in this very small community.< /Text>

place doesn't have much of a selection for rental tux.  only three were available when I went. Michael Khors tux was decent but when I asked for more options the guys attitude changed and was trying to force me into something I didn't like. I told him I would go somewhere else to check my options and right away he asked where I was going. they got rude and  told me that mens warehouse is over priced and that they're going out of business and I will waste my time over there.  went to mens warehouse  found a better tux for about 20 dollars more. but customer service was way better. I recommend buying your own shoes, shirt, and jewelry when going to any rental company. the ones rental companies provide are usually very cheap quality and it shows.</review>

This place is awesome! D-Train is the manager and besides his cool name he is even cooler. A total professional and great at what he does. You need a tux? Come to the one in Downey so you can experience it yourself.< /Review>

<text>Everyone at Friar Tux in Downey are so helpful. My husband picked the suits for our wedding with the staff at this location, the groomsmen were able to get their measurements done on their own schedules, and pick up and drop off was a breeze. Absolutely recommend going here for your tux and suit needs!< /text>< pics>

The people were amazing with my son and his monkey. Not only did you guys have plenty of patience with the 14 guys I took to rent one tux you guys answered all of our questions. The day I picked up the tux the girl gently put it in the monkey and made sure it was a good fit. My son's expression was priceless. Not only did the tux fit my son perfect it also look good on the monkey. You have a forever customer<//review>

< Review>
The initial visit for choosing the suit and the fitting  went well with Andrew (just a bit of a wait because the ratio of employees per customers is way off) I expressed to Andrew how URGENT my pick up date for the suit was (gave them 1 full week) and when I called 1 day before the pick up date to verify all was ready,  I was told my order had been CANCELED!! Yes I panicked but the Assistant Manager, Lori assured me our suit would be ready the next day (I was never told how my order was canceled in error) Upon picking up the suit, the pants were shorter than agreed but by then, I didn't have time or the trust in them for additional-same day alterations. I was refunded my $12 for hemming charges BUT was told my dissatisfaction would be mentioned to Lori who would call me but that call NEVER came. With such important events for such attire, the unnecessary stress was not appreciated.  Sorry Friar Tux you've lost my business.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>For our wedding back on 9.30.17, your location was amazing!!!!! I mean, all that was needed was offering champagne, because seriously the manner in which you waited on all of us, including customers that would come in, was the best! Super attentive, super friendly, approachable and great feedback. I walked into the location with my husband because, duh, it was my wedding, my pictures, and I wanted to be involved and looking for the boys to look amazing. Having the young gentleman take the time to try all different type/color/style shirts on a mannequin and adding the different vests was great! Not once did either of us feel like we were a burden, nor did I get the vibe he wanted me to hurry and make a decision none of that. The entire time he was super helpful and had a smile on his face and was just walking back and forth, back and forth. It seriously felt like he felt the same passion as I did with making it the best day of my life. I applaud you Friar Tux in Downey. I applaud you. Great job!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Great experience, went in on a wed to rent a suit that I needed for a wedding on a Friday and they we able to help me out no problem. Got fitted next day it was ready to try on and take home. I was worried because I'm a big guy I wore a sz 62 so knowing they had big sizes was a big realief. I definitely recommend this place  to anyone looking for a suit rental for something formal< /Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>Went here to rent a tuxedo for my wedding and 5 groomsmen. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and the best part was that some of my groomsmen couldn't pickup and do the fitting at this particular one so they scheduled to have it done at one close to their home. The tuxedo was in pristine condition and the price was not too bad. Overall a great experience for my wedding and rent. Highly recommend< /review>< user_name>

Get ready to wait when you come in, even with appt. Place is busy & people that pick up takes priority than people that needs to be fitted. Price is reasonable compare to other tux rental place & people are nice, friendly & enjoy the work they do.</review>

<Date>1516123539831<//Date><Review>I really like the attention to customer service. I've used Friar for my wedding and unfortunately, funerals. For my wedding, they made it incredibly easy to have my groomsmen send in fittings measurements despite them being in different parts of the country thanks to their national network. For a recent funeral, they had a tux ready for me in a same-day request within a couple of hours (I don't think they do that much, but they knew I was in desperate need and expedited the request). Sylvia, the store manager made the experience truly exceptional!

One can assume that because it's a small store, one will receive a "small store" experience, but it is the complete opposite. Going to Friar Tux is like visiting a Nordstrom or an In-N-Out, in terms of customer attention. Highly recommend!<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< Pictures>

<text>This morning walked in and met Silvia - manager. She greeted the bride and groom and myself the best man. Now she was detailed in explaining everything. Very helpful in color matching and she knew her stuff. If you ever need a tuxedo i surely recommend her.

January 25th Update final fit everything just right. All I have to say is exceptional customer service. If you seriously need a tuxedo for any occasion you need to visit this location. Thank you Sylvia, Sarah (sara), loralee (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) for best service I received.<//text><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

I have been going here for all my main events tbroughout my time in Downey. I tried to return suspenders due to an overage of the purchase, and they refused after spending hundreds of dollars, they were rude, sarcastic & tried to make me feel bad about the return. I asked my friends & family to never make a purchase there again.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It's a great business there, very good attention from the staff is very kind I had not had the opportunity to go there before but now that I went to rent the suit for my son because he is going to be a chamberlain in a quinceañera it was a very good experience to go there it is a very nice atmosphere very good service I was very satisfied and my family too

<review>It was ok my nails were cute. Just a bit upset had to get everything done outside I know the virus and all. I just would've preferred my pedicure inside it's more relaxing with the spa tub and all vs a little basin. We were squeezed in last min appreciate that as it's hard stopping as a trucker to enjoy things like this. Only other issue my pinky nail fell off the next day so was bummed about that. But they were cute 🤗</review><UserId.>114156919935987486958</UserId.>< Rating>

<rate>1</rate><text>While getting my nails done the nail tech was rough and nicked me maybe twice. She was rushing and doing a really sloppy job. When asked if they could do what I requested she confirmed that she could and proceeded to do the complete opposite. When speaking with the manager I told her that I wasn’t happy with my nails and I also requested a different nail tech she then said yes. After they had me sit for like 10 min she gave me the same nail tech and when I said I wanted someone else she then denied me that and I ended up having the same lady. I told her I wanted my nails fixed and all she did was take off the polish and added more acrylic. My cuticles were not fixed they are flooded still and my nails are crooked I’m very unhappy with the service and they were very unprofessional. I do not recommend them to anyone.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Amazing every time I go I go with Wendy and she is amazing today I went with somebody else but I didn't catch her name and so they are pretty awesome there's just one person that I don't pretty much care for it's a guy but there's not many of those which I just don't go to him so yeah they're pretty amazing and I get what I paid for every time</text>

<review>I called 15 minutes ahead and said if I’m there in 10 minutes will you be able to see me? Is it busy? And they said no if you come now we can help you. I show up 10 minutes later and she tells me it’s a half hour wait. Mmm, no thanks.< /review></record>

<text>I been coming to this place for 8 years and it has changed completely the last two years. The service is bad, they personally overprice, specially the head nail tech Wendy, and the quality of their products are cheap. My mother tried doing the dip powder to reserve her nails and within three days her nails were chipping. When I brought it up to the nail tech all she did was ask who did my moms nails. Not once offered to fix it. Another visit I asked for white tip nails and noticed that Wendy charged me 10$ more than what the price said on the price board even though I came in with my nails already cut, with no polish and did not ask for gel. I catch myself leaving disappointed every time I get my nails done at this location and I’ve had enough. It’s time to move to a different location.</text>< Resp>

They did a beautiful job. I was stuck between two acrylic colors and she helped me figure out which on I liked better by actually trying it on a separate nail. She made sure everything was perfect before putting on gloss.< /Review>

<Review>I came in with preshaped nails for them to paint, so it would be a regular manicure. They overcharged by a lot. But besides their overpricing, they don’t paint nails right. I wanted an ombré, all white with glitter. 💆‍♀️ It was extremely bulky on the tips and it completely ruined the shape I came in with. I had to file my nails down by some cm. I was so sad. They also moved me right after I got my pedicure, which ruined one of the toes because it wasn’t dry. I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible because the quality of service was so bad :(</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Salome Kae<//username></record>

< review>
Went today for 2 pedicures and a full set (for my daughter who's 12 got them done fir a wedding) pedicures were great but when the lady brought the bill 38 for my daughters full set. 38?!!! For what? Well I go and ask why she said gel and powder. Ummm, excuse me we didn't ask for that. Then another lady says 5dollar discount for you if you want the powder . ummm nooo!!  Dont try to give me something I didn't ask for and expect me to pay for it.  So ended up paying 28 for her nails. So be sure you are being charged for what you want and not for something you didn't ask for.</review>

<Review>I went to do my nails and I felt so uncomfortable. Kim was doing my nails and I will never go back there again. Good nails just worse service. I already have low self esteem I don’t need people talking the whole time and looking at my feet laughing. Also she asked me to tip so felt obligated to tip. Wish I hadn’t.<//Review><user_id>118262854263546565601<//user_id>< Name>

Extremely rude. My mother and 3 year old daughter went here. Long story short, my mother had asked for a cup of water for my daughter and the worker replied rudely "can you wait?". My sister vouched on rudeness and the staff is very pushy on trying to add designs on your nails even if you tell them you want a solid color.<//review>

This place is bad first time, (for pedicures and manicure and gel color $39.00 and $1.00 fee for debit card)and I asked for lavender and when they pull out the nail polish it was old and clumpy and the brush didn't even take the color In to my nail, so she put more water in the nail polish bottle. Then the pedicure was so cheep no massage just put small amount of lotion on my feet then she ask for more money as for scrape some skin witch I don't have so I said no thanks. So putting the nail color bad old and clumps on my feet then it was really bad and she lie she said it was gel it wasn't it was just clear nail polish on top of the old nail polish. She lie. Manicure awful same color bad on my nail not massage and bad attitude. One of my nail didn't take the color the I told her she said so Gary I put the oil already. So I told her fix it this people are liar and they are very cheap with there product. To much money for old cheep and full service. You want to waist money and have bad service please go there.
I will never ever go to them ever bad service and liars.......<//Review>

< Review>
I love Loan, the main girl there. I think she's the manager. I've been getting acrylic nails for 25 years and am extremely picky, and she does a fabulous job.  I can't vouch for the job the other girls do, but Loan is great. I live in Glendora, work in Riverside, and I always get my nails done in Riverside even though there are about 5 nail salons within a half mile of my house.  No complains about Diamond nails at all!</Review>

< review>
so first of all i went in for a gel manicure and the lady was so rude, my nails look so bad that my coworkers asked if my 2 year old daughter did my nails but i didnt make a big deal of it and just kind fixed them with nail polish remover. Today they started getting stuck on my hair beacause the gel was lifting so as i started removing them i noticed green on MY NAIL now i can possibly have fungus !!!!!< /review>

I went in for a design that was on their Instagram, first of all I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance confirming the day before so that the lady could be 45 minutes late. Then she tells me that I should not get the design I went in for because it was posted just for looks. Continued to tell me negative things about the design until I decided on something else that I've gotten in the past and was over priced. Went in feeling good to get pampered for my birthday and left unsatisfied.<//review><name>Vivian Gonzalez< /name><resp>None< /resp><Date>1447531989342<//Date>< Rating>

Super horrible, lady changed my nail color, missed sides of my nails! They did my mother’s and they left a side of her nail drippy and the other side dry with not much product on them! And they were too expensive for such ugly nails, don’t recommend going there at all!</review>

<Review>Do Not go here !!!!!!!! They are overpriced and you don’t even get what you ask for ! They file your skin more than they file the nail. My cuticles are sore and tender because of it. Only waited 5 minutes to be served but it Should never take 4 hours for a full set and color change , only came here because my regular nail shop was closed today. NEVER AGAIN !</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>I got a gel pedicure last week. The employee was very kind, however, it ended up costing $10 more than it should have. The gel was very sloppy, too. I might come back and get it redone.< /text>< pictures>

I called before coming in & they told me a Gel Pedicure is $22 and a regular is $17. The REAL total should’ve been $39, They tried charging us $51... where did the extra $12 come from? Very unprofessional, don’t recommend</text>

Had an amazing experience here and my salesman Ricardo Hernandez was so incredibly helpful! I was approved within minutes and was able to take my car home the same day. He helped me with my application and made sure that everything was perfect. Overall this is the best dealership I have been to.< /Review>

<review>Ganas Auto is a high end Buy Here Pay Here financing source who helps customers who have been turned down at traditional dealerships.  With over 250 quality vehicles that come with a 12 month / 12,000 mile Warranty available for their short term financing program, you will be surprised how easy it is to work with their Finance Specialist and Branch Manager on your custom approval and vehicle selection.  I highly recommend Ganas Auto vehicle financing.</review>< pics>

These guys are all hype, don't get me wrong they do work with all types of credit but they don't negotiate well with their deals. They won't go any lower than a $2,900 down payment even on the cheapest car.. which still goes for about $17,000. All the cars they have in stock are sold for $6,000- $8,000 above market value. They tried offering me a 2010 camry with over 120,000 miles for more than $16,000 when the value is less than 10k.

Also the sales reps don't know a lot about cars except if it has a v4 or v6 engine, didn't even know what power steer was or gas tank capacity.

DO YOUR RESEARCH before going here if you don't want to get ripped off or just avoid this place over all.<//text>

If you love to waist your time come here they dont answer phone calls after you buy a car . oh and if your car breaks down be prepared to drop off and pick up your vehicle at El monte. Which in my case it broke down only after 2 weeks. They do not communicated at all and the salers are no help after you buy the car  they dont care about the client afterwords . i had a horrible experienced after my vehicle broke down . nobody know anything . now all i want to do is pay off everything and have nothing to do with them. So be careful coming here!</Review>

I highly recommend this place for tennis racket restoration . My tennis racket is basically brand new. The owner/boss is extremely friendly and helpful. Additionally, he took the time to teach me about all the different types of rackets. I will definitely be coming back in the future.< /review>

Joey did a great job stringing my racquet with the right tension. i use a hybrid string requiring two different tensions for the main and cross strings. excellent service and quality of work overall.< /review>

<Text>If you love tennis and are looking for a local shop that has all the offerings of the popular tennis websites you visit and order from, look no further than the Tennis Factory.

I’ve visited twice already within a week, first to buy a couple of racquets and then to get some strings and both times it was the best experience in a sports store I’ve ever had. Joey knows exactly what he’s talking about in terms of suggestions and he’s a super super nice dude and his customer service is amazing.

Highly recommend him even if you are within a 25 mile radius. His shop is complete with every major brand, every major string, every sleeper string, every sleeper sleeper string and he even has badminton equipment as well. But that’s not the reason why this is a 5 star.

The reason why this is a 5 star is because Joey is a genuinely approachable guy. If you’ve gotten this far into this review just know this: Joey isn’t looking for you to buy the most expensive gear or anything like that, he simply wants to equip you with the best tools you want, at the most reasonable price possible because he too loves tennis.

He is a nice guy who loves tennis and that’s what makes this place amazing.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< UserId.>

<Text>This is a fantastic small tennis shop. Pricing on tennis accessories like grips and backpacks are pretty much in line with the cheapest online pricing. Selection can be a little light but they have a lot of the more popular products.

The service is fantastic. It's the best pricing I've found on good string jobs in the area. They're also very well stocked on different strings. Hyper G is around $24. They might take a day or two to get your rackets back but seem to be willing to work with you.

They also offer swingweight testing which is a huge plus. They were nice enough to test that for free for me when I got my rackets strung.

Overall it's a great local business. I'm happy every time I'm there.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Joey is by far the bestest, kindest, fastest, and most honest guy me and my bf have came across for our tennis needs!

We have bought rackets for a fraction of the price compared to other places.
Stringing price is reasonable and can make arrangements to have your racket strung that same day.
He even let my bf demo his own racket at some courts nearby to see if his racket (with same string type and same tension) would be right for him!!

His HONESTY! My bf was about to get new strings on his second racket amd Joey told him "I can say 'ok' and make more money, but you don't need it."

Check his store out, you won't regret it 👌🏻<//Review>< name>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I first came here last week to get my rackets restrung when I saw the very positive Yelp reviews. It was a bit late in the day, but Joey, the store owner, took his time to talk me through everything. I looked through the nice racket selection (the store has all the new models) and we talked about life and tennis. He stayed past closing to finish stringing both rackets as well. Joey was extremely considerate. I came by again when my racket string got damaged and he was very helpful then too. The prices here are also quite competitive, and I got a brand new racket as well! So come take a look for yourself and see what this place has to offer.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>I love kind delivery. I always tell my local friends to order through them. I want to give a shout-out to my super kind & bubbly previous driver, Justine, she was amazing! My order always comes perfectly packaged with a receipt. Always go through them for your 420 needs.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Definitely the fastest delivery service available and on top of being quick they have the best selection and are open the earliest. They have so many different products, in every flavor and style too. Completely an amazing experience from start to finish.</Text>

<Time>1617992134895< /Time><text>This was my first time using this delivery service and it was seamless! I will definitely be a returning customer. Their selection is better than Eaze, prices are about the same, but it's the service where they really excel. The ordering processing is much smoother than Eaze, there's no weird international fee, Kind Delivery contacts you via phone to confirm your order after placing, which I love, and the driver Travis (I hope that's right! I waited too long to leave the review) was excellent ! Super friendly and professional, and a joy to chat with. As far as the actual delivery process goes, you can leave notes to advise about gate codes, dog situations, they will come up, or you can meet them outside, etc. Overall, I'm thrilled and will definitely be returning :)<//text><user_name>Dreamy Tabby< /user_name><gmap_id>0x80dc99e0129ec639:0xe80ea1b996ce084e<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

A+ A+ A+!! AMAZING SERVICE! OUR #1 GO 2 SPOT! Professional, Consistant and Great Communication! My wife and I loved this place and not only are the products the best but the people! Jaqueline(Jackie) was an amazing bud tender with a great amount of knowledge to help me better my decisions and was nice enough to help with a personal request! Our driver Justine was very caring and again had a great deal of knowledge on products to help my wife with her medical condition. I WISH I COULD TIP THE WHOLE STAFF!!! A+ A+ A+ A+<//Review>

Never had a worse experience from a dispensary. I wouldn’t go to this place in person because even if you pick curbside they still charge you “cannabis taxes” so you cant get around over paying. Also when we came to pick up our order they made us wait at least 30 minutes until i just got out of my car and asked the security guard what was going on. Then the guy finally came out with my order and when i offered to pay with debit, like it says on the website, he had to run inside and grab the card machine. After another few minutes he walks back outside and scans my card and then said that “he had some trouble with this machine so he would go get another one.” Honestly after that I looked up the closest dispensary and when i called they told me i could walk right in and get 40% off everything too! Lesson for the day, GO TO SYNDICATE!<//review>

Our friends at the Syndicate also charge the same tax. All legal dispensaries, store front or delivery have to charge that tax.\nHappy to hear you were able to find what you were looking for there.\nHave a great 4/20.'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Kind delivery always exceeds  my expectations! The customer service is on point here! All the bud tenders are super knowledgeable and take the time to listen to my needs and wants.Wait times are always reasonable and if the driver takes longer than expected they give you call and update your ETA which is unheard of. Kind is the place for any and all your marijuana needs!< /text><gmap_id>0x80dc99e0129ec639:0xe80ea1b996ce084e<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

<user_name>Morgan Whitehackle</user_name><review>Ok, I have use Kind about 4 times. The only time I had an issue was 2x most recent over a week ago. I had placed an order in the morning 11:28am to be exact and the bud tender showed up at 2:40pm, which was way over the 2hr period they claim to deliver within. So I called them and they acknowledged they totally forgot me or put me last on the route. They just said that they were to busy. Also I will note , to double check the date on the flower purchased- some of irons old.< /review>< user>

Dude never even showed up. Estimated delivery time was 30-120 minutes. Waited 3 hours and hadn't heard from them. Called and they told me it would be another hour.  Another 2 hours later and haven't heard from anyone. What a joke.  Go elsewhere.</Review>

<Review>You know, I’ve never been on live television before, but if I had the opportunity, the first thing I would say is that I buy all my cannabis from HERE. This is the place! And I’m not saying just saying that because they carry my favorite Wonderbrett strain, or the fact that this service always has an ever evolving selection of incredible products, but because the customer service is FAR BETTER than anywhere else. When they said that they are the Kindest service around, they meant that, and I FELT THAT. This place just hits different.

Funny story, I ordered something and the budtender said his name was Tanner, he had the most calming yet also very DEEP voice and I thought I was getting interviewed on a radio show or something haha. He helped guide me through my entire order but I had some other questions in regards to products and he was able to get me on the phone with one of their incredible managers, who also was named Tanner! I thought it was a funny coincidence but this guy was also so informative and was able to recommend some great prerolls for me and my Romanian lover, Esther. This isn’t even the best part, the delivery driver that showed up to my house, ALSO NAMED TANNER!!!! He was also amazing but it proposed a question in my mind, do they only hire Tanners? I wanna know!

All funny stories aside, this place is IT!!! But a friendly tip, due to their INCREDIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, this place is getting so popular that they have had to extend their wait times from time to time. All good and WORTH THE WAIT. The budtender and driver interactions alone are a good enough reason to order, and they always recommend the best products for your exact needs. Excellent communication, amazing products, A1 staff. See for yourself, they’re amazing.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Horrible Flower!! I had ordered based on the recommendation of the bud tender @kind it was Korova Sherb crashed x GMO and Wonderbrett Lemon OZK- definitely not ordering those ever again!!! The sherb has NO flavor and does not seem to be potent as they claim to be, but at least it was sealed. The Wonderbrett Lemon-OG was the worst, first off the flower taste awful(like mold) very disappointing  , the name is deceiving and it’s brand claims “Premium Taste” and the packaging for this flower is horrible- it comes in a box that is not Tamper proof, so I didn’t like that because the jar also did not come tamper proof or sealed and it felt awkward only seeing one small bud , and this is an $65 1/8 I paid for. Well rough night I suppose. I threw $159 in the garbage.Time to try someone else.!!</Review>

(Translated by Google) This place has what is generally needed at home at very good prices. The store is in a safe establishment and the schedules are very convenient. The staff is friendly, but most of the times I've come there are only one or two ATMs available so it makes the lines very long. It only receives three stars because the maintenance of the store is not very good. There are scraps and wrappers on the floor of the entire store.

Este lugar tiene lo general que se necesita en casa a muy buenos precios. La tienda está en un establecimiento seguro y los horarios son muy convenientes. El personal es amable, pero la mayoría de veces que he venido solamente hay uno o dos cajeros disponible así que hace las filas muy largas. Solamente recibe tres estrellas porque el mantenimiento de la tienda no es muy bueno. Hay deshechos y envoltorios  en el suelo de toda la tienda.< /review>

Ordered a make-your-own pasta and spaghetti/meatballs. The custom pasta turned out to be very good. The spaghetti with red sauce was just average. I did add a Caesars salad. Didn't know it was unlimited until I joked about getting another. Server did delivery another. To quote Homer Pyle, "Surprise, surprise, surprise."

I will say portions are large, so go hungry.< /review><username>Bradley Nakaji<//username>< rate>

The employee didn't pack the oil and vinegar for the bread. Didn't say anything about it. When I asked, she said they ran out yesterday. I don't think the traffic is high enough that they run out of oil and vinegar on a weekday. Liars in my opinion.
The actual food was good on taste and quantity.

I didn't say earlier but I have had items missing in the order before too, that's why I checked this time.

So my advice is to check your order for completeness before you walk out of the restaurant.< /text>

Very warm ambience. Food is good! Service very very slow if you are going with a large group. Staff gives good recommendations if you ask them. Usually very busy during lunch times on weekdays. I go here frequently for team lunches.</Text>

It's the worst pizza I have ever eaten. It felt like it was frozen and reheated! Definitely not fresh. The pasta had huge chunks of garlic(unminced) and the sauce was separated. I make better pasta at home! Felt like I was on Gordon Ramsay's kitchen nightmares episode. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL! I feel horrible after eating it argh!</text>< Pics>

<text>Really enjoyed the food. Really nice ambience and very friendly staffs. Been here for lunch and we ordered pastas. They have good varieties of pastas and pizzas. There were some more in the menu, but we did not checked anything other than pizzas and pastas. If you don’t like their options we can create our on pasta by choosing all the ingredients. They also have good list of wines and other soft drinks. It was not that crowded. It can accommodate plenty of people. You do not have to worry about the seatings. Parking is also not an issue as there are not much shops over that area.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVMMmFJgqOLaG9Xdbdmr4cfvxOJ_4NZ79uo0S2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyf2DnDjBjFeUUvTvQDQVlQqdLELo5155Xl-27=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmOOp18Tyv9hrk5UnCx1nd8exbfI3qD9PnL0OT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFmJn7jP9eYbZ-KQ82jDobjiqC1pdPUNmI1RxO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0koTviW1F4PczHhdqTgapvnf6e0i3OV-PbVLp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAybtES2s-VF6eBaGBmpQykEQvqLh26J7TvQ1T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDS8wF-FBeIADcDeVMjW-zMIIrH4OimrWImBrE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhkBNMBl6zI5BdlteMaNn6tnPohZjeiaBxgVqt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808fc8df6b0d67af:0x9d419fde15e00c1f< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The happy hour at this unique location is incredible! The prices are fantastic and the cocktail options are superb and artisan.

The nod to David Lynch in the corner was such a nice touch. A very cool atmosphere with neon lighting and comfortable seating.< /text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>Food was absolutely amazing, but I was slightly turned off by my most recent experience when our server told us complimentary bread could not be brought out with our salads and could only be served with our main plates. The server said this was a new 'restaurant policy'. If this is true, this will be the first time in my life food is held back in defiance of customer expectations. I have no idea why a restaurant would control when food is served to customers. We have not returned to this restaurant since we were informed of this new policy. The server lacked friendliness and seemed to not be mentally committed to the job at hand.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Our experience with Macaroni Grill was not good. We were not given napkins, cutlers even when the food came. We need to ask another server to get these. We didn’t get salt/paper too even after asking multiple times. Again we need to ask another server. Food was good, however we were sick of sloppy service by our server 🙁let me find receipt and upload.
Uploaded the receipt, server name is on that.< /text>

Everything (food, service, ambience) was great except the front desk attendant. Be prepared to wait for minimum 1 hour if you're going over weekends. Don't know the situation on weekdays but should be similar as this is famous place for corporate lunches as well.<//review>

<review>Rather rude experience today while trying to do a curbside pickup. I called upon arrival. The food was ready but they refused to step outside for curbside pick up because we did not click that option 2 hours back on the web.
Upon requesting for a curbside pick up at that time I got a rude refusal!
Not the best of experience.< /review>< GmapID>

It took more than 5 minutes after bring seated for server to come by. Food was put very long after order. (Only about 5 tables were occupied.) One of our orders had metal in it. (Guessing a piece of scrubbing pad). Chew your food.

<Text>The food was excellent as usual but the service sucked for a Friday night out with his friends. It took quite a while for us to get seated and conceded it took even longer to get water for the table. The restaurant was abnormally empty for a Friday night so there is some confusion as to why the service quality had declined. But for the sake of the food I would go back to this location.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr7CL_JqviqjsnSf7egJbJWpjKWtDuXkjMmJax=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1542043570545, 'text': 'Thank you for your honest feedback on your recent visit to Macaroni Grill.

<rating>3</rating><Review>Romano's Macaroni Grill was not that great. The food was just ok and the service was super slow. They definitely need more staff, our waiter was working so many tables, it took him a long time to get back to ours. We had appetizers, the Lobster ravioli, shrimp portofino, pepperoni pizza, and the spaghetti and meatballs. The restaurant itself was beautiful inside, but the food and service did not match, it was ok at best, so we won't be coming back here again.<//Review>< Pictures>

The service was ok but the rosemary bread they are famous was not fresh but was hard and had mold growing on it. We noticed couple of other tables also returning their breads. It was disappointing as it is one main reasons I come to macaroni grill. When we asked the server about the incident he just brushed it off and told us that it’s never happened before. The food we ordered again didn’t taste fresh my pasta was cold and had to reheated. Definitely will not be going to this place again.< /Review>

He was clearly hitting on her and made her very uncomfortable. Waiters came to our table twice with the wrong food. Waited a long time for anything to be served to my table including beverages and bread. The quality of the food was okay. Bathroom was filthy.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>One of the fine Italian restaurant in town. A must go place for food lovers.
Generally crowded and may have 15 mins waiting over the weekend or Friday lunch. No problem in parking at all lots of empty space.
Thought interior are little old but food is awesome.< /text>< pictures>

Food tasted good except for the steak was ordered at medium rare and it was well done and chewy. First time eating here and don’t know if I will again.</Review>

Enjoyed dinner very much. It's a good size portion for the build your own pasta. I had capellini with a pomodorina sauce, roasted garlic, roasted mushrooms and sundried tomatoes with ricotta meatballs and smoked provolone. It was excellent. We had a coupon for buy one pasta build and get one free. Had enough leftovers for a 2nd meal.</text>

Huge disappointment. We had a party of 15 going to the restaurant with a reservation. We didn't get a waiter until around 15 minutes for some reason. We ordered our drinks and appetizers and that came out. However, they didn't provide us with utensils or plates until after asking 3 times. We then ordered our meals after waiting another 15 minutes for a waiter to take our orders.  We ordered 5 Steak and Potatoes only for the waiter to tell us that they had 1 normal steak left and that they would have to use porterhouse steaks instead. One of us tried to get the steaks at the same price, but we couldn't get it at the normal steak price so 4 of us had to change our orders. The food came out at a comfortable pace, but there weren't any potatoes for the steak and potatoes, which the waiter didn't notify us about. Another complaint was that a person ordered pork chops, but it was pink when it should have been completely cooked. The restaurant took that off the bill. Overall, the experience was not great and the service was satisfactory.
TLDR: Slow service, no normal steaks and no potatoes for the steak and potatoes, and  a pork chop that was not fully cooked.</Text>

<text>Service was ok, there's def room for improvement. We waited alot. We sat near the kitchen, a lady name Rosie was preparing all the appetizers, soups, salads and desserts. She was so awesome at her job! She definitely deserves a kudos, she works really hard! Food was great, calamari fritta was so good! I had chicken porcinine (I forgot spelling 🤦🏻‍♀️) and my friend had steak and potatoes, we both enjoyed our entrees. For dessert we tried the tiramisu, yes!! I love the warm bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar too.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFPXIuEbTv6G-WrIDmZuNqDYhNOGxIwwgr4R8z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeRG1Kr_d6SCztREWqWzaqpMsUgCeuKsPoWyrP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdWU65U6aYn2_wten5iopNNTxR3yWHugAtTiE7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

I recently ordered food for delivery. I ordered a pasta dish with roasted chicken. The chicken was dry and hard. It was so over cooked it was unedible. I had to pick out all the chicken and throw it out. I wasted my money ordering from here.

Never ordering again.<//text>

We really did not have a good experience there. Our bread and pasta were cold, dry and much different that what I was expecting for a best Italian cousin in USA in 2016.</Review>

Great place to sit down for a filling meal. Food was delish and our servers were mindful to come by often to check on us. Odd thing about this place was the center aisle walkway. You had the navigate through servers as walk through the restaurant. Also, they had politics on the televisions (distasteful in my opinion). Otherwise, overall it was a good experience but not 5 star worthy.</review>

Also tried calamari. It was traditional.

You had no record of my confirmed online reservation. Bathroom hand paper towels for Christmas dinner seem tacky. The service was awfull. We expected the advertised special dinner menu and were told everything was sold out. I had to find my own vinegar to use at my table. I had to find my own pepper for my Cesar salad. Server never checked with us about our meal.

I used to dine at Macaroni grill weekly some years ago. I guess restaurant has go downhill in recent times.< /review>

<Review>It's been an all-time favorite restaurant of mine since they opened. I've never had anything bad to say until tonight. Bread was stale. Waiter didn't know the menu and told us that the side with the pork chops was a veggie, so my husband got an additional side of potatoes, then the side turned out to be a rice dish. Bar didn't know how to make a make a Mai Tai.  Even my Caesar salad had very little lettuce and way too much dressing</Review><resp>{'time': 1578505810945, 'text': 'Michelle, we are sorry to hear about your recent experience at Macaroni Grill and would like to know what we could have done to improve.

It was fair or more so less than, in comparison to the quality of the food we are use to there. Soup cold, 1st loaf of bread hard like it was reheated in a microwave.  We did receive a new hot bowl of soup and fresh bread,  waiter provided very good service.
The bathroom had no paper towels or dryer for our hands. Note this wasn't a rush hour dinner time, it was slow. Also, the entrees was mediocre, the texture and taste was almost tasteless!  We r very disappointed and this was one of our favorite restaurants.<//text>

Update: Romano's responded to this review stating they wanted to hear more about my experience and asked me to go to their website and fill out information.  I did this and have received no phone call nor any email response.  So, clearly just a social media monitor responding that has no power to actually fix the situation.

Not what it used to be.

Overpriced for what it is.

Waiter was less than thrilled to be serving us.

Nonetheless, the food was pretty good.< /Review>

< Review>
This is not the same place that it used to be. I was here recently on a Friday evening and the tables were 50% full, a far cry from the days where people would be waiting to be seated. I was surprised but soon understood the reason. The service here is below par and consistently my waiter and the waiter at the next table messed up our orders. They weren't even apologetic and just brushed off and blamed someone else.
The food quality is ok but they have serious issues that need to be addressed immediately.< /Review>

On a slow afternoon day, they definitely do not have the bandwidth to take groups of 14 ppl. I went to that restaurant for years since 1999 and never got such a bad , too long a wait...It took over 1h to get drinks , 15 min to get the table setup and 1:45min to get our drinks and 2h for our food... Furthermore some of the pasta was burned !?? What Italian high class restaurant burns pasta...  Suffice to  say being a customer for over 19 years is not what I would have expected.... It's usually such a nice place , now, I'm not so sure they want our patronship...</Text>

Online ordering will give you one price and you will receive another when you come in. It will also give you an eta which is totally wrong as well. If you question the cashier about it be prepared for a metric ton of attitude and to be blown off.</Review>

I reserved a table for 13 people 2 weeks in advance of dining date & stated we were celebrating a birthday.  Upon arrival at restaurant they had no record of my reservation; however, they were able to break down a table for 20 & accommodate us.  I placed birthday decorations around the table.  One of the managers & the server knew who the birthday person was.  We had drinks, appetizers and entrees.  While seated the table behind us had employees who sang Happy Birthday in Italian to someone, so I assumed the same would be done at our table.  The food was great, but not sure what happened after that but we had to chase the server down to order a bottle of wine, then we flagged down a different server to come around with fresh parmesan cheese.  No one came by to refill water, no one came by after entrees were served to ask if all was okay.  Then we waited a good 10 minutes after eating to see if a birthday dessert and song would take place, but never happened, our server continued to walk by to attend to other tables and then we finally got his attention to bring the check.  reservation was 7:30 and it was almost 10:30 when we left.  Our tab was $500  and I was happy that gratuity was not included.  Usually we tip good service with 20+%, but not this time.  Food was good but still a little pricey for Italian food.<//Text>

This place use to be really good. Don't know what happened but things have gone downhill drastically. The food is expensive, the chefs in the kitchen just doesn't care about what plating. Quality of food that comes out of the kitchen is not worth what they're asking for. I use to be a regular. Now it's only on slim occasion.  You be the judge.<//review>

<Review>Had dinner here on Friday. The food was way way to salty. The olive oil they offer for the bread was so sower. Our main dishes were so salty we didn't even finish our food. I believe the cleanliness of any restaurant bathroom says a lot about the restaurant. That being said the woman's bathroom was disgusting! It smelled so bad and there was some weird white liquid smeared over the inside of the bathroom stall. It's been 5 days since our visit and my husband still has stomach issues from the lamb shank he had. NEVER EVER eating here again!<//Review>< Response>

Not crazy expensive. Great service. The ambience is also rustic and cozy with yellow bulbs. The food is always yummy. We are vegetarian and sometimes ask the chef to put something together which is not in the menu and are always taken care of. We love the make your own menu. The kids menu is also good. The bread, free, is divine. We'd pay and drive over just for that.

The 2 stars are for the service before being seated. We had a party of 8 and place was less than half full and the host told us we had to wait 15 minutes because we have 3 parties in front of us, but we were the only ones waiting to be seated. After 30 minutes of waiting and groups of 4 being seatedwe asked the host when will we be seated. The host replied with soon. Then we saw the team push done tables together and we were seated. Our waiter was very nice and took our orders right away.< /Text>

We came in on a Saturday at 1:35 pm. Given it was a slow time, but we had a group of 14 ppl and I'd never had such a bad experience in 19 years being a customer... The server took 15min to get tables setup, 1h to get drinks and over 1:45 min to get food order..... Furthermore some of the pasta was burned (pictures attached)... Suffice to say bringing my friends as a first experience wasn't too good...<//text>

Went there in the late afternoon. I was standing there for few minutes before anyone helped me. The staff weren't busy but no one offered to help. The manager came out later and was very courteous. Food waa average at most. It's been a few years since I last came. I got to say it was disappointing, mostly due to the service quality.< /review>

Terrible service. The server had a super flat personality not very personable. The chicken marsala was way overcooked. It tasted like rubber. I couldn't eat it, and the wine didn't arrive at the table until after the meal (almost). Needless to say, I do not recommend this place.< /Review>

My wife and I went here for the first time tonight. We waited an hour to be seated which was fine. After being seated, our server asked if we'd like something to drink. We ordered a glass of wine for my wife and a sparkling water for myself. It took 15 minutes for the drinks and he served us regular water first, one in a half broken glass!!!  The entire time the server handed everything from behind a bar rail. The soup was cold and the pizza crust was raw as was the second pizza. What a way to dine on Christmas night. We got up and left as others dining were having similar issues. Not recommended and will not be going back.<//Text>

<text>Great service. All the staff are nice, polite, and very helpful. However, the food here is pretty awful. Especially anything with bread. The chicken dish wasn't too bad, but avoid the pizza at all costs. The house bread smelled great. It was soft and served warm like it should be. But again, tasted bad. That being said, prices are very affordable.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Romano's Grill remains the only time in my memory that the quality of the meal decreased over time. It started with nice service, followed by fantastic appetizers. Small peppers stuffed with goat cheese and some pruccetta. The entrees however, fell terribly flat. A pizza that seemed stale, with no crunch or give at all in the crust, and rubbery meat, and pasta  questionable chicken.

As strange as it sounds, I would argue against ordering entrees here, unless I happened to get the two things on the menu they aren't good at.< /Review>< rating>

We arrived for happy hour and sat in
bar area at a table. Jennifer, the bar tender, let us sit waiting for 15 minutes before she brought us a menu. Then another 10 minutes to come over and take our drink order. When the food came it Jennifer delivered part of it and at least 10 minutes later Andrea Link, the service manager, delivered the remaining dishes. I could go on and on about the poor service, but it appeared to us that the restaurant was under staffed in our area. In Jennifer’ Defense, why did she have to deliver food from the kitchen area? This problem could have been taken care with a regular waitress working the tables. Never ate at a Macroni Grill before tonight. If I ever try one again, I hope it has better service. As this one failed miserably.
I’d go back for the happy hour menu, it was excellent. But that was the only highlight of our experience. Wayne<//Text>

< Review>
today 2/15/20  was terrible. 5 mins to get somebody attend at arrival. 15 mins waiting to order. the manager then assigns somebody who does not conne finally somebody else comes and start instead of apologizing by stating it's not his fault... blame it on the guy before!!! then 3/4 off meal frozen margarita hasn't yet arrived.  now the story is that and i quite "not my fault i put it in immediately. its the genius at the bar who hasn't started it yet,". when it arrives it is not frozen. they removed the margarita and seemed to have done a gesture. terrible service. the whole meal should have been credited. oh and the place was crawling with waiter but not many occupied tables. it's not that they were overwhelmed!!!!

on 6/1/19, they offer 20 minutes wait when most tables are free! terrible customer service and no efficiency!

the caesar salad that they at to the meal to charge more now came twice with essential no caesar dressing... and the waitress is not happy it was pointed out< /Review>

<Review>The quality is top notch even though it's a chain. They seem to be busy about half the time when we go. You'll end up paying a bit too much but the food is great.

The service had been fine but not stellar each time we visit, which matches our expectations. If you like macaroni grills in general, then you will like this location as they seem to be very consistent.

I'm personally I really big fan of the free bread loaf and their pizza. I always try to save some to take it home but never even make it out the door without eating it all.< /Review></record>

Took my mom there for her birthday.  Mom really enjoyed her meal (make your own pasta) and birthday dessert.  I had something that I was not a fan of, but the manager Lance offer to try something else, I accepted and made my pasta dish it was really good.  Lance is a good dude.  He made my moms birthday special by being so kind and providing good service to us.<//Text>

<review>We were very underwhelmed by our dinner here. They charge high prices for mediocre Italian food.
To start, we had a hard little loaf of uncut, cold, stale bread brought to us. The waitress never brought any more to us. There's a big bottle of cheap olive oil on every table. The crust on the bread was like a rock.
We had the brussel sprouts as an appetizer because they did not have our first THREE choices of appetizer- said they were all out. The brussel sprouts were quite good, actually.
For entrees, my husband got the Mahi Mahi. He was disappointed. The fish itself was NOT fresh at all, and the pesto was very lacking in flavor, and had way too much cheese. Overall a very bland dish that he didnt want to finish. I had the Butternut Tortellacci with tomato soup, which was a decent meal, but not terribly impressive. The soup was very bland.
We decided not to even try dessert.
The only reason this is three stars instead of two is that the service was very fast.
Number one thing to improve: hire someone who knows how to bake bread, and make it FRESH.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>It was the service and selection. I've always loved this restaurant but this wasn't a good trip. The server didn't explain or offer the salad/soup extras had no clue about what they were out of. At about 6-7 pm, should be nothing. We were given menus with different offerings on them they had zero soups available that were actually listed on the menu. We we informed that they were out of things 3 times and one was a main entree. The server didn't even offer a dessert menu. I will probably go to another location at some point but dang, I spent 94 bucks and I didn't even get what I wanted.<//review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>My wife and I originally found the Fresno location. However this restaurant is on point, the food is phenomenal you will not be disappointed. The prices are decent considering it's a really good restaurant with high quality food, and good service. The building is cookie cutter it looks exactly like the Fresno location, without a fireplace only difference I could find even the bathroom looked the same!!! but I'm not knocking it they have a good system and it must work well for them their food is superb my favorite dish is the chicken under a brick, unfortunately it doesn't come served under a brick! it's cooked under a brick and once again it is out of this world!!!< /text>< pics>

<Review>Asked for orange soda, got lemon.
Selected roasted mushrooms and got pale, uncooked mushrooms.
Selected broccolini, got two florets and about a dozen chopped stalks.
Selected arabiatta, no discernible spice.
Marsala cream sauce tasted like an Alfredo nothing sauce.

Rosemary bread was delicious.

Maybe a bad night? We’ve had excellent experiences in our hometown, so we were excited to visit an old favorite in a new town. A very disappointing night.< /Review><rating>2< /rating><date>1559451683155<//date><pics>None</pics>< gmapID>

Funny staff looks at you, does not even welcome you, and have to flag someone down just get some service. I can understand if they're busy, seems staff is more interested in flirting or texting than working. What is even worse, food has no taste and expect tips for poor service. Here is a tip save your money and go somewhere else.<//Review>

<Review>Place gets busy and parking lot has fast moving traffic coming from the light.  Getting a table took a while although tables were empty.  Food took a very long time to get served and temperature of the food was ok, not hot.  Service was not there from start to finish for us, did not know the details of menu items and was not engaged.  Place was very clean and staff was dressed neatly and were polite.< /Review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>
<user>105963293462082990981</user><Text>Good service, bad food, gross bathrooms.

This place used to be good, but evidently those days are long over. My food was late, but once it arrived, it was plated so horribly it didn't look remotely appetizing. The drinks were over iced and watered down.

It's amazing they've survived all this time but the competition is slim.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Name>

We were told there was no wait but yet we still waited 15-20 minutes so they can set up our table. The food was just okay...I've had better.

We visited with 2 adults and four kids. The location was kid friendly. The staff and service was great and very attentive. There were a wide variety of menu options. The bread that came before the meal was not warm which was a bit disappointing but that was the only negative and it did taste good. Obviously the mac and cheese was good as well as all the other dishes we tried like the ravioli. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.</review>

I love Macaroni Grill. The service is always consistently good, and so is the food. There's never too long of a wait to get your food. It all tastes fresh too. I would recommend making reservations when you go here though. I order the Shrimp Portofino, and it is excellent. If you're a fan of fish you should get the sole. I had a couple gift cards. I got them discounted because Macaroni Grill constantly has specials they run for 20-30% off their gift cards. If you sign up for their club they send you $5 off your next meal, which you can use anytime. I'd recommend signing up for their email club because they frequently send discounts and coupons. Yet another reason I love Macaroni Grill.< /text>

Father's Day, no reservations. 45 minute wait. Sat in the bar, 5 minutes and we had us a table.

45 minutes after being told 45 minute wait, we're done eating and back on the road.

Bartender super cool, great service, fast food. Plus happy hour pricing on drinks.

Delicious and hearty. These guys rock. 150 miles from the casa & feels like home.</Text>

Really tasty, good food.  And if you get on their mailing list, Macaroni Grill sends weekly deals on their specials. Some are two-for-one meals, and I always bring my friends for those.

Sometimes I'm lucky enough to get Jasmine as our waitress and she is always a delight.<//Review>

Also, the silverware was dirty.  The bread didn't come out until half way through the meal.
I used to come here often. But now,  I'll not be returning.<//Review><time>1532832016419</time><UserId.>104748074395260523643</UserId.>< Rating>

Pretty average this restaurant. Wouldn't hurt to try it once. But I'm sure you'd find better Italian chain restaurants. Limited options to work with. And for vegetarians it's just the 'build your own pasta'. All in all, pretty average experience.</Text>

Very bad experience. We had to wait a while to be seated, once seated, the waiter wasn't taking our order. The food took forever to come. The pizza we got was ice cold. This is not the same Macaroni Grill we used to love a few months ago. It's gotten much, much worse.< /review>

This review is for a Grubhub delivery.

The food was good and packaged well aside from the oil and vinegar cups for the bread having opened and spilled inside the bag.

I ordered the signature truffle Mac and cheese and crispy mozzarella bites. The crispy mozz bites seemed like they had been way overcooked as they were all hemorrhaging dry, fried mozzarella and the insides were hollow.

My biggest problem however was ordering pasta from a restaurant whose menu consists primarily of pasta dishes, and not getting ANY silverware or napkins. How was this missed?? I had to call down to the front desk of my hotel and have someone bring a fork because no one at Romano's threw one in, and the Grubhub drivers don't stick around long enough to verify an order with the customer.

I disagree with the fundamental trend of sacrificing service for convenience and with a Grubhub delivery, I'm noticing no one takes accountability for an order. Sure, I can call the restaurant, but do I want to wait another 30 minutes for someone to drive back out to make my order right? This is compounded by the fact that my tip is pre-emptively applied so my one method of rewarding good service or highlighting bad is taken away from me.

I think both the restaurant and GH could do better. The restaurant needs to take better care with remote orders and ensure they are all 100% before going out the door, since problem resolution is much more complicated and time consuming; and I think GH as a service provider needs to emphasize *correct* service over *fast* service and incentivize workers at all points in the chain to follow suit.

I'm upset at RMG for not knowing their business and failing to include silverware to a hotel order for a food that *cannot* be eaten with hands, and GH needs to ensure orders that go through their process are correct before eating a customer's time and money. Next time I need to eat, I'll just go sit down at the restaurant. At least then when there's a problem, I can settle it immediately.< /Text>

Great service as always. Their bread is to die for and we always love the "made to order" pasta with lots of veggies. My only negative is that the two pizzas we ordered came cold...it wasn't even warm. They went back and reheated, but it wasn't the same as steaming hot. It was luke warm at best. So my only feedback would be to serve the pizzas hot - if it gets cold, don't bother to reheat but get fresh one.<//Text>

Party of six celebrating a birthday.
Service was attentive.
Large white sheets of paper covered the tables,  crayons provided for the young at heart.
For a Wednesday night, it was not crowded at dinner time, approximately 6 p.m.
3 of us had the chicken marsala. 1 had spaghetti and meatballs, shrimp scampi, and another had pasta alfredo.
The food was good, but not great in my humble opinion.
My chicken marsala was good but lacked the depth the marsala sauce typically carries.
The others in our party did seem pleased with their dish though.
Warm bread was served along with dipping sauce of spices and herbs in olive oil and balsamic vinegar may also be added.
It was very good.
The ladies room could be a bit more clean, and parking lot had a lot more cars than patrons.
We thought the place was packed judging by the cars in the lot near the entrance into the restaurant,  but only a couple of seated patrons.
Choice of chocolate cake or baked cheesecake with sliced strawberries on the side for the birthday girl.
I will most likely return to try another dish sometime in the future.</Text>

<Review>When my wife and I were first married, we used to save so we could go to one of our favorite places-Romano's Macaroni Grill! Then we moved away from any locations and have missed it.  Traveling through the area today, we were excited to see a RMG! We saw the reviews, but thought that surely they must be mistaken, this is Romano's after all...right?  Here's our experience.  The greeter was very friendly and courteous to us throughout the visit.  He greeted us warmly when we entered, came and chatted briefly with us while we were waiting for our food, and opened the door for us when we left.  The server was alright as well.  But, that's where the positives ended.  Granted, I am comparing things with a memory, but if this is indicative of current practices, things have definitely changed.  The oil and basalmic poured out with the appetizer bread that used to be served have been replaced by some oil and pepper.  The small loaf was cold and hard.  My shoes stuck to the floor around our table.  The restroom was dirty and in need of repair.  Gone was the music piped into the restaurant and the atmosphere that was created there in the past.  When the food arrived, I thought the chicken I ate was off for some reason.  After a couple of bites I realized what it was.  It tasted exactly like the chicken that is reconstituted after being frozen in a microwave dinner.  I didn't eat any more of it.  The pasta was well cooked, but the sauces were lacking.  To cap it off, a family member who has the chicken parmesan came home with a very upset stomach.  I still don't want to give up on RMG, with so many GOOD memories from the past.  But I'm left with the impression that I should leave my experiences with RMG at that, the good memories.  Disappointing to say the least.< /Review><user_name>Ron Dillender<//user_name>< resp>

Very crowded the night we went but the food was fabulous and our waiter went above and beyond the expected to make our dinner with my in-laws a lovely experience.   There was a slightly more quiet dining area in the bar area that would have been my preference, when available. The open kitchen was interesting to see, although a little noisy, but part of the experience. They dealt nicely with food allergies and during our order easily allowed us to switch out the offending food for a safe alternative. I usually eat half my dinners and take half home but the specialty pasta dish was so good, I missed having leftovers. The brussel sprouts were a game changer for holiday dinners. Seriously good food. My in-laws liked the wine offered and ended up buying the whole bottle to take home.<//Review>

<Review>Seating went fine. Server didn't introduce  himself, didn't ask what we wanted to drink. He came with water which was warm. Most of dinner, it was if we were an after thought. He seemed to be rushed and made us feel like we needed to eat and leave. Subsequent request for water was ignored. Food was ok, not like the Macaroni Grill we remembered. Between the not so great service and the not so great food...maybe this is why other locations have closed.</Review>< pictures>

The food here is typical chain restaurant food. Very salty and very oily. They do have an express menu that is relatively cheap, but you have to make sure to order it from the counter. The bread is delicious. There is not typically awake when I go there.</review>

<Text>Lovely place. Love the house bread. We keep visiting here often. Big shout out to Lance the manager of this restaurant.He was very warm and made sure we were comfortable.  On an earlier visit, I was told one of the dishes"Chicken under the brick" was out. I had left a comment on this at their website. Lance not only wrote back but gave me a free coupon to get my favorite dish on my next visit. Good service.< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_name>

The food was okay. The service was mediocre. I felt like the waiter (an older gentleman) was being condescending, merely tolerating us in his restaurant. I guess these folks fancy themselves a "gourmet Italian restaurant" rather than a cookie-cutter chain that just filed for Bankruptcy last year. This is just a step above Olive Garden, folks. Not bad, but not great, either.<//text>

Lunch pasta was ok, but very slow service, took almost an hour for food to arrive after order.  We had a large group so maybe the chefs were unprepared for a large order.   Somehow the restaurant seems more vacant than I remember from fee years ago.</review>

< Review>
Went after really long time. Food was good, especially the aribiatta resd sauce pasta and fettuccine alfredo.  Service was really bad. One of our pastas didnt come until everyone else was done with their dinner. The server was almost avoiding even looking at us or coming and checking on us or letting us know why the pasta was taking so long. They weren't that full at the time as we went at 6pm and half the restaurant was empty. So would recommend to go there only when time is not a constraint.< /Review>

<Time>1545062378382</Time><Review>Late post: We drove from Hayward on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Whst a mistake.  We stood at checkin desk for 15 minutes along with 8 other guest.  Finally the bartender came from back and appeared upset.  It took her 5+ minutes to move 2 chairs (only a few tables were occupied).

Eventually someone came to seat us.  Fast forward, my knife was dirty, never washed.  Second set of silver wear was dirty. As we prepared to eat bread, my granddaughter noticed a glob of cheese on bread plate.  I requested to speak with the manager.  She was non caring and offered another plate.  We declined and left, never to return.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

<text>Great food. Service was fantastic, and the prices not too bad for what you get. The only negative comment I have is that we sat right next to the bar where a football game was on, and the guys were cheering so loud that at times we couldn't here each other talk.< /text>< Pics>

We have been here before and we've had positive experiences
Today our food was good and we enjoy each other's company.
Our waiter didn't do a good job.
1. He never came to check if we needed something
2. Neve offered parmesan cheese
3. Brought the bill without offering dessert.
We have always had  good service before< /review>

<rating>5</rating><text>We went on friday night june 14th a most unfortunate thing happened which was out of the control of the staff. Apparently there was a power outage which covered the whole shopping complex the food was delivered. They were not allowing anyone else in they served all of the customers who ordered. Even though they had no control over the situation they continued to apologize eveyone accepted the outage only one table kept saying this is unacceptable they acted as though the crew killed the power but i guess when you feel you are unimportant and you act like you are above everyone else i guess that everything should cater to you the staff went above and beyond in light of the situation< /text>< pictures>

<Review>The service was very good and very fast. The food  varies from very good to barely passable. I had Osso boccu and was excellent. My date had the porterhouse steak, which burnt on the outside, medium rare on the inside, lots of gristle and fat. And the sauce they put on it was bland. It was the highest priced entree on the menu and a big dissapointment.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The service in the bay area is generally pretty poor but this place is a little above average by comparison. Luckily, the food is better than the service and it arrives lightning fast. I find it stunning how quick their kitchen is, even during the dinner rush.<//text>

Food was okay. We got stuck with a server who initially did not show up for almost 20 minutes and then was in a hurry to get us out of there. Luckily the gentleman at reception came by and initially hooked us work drinks and then took care of us at the end. I would advise them to focus on the service as the food is mediocre.<//review>

The food was very good, and the portions extremely generous; you'll definitely have leftovers, which makes the slightly high prices worth it. The waitstaff was pleasant and the service was fast - we got our salads about five minutes after we placed our orders, and the entrées arrived before I had even finished my salad. This place also serves fresh baked bread (focaccia) for the table, which was nice and hot. I ordered the classic truffle mac and cheese, which was a little bit spicy (comes with black pepper in it) and very cheesy, but a little drier than I was hoping it would be (I like my mac and cheese very creamy). Overall, this is a nice place that I would visit a few times a year because of the prices and how heavy the food is.</Text>

I went for the first time today (Christmas day). I am not sure what is the goal of this place-but they're struggling. The staff seemed overwhelmed, lost, the cooks were agruing in Spanish and yes I understood most words. The food was blan. I got a pizza and veggies. No flavor, service was full of errors. I should have went to Ihop.< /Text>

< Review>
EDIT (Jun/2018): This place is decaying fast. It appears their corporate overlords decided that they only want your money and don't care for your experience. On our last visit, we had to wait 40+ minutes to sit, even though the place was about 1/4 full. Empty tables everywhere and no servers to take customers. To me, this indicates a company that wants to keep costs low by employing fewer server than they need. After our wait, we were served by a very disinterested waiter. The free bread (one of the selling points of the place) is still there, but was clearly not fresh as it used to be. They now charge extra for salads and soup. In the end, we spent around 3h+ to have a very dissatisfying experience. I won't be coming back anytime soon. It's a real shame, since the place used to be a good place to eat casually.

OLD REVIEW:
Good "bang for the buck". It's not "authentic" Italian food, but the taste is good. Not super expensive and the setting is very nice for what you pay for. A nice loaf of bread is included as an appetizer when you order any entree.< /Review>

< Review>
I'm NEVER one to complain, but my experience here on 10/7/18 warrants it!!

It was an absolute disaster from the beginning. When we got first got there, we were told that there was approx. 25 min wait for a party of 4... no big thing...

After my personal observation, I noticed that there were several open tables where the recent parties just departed. These tables sat open for 15 mins or more, and then I realized that who ever did the scheduling did not have enough bussers available. I only saw a bus boy cleaning tables.  TALK ABOUT BEING GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED! C'MON MAN!

After inquiring with the host/manager after 35 mins, we were then seated. The table wasnt prepared, no utensil settings, no glasses... really?!? Being patient, I let it slide...

Waiter eventually came around and took our order after sitting arnd for 10 mins. Again, no utensil settings but we got our drinks... and bread...  but no utensils. I finally had to ask another waiter if we could get some settings...

We placed 3 orders of appetizers; calamari, mac n cheese bites, and fresh mozzarella. Calamari came w/in 10 mins of the initial order. We proceeded to order our main dishes.

Our main dish came in 35 mins w/in ordering it, but the other appetizers havent arrived yet and no explanation... wth?!  After working into our main dish, the remaining appetizers came 42 mins since placing it and 7 mins AFTER the main dish arrived.

After waiting all that time, we really didnt have any appetite to eat any more... would you or any one??? C'MON MAN!

Where is John Taffer when you need him? Good grief, talk about a bootleg operation! C'MON MAN!

If you have time to burn and really dont care about the quality of service, then this is your place. Sadly, for the price that they demand, you're better off cooking the meal yourself without the unwanted stress!!

In my personal observation, this place lacks:
* communication
* integrity
* compassion
* desire

Sadly, we were among 5 other parties who were waiting for service in this bootleg operation. John Taffer would scream out, "you're in the customer service business and your livelihood depends on it!! Are you f$&n crazy?!?"

Needless to say, our party left extremely disappointed. If I was a representative from this corporation and experienced what I went through, there would be a lot of unemployed people with the fear of this place shutting down..

This place is broken and needs help! Sorry to be brutally honest, but I'm pulling for you guys to stay in business...<//Review>

<rating>2<//rating><review>I came for lunch as a small company event for 5 people and the service was sub par.  We were seated promptly on a busy afternoon lunch. The things I want to highlight are that we did not have bread offered to our table.  I ended up requesting the bread which did not arrive until after our appetizers were eaten.  Another issue was that once the bread arrived, our table did not have the black oil condoment. Another issue is that our waitor was reaching across peoples faces while delivering and retrieving plates.  Lastly, I ordered medium cooked lamb chops and two of the three peices of meet were good. Unfortunately the third piece was burned on one side.  The meat was so charred when I bit into it, it tasted like coal.

Asthetically, the area looked over crowded and simply not the best.  The environment may need reevaluation.  On this note, I was not impressed by a paper cover over the table mantles.

I can safely say that this site is understaffed.  We were waited on by 4 different waiters.  I can chalk up the reaching for plates across people as rushing through the task. As for the  burnt food, it's not easy to serve so many at a busy time.  Or maybe training is required for waiters and cooks to emphasize quality of service.

All of this is unfortunate but I wanted to give pinpointed feedback to the site.<//review>< Pics>

Since I don't like crowds, we decided to try this out on a Thursday evening. The initial bread was delicious, the Caesar salad crisp and the grilled salmon melted in my mouth. Service was good.< /Review>

Being a chain, the food is predictable and consistently good enough. Service can run slow and be hard to track down, but are generally friendly.</Text>

This place has really gone backwards in the last year or so. We were there Sunday night. The restaurant was half empty and we still have to wait 30 mins. The staff told us they were shorthanded. I am not sure how that happens on a weekend. Our waitress then forgot about our bread, and they didn't have 2 out of the 4 entre items that we ordered. Again, I don't know how that happens in such a seasoned restaurant on a weekend. These items are meatball & shrimp of all things. They also brought out the appetitizer and entrees all at the same time on a small table with 4 people. This will be the last time that I will be there.<//Text>

It's a good italian restaurant.  The taste is in synch with what I have found in Italy.
The card offers a wide range of choice.
My cappelini with shrimp was fine. The glass of Chianti was on a good standard as well.
I also appreciate the appetizer based on olive oil bread: typical italian.<//Review>

Food is OK.   Subpart to other Mac grill.  Pasta was not cooked enough and we're stuck together.  Pasta not recommended.  Steak is good, though.<//text>

I love the restaurant and been going here for 10 years, but the way the person at the take out counter treated me today, was just ridiculous.
1. He picked up my online order from trash.
2. He said it will take few mins for order to be ready even when it was already 30 mins since I had ordered online.
3. While I was waiting, I could see the to-go boxes lying on counter but he still said my order is not ready and that I had to wait few mins more.

After 20 mins waiting at the restaurant he finally picked up the to-go boxes and put them into bag, went in to get the juice and then gave me the bag with the cold food inside.

I reported the same to the manager in the restaurant and she said that she can help refund me the money, but that's not the point I told her and asked her to follow up with the employee.

What I don't understand is what do these working people get by treating the restaurant's customer in such bad way and ruin restaurant's reputation.< /review>

<review>We had Brunch today and have always loved it but today it was not good.  My husband and I ordered Chicken Parm. eggs benedict because we've had it several times and love it.  Not today....no love.  Chicken was kind of burnt on the bottom and hard to cut and the cheese topping was slightly burnt.  Potatoes- which I love were not very hot and not loved either.  Our friends did not say much since we had raved about brunch there but I knew they weren't happy.  It was all in all very disappointing.  Last Saturday we had a delish dinner and are planning on catering our anniversary party next month with Macaroni Grill. I hope this was just a fluke today :((<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Get Italian Tapas for $9 - that is the best value.
In my case, the waiter was very courteous; however took a long time to get the check and the card back.<//text>

1.We walked in and instantly where given a table for 7. 2. They did make a mistake about what food to bring to someone at the table but handled it well and gave them the food on  the house and a free desert. Over all they had grate service and food.< /Review>

<Review>I usually like this place for taste and service as well! The ambience is great, quick lunch menu is nice option on working day.. the bar has some good collection! But there are specific items which one should try and should not even think about it.. the one that never disappoints is Pollo Caprese! This is all time favorite..pasta Milano (which is removed from menu but can be made on request) is good when you’ve large appetite! Seafood is bit risky.. it’s not fresh & lobster ravioli is a big NO!   Kids will love Margarita pizza and so is their spicy sauce - arabiata! It’s much better than regular marinara!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fc8df6b0d67af:0x9d419fde15e00c1f< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>Went there for the first time yesterday for Thanksgiving with my niece. We ordered the lobster ravioli, meatballs, Plus the calamari. Now this is the first time I've been to the Milpitas restaurants I normally go to the El Cerrito restaurant. The lobster ravioli was a little flat from me. They didn't put enough cheese on my ravioli I'm used to the server coming to the table with the cheese grater asking if we needed more cheese on top of our ravioli. Not enough Lobster claw inside the ravioli. Too many tomatoes. it could have been a little fuller with lobster claw.   like they do in El Cerrito. But my niece's ordered a glass of champagne, Now I'm not a champagne drinking kind of person but this campaign that she ordered looked good, and refreshing. So I decided to order me a glass also.WOW!!! That was some good ass champagne. I really don't care for champagne but this campaign was really good not too dry and a very nice aftertaste. I forgot the name of the champagne. I'm going to call my niece and have her give me the name of that champagne I might just end up getting a bottle of this champagne for myself.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>My second trip here for the mushroom ravioli, it's really good, even i am not a vegan, i really love it. The Caesar side salad was great with croutons. Love the croutons.
For antipasta, i had calamari fritti, it's just okay, not impressive. Their house bread is the worst, tasteless and hard, red lobster and texas roadhouse have way better house bread.
I had penne rustica this round, it's very flavorful, lot of shrimps, bacon and roasted chicken, like the slightly burnt cheese in top, but too salty, that's why i just gave four stars.<//text>< Name>

Consumer Picks 2016 #1 Italian Restaurant. Always abuzz with life and chatter. There is energy in this place as soon as you enter. Get the fresh bread on the table and the crayons for the kids and you are set to get started on the meal. Portions are hearty and service is quick and snappy. Lots of vegetarian options. Child friendly and child sound proof :) Must try dishes: Goat cheese peppadew peppers, portobello fries, Butternut Asiago Tortellaci.</text>
