<Review>Very clean, polite, and a welcoming environment. The workers really take your comfort and pleasure into consideration, and make you feel at home. I always request Andrew, as he is a great conversationalist, funny, takes his time, and does a stellar job. 10/10 would recommend. Every nail tech there is lovely and puts in 100% in their work.<//Review>< gmapID>

This place is very clean, very friendly and welcoming. Every nail tech working there is extremely caring and takes in consideration your comfort level. Each time I go, I have Andrew as my nail tech and he is very polite, a great conversationalist, funny, and does a great job on my nails. I am never disappointed, and the prices are great. 10/10 would recommend</text>

All nail technicians are very respectful and friendly and the shop is clean and well kept. I personally request the services of Foscoe who is very skilled in the details and artwork that he performs on me. I recommend this shop to anybody who wants a good nail experience and in a clean and relaxing environment.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1621620389822, 'text': 'Thank you Cathy.'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Professional, clean, and friendly! I found this place on Instagram and always request for Holly! I ask for unique and trendy full set designs and she always “nails it” (pun intended 😜) she’s very careful about her craft, very passionate about her work and super talented! She’s gentle too which is rare to find! (those who get acrylic nails will understand and appreciate). They stay fairly true to their appointments! I’ve been on time and never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes. I’d definitely recommend going early and during the week days to avoid potential waiting as it can get busy - especially if you don’t have an appointment!</review>

I always get gel manicure here and it lasts 2-3 weeks average. One time it lasted 2 months and another time it chipped off on the third day. But I love the service and collection.</review>

<Review>The service here was good but the quality of nail paint they used was really bad. I got basic manicure and pedicure and the paint from my nails started chipping within 3 days. Will not go back to this place again.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQc05odediFappoSX7At-TY8JhqRp80cWG67KS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOn_upQoHKgJlTGyoJFYkFsbT7hmCJEREaRiw5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcb5147bae61f:0x441ffaea14a43e00</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>4<//rating><text>I really like this place. It's a hidden gem. I usually go to Queenies Nail Spa but lately every time I try to make an appointment they are completely booked out. Anyway I was looking at Nail salons on yelp and found this one.

I was skeptical initially when I called in, but when I went in  the owner of the spa greeted me and I was helped right away. I got the dipping powder - ombré and also got a pedicure. I had one aesthetician who helped me with all my services.

I really liked the dip service and will definitely go back. This is my new favorite place. Hope this one doesn't get too crowded and hard to find appointments<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I very much appreciated that my nails were done by a second tech at the same time my pedicure was done as this saved time.  But I did not feel rushed- I was encouraged to relax.  Both technicians were meticulous and did a fantastic job!  I will definitely come here again the next time I'm in town.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>I was the wedding Dj at this venue a few weeks ago. Beautiful place. It was a little chilly, but the patio cover they had was great to keep the heat in. The garden is really nice to walk through. For vendors, moving in and out was really easy and everything was close by. I only did reception though. The ceremony area is a little bit of a walk.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_v6WJsOqNQSvZyDM3LcbVFeG-3xh65F3GeGYK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOt_-06zRxIdXSwcKZFXlnAIdR-XVaFaYW4JaA0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5m6jdc80JHENABACsXx4ulhfK2U60dfpUOIu0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0pTGvhJtCGMkyrojic8_ch-HahTQWmxBFhAz-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOE1BTXWEsVbzbG53P2nvAVnQgd5piC_cR2mwZo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_n1V3QLvOZ9-ERKIH6VOZqFvtNAaiABl2Snpo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< rating>

This is such a fantastic place!!!
The most beautiful gardens and setting you'll ever find. Perfect for all occasions but especially weddings and receptions.
Can't think of a better place to go anywhere in the area for even outside of the county.<//Review>

<Text>Really lovely venue. Went here for a wedding. The birds and especially the peacocks were beautiful. Everything was perfect and exactly the way my friends (the couple) wanted everything to be. The food was decent, but mainly I loved the setting. The peacocks were a bit loud during the ceremony, but it really didn't detract from the whole event. It kind of gave that slice of paradise feel.< /Text><user_name>Sadie Meyers</user_name><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

As a Moorpark wedding photographer (Lovisa Photo), I frequently work with many beautiful wedding venues, but Eden Gardens stands out from the rest. This wedding venue is perfect for anyone looking for an outdoor venue. The property has so many beautiful spots to photograph couples on their wedding day, and when the golden rays peek through the trees at sunset it makes for the most stunning wedding photos. If you are looking for a lush outdoor garden venue, you must check out Eden Gardens< /review>

My son was so excited and entertained by Spider man! He did a great job!My son turned 4 on Sunday and we threw him a Spider man themed party and when he arrived he would not leave his site.He wanted to learn all of Spider's moves and Spider man sure did teach him quite a few, I took so many photos and videos of this and everyone at the party said this was the best Spider man ever!Thank you so much! I would definitely recommend your company to my friends and family members for their next themed party!<//text>

Great venue! Everything is quite spread out, so if you hire a DJ for an event here then make sure he has enough sound systems for each location (ceremony, cocktail, dinner, dancing). Whenever I deejay at this venue I make that very clear to my clients.< /Text>

< review>
Having been part of a wedding (groomsman), the venue isn't too bad, the staff, however, are horrible. Lacking people skills, and no common sense. When you leave props for some of the wedding events, you'd expect them to be left alone. Nope. Tossed out. Then, when you had staff come and actually take some props away from your table, and berate you for them (a bottle of alcohol that was sealed), it's even worse.

Sure,  you want to make your cut from the open bar, but, when you're giving bottles as gifts, or using them, LEAVE THEM ALONE. No one's going to cut into your precious bar revenue.<//review>

Co2 tank refills are $11, which is a good deal. Great location, right on twin oaks. Check them out if you have any growing needs, as well as their website for any nutrients. They have them at bottom dollar.< /Review>< rating>

<Review>This place is great. They hooked me up with everything I needed for an entry level DWC grow for less than I could find the stuff online for.

Also handled the Covid situation well with a curbside pickup at the back of the store. I called and my order was picked and ready within 10 minutes.<//Review>< rating>

Those dudes in there know there stuff! They are very welcoming to all levels of growers.

As a black grower it’s nice to go into a hydro store and not get followed around and scoffed at and offered the cheapest product.

SAVE THIS ADDRESS! Don’t wanna lose track of this place by far the best in North County SD!

Owner even gave me free emerald nutes with purchase of lamp and bulbs to get started since I couldn’t get it all plus the fox farm kit I wanted to run.<//text>

Mark n his helpful hydro genius's are always ready to assisted with any garden questions I ask. Prices unheard of! Always matching or going lower then other local shops who claim they have the best pricing in my area. Hands down this is my spot. N I wanted too let cyber world know, you should stop by n check out there stock. Place is fully loaded. N the turtles r really cool just to watch.

You guys rock =.)</text>

Best hydro shop ever!! Unlike so many other shops I've been too, SD Hydro has working hydroponic systems filled with plants. They greet you when you walk in, like they want your business. There's not a question Mark and the boys cant answer. The prices are amazing as well.
Stop by on Wednesdays and Saturdays for free compost tea.<//review>

The guy told me maybe they put the ph down in the ph up bottle and I told him it wasn't true he tried after 8 times... finally says you know what I'll give you your return back he didn't believe what I was telling him was true so done buy and hydroponic brand products of theirs<//Review>< pics>

You never wait and they even help load up your car for you!  Prices can't be beat. If you're shopping at a different garden center, you're not doing it right. Thanks to the Marc and the two Zacks and Ryan and everyone else for all the wisdom and guidance!</review>< Gmap_id>

So I went here a total beginner with only a few days of knowledge on growing anything and Danny really helped me understand the whole process of hydroponics and the customer service there was just exceptional. Highly recommend going to this store.</Text>

What an awesome experience and first time. Both Zach and Mark were super helpful. I purchased a pH meter and Mark insisted he calibrated it for me.
I would recommend this place just for their customer service.</Review>

Ordered three 120* spectrum king lights from Mark. Mark sent me home with 90* lights, didn't know it till I got ready to use them. Mark cussed me up and down and won't even swap them out. See you in court.<//text>

<text>This is a nostalgic ride thru history. Directly across from the Grand Central Market you take this journey up a small hill in turn of the century funicular cars. Outstanding ride if only for a brief moment. The views at the top are of modern glass and steel buildings. Quite a contrast indeed.</text>< pics>

The most fun you will have for 1 dollar. It's very good this funicular is preserved and even functioning perfectly.<//review>

<review>Angels Flight is a great stop in a beautiful part of LA. How often can you ride a funicular? Not to mention the fictional crime scene of a Michael Connelly book, and a scene location from "La La Land"? Don't miss Grand Central Market across the street at the bottom.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN72CXtro5A7u3GDFOzXkoQ5bqPjkHlBVdknXmj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

Worth the 1 dollar to ride it up and another dollar to ride it down. Beats taking the stair way which stinks. Fun to ride. You have to do it if your visiting in the area.< /Review>

<Review>Who knew that L.A. has a funicular - right?! When I found out about it, I had to see it for myself. The ride up literally takes about one minute, and once at the top, there's nothing particularly spectacular to see except for close up views of some of the city's skyscrapers. Still, a visit to Angel's Flight is worth it for the uniqueness factor.< /Review>< name>

<rate>4< /rate><text>I just love it here. Nostalgia at its finest! Where in LA can you ride a cable car? And only 50 cents each way; 25 cents if you have a metro pass. It goes from Hill St to Grand Ave - saves you that walk through urine stairways. PU!

Come and ride the short tour - it keeps Angels Flight in business and something that you can't really do in LA and you'll come see LA - the watercourt area, MOCA, Disney Hall, Grand Park, etc.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Although closed, the funicular railway, and the train that sits on the track, are still there, making great photo opps. In addition, historical placards provide great information on what was once a fully operational funicular. The stairs next to the tracks are still open to the public, but are in a poor state, littered with trash and the overwhelming smell of human waste.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Slope railway
The design feels like a cable car
Keep the feeling of the old train box
Take a trip back and forth for one dollar
The scenery on the top is not bad.
Can look a little like Los Angeles
Suitable for a look at it once
Lalaland has taken pictures here.
It should be a new point because the movie is red.

(Original)
一段斜坡鐵路
設計感像是纜車一樣
保留老舊的火車包廂的感覺
搭乘一趟來回一美元
上頭風景還不錯
可以稍微俯瞰洛杉磯的樣貌
適合來體驗一次看看
Lalaland有在這邊拍過戲
應該是因為電影才紅起來的新點< /Text>

(Translated by Google) A one-way trip costs US $ 1, a very short drive. After taking the car, I took a picture of me, and even got to the seat to get off. The retro style of the carriage is very good, you can choose to ride from bottom to top (pay when you are out of the station) or ride from top to bottom (pay when you are at the station). Because it is not expensive, it can be regarded as a scenic spot that can take pictures and ride. Although the ride is short, the route is steep and it is recommended to sit safely.

(Original)
搭乘一趟(one way)需美金一元，非常短的車程，乘車後顧著拍照的我，甚至來不及坐到座位上就到達需下車了。車廂復古造型很不錯，你可以選擇由下往上搭(出站時付款)或由上往下搭(入站時付款)都可以。因為也不貴，算是一個可以拍照又搭車的景點。雖然車程很短，但路線很陡，還是建議坐著比較安全。</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) A nice way to go up or down the food market to Down Town.
Kids will love the ride (pretty short).

It should be noted that it is very difficult to mount wagons, so it is advisable to fold them before lifting.

The fare is one or half dollars if you have a Metro ticket.

דרך נחמד לעלות או לרדת משוק האוכל לדאון טאון.
ילדים מאוד יאהבו את הנסיעה (הדי קצרה).

יש לשים לב שקשה מאוד לעלות עגלות, אז מומלץ לקפל אותם לפני העליה.

מחיר הנסיעה הוא דולר אחד או חצי דולר אם יש לך כרטיס של המטרו.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>This salon and their staff are amazing. I had the pleasure of working with Christy for a long overdue haircut. She was very sweet and skilled. I usually avoid salons because I've not had very many good experiences but she went above and beyond to make sure I got the cut and style I was looking for. She was amazing enough to give me good advice and suggestions for my hair type plus how to care for the style afterwards. I've never worked with a stylist who put so much care into their work. I highly recommend giving this salon a try! I definitely will be returning. Thank you guys!<//Review>< name>

<text>Limón Salon has a great vibe and always feels so welcoming.  The salon is always pristine and during this pandemic that hasn't changed.  I felt safe and all precautions were taking for mine and the staff's health.  All the stylists do incredible work! I've been seeing Phat for 2 years now and he does an incredible job with my hair everytime I see him. I can't recommend them enough!!<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgB-HxHBMj5bjUWffg2Pj6T5E0jgBp7f8Kne_N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

<Text>The shop was recommended to me by my roommate. My hair seemed so dry and decided I wanted a wash and blowout. I ended up having some waxing and getting a special conditioning treatment. Everyone in the shop is helpful and entertaining and knew their business. I will go back again soon and recommend them to others!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Ask for Amanda! She has been my go-to stylist for the last few years now and she amazes me each time. She keeps her hair craft innovative and is always on top of the new trends as she attends many stylist seminars. She does a wonderful job cutting hair any style- I've had layers and bangs from her. She also does a great job with color, high-lights and low-lights. She also does a great job styling hair. I trust her tips and admire her hard-working ethics too. Book with her now!!< /review><Resp>None< /Resp>< rating>

Great service, Hank is great too. Obviously not the place for you if you're on a tight budget. But I'm having my wedding soon, so it's a small price to pay to ensure I have the look I want. Worth every dollar.<//text>

This place is full of beauty and style. Lovely staff and great service. They know what's good for your hair. I go to Amanda and she is a star!
It is on a little expensive side but you and your hair deserve a good pamper once every 2-3 months.
I love their decor and it doesn't feel musty or dark like many other bay area salons, it has a fresh feel to it.<//text>

I love it here! I just moved to the area and was looking for a new salon and I'm so glad I found Limon. I went in to get my haircut in preparation for my wedding and Crystal was sure to give me updates every step of the way to make sure I was satisfied.

Another great experience at Limon Salon. I attempted many times to get back to my natural color on my own. I got further and further from a normal color with my skin tone. My hair looked damaged, dull, and my roots were way lighter than the rest of my hair.

Andrea did a consultation with me and explained in great detail of what I was doing wrong and what would work for me to get back on the track of healthy flattering hair. I can't believe she achieved it all the next day.

She got me to a perfect color, gave me a treatment to make it healthier, and a perfect haircut. Andrea is professional, knowledgeable & friendly. The stylists at Limon Salon always give off a kind easy going vibe. They make you feel welcome.<//text>

<Review>I went here for the first time a few months ago and had a stylist randomly assigned to me, Anthony. He asked me a lot of questions, was very gentle with my extremely thick and difficult hair, and gave me an amazing haircut - better than I've been given in a long, long time. Most people trim way too much, and I always leave feeling frustrated. Anthony was careful to trim the really bad parts but maintain the length. I will definitely be going back!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Phat did an amazing job! I needed a corrective cut after visiting a different salon and Limon was able to get me in on (relatively) short notice. So lucky to have found Phat - he took time to understand what I wanted, explained all the products (but never made me feel obligated to buy anything), and showed me how to recreate his styling techniques at home. Most of all though, he was thorough! There wasn't a hair on my head he didn't meticulously trim and artfully style. So happy with my experience!< /text>

I have given this salon 2 chances. First time 1 year ago I got a haircut which was a disaster: "Rachel from Friends in the 90's". Totally ruined my bob cut with unnecessary layers. Second time was January 2017, asked for ashy blond highlights and got this dark and brassy color. My original base was also ruined. I don't recommend this salon for blonds or trendy short haircuts. Service was polite but It doesn't replace bad quality.</text>

Been going to this amazing salon for many years. They are experts in the field and treat you wonderfully. Their customer service is spot on. The stylists/colorists always listen and are very attentive to your hair and preferences. It's worth every penny!!! Definitely the best salon in San Jose area. :-)</Review>

<text>Victor is a STAR. I was nervous about getting a bob so asked a lot of questions as my hair was cut, but Victor was sweet the whole time and made sure I was comfortable with his process. He gave me the best haircut I have had in a really long time! I live in NYC now and wish I could go back to him every time!
Used google $50 for $75 deal- total with tip was $65.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I went here twice, the first for a consultation on my hair and then the actual Brazilian Blowout (my stylist was Taylor). This was the first time I was getting a Brazilian Blowout and walked in with the expectation of having frizz-free hair. However, 3 days after my service, the frizz was back.

At this point, I emailed the salon explaining the issue, but there was no response. I then contacted my stylist who proceeded to inform me (for the first time) that Brazilian Blowout only gets rid of 60% frizz. Instead of fixing the issue, she asked me to come in for a followup Keratin Express
service (a paid service btw).

The stylist was extremely unprofessional and brushed off the incident, saying things like "I'm also learning right now" and "I've asked a few other stylists about the intended effects of Brazilian Blowout and it's only 60% frizz reduction". The staff proceeded to ignore me and left me to directly deal with the stylist, refusing to intervene.

The stylist also (again, for the first time) mentioned that just the treatment would not help and I'd have to buy a long laundry list of products to keep the hair smooth and frizz free.

Considering that this was a ~500$ service and the first time I was getting a Brazilian Blowout, I was expecting information and guidance, both of which were lacking in the 5 hours in total I spent at the salon. If I was told that the service would not get rid of the frizz, I would've gotten my hair straightened for a fraction of the price instead.< /Review>< Time>

Ursula did a stellar coloring job on my hair. Just moved to the area, and very grateful to have found "the best." I do not hesitate to recommend her to be able to figure out what would look best for a person. She is a real artist.< /text>

<text>Went here for a haircut because it seemed stylish. Janet made me wait nearly an hour for an past my appointment time to start, then she seemed rushed to end day. It was one of the worst haircuts I’ve ever had. There were pieces that were uncut sticking out that I had to trim at home. Had to get it recut a week later. Worst $86 spent - total disappointment.< /text>< Time>

<review>Scout did my hair and i love it.  She took to time to listen to me and actually did what I asked for, which I love. They also use good hair product so my hair looked great and felt great when I left.  It's a nice clean bright environment and they offered me a limosa (they're very own specialty) which is a nice touch. Changing hair dressers is always a hard...I recently moved to the area and feel so lucky to have found a place I want to go back to.<//review><userid>103033837113061829060<//userid><Time>1359497825471< /Time><gmapID>0x808fcae602b76903:0xb21c12d898404633<//gmapID><username>Olivia McClellan< /username><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>My daughter used their services for a blond baby highlights last Tuesday with Briana, after 5 hours,,, my 17 year old Daughter looked exactly the same,, actually a bit darker than before.. I tried to speak with the manager and he Is not calling me back and its nothing they said they can do about it.

My daughter was upset and crying, she was exciting to get a new hair look before school starts,, but she got disappointed big time plus she had to pay 250.00 dollars for nothing..

I WONT RECOMMEND THIS SALON,, the levels of experience stylist they described does not work, its all about money...,, the more experience,,, the more money..... expensive... but they should be doing a better job,,,, and better Customer Service Experience for new clients.....

<Text>I was looking for a new hairdresser, since mine moved out of state. After looking at all the excellent reviews on yelp, I called and made an appointment (don't want to name the hairdresser's name). I got there a bit early for my appointment, there was nobody at the reception desk, but I saw a few hairdressers at their stations. I was happy to see that they carry Oribe products, so I walked around looking at these products and making a list of what to buy. I noticed that I spent about 10 minutes in the reception area, nobody said hello to me, nobody bothered to ask with whom my appointment was - nothing! I was just flat out being ignored and totally left to myself! Needless to say, I really didn't feel welcome or appreciated as  a customer. So, I walked out! Sorry to say that, but that was my experience!!!< /Text>< pictures>

Weekly bleachings, dime store hair cuts, 450 degree straighteners... The Spanish Inquisition's got nothing on how badly I tortured my hair. I abused it to death. No, really - the entire back was fried to straw. But i called this morning, nearly in tears and at my wits end after a bad " Super cuts" experience, and they got me in just after lunch.

So, i get there. Funky atmosphere, and original artwork on the walls. Girl at the desk is cheerful with a modern style. Exactly what you want to see going into a place like this. She offers me a beverage, all top shelf options. Such a relaxing beginning.

Then comes my stylist. Shes also quite friendly. We go through my hair and its agreed, this is a god awful mess (she was far more respectful in her phrasing but im sure she was thinking it :P ) so we talk a bit, i show some photos (always take photos with you, girls. It helps a lot!) And she sighs. Ooooooh no. Oh god. Ive been trying so hard to grow it out. Do we have to? She proceeds to gently explain what she feels is the best course of action. Ive known some doctors who could take a lesson from her about bedside manner.  I ended up agreeing to a chin length bob cut. Goodbye, shoulder length hair. I'll miss feeling you on my shoulders but this is for the best.

She was careful but not ridiculously slow. It took awhile but i think that's because she had to find a happy medium between getting all the fried hair out and not giving me a pixie cut.
An hour after i sat down, i finally got to put my glasses back on. I was stunned at how cute my hair was. The color looked real again, and the straw was all gone! At money time, she showed me the products she recommended, shook my hand, then went back to her station before i even got my card out. This is a HUGE thing for me. When a stylist hangs around, i have a hard time not feeling insanely pressured to buy the recommended products. Even if i have the same thing at home already. I found her behavior very respectful.

Walking down the street, the wind tried to screw it up, but it just couldnt.  Total Pocahontas a la disney. Stuff just kept falling right back into perfect place when the wind died down.

Its expensive. With tip, I paid 100 even. But its also typical cost for the area, and you're getting way above typical service.< /Text>

<resp>{'time': 1579894778488, 'text': 'Hi Deej,\nIt was nice talking to you last week. Thank you for coming back in to consult with Taylor and for the kind compliments about her and your haircut. Taylor explained to you during your original appointment on 11/16/19, that because you had previous permanent black color in your hair that she would try to get you as light as possible depending on how your hair reacts to lightener. Taylor was able to get you as light as possible at your first session. She also explained, that to get to your goal color it would take multiple sessions, which you in turn booked with her a Dimensional Blonde service appointment for 4/25/20. We are very sorry to hear you are still upset about not receiving a partial refund on the original service, but we do not offer any refunds for services. Thank you for the review as we value all client feedback. Below I have attached more accurate before and after photos of your first session with Taylor.\nBest regards,\nCarlos\n\nBefore:\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/D4QU2YJ5fFsFYaBh8\n\nAfter:\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/pTYX27mJY8mxtERE6'}< /resp><gmapID>0x808fcae602b76903:0xb21c12d898404633<//gmapID></record>

Great place. The people there are very nice, and the environment is awesome. Although some songs I don’t even know what it means, but my friends love them. I guess that’s cool enough.< /Review>

Went to this place right after its grand opening. Great services. You can find all the songs you want with top notch equipments. Love the vibe and design there. We were surprised to see the variety of food and drinks they carry there. It will be our favorite new spot! Finally a decent karaoke and lounge in El Monte!!</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The first time I visited this newly opened KTV with a friend, I couldn't help but send a comment to call Live Pro! The environment is great, the music library is super full, the sound effects are superb, the boss is super kind and enthusiastic, the only regret is that I did not eat the authentic Inner Mongolia BBQ

(Translated by Google) It's really great. I haven't met such a comfortable Chinese bar / KTV in the United States for so many years. It's worth a try. Eat, drink and have fun. Never worry about having no place to go after dinner at night!

真的很棒 来美国这么多年没有遇见过这么舒服的华人酒吧/KTV 值得一试 有吃有喝有得玩 再也不用担心晚上吃完饭没地方去了！</Text>

<review>Nice little establishment, a reasonable amount of food on their menu you, attentive staff, but not too attentive. The takoyaki [first photo] was pretty decent, it had real chunks of octopus, and the fantasy roll was okay at best, it needed eel sauce to take it up a notch. I’m rating this a five stars because while the food wasn’t anything to rave about, it was quiet even with a lot of people and the staff did their job well and service was lightning fast.</review>< pics>

Good Raman here. Fresh, good flavor and not too salty. Sushi is ok as a side dish. Customer service is good. The vibe is good. Portion sizes are good as well.< /Review>

I ordered sushi for my first taste of this restaurant and I am very impressed! The rolls were beautifully presented and tasted fresh and yummy. As for the services, my waitress was very attentive and kind. I will definitely be returning soon! Thankyou for the great experience :)< /review>

I ordered a plate that came with 3 rolls avocado was good.Maybe their Special and Chef rolls are better?

The sushi was just good, but the ramen was great! The calamari tempura was bomb too. I like how they let you pick how spicy you want your ramen. The service was excellent. If they start getting to popular their gonna have trouble cuz its a tiny place. Its next door to THE HABIT. Check it out! This is the menifee roll, the tempura shrimp roll and salmon maki.</review>

<text>Staff was a 4 but the ramen was a 2 so I gave them 3 stars. I went for lunch and got the Katsu Curry Ramen. The broth was like an Indian or Thai curry (green) not Japanese curry. The Gyoza came before the ramen. Maybe it was supposed to be like an appetizer? But it wasn’t near being hot.
I’m sorry but being Japanese, I kind of have higher standards for ramen. The noodles were not ramen noodles; thick like lo mein noodles. It feels and tastes like a China Brothers annex. Don’t get me wrong, I love China Bros but if you’re expecting Japanese ramen, you may want to try Jake’s Rockin’ Ramen in Temecula.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I was skeptical going in after some bad ramen experiences, but this place delivered. I ordered it to go, drove home (~20 min) and put the baby to sleep (~20-30 min) before I ate it. It was STILL amazing. I can’t even imagine how amazing it would be freshly served. We are very picky about our ramen & really enjoyed it. We will definitely be back.< /text>

We were very excited to have a sushi/ramen spot in our neighborhood and we wanted to like it so that we would have a go-to spot in town. We ordered over $100 dollars worth of food because we wanted to try everything, we got there around 6pm and tried to order a dinner bento box and the lady taking our order told us it isn’t dinner time, I was confused and asked her what time they do dinner then and she said right now but it’s actually due to the fact that they ran out of the items. That’s fine but they communicated in a odd way, then my sister tried to order a sushi roll and in the menu it stated that it had avocado in it and my sister asked for it to be put on the side , the owner I’m assuming came by and argued with my sister saying it doesn’t come with avocado and she will charge us extra. This became a huge deal and by the end of it my sister showed them their own menu and pointed at the avocado listed, they didn’t apologize and gave us a dirty look instead. When we were done ordering they did not give me an order number when I asked so when they called out my number I didn’t know it was me and they looked at me like “hello this is yours” in a rude way again. We had so much food and when I asked for napkins and utensils they did not want to give it and I then had to say that we need it because we will be sharing food and eating outside. We also ordered ramen and they did not give us a spoon. Needless to say, we will not be returning. The food was not bad but it was definitely not worth the service we received.<//text>< Pics>

Got the spicy miso ramen and the dragon roll. We ordered to go and as soon as it was ready we ate in the car. The ramen was ok. Noodles were chewy and broth was very basic and honestly not very flavorful. The dragon roll was fine on taste but very small for the price. The staff was nice, but they are definitely in need of more people. Might come back to taste the fried rice but other than that we will stick to our usual spots.<//Text>

Ramen broth lacks taste and is a bit watery. Noodles were also overcooked and sticking together. Sushi was fresh though. Boba is also good.<//Text>

Bad service and bad food. I was excited to try this place when it opened because I love ramen and sushi but the food was terrible. Worst service too. Never going back.< /Review>

The ramen and Takoyaki were delicious. The portions for the ramen was perfect! My family liked the Crazy Tuna Roll, everything on it was fresh. I'll definitely be coming back to try their udon and other rolls.

Also if you order ramen for pickup they separate the broth from the noodles and toppings so it doesn't get gross and soggy.

My only complaint is that it gets crowded easily since it's a small restaurant. If you don't like crowded places like me then you'll want to eat here on the weekdays or order to go.< /Text>< pics>

Eye brow lamination was not good nor professionally done, I could tell the products were good but they did not put my brows high and now even when I try to brush them up they lay down because they didn’t do it right. eyebrow cleaning was good but lamination was a NO. During the process they didn’t put my brows up so now I have to wait for it to go away so I could use gel on it again!! Would not recommend.</review>

My Perfect Brows amazes me every time. I also highly recommend the facials :) Thanks again My Perfect Brows for making me feel beautiful than ever.

Came here for my first ever brow lamination and eyelash lift and let me just say, I am AMAZED. Aysha serviced me for both and she is beyond talented, I understand why she is rated #1 at My Perfect Brows. My experience here was great. As well as the service itself, the staff was very friendly and the location is clean. I will definitely be coming back here when it's time to touch up!

If you're in the Orange County area, I highly recommend you stop by and beautify yourself. You will not regret it!<//Text>

I haven't had a bad experience here yet the ladies all seem to know what they're doing, a little bit more expensive than other spots but consistent. Clean and quick. They squeezed me in one time ten minutes till closing so that was nice.</text>

I tried the lamination and brow tinting.  I’m very fair skinned and fair haired.  They made my brows look like movie star brows!! I actually didn’t know my eyebrows could ever be thick without tons of makeup but they worked a miracle!  Wow, highly recommended!<//text>

Today was my first time here and also my first time threading my eyebrows. Maryam did a great job. I was scared because I’m a guy and I didn’t want arched or shaped eyebrows, just clean. Maryam was good at her job and thankfully my eyebrows still look masculine. I recommend this place for men.<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>This place genuinely cares about your brows. They won’t thread more than needed and they will explain to you why. I was given very useful advice by Arti and I definitely plan on coming back.

I was truly impressed and this was my first time.
They could charge $15 and I would still gladly pay. Their prices are extremely generous for the quality and the service provided</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

The BEST place get your eyebrows done! The studio is clean but sometimes gets really busy. :(

Farzana is the best!! I have been getting brow and lip threading with her for 8 years now. She takes time on your brows to really clean and shape them!< /review>

Have been going to this shop for several years.  Have always had a positive experience. Even when the shop is full of customers,  the wait is rarely long.  They are true to their name!  I've ALWAYS left with,  "perfect brows".</Review>

My brows turned out okay - she seemed rush. I don’t like when you’re in and out of there within 5 minutes. Just felt like there was no care put into it and that showed in the quality of her work. I was also made to feel guilty for not having cash for a tip (I never carry cash because it’s not convenient to get). She went as far as to say, “we won’t get the tip until the end of the month so can you bring cash?” I’m sorry, but teachers have to wait a month to get paid, why should it be on the customer to ensure these women get paid right away?</text>

I've been going to this place for almost 6 years. Farzana is the best. Anytime they hire girls for their front desk they are always really friendly and make for an all around pleasurable experience.< /text>

Very disappointed at how my eyebrows came out.  I had to go and get them fix elsewhere. Salon was not what the pictures show. With the way my eyebrows turned out it might have been the girl first time.  Will NOT return and defenetly will NOT recommend.</Text>

< review>
I came here to get my brows tinted for the very first time. I was really excited but I am so disappointed horrible job. I hate how my brows look the lady here threaded them horrible I asked for a clean up because my brows already have a shape and she went and messed them up without my consent. I will never come to this place ever again. Oh and the lady didn't clean up the tint properly she left extra tint on the edges of my brows. I had to get home and find a way to clean it.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The food is good and everything, but what it lacks is that the staff don't give you a spoon or towels. Not because you buy 4 orders of beer.

The birria was not the best and I tried other very tasty ones. The bill was more than it should have been. They charged 115 for trash they gave us. He did not recommend it.

Primera impresión fue mala, un local poco agradable, después de ordenar un café mi impresión cambió a bueno, el café tenía un olor rico y fresco sabía muy bien, todo iva mejor, lo malo fue en la comida, el menudo que ordenamos tenía un sabor desagradable para ser exactos el menudo ya estaba en descomposición sabía a malo.  La birria no era la mejor e probado otras muy ricas. La cuenta fue más de lo que debió ser.  Cobraron 115 por basura que nos dieron. No lo recomendó.</text></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) The birria does not taste like that of calvillo cualkiera sews the meat but the good thing is the sauce is that of the flavor. Rather it tastes like Beef Stitching in broth they don't steam sew if they steam sew it would be soft

(Original)
La birria no sabe como la de calvillo cualkiera cose la carne pero lo bueno es la salsa es la del sabor . Mas bien sabe como a Cosido de Res en caldo no cosen la carne a bapor si la cosieran a bapor estubierablandita< /review>

We've had several cats we've brought to All Creatures over the past 20 years, and the vets have taken good care of them.  Cats are mostly predictable in their needs. Then about 3 years ago we rescued a Border Collie, and I learned dog care is not so predictable.  I'll spare you the adventures, but Dr Mulvany has always been there and helped with even the most unusual adventures.  I highly recommend him.< /text>

My two Goldens have been seen by these doctors for over 6 years and I have found them to very thorough and knowledgeable. I have received wonderful advice that is very helpful to the well being of my dogs. They take the time to review everything after the exams, giving me a peace of mind that my dogs are healthy and happy.</review>

Sara was very helpful to take our order for dog food by phone, charge the correct account and deliver the bag to our car. It would help her more if the the two formularies of Royal Canin food were separated in the office so she could bring us the right bag on first try. She gladly exchanged the bags at our request.
Dr. Mulvaney provided excellent service and recommended new medications appropriate to her age and needs. He gave us personal and prompt services.< /Review>

<Review>As a stakeholder in this community, I am writing this review to inform other pet parents to not come here. To please go elsewhere for their pets medical needs.

After being a loyal client of more than 10 years. I have had one or more NOT positive experiences at this location. The behavior has been disgruntled employees who delight in hostility, unprofessional behavior and rude and inappropriate comments written in my pet's medical record referencing me  (that have nothing to do with his care nor his health) and finally prejudiced behavior towards me.

It is awful, what I experienced as a pet parent and I wouldn't wish it for anyone seeking help for their beloved pet. I am giving this a one star rating as I have respect for others who work here that did exhibit professional conduct when interacting with me, but I cannot say this is a majority but in fact a few individuals.

Overall, I ended this relationship for  lack of genuine concern for my pet and lack of compassion and lots of hostility; over a simple request to, “Please have his doctors give us a call”.

I do want you to consider what happened to me could easily happen to you and your pet. Consider this when you read other reviews and be cautious in who you entrust your pets too as a general rule.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND anyone to this veterinary clinic.</Review>< pics>

We have been going to All Creatures Hospital for the past 16 years.  All of their vets and staff have been wonderful in taking care of our cats.  Most recently, Dr. Mulvany assisted us.  Couldn't be happier with the  treatment he provided our cat, the confidence he inspired, and the excellent results.<//text>

All Creatures Hospital is an excellent veterinary clinic and hospital, the vets and assistants, particularly,  the assistant Matt, are extremely skilled, efficient, and treat animals beautifully.  They are very respectful of Covid and offer a great concierge service and are 100 percent compliant with CDC requirements.  i would recommend All Creatures Hospital highly to anyone needing any veterinary help, simple or complex.

<review>I have been coming to All Creatures for 20 years for 2 dogs, and my most recent visit reminds me why.  My 14-year-old mini-dachshund suddenly became disoriented last weekend, walking in a tight clockwise circle for what seemed like an hour and having trouble finding her way home when we were out walking. I was a basket case. Dr. Mulvaney kept her at All Creatures for a few hours on Monday to observe her, and told me that it seemed to be a balance issue.  He asked me to bring her back on Thursday, and after examining her again said that she appears to have a vestibular disorder and I should watch her carefully because it often goes away by itself in 2 weeks.  Other vets might have subjected her to all kinds of tests, increasing her anxiety level.  So far, the results are bearing out the diagnosis:  she is not all better yet, but can walk or run in a straight line.  And her mood is much improved!</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have nothing but good things to say about All Creatures. I was in a bind. My fur baby was out of her prescription and I needed it ASAP. I could not get it filled out of state with just the empty bottle. When I called AC and talked to Alessa? she was compassionate, professional and worked on getting this prescription filled at Costco within hours. Thank you so much! You come highly recommend by me!</review><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

We have taken our golden retrievers to All Creatures for 17 years. We feel great about the care we have received from them. Our first golden's health was challenging and All Creatures met all of them. Our current vet is Dr. Norell. I feel very good about recommending AC and Dr. Norell to any pet owner that wants to give their pet the best of care.<//Text>

All Creatures has been a home-away-from-home for us and our dogs for about 35 years. The staff members -- docs and aides and reception -- have been exceptionally expert, efficient,  kind, tender, and welcoming.  Our present pup cannot wait to go.  She goes into tremendous tail wagging when we tell her we have an appointment!  You can trust them with everything from manicures to serious problems.  You and your pets will love them!</Text>

< Review>
Our many cats have been given excellent treatment at All Creatures for over 25 years. Two lived to ripe old ages—19 and 20 years. Another had diabetes but lived into his late teens due to the vet’s care and advice. When we had to have a beloved kitty sick with cancer put to sleep, the vet was unbelievably compassionate. All the vets and staff we have met are animal lovers to the core.< /Review>

<Text>I highly recommend All Creatures Hospital!  I called them last minute and they were able to accommodate my dog, cat and guinea pig while we were on vacation.  They emailed my daily reports on how each were doing and even let my dog and cat spend time together to ease any anxiety from being away from home.  I will definitely take my pets there again for boarding and all of their medical needs.<//Text><name>M Krahenbuhl</name>< resp>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>My labradoodle had ear issues. I’ve brought him in twice for them. When he left he was shaking his head more than when he came in. My trying to wash his ears and then put in drops was very challenging since he had his ears plucked the day before. But hopefully at the end if 10 days he will be better. 🤞🏻</Text><GmapID>0x80dc08fad84b8b57:0xa1133d049f8974df<//GmapID><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>101087528042638382943< /UserId.>< time>

<review>I cannot say enough good things about this place. I took my little rescue cat to Dr. Tiglio and she was amazing. She helped my little Bear get better in no time. She explained everything with words that were easy to understand and answered any questions I had. The staff is amazing, the waiting rooms and facility is clean and you can tell that they take pride in their work. Definitely recommend.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>Cannot say enough good things about All Creatures. We were referred to Dr Jenna by a friend when we moved from VA to CA. Even though they’re 20 miles away- they’re 100% worth the drive. Our senior partner, Jack the Beagle, is loved on and cared for by everyone at AC.

We had to board Jack for 2 weeks and I swear, he came out in better condition than when we went in.

Follow up is amazing. Attention to detail A+. Knowledge and experience can’t be beat.</text><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

I've been trusting Dr. Mulvaney and All Creatures Hospital with my dogs for over 25 years.  I've tended to have senior larger-breed dogs able to live healthy lives into their teens with proper care.  I can't imagine having a better partner in providing that care than the All Creatures team.<//review>

<text>All Creatures Hospital has been very good to my pets over the years.
There has been a few times that I needed help asap and they have been there for me.  I gets my prescriptions filled very quickly and I get appointments in a timely manner as well.
The vets are very nice and know just how to handle my pets.
I have had not  issues at all.
I just had my 14 years old dog in for a dental and they were
very careful with her and assured me that they would monitor her
heart closely.  She did very well.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I absolutely LOVE the staff and veterinarians at All Creatures Hospital.  I've been referring friends here for years.  Everyone is kind, considerate and listens to each and every client.  They show their obvious love of animals in their treatment and care.  My 2 dogs have boarded here and often hate to leave.  A1 in my book!<//Review>

< Review>
To be candid and offer constructive feedback, I never know if any veterinarian knows anything since my dog may still have the same condition he was brought in for and I have no way of knowing if he received proper treatment (he cannot "tell me"). I have this problem with all vets.

The second issue is cost. I have to spend more on my dog than my children. For example, every time I bring my dog into the office, regardless of what is done, i.e. a simple injection, a prescription, I suffer the additional charge of a "concierge visit" adding $53.00 to bill. This, so called check up is characterized by "hello" and "goodbye", because nothing has changed since the last time I brought my dot into the office.

On the bright side, I find most staff to be caring and friendly and would especially like to recognize  Jenna Fransioli , who I believe is a truly caring human being.< /Review>

<review>I was looking for a new vet for my maltipoo Winston, and my parents recommended All Creatures Hospital. They take their dog Bella there and had nothing but amazing things to say about them! I’m not joking, this is hands down the most incredible place. All the doctors, vet techs, and receptionists are so kind and caring. Both Bella and Winston have had issues with their eyes, and Dr. Tiglio is an eye specialist. She is THE BEST! Whether it’s for a vaccination or a tummy bug, they always make you feel like a priority, and they even call you the next day to make sure your pet is doing better. I’m so thankful my parents referred me here, and I cannot recommend this place enough.</review>< Pics>

I have used All Creatures for decades! I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. They are so loving and knowledgeable, both the vets and the techs. I also like that their hours are so much better than many of the other vets/animal hospitals.  I highly recommend them!< /text>

All Creatures Hospital has been our veterinarian for 30+ years.  They have always taken such great care of our dogs.  We currently have two laboradors who tend to get into things :) They always answer when we call right away. The staff is on time and very knowledgeable.  We are so lucky to have them as our local vet. We can't thank them enough for all that they do!</review>

<text>We discovered All Creatures Hospital because we needed last minute boarding for our cat, Zozo. Our regular sitter canceled last minute and we are beyond grateful to have found All Creatures!!! They were not only  able to board her but they even helped us finally figure out how to help our cat with her allergies.

Prior to this, I went to 3 different vets in San Diego. We even went to a vet dermatologist that specializes in cat allergies that affect the face. After spending so much money and running so many tests and even doing a biopsy of her skin- the vets could not determine why she had allergies and how to fix it. We started giving her the prescription dry food the vet recommended and even medicine on a regular but nothing helped - her face continued to peal. She was very unhappy. The vets did not even explain to us how to monitor her to determine if she had food allergy or something else.

Coming to All Creatures Hospital I thought they would board her but at first glance the vet immediately knew what to do. By the time we returned to pick up Zozo- she was entirely different in the most positive way. Her face was so healthy, her ears didn't bother her anymore, her face "acne" was gone! Since coming back home she is so much more outgoing, happy and vocal. She meows all the time and even purrs. She does have food allergy and we are doing an elimination diet- currently she is only eating Turkey wet food and so far she is doing great. In a week or so we will take her back for a check up.

We are so HAPPY and so very appreciative of the care and love she received from the staff at All Creatures Hospital.</text></record></dataset><record>

I have counted on All Creatures Hospital since 2001. They have always listened to my concerns and issues with my dogs. The doctors are so helpful and happy to see my girls. They understand that my pets are like my children. I have full confidence in their ability to care for my girls and they will also inform me when the treatment needed is beyond the capacity and we are referred to a specialty hospital for extreme medical problems. I have never considered taking my girls to any other veterinarian.</review>

<Review>I’ve been going to All Creatures Hospital for more years than I care to remember. Why, you ask? The obvious, convenient location, good hours, great staff They are professional and compassion towards their patients. They care to do the very best they humanly can to fix your pets problem long with follow up care. There have been times when the veterinarian and I have cried together over the lost of one of my family’s pet members. I’m very proud to give them a 5-star rating as they have always been there for my pet family and for me as well. Linda Wilford< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Since 1998 I have been using All Creatures Hospital. I can confess that if it was not for them, especially Dr. Mulvany my first dog would have passed at the age of 3 or 4. She lived for 15 years and that is thanks to the care and love of All Creatures Hospital. Now I have another doggie and I always take him to All Creatures Hospital as well. Very trustworthy vets as well as the staff. I have always felt confident whenever I have used their services.

I trust All Creatures Hospital. Thank you Dr. Mulvany. You are the BEST!<//Review>

All Creatures is the best! They are so friendly, caring and sweet to make my darling Rupert feel comfortable at all times. They allow us to do drop bys when he needs a last minute 'pawdicure' nail trim and keeps us up to date on any shots needed via email. Highly recommended!< /text>

We have taken our pets (dogs and cats) to All Creatures for over 20 years. I am always struck by how much EVERYONE there (receptionists, techs, vets, etc) loves pets and how uniformly kind they are. A number of vets have practiced there during these past 2 decades and we have never worked with one in whom we did not have confidence and trust. We are currently working with Dr. Norell and really love her. She is conscientious, knowledgable and practical. The followup is wonderful-we receive a phone call after every visit and with every lab test result. We moved from Rancho Santa Fe to La Jolla 5 years ago and still bring our pets to All Creatures. We highly recommend them.</text>

I had a very good experience at Simi Valley advanced imaging. Friendly at the front desk and very patient.
The imaging technicians were also very friendly. They kept me informed about what’s going to happen in my procedure. Also very comforting  and calm throughout the whole procedure and asking me how I was doing. I definitely will use this office again and also referred others<//text>

<review>Simi Valley Advanced Imaging is the best I've been to by far. The staff was very efficient professional and accommodating. I ran a few minutes late, expected to have to wait a long X, I decided to go downstairs, and I gave the front desk my number for when they needed me, which they did within a few minutes. The whole process was smooth & seamless  The technician skilled and relieved me of any concerns I had. I was in and out faster than I have ever been at any Imaging Center and I've been to a few. I gave them a 5-star rating because they deserve it!
Thanks guys!< /review><pics>None<//pics><gmapID>0x80e8292b8c81877f:0x2381eb110d45a256<//gmapID><rating>5< /rating><date>1616787982624</date><UserId.>110722667393523238713</UserId.>< user_name>

<review>When there is an appointment made and you get there early, you shouldnt make people wait over an hour! You tell patients to get there 20 minutes early? The tech was fine. This is a scheduling problem< /review>< pics>

<Text>People were nice and professional but a had a 8am appointment told to come at 7. Waited in small waiting room wit others. ( didn’t feel comfortable with that) didn’t go in back until 9:15. Waited over 2 hours and technician said she doesn’t come in until 8:30
Very upsetting<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Overall good experience with my knee MRI. Staff pretty friendly and knowledgeable. Facility very clean and modern. Total time there about 70 minutes.
Two small issues
1. I received 3 reminder notices about my appointment, all of them insisting I come 20-25 minutes early to effect a smooth check in.
Check in took about 2 minutes ( I completed the new patient paperwork on line beforehand). But I wasnt taken to the changing area until 20 minutes after my appointment time.
2. Patient gown,  which youre required to wear is very old fashioned and if worn as designed leaves the back exposed. I think these should be upgraded.

On a positive note they have a patient portal to retrieve your results, and I was given a CD of my imaging as I left... very cool!!  thanks

Everything else was fine!!< /text>

I was referred to Simi Valley advanced imaging by Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills. Their machine is currently in operational. I found the staff to be exceptionally kind, the male staff were gentlemen. MRIs are a difficult test to endure and I found that they were very considerate. At the end I was given a CD of my test and sent home. They asked me questions that I found were very relevant. Especially since they did not have a chart in front of them.<//Text>

<Review>Clean facility, caring and patient staff. I was having an MRI of my cervical spine and I am claustrophobic. They did all they could to ease my anxiety and were sympathetic. Only issue was that when I arrived at noon for my 12:30pm appt, they let me check in , fill out all paperwork and took my copay BEFORE telling me that they were running hours behind schedule and I would need to leave a d return at 4:15pm. They did end up calling me to come back at 3:15pm after another patient cancelled. I understand things come up in the medical world and appointments get pushed back, but they should have told me before checking me in and definitely before charging my card.</Review></record></dataset><record>

It would be nice if someone would call the patients and fully explain the procedure to be done and expectations. I had to cancel my MRI and reschedule for a CT scan because of an implant. No one asked me any questions until I arrived and that was the tech. Asking important questions right before a procedure is not the right time. Perhaps hire someone to call patients and review procedures BEFORE the scheduled procedure.<//Review>

The radiologist Manny was really excellent in his assisting me with the CT Scan.  He explained the purpose,  how the machine worked, how long it would take and assisted me with getting on and off the machine table.<//Text>

I wish they would've taken patients temperatures (perhaps in the hallway) prior to entering.  Not having multiple patients sit in the lobby waiting with others seems like an appropriate policy to enact - call patients on their cell phones when ready to have them walk into the imaging room.  Patients that fill out the online questionnaire in advance shouldn't have to wait more than 15 minutes.  Other than that, everyone was kind and polite.< /text><Date>1611867520724<//Date>< userid>

It was the best experience I have ever had.the staff was so thoughtfully and helpful.
Hope if I even have to have a CT scan again I will be sent there.

<Text>Procedure and appointment was great, the office asking for payment creates problem later, since this procedure is “ preventative “ Anthem will pay 100 % so when I pay with my HSA account Rolling Oaks will “ refund “ me the money spent and it’s a pain in the neck re- deposit in my account I don’t understand why you people don’t bill the insurance and what the insurance doesn’t pay I will, this is how all other medical providers do<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

This morning,  I had a CT Scan with contrast for an Ascending Aorta Aneurysm. I was a little apprehensive bc my veins are deep and difficult to find. But I had no problem at all! The Imaging Technician has a lot of experience and he didn't have any problem in finding the vein for the IV</Text>

Everyone Was kind and thoughtful. I have bad veins it took an hour to get one for contrast. They never made me feel bad for taking up so much of their time. Also when a doctor recommends a place it’s usually for a reason. As not all radiologist are equal as not all doctors are equal in diagnosis and compassion.  Will go there again.</text>

I did appreciate the fact that they contacted me re they were running behind but, my appointment got moved 3 times and I was supposed to return to work which created a late day.
Everyone was polite and helpful.  Some days r out of people's control.</Text>

I didn't catch the name of the woman who helped me out in the front office, but she was also very kind and informative. My images were given to me quickly, and although getting an MRI is never the most comforting experience, Kate made me feel very comfortable during. I would absolutely return here for future needs, and reccomend them to anyone I know!</text>< pictures>

Only complaint I have is that I was told my appt was at 1:30 so that’s when I arrived., When I had not been called in by 2:15 I asked why the delay. Was told he was just finishing with someone and would be calling me in very shortly. He did call my name to come in at 2:30.. an hour after my appt time. I mentioned to him about waiting an hour and he told me he had me scheduled for 2:30 not 1:30 and was very sorry for the mix up. These things do happen which is why I’m still giving 5 stars.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The receptionist was a lovely young woman who made sure I was served promptly, answered my questions and was so helpful. The technician, Manny, was also friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating as I am wearing a boot on my injured foot and required help.
The whole experience was great, and I would recommend Simi Valley imaging to everyone.< /review>

Not a bad place. I was told to get there an hour early, which I did. It was not necessary. I then had to wait an hour and a half to be called in. It would have been nice to have had some input from the office staff as to what was going on. I had to keep asking. The CT Scan took al of 15 minutes. I was there for 2 hours< /Review>

We had a 10am appointment For an MRI and they continued to push us back due to the ease of people getting CT scans. We finally had the MRI at 11:45. Why?</text>

My MRI technologist, Mike, was very professional and checked with me, asking how I was doing, many times during the, approximately, 45 minute process (with contrast and without). I didn’t have any issues in the “tube”, but if you’re claustrophobic or have sensitive hearing and are unable to keep your head still, I imagine that the process could take a bit longer.  Mike will be understanding.</Text>

I arrive and proceed to check-in, only to be told my appt isn't until 10:30. A little frustrated that no one was able to offer an explanation to why their computer showed something different.

I go back at 10:20am, and their credit card machine was having issues, and I waited for 30 mins to be called in. Not a smooth operation.

<review>IMHO if you live and work in Simi Valley, you’ll perhaps love this place. But my experience was negative. I waited 30 minutes longer than my appointment time to be seen, just to finish in 20 minutes. Kudos to the rad tech!  Also, I received three phone calls about different appointment times which was confusing and unnecessary. If it were my choice, I’d go elsewhere.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80e8292b8c81877f:0x2381eb110d45a256<//gmap_id></record>

<text>The staff was friendly and professional!  The technician couldn’t have been any kinder to me!  It made things much easier!  The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is the fact that “comfort”  isn’t taken into consideration when someone is in extreme pain.  I know in some cases it’s unavoidable, but maybe not in others 🤷🏼‍♀️
I have severe chronic back pain.  Maybe a stool to help me onto the machine?  Something softer than metal to lay on ~ we hurt, we’re not allowed to move a muscle, and we could be laying like that for ages!  Something more comfortable would be a godsend!
The music is great ~ the volume needs to be higher to hear the music over the banging of the machine.
One more thing..... they might want to clean the carpet outside their door in the hallway ~ it’s a great topic of conversation for the patients!😉
Just a few suggestions, but otherwise, the staff did everything possible to make me as comfortable as I could be.  Kudos to them!!<//text><username>Alison Grugan< /username>< Rating>

Everything was fine. There was a problem with getting my secondary insurance approved. Hopefully they were able to resolve the problem. I was pleasantly surprised that the procedure was not as noisy as I expected.< /text>

<text>Staff is very nice and compassionate. They were running behind and called me an hour
before my appointment to let me know and if I could come later. I started to have a panic attack when going into the mri machine and the ladies were super nice and got me through it and kept checking on me. No problems and was able to finish my mri. Thank you for being so nice!</text>< pictures>

<review>The people there were very nice.  But there was no reason to arrive 30 minutes early for the appointment to do 5 minutes of paperwork.  Additionally they were running 20-25 minutes late which they knew when we arrived.  They should have called and adjusted our arrival time accordingly.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

My experience was pretty good- the MRI  technician was very kind & understood how claustrophobic I was. The MRI itself went smoothly. The one downfall is know your own benefits before going in- the front desk people don’t know basic benefits.</text>

<Review>I was in and out quickly. They didn't hound me for my co-pay right when I got there as some offices do these days out of paranoia they wont get paid; I was able to pay on my way out. They put my scan on a disc right then and there and didn't charge me for it, or the additional copy I requested.  The MRI went by quickly and they let me listen to music during the scan.<//Review>< Time>

I found out that this place has a couple names and a couple numbers by which they do business. At the drs, I was given a list of places to get a CT scan done for my son. I first called SV Advanced Imaging, I briefly gave them our insurance info and explained the deadline we were working against. They said 5-7 days before our insurance would clear to be able to get it done. (I know this wasn't the case as I have a PPO and I've had these tests myself) Politely declined and called the number for Rolling Oaks in Simi.  Went through the same conversation as above and Alicia worked on clearing us right away. She needed notes from the dr and made the effort to get them so the test could be approved and performed the same day.

We were a little perplexed to walk in and see that Rolling Oaks was SV Advanced because our care was so different on the phone.

So it just goes to show that you can't judge a company on one employee's response. The first person on the phone wasn't rude,  she just was not helpful like Alicia at Rolling Oaks aka Simi Valley Advanced

We received polite and courteous care while at the facility directly, from the front office to the tech. My son was comfortable doing the test.<//review>

<Text>Walked in to make an appointment, and they were able to take me in the same day for my MRI. I asked to see the MRI machine before my exam because I hate being in tight places. The technician was polite and nice. She took care of me very well assisting me into room asking me if I'd like to listen to some music to block out the MRI machine. The headphones were the best thing to get me relaxed. Best experience I have ever had with nice courteous staff. They didn't rush me at the beginning for my copay!</Text>< Pics>

They were compassionate and extremely helpful in getting me through my anxiety and the test.

My reason for being here is very traumatic,  but the staff is very supportive and have made each trip through the MRI a stress free process.</text>

This place was easy to get to and the staff is efficient and friendly. My technician was very professional and made me feel at ease and very comfortable thru the entire procedure. I recommend their office for anyone needing an MRI. If I ever need another, SVAI is where I will go.< /text>

The front desk was super nice and on top of everything. The imaging woman was the sweetest ever! She made sure I was warm and comfortable. She also had some head phones for music to play. No one likes the sound inside those machines. As the same time I was there. Apparently there was a rude man (husband informed me) they were so patient with him. I give these girls a 5 star because they deserve it!< /text>

Simi Valley Advanced Imaging is the best place I've ever been to for an MRI or a CT and with my body I've got arthritis in just about every joint so I've had quite a few MRIs and I've got a polyp on my lung so that means I'm in there once a year for a CT to make sure it hasn't gotten any bigger they are always very very helpful if you have any questions or concerns they will address them right away they treat you with respect it's none of this you know don't worry about it kind of stuff show. I highly recommend him for any of your radiology needs<//text>

< Review>
Nobody likes having to get an MRI - I’ve had several now but honestly after my experience the other day I will forever request this office. It was very nicely decorated I was helped right away and the best part the Tech (forgot his name) was so kind and made me so comfortable also giving me my choice of music 🎶 to listen to. I relaxed and before I knew it my MRI was complete. If the owners see this message my appt was 1/5 I’m B. Gorman my appt time was 9:30-am your staff at that time we’re great👍< /Review>

They were able to get me right in, and it was a very professional experience. They explained what was going to be done, the length and expect what to expect during the procedure.</review>

Horrible. I was asked to checked in at 6:50 pm. My appointment was at 7:15. I came at 6:40 and I had to redo paperwork I did in Thousand Oaks last Saturday the 12th.  Thousand Oaks scheduled me for Saturday to check in at 6:30 am and they didn’t even have a technician<//Review>
