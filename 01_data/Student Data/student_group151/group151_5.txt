<Text>Very very unhappy with competitive edge cycler's service. I purchased cycling shoes and tried them out that same day (lightly) to see how they actually performed and felt. Unfortunately Not what I expected but I wasn’t to worried because on the receipt and on the website of competitive edge cyclery they clearly state that any returns within 30 days of purchase would be refunded or replaced, in this case a refund. I spoke to Mark the owner of both shops and he just gave me the runaround without even looking at the shoes ! Don’t recommend this place at all if your considering going here go to Incycle or Roy’s instead !!</Text>< pictures>

<review>AJ went out of his way to help me today and honestly I felt like I got hooked up with everything he did. I didnt have much cash on me so i tipped him what i could at the time. I'm def planning on throw a bit more his way in the future to complete the tip. Even if it's simple work for him, its convenient for me. Much appreciated today for their prompt and great service.<//review><rate>5</rate><userid>105034504139198626687<//userid>< Pictures>

<Review>Mark and his staff are knowledgeble and able to fix anything from the simple to the elusive. Example, I had a clicking sound whenever I applied the front brakes. I took it to a chain bike shop near my office and they charged me to remove "metal build up" in my pads. On my first ride the noise was still there so I didn't go back. Instead I stopped in to see Mark and his crew and they diagnosed it as a dry headset. After a quick lube my favorite road bike was good as new. They have fixed other quirky problems for me since and their drive train cleaning is the best in the area. I highly recommend their shops.<//Review>< user_id>

< Review>
Owner and mechanics are very friendly, my mtb shifter cable snapped and Mechanic Julio fixed it within minutes. I thought I would have to leave the bike for a few hours to be fixed. Also did not have to pay extra for express service. This is the only bike shop I trust to service my bike.<//Review>

The dentist staff here always seems very happy and they are all super friendly so that's always a good sign!! I'm not sure if their prices are crazy or if my insurance just BLOWS but I've always had to pay slightly extra and my teeth honestly aren't even that bad 😭 Also just expect to be there for a while, not necessarily because they are slow or anything but they typically just like to do any extra procedure on you right away, which is actually sorta nice!  Plus Dr. Morris = 🌶️ 😂< /Text>

I had to reschedule but decided to cancel due to the bad service.

I called weeks later to check on my refund as they required me to send a deposit of $50 to even book my appointment. They promised me a refund and two weeks later still nothing.

I called this morning, and I was told I was not receiving a refund and they gave me a difficult time just to refund my $50. They decided not to refund me even when two staff members promised to refund me previously. Instead of staying true to their word they called me to say I was not receiving what I was promised. I lost $50 for terrible service and services i never received.

I should have stayed away when my family  told me they used to go here and switched due to inconsistency and lack of good customer service.

Do not go here, they are not here to help you just to cut a check however possible.</Review>< pics>

<text>I went to Dr. Zinman at this practice and he was AMAZING. I am very afraid of mouth pain and had never had any kind of oral procedure. He was very gentle with the numbing injections and he was able to extract my wisdom tooth, saving me so much money on an oral surgeon. I have never had such a gentle dentist appointment, and such great staff experiences. Debbie and Lucy (the dental assistants) were fun and kind. I would highly recommend him!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dr Zinman, Debbie, Lucy and Javier were great. I came in with a really bad toothache and they treated me so nice. I was scared but everyone from the front desk to the assistants and the Dentist were so good to me. I ended up needing a root canal. The procedure  was hard, I don’t like dentists, but Dr. Zinman and his assistant Debbie did everything to make me feel comfortable. And they are really excited to help me get back my dental health. I will be going back there and am definitely going to recommend this office for anyone looking for dental care. Great positive environment!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< date>

I had to get multiple root canals and a deep cleaning and the experience was very pleasant. He talked to me the whole time, made jokes and frequently checked with me to make sure I was comfortable and in no pain. He listened about my concerns for keeping the remainder of my teeth and made that a top priority. In the past, dentist have just been quick just to pull my teeth.

I have been coming to this dental office for almost 2 years and have nothing bad to say about them. If I can give them 10 stars I soooo would. They are always willing to work with their patients and their needs. My kids also love coming here. Really nice staff members they have from receptionist desk to the back office. But most important I love how clean they maintain the office!! THE BEST!!!</Text>

Dr. Zinman was great! I came for a root canal, worried about pain, but  I didn't feel a thing, not even the numbing shots.
Dr. Zinman and the rest of the staff are all very curteous and friendly.
I definitely recommend Dt. Zinman at Long Beach Family Dentist.<//Review>

My husband and I went to these offices after going to a different dentist/orthodontist. The staff was kind, patient, and understanding. The doctors were professional and willing to explain any concerns regarding treatment.  I never felt they were trying to upsell any of their products.

Thank you for your professionalism 😁< /Review>

My family went to this dentist office for the first time yesterday.  Everyone was super sweet, from the receptionists to the hygienist to the woman taking x-rays. The space is spacious and bright and clean.  And I’ve never seen a better price for out of pocket customers. Even though we’re moving to a different city, I’m still planning to bring us back here in 6 months for our next dental appointments.  So glad we got a flyer and found your office!</Review>

<review>I went to LB Family Dental without an appointment and they worked me into their schedule. I didn’t have to wait long. I had a tooth ache. The next day I came to the office before my scheduled appointment and again they worked me in. I ended up having to have a rotten tooth extracted ( which did not show up on x ray either day) Dr Cruz and Dr Al were both wonderful. The staff is caring and compassionate and work well together. Many thanks to Augustine, Debby, the front office lady and the other dental assistant ( sorry I can’t remember your names) and Drs Al and Cruz!</review>< Pictures>

I had an issue with the female dentist who assisted with helping fix my broken retainer who was extremely rude and didn’t seem like she knew what she was doing. She squirted some type of blue substance all over my pants and didn’t even acknowledge or apologize for doing so. I also was there for two hours for something that could have taken 30minutes. Most likely will not be returning.</Review>< Pics>

Horrible service if you want cheap treatment and high $$ paying out pocket for unprofessional dental care.my mom had her teeth stained and had to go back not only once but 3 times for temp crown and 2 times for permanent crown.Dentist stated that it was my moms fault which is sad because she dosent drink coffee or tea why would someone say that to a patient you stained your teeth. i and my family don't recommend thus place and very infuriated.< /text>

The cash prices are reasonable and they will always work with me if I need a payment plan. The office is clean. I think the staff could work on their intercommunication skills.  I've experienced longer than expected wait times and miscommunications about treatment and scheduling.  For example, the hygienist said to come back in 4 months and the front desk person automatically tried to schedule me in 6 months without checking my chart to see what my treatment plan is. Also there was an issue with my nightgaurd where it was never properly fitted for me. In the end they did remedy the issue with no extra charge, it just took extra time.  Overall I have been happy with this office and have recommended them to family and friends.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>The staff is friendly but I would not recommend getting dental services here. Another review on here described it as a "used car buying" experience and that is spot on.

Part of my bonding was chipped off due to the rough cleaning that I received. I am aware that bondings are not a permanent fix and do eventually chip/crack but it would have not happened so quickly had I not gone there. I went back hoping to have it fixed and they did not fix it. I was instructed to floss very gently to prevent the binding from chipping/coming off in the future which is ironic because they were the opposite of gentle when cleaning my teeth in that spot.

They tried to up-sell me on everything both times. Upon reading other reviews it seems as though they are up-selling a lot of patients on the "deep cleaning".  I went here because I got a coupon for the cleaning, exam, and whitening deal (they won't actually whiten your teeth) but I will never go back and plan on returning to my previous dentist and paying a little bit more for quality ethical services.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

< review>
Do not go to Long Beach Family Dentist.  The office staff are rude and inconsiderate.  I had an appointment at 9:30 a.m.  I took time off work and arrived early at 9:14.  I needed a consultation on getting two implants, I have received quotes for $6000 and $8000 for these two implants, so I was shopping around for a better price.  I had CDs with X-ray files and CT scans to show the doctor.  I only needed the doctor to look at the documents and provide me with a quote for work.

The first problem I had was that the doctor showed up late for work, he did not arrive until 10:30.

The second problem I had was that the office manager would not let me take my child into the dentist office with me.  The office manager could have told me about their no-child policy before I waited an hour, instead she had me wait and only told me children were not allowed after I had been there for over an hour.

This office does not have any kid's toys or crayons like most dentist offices have, and it seems their office manager hates children.  I only needed 10 minutes with the doctor for him to review my chart and check in my mouth, I didn't even need a cleaning.

I will not be going back to Long Beach Family Dentistry, my child will not go to Long Beach Family Dentistry, nor will my husband.  We also plan to tell all our friend and neighbors how inconsiderate and mean the office manager is.

Other dental offices I have visited have no problem watching a child for 10 minutes so they can earn thousands of dollars.<//review>

< review>
Had a good experience today.  I been a patient here for many years (over twelve years), it was formerly Dr.Campbell. Andrea greeted me and got my folder set up. Toni is very friendly and answers any questions you have promptly. I have known Toni since I been a patient before 2005 and when I always come in she greets you with a smile and makes you appointment enjoyable. Today Jovani and Dr.Joan made this experience great. I had a dents crown placed. They were gentle when my tooth was sensitive, they work great together. I also like when Jovani and Dr.Joan work together, they like to tell jokes to make the experience more enjoyable. I recommend coming when there is no Ortho appointments. The first Monday and third Monday's are usually when Ortho is there. If you need to make an appointment on those Monday's, then do it before schools out, before 3:00 pm. I recommend this Dentist for new patients.<//review>

<Review>This place has amazing food. The salad is so fresh, its literally vegetables picked from their own garden. The dressing is flavorful and unique. I recommend also getting a combo platter to try every delicious dish and a moringa shake. Be prepared to wait as its made frlm scratch to order. Sometimes they even have to pick and wash the veges for the salad.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

This place is great. It's has a cafe with unique foods and vegetarian options. There's a museum section with artifacts. A stage with performances, lessons, kids events, and traveling events all year. They have unique events that represent different cultures on our globe. The people working here are friendly and are excited to share their culture, stories, and even recommend a menu item. Stop by and don't forget to leave a donation so they can keep hosting free and low costs events.<//text>

Beautiful place! Has a little food kiosk(mostly organic products and delicious, by the way), historical yet artisticdisplays of African culture and welcoming staff. It immerses you in our heritage in the most pleasing way. They have dance lessons, summer camps, and a whole bunch off activities for adults and children alike. Exactly what you'd expect from a cultural center.<//Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>World Beat cultural center is a big round covered structure in Balboa Park that presents different events and activities. I started attending their free yoga class held every Wednesday from 5_6 pm , very nice and laid back for all different levels with a great instructor. If you like yoga this class would be ideal . It is free, certified instructor and gentle. World beat center is located around  2100 park blvd by children's playground.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I’m not typically one for vegan food but omg it was great. When we arrived there was a class for traditional African drumming and music. I was sitting and watching with my toddler and the instructor told me to join in. I had a lot of fun smacking the drum. We also ordered a young coconut. Ended up ordering another it was so freakin good. I definitely want to go again. Staff was super friendly.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< gmap_id>

A cultural center in the midst of an urban setting. Home to many children's services, artists, culture classes and the like. The backdrop and home of the San Diego Heirloom seedswap as well as the setting for numerous other seed sovereign projects. This place has a stellar cafe, and is complete with a children's ethnobotany peace garden where produce is grown year round for the cafe and as well as for the community to learn in.</text>

<Review>This renovated 1 million gallon water tower on the edge of Balboa Park was repurposed and revitalized by the vision and hard work of Makeda Cheatom, the World Beat Center Team, and the loving community that surrounds it. Over 23 years later it’s doors have been open every day to all people, regardless of color or creed, as a place to celebrate all cultures, all art, all music, all dance, and all people.
With the inside walls covered in murals by local artists brightly commemorating important leaders and historical cultures, there are multiple galleries and small shops within the building serving healthy local foods, locally sourced goods, and a gallery of art and artifacts. Flags of all the nations are flying from the ceiling while the stage and dancefloor have been host of hundreds of famous and upcoming acts, artists, and events to the delight of tens of thousands of fans and attendees.
Known throughout California and Mexico for its exterior murals celebrating Egyptian, African, and Indigenous Cultures, the WorldBeat Center is leading as one of the most-important multicultural art and event centers in San Diego. Throughout the years, the sustainable advancements to the building has garnered such achievements as:
LEED Certified Building
USGBC Green Building
Fully Sustainable Recycling and Composting Program
Six Solar Tube Lighting Fixtures
Handi-capable Bathroom Facilities
Balboa Park Sustainability Award for Aquaponics</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Worldbeat Center is at the heart of many movements and serves to cultivate peace for all living beings. I would compare this place to the museums of Balboa Park, yet it is so very much more.

I love so many things about this place: the lively dance parties, the sustainable garden, the children's program, international school and the charismatic leader's passion for speaking to the rich indigenous history uniting the roots of all people. There is Kombucha on tap which is fresh and delicious. There is a cafe and kitchen open on select days. Also, you can rent the space for events! All generations and cultures are at home here. This is a place for the people.

So I consider this a living museum and a place where culture and science collide in the dance of life. From the Earth to the Stars, Worldbeat Center brings wisdom into cultural consideration. As a center of expanding concern the subjects "curated" in this cultural nexus run the gamut from sustainable gardening to astronomy as the history of wisdom is given voice. Peace is a practice and in San Diego, Worldbeat Center keeps the heart beat of unity alive and well situated in this living museum of soul, spirit and sustainable prosperity.</Text>

eMarketing has been helping us with an SEO project over the course of the last few months. Our project manager Niel, and all of his colleagues, have been doing a tremendous job of sending progress reports and keeping us in the loop regarding their progress. I'd recommend their services to anyone looking to optimize their presence online.<//text>

I would highly recommend their services!  I would specifically like to mention that Andre and Matthew have done an incredible job for me, and I cannot be more thankful for their efforts.  Whenever I talk to them, they are very professional with me, and I feel that they genuinely care about addressing my concerns.  I can say that this is a service where I really feel like I am being taken care of.  Thank you guys again!<//text>

I will NEVER use this company again or trust anyone who calls to sell me something over the phone for making the business better in anyway.   Note to self to stick with what I know and people that I trust from previous work/project.  Thanks for the lazy work of just copying my old website information and putting it on top of a different client's website.  "Real Creative"....NOT!

If anyone reads this I would definitely recommend to go elsewhere if you want a new look and updated look for your business's website.</Review>

<review>Mat has done a fantastic job with our Pay Per Click advertising on Google, even getting our 5 star reviews attached to our Product Listing Ads - not a small accomplishment!  I've been working on this for over a year!  Also reduced cost per click and conversion.  SEO is doing well also.  Thank you.< /review>< time>

Place is very bad. Recommended clients to them that I signed up. Never got the work that was promised. Made me look bad.

Edited:
Funny that you say 95% of the clients I signed up are still with you. Because when I asked about my commission check you said they cancelled. Yes I am an ex-employee. I brought in clients from my personal portfolio.< /Text>

< Review>
We have been VERY happy seeing how our website improved. I was hesitant to spend on external SEO before, but my partners got me to try it, and it was a good investment. We're growing more already with all the leads and conversions we've had. Special thanks to Preston, and thanks everyone at eMarketing Concepts.</Review>

<text>Finding a good marketing company is a lot like looking for a good relationship. Takes a few attempts, and you'll probably have a disaster or two along the way. But when you do finally find it, the trouble was worth it. More than one "SEO service" tried to take our money and run, and we had others that were alright, but not quite what we wanted. But it looks like the search is over! We're happy with what eMarketing Concepts has done.<//text><userid>112786393835148932515</userid>< time>

They do nothing...their strategy although has worked for others is what is called "black hat". You will see some results...wait until Google finds out and places a ban on your domain name. Panda and penguin are very intuitive.  You will be sent to the "sandbox" for penalty or be kicked off Google and out of business. Build listing citations on your own and create healthy reviews from your customers.</Review>

<text>I don't do this kind of thing often, but the help I've had from eMarketing Concepts has really made a difference, and that's worth recognizing. We were really struggling with our online marketing, in part because we just didn't have anyone that tech-savvy on our team. The concept of meta descriptions and "alt tags" was confusing. eMC helped us figure it out and make our online presence an asset rather than the hassle it used to be. Much appreciated.< /text>< GmapID>

While its been a little frustrating to change project managers a few times during our EMC relationship,  Maisie Peters, our SEO Program Project Manager,  is a blessing. She is a great communicator, does what she says she is going to do and knows her way around SEO Best Practices.

Since beginning with eMarketing Concepts, I've been really impressed by how communicative our project manager has been. He's given us all the updates that we've expected on our progress, but also been readily available to answer other questions for us, which has been a huge relief for folks like us who are relatively new to SEO.< /review>

We would have had a really tough time running our PPC campaigns; our staff is small, and kept busy with orders. It's great having someone we can count on to handle the marketing while we focus on our product.<//Review>

So we were kind of hesitant to jump into PPC and professional SEO and such, because we thought we had everything pretty under control. Needless to say, we were blown away by how much we *didn't* know, and eMarketing Concepts was just a help. We would definitely recommend them!< /Text>

I would not recommend this company. We paid them premium price for 2 companies for 13 months only to find our that nothing that was supposed to get done was. We started the process to go with a new company and they wanted our Google Analytical information...when we tried to get that from Emarketing we found out they never even set it up at all. So for the past year they took our money but didn't give what promised. This was just one of many items that they were contractually paid to provide and they didn't. Every time I try to contact them I get the runaround. Steer Clear!< /review>

eMarketing Concepts has helped me quite a bit though the years. They take the complicated, difficult aspects of SEO and make them so simple for me. My rankings have consistently been at the top of search engines. I'm very happy with my SEO results. I recommend eMarketing Concepts to anyone who wants to improve their SEO.</text>

This company was really slick during the sales process. However once they charge you the set up fee and get you on board they disappear. It was extremely fustrating dealing with them. They did not deliver anything they said they would. Then when I wanted to cancel they never responded to my request and I had to file a dispute with amex.</review>

I used this company for 2 years; complete scam and despite repeated requests to end the service, continued to bill my credit card each month.  They will not answer the phone or reply to emails sent.  PLEASE beware.</review>

<review>Our boss initially wanted all our SEO to be done in house...but couldn't find anyone with SEO training or skills. It was a mess; we didn't know what was going on, or how to choose keywords or boost our rankings. After much wheedling, we got the boss to try an outside service, and eMarketing came to our rescue. The difference has been night and day. Thanks!<//review>< pics>

<review>OUTSOURCES TO PAKISTAN, horrible link quality, overpromises and under delivers, figured out they are formerly CAPTAIN MARKETING just re-branded. Read the reviews that aren't at the top of YELP. Scroll to the bottom and click the button to read the reviews that weren't posted to get a full picture of what kind of business they are.

I worked with E Marketing concepts for 4 months. I should of listened to my instincts when within the first week I had a notification that someone tried to login to my Google account from Pakistan. I was assured by my Project Manager that it hadn't came from their company so I changed my password and gave them another shot. Over the course of the next 4 months I had multiple logins from Pakistan even though they told me that everything was done "in house" HA!

These people are liars and crooks. They offered me free service eventually after I wasn't getting any traffic and my site was going down in rankings. I accepted and they STILL CHARGED ME THE FOLLOWING MONTH. I spoke with Matthew, the manager, who assured me a refund would be processed. The refund eventually was processed from my cc company in the form of a chargeback.

The social media is a joke! Why do I want a post saying "Mondaze"??? HOW IS THAT GOING TO HELP MY BUSINESS BECOME MORE VISIBLE ONLINE.

This company is full of it. They say they are Google Partnered but all that really means is they manage a certain amount of adwords budget. Don't be fooled.

My project manager did all he could but when you outsource your "Optimizations" to Pakistan, what can he really do?

STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY IF YOU WANT YOUR BUSINESS TO GROW and if you don't want to be blacklisted from Google's listings.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Date>1476740979741< /Date>< rate>

I would NEVER recommend this company.  I hired them for both SEO and Social Media, they did some Social Media but did ZERO SEO services that they promised as follows:

Onsite Optimization

Incoming Links: 32  (NEVER GOT 1 LINK)
Web 2.0 links: 2  (NEVER GOT 1 LINK)
Keywords Tracked: 30 (NOTHING EVER CHANGED)
XML sitemap (I ALREADY PRODUCED THIS MYSELF WITH OUR OWN INTEGRATED PLUG-INS)

Homepage optimization (THEY NEVER MODIFIED MY HOMEPAGE AT ALL)
Homepage title tag  (AGAIN NEVER MODIFIED)
Homepage description  (AGAIN NEVER MODIFIED)
Hyperlink Optimization  (SO VAGUE BUT AGAIN THEY DIDN"T MODIFY ANYTHING ON OUR SITE FOR THAT MATTER)
Sitemap generation  (I ALREADY PRODUCED THIS MYSELF WITH OUR OWN INTEGRATED PLUG-INS)
Copyscape Review & Status Report  (NEVER SEEN ANY REPORT FROM COPYSCAPE)
Alt tags  (NOTHING DONE OUR SITE EVER, MAYBE SOME OTHER SITE, J UST NOT OURS)
Subpage title (Half in Month 1, Half in Month 2): 6  (NOTHING DONE ON OUR SITE)
Subpage description (Half in Month 1, half in Month 2): 6  (NOTHING DONE ON OUR SITE)
Directory submission and optimization: 20  (NEVER PROVIDED ANY LINKS OF ANY DIRECTORIES THEY SUPPOSEDLY SUBMITTED TO)
Map Embed  (NOTHING MODIFIED ON OUR SITE SO.....)
Google Local Verification  (DONT KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IF THEY DID THIS)
Social media badge placement  (NOTHING MODIFIED ON OUR SITE AGAIN)
Google Publisher  (DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS IS, THEY NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT)
Facebook Likes (First month only): 10  (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)
Blog posting (Starts Month 2): 100 words (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)
Twitter posting (Starts Month 2): 2 (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)
Facebook posting (Starts Month 2): 2 (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)
Google+ posting (Starts Month 2): 2 (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)

They did do their social media like they outlined in our contract, however they did absolutely nothing on the SEO (what they call National SEO) side of our contract.

I was taken to the woodshed and filed a chargeback with AMEX only to be declined because AMEX didn't even know what SEO was.  EMarketing Concepts provided proof of what they did on the social media aspect and AMEX figured that was good enough.

BEWARE, BEWARE, BEWARE!  And if you DON"T LISTEN, don't say I DIDN'T WARN YOU!<//review>

<response>{'time': 1474990778710, 'text': "We do apologize that you had to have multiple managers on your account, but we did our best to connect you with the right project manager. Once you started working with Matthew, things were going well and communication was very open and consistent. Like we talked about on the phone, we delivered on everything promised to you. We optimized your website, built the agreed upon links, and ran Facebook ads for you website.\nThe reason we had a delay in refunding your account was because you had sent your cancellation request after your bill date. We have a 48 hour window that allows for cancellation, but you were outside of this window. We did refund you the money in the end because we wanted to be fair.\n\nAfter the refund, you left us a negative Yelp review. We did not believe this review was warranted because of the time your project manager dedicated to your campaign. I work with him closely and know the hours he spent on the phone with you and your website. At the end of the day we offered you free service because we wanted to make this work for you. You spoke with your project manager again and decided it wasn't something you wanted and instead left another negative review.\n\nYour website is ranked very well for your keywords, but people are not signing up for classes. Ultimately that was your goal and we did our best to get you results. Unfortunately, our service does not guarantee to get you sign ups, but we did get you great rankings. We are happy to post your ranking reports.\n\nI do not think a 1star review is fair or warranted in this situation. I would be happy to speak with you further to resolve this issue."}<//response><text>I was solicited by an eMarketing Concepts telemarketer during October 2015.  I had 0 interest in his company's services.  He transferred me to a senior sales exec who gave me a special trial offer of service for 2 months at the price of 1 month.  Against my better judgment, I signed up for a Pinterest campaign for an established retail business and a Facebook campaign for a new separate business.  The senior sales exec assured me that the advertising would generate new leads for both businesses, the campaign managers would change the ads to get results, and I can end service on a monthly basis.

The manager for the Pinterest campaign was a veteran worker who created Pinterest boards with no problem, but since there were no sales I suspended the campaign when the 2 month trial ended.

I was initially paired with two managers for the Facebook campaign who were both new to the company.  They both took vacations within a week of being assigned to my account, didn't listen to my input, didn't provide me with a mock ad to approve, and ran low quality ads without my approval.  Before my 2 month trial ended, I was paired with a third manager who was one of the most experienced on staff.

The third manager did a much better job than the first 2 managers.  I wound up keeping the Facebook campaign going for another 3 months, but there were no results even though we tried different pictures, verbiage, new audiences, etc.  The effect was the same as rearranging deck chairs on a sinking Titanic.

The third Facebook manager also sold me on some minor services to tweak a business website like adding home page content (which I edited heavily) and a Word Press blog that I didn't need at all.

During the final month, I was billed for an incorrect amount.  To avoid refunding me, the third manager tried offering services like overpriced website blog posts and press releases but I declined.  After 3 weeks, the third manager couldn't tell me when I would be refunded.  I received a refund on the day my credit card company processed a charge back.

The senior sales exec was very smooth and reasonable-sounding.  I regret listening to her.  She said eMarketing is a major online marketer that will do great things for the 2 businesses I wanted to promote.  Both the senior sales exec and the third Facebook campaign manager said on the one hand they will generate a lot of online exposure that will lead to sales and on the other hand they can't guarantee results.  They can only perform work for their clients.

The Pinterest campaign required work, which I didn't have the time to do myself and I was unfamiliar with the Pinterest platform.  The Facebook campaign charged me for ads that I could have developed myself without paying eMarketing a monthly fee to work for me.

Since I hadn't tried Pinterest and Facebook advertising before, I decided to give eMarketing a try.

Unfortunately, all I did was waste my time and money.

If businesses have time and in house staff to develop their own online social media marketing campaigns, they're better off doing so rather than paying third parties to put out ads with no results.

eMarketing offered me free SEO service for 6 months in an effort to make amends for my dissatisfaction with its social media marketing.  After the nature of the temporary and permanent back links were explained to me, though, I decided to pass on the offer.  As I understood things, the temporary links with more business data were more effective at promoting a website’s online presence while the more permanent links which are picture based weren’t as effective at capturing the attention of Google search robots.

I’ve learned a few things about online advertising.  Online advertising can only attempt to increase a business’ web presence and/or potential consumer awareness.  Every form of online advertising I’ve tried hasn’t generated nearly enough leads to pay for the expense much less make a profit.  I’ll advertise myself from now on.</text>< rating>

<review>Once these guys got our credit card info, they vanished for nearly 6 weeks. When we called to find out what was happening they said to wait for the first monthly report, which turned out to be nothing more than an assemblage of data we could get anytime from our Google Adwords account. It took several more weeks for them to 'get in touch' with their technicians to let us know what actions had been taken on the account, which was minimal. Dreadful customer service. They did not even reply to our request for a refund.</review>< name>

Great gas station. It has 12 pumps and a large extra mile. Close to a lot of fast food and Subway.< /Review>

The rudest people . And they need to work on their personal hygiene. Can’t stand this chevron. Out of line how they treat you, especially the chick with glasses that looks like daria. Also I heard them saying racist things, the three ladies that were working and also laughing at their customers. So disrespectful</Review>

< Review>
I think this place hacked my CC account after buying gas here..twice!!!  Both times the gas pump says "See attendant".  None of my cards worked at the pump. I had to go inside and give card to attendant.  Three days later I get a fraudulent charge to my card...happened twice..Go figure.. Now I go up the road (east) a mile to a place on the left..better price also.< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>I wish I had better things to say about this place but I was really disappointed by my experience here because this company has a lot to offer. I went in a hurry for a power bank charger. The PUGS brand I purchased was taped where it should have been sealed--sign of an open product. When I opened it to use, the product inside was dirty, sticky, and stained with what looked like dried coffee. When I plugged in the "pre-charged" product, it didn't work. I brought it back immediately to the cashier who attended me and neither she nor the asst.mgr helped and said I couldn't return an open product. The cashiers there were rude and unprofessional.< /text>< Pictures>

Lowest price for fuel with propain as well. Owner and 3 employees have no humor or directions of area. Maybe in due time. Not friendly although fair prices on snacks slurpy.<//review>

< Review>
I showed up 15 minutes prior to my 1000 appointment time and was sent to a door immediately. The parking was a little tight with the trailers parked in front of the docks but it wasn't impossible and nobody seemed to struggle too much. About 30 minutes later I had a forklift driver knocking on my door to tell me I was finished and it was time to walk to shipping for my paperwork. I waited about 3 minutes for my bills to get printed and was rolling out of the gate. I don't understand why they get negative reviews but they were a very professional and friendly shipper. I would gladly take one of their loads again.</Review>

< Review>
AWFUL. I would leave 0 stars if I could. Ordered a coffee maker December 2nd and still have yet to receive it, its currently December 28th. I called the company because the shipping number I was given did not work. It took them about 15 minutes on the phone to figure out that they had given me the wrong tracking number so they then gave me the "correct FedEx tracking number" well this number didn't work either so then it took them another 10 minutes to figure out that the package was being shipped through USPS and not FedEx. Unreal. I then explained to the woman on the phone that this is a Christmas present and that if it was not going to arrive in time then to go ahead and cancel my order and refund me my money...she reassured me several several times on the phone that it would arrive before Christmas. She explained that delivery takes 7-10 business days and that I ordered it 23 days before Christmas so I will "definitely have it in time" which was a lie. I emailed the company explaining the situation and how their employee had given me a guarantee it would arrive before Christmas, I gave them the exact date, time and person I spoke to on the phone because they "record" their calls and they gave me the most generic response ever that did not address any of the points that I had raised. They tried to use the excuse of weather, the package is coming from LA and being delivered in Phoenix, there was no bad weather during the month of December so that was a blatant lie which I kindly told them. They then tried to use the excuse of covid, which don't get me wrong I understand its messing with things but how are all these other companies able to get things delivered in a timely, it was just another lie and excuse to fall back on. The customer service has been absolutely awful, worse then awful. I wish I would of gone online and read the reviews on this shady company before purchasing a product from them. Please believe the reviews, this company is awful and soon as they have your money they don't give 2 craps about you. I have emailed customer support several more times and they cannot even tell me where my package is or the estimated delivery time. 0 help. I called them today trying to get an update as to where my package was so I can hurry up and send the POS back to them but yet again, they had no clue and couldn't help. At one point they told me to call USPS to try and figure it out....LOL. I cannot stress enough how awful this company is. Save yourself a lot of time and from a headache and buy from one of their competitors, I guarantee the customer service will be 100x better than that of this company. AWFUL AWFUL COMPANY. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM, THEY ARE A SCAM!!<//Review>

Not a good place to work at...if youre a unloader..its worse..the people who are are hired expect you to know what they know and do without FULLY explaining the process to you 1st and get instantly frustrated with you when you dont pick what theyve known for months in a few minutes..they then get mad and talk bad about you to the supervisors/managers...its all downhill from there.they(managers of recieving) wont give you a chance at all to learn once this happens..but will tell you you may get hired at 16 hr which doesnt happen...typical bad warehouse job where if you arent kissing arse to one employee...they go around and put you down.go somewhere else and avoid this uneccessary b.s.youve been warned!</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) not only is it not clear from which side it is right to enter there, because there was a queue on both sides of the road and everyone thought that only on their side of the road the check-in was correct, even if they put a sign. ...
very slowly, in the shipping office no one cares about you, no one works, they just look smartly at computers. terrible company terrible attitude towards drivers.

(Original)
мало того что не понятно с какой стороны правильно туда заезжать,потому что с обеих сторон дороги очередь была  и все думали что только с их стороны дороги заезд правильный.хоть бы знак какой поставили .так ещё ко всем ужасам этой жизни они и грузят отвратительно медленно.
очень медленно,в шипинг офисе всем нет до тебя дела,никто не работает ,только с умным видом пялятся в компьютеры. ужасная компания ужасное отношение к водителям.<//text><rating>1</rating>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Loading is very fast, about forty minutes. Waiting for paper is very slow. One and a half hours. Office women are very unprofessional.

The store is great in itself,  but too many Transients!  A few weeks ago a transient woman spit on our window after we asked her to stop trying to take out someone else's side mirror and today another Transient man was half naked talking all kinds of nonsense in front of the store for 25-30 minutes.... it's just sad!< /review>

DO NOT SHOP HERE, AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE! I bought a few items here and after the lady rang me up I looked at the receipt and figured out one of my items was 4.99. At this time I was still in the check out line. I told her I would like to return the item and she said her manager would as soon as she was done with her customer so I said ok. When the manager was done she told me she would not be able to return my money as the the cashier told me she would. Instead she offered store credit because it would take too long for the money to come back to my credit card. I said I was aware it would take while but it was ok she still persisted, so I had to leave and have my dad come in the store to speak to her. I never got my money back. And I will NEVER shop there again!<//review>

I like the store, clean and healthy products as well, I always buys bananas there and bread. I like their yogurt too when they have it. Prices are always good and it is conveniently located on Anaheim street, parking is good as well as the store hours.</Text>

Okay, it's a 99 Cents Only Store

And yet some items are $2.99, I saw one item for $4.99. Not like the good old days when absolutely everything in the store was 99 cents. Of course that's at all 99 Cents Only Stores, not just the one in Wilmington... And to be fair, some items are less than 99 cents. This is not one of your upscale 99 Cents Only Stores... (The ones with wine, at least 3 types of olive oil and a manager with a Pavillions attitude) But this one manages to cram a whole lot into a small space and the floor staff is forever straightening up the shelves and bins disrupted by the bargain hunters. There are to be sure, some strange products: Non Dairy Creamer that clearly states "Contains Milk" and Swedish Sardines from China. But to me, that's half the fun in going to the store in the first place: never knowing what I'm going to find. I have learned over the years that if I go to the 99 cent only store because I really truly need peanut butter then for certain, they will be out of peanut butter. On the other hand if I go in with a loosely drawn up list with no definitive needs, I'm likely to find almost everything I want. This store has a very Hands-On manager who is only too eager to help you and her staff has the same attitude. Even the security guards are pleasant which is a rare sight in Wilmington. So it's tiny store, the geraniums in front are sometimes wilted, the parking lot is crazed but it's still the best 99 Cent Only store in Wilmington. In fact, it's the only 99 Cents Only Store in Wilmington, despite many imitators.<//Review>

<gmapID>0x80d95371d02825b3:0xdc8977d126615ea4</gmapID>< Review>
Second try was worse. I’ll walk a block. EDIT: hello new staff! Friendly and helpful. I can now leave my bag in a safe spot. I understand that they don’t want someone wandering down the toy isle with a backpack (I worked retail too), they have a safe spot to store while in the store. I don’t expect vip treatment, but they deliver a neighborhood friendliness while my clothes are tumbling across the street at Jonnie and Ivy’s wash house. So happy to do laundry now. Perfect! I hope the kids at this store get their $15/hr soon.<//Review>

This dollar store in this Family Dollar Store if I call that they have all the same things so if I like these. They're nice and cheap and they have everything you copy want you got the baby like are we still going to buy a little bit of groceries a little bit of stuff to wash with the little cheaper than most stores we have several of them around San Diego but I like this one only went to one because the one that lives over here by me where they're at the painting it or spraying for bugs otherwise all I had to do is walk down Logan's Avenue and there it is. It looks a laundromat is< /review>

I love coming here, the prices are good and the app definitely helps you save. We have tried to avoid the big stores and rather go to smaller stores since it benefits us, in the last 2 weeks that we've gone in Lucero has helped us and she is awesome, she reminds us about using the app, she has great customer service and always asks how is your day going, She really makes you feel welcomed. We definitely need more people like her during these tough times.</review>

The cashier was being extremely disrespectful when she was checking me out and walked away when I tried to ask her a question. She kept rolling her eyes and wouldn’t answer me when I was talking to her. I also saw her yelling at a customer because he didn’t have the 9 cents that he was missing. I wish I could’ve gotten her name so she could get in trouble for this. I used to love coming to this store but I am most certainly not coming back to this store.< /text>

<review>I have gone several times to family dollar and I had the male older cashier call out the amount of cash I'm loading into my prepaid cards to the rest of the customers as well as people not following six feet apart guidelines every time I'm about to pay there's someone directly  behind or next to me, today I had a older female who seem friendly with the cashier wearing no mask walk and grab stuff from the register almost touching  my son cutting a line of 5 to six people very unprofessional that because you know people you give special preference before the rest of the customers specially during this pandemic time...< /review>< Date>

<Review>I like it here cause it has a variety of things. Anywhere from a microwave dinner to curtains. It has affordable prices for the variety of things and they also have a discount section where you can get things anywhere from up to half off. Great store and close to my home as well...

Like others have said, it's a Staples.   Their private label notebooks absolutely kick Moleskine in the teeth. Better paper, more pages, more sturdy.

Beyond the 'whatever, it's a Staples' mentality, what I will say is in a world that is increasingly easier to order on Amazon and be lazy, this place always always always has what I need.< /text>

I come to this Staples to get my business cards and some of the employees act prejudice. Particularly the employee by the name of Anthony. He is rude to black customers. My mom went to the store to get an email printed out and he told her that "they dont do that", which is apparently false because a female employee was able to help her out with this before.
My mom proceeded to look to buy a printer, and he began to watch her assuming that she was going to steal. Please do something regarding this behavior...</review>

<Review>This place has really gone down over the years. Went here to get a printer toner cartridge, and they didn’t have it in stock, and even their “in stock guarantee“ was not honored. Very inconvenient. Like I said, this has gone down a lot and probably needs new management. Just order it all online instead.  Don’t bother.  Sad decline.< /Review>< Rate>

Issac in the printing section should deserve a raise for his amazing customer service. I came in to print a blueprint as well as other important documents but I wasn't sure the size etc. He helped me figure it out and gave me some wonder advice.</Text>

<Review>It’s with deep and utter dismay in the level of customer services provided to me by your staples location 5407 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90036 on October 27th, ,2019 at approximately 2:30 to 3pm that I’ve contacted you today. During my visit to your store I brought some copies at your copy center. The self service copy machines were down at the time so each customer had to be assisted by staff.

I was assisted by a total of two associates and one person in management. Each person I spoke with sent me to another individual as if  each attendant didn’t have time to complete my order. Once received my order was incorrect and missing documents. Instead of full blown up pictures I received a 7x4 photos that barely takes about a quarter of the paper. I spoke with associates again assuring that this isn’t my entire order and dimensions are off I was met by distasteful remarks by management. With so many copies the courtesy of allowing me to see at least one document was not granted when I requested also! Also Regarding the quality of my pictures and the blatant lie that the picture can’t be blown up. These same pictures I’ve blown up on numerous occasions with no issue! In attempting to convey my statement i was met with laughter by your employees. Told I can come back in an hour for an express pick up. Which I didn’t have time for. I’m a licensed medical professional I needed these documents for a job presentation. For obvious reasons I didn’t have them by my deadline.

The ball was obviously dropped here I’m completely floored by the disposition of everyone at the print center. I’ve never received this level of nastiness in my previous visits, I feel discriminated against as a African American woman. Subjected to  laughing, staring, whispering, unsolicited comments, horrible attitudes all the while I’m paying to get treated this way?

Oh no!!! In order to have great customer service there needs to be an affinity for diversity and inclusion of all individuals no matter race,sex,religion,age, ethnicity! Maybe your employees would benefit greatly from cultural diversity and inclusion training.

Best Regards,
Mariah< /Review>< Pictures>

Ordered some prints online from staples. They looked terrible. The colors were completely wrong. They couldn't even get black right. There were visible lines from where the printer hiccupped.<//review>

Promised business cards for an event Saturday by 8pm. Called Saturday afternoon to confirm. Came to store at opening Sunday morning, job not started. Called Sunday afternoon on hold 15 minutes to finally be told job not started. 45 minutes before closing I am sitting here watching them print and cut cards. Am I the manager? Why do I need to stand over you to make sure you do your job? The employees are terrible but it starts with leadership from above which is clearly nonexistent.<//Text>

<Text>Worst establishment in LA. Don’t visit, the managers are unprofessional and the store is a total disaster. Inside is very dirty, they try to up-sell you on every product, their employees stand around on their cell phones and seem annoyed when I ask for help. What a mess.<//Text>< pictures>

I went for my TSA precheck appointment on Saturday in the late afternoon. I just got my approval today on Tuesday- yay! I'm only knocking off a star because there was one person doing these interviews and they were running 30 minutes late. The process itself is easy.. you verify the application info, get your picture taken, get your fingerprints scanned and pay. You just go to the back of the store and sit in the Staples office chairs.. there's no check in, you just wait until your name is called.</text>

Regular Staples for your office supplies. There are fewer copiers and computers that are available for use by their customers  compared to Fedex. However, i would pick this location if you need to use mail merge to print letters, etc. by yourself. Print quality is great. Staff are helpful, responsive and has smiles on thier faces. Staples has its own parking lot which is a premium in this area and this is accessible to public transportation.<//text>

The staff was so friendly so I really want to give 5 stars, but the selection is lacking and I wasn't able to find what I was looking for. If you are looking for a commonplace item though, this is definitely where you should go.</Review>

Wow! Just wow, the level of customer service and attention to detail the Production Supervisor ANA gives is nothing short of amazing. It's unfortunate she doesn't have much support being the primary go to person every time other employees didn't know what to do, we're stuck or simply lost and needed guidance. Under all that pressure she managed to be calm and collective. I usually don't give reviews but I was amazed on how efficient she was and how well she conducted her self under pressure. I will always ask specifically for her on my future visits to staples. Ana you are a rockstar!!<//review>

EDIT: After my initial 4-star review things have changed. I'll spare you most of the details, but leave you with some words of caution: If you're not into paying extra for their in-house warranty, you better hope your electronics break in under 14 days. Otherwise you'll be left with a $150 doorstop. Do yourself a favor and buy from Amazon or somewhere where you have a chance of support (or a return/exchange) if you need it.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Overall not a fan of these huge office supply stores, just something about the overall vibe is a bummer, but they do serve a purpose. Needed to replace our printer on the quick and they had a nice selection of printers, with some good sale prices. The biggest surprise was the service, however. Knowledgeable and helpful, and aside from the nonsense of having to try to sell us a $40 protection plan on a $99 printer, they got us sorted quickly and with a smile.< /text>

I always purchase my HP toner cartridges at this Staples location. My color cartridge ran out today and I opened my new, unused one. It had a crack and was oozing ink. I opened a second new one and inserted it into my printer ... color not correct at all ... mostly blues and grays.

I then called the store to discuss the matter and was told that there is NOTHING they can do about it because it has been more than 14 days since my purchase. I was astounded! Thus, I am now out $110 for 2 faulty cartridges.

Oh, if I return them, I can get a $2 credit for each one ...

Verrry disappointed in their business policies.<//text>

<review>I went in today to get my Iphone SE battery replaced at 2pm. The first employee tells me to come back at 3pm since the person that does repairs won't be there until then. I then return an hour later and they say they have the battery and then continue to make me do the paperwork to allow them to work on my phone (which takes about 15 minutes). So now I go to wait and sit in my car while they work on my phone. I waited for 30 minutes before I come back inside only to find out that they used the wrong battery and don't even have the CORRECT battery that my Iphone SE uses..... Staples website says they replace this phone and the website also said this location had my battery!!!! So in all I wasted a few hours of my Saturday off to make multiple trips to Staples just to have the exact same battery put back into my phone....oh and now Staples has ALL the personal information I had to give them to work on the phone and now most likely going to sell my information off to the highest bidder.... What also pissed me off was how on the receipt, THE SKU FOR THE BATTERY CLEARLY DIDN'T SAY IPHONE SE, so this is either incompetence or clear lack of not caring for the customer!

Staples you have lost me FOREVER as a customer and I hope Amazon puts you out of business< /review><username>Graham Jimerson</username>< Rating>

Worst Experience ever the Employees need to be train and get some commences,  I when in there for some envelopes and some pens something that would take 5-10min  but i guess not at this location took me more like 45min. First ask for help with the envelopes took 15min to get help and no they did not come and help me i had to go look for them that's some BULL , So the young lady comes and try to help me yes TRY she took the info and never Came Back very unprofessional and there i go again looking for her to try to get and answer if they have them or not but at the end she said we have them but they are unloading them Stupid Answer she have me she could of just said we are out. And for the pens that a nother 25min to try to get them cause the worker are Really STUPID yes ..</review>

The girls where I send my stuff didn’t even want to help me out and when I would ask questions on how to do things they looked at me like I was crazy like you’re hired there for a reason to help people out and be polite and they weren’t none of those and one of them was like I need to clock out so she’ll help you and she was still there and another customer comes in and she helps them and I’m still waiting like WTF SERIOUSLY I WAS WAITING THERE FOR AN HOUR THESE WORKERS SUCK< /text>

Friendly helpful staff (a staples rarity) but the store is exceptionally disorganized, all the signs telling you what is on which aisle are for the most part incorrect. If you have the time to hunt down your office supply, this works.<//text>

Wait 20 minutes on the phone for them to tell you they don't know if your order came in. Worst service anywhere. Shop amazon< /review>

Horrible customer service. Waited 10 min to get a hold of an associate. When I did I was put on hold for another 10 min and had to call again. The second associate I spoke with was unapologetic and when I asked not to be on hold was automatically put on hold.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) They do not give good service on the internet. Decide that in this store there was the product that I was looking for and I reached the address that I said was available and they say that they do not have it, I think they should not do that because one is confident that what you are looking for is and they come out with that ... Bad service .....

(Original)
No dan buen servicio en internet decida que en esta tienda habia el producto que yo buscaba y llegue a la direccion que decia que estaba disponible y dicen que no lo tienen, pienso que no deven hacer eso porque uno va confiado de que esta lo que buscas y salen con eso... Mal servicio.....</text>

I came in back in May when I was having an allergic reaction to lobster. Everybody was very patient and they took care of me in no time. The doctor was very kind and he examined me thoroughly. I also love the front desk person. I would definitely come here again.< /Review>

<text>I had a great experience here.When I came in,I had to fill out two forms, got seated, paid my co-pay, and waited for not more than 10 minutes before being called in to be assessed. Note, this was at 6:30 PM on a weekday. Doctor saw me within 10 minutes of waiting in a room; got my x-ray done there and then, waited another 5 minutes for the doc’s evaluation and out I was.  Keep up the good job!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

< review>
Staff was AMAZING!!  The Dr thought that my ankle may have been broken due to swelling and discoloration but I was having more pain in my leg just beneath my knee. He was only going to order X-rays of my ankle but he ACTUALLY LISTENED to me and agreed to also do my leg. Then, he made the comment that he was “humbled “ that my ankle was fine but my fibula was fractured just below the knee. I was in and out in under an hour after being seen, had X-rays, AND splinted. It’s VERY rare for a Dr to admit a fault. I DEFINITELY would recommend this facility for care.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Arrived shortly after opening. I we were 2nd to arrive. This was our first time at this urgent care so we did have to fill out the appropriate paperwork. Relatively short wait time. When we were seen it was extremely quick. We were in to check my 2yr olds eye to make sure it was a scratch and not pink eye. Very happy with how quickly we were seen, the level of care and the over all friendly atmosphere.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>This is the second visit at accelerated urgent care for our family. The first for myself. It was refreshing to be able to get in so quickly and be seen at an urgent care that did not take the entire day! Not only were they efficient they were CLEAN! Hands-down, way important this day in age esp! The staff is excellent, I will return if need be, not that I want there to be a need to be, but should it arise, I know myself and family will receive 5 star service.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1620414805498, 'text': 'Thank you for your wonderful feedback, and thank you for choosing Accelerated Urgent Care.\n\nTeam AUC'}< /response>< gmapID>

Highly recommend Accelerated Urgent Care. This was the cleanest urgent care I’ve ever been to. The office was beautiful and the staff was amazing from the front office staff to the back office and doctor. They got me in and out quickly, very attentive and friendly.< /review>

<Text>Amazing urgent care! The doctor and staff were so helpful and genuinely cared about our situation. Awesome experience here, unlike most urgent cares. My boyfriend had an extreme tooth abscess causing severe pain and they were able to give him medications while we wait to get into a dentist! Thank you so much for the treatment:)< /Text>< Date>

<Text>Mike you're handling of my ingrown nail removal was atrocious. I worked as a Medical Assistant for some time and granted it is not as trained/specialized as Nurse. However, I have had enough procedures done to me and by me to know you NEVER inject a patient with such force as you did my foot. In addition when I expressed I could still feel pain even after you let your Lidocaine injection have time to work. You ignored my plea as you started digging and cutting it out. I FELT EVERYTHING! I have had my full toenail removed before and felt nothing because the doctor who treated me knew what they were doing and made sure I was painless BEFORE STARTING THE PROCEDURE! Not only was your incompetence completely present but the lack of empathy for your patient was on full display. Your exact words after it was done was "Imagine what it would have felt like if I had used no Lidocaine" You pompous donkeys rear-end! I choose this facility because it had good reviews. You have shamed the medical community with your blatant disregard of our oath to not cause harm with our hands but to heal with them.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dc83bff01ceaad:0x199b8bab2bfb052d< /gmapID><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1625082050871, 'text': 'We want to sincerely apologize to you for your poor experience.

Big red flag was the nurse practitioner pushing pain pills. Despite me telling him I wasn’t in pain he kept insisting I get some for “in case the pain returns” but I reminded him that he told me to go to the emergency room if the pain returns, he then fumbled his words. Offered them to me three times before quickly leaving and wanting nothing more to do with me, also the clinic doesn’t perform many tests due to their small size and scale. Other than that, clean and kind staff just don’t hire or trust the pill pushing quack.<//Text>

The wait time was very short and the doctor showed empathy and clearly described his diagnosis. He even gave me two possible treatments depending on how much pain I was in. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a doctor who truly cared and took his time diagnosing my symptoms. Will be coming again!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This is by far the best urgent care in town . The girls in the front are super friendly, knowledgeable, and quick to get you checked in . Michelle in the front is always helpful , always greats us with a big smile , and is very personable. I have been to this urgent care for covid testing , a back injury , and a busted nose . The dr has been accurate each time with the diagnosis and treatment. I truly appreciate you guys ! This urgent care treats you like a CUSTOMER not a patient I highly recommend.<//Review>

They were thorough and did great work.  Got me treated and on my way in no time at all.  Nice to know this place is close and trustworthy.  The office was clean and everyone was professional.  Thank you.<//Text>< Pictures>

I took my son in for a rapid covid test ten days ago and had a great experience and really liked the Doctor.  I scheduled a follow up to his positive test and had a 12:15 appointment.  We got there early and I told them we had an appointment when I signed him in.  About 45 minutes later I checked back in because they still had not charged me my copay.  She told me they would call me up when ready.  An hour later...still sitting there...and we had a friend come in.  We chatted awhile and then he went in.  As he came out I asked him what time his appointment was.  He was a walk in.  So we sat there for two hours with an appointment, that I had to stay up until midnight to book, as walk-ins came in and out in 30 mins.  Also both times I was there, one of the receptionists just chose to wear her mask as convenient to her.  If she has a health reason not to...which is a very small percentage then don't bother.  If she doesn't then she should have that thing on not dangling under her chin or on her desk somewhere.  Trust me I had a lot of time to watch this over two visits.  Get your front of house staff together and this will be an excellent place.  I will try it again hopefully they will be more organized and professional.</text>

I did get lucky when I went on a Sunday for the first time! The second time I went I scheduled an appointment online. My appointment was at 9:45, I arrived at 8:00 am and there was a line around the corner!! Again, they took me in early greeted me nicely and this nurse was even MORE amazing than the first.

<review>Accelerated Urgent Care in Wildomar is the WORST urgent care I have ever been to.  I will never return.  I went there for a COVID-19 test.  I was told the wait would be an hour.  After an hour and a half, I asked if they had an estimate for how much longer it would be.  They told me I am next and had me a copay (which should not have been required for a COVID test).  I paid anyway and was told to wait in the lobby for them to call my name.  After 20 more minutes, I asked how much longer I would have to wait.  I was told, there were four people ahead of me and the wait would be another hour.  Unreal!!!   It took less than an hour to test at the Murrieta site; and there were more people in line.</review><pics>None</pics>< gmap_id>

Injured my thumb pretty badly and very painful. Walked in, only waited about 5 minutes to be seen. Doc came in did his thing, ordered meds and I was on way home in 10 minutes. Front office friendly and professional.<//Review>

I am fairly off put by many urgent care facilities. Accelerated is clean, warm, inviting, and they don’t waste time. You won’t be sitting in their lobby for hours! They also give you the option to wait in your car if you don’t want to be exposed to extra germies! They’ll call you or flag you down when it’s your turn to come in! They take most insurances, including Tricare which is also a bonus! My family really enjoys the Wildomar team. We’ll be coming back for sure! Ps- Miss Kiwi was so good to my six year old! What a gem, she was lovely!</Review>< Pics>

Showed up with my five year old covered in hives and swollen lips and was told “we do t take Blueshield HMO.” Just a heads up to check before you go to get URGENT care that they are selective about who they see.</Review>

<text>Everything is an A+++, front office staff, initial consultation, doc visit, etc etc.  My only concern is the waiting room, for the obvious reason of the virus.  But one can wait outside and the front office will call you on your cell phone.  Thanks to all of you there at the Wildomar office for everything that you all are doing to help the community.<//text>< Pics>

Dr Philips was kind however, she had us waiting in her office for 40 minutes. My Fiancé was in extreme back pain which made the wait time seem like an eternity. The doctor sent us home with instructions to pick up a prescription to help with the muscle spasms. We arrived to the pharmacy only to find the prescription was never sent. We called the office and was told the doctor forgot to send it. The office staff assured us the prescription would be sent within the hour. This was noon on Saturday. 5:00 pm came around and the pharmacy still had not received the prescription. We called the doctor again with no luck reaching anyone. The office closed at 5:00pm. We had to wait 2 days to receive the medication we so desperately needed to help with the agonizing spasms. Horrible experience! We will not be returning to this facility for urgent care again.< /Review>

The worst urgent care ever. They tell you to complete the telemed online and someone will call you shortly. Two days later and a promise from a staff she will call you back and nothing.  So, we go to the urgent care as my son cannot breathe and she said they will be waiting for him only to tell him 30-60 minutes later that it will be another 45 minutes.<//Review>

Drove from Moreno valley to pick up this 25 piece set that was out of stock at all the other stores near me. Took the chance and went. Spoke with the operator and she was a sweetheart in helping me make sure it was in stock. Left with more than I was expecting. Great prices and deals.<//Text>

Went looking for That 70 show complete series  I could not find it. But an associate, his name was Terry, went out of his way to find my dvds. We really appreciated it, very few would take the time to look through dvds to find what a customer is looking for. We need more like Terry in this world.< /Text>

Convenient....close to home in Upland. However, so many items are under lock & key, which requires assistance from staff to unlock cabinets and put items in a secure area until ready for checkout. :-(<//review>

This store definitely changed over the years. Now with the self checkout area, shopping has become a breeze. Get in get out be done. Facility is clean and organized. Staff are friendly.< /Review>

Usually, it's a pretty good store. The people working there are helpful, and are knowledgeable about the items in store. As usual, they have very good deals on many things, with items usually being cheaper than most other stores. I have only had one bad experience, and that was today, where I waited for almost 20 minutes to get a videogame.<//review>

This location was clean and well stocked. The staff was friendly and helpful. The store is easy to shop and it wasn't too busy the morning that I visited. I went in for one thing and I found some great deals I couldn't pass on.< /text>

The reason I give 3 stars is because I don't like the store policy, as to some items not being allowed to be place in my basket or having to be taken to the counter by an store associate.
I'm not a thief and I don't want to be treated as one.

Overall the store is decent.<//Text>

<Review>How was Walmart? Really? Just as expected, they had two out of 7 super common items I needed, employees are useless, and everything is locked up requiring a useless uninterested employee to help you.  Good luck, pay more, shop small business!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<review>Went to Walmart to cash a check. The money center there is awful. Long wait, often they find a reason to refuse honoring the check. Then I take the same check to a bank or a check cashing business and it's not a problem at all. Would not recommend Walmart at all.</review><Resp>None<//Resp><user_name>Mikey Mayhem<//user_name><Time>1619158448058<//Time>< Rate>

<Review>Terrible. No one was in the garden center to help. Counters closed.  I wanted to buy several large plants but would have had to drag them to the other end of the store. Couldn't find anyone to help. I was told they were very short staffed. Only purchased 3 small plants that I could carry. They had items I wanted but I could not.< /Review></record>

Kind of a pain to shop at because of theft, things are locked up and it is a hassle to wait for associates to unlock what you need and then they take it up to the front. Is a pain if you need different things in different departments that are locked up. I hate it. No one ever came to unlock a nintendo switch game for us and no one was in electronics. After 45 minutes of trying to get someone we left and went to BestBuy and price matched where things aren't as locked up.< /text>

<review>Self check out is great! But when you need locked items it takes a while for an employee to come and open and get what you need. I was in the beauty isle and it took someone 25 minutes to come and help.</review>< Pictures>

Customer service is horrible. Loss prevention doesnt prevent the loss of anything including my patience. Ill never go back. This business needs to be shut down. The homeless bums thaf surround the building living by it do more work for the business then the staff.  Shame</review>

Went to buy totes for storage. Most of what they had was mismatched and broken. We had only one employee say here let me help you as he rolled his eyes when my husband and I were not fast enough to get out of his way while in the isle. After "his help" he left abruptly. And for the rest of the trip employees actively ignored us. What fun huh?...< /Text>

Worst Walmart. I placed a photo order and did not realize it wouldn’t be ready for 7 days but I decided just to be patient because I try to be understanding because of Covid. 9 days later my order has been delayed for 3 days. I went to the store and no one knows anything about photo and it is always just someone covering. I went back to the store and no one can even find my order number to give me any information. I have waited 6 more days and still nothing. Call the store? No one answers ever. I go online to cancel and it gives me no option other than to return after I get my order. But how do I cancel if I never get my pictures???? Ridiculous. If you can’t run a photo lab Walmart! Don’t have one!!!!!< /review>

Many products are locked behind glass, including all hygienic and personal care products. You have to wait for someone to come unlock it, and they don't give you the item. They take it to the front and when you check out you have to find someone to get the product from another safe at the front. This Walmart is always crowded and parking is laborious.< /Review>

I was able to do a return from an online order. And I did find a few other items I was looking for.. if you want a bigger selection of grocery items you're going to have to go to the Super Walmart.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><userid>116626582244416393319<//userid>< Name>

<text>I have been to this Walmart twice and both times I have had terrible experience ranging from a dirty and messy store, to a staff that seems to be inconvenienced when you ask them for help. I even had one argue with me that I was not using the Walmart app and that is why I was wrong, even after I showed them the app icon labeled Walmart. I would not recommend this Walmart to anyone.< /text>< pics>

<text>After Covid cleanliness has increased tremendously.  Well organized, helpful, smart staff.  Just wish our economy would rebound so the shelves are fully stocked.  Check with the store before driving there...it may not be available.  Especially, toys, electronics, etc.  Other essential stuff fully available!  Love the self checkout system  too!  Thanks Walmart!  Way better than Amazon!< /text><UserId.>110825884053135734354</UserId.><name>N DeSilva< /name><Response>None< /Response><date>1596747028814</date><Rate>5<//Rate>< GmapID>

It's a Walmart.  Nothing out of the ordinary. The reason why I give 5 stars, is its pretty much a one stop shop.  Got ink for my printer, firewood, baby wipes, mascara & a worthy kind of bathing suit.  Your place to go for the random shopping list.<//text>

Went before work (8am on a weekday) to quickly pick up a needed item (phone case) and got in and out fairly quick after having to ascert myself to the only clerk working in electronics who was too busy chatting while watching me stand waiting for her. But after, I was out of there fast.</text>

<Review>The instructions for pickup do not work.  The email I received had a button to check in, but it only sent me to the website where there were no directions for checking.

Walmart is walmart. What can I say. They had an item that I needed in stock, which was not available at my local Walmart store. Hence the reason why I traveled this far, to this store. Otherwise it is nothing to write home about. It is NOT a supercenter. And it looks and feels cramped and dingy inside the store.</Text>

I got a great deal on tires with Walmart.com with their Black Friday deals. There was a small issue with the appointment set up at the store for instalation, but the staff their at the Upland Walmart service center made it right.</Review>

I came here a few days ago to get Delectable Stews for my cats. This store has a good selection at a reasonable price. I saw there were also some plastic  cat bowls that are the size and height that I prefer. I bought 2, then today I went back to get the other two colors.  I'm getting them to replace the ceramic bowls which tend to chip and break.<//Text>

Its walmart, but this is  smaller one and older one, also not as busy. But its strange some items (Slime sealant) require the workers to walk up the item to cash register, its as big as shampoo bottle and cost about the same, why thr heightened security, just wanted to fix vike tire asap. But waiting for a worker to help took a while then the later at check out. Kinda overdone for Slime.<//text>

Well, I rarely rate a place with one star because they’re just not worth the effort but out of the four Walmart’s I’ve had car service, this one tops the lowest (pun) in customer service.  I got my tires done which was fine but I had to wait, along with four other customers in line behind me for 32 minutes... yes... THIRTY TWO minutes IN LINE (this was after waiting for my car to be serviced which I expected) and after they said my car was ready!

A customer was in front of me getting her battery replaced (after only six months and it died- this is why you don’t buy batteries at Walmart- they’re the .99 cent store batteries for cars-unreliable ), the clerk, the only clerk working the counter, had no clue how to do a battery exchange.  She had to go outside to the customer’s car, come back in, go to the battery section, bring the battery to the counter then still had no clue how to do that exchange.

Not her fault but Walmart’s lack of training.

Meanwhile, the phone was ringing and ringing (so if you were calling this Walmart’s auto dept, they ignored you.)

Then another experience clerk came and did a little better (meanwhile, the line behind me was growing with impatient customers ... then what looked like the auto sept manager (in blue shirt) came out and finished the exchange.  He never apologized to the customers waiting, never acknowledged us or even called for backups.

I was going to come back for my other set of tires and a set for my daughter’s car but.... yeah, won’t happen.<//review>

< Review>
Its walmart, but this is  smaller one and older one, also not as busy. But its strange some items (Slime sealant) require the workers to walk up the item to cash register, its as big as shampoo bottle and cost about the same, why thr heightened security, just wanted to fix vike tire asap. But waiting for a worker to help took a while then the later at check out. Kinda overdone for Slime.<//Review>

< Review>
Walmart stores are going down hill, so many items are locked up you have to find someone to get that item for you the item maybe less than $3 lock behind plastic doors. The  checkout lines are very very slow, if you purchase something they have is lockup they'll take it to a cash register and you have to check out there. if you have other items to purchase, do it first then get your item and check out I hope you have a lot of time for this type of shopping. They may have a lot of theft at the stores but that show your security isn't doing their job so then go ahead and inconvenience the customer. Where is corporate when you need them. Notice the broken glass by the security cameras.

<Review>I came here a few days ago to get Delectable Stews for my cats. This store has a good selection at a reasonable price. I saw there were also some plastic  cat bowls that are the size and height that I prefer. I bought 2, then today I went back to get the other two colors.  I'm getting them to replace the ceramic bowls which tend to chip and break.< /Review><user_name>Yvette Hutton< /user_name>< user>

I usually go to Glendora but this Walmart had a product I wanted, unfortunately the self check out was dirty and full of hair on the scanner. I told the employee and he said there were only two of them. We are in a pandemic and all stores are working hard to keep place clean. Please I was so disguised I wanted to just leave without buying<//Review>

Store associate rolled her eyes at us for not having a bag of ice in our cart during checkout. We always grab the ice on the way out. The price rang up wrong and she was upset that we didn't already have it in our cart. The ice was on the other side of the registers.<//text>

The store is always well stocked. I usually get in and out during my lunch if I need to go. Please get rid of solicitors and people taking polls outside. Also, pressure wash the outside sometimes. Nothing like a clean walkway to greet you.<//Review>

Walmart stores are going down hill, so many items are locked up you have to find someone to get that item for you the item maybe less than $3 lock behind plastic doors. The  checkout lines are very very slow, if you purchase something they have is lockup they'll take it to a cash register and you have to check out there. if you have other items to purchase, do it first then get your item and check out I hope you have a lot of time for this type of shopping. They may have a lot of theft at the stores but that show your security isn't doing their job so then go ahead and inconvenience the customer. Where is corporate when you need them. Notice the broken glass by the security cameras.

<Text>well my concern is about much of the customers on Wal-Mart is that there so unreasonable,they don't respect follow any rules,neither the cashier's workers,i'm very disappointed,I did talk to the manager of Upland Ca,Wal-Mart an fothill,he said that there's anything to do,this means customers can do anything they will like to do?!
about elders covid19 like me care,protection?
and not only elders all ages of people?
one of the cashier's that I will paying it,practically said that they can make lines without the distances are required that we have to respect and follow?
to care for each other,well in this Wal-Mart they have any protections and care for others,i'm not fell save and protected!!
and so bad the way the cashier,manager responded back to me! I hope you can work on this and something much better!? 😔😔< /Text>< UserId.>

<Review>I like Walmart because they like me to have a good amount of money of theirs with the Walmart card they have given me; I dislike going to Walmart sometimes because the voting people are outside sometimes, and when they are, traffic seems un-organized like an invasion of privacy: it also makes things uncomfortable;< /Review><time>1602899899984</time><rating>5</rating><GmapID>0x80c3310d60ce4b2b:0x86f2dde64d64b921<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Just another California Walmart. They offer Money order/Cashier's check processing. Rest items are good. They carry limited Fresh produce like Banana, Onions, Potatoes & Avacado. They have plenty Self checkout counters & Staff is Friendly.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>This Walmart location truly deserves its five star rating. During my visit I was met with nothing but great customer service and presentation. The store was busy with plenty of customers but there was no long lines. Most customers at checkout were calm and patient which I can only guess means they were enjoying their time also. As far as the stores presentation goes everything was in place well presented and organized. I have to say great job to the management here and all of the stores crew. Being a Walmart store manager in the past I know what it takes and this store has it. Great Job!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Probably the last time we visit this store. Didnt have what we went for,  a woman was offering her basket to others asking for tips, surprised only self check outs were open and some guy on motorcycle was blaring music as we stepped out of store and not in a good way. Always a bit of an adventure going to Walmart but this time I think will be our last.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><user_name>Cathy Davidson< /user_name>< Rating>

Not a grocery store or "super" Walmart, but carries lots of groceries at great prices. The exception is the limited selection produce, however, which is overpriced in my opinion, simply because this location is not a grocery or super Walmart, as mentioned above. So I don't usually buy any produce here. Employees are top-notch, almost always helpful and friendly.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>I shopped here a couple of days ago and realized when I looked at the receipt that night that I was charged twice for a pair of shorts for one of my grandsons. I called the following morning and spoke to Mary, Customer Service Manager, who said to bring in the receipt, which I did today. The gentleman handled my credit very nicely. The only reason for the four stars is because the bathroom wasn't very clean and some items were in the aisle on the floor in the detergent aisle. I also very much dislike that you have to pay for cosmetics in that section even if you have other items to purchase. They need to increase their security instead of inconveniencing the customer.< /review>< rating>

Everything is locked up from hand cleaners to to combs, when you actually find someone to come unlock the glass you can't just sit there and compare products. This is of course after a 20min wait to get someone to open the case.. probably due to everything being behind lock and key. Then you have to go to a register or self checkout and ask for the product you're trying to buy. The isles are always blocked due to large wheeled carts because they constantly stock items during prime shopping hours. Service is always busy talking to someone about what they did 2 nights ago. Once all your shopping is done and you finally check out after they locate the products you wanted from behind the glass, you have to wait in another line so that they can scan your receipt and 1 item from your bag or cart.

The store is super inconvenient, expect to at least be there for an hour buying 1 thing. The store is dirty, there is a 75% chance you're gonna get a cart that is hard to push and wants to go everywhere but strait, if you have a store brand product that fails (it will) you'll have to have your receipt even for a replacement.</review>

Double paid for a $1.50 can of shaving cream because they lock it up with the cosmetics. Also if you need batteries they keep those locked up. How about just get better security because it's no longer convenient to shop here. Target here I come</Text>

DOWNHILL. Everything is locked up. No returns without receipt even if it's a Walmart brand product.  Really.... where else would i get it from? Need usb cables? Locked up.  Need car light bulbs? Locked up.  Need condoms? Locked up. What should've been a 30 min visit turned into an hour of waiting on employees to open the cases. Also, the only reason I'm returning the cable is because the walmart employee gave me the wrong one..
That's right.... i was not allowed to grab it from the case.  Employee grabbed the wrong one for me. Thanks.

Save yourself the trouble and go anywhere else possible.  Target is a good choice.

They told me to call the 1800 number for further concerns.  Amazing.  This place is trash.<//Text>

<Review>Wow, they have changed things around a lot since the last time was at this Wal-Mart on Foothill & Benson in Upland. One way "gate" at entry to prevent existing out the "Entry" doors. Still like the selection of products, and their prices. Wal-Mart is my "go-to" place for most things. I like the fact that unless there's a special sale, I can usually find the products I'm out looking for.<//Review><Date>1579507492213</Date><user_name>Mark Shibukawa</user_name>< pics>

They told me to call the 1800 number for further concerns.  Amazing.  This place is trash.<//Text><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

Worst customer service I've ever seen and been through, so bad I'm filing a verbal and written complaint to Walmart against Leilani, Patricia and Curry who work the front area as people are coming in and going out.  We got it all on camera including the stare down while driving out the parking lot by Curry.  Will never shop there again.<//Text>

You have to pay for everything in separate area. So if you don't carry cash you're running your card multiple times. None of the staff is friendly they give you eye rolls when you ask for help. I'd rather pay the dollar or 2 extra to shop at Target for stuff where the staff is friendly and not every single thing is locked up!< /text>< pics>

<Text>A very nice well-kept store that has pretty much everything you could want or need. Everything from automotive and small appliances to every item you need for daily living to include clothing and a wide variety of food. The staff is quite friendly and very helpful. The store is always busy but there is always someone that you can find to assist you with locating that one item that you can't seem to find on your own. I highly recommend that store and every other Walmart store and Neighborhood Market that are springing up throughout the country because they truly have some of the best prices best staff and the widest variety of everything.<//Text>< pics>

It was cheap, too poorly made, did not cut true, junk. They took it back no problem.

I enjoy having Walmart in our community,  but I just dislike that we ALWAYS NEED TO SHOW OUR RECEIPT each time.
I miss Chad our Manager off of Mountain in Ontario, Ca. He always had a sincere smile and always called me by my name each time I visit the Super Walmart. BRING HIM BACK. ;)</Text>

<review>Went in through the garden dept. where I said"Hello" to the Greeter who said nothing, didn't bother looking up from his phone! Rude! Pants also sagging down past his butt. So professional!!! This place is really going down hill fast. Too bad.< /review>< name>

It was cheap, too poorly made, did not cut true, junk. They took it back no problem.

This is the walmart to go to. Used to be pretty ghetto, but has improved since the super center went in. Less crowded.< /Review>

< Review>
Today, June 23,2017...had to wait in long line in garden area... One brave cashier, Matthew, called for help several times!  I was in my walker in severe pain,  parked in that area so not to walk further... I told the customers behind me to call Walmart!  I spoke to Candy... Told her of situation... Do not know how much longer it took to get help for the 10 plus customers behind me... I was able to finally get to store due to a sister in the LORD!  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME CUSTOMERS HAVE TO WAIT WHEN SO MANY LANES AVAILABLE BUT NO CASHIERS!!  YOUR SCHEDULE PERSON NEEDS TO LEARN... I WAS THERE... I HAVE HIRED, TRAINED, FIRED, SCHEDULED ETC... CUSTOMERS ARE YOUR LIFE BLOOD!!!  THANK YOU AND GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS YOU,  ESPECIALLY THAT YOUNG CASHIER, MATTHEW!!!!!< /Review>

This location should be turned into a Walmart Neighborhood Market cuz it ain't cutting it as a Walmart store. The flow of their grocery area makes absolutely zero sense and if it is warm outside then it is super hot inside as well.< /Review>

It's Walmart. I know why, but still boggles the mind that more and more things are locked behind glass.  I now prefer Target even if I pay a bit more for things that are locked at Walmart.< /text>

<review>I ordered a Christmas gift for my daughter and I was suppose to pick it up at this store. Instead they "processed" my package for a week, never notified me it was ready to be picked up, claimed they didn't know where it was when I went in person, and then sent it back. When I contact costumer service all they said was I'm sorry. Walmart thinks they can do whatever they want because they have low prices. Well, they can't and I refuse to support them. There's other businesses with better customer service and ethics.</review><Resp>None</Resp><user_name>Zatanna K<//user_name><user>104503852455819798820< /user></record>

We all felt relieved that they were getting help... he made her stop the transaction she wad working on and leave and go to help customer service?! And leaves everyone there waiting EVEN LONGER.

<Text>Cheap prices poor quality of customer service. Update* Gilbert the Assistant manager is awesome.

Cheap prices poor quality of customer service. Update* Gilbert the Assistant manager is awesome. He helped me find a outdoors item after the outdoor area was closed and then called over the speaker to tell me he found more if I wanted them too. Awesome job Gilbert. 5 stars for you.</Review>

Prices were great, but there was NO ONE to check me out. There were at least 15 people waiting at checkout with 1 cashier,  but lots of managers standing around talking to each other. Finally, after about 15 minutes they eventually opened one more register. Not going back any time soon.< /Text>

Stopped in to pick up some noise reduction ear muffs for the drag races got a pretty good deal on it really nice pair for $9.95. Also picked up a nice t-shirt and a 12 pack of Stella Artois cans. I was looking for a California t-shirt but they didn't have any there.</Review>

<text>I ordered a Christmas gift for my daughter and I was suppose to pick it up at this store. Instead they "processed" my package for a week, never notified me it was ready to be picked up, claimed they didn't know where it was when I went in person, and then sent it back. When I contact costumer service all they said was I'm sorry. Walmart thinks they can do whatever they want because they have low prices. Well, they can't and I refuse to support them. There's other businesses with better customer service and ethics.< /text>< name>

I can't believe the Upland store is nice and organize. I never wanted to go at the doing yourself Cash out, because I had a bad experience from the Lawndale store one. No one was there to help. Maybe they were short staff. I really don't know. That's so bad.<//review>

Im used to Wal Marts in Utah that are super centers and carry everything. I'm also not used to having to pay 10 cents for a grocery bag. I went to get cold medicine twice, the first time they charged me for a plastic reusable bag but the second time she just put it into a paper bag that didn't cost. Both times were for medicine and i feel should have been treated the same.< /review>

< review>
Well there's never much to say about Walmart stores. They're cheap and for a reason. Their customer service isn't the best that's for sure. Once, I called this place to get a price check on a bottle of Zombie mixer and they took 20 minutes to go check it even though the alcoholic beverage section is located near the registers. I live right down the road and could have driven there and back within 10 minutes to check the price myself. Their produce are WAY overpriced. Don't buy any fresh produce from them unless you want to pay $4 or $5 extra. They charge 69 cents PER LIME. At Cardenas grocery store, which is located down the street from this place sells them for 3 pounds for $1. Yeah that's how overpriced Walmart fresh produce are.
I have also seen a number of thefts right in front of me through the self-checkout registers and no one does anything. There isn't security guards watching at all. I have witnessed maybe 3 or 4 thefts and no one stops them.
If you are here to buy alcohol, prepare to wait 30 minutes for someone to go get the keys for the alcohol case. They are just very disorganized.< /review>

2 star  store. It's  sometimes when you need help. There's no employee in sight. Seems like they are hiding or playing where's Waldo. Always long lines there's like 3 cash register  are open. The rest is empty. The only good thing is self check out in this store. Though it's organized.  But one time I saw cockroach running out under shelf and a employee kicked it she  was terrified .  Clean I don't know. So it's okay store.< /text>

Walmart managers are very rude. To buy a Walmart card the employees send you on a wild goose chase just to buy one. Once we figured out where to go we stood in line forever with only one employee working, others standing around. When I went to find a manager the employee put my autistic uncle at the end of the line because he is handicapped and slow to communicate, when all my uncle wanted to do was pick out a card .</text>

Another crappy store, it’s like they hire the dumbest people to work their.  Sending off in the wrong direction all the times or they just don’t know nothing. Smiles, helpfulness and gratitude that you have a job goes a long way!</text>

<Text>Car battery only lasted for 6 months.  Tried to charge it multiple times, cleaned battery terminals and replaced cables.  I went to this store to exchange it, but the "battery charger" is down (don't they sell battery chargers?) and they can't exchange it until the "parts" arrive several days from now.

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I've been coming to this Walmart for years. I know several of the employees. But this lame supposed service manager " Katie "  thinks she's all high and mighty lmao... So as a lot of customer may know Walmarts lame return policy changed, so if they cant bring up the transaction or u don't have the recipt your screwed, and treated like a criminal. Lmao yeah ok I dont need the stupid return but it's only right or fair if the product doesnt work to allow customers  to return. On top of that they dont tell customers that the policy changes untill you happen to have a product that doesnt work and cant return it without the recipt. 90% of the time as I'm leaving the store I thow my recipt away or even when I get home. My thing is that I was treated as a criminal, asked to leave the store just because I didnt agree with the policy. Most likely itll end up in a class act law suit. And the way Katie is with customers, she should be fired, acting all high class and smeaky.. Calling lost prevention as if I was going to do something. Lame. All I wanted was my money back. On top of that she said she was the top Manager for the store. Please....BTW as I was leaving Katie is not the manager of the store someone else is. So I'll be in tomorrow to talk to the real a manager about being treated as a criminal not as a customer..< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Well, lost prevention is at odds with legitimate cashier check customers; they don't care for up scale white folks with no contemporary bank affiliation - first refusing to honor the legitimate check! Why would a semi-affluent "white male" cash this suspicious paper outside of his posh TD Ameritrade leather cushion?!  Nevertheless, business & community devastating economic ethics betrayed the corporate & intrinsic disdain of white males, finally capitulating to the five dollar fee my humble check provided.< /review>< pictures>

Horrible location I've never seen such a bad walmart went in to get a $3 pair of gloves and they were locked in a cage which took 10 min to get an employee to open then the employee had to walk the item to the front so it could be checked out which took another 5 min 🤷‍♂️🙉<//review>

This Wal-Mart was remodeled at the beginning of the year. It is clean and well maintained. The checkers are efficient. Staff here most often will take you to an item you are looking for rather than just tell you where it is.<//review>

<Review>One of the employees was stocking the shelves, when she asked me if I was finding everything okay. I was not and asked for what I was looking for. She took me to the other side of the store where the product was located but then she proceeded to tell me about the product I was looking for was actually on sale saving me a couple of bucks. She was awesome unfortunately the cashier had absolutely no personality whatsoever barely said hi, but had absolutely nothing to say to me. She did say thank you when I left which I was surprised I thought she wasn't. The store was busy but the shelves were stocked the way they should be. The store was clean and other than the cashier everybody was friendly.< /Review>< resp>

This place lacks common courtesy!!!! I was on hold for an employee in Sporting Goods for 43mins!!!! Then called back to be placed on hold without anyone saying "PLEASE HOLD" for another 17mins!! I called back to speak with a manager & was placed AGAIN ON HOLD for 33mins MORE!!!! They have no respect</Review>

Home away from home. Depending on the hours staff are courteous and the store is neat and clean. The lines are pretty long, but the wait is entertaining. Downfall some of the customers are rude and disrespectful< /Text>

Great store. The only reason its not getting the 5th star is because this location is notorious for not opening more registers when it gets ridiculously busy. Then again they all do it for lack of hiring more cashiers or what not but other Wal-Mart's would get 3stars for it and this one still earns its high marks because its staff is friendly and knowledgeable of its merchandise when asked questions. Even when the questions asked may not be pertaining to an associates particular department.< /Text>

For only one question about  car sterios and multimedia, I have to wait morethan 20 minutes. 1 employee serving 6 inline. Each will take 5 to 20 minutes.
Very hard to get help from employees. Walmart should hire more. It can afford it.< /text>

<Text>One of the better Wal-Mart's to go to.  The line for returns are never too crazy and they typically have what I need when I need it. ALL  their systems need updating,  but that's a corporate level thing.  Otherwise good Wal-Mart. I always use self check out or back registers if it's not too crazy.<//Text><Time>1514020992406</Time>< Rating>

Walmart is not my favorite place to be and some are better than others.  This is not a very good one.  Dirty and rude employees.  But it's the only one around my house and sometimes you have to brave it.</review>

Customer service is non existent. Wait times at the auto center are unnecessarily long. This place is the worst I've ever been to. Waited 2 hours, with only 2 cars already being serviced ahead of me. After two hours they had skipped my car several times and hadn't even touched mine. This place sucks. Don't waste your time.< /text>

< Review>
I tried to call upland Walmart on the phone to ask about a product, and they left me on hold for 15min  then hung me up, I called back again they did the same thing,  called through the pharmacy  they answered right away!  Ask them to transfer me to cut omer service he did . After several rings they picked up.  Then I ask for a manager,  she said they don't have one there only assistant , so I asked to speak to her left on hold again for ever. This store is the only Walmart that has this problem ! So now I call target right away they answer and helped me what I needed,  so target stole Walmart customer!</Review>

<review>Online Store returns, easy right?  WRONG.   I purchased something online just for the sake of being able to return it to a store near me, this was NOT the case at all.   I tried to return the item back to the store, but the friendly representative named Jimmy, did try to help me to the best of her ability and was about to provide me with a refund, but she had to call her supervsir.  Then a supervisor came a long, I had no idea what her name was since she did not have a name tag so I could identify her, and stated that I would not be able to return the item for a refund, but that I could get an online store credit. I said that that was not acceptable for a $170.00 item.   The supervisor then said that she would need to speak with the manager, so instead of her bringing him over to speak about the issue, they literally left everyone waiting in line as the poor guest representative was forced to wait since she could not log onto another register, and she was literally the only one working.    The supervisor then came back and told me that I was unable to return the item back for a refund at all.  I told her that it was ridiculous and not acceptable.   I then went home and called another store to see what there take was on this, they took the item back with no problem and said that the store should have taken it back with no issue.     I will NEVER be shopping at this Walmart again as this was the most ridiculous store return I have ever dealt with LITERALLY.    I appreciate Jimmy, but find that she should be the supervisor, NOT whoever this female was.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c3310d60ce4b2b:0x86f2dde64d64b921<//GmapID></record>

Least favorite Wal-Mart. The employees are so rude here. One actually told me to leave the aisle while I was looking at something. So they missed out on sales from me that day. I guess when your company is so big and rich it hardly matters. There are always pallets blocking aisles and the place is a big mess. It also doesn't have things I can find at other Wal-Mart's. Last visit I went to buy something that was labelled as "$4" on the shelf but it wouldn't ring up. The cashier insisted it was $10, I told him it's only $4 on Amazon so if it's that much here never mind... well I kept trying to get him to cancel that part of the order because he was holding up the line saying the product "wasn't in the system." So why was it on the shelf? Anyway, after several incompetent employees put their heads together they magically discovered the price was $4 and I finally got to pay and leave. I wish I could say this was the only time that has happened here.<//Review>

I tried to call upland Walmart on the phone to ask about a product, and they left me on hold for 15min  then hung me up, I called back again they did the same thing,  called through the pharmacy  they answered right away!  Ask them to transfer me to cut omer service he did . After several rings they picked up.  Then I ask for a manager,  she said they don't have one there only assistant , so I asked to speak to her left on hold again for ever. This store is the only Walmart that has this problem ! So now I call target right away they answer and helped me what I needed,  so target stole Walmart customer!<//review>

I was very upset and went to another Walmart in Upland where they accept it as usual. I do not trust Walmart with returns any longer, they have become too strict and picky on items they allow returns on.</Review>< Pics>

If you're looking for specific ingredients for your baking needs, this place is not an ideal place for a baker especially for the holiday season. I would suggest you go to Wal-Mart in Covina. Maybe neighborhood Wal-Mart market but no guarantee though. My all time favorite Wal-Mart is one on Azusa Ave in Covina. They have extra creamy cool whip. This Wal-Mart doesn't. This Wal-Mart doesn't have C&H or other brand name brown sugar. Doesn't have other brand of cream cheese. Doesn't have the rum extract that I really need for my pumpkin muffins. I was only able to buy Fisher brand chopped walnuts and pecans.</Review>

Least favorite Wal-Mart. The employees are so rude here. One actually told me to leave the aisle while I was looking at something. So they missed out on sales from me that day. I guess when your company is so big and rich it hardly matters. There are always pallets blocking aisles and the place is a big mess. It also doesn't have things I can find at other Wal-Mart's. Last visit I went to buy something that was labelled as "$4" on the shelf but it wouldn't ring up. The cashier insisted it was $10, I told him it's only $4 on Amazon so if it's that much here never mind... well I kept trying to get him to cancel that part of the order because he was holding up the line saying the product "wasn't in the system." So why was it on the shelf? Anyway, after several incompetent employees put their heads together they magically discovered the price was $4 and I finally got to pay and leave. I wish I could say this was the only time that has happened here.</review>

<text>I go here for prescriptions and sometimes shopping both picking up online orders and shopping in person. Pharmacy staff is nice. I get automated calls when my RXs are ready. Walmart is my first choice for over the counter meds too because of their store brand prices. Like to browse here. Getting prompt help for online pick ups NEEDS IMPROVEMENT and the reason I didn't give a full 5 stars. Sometimes there are good deals.< /text>< gmapID>

Rude employees so is the manager the only one that's nice is the greeter at the door. It's really sad that everyone's complaints is the same (RUDE )but evidently wal-mart don't care about our opinion cause they haven't changed.</review>

<review>I go here for prescriptions and sometimes shopping both picking up online orders and shopping in person. Pharmacy staff is nice. I get automated calls when my RXs are ready. Walmart is my first choice for over the counter meds too because of their store brand prices. Like to browse here. Getting prompt help for online pick ups NEEDS IMPROVEMENT and the reason I didn't give a full 5 stars. Sometimes there are good deals.< /review>< pics>

Look Walmart has cheap prices, but a lot of  the stuff is made cheap too. I dont go there often cause I dont like big box stores.  However, there are certian items I just cant find in other stores.    The lines to check out are always long.</review>

I bought a reloadable greendot card. When it was activated it was activated for one use only. I went back to Walmart and told them the problem and they did not care. Greendot told me Walmart is responsible, then Walmart said Greendot was responsible. I handed the money to Walmart and they refuse to reimburse me.</Review>

first of all, "Gil" is one of the worst Wal-Mart employees I have EVER has the displeasure of dealing with.
today I called asking ig they v has any guppies and the woman that answered had no idea what a guppy even is and when I told her it's a fish ahe right away said no they didn't have any. how could she know whether or not they had any if she didn't know what one is?! ugh so anyway I went down there and low and behold, they had lots of guppies.. so I tried to speak to a manager and after waiting about twenty minutes he I left because he was nowhere to be found.
when I hit home I called again to complain and got the same ignorant, lazy woman on the phone, I asked to speak to the manager and she wanted to know what it was about, then asked if I was the one calling about electronics.. I insisted on speaking to the manager and she then told be that Gil was outside and not available.
ridiculous, if Wal-Mart wants to jeep customers maybe they ought to hire people that will actually do their jobs.
I'm insulted and feel as though my business doesn't mean anything to this store and its employees.<//Text>

Good luck getting an employee,Almost all of them are always in groups chatting,meanwhile,and it is literally almost always like this when I come here. Aisles filled with carts or random boxes in the way,having to skip around multiple asiles because boxes overtake the walkways with either boxes and carts,or employees standing in the way. The staff doesnt even make eye contact,I say excuse me and they still continue their conversation and dont move out of my way. In fact just looking annoyed I am there. At this point I dont care,This walmart is bad if you want customer service,if you know what you want,Just use Self checkout.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Lots of parking ,easy ingress and egress, almost everything you could want or need.
Indifferent staff, clogged isles, and  sometimes inferior quality items.</Text>

No longer 24 hrs. Always short on cashier's no matter what time you go there which creates long lines. The workers start stocking way before closing time causing blocked isles and walkways while towing pallets thru the store forcing you to move out of their way. Not a customer friendly store at all.< /review>

The worst Wal-Mart Ive been to. The place is dirty and to many empty shelves. Three times Ive been here (never again) they didnt have what I needed, basic things that all Wal-Marts carry except this one.< /Text>

I only come here for small things, for the prices, and because it's kind of close. Usually they don't have what I need in stock, and if you try to call customer service for your basic questions, forget it. They'll let the phone ring and when they do pick up they hang up or they claim they can't hear you and the call is breaking up (when you call from a landline!!) Customer service is a full on JOKE! And and the money center is also a joke! Went to cash my check and they said it didn't go through  (Went to another place and it went through without a problem) but ever since I went that day to cash my check they took my information and tried to open up a Wal-Mart money account with my info! I had to call the Money network and figure out how they got my info when I never signed up with the company in the first place! Honestly I use cash for now on and I don't recommend going to this Wal-Mart the one in Fontana is way better and actually cares about their customers, they also dont steal info and use customer info for fraud!</text>

I seriously don't like shopping at Walmart it's overrated yes some things are nice price but other than that most of the employees don't even like helping you out and you can hardly ever find prices on anything and half the time everything's in the wrong place where the prices are it's ridiculous.<//text>

Not recommend for normal people, your car not secure at parking lot, inside restroom dirty, not much choices of merchandisers. Look for other store not this one.</review>

Oh when I asked for a manager the manager wouldn't look at me she just talked to the lady and acted like I wasn't there..

Bought tortillas there this morning they were moldy, tried to exchange at different Walmart, near my house and they would not do it as manager said they do not do that with food products.. REALLY,  check your product before you buy. Moldy and outdated.<//Text>

Gilbert  the manager is a very rude individual. This place should get zero stars for being a ghetto store. They open later than they are supposed to and the mens restroom is taped off.<//review>

< Review>
Customer service is what you expect from Walmart. Store opens at 6 but nobody can open any of the locked merchandise until 7. No returns until 7. Check my photo for a employees who stood there for 45 minutes doing nothing while I waited for returns to open.< /Review>

< Review>
Haven't been a patron at this Walmart Since Two of the managers refused to take my Electronic Gift card, I had to use it at another Walmart that would..... all store gift cards I get are for Target now... Walmart registers don't work for e-gift cards..rude and unacceptable Michael Marquez Manager.< /Review>

< Review>
I go to the Walmart on west foothill and and they do tend to be Rude at times.  When I ask we're they have  certain items I need,  they never seem to know. And when I call to speak to somebody in electronics nobody ever picks up.  But yet when I'm at the store their always on the phone and in the cashiers area.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) What a bad wave that they sell something and
next day cancel it in your inventory
I said they had 4 and they would sell me one day later
they always don't have it, you should update
your products and know that. they are selling
incredible that that happens to Wal-Mart.

(Original)
que mala onda que vendan algo y al
dia siguiente lo cancelen en su inventario

siempre no la tienen, deberia actualizar

(Translated by Google) I love shopping at Walmart for the prices, but I really don't know why ALL the employees are so rude and look, I've lived in 3 different states and the employees are always the same rude. It seems they are being kidnapped to work there.
Customer service is AWFUL !!

(Original)
Me encanta comprar en Walmart  por los precios, pero de verdad no se porque TODOS los empleados son tan groseros y mira que he vivido en 3 Estados diferentes y los empleados siempre son iguales de groseros. Parece que los tienen secuestrados para trabajar ahi😡.
