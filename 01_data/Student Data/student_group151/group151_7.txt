<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Lizell was the sales associate that helped me during my first time visiting the store. I came at a very good time during the  middle of the week, as I did not feel rushed to try on the products. Given that it was during covid, I had to wait in line outside while 2 customers were allowed in store. I liked that the staff did not pressure me into buying anything, but instead assisted in me trying everything that caught my eye. I appreciated that, as I do not like to be persuaded in buying anything. Lizell was super helpful and nice during my visit. Can't wait to come back for my next purchase.<//Text>< Pics>

BUYER BEWARE! ANYTHING THAT SAYS "vermeil" WILL wear after just two wearings, and omg you can find cheaper ANYWHERE. My le chain necklace that i saved and saved for got to be warn twice, and now its costume jewelry trash.

I'd give no stars if I could.

Worst product, return policy, and procedures I have ever experienced. They will not be in business long if this continues. Bought a piece of jewelry, it broke within an hour of me putting it on and they are giving me the run around regarding a return label. They needed a photo, my address, and still no return label. They now have to it escalate this" to see what can be done". Give me a damn return label for your poor quality!!!!<//text>

Ordered two sets of earrings for Christmas presents in late November. As of January 7, no earrings, no follow up and no help. Did however send a nice note requesting a positive review :). Website is particularly useless as the chat function is non-operational, there's no land address and there's no number to call. Never again!< /Review>

Mejuri is one of my favorite places to go. It’s the perfect place to buy a “quick” gift for friends or a one stop shop to buy yourself a little pick me up gift because you know you’re purchasing quality. It takes a while to wait for my order to be ready as they clean and package it. I don’t feel comfortable to peruse around and look at the other pieces while waiting to pick up my items after I’ve purchased my order. Other than that, I love coming here and picking up something new each time.<//review>

Great concept for a showroom. Though it would have been amazing to bring my purchase home on the same day, the amazing customer service and beautifully designed showroom makes the experience fun and engaging.

I’ve browsed the jewelry selection online several times and once I saw the quality of each piece in person, I was sold. Will definitely be coming back soon!<//Text>

<Review>I made an appointment for getting my ears pierced, and the experience overall was so easy, seamless, and hassle-free. I was greeted with a warm and friendly hello, picked out my studs for my piercing and then was quickly seated and prepped for piercing. Honestly, the longest part of my time was spent filling out the waiver! The piercer was very kind, knowledgeable and informative on the process and care afterwards.

My piercings look great, and I will definitely be returning and recommending all my friends to go and get their ears pierced at Mejuri.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I love the Mejuri store. It's beautiful, peaceful and the staff is nice. I like how they let you explore without breathing down your neck or trying to push sales onto you. They let you figure out your own personal taste and they are there for any recommendations if you want any. A nice touch to the experience is that you get to try on the jewelry. That really helped me with purchasing earrings. The reason for my 4 stars is because there is one thing that I don't particularly like and that is checking out. They don't really have a standard retail check out system. They use iPads to log into your Mejuri account (or create one if it's your first time) and they input all your information and/or card information manually. You can not pay cash here. It's not something that I hate but I do find it to be an inconvenience on my time and feeling like I have to explain everything/remember my password to get into my account/manually entering my card information/etc. Overall I do like shopping at the Mejuri store; the real focus is on the jewelry pieces and the customer service, which is excellent.</text>

<username>E T< /username><review>Love the store and services. I didn’t get a chance to make an appointment for the piercing studio but they team made time to take care of me and showed me all the stud options. I enjoy the ease of shopping in the store with no pushy sales but instead team members that just want to help me find the right fit design and jewelry. Ended up getting couple earrings and defiantly will return for ring fittings.

They also have an excellent text system support for customer service.</review>< GmapID>

Not your typical "high-pressure-sales" jewelry store experience, which I really appreciate. My only disappointment was that the pieces I went specifically to see (and buy) were out of stock at the Melrose location. When I asked about inventory, I got the feeling that the boutique doesn't carry much in-store (or perhaps I was just unlucky in my choices). Otherwise, an enjoyable shopping experience--it was great to see all of Mejuri's stunning pieces in person and to try them on. Will definitely visit again the next time I'm in LA.</text>< pictures>

Small, pretty showroom. I appreciated the salesperson’s help in determining the right ring size and viewing a few pieces I thought about buying. They do not stock anything in store, so if you want to buy, you’ll order online (as you would on your own). I went right before closing on Saturday night and there was no line and very few shoppers in store. Glad I got to go and see the jewelry in person.</Text>

<text>I'm a huge fan of Mejuri and love that I can come here before making my final purchase decision. Though the website is great, you don't really know what the jewelry is going to look like on you until you try it on. Y'know what I mean?
Everyone here is lovely, personable, kind, and helpful. They check in to make sure all your questions and needs are met, but they also don't hover and pressure you to buy something. Once you are ready to order, they will bring out an iPad and help you purchase it right then and there. Other than the showroom jewelry, they don't have jewelry in stock -- which means your order will arrive via mail. Just a heads up, in case you were hoping to get jewelry on the same day lol.
Depending on how many people are already inside the store, you might have to wait a few min outside. It was a short wait for me, 10min at most.
Parking can be tricky, as Melrose is always busy. I like to drive around and find parking in the residential area.<//text><UserId.>107181228116253534021< /UserId.>< GmapID>

<Review>I never, ever thought I’d be buying fine jewelry but I’m addicted to Mejuri. Stumbled in here with my best friend about a month ago. I remembered seeing targeted Instagram ads so we decided to check it out. Mejuri makes buying jewelry really fun, exciting and accessible. The designs are modern and great for everyday wear. I’ve never been a fan of spending a ton of money on things that are only for occasions and Mejuri does an excellent creating beautiful pieces to add some shine to even the most casual outfits. I have been back a second time to get my 2nd lobe piercing. It was painless and quick AND it’s exactly the jewelry I want! I always hated having to live 8 weeks with a random stud I couldn’t wait to change. Mejuri has taken away all my fears and doubts about buying gold and diamonds...for my damn self!< /Review>< Pictures>

The interior design has soft, comfortable ambiance and bright lighting. Staff was friendly but there will be lots of people lining outside so prepare for 30+ mins to get inside. I was glad they carry most of the selection so I can better choose what I want to buy online, though it will be great if they have everything in the store as a so-called showroom.

Please note that it's a place you get to see the products in real life but as store does not carry any stock, purchase has to go through normal online ordering process.< /review>

The store is spotless and everyone is extremely helpful. Surprisingly for not having piercing appointment I was out of the store in less 45 minutes and it was a pleasant experience.</Text>

<resp>{'time': 1576508143195, 'text': "Hey Christie! We're sorry to hear you didn't have a great time. Our LA store has a capacity of 12 people, regardless of staffing, as this is a fire code for the building. In terms of wait times, our standard of care and customer experience is the exact reason we create a line outside our stores, as we want to ensure every customer gets the attention and help that they need to shop comfortably once inside. All of our orders are hand-picked and packed at the time of purchase, so it can take some time to get them out to the floor, especially during the busy holiday season. We hope this explains things a bit better and that we will see you back again soon! Happy Holidays :)"}<//resp>< time>

<gmapID>0x80c2bf2a75ef403f:0x7ff974e2c9bea5ed</gmapID><text>This was one of the most horrible retail experiences I’ve ever had. The showroom can only handle 12 customers at a time, even with six people on staff so it took us 20 minutes to get into the store. Once I was finally able to purchase it took then 15 minutes to get my order from the back. When I asked why it was taking so long I was told there were technical difficulties. What technical difficulties could there possibly be when grabbing one single earring from the back? In total it took 50 minutes to complete my trip there which is absolutely ridiculous. If you all are going to have a retail set up like glossier, you should have taken more notes before setting up this horrible model.< /text>< userid>

I’ve visited the LA store twice now and both times was helped by Tas (i hope i got it right), the sweetest and nicest saleswoman! She gave great suggestions and had a great knowledge of all products. In fact, everyone there does, I could tell because they recognized my mejuri jewelry right away! The store is at such a great location too and easily accessible!

Tas, if you’re reading this, hi! :)</review>

Waited under the sun for 25 mins, got in and looked jewelleries, couldn’t find one that I liked.
Wanted use a bathroom before I left but the clerk stopped me saying “customers’ only” even though there was a white lady just got in to the store and went straight to the bathroom without buying anything yet.
I did purchase their jewellery online before just didn’t buy this time.</Review>

<review>I went back and forth with Jacob a few times about a pre-owned Mazda CX-5 over a few days both in person and on the phone answering any question I had (it was a lot of questions)

He was more than friendly. Helped me make the right decision considering pre-owned, lease, or new car. Was not pushy at all and went out of his way to figure out how to get me a solid loan (had recently quit my job making it hard to prove income) even so far as to consider mailing my dad a form to sign as my co-signer (it was his first time doing a remote co-sign so he was learning the process with me)

Chris and Yakob were also great and gave me honest advice from a financing perspective. Pros and cons about different kinds of insurance and warranty (my first time buying a car), not pushing me to choose one option or the other, but simply making sure I made an educated decision

Could not recommend this place more :)<//review>< rating>

Brandon helped me with the actual purchase. Brandon IS the man!! I thought it would take hours to make a deal, but Brandon from the very beginning was transparent with the quote over email, and when I got to the dealership, there was no BS and we made a good deal without having to go through the norm of salesman back and forths. I am super satisfied and happy with Brandon! Next Chris helped me with the financing paperwork. He is very nice and made sure I understood the terms and encouraged me to ask if anything was unclear, and emphasized transparency. Lastly, Mike did a final walk around with me, and made sure everything is completely good to go (from inspecting exterior to explaining infotainment/smart features).
Overall, amazing experience with the team at SF Mazda, very happy with it!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I had a great experience with my recent CX 30 purchase working with Mike and Brandon. I was amazed how transparent and helpful they were relative to other dealerships I spoke with.  Mike was our salesman and helped us find the exact vehicle we wanted and sent us pricing info in advance. He had the vehicle ready to go when we arrived and walked us through the various options for financing with the pros and cons of each. Brandon helped negotiate and finalize the deal. They provided a good offer upfront and did not add any hidden fees or other surprises which eliminated a lot of the back and forth negotiations. Throughout the whole process they did not pressure us and helped make it a low stress experience.

I spoke with a few other dealerships before purchasing the car here. Many of the other dealers were tricky and tried to hide maintenance contracts we didn’t ask for in the monthly payment, provided price quotes for a lower trim model than we wanted, or were very pushy to get us to buy.  I was relieved to work with Mike and Brandon and would highly recommend Mazda San Francisco!</Review>

We worked with Jacob on the car sale and and Chris on financing. Jacob was incredibly responsive throughout the process for all our questions and needs. They do not negotiate on price, but I was not able to find a comparable vehicle at any dealership in the Bay Area that matched their list price even after negotiating. Jacob was very knowledgeable on the car itself and convinced me to let the car stop itself at a red light. Fun times. We love this car (changed our life for the shelter-in-place period). I suggest doing your diligence on long-term warranty packages. Chris was pretty backed up the day we completed the transaction, but gave us all the time and attention we required. He was honest and understanding, as my fiancee and I were first-time borrowers. We felt like we were in good hands and still do feel like there's an ongoing relationship that gives us peace of mind. The dealership had also set up a lot of precautions to make the experience clean and safe in addition to being pleasant. It's a good outfit.<//Review><response>{'time': 1598306320642, 'text': 'Colin, thank you for your business!

Jacob and the team at Mazda SF made our first car buying experience super easy, and dare I say fun? Yes, we had fun! Jacob communicated with us clearly throughout the whole process via text, email, and phone calls (as required). Mazda SF was able to beat the local competitor prices and customer service! We will definitely be back for our next car when the time is right.</review>

Met with Jacob last week after a referral from a friend. Incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and communicative! Called/texted him a few times before and after the purchase and he was extremely responsive. Was my first time financing a car but I think it went well and can’t recommend him enough!< /Text>

Last weekend my wife and I purchased a Used Mazda CX-5 from Mazda San Francisco.  The whole process was easy!  Jacob our sales rep was great, he made the whole process smooth and easy. In fact all the folks we met at the dealer ship were professional, courteous, and helpful.  And the vehicle is awesome.  Thank you!!<//text>

I live in downtown San Francisco and was able to get the car delivered to my residence. My interactions with Jacob was very pleasing.

Came by last weekend with the initial intention to just drop off my lease and got in contact with Luis Calderon. Let's just say by the end of the day, I ended up picking up another car! Luis was a blessing, super up front, genuine honesty, and he made the transition of picking up a new car flawless. Super attentive and helpful with all the questions I had. If I end up grabbing another Mazda San Francisco in the future, I'll be sure to seek out for Luis again.< /review>

I purchased a certified pre-owned Mazda 3 from Jacob, and it was a great experience!  Arranging for a test drive was simple and fast, the car was really well taken care of, and even though I came with pre-approved financing they got me a lower monthly payment.  No high-pressure tactics and very friendly people.  Definitely recommend Royal Auto Mazda!< /text>

I was so surprised with how easy and simple the process was to sell my car to shift! All I had to do was get an estimate online, wait for Art to evaluate the car, sign paperwork, and get my payment! Everything took about less than 1.5 hours. Art Echeverria was great with explaining the process and I really appreciated his honesty. His service and experience was definitely a big part of how smoothly the transaction went! Thanks Art!< /text>

< review>
Royal Automative is a rare find amongst car dealerships, one that provides an easy and strait-forward car buying experience. I'm fairly critical of car dealerships in generally and I come prepared with a large amount of research, but they laid out everything so plainly that it really wasn't necessary. My salesman (Mike) made the entire experience easy and even enjoyable. I highly suggest you ask for him when you go in.

This is not a paid add, read through my reviews. I rarely leave good ones, unless services really go above and beyond. I really like my brand new CX-5, my fourth Mazda. I shopped around before coming to Royal Automative, but they were by far the easiest to deal with, not to mention the lowest price. Lastly, and possibly my biggest surprise, was that the paperwork and finance portion was easy and all done electronically. Yakov was very patient with my multitude of questions (thank you) and made the process a breeze.

Car was delivered on time and looked beautiful. Thanks Mazda San Francisco!<//review>

Mazra had us at hello when we try out their family pack  to end 2020 at home during this pandemic.

This is an impressive spread of high quality Mediterranean food that is worth the value. Their website with online ordering interface is also much better in terms of allowing the restaurant to keep their already razor thin profit margin during this difficult time of the pandemic. Our curbside pick-up experience was also seamless, with friendly and prompt service from their lovely staff.

We ordered the deluxe charcoal kebab family pack which included a spread of their perfectly seasoned and charcoal grilled chicken, kofta, beef, and lamb chop, which came with a family size tray of basmati rice, freshly baked pitas, and two sides. We opted for their fresh hummus and cucumber yogurt (Tzatziki).

We were especially impressed at how fresh and the detailed care Mazra takes to wrap our takeout orders. The presentation is beyond expectation, I mean, just look at my accompanying pictures, they're so pleasing to look at. This type of attention to detail is hard to miss and it conveys that Mazra is one of those rare fast-casual places that is actually of a higher caliber than other fast-cash places.

Not only does Mazra exceeds in expectation for the care they take to pack and wrap our orders, the quality of their food is also exceptional. If you pay attention to the picture of the kebob tray, you will notice that they line the tray with Lavash. Our whole rotisserie chicken was also carefully wrapped in Lavash which probably helps with keeping the bird moist during transit.  All of the kebab was fresh tasting, tender, and moist. I often shy away from lamb dishes because they tend to be very gamy due to improper handling, but Mazra's lamb chop was perfect; it was well-cooked and tender.

Their hummus was creamy and the little gems of pomegranate sprinkled over its top pays a perfect sweet-tangly complement to its overall profile.  Their Tzatziki is perfectly tangy and fresh-tasting that one simply may have a hard time stopping oneself at second or third helpings-good thing it is also a healthy option.

I haven't been so starry-eyed impressed with getting take out like I have with this experience with Mazra. I really wish them future prosperity and hope that they maintain this consistency of high quality food and perfect pricing for the value. Their attention to detail does not go unnoticed and I am so ecstatic to have found a place like Mazra.  Happy New Year's Eve and good riddance 2020. Mazra is a perfect way to celebrate the end of this trying year.<//Text>

I've been happy with the quality of service I've received with my vehicle's scheduled maintenance, but my recent experience with the parts department is having me question the integrity of car dealerships once again. Long story short, if you need to order a new key/fob, don't go any further than buying the parts from them. They'll tell you they're the only one's able to program the fob, but this experience has taught me you can get your key cut and fob programmed by a locksmith for less than half the price of what they're charging (you also don't have to leave your car there for a half day of service). If time is not of the essence, the fob itself is pretty easy to get on the internet as well.</Text>

<Text>I have been leasing with Mazda for the past 8 years and I love the CX-5.  For my last two leases, I have had the pleasure of working with Mike at Mazda San Francisco.   The first time I was quite impressed with his professionalism, respect toward me when I knew exactly what I wanted without trying to pressure me into additional services, and his timely manner with securing my new lease deal.  Recently, I returned to sign another lease and Mike was very consistent with my original interaction and impression of him 3 years ago.  He and his team went above and beyond to make the process stress-free.  I highly recommend Mazdas to anyone looking for a new car and even more so, I recommend Mike and his team at Mazda San Francisco to help connect you to your new car.< /Text>< user_id>

I joined TrueCar and got offers for a new 2020 Cx-5 from 3 Bay Area Mazda dealers, but nobody beat Mazda SF's price. So I went down at 11 am to test drive a shiny red loaded GT after talking to Brandon, the Sales Mgr. I ended up driving a sky blue one, which I liked better for the black interior (vs the almost white interior of the red one).
Brandon told me to take my time to think about it, without trying "to hard sell" it to me. I went back later and bought it at 4.30! And thank you too to Chris and Mike - all three made an experience I had been dreading into a very pleasant one!</Review>

<text>I just started my car shopping process looking for a new car to lease. After my first two visits to a Honda and Toyota dealership, my experience with them weren't as pleasant as I thought it would be. I started to think maybe I shouldn't visit anymore dealerships if they treat me like a tire kicker. Until I visited Mazda San Francisco. I walked in and Brandon Feng immediately greeted me with a smile and friendly attitude. Not like the Honda and Toyota dealership where I was walking around for 10 minutes and have to ask for help. I asked Brandon for some lease information regarding a Mazda3 HB. He first trying to help me narrow down on exactly what I need and not having to get something where it is out of my budget. We came to agree on a Mazda3 HB Preferred Pkg in AWD. What? they offer AWD? I didn't even notice that the Mazda3 HB now comes available in AWD. He then provided lease numbers to me and not only it met my budget but it went way below my budget. I really wanted to do a test drive but I did not have car insurance and I would have to get that to test drive and that's fine. I totally understand why that is. When I'm ready and if I decided I want to go with the Mazda3 HB AWD, Brandon Feng and Mazda San Francisco is where I will be getting my car. Thank you Brandon and Mazda San Francisco on making my car shopping experience a hassle free, transparent, and excited one! Will definitely recommend Brandon and his team here at Mazda San Francisco.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1601940393108, 'text': 'Hui Liang,  thank you for sharing your experience.

Came back 3 short years later to upgrade my leased Mazda. The service was even better than my last. Matt Davis was my agent 3 years ago, and was the main reason we returned. The entire process was extremely smooth. Even though I researched my choice before going in, I learned so much there to aid in my decision making. No upselling, no pressure. Will be back in 3 years.< /review>

Can't say enough positive things about my experience working with Brandon. I was very upfront with him on the year, make, model, trim, and color I was looking for as well as what offers I had in-hand, and he in-turn was incredibly transparent and fair in putting together a competitive offer.

During the buying process, he was incredibly professional but also charismatic and relaxed. When you're thinking zoom-zoom, think Brandon!</Text>

We love our new 2016 Pilot from Mazda San Francisco! I'm not kidding when I say I talked to every dealer in town to buy this car. Tempe was the easiest to work with. Saad listened to exactly what I wanted and delivered! Him and Christian, the business manager made the transaction a pleasant experience. We did have minor issues after the purchase but management responded very quickly and went above and beyond!</Review>

Had a great experience purchasing from Mazda SF. We looked at options from 3-4 dealers, but our interactions with Brandon Feng and Mike Les helped us work through the decision. They were very informative and responsive throughout the process, which made the decision easy in the end. Would highly recommend both them and Mazda SF!< /Text>

<review>This was by far the best experience I've had purchasing a car. Matt Davis actually listened to me to make sure that I got what I want, not what he wanted to sell me. It was so refreshing to have a salesperson listen to me, and asking good questions to find what fit my needs, not his agenda. I will definitely be back as long as Matt is there to take care of me. Thanks Matt!<//review>< userid>

I bought my very first car in America at Mazda San Francisco from Brandon Feng. He's very friendly and knowledgable about the Mazda brand. He also got me a better deal than my relative can in LA. Most importantly I did not feel pressured by him like I did from other Mazda dealers. I thought the process was very easy and transparent. I will definitely buy again from Brandon and send him anyone that I know who wants a Mazda to see him. Thanks again Brandon and Mazda SF.< /Review>

Had a pretty good experience here with Victor. He was nice, though a little tough during the negotiation (as can be expected). However, in the end, we came to an agreement and the process from there was pretty simple! Also, since buying, Victor has called me at least twice to make sure everything is running smoothly. Loving my car :).<//review>

I'm in the market for a new car and I'm not sure what I want. I went to Mazda SF over the weekend thinking just to pick up a Brochure. When I walked in, a gentleman by the name of Michael Yums approached me with a smile and a very professional welcome to me. He never pressure me in buying a car and gave me very useful and educated info to help me with my vehicle research. I felt very comfortable dealing with him. If I decided to go for a Mazda, this is the dealership pool I will buy it from. Thanks Michael and Mazda SF.</Text>

Truly exceptional salesman. He answered all out questions, took us on a long test drive, was very understanding of our situation, patient, courteous. Of all the dealerships we stopped into, this was by far the most pleasant experience.
I will caveat this by saying we decided to buy another brand vehicle, but after the whole experience we almost regretted not going with the Mazda because of the people and service this dealership provides. Check them out, I don't think you will be disappointed.< /review><Date>1527957577414</Date><response>{'time': 1528833000756, 'text': 'Dear Mark,\nThank you for sharing your experience and taking your time to leave us a rating.

Great experience buying a new car here. Gave a VERY competitive price on the model I wanted with minimal fuss and no elaborate haggling games. The price was so competitive that other dealers in the area that promise to beat any written quote couldn't even match it.

Aside from the price, they had lots of stock, and all the sales people I worked with (Joe and Mike) were professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient. They took plenty of time to go through any numbers, thoroughly explain differences and features, and generally guide us through the decision and purchase process.

Pretty much the perfect car buying experience. Highly recommended!< /text>

I have had some really bad experiences with car dealers in the past and had my guard up going into sf Mazda. I met with Matt Davis and felt instantly at ease. He actually took the time to listen to what I was saying and I never once felt pressured or up sold. Keep up the good work Mazda San Francisco. Amazing car and amazing experience. I couldn't be happier.<//text>

I can't say enough good things about Brandon Feng and Mazda San Francisco. After being dissatisfied with two different Bay area Mazda dealers, it was a relief to find an honest, attentive and communicative sales person to work with. Brandon found the MX-5 RF I wanted and personally picked it up from another dealer for me. He was an absolute pleasure to work with, and I would highly recommend him to anyone. Finance Manager Steven Louie was also great to work with, and made the tedious process of leasing a car more enjoyable with his wit and conversation. Thank you, Team Mazda SF, for a great experience!!<//Text>

<review>Manufacturer had a recall and explicitly said that there is complementary loaner vehicle service. So I made the appointment with explicit request of a loaner vehicle. Yet this dealership says it's only available to cars under warranty and first come first serve. What's the point of the appointment and if you don't honor manufacturer's promise, how are you even a dealership for the manufacturer?<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>My mind was set on buying a Cx3. I discovered upon testing the car that Mazda removed the right armrest. It's a spare part now. My back is so bad that I cannot drive without arm support. The team there, to my biggest surprise, could not come up with a solution to get that part and pretty much preferred losing a sure sale rather than getting the $150 spare armrest.

I recently visited the Mazda dealership on Vaness in San Francisco, where I met a Mr Matt Davis. He was such a pleasure to work with, wasn't pushy like other dealers I've delt with. He answered all of my questions and he even asked me questions to make sure he knew exactly what I was looking for. I will definitely recommend anyone looking to buy a car to go see Matt at Mazda in San Francisco!</Review>

<Review>I had a great experience at Royal Auto Group. I purchased my Mazda CX-5 and from the start I felt welcomed and engaged. My experience was smooth and comfortable. I worked with Eric Chen and he really broke down the buying experience and he genuinely approached my needs with upmost professionalism and sincerity. I also appreciated my interaction with Mosaud, the department manager, and really appreciated his sincerity as well as welcoming me to his dealership. Thank you guys!</Review>< pics>

Purchased my Mazda 6 there, and had a good experience.  However, the service department is expensive.  They charged $241 for the first 7500 mile service, vs. Mazda in Burlingame which charges only $140 for the same service.  I understand city locations are more expensive, but $240 for an oil change and tire rotation for a $20k 4 cylinder is a bit much.< /review>

Victor was so rude. When he knew we were not buying that day, he refused to let us test drive. I told him I flew from another state and I want to make a decision between this and Corolla for my daughter to buy after I fly back home. He told me to come back on a week end. Eventually he asked the next door VW sales to test drive with us. The poor guy doesn't know Mazda at all. Stay away from this dealer and Victor. He is terrible! He missed a sale because I bought the car the following week from another dealer.</Text>

< review>
I bought a new Mazda 3 from Royal motors in October 2018. I had also bought a Mazda 3 from them  in 2007 and a  Mazda 626 in 1993.  I have been very happy with my Mazdas.  This time, however, I felt I got extra special attention from Eric Chen and Masoud Modjtabavi.  They explained all of the features that I asked about for three different kinds of Mazda. I finally decided on the top-end Grand Touring model.  Eric was explaining some of that tech features on the Royal motors lot when a careless employee backed into us and scratched my bumper.   That might have turned off many  a customer. However I felt Eric and Masoud were so concerned that it changed my opinion.  They had the bumper repaired and repainted and I took delivery two days later.  Since then they have been very helpful  installing my license plates and pairing my garage door opener to the car and answering my many questions. Barring that unfortunate accident on the lot,  I have been very happy with the service I’ve been given .<//review>

When I brought my car in because my side mirror cracked, I was misquoted the amount by several hundred dollars. When I finally spoke to the person who had originally given me the quote, he denied ever meeting me. When I told them I wanted to take my business elsewhere, the manager offered to do the work for free but I forgot to take down his name. When I came back the following week for the service, you told me you had no record of my complimentary service and told me that nothing is ever done for free. I spend 2 hours speaking with different people to track down who promised this to me and after several hours it was eventually sorted out. You called me 5 hours later, as expected, to pick up my car and had me wait TWO HOURS to finally get it, profusely apologizing the entire time. When I finally drove away, the sideview mirror controls did not work and you told me to come back the following week. When I thought I was finished, after you had broken, and then fixed the mirror controls, I got home and realized there was a piece missing from the interior of the door and I had to wait another week for that piece to come in. I truly don't care how sorry you were ... the service was terrible and I regret buying a Mazda.< /text>

No information stating that they are closed on New Year's day. Called (recording says they're busy with other customers) and looked online (says they're open on a Monday), but no notification of holiday hours. Drove here only to discover that they're clearly closed based on dark lights and locked doors. No signage stating holiday hours. Other dealerships are open, so why not just state if you're open or not. Guess I'll buy my car somewhere else today.</Review>

<review>The service center performed an update on my 2015 Mazda3 that left the touchscreen useless and worse created a dangerous driving distraction. Even though the issues happened literally the same day that they performed the update (on the way home from the service center actually), they said they didn't know that it wasn't just a coincidence so they refused to take ownership of the issue and instead told me that it would cost $1500 for me to repair. I would never recommend anyone buy a Mazda, but more importantly I would never recommend anyone buy a Mazda here.<//review>< username>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>From the minute we walked thru the door, we were impressed with the customer service.  I have been looking for help in finding the right shoes that are comfortable to climb a ladder or go on a sales call. After being shown several shoe types and styles, I feel like I have a shoe that can support my long days. Great job to the team at Boot World in Chula Vista!!<//review>< pictures>

<review>Would not let us in at 755. Turned us away. We had a specific idea of work shoe we wanted... They let the guy right in front of us in but not us...... Bad experience... Over priced. Better off going to sketchers. Better prices more choices....will never go to boot world again. Lost a customer for like......... ☹️☹️☹️☹️< /review>< pics>

< Review>
This store offers different kinds of boots and other foot wears. I love that they have alot of varieties to choose from thats covers from kids to adults. The only thing i didnt like is that they dont have all the sizes. I hope they'll have all sizes in stock. But overall i love this store. I never thought they have good looking steel toe shoes lol</Review>

Good customer service. The staff were nice and friendly. Wife bought some therapeutic socks with a special discount price. The store was fairly busy and the employee for the establishment were taking temperature and providing hand sanitizer to customers before entrance.</text>

<Review>This location in Chula Vista was by and far the most accommodating and friendly Boot World location I've been to.  The young man who helped us was swift and nice.  There was a slight mistake made when I was about to pay. The gentlemen mistakenly brought the wrong shoes (I bought 2 pair of Doc Martens) but the 2 young ladies jumped into action and remedied the situation quickly.  Way better than your El Cajon location which did nothing but waste my time.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Good group of team members there. I placed an order there this past Monday and they said it would probably take a week to come in and that they would call me. However it came in just a few days after. I got the call, I got the order. Thanks Boot World.< /Text>

Nice and beautiful people I met every time I  went to this Boot World Palomar sites.

I went on this place in my whole 19 years.
Company issue every year to us, and this is
my favorite place to get my steel toe shoes.
A lot of styles that you can choose, and good
people/employee working here....specially just
last weekend name Estella helped/ insisting me to find what I really need. More Power to you all.<//Review>

<text>0 Stars! The clerk was Jessica H. Had to go to her for help. She was distant, didn't want to help, sold me some display boots that were scratched the hell out of. Didn't ask if I wanted to try on a different pair. Didn't say she could get another pair from another store. She's not good for selling boots! She should go sell tacos!<//text>< Rate>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Best shoe shopping experience of my life.
I walked in and was pleasantly greeted and asked if i needed help. I said i was looking for safety shoes and just browsing for the moment. I was directed towards where the safety shoes were and i wasn't hassled or pushed towards buying any one in particular. I was asked what i do for work and the sales lady shared with me a few features of some of the shoes available that catered to my line of work. When i was ready to try on shoes, she professionally measured my feet, and selected the exact right size shoes for me to try and she seamlessly offered me a set of insoles that made the shoes feel even better. She rung up my purchase and the entire process completed in less than a half hour.
This is the second time I've shopped at a Boot World location and I've been consistently very impressed with the product selection and professional service.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d94c2a18320ed5:0xd980df101e30fbc2</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Good selection.
Check the prices.
They were a bit pushy about some insoles. I didn't like that.
$200 for boots and like another $80 for some insoles!

CUSTOMER SERVICE GRADE A+++++. VERY INFORMATIVE. MY SALES ASSOCIATE, I BELIEVE HER NAME WAS SUSANA WAS VERY HELPFUL. NOT ONLY DID SHE LISTEN AND TOOK CARE OF ME. SHE HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS OF HER OWN. IM A WORKING WOMAN, 8-12 HRS A DAY ON MY FEET., ITS HARD FOR ME TO CHANGE MY MIND FROM THE BOOTS IVE BEEN WORKING WITH FOR YEARS. BUT I ACTUALLY ENDED LEAVING WITH HER SUGGESTION. SHE ALSO GAVE ME A WHOLE INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION ABOUT INSOLES. WHICH I CANT WAIT TO GET. VERY HELPFUL. WOULDNT GO TO ANOTHER STORE. VERY UNDERSTANDING. KUDOS BOOTWORLD. GREAT STAFF!<//Review>

We come up here during fall when it is the most beautiful and not so crowded.  The people who run the store are very nice.

Lake Mary is such a great lake to boat on. It has views of all the trees and mountains surrounding the lake.  This spot is really good for photos.  Try to make it up here in early October if you can.< /Text>

Really enjoyed the water and the lake.  The boat was nice as well.  But the owner of the boat rental is very rude and speaks down to customers. The rest of the staff was very polite and worked hard to make sure you had a great time<//Text>

<userid>108481994411127034176< /userid><text>We got a defective kayak and the owner was rude and blamed us.
We have kayaked multiple times before, right when we got on the kayak we felt like something is wrong. The kayak was very unstable which caused us to fall in the very cold water soon after starting. We got back on soaking wet and cold and headed back to the dock.
The crew did not help us get on the dock and said that the defective kayak could not be replaced. By that time we were cold and upset and did not want to go back in. I went to speak to the owner and asked for a partial refund but he refused even though we got a defective kayak and only kayaked for a short time. The owner was rude to us and was blaming the bad experience on us.
We left the place with a bad taste in our mouth.<//text><GmapID>0x80960c7fd061114d:0xae0febe9ccb792c1<//GmapID><Date>1593924085775<//Date></record>

Truly a delightful Marina! Opens in late spring (once the snow melts). Owned by Don and Betty Barrett since 1989.

Does fishing intrigue you? If yes Don Barrett is an exceptional fisherman and works the store at the Lake Mary Marina. Alpers trout are waiting.

Nature here is pristine and views  (from a boat) are spectacular. Do note the elevation of Lake Mary is 8910 ft. and take needed precautions.</text>

<text>We came across the lake and our little one needed to urgently use the toilet. We got refused to dock and got told due to us using a competitors boat we cannot use the toilet. I said I will buy stuff in the store just to have my little one not have to wait too cross the lake to use the toilets as it was urgent and he was in distress. But was still refused. I feel disgusted by the lack of humanity and compassion shown to a child. Shocking how money can come in the way of humanity. Shame on you.< /text><pics>None< /pics><name>Charlene Rupp< /name></record>

<rate>1</rate><review>Lake Mary is beautiful and our visit to the marina could have been an excellent experience. But no, we spent $28 on a peddleboat that took on so much water within 40 minutes of being out that it began to capsize, then we couldn't even peddle or steer it back to the dock. Tried waving for help but nobody was watching, so had to call out to strangers in a motor boat to pull us into the dock. When we arrived back the staff were more concerned about where we were emergency docking the boat, didn't help us or the people helping us, all the dude getting the boat back had to say was "i knew that was gonna happen " if you knew it was going to happen why send paying customers out in it? Got ourselves back inside to get our deposit back, the guy behind the counter half assed asked if we had a good time in amongst chatting with his work mate, when I said the boat almost capsized he just laughed and told us to have a good day. Your customer service and rental boat sucked, it's been the only negative experience of our trip through the US. Also reading a recent review sounds like exactly the same happened to another paying customer, maybe think about replacing your equipment with stuff that actually works or take peddle boats off your range so your paying customers can enjoy their time out on the lake.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>This is my first time ever buying tires new and I will tell you what it was an experience I worked with Joseph directly from the beginning till the end he is a knowledgeable person when it comes to tires I had them put new tires on balance and align it. The tires had a balancing issue vibrating and so I took it back to the shop a couple times to no avail in which Joseph took over and tried to balance them himself the tires were faulty, so he got me four new tires again different brand this time and had them put on which solved everything, Joseph made this process easy and painless thank you so much once again Joseph you're awesome I will be coming back to you guys for tires..he deserves a massive raise just my opinion!!< /review><Name>Shaun Nelder<//Name></record>

I came in with my car a couple months backs to buy all new tires and they were super friendly & professional. I just recently lowered my car, it's not slam but about a 2-3-inch drop I believe & I brought it to get a alignment. They wasn't sure if I was able to make up the ramp. But they made it happen. I was happy and thrill. I am a satisfy customer, I will come back here for all new 4 tires again after My old ones wore out. Thank you guys. My car feels great, alignment is great. Appreciated. 🙏<//review>

Went in for their free suspension and brake inspection and also to get new rear tires. They did a good job with the tires but I waited for nearly 2 hours. They also told me my brake pads were bad and showed me some pads that were cracked and worn out and said they were mine. I declined the offer for the brake job and instead told them I'd do it myself. Well, when I got the car back the brake pad wear light was on -it wasn't on when I went in- I thought nothing of it since the pads they showed me were really worn out. I ended up changing the pads myself and they definitely tried to scam me because my pads as you can see in the pictures aren't cracked or worn out. They also cut my brake pad wear sensor. Honestly the manger seemed like a cool guy and I trusted they did a good job but it seems like they'll do anything to sell a job. Bunch of rats imo. Stay away from this place if you need anything other than new tires.< /text>

These guys are almost always busy, but that's because they do great work. They also check your tire pressure and fill up your tires if one is low, completely free. The pressure gauges at gas stations are garbage in my opinion, so if I get a low air pressure alert I'll just take it here.

Aside from that I got an entire set of new tires from them for my Honda, and the prices were great. There is a bit of a wait but that's due to how busy they are. Highly recommend this place, either location.<//text>

I absolutely hate having to buy new tires. So many places try to upsell, change prices from what they quoted you on the phone, or have terrible service.
American Tire Depot and the guys there were completely different than any other place than I have been before.
Their prices were by far the lowest in town and I paid exactly what they quoted me.
They were very fast with the service and easy to deal with. Highly recommend.< /text>

< review>
I have been here twice.  First with a '77 Ford F-100.  They seem to be the only place in Fresno, CA that's able to do an alignment on my truck.  They also alerted me to the condition of my brake lines, which they repaired.  Next they worked on my 73 Ford F-350.  Their work was perfect, prices were appropriate, and they completed the repairs in record time.  They kind and courteous.  Everything was explained and I was offered both pre and post inspection of all repairs.  I won't take my trucks anywhere else.</review>

Mr. G (Manager) convincingly told me that there are extra charges for tire recycling fee, in addition my disposal fee, already paid.

While waiting, I researched the matter, and had found that the two terms are interchangeable, some places call it disposal fees, and others call it recycling fees, and are not separate charges, as according to Mr. G's claim.
Therefore, I refused to pay the extra charges, but had to go through the hassles of being deceived.

I purchased my tires from Goodyear they said they will look into the matter, given that they are a reputable worldwide brand, I trust that they are conducting business by all state and local laws, and have correctly billed me.

Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about my experience with Mr. G, at American Tire Depot, and will not be doing business with them again.

They went out of their way to ensure that we received the best tire for the best price, even after finding out that the tires on our SUV weren't the one's that nirmally come equipped, and were harder to find in stock. Would recommend going to American Tire Depot for your next set of tires, and get the warranty as well to cover your investment.</text>

I went to American Tire Depot for the first time yesterday 1/8/21. My sister Tina Chaves always talks about what good service they provide and how she keeps going back to them. I was not sure what to expect I always take my car to the car dealership. I was told by a friend to save money and go elsewhere to have my car serviced so I thought I should give American Tire Depot a shot. I am really glad that I did. They gave me a free estimate on my car they told me that I need frount and back breaks they explained what I needed to do and went over the cost with me. I did not have enough money to do every thing that i needed but the employee named G. Ceja went over all the costs with me and did what was most import to start off with and experienced that I could come back and do the rest he made me feel good about my decision. I was really inspired on how friendly teammembers were every time a teammember enterd the room they smiled and said Hello. Most places would not even  Acknowlege you in the Room or say Hi or even smile at you. Mu kids and I felt very comfortable I really like how  Attentive they were an appreciative of us waiting in the waiting Room. I am most definitely comming back for the air filters that I need and I also tell my friends and family members about American Tire co.

Tjank you

Totally took care of the situation as she was highly upset. This made the situation for me so much easier and calmed her down. I have bought over 5 sets of tires from ATD and about to by 2 more sets.

As a side note, it is difficult for me since I am somewhat handicapped and cannot stand for any length of time so had to sit on stacked tires because everyone has removed chairs for this  Covid-19 thing.

I can’t remember the name of the young man that helped me, but he was amazing. He was kind and patient. I came 20 minutes before they closed. I had a family emergency and needed to get on the road ASAP and needed 3 tires. They took good care of me. Even gave me a lil discount.  All the guys were very pleasant.<//Review>

I came down from LA and right when I got here a check engine light came on. I brought it in to American Tire Depot and Jose was able to assist me. The repair was going to be over 2k, and was having a little melt down as I was not prepared to pay amount of money at this time. Jose was able to understand my frustration and help me out greatly to find my other alternatives to get my car working for a very inexpensive amount. Its honestly the best place as they will not cheat you! Honestly ..Thank you Jose! You were the best!< /text>

These guys took great care of me, especially the mechanic Rick.
I had a botched alignment job done by another American Tire Depot on my way to Fresno. The guy never set the caster so the tires were rubbing into my wheel well when I turned, along with a few other issues caused by the mechanic. These issues where identified by Rick the mechanic who fixed it.
I took it to the American Tire Depot on Blackstone, and Rick took the time to understand the issues based what I've heard. It was easy once he found it, and a quick fix that reassured my confidence. Overall incredibly happy with these guys.< /text>

<Text>I had a great experience while getting my tires replaced at American Tire Depot. I had gotten a quote over the phone and came in based on that. They explained everything and offered me different options that help prolong the life of my tires. Both the manager and Assistant Manager communicated what was going on at all times. They did not try to push me into anything. I would definitely purchase from them again.</Text>< Rating>

I came to this business after being told at another ATD that the tires online are not the same at the shop and that they didn't have the tires that are advertise. A G. Ceja assisted me. He had a very poor attitude. Not very friendly. Almost as if he didn't care for me. I will never come to a place where I don't feel welcome. I notice while I waited for my vehicle to be serviced that he had a short and mean attitude with other customers also. Sad.<//review>

Really enjoyed the customer service given here, fixing my car has never been simpler nor quicker. Not being able to find the problem my car was having I took it in so It could be looked at, then this specialist, Guillermo, came by and gave me the run down of the issue and how to fix. Thing was running like it was new. Now I do all me check ups and regular maintenance with Guillermo at this place.< /Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Got a decent deal....was disappointed to not be able to take advantage of the buy 3 get 1 free. Apparently the tires I was looking for we're not included in that deal. I was able to get a hundred bucks back by way of a rebate by filling out an application for their credit card. So even though I had cash I paid by applying for their credit card I will send the cash when I get the bill. The employee that helped me G is very knowledgeable and helpful. I was able to get four tires including roadside hazard, an alignment that's good for 3 years and my air cabin filter as well as my air intake filter for about a thousand bucks. This is the first time I've ever bought tires for this vehicle I wasn't expecting it to be so much but I'm not disappointed with what I've gotten.<//review>< Pictures>

The employees, and the Boss is so nice.
I felt welcomed there, and they really provided excellent customer service, and explained to me what my options are for the tires I needed to have put on my car. I would recommend anyone to go to them. They even did an inspection to my car alignment. I am so greatful for them being open today.< /Text>

Ask for Jose or Marcos they helped me out so much today with a new set of tires & oil change! These guys are awesome, honest, reliable, and fast! I will definitely go back and refer my friends to them especially with all the perks they have with purchasing a new set of tires! 😁<//review>

<Review>Lied and wasted my time! I had a flat in the morning and after swapping the spare, saw that it was a nail in the tread. I went in and explained that the flat just needed to be plugged (which is "free"). After an hour I saw them move my car into the shop. After 2 hours I took a phone call outside and saw my car parked on the other side of the building (with the spare still on). I walked in and asked about it: "We can't repair your tire but here's a quote for 4 new tires that we can order..." I checked the flat in the trunk and they didn't even remove it to inspect it!!! They didn't even try! Drove down to Costco and had it plugged in 20 minutes! They wasted 3 hours of my work day! Do not give these liars your business.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>They charged me 89.99 to do alignment, then told me that my steering was loose and ball bearing needs packing and that'll be nearly 800 dollars. I told him hold on, I had the bearings fixed a year ago it isn't the issue, and that I'll fix the steering myself. Came home and had a buddy help me, apparently they did not do the alignment (very suspiciously that it only took them 15 minutes) at all my wheel isn't sitting vertically no sign of wear on the bolts other than lubrication spray on one of the steering link. Shady business!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO623fLKQP2Xfob7sdyUV0tNKPzsCU7AhgxPJdA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1541973540419, 'text': 'Hi Jaime,\nOn behalf of American Tire Depot, I want to extend my sincerest apologies for the negative experience at our store when you got your (tires, brakes, alignment, oil change) done with us.\nWe pride ourselves on giving our 100% every day to ensure that our customers’ needs are being met.

The lack of customer service skills and communication at this location has made me deeply regret my decision to come here for tire replacement and alignment. Prior to going in, I called and spoke with a helpful associate; I told him what I needed and he ordered the tires from the warehouse, asked him for a time estimation by which he said around 1 1/2 hours since they were not busy. When I get there, the person that helps me is not the one I spoke to. This guy was disconnected. I decided to walk across the street and do work at Starbucks. 2 hours later, no call or update. I called and the same disconnected associates tells me, "Oh yes, it has been ready." Get crossed the street, he tells me 10 more minutes because it's not done. Rather than explain to me to services done and charged or when to come back for tire rotation or balance check or explain the fact that I had a warranty for these things, he says, "Total is $730.99." I'm thinking he'll explain it after the transaction, but I got nothing. I asked him to write down  when the tires need to be rotated and he said they don't that there. When I asked him for a copy of the maintenance inspection for my own reference, he didn't know what I was talking about. Finally, I had enough and asked someone else to help me. With that horrible customer service experience I recieved today, I would never recommend this place to any customer who wants to feel valued or to any woman who knows nothing about cars.<//text>

<Review>They'll give you a fair deal, especially if you can wait for their sales!  I got a buy 3 tires, get 1 free deal plus you get free tire rotation and balancing for the life of the tires! And if you qualify for their financing, you can get zero interest if you pay it off in 6 months !<//Review>< pics>

I will be back! This was my first time here and everyone was so nice. It was a last minute decision to go in and I let them know that I was on a tight schedule. They worked on my tires quickly AMD got me out on time. I am used to these automotive garages taking a long time and trying to sell me more than I came in for. This place explained everything and only sold me what I came in for. Great customer service!!!</review>

I’ve never been to a tire place where I had a appointment and it took 2 hours to mount 4 tires when they knew I was waiting. I’m in business myself and never experienced employees who did more talking then work. They will take a walk in and get them in and out faster then the appointments. My regular tire shop can change 4 tires in about 20 minutes. They literally worked on the tires for over 2 hours and it was dead. Never again! I do not recommend this place at all</Text>

I was happy because I called around and nobody could get them in that short of a time frame. I walked to a restaurant and ate while they were putting on my four new tires. The prices were the lowest too. They took a little longer than they said but they were very busy. They even referred me to a shop that could check my brakes. They were super nice and accommodating. I recommend them!<//text>< pictures>

I brought my car into ATD because I was having brake problems, then they told me that I needed ball bearings. I told them that it's my only car and I need it for work. They told me that they can fix it within the same day and I will get it back by 5pm. It was 5pm and they didn't call me. So I got a car rental and went over there at 6pm right before they closed. They told me that they broke the speed sensor when they replaced the ball bearing. I told them, that I am not paying for it because when I brought it to them it was still intact and working. I didn't have any ABS light notification on my dash. They told me that I will get my car back tomorrow (6/19/19). I didn't get it back. I called them at 2pm on 6/19 they told me the car is ready for pickup. I went and paid for it $951.84 (work order# 49212). I got into my car, all my emergency notifications were lit on my dash: ABS, Check Engine, DIFF, and etcs. And there wasn't any power steering. I went straight to the Service Manager and told him, "you just made me pay you for the service and told me that the car is ready, but it's not." He told me it should be....Should Be? I just paid almost $1000 and it should be? For me $1000 is 3 weeks of pay...I'm poor. I expected my car to be READY...The point is, I am not going to pay for something that I didn't break and on top of that they wanted me to drive the car NOT READY. What kind of shady business are you guys running? As a consumer I feel that I was rip-off and as a person, I feel that the Fresno ATD have no morals and value if they operate like that. Don't come here you will get ripped off!</Text>

I bought 4 tires here.  They matched a competitor with a really low price.  I was pleased and very satisfied with the service and the efficiency of my visit.  I did this in January no problems with the tires since.  I will be a customer again.  They are busy front office staff do get to people as fast as they can and as courteously as possible.  I have worked in a similiar type of office setting the guys up front are working very hard.<//review>

I later called to see if they were busy so i could take my car again and the person who answered was rude, i asked if it was busy or was it ok to take my car that day, he only said "yes", yes what?? He answered my 2 questions in an annoyed voice and ended up hanging up on me. I also work in costumer service and i know better not to do this to anybody.</review></record></dataset><record>

I have had several vehicles serviced through this place dating back to 2010. I have had oil changes, alignments, purchased new tires, tire rotations, etc. The service has gone downhill within this last year. The sad part is, is that it is the same employees working at this location from when I had my first visit!
Today I took my car in at 11 am for an oil change and tire rotation. Raul said it would be ready at 3 pm.
At 2:30 I called and asked if it was ready. They said to give them another hour and he confirmed that both the oil change and tire rotation would be done! I picked up my car at 3:30 and noticed that the invoice only contained information about the oil change. My husband went in to verify if the rotation was done and merely forgotten on the invoice. Raul stated that the people must have forgotten to do it ( mind you, Raul was the one I dropped off the keys with and the one who took my payment when I picked up the car). He had the audacity to say that they could do it after they worked on another person’s car first!
The whole reason we bought tires through them was for the included tire rotations and previous experiences. I would now rather pay more money and have my oil changed in less than 30 minutes elsewhere. My next set of tires will NOT be purchased through this company.<//Text>

<Text>I don't have much knowledge about cars so I was pretty nervous going in thinking I would get ripped off but to be truly honest it wasn't a bad experience what's so ever. They told me what I really needed and what could I didn't truly need. They could of pushed me to buy things that were unnecessary and I probably would of just took their word for it.

<Review>Slooooow. They definitely need to hire more people. Waited on hold 20 minutes on the phone.  1 hour tire change turned into 2.5 even though I had an appointment.  Unnecessary up sells.  People are nice but hire more of them for the love of God.

Update: Was called by someone from the store offering things to set this right but I was in a noisy environment and could not talk at the time. Was told I would be called back, never was. I plan on calling them back and will provide second update at that time. 3 stars to start, 3 stars after call.<//Review>< pictures>

We had an amazing customer service experience at the Fresno store.  We were on vacation driving a rental vehicle and discovered a nail in one of our tires.  Sonny came out and looked at it and removed the screw and found it was leaking.  It couldn't be repaired, but he checked our spare and it was full-size.  He immediately got the jack and changed the tire and sent us on our way.  We are having an amazing vacation in Yosemite.  Thank you Sonny!!!</text>

The shadyness is real. Believe in the negative posts. I usually don't pay attention to negative reviews but this is the one time I wish I had.  Wasted two days of my time and money wasted because I had to call out of work. Had to wait for tires to ship to store. I received no follow up, I had to call twice to find out if the tires were in. When told that tires just arrived, I arrived 15 minutes later only to find out that the tires were not shipped. Sales rep although very professional, proceeded to make up a story on how he just received an email from FedEx about the miss shipment...due to two invoices with the same number? He must have some inside person at FedEx get the information so quickly because apparently FedEx just left before I arrived . No apologies or anything, blamed the whole thing on FedEx and told me it was up to on what I wanted to do. Also tried to sell me a different set of tires instead.  So I took my business elsewhere paid extra money for the tires but it's better than feeding the mouth of a filthy liar! Would have totally respected them if he would have told me  truth.  Truth that they never ordered the tires to begin with.</Text></record>

Complete disregard for customer service. They finished the job in a timely matter. But when you have me looking at my car that's done being worked on for an hour before you take care of me. Thats when my patience is driven.</Text>

Pricing was good.  They didn’t try to sell me expensive tires and gave me a good price on some mid range brand name tires.  Service was great!</review>

I had bought tires at the shop and was told to stop by every 3K miles for rotation. I took my suv in this morning without an appointment and it still was a good experience.  The guys that I spoke with were professional and I was given a time estimate that was accurate.< /Text>

< Review>
Came in because I thought I had seen a nail in my tire, needed it patched. They discovered it was actually just a small piece of metal in the tread, nothing serious, bu in the process also discovered an issue with my brake lines leaking! They were able to fix it on the spot for me, free of charge. I've always had a great experience with these guys, regardless of what I go in for. Thank you!</Review>

I own a GMC Sierra and lucky me I picked up a screw in one of my tires and needed a repair.  I swung by GMC and their service center was closed on Saturday.  Then I stopped by Chevrolet and they told me they don't do tire repairs.  On my way to another tire repair shop I spotted American Tire Depot.  They got me right in and handled business, and to top it off there was no charge.  It's not every day you get good products or service for free.  I'm sure flat tire repair may standard at most places but it made my day!!!  Thanks again!!!< /text>

Horrible sales staff, long wait. The man with the receding/balding hairline had closed out my order on the computer after I paid so that multiple cars ending up being seen before mine. Horrible and rude salesman. I was just getting my front two tires replaced and had to be at work by 1pm. I had paid and handed my keys over by 10am was told it'd be a 45 min wait, didn't get to drive off til 1pm. Was late for work and was ignored by the salesman throughout my wait. The workers actually working on the cars all were very pleasant and commented to say that he had "closed out my order on the computer" and that I "had been waiting a while" and that it was unusual. I truly believe the salesman was just playing games. I don't have time for that. Will not be going back.<//Text>

I had an unexpected delay in my road trip due due to taking a family member to emergency room in Fresno. I also heard a grinding noise coming from my car. I stopped in at American Tire Depot, they were patient as I tried to explain the noise I was hearing. I also told them my situation and that I was from out of town.
They told me they would check it for free, which they did. I asked them how long and they said “a couple of hours,” because of customers in front of me. I saw them test my vehicle before and after they fixed it. They were friendly and professional. I would go to them again.</text>

Tricky and dishonest. I base my review on a 4 wheel alignment for my car. I called saturday and made an appointment for 12.30, I was there at 12.10 and they told me all the people on their waiting area did not have appointments so my car was next. I was with my kids so I decided to buy them lunch at the  taco place across the street in the meantime. About 30 min later we were done with lunch but I could see my car across the street still parked in the same spot where I had left it. I decided then to go to the dollar store, 15 minutes later I went back to the shop when I noticed they finally moved my car to the back of the shop. I waited in the shop like 10 minutes more and I finally got my keys back. They gave me a $20 discount so I just paid $70 cash. I got my receipt and I was already out the door when I noticed I was not provided with the before and after print out. I went back and asked for it and Raoul said sure, I just have to print it out, he typed something in the computer and then went to the back, 5 minutes later he came back with a before and after that didn't show the information of my vehicle, just the measurements. I inquired about this and he said the printer had jammed and they had to cut the top part of the paper leaving only the measurements. I told him that I had time, that I could wait for another print out. He said ok, no problem, after 10 more minutes he came back and said the printer was still jamming and they had to restart it. At this point I was wary of the whole situation so I said I would wait. 15 minutes later he came back again telling me they could not fix the printer but he could give me a full refund if I wanted to. I got my refund of course. Monday I took my car to another place for the alignment and they provided the before and after. It showed that my car needed alignment, meaning American Tire Depot did nothing, and not even the measurements matched the "fake" ones from American Tire Depot. Tricky and dishonest. They don't service your car but still charge you for the job. You can look for my review in Yelp with pics of the invoice the "fake" before and after and the one the other place gave me.

I reported them to the Bureau of Auto Repair and after an investigation they were able to confirm that, indeed, my car has not been serviced and the before and after they provided was from another vehicle and not mine. I do not know though if they were sanctioned for this or not.

They contacted me like a month later inviting me to try their services again, promised they would make it better this time. They only asked for me to update my my review. I declined. One should get what one pays for from the very first time. An updated review based on a makeup it will always be biased.</text>

So glad that we as consumers have the ability to check reviews before giving our business to a company. I was ready to purchase tires from this place but something told me to check reviews before buying. Thanks to all the people who took the time to write a review we consumers won't be fooled by these two faced lazy as people.</review>

< Review>
This place is GARBAGE, I have to agree with Aida they lied to me about the alignment I paid for it and after I left shop my car can't even stay straight for more than 2-3 Seconds.! Now I'm no newbie on owning a vehicle ,but that's not the worst part yet... I purchased four tires online and went to the shop to get them installed i waited for about 10 minutes and then Raul came back to tell me that unfortunately the website was not up to date with the quantity of tires in inventory BUT they did have 4 Goodyear tires for just a 15$ difference. Since I was being assisted very professionally I said Why Not they also "hooked me up" with an alignment for 70 "since I purchased tires"
I declined road hazard insurance ,now again this is NOT the first time I buy tires , long story short in a few weeks my tire start going low so I take it back to get it checked they told me that they check the tires and they're fine they blame the weather they blamed the amount of PSI that was in it blah blah bull. 5 days later my tire goes flat again so I take it back and I'm already irritated of course , after leaving my car there for 3 hours they finally call me to tell me "We finally found what was wrong,there's a pin size hole on the side wall and it is unrepairable. Since you don't have road hazard insurance you will have to buy another tire" HA.! Like I said  GARBAGE .!! THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF SELL YOU DAMAGED TIRES NOT ALIGN YOUR CAR AND TRY TO RIP YOU OFF AGAIN.TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.!< /Review>

Nice People, Terrible Service.
I had a coupon for brake replacement, yet I was given and charged for an air filter which I explicitly stated that I did not order. The total price was otherwise fair, but it took 2 hours longer than I was originally told. I had to wait at the counter for a bout 20 mins before I even talk to anyone and my coupon was lost by the time I returned to pay for the work done. I decided to give them another chance the next day with a simple oil change, tire rotation and fluid top off... well at least that is what I asked for. All I got was an oil change as my coupon had once again been lost between the many different people who come to the registers to help customers. I had to wait this time only 1 hour longer then quoted, only to eventually hear from a different mechanic that my car had been ready for 45 mins. Yes, the people are nice and mean well, but their customer service, organization, and timeliness are absolutely terrible. For the prices I paid I expected the best, yet didn't even get what I asked for. I will never return to American tire Depot.</text>

Slow response time. Had another location in the franchise did damage to my vehicle by lifting it incorrectly. I am not sure how much of this is the local management but I have gotten the feeling that corporate just does not care. it took Months to get things resolved with me having to call constantly to keep things moving.</text>

<Text>I urge anyone reading this to avoid this place at all costs. I work 6 days a week, having Sunday being my only day off. I call them ahead of time to ensure I could get my tires aligned, they took my info and said it would be 40 minutes. Over an hour later they tell me my car is almost done. So about 30 minutes passes and Jose tells me they arnt going to beable to work on my car cause the truck ahead of me was giving them problems.. After he said they were almost done with my car? There wasn't even a truck at the shop! Then I'm waiting to get my keys so I can leave that place, and the mechanics start to undress and head home, while my car was still in the back! If I hadn't gotten frusterated and demanded my keys, I probably would have been there another half hour. Then as I'm waiting out front for my car and the guy comes flying around the corner and slams on the brakes when he goes to park! They will never see my face around there again, im so pissed off!</Text>< Pictures>

I am such a big fan of board games and this store always seems to have a huge selection in stock to choose from. Whenever I have a question about a particular game, 9/10 they will have a pretty solid answer. The other times they just tell me to check the game out upstairs in their gaming area! I've had some fun discussions with fellow gamers about board games. I definitely recommend emerald knights!</Review>

Lots of miniatures available and board games galore. They have some comics and a small backstock section that I enjoyed looking through. Magic singles and sealed as well were available with a small amount of pokemon to compliment. Overall very spacious and very welcoming atmosphere from the employees. Main takeaway is the miniatures available and the books for pathfinder and d&d. Was enjoyable looking through it and will come again.</Review>

Great place with a really fun and helpful staff. Lots of different events for MTG but standard is only on Monday and drafts running almost all day Friday.

It has 2 floors but you don't need to go to the second level unless there's a game, but those can also happen downstairs. Unsure if there is an elevator to the second floor for accessibly.

The only negative thing I could think of is that the place has a really weird chemical smell.</review>

They don't have much for board games, but they totally make up in the comic and models collection. Upstairs they have a open board game play area with a modest collection in the library. With only a $5 entry to get up there and play as long as you'd like I thought it was pretty cool.

I went there for a regionals event and the staff were excellent. One of the better put together events. Thank you and keep up the good work!< /Text><gmapID>0x80c29584d14d949d:0xc2c3d5d947025b92< /gmapID>< userid>

<Text>Didn't have exactly what I was looking for but was happy to recommend another store that might have this particular comic. Spacious place with a lot of room for its large offerings of comics, board games, card games, and RPGs. Also a massive wall of miniatures. Numerous tables and seating g options for patrons to set up their own games. Even on a Thursday early afternoon there were people playing. Wish I lived closer.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c29584d14d949d:0xc2c3d5d947025b92</GmapID></record>

The store had a really diverse and well-curated collection of board games, miniatures, comics, dice and more. What really shined though was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. They were patient and very clear, answering questions I didn't know I had. I signed up for their newsletter and plan on returning.<//Text>

The best gaming & comic book shop in Los Angeles. Support your local shop!

I have been coming here for over 10 years and it just keeps getting bigger & their stock growing. Owners Jay and Jason have created a store that is more a community-- offering up events (movie screenings, game nights, miniature painting classes), recommendations, and a personal touch that you can't find in most LA stories regardless of the theme or hobby. Drop in and just ask questions about what you are looking for & you will be sure to find exactly what you need (or you can order it). Their membership is also a great deal. Danielle is awesome & super knowledgeable about the best in comics so you can get some great recommendations from her if you are looking for a place to start or new books to pick up.< /Text>

About 5 years ago when I first got back into comics i thought this place was great. Since then not sure if the employees have turned over or what but it's really not as much fun of a store to go to as other near by stores. Also never really understood why they "up price" all back issues regardless if the issue is "key" or not. Went there today and unlike other near by stores no greeting or anything. Yet when i have my service dog they are sure unkind and call him a "pet" without asking about his "working status" like they are supposed to. Bu the way no service dog today as he was being groomed. It is the only comic book store in the area that tries to have a problem with service dogs or dogs at all. I went today to see if things were better (they weren't) and I was waiting for my service dog to finish his grooming< /text>

Good spot for tabletop gaming of all sorts. I'm not much for comics, so I shouldn't comment on that particular aspect of the store - so my review is mostly geared forward the tabletop side of things.

Pros:
Plenty of open gaming tables
Terrain boxes & covers to make your table look decent
Decent selection of paints and miniatures

Cons:
The location has a sort of musky "old and wet paper" smell to it. I honestly got used to it a couple of minutes in - but I can honestly see how it leaves a bad impression on an initial visit.<//review>

I played my first D&D session here yesterday and I had a lot of fun. The DM was really enthusiastic and so were the players. I had no previous experience in D&D and I'm considerably younger than some of the other players so I was worried about ruining the game. Everyone in my party had played a lot in the past. They helped me and I really enjoyed myself. I would recommend Emerald Knights to everyone, regardless of skill level. I'm new to comic book stores as well so I was very glad the staff was friendly. Emerald Knights is very clean and amongst the bigger comic book stores I've been to. I like the second floor type area and I think it's a very good idea. I look forward to coming back next Wednesday.<//review>

It's so huge that you take a piece of paper and jot the serial numbers of the minis you want and the employees pick them up for you.  The comic book area is nicely organized and prices are super fair.  Whenever I'm in the area I try to stop by just so I can get more minis.<//review>< Pics>

Emerald Knights has a good space in a great area. The layout facilitates the various crowds they hope to bring in: tabletop gaming enthusiasts, wargamers, comic hunters, and those looking for an odd collectible. Decor and flair are spot on, showing time and attention to detail. Various attached rooms are themed and vibrant. The restroom is in good shape each visit. The staff is always welcoming and happy to assist when asked.
The space for gaming is great, with tables on the main and second story. Tables are available for wargaming as well, although occasionally that space is used for display purposes.
Stock wise there is a wide variety, many smaller pieces catering to the modern role-playing gamer, collectible games such as Star Wars X-Wing/Legion, models and figurines for tabletop and collecting purposes, and comics/pops/posters.
There is a program to gain a discount on products in the store, which seems tough unless you're a frequent customer. Prices on many products are market rate or on the higher side. Supporting the friendly local game store is very important, however, the price difference on many of the offerings versus online or other stores can be substantially higher here.
All in all, many items can be found here they are unavailable online or in other stores, some unique items are available that have been used in popular digital streaming outlets such as Critical Role. A positive experience is had, but not always the kindest on one's wallet.<//text>

<text>This is a great place for comics, games, tcg, and for gaming needs like D&D.  I needed Goblins and found them.  The place could use more lighting.  Maybe some added decoration to allow the customer time to enjoy the place.  Overall, great place for gaming needs.  Thanks for the assistance from the staff.</text></record></dataset><record>

Came here to participate in a Keyforge tournament. The staff was extremely welcoming as were the patrons. The place had a very laid back, welcoming vibe. I immediately felt comfortable and welcomed here which is not the case at my own local game store. So I really appreciate them making this store so enjoyable. I look forward to coming back.< /Review>

I was turned onto this place by my brother, and once you go Emerald, you never go back!

The staff here is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. They're always ready to help, and when I was a newbie at model painting and D&D, they didn't make me feel bad about it at all, encouraging me to pursue my passion and showing me how.

Wednesday nights are my favorite nights because that's when Dungeons & Dragons is played! It's Adventurer's League, and the DMs really know their stuff. You can come in knowing absolutely nothing at all, and by the end of the evening, you have a solid foundation to build on. I've been hooked on D&D for nearly a year now because of them.

The Saturday miniature painting classes are also a real bargain and are hosted by one of the owners, who is a master at his craft. Check them out for only $10!<//text>

Cool shop it's big.... definitely a place for D&D fans. Love Danielle always helps when I have questions or looking for a certain comics. Advice: If you see a specific comic that might be "hot" call ahead. They do have older comics as well depends on the title of course. Magic cards toys posters coloring books pins is just some of the things they carry. Worth a look< /Review>

Helpful and friendly staff, great gaming community. Had a few nice chats with random customers while browsing. Best collection of miniatures in the city, though many were currently put of stock on my latest visit. While DnD rulebooks are full retail price (double the amazon price) they still have some great deals on many pf their items, and I highly recommend supporting this local and friendly shop over buying online.</text>

They are wonderful to deal with. I also like that they are helpful in dealing with my 10 year old's questions as well. They clearly care about both us older geeks as well as the new young people.

I come here with my boyfriend at least every other Friday & it is ALWAYS super awesome!!! Staff is AWESOME & friendly, as well as all the other people who frequent the store. Have made a lot of friends here & have also introduced many who I did not meet here to this establishment because it's a welcoming place for new or old card/game players. I will definitely be coming back when they are open again next Friday 😆<//review>

<text>Plenty of place space for games and a great selection of them. The staff saw us playing a game and gave us a promo card for the game we were playing!

I used to meet some friends here for a game a few months back, but we started going to Pasadena instead, even though this place is within walking distance to my house.

The place is clean and the atmosphere is nice, but the staff is really uptight about language, and I'm not someone who generally uses a lot of foul language.

I understand a business not wanting people to use vulgar language, but when I go to a store, I don't expect it to be run like a church either. The clerk said something to one of my friends for using the word "d@mn." That was a bit much.</text>

Great friendly and extremely helpful staff. I've been coming back for about 4 years. The owner and staff are about promoting the gaming community more than making a sale. Come to board game nights Wednesday and Thursday at 6 pm to see what I mean.< /text>

I love the selection and ability to play game on their tables but, being asked to move off of a table after setting up a large 40k game to accommodate 2 Magic players is a bit of a let down.</Review>

Great place, some dude was a little rude on free comic book day and made me feel like a theif for going upstairs with a bag. So I bought a membership out of anger. Got me good. Good places for games comics are a little pricey. But it's in burbank so makes sense.<//Review>

They've also got a great membership program that'll save you 10% on all purchases and also give you discounts on match registrations for MTG and other organized events.</text>< Pictures>

Friendly and approachable staff. Huge selection and plenty of room to move. Some hobby shops feel so oppressively packed in, but EK never feels claustrophobic.
EK doesn't just look to sell stuff. They have frequent events to really make a community. Family friendly, and great whether you are shopping for yourself or for a collector.< /review>

Cool place for game nerds, especially Magic. Board game selection is nice but not extensive - they're often missing even popular titles and I end up ordering through the big A.< /text>

We come here for DnD when our usual place is full up, and I love the second level table area! I've had my eye on their extensive mini selection.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><response>None<//response><Review>This store is remarkably friendly, organized, and best of all, clean! When my group of friends wanted to bring our game event to E.K., the owners helped get us on the regular calendar. They work hard to get Dragon Dice products available and are quite flexible with our ever-changing schedule. Never encountered any card-snobbery or clique behavior: quite the opposite! The Magic card players are diverse and friendly; they often walk over to us to learn a new game. Above all, I am thrilled they have such a clean and organized space (especially the restrooms!) which makes it easier to invite non-gaming friends. They always enjoy the experience of Emerald Knights because it outdoes their expectations of what a Geek Store should be like.</Review>< date>

I'm also into board games and they have a great selection of those too. The staff are all super friendly and help make the experience just that much better. I don't really do comics, so I cant say much in that area, however, the whole store is very well organized and taken care of.
Plus, they have regular events going on quite often AND offer a painting class for miniatures.

tl;dr Awesome store is filled with awesome people and awesome things. Spend time and money there.</Review>< Time>

Never had a bad experience with the staff, they are very nice and helpful. One big complaint, however, is the complete disarray the Magic the Gathering singles are in. With the exception of more valuable cards, anything valued at $5.00 or less is dumped into 3-lane card boxes sorted only by set, if you're lucky. It is not uncommon to find cards from other sets in the wrong box and good luck finding something specific: their card pool is extremely lacking.

How hard is it to keep things a bit organized? How about keeping rares in folders? Just a suggestion.

The store, however, is extremely clean and they have a HUGE selection of other gamer-related goods like board games, comic books, and the rest. They host Magic the Gathering events which would indicate that they care about their MTG players, so organize your stock already.<//Text>

<time>1361911125558</time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>It's really hard to not only find a combo gaming shop and comic shop, but a good one that caters to just one side of said nerdery. Emerald Knights does both very well. From a customer perspective, I really like the store's layout and the amount of sheer stuff they have available is impressive. I'm into Magic and Warhammer, then dabble into comics and other boardgames and I could spend hours browsing through Emerald Knights' store. If you're local, think about joining their member rewards for the 10% discount on all purchases.

As for service, I had a 5 min chat the other day with the owner and he knows his hobbies. I got some great painting tips and ideas, plus he was friendly and really helpful. I haven't tried gaming there yet, so I don't know what the atmosphere is like, but frmo a commercial perspective, this store is hard to beat.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>As a game shop it is only okay. As a card shop it is aweful. They are way over price. They do not sort thier cards and to top it off they have a very unfiendly clique manner. I work in burbank and would much rather go to Pasadena or Glendale then this store.</Text><name>Mr Naugs</name>< Rate>

It's a Big 5. Small store. Better selection and larger store at Pleasant Hill location. Merchandise is crowded<//Review>

<date>1556922004789< /date><Review>They did a good job trying to pack in as much stuff as they can in a relatively small space. Of course there are less choices than other bigger "big 5" but they make up for it with a great staff attitude. Their customer service is excellent, they were as helpful as they come. I called and they put what I needed on hold. When I got there it was put aside for me even if they were the last ones on  the shelf. Their parking lot is in the back.< /Review></record>

Very small but you can get what you need in most departments. Firearm availability is almost none at this time and you need to buy one in order to get the firearm safety certificate. There are a lot of options for airsoft and air guns though. Other than that not too bad of a location.</Text>

If you're patient, you can get dumbbells here, which are in short supply everywhere, for a reasonable price. If you are active duty military or a veteran, you'll get a discount, too. I was very happy with the staff. The store was clean and well laid out.< /Review>

The staff here is great. They are super friendly and helpful. Always a quick experience here. The store is starting to seem a bit dated, but thats most big 5's. The location and convenience brought me in, but the staff is why I always return.< /review>

Saddened by the management team here. I’ve been a long time customer but the service, attention to detail, customer experience, you name it - have all been thrown in the dumps. I wouldn’t reccomend this place to anyone who enjoys a positive customer experience.<//Text>

It's barely noticed from the street. This place has been here many many years. They have great prices on sneakers and other sporting goods. While they may not have alot of staff sometimes, The staff is excellent. The cashier greeted us and asked how she can help. Told her I was looking for sneakers. She smiled and called over the intercom system requesting help for me then told me to head back. I was greeted at the sneaker section tried on a few sneakers then bought a pair for a great price. I'll be back. Thanks Big 5 staff.< /Review>

Mom bought me some new snow shoes just before our most recent trip to Tahoe. I love her!

Really cute black snow boots and they were on sale for $5 off. Armando rang us up at the register and was really nice too. Great experience and the shoes were fabulous during the snowy weather.</text>

This Big 5 is awesome! Love the selection of trout fishing tackle and bait at this location. This Big 5 is obviously very well managed as it is always fully stocked, neat and organized. You can buy your California state fishing license here as well. I highly recommend this Big 5 sporting goods store<//Review>

I Walked in, register guy said how you doing, I said great, walked to fishing poles where there was a manager guy and I said waders and he said I got four kind where you going I said Boat, Tuna and he said what size foot I said 12, he said be right back. Came back a minute later with a ladder and said the ones you want are on sale, climbed the ladder pulled them down and said have a great trip, I then went to the back of the store shoe section and boom there was another guy that said let me know if you need to try on a pair, 5 minutes later I had new work shoes and a pair of daily shoes went to the register and asked for a fishin license and buddy said day two day or years end. Two minutes later I was driving down the street..< /Text>

Great stuff but where are all the employees hiding? Took me almost ten minutes for them to acknowledge me and grab *one* pair of shoes for me to try on.</review>

< review>
Shoe sales person Matt was especially helpful when I requested a NB walking shoes and none were on display and went into inventory and found an alternative for $39.00. Sometimes other stores have better prices for shoe u are searching for: check internet for best prices, let us keep Big 5 the discount price leader. Needs to carry NB walking shoes at discount prices: make ur customers satisfied and increase sales.
NB walking shoes 11 4E wide: plse do not divert me to cross training NB as a replacement<//review>

<text>I was happy with the service. However,  they said there would be an extra cost if she was in heat but she was not exhibiting any of those signs and of course they called later to say she was in heat. I was instructed to bring her back in a week to be checked and was surprised that I was charged for the follow-up. It should have been included in the over $150 I paid for my cat to be spayed.</text>< pictures>

These are most likely fake reviews. If you call them they will leave you on hold for hours and sometimes hang up on you.</text>

Great prices for shots and initial dog or cat illnesses. Downside is the time they are open for services. Other than that great Vet and staff</text>

Low cost veterinary care for cats and dogs. The doctor and staff are very nice. No appointment needed, but it's closed at noon and once a week. When in doubt, call and ask.<//Text>

Would NOT recommend this place to anyone.  To top it off, when asking for explanation of why they changed the pricing, they behaved as if you took your car in for service, stating this is our price, if you don't like it, take the dog and leave.  What happened to compassion?  To community service?  This is someone's family member, how dare they treat people in this way?  This place just plain SUCKS!

I have always taken my dogs to this location they have always treated me fairly and have even helped me with making payments when I could not afford to pay in full. Small staff which is great for those like me who hate when the staff is constantly changing and never know who helped u in the end. I have never had any bad experiences here always polite and curtious.< /review>

<review>They charge $100 to put a kitty to sleep. It's really the only reason that I go here, but the doctor will NOT let you stay with your loved one until the end. They also have many doggies that are desperate for a home! Staff was nice enough.< /review>< rate>

I recently performed at Vitello's Jazz Club in Studio City and am donating a portion of my proceeds to this wonderful clinic's mission to serve North Hollywood's dogs and cats.  Every little bit helps provide care for these deserving, unfortunate or abandoned animals. This clinic has been serving the North Hollywood area for over 30 years.  Thanks for your efforts!</Text>

I took my two yorkies to get spayed (routine procedure) and the Asian vet killed one of them. After having her for 10 years, I felt guilty for not looking out for her cause i decided to save some money by taking her here just because they were a few dollars cheaper. I went back to ask why she had died and all they could tell me was that she was too old. If she was too old why do the procedure? All he wanted was my money. Although money can not replace her, I asked for a refund and they kicked me out the door like this was my fault. Imagine losing your baby from one day to the next because you thought you were doing the right thing-- and to have a heartless so called vet tell you "she was too old" and have no remorse. All these people are retards.</text></record>

Well the costumer service is bad. I waited 30 minutes for my 4 tacos and when i went to ask they said "WHAT TACOS?" They did not give my money back either. I dont wish for my for money back but i do wish they changed the staff. Especially the old Cashier lady.  -December 24. 12:10-40 p.m</review>

you have to try their Apple store tacos and their al pastor burritos they are the bomb especially with the hot sauce that they put it's really good I don't really like the guacamole because I don't think it's guacamole but I usually have them not put it on but it's delicious everything else.< /review>

Bit into a rock inside the burrito luckily I didn't bite down to hard. Should have known by the looks of the restaurant it was gonna be nasty.</text>

Great tacos and decent prices. The al pastor are my favorite and it is hard to look for quality tacos that deliver. Thier carne asada is really nice. The meat is finely chopped and you dont find tough fats that can lead to a awful taco experience. Their sauce has a very good flavor but it's not spicy.</Review>

Where to start, order process or “freshness” of their food ? My order was as follows; 2 de pollo rojo, 2 de rajas con queso and their special of (2)tamales (I chose jalapeño con queso) with champurrado. I received - 2 de puerco rojo, the champurrado with only (1) of the jalapeño con queso tamales, the 2 de raja con queso were the only ones that came as requested. Now, I open up the jalapeño con raja and  and chunk about half the size of the tamal falls off, the cheese had been on one end of the tamal and for how long ?? I couldn’t even squeeze the “cheese” which from boiling one day won’t dry and turn hard as a rock. The masa was dry and dry and tough and when finally getting into the raja con queso tamal, well not that much different either.
There’s places out there that really shouldn’t be selling food, this is one of them. This is the first time I EVER say this about any kind of food, since I love it so much.......this was plain trash<//text>

Tacos and burritos are the best thing here. The tortas are okay, but not too great. The nachos are janky. Sometimes that's what you want, so I won't recommend against them, but they're definitely greasy lunch nachos. Great place for lunch during work. If you're worried, they speak Spanish and English and are very friendly. Call ahead if you're picking up during your lunch break. Food will be ready a lot quicker.</text><username>Kirk Bagdasarian< /username>< gmap_id>

The food has always been good once in awhile you'll get a plate that didn't make right but that's based on the cook the staff are a bit rude so that's what you get sometimes. It all depends what day of the week you come when you come at what time you come that's the different people that actually work there will give you a different service</text>

Disappointed. Tacos are the size of silver dollar and the “carne asada “ sure tasted like ground beef. Much better choices around.</Review>

If you want good mexican food (and i mean GOOD, not mediocre like everywhere else), then this is the place to go. Open 24/7. If you're craving a bean & cheese burrito, do yourself a favor and stop by.</review>

An im a regular customer who eats here 3 times a week. All the money i spend in this place and they charged me when i asked for a cup of water, and didnt even fill up the cup. They started chargeing because i asked for water. Also they are always rude, i asked for extra juice in my mendo and that i would pay for extra. They told me no and that if i wanted more juice then i would have to buy another mendo. Everything is nasty and made out of the can and freezer. All i like is the mendo and they are very stingy with that and charge alot.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I came and the Doña did not attend me until about 10 minutes later, Orita told me I attended. His pessimistic character that made me bitter the food. It took about 20 minutes for 4 tacos that they give me in a lunchbox at 5. He came and gave me the tacos reluctantly. I do not recommend them.

Vine y la Doña no me atendio hasta como a los 10 minutos me dijo orita lo atiendo. Su caracter pesimo que me amargo la comida. Tardaron alrededor de 20 minutos por 4 tacos que en una lonchera me los dan en 5. Vino y me dio los tacos de mala ganas. No les recomiendo.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d236aa1d88e1:0x1027f5759516a326<//gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) Today 6/5/19 7:10 am I bought a super Pesimo, Orrendo, without flavor and the broth was pure fat, it hurts that I could not take a picture because of the courage I threw it in the garbage and I also thought I would be out of days! !

(Original)

I've used mail services and Post Office Box services for about ten years. I don't seem to have all the issues others seem to have. Maybe I'm lucky, not sure. I manage my PO box payments online and have no problem even when I had a charge fail due to an expired credit card. I also use the online notification which scans pictures to see what I can expect when I pick up my mail.

The staff is helpful although not the bubbliest of personalities that work there, but hey it doesn't ruin my day. About the no parking complainers; jets it's right in the middle of downtown on two Light Rail lines and near many bus lines. Maybe a suburban location is better for you.

As far as the building goes; it's beautiful and I see something new every time I visit, so yes it makes me happy just going in the building. when your there next time, stop, look up and admire that beautiful ceiling.< /text>

Beautiful historic building. Great for locals to walk for lunch, near the courts Law library,  Spacious, elegant, lots of p.o. boxes, supplies for shipping, nice folks&other services available.  Parking not good later in the day.  Very close on the corner FM. St. James Park.< /text>

Just wish they delivered to the right address because I really think someone opened my package and kept the contents. I keep contacting them but they say it’s resolved. Clearly it is not... just upset.<//text>

We opened a PO box there and within the first month of opening they have lost 2 of our packages (out of 2) we were supposed to receive. they are so bad we started calling this branch the Black Hole! this is why according to  the Wikipedia:
A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it.
please avoid this branch.<//Review>

<text>Ignorance and incompetence, the only two words I can use to describe this place. I am so shocked that this place is still called a "post office". They have lost 2 out of 3 packages I was supposed to receive within a month. Extremely poor customer service and management. Please stay away from them if you care about your business.< /text><username>Mahni Shayganfar< /username><user_id>117821961242679585250< /user_id>< rating>

We walked into this building by chance and quite amazed by the beautiful interior of this building. It's rare to see a post office to have such a nice building and decorative interior, let alone clean and organized, especially the quiet atmosphere. With less than 10 people, the place is quiet on a Friday afternoon.</Text>

I don’t understand all the negativity about this place...been here dozens of times. Staff are friendly and helpful, let me borrow tape when I forgot mine at home; I’ve never waited more then 5-10 min in line, as it all depends what time of day you go. I keep coming back to this location because I’ve never been disappointed.< /text>

<Review>Finding parking is no easy task, but that's downtown for you. The building itself was pretty empty (very large and beautiful...it's an older-style building) and was quiet today, at lunch on a Wednesday. A very kind employee got my General Delivery mail for me right away, with no hassle at all. I know they have some rough reviews, but I had a great experience.

I have had a PO Box for five years at this location. The address is printed on my CAlifornia drivers license. For some reason my auto payment did not go through this year. When I went into the post office today and told them what was going on, that I wanted to pay for the box, they would not accept my drivers license with the PO Box printed on it as proof that this was my PO Box. I was told any digital records that the postal service keeps are destroyed as soon as the post office receives non payment. That I need proof of my physical address before I can own a PO Box. (Despite the point of a PO Box is to receive mail if you don’t have a physical address).
This post office is terrible. It has no parking. The staff are rude.</Text>

Lost my package with money orders in it.  They can’t track it down regardless of tracking number linked with it. I was asked same details again and again. Went to the inspector general on 1st floor so that they could avoid a crime and track down my package so that nobody would be able to cash out my money orders. The  inspector says they could not help untill crime has occurred. Looks like they don’t like to avoid mail related crime. All they do is investigate. Very weird system. Very overlapping responsibilities and too many gaps in customer service. Never using USPS in my life.<//Text>

<Review>My favorite post office in town. Chill staff, easy to work with, no one's in a rush. There's a separate help desk to get help if you're new. And media mail is the best deal of all! Sounds like some reviewers below had some serious issues and others just sound like they want the world to be as badly in a hurry as they are.</Review>< Pics>

Nothing good to say about the level of service. This branch has lost our HOAs common room keys on 4 occasions in the last year. This has forced us to rekey our facility on multiple occasions. This has been very expensive and a huge security issues. Unfortunately it gets worse. We were notified that the master keys (USPS key) have been lost on multiple occasions and on a somewhat consistent basis we have videos of people opening our mailboxes at night stealing all mail in them. Talking with “management” results in nothing but excuses and no solutions to the issues. I’m not one to say privatize government services but USPS is a sinking ship. With security issues like loosing master keys to thousands of mailboxes something needs to change. As our HOA President and Community Watch Block Capitan I have no answers for our issues other than USPS will do nothing to solve the issues.</text>

I have to say that overall USPS has declined in service and I don’t blame customers for going away as I will use them only as a last resource.

I have been trying to locate a package that was supposed to be delivered 3 weeks ago, it needed a signature so they left me a note, I waited a couple of days and wrote on the note to leave package as an option in the paper but package never came so I went to their office and they told me that it wasn’t there and to wait a couple of days for te-delivery, well today was my third trip to their office and while the line for parcel pick up was backed up the general service line was empty, I asked a manager for help and one of the employees offered to help but manager did not let him help instead she ask the only other employee on the busy line to hurry and to skip the person if she can not find a package, this is so unprofessional but going back to my package, it’s lost and they claim they sent it back already, nice going and so much for using the insurance option on my package if the person loosing it is the company delivering the package.</text>

Doesn’t even deserve one star. If your mail runs through this office plan on a lot of missing items. The people responsible for delivery will mislabel your packages as delivered when they are not and as a result the packages get lost in USPS hell. If you have time sensitive anything or mail order medications make sure they go through another delivery option. This office will let you die before they actually do their jobs.< /review>

I looked up the USPS on google maps and saw terrible customer ratings but a lower than average wait time on the Wednesday before Christmas!  They had a Customer Service postal worker stations outside of the counters who pointed me in the right direction.

On my turn the Gentleman behind the counter shouted, “Are you ready or what?”  (Minus 1 Star) But was extremely pleasant once I got to the counter.  I got back in line a few minutes later (there was no line) with a different need and was helped right away and cheerfully.

I think it’s best to check their volume before going in.< /text>

<review>If i could give this place 0 stars, I would. I have never dealt with such horrible customer service and rude employees. I was in line well before closing time, but due to the slow service I wasn't served until close to 5. The employee who was at the counter said he "couldn't find" the PO box I was trying to send a box to and his only response was "that's a bummer." Instead of helping me, he responded that the post office was now closed and I could come back tomorrow. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Drove to UPS a mile away, and was treated like *gasp* an actual human being (not to mention a paying customer). Somehow they easily found the PO box and were exceedingly polite and helpful. No wonder the post office is going out of business.<//review>< Pics>

So, I am at an average of one complaint a week with our St James station post office lately. My items are routinely delayed, if they require signature, then they don't redeliver despite me following the instructions, today, item was scanned in as delivered, yet nothing is in the mailbox/cluster/anywhere. A couple times that I've tried to talk to him, mailman was rude and did not care. I've had times where he claimed he did not have an item, I've driven to 1st street office, stood in line, then they told me HE had it. I've spent countless hours dealing with them on and on. If you've tried calling the St James station, then you know the drill - they hang up on you.
For the record, this is my first time having an issue with the delivery of every other incoming shipment in 20 yrs. Always was amazed how well USPS worked until moving to my current address which is unfortunately, is served by this horrible station.</text>

I had a note in my PO Box that said I had a package. Waited in line for almost an HOUR, even though there were only 4 or so people in front of me. When I got to the front of the line for people who are trying to pick up packages, the lady said she couldn't find it, so go wait in that other line to talk top different clerk. Clerk says he doesn't know where package is, he'll call me back.

I guess I'll just have to see what happens.

I have never done a review on a business but i just could not contain myself and stress how upset i am with this postal office!! If you are able, you need to avoid at all cost. They were to deliver a priority envelope to the courthouse with very important and personal information, a week ago, yet my mail is now lost and i cannot get them to tell me where it is nor do they care!! I am beyond livid and if i could sue i would!!! This place needs to be shut down IMMEDIATELY!! If unable to trust the postal office with our mail then what are we to do!!!!</text>

<text>The workers are incredibly unhelpful. If I could leave negative stars I would. They are rude and will provide no help unless someone is doing a simple mailing task.

I had my address miss printed by their employees and so it was undeliverable. I went in to talk to them in person about this after calling and having the phone just ring for 20minutes straight. Once talking to an employee he refused to give me any help as he stated “your emails are probably forged and fake. The provide no proof that this product mailed to said address is yours.” Even though I had my ID, the tracking number, and the confirmation emails from the company that the product was mine and being mailed with said order number and tracking number.

I'll just be preaching to the choir...let's just say, due to the poor customer service and a control freak, I have been left in debit and out of a home. Someone was and continues to withhold my pay checks.  I had no money for the TG holiday. I've gone all the way to the inspector general. Check was still late. The problem is still there. They all need to be relocated. I had no idea this place had such a poor rating until today. Will not renew my PO Box at this location. What a shame.< /text>

I have literally been a long term customer there at St. James location. My PO BOX has been there for many many years.

If I could give negative stars, I would. Consistently do not deliver even though they send notification saying a delivery was made. Consistently send notifications that delivery was attempted when, in fact, an attempt was never made. Always, always, always rude and terse when you go visit in-person to find out where your mail is that was not delivered. Always rude on the phone (if they even pick up the phone which they do not 80% of the time). In any other job, you get fired for performing so consistently dismally and for maintaining the lowest possible standard of customer service. This office is a waste of tax payer dollars.</review>

<Date>1486430467284< /Date><rating>3</rating><Review>I been to this Post Office for years, despite the building's beautiful architecture and immense detail is nice. However, customer service is quite poor and slow.
For me, employee's attitude were pretty neutral, (meaning not mean nor nice, just meh) I mean I can see they're there to do their job and maybe they don't enjoy it as much but it looks pretty obvious they care less about what happens to the customer. Also with this type of attitude, it kinda influenced their performance when providing a service. What I suggest they either hire new employees that seem more enthusiastic in the job or actually improve themselves to provide faster or efficient assistance.

Sad to say I don't think they're idiots like the comments say they do but I do agree with customers saying that they need to put more effort on helping or providing a faster service. At least provide a more helpful attitude, not self-centered one.
Hopefully, instead of shutting the place down, they can be better by providing more staff employees or offer something to improve the service.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Wow - they never answer the phone when I call but for some strange reason when I wait 1/2 hour in line to pick up a letter (because they left me a BLANK post it note) all of a sudden this woman answers the phone and proceeds to be on that call for like 10 minutes while I am waiting.  They says the letter is "undeliverable as addresses" even though the address to this building was selected by them - grrrr   Funny thing is that UPS and FedEx have no problem delivering to this new building but the post office cant find it - even though THEY set the address.  Yup no wonder they are going out of business.< /review>

This place doesn't even deserve to be rated. I had no choice but to select a 1 star rating to leave this comment. This post office is an absolute, without a doubt, VERY poor example of Customer Service! Slow and unfriendly staff with attitude! I get so frustrated every time I go to this location to get my hold mail because they're so DAMN slow with processing my order for a new post office box key which is located outside of my apartment. I've paid $50 for a key a month ago! I have to spend two dollars for parking and wait in line for almost an hour just to get helped every time I go here! Why hasn't anyone taken the time out to retrain the staff here and to speed up the processes?!!!?!!!!?!!!!! This place drastically needs to improve in so many fronts! I can't wait until I get the key I ordered!<//Text>

We are missing out on time sensitive documentation. We are not receiving all of our mail. This is the worst Post Office I ever dealt with in San Jose. I moved because the rent was high, now I cannot get all of my mail. The federal government should be ashamed  of their bad service.</text>

The classic beautiful architecture of this office is a stark contrast to the lack of customer service provided by the personnel at the Julian St office.

This office has been neglected for years.  It seems like most of the staff act like they're working in Siberia. They appear to be understaffed and morale is underwhelming at best.

There are no automated machines so you have to wait in line only to deal with surly employees who act like the "Soup Nazi".on the old Seinfeld series.

It also reflects in how my house is served by the assigned carrier.  I haven't had a regular carrier in years.  Sometimes the mail isn't delivered until 7:00 or later at night.  They frequently "forget" to vacation hold my mail.< /review>

<name>carisa keller<//name><Text>Horrible carrier service.  If it's raining, forget about getting mail or packages delivered.  Mail carrier will mark tracking as "receptacle blocked" rather than getting out of their vehicle and putting mail in mailbox or package on your doorstep.  Sometimes they mark it as "available for pick up" and deliver it the next day.  No accountability...must be nice to have a job but not actually do your job.  Going on two days no mail or packages.  What a joke.  Calling the location and asking for assistance doesn't help.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Incredible how this place is even in business. No personnel available to take care of clientele. Only three people for two VERY LONG lines. A fourth person guides folks to each line? Really? Why doesn't she get behind the counter and help!!  We stood for 45 minutes to receive our hold mail only to receive someone else's mail !!!  We turned around and gave it back, three days later, we're still waiting for our hold mail to be delivered.
We're writing a letter directly to the Post Master because we don't think anyone working there reads these reviews! -- Awful place. Awful customer service.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><name>Blair Southern<//name><response>None< /response><user>115847969784588417343</user>< Gmap_id>

<text>I can only mirror what everyone else has said, you can see that most people give this a one star for good reason. 1) Horrible wait times, I have had to wait an hour in line to pick up a package for non peak times-one window open for literally 20+ people in line, around Christmas, I had to wait over 90 minutes to pick up a package.  2) Delivery from this center absolutely sucks because I have packages arrive there on a Wed, sent Mon, for a 2 day delivery, still not delivered by that Sat.  They sit there and sit there, for days.  3) Delivery person that the delivers the mail only delivers my mail every other day, and screws up the address that items should be delivered to.  Too bad I can't give it a -1 star.  They obviously know they are screwing up, because as of 6/23/17 they have a sign saying something like, "We heard your concerns and are trying to address those problems"  or something like that, in the lobby when you go in there now.  Good luck, and I mean that.<//text>< Rate>

I go in because they keep putting my packages onto the wrong delivery truck and I have had 2 failed deliveries because they keep doing this so I go to ask them where my package is AND OF COURSE THE GUY SAID HE DOESNT KNOW!  Without even looking in a computer or even looking for my package and why it keeps getting put on the wrong truck so i asked if they can just hold it for me so I can pick it up since they have failed to deliver it. They guy said there is nothing he can do because its on a truck!?! Like isn't there some thing you can do to hold it so they don't send my packages back. He just stared at me and when I asked to speak to a supervisor he refused to get them and told the other workers not to help me! I just want my package is all that I freaking paid for.

<Review>This is the most inept, unqualified, rude, completely and utterly useless and worthless group of employees I have ever experienced in all of my years utilizing the USPS. I called multiple times to inquire as to whether or not I could pick up a package that is currently at this location, to be told that it wouldn't be a problem. When I arrive, I wait for over 20 minutes while the employees move slower than a sloth. Then I FINALLY get to the counter and inquire about my package (which is worth over $2000.00USD) as well as ask about getting a few flat rate boxes. Not only is my package there, but no, I may not have it. Also, they are currently "out" of the size box I need, when I can see a stack of them behind the employee that is helping me, IN CLEAR SIGHT! Every single employee here is a waste of valuable oxygen here in the Bay Area.</Review>< pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I'll start off by saying, I have never in my life written a review for anything on the internet. This place has been so terrible, so consistently, that I have chosen to go out of my way to tell other people to stay far far away. For the FIFTH time now I have checked the tracking info of a package to find that the package was delivered (it was not) but was "given directly to a receptionist or front desk". Bear in mind, I live in a private home with no front desk... just a front door. There are no gates around my house or anything that could possibly stop the incompetent postal delivery guy to be unsuccessful in delivering my package. On the same day that this package was "delivered" (it was not) I successfully received another package from usps. On top of all that, when I tried to call this post office, the phone rang for minutes until it just hung up. Multiple times. This place needs to be shut down and the employees need to be fired.</Text>< pictures>

Gave my package away to another person. Do not want to claim responsibility for loss. Not before they tried to blame label and wrong zip code. After investigating label was fine, they just gave my package to someone else. I'm out of money and product, very unprofessional with no regard. shame on them.< /review>

<review>Benjamin Franklin would be ashamed of this U.S. Postal Office!
I went to mail a package and realized I needed like 3" to 5" more of tape to make it really secure. I asked for a small piece of tape (They, have rolls of it.). I was astonished that the U.S.P.S. Clerk refused my request and, insisted that I buy a $5.00 roll of overpriced tape. I said I don't use a lot of that kind of tape. He didn't seem to care. So, out of principle I went elsewhere. How cheap can you get?! 5 lousy inches jeez.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fcca29110ce75:0xa0d82648cec8dad7</gmap_id></record>

Worst post office in history. Not only incompetent but horribly rude as well. Our community mailboxes were damaged and all of our mail had to be kept at this post office. They lost all of it and three months worth of mail disappeared. They offered no apology and said it was not their fault. Every visit to this post office has been absolutely dreadful. Unless you have no choice, avoid this post office at all costs!< /Review>

<review>My package is stuck in the "return Bin". I didn't put a business name on the "To" address and they can't delivery to a real address.
The worst thing is: they put my package in the "return Bin" and haven't returned to the sender yet. It has been 31 days. I called and asked if they can remove it and I can pick up? The short answer is "there is thousand" of them in the return bin and the machine is broken" . Please do yourself a favor and skip this post.

My mail was stolen from my apartment and this post office is supposed to be my temporary site until the mailbox is fixed.  I have not received my mail since Christmas.  It is now Jan. 7.  Attitude by a post office employee is to complain on line, they don't have it!  Rudest customer service I have ever experienced.  I have complained to the US Inspector General.  I am waiting for a response.< /text>

Absolutely Horrible!!!!!!! I've been here multiple times to take care of things and every time it was a disappointment. Never once made it to the window because the Asian lady that goes down the line asking what you're there for is completely rude right of the bat. Instead of listening to why I'm am there in the first place she quickly cuts you off to tell you "we don't do that" or "we don't have time" when I called USPS and they told me to go there. I tried explaining my situation and instead of listening to me so she could thoroughly help me and understand the situation. She cuts me off, tries to tell me why I'm there....and then tried to make me leave the line by saying just wait for it to arrive when the message online clearly said my package would be held there until I picked it up or would be returned to sender. Hate going to this place mainly because of this one lady!< /Review>

I told her my mailbox's lock was defective and she gives me an attitude from the beginning. What pissed me off was that she told me to bring all three keys and the receipt in the rudest way, but I told that if I can bring my bank statement to show that I paid the $25 because I did not have the receipt with me and she said no! I was calm most of the time she was being rude. Literally I was going to just yell at her but I did not want to cause any trouble. My suggestion to the Postal Office is to fire her. And she thinks she knows my story when I told her that I tried every mailbox to see if anyone of them were mine. I even told her that my leasing papers does not provide me with the "number for my mailbox".</text><user_id>111370006282167831270< /user_id><pics>None< /pics>< username>

Worst postal service ever! The mail personnel are slow and seem just don't care to help you. Ask for manager and end up waiting 30 minutes or longer and they never come. I believe they're not telling them! Their sorry mailmen are always putting the wrong mail in our boxes and don't bother to try to deliver packages. What's worst is I live Down Town in an apartment building on the 1st floor. I have two apartment doors that are accessible, one which is laterally 25 feet from the mailbox and when I have a package the mailman is too damn lazy to walk to my door so they just leave the packages outside front of the building which gets stolen every single time! I've along with the other tenants have made hundreds of complaints but they still continue to do this. This place needs to be shut  down!<//Review>

There's no clear direction as to which services are offered in which line. LINES...long lines, slow, and bad customer service. Avoid at all costs. Go to the hillsdale location for better customer service.<//Review>

I am glad it is still open. I feel like I'm part of history still being able to utilize the buliding.

It upsets me people on here complain about not being personally prepared. These are the kind of people I do not enjoy standing in line with.

Wanting somebody else to lick their own stamp. Waa waa waa

<Review>If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I've had problems with this post office for the last 3 years. Understaffed, slow, most of the employees are incompetent. They constantly misplace items. They never answer their phones so you always have to take time to show up. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ANWER THE PHONE?!!?!?!

This review is for a specific incident. I ordered Skyrim from Amazon with prime shipping. Delivery date was set for Saturday but since my office is closed (i live in a closed apartment complex). I knew they would try to deliver but either leave it at the post office for me to pick up Monday or just come back on Monday to deliver. Well, no. I guess, they came back on Sunday. Around 4:30 PM sunday afternoon, I get a notification from Amazon saying my package was delivered at 3:52 PM and LEFT ON THE PORCH. ARE YOU FOR REAL?! You're just going to leave my package outside in DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE?! HELLA STUPID. First time this has ever happened too. No other carrier would ever do that. So mad at these idiots.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I live in the Vendome neighborhood in San Jose, CA. Yesterday the mailman tossed my mail on the porch, despite having a mailbox very visible. The illegal conduct of this mailman is a reflection of how poorly the post office is run. I called today and had to wait almost 20 minutes for someone to come on the phone.  I spoke with Belen, a rude woman that appears to know nothing. Belen still wanted me to hold for someone else. This is an example of why the post office is in trouble financially; mail persons doing their own thing, no customer service and having people like Belen answering the phone.</Review>

This is the worst place. Unfortunately I have no where else to go because I have to pick up mail here. BELEN is a supervisor and insyead of getting behind the counter to help the line go faster she asks people why they are here and makes no difference. Totally inept.
I cannot stand walking into this place--long lines, poor service.<//text>

Courier came to front apartment area, left "sorry we missed you notice" and did not bother to knock on my door. Check online what time she came, it conflicted by the time the courier as she wrote it up as being here an hour early. On top of that, I was wide awake when she supposedly came, so it is obvious that some of the couriers are purely lazy. The last parcel i received before this, the courier knocked once , immediately stuck the notice on my door(immediately, did not wait even a moment) then left. By time I come out she is already running out the door. She complains that it will be a while for her to get the parcel, gives me a very dirty look, and tells me to put clothes on. Very unfriendly, rude and lazy courier. I live downtown san jose</text>

Everyone has gone to the Post Office and been upset afterwards.  This Post Office is just a little worse then your last experience. First you need to pay for parking (if you can find a spot). If you go over your time limit just a min or two longer on the meter, then congrats you just got a ticket for $40+!  If you have to come here after 4 PM, the post office will have significantly long lines.  Don’t bother trying to call them because half the time they don’t even pick up.  I called 4 different times one day, and they picked up on the fourth but then hung up on me. I've worked in business mail rooms for over 9 years, and I have seen bad post offices, but this is by far the worst.
update 8/10/17: called and said they were to busy to calculate a price so they took message.  So I went to the post office and...no line.<//review>

Ever since my boyfriend got a P.O. Box at this office the packages I send him have been lost and mishandled without fail.

When he went to retrieve his Valentine's package, the employees bickered in front of him about who had mistakenly forwarded his package elsewhere... Where? They didn't know. After multiple phone calls over the course of several weeks, USPS finally had to formally investigate the whereabouts of the package, and it wound up somewhere in SoCal…

On another occasion, his package WAS in fact at the office (a miracle), but the employee claimed it was "sitting in an unsorted pile" and he "didn't have time" to dig it out…

Bottom line: Run fast and far from this place. This office is an embarrassment to USPS name and a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT trust these people with your valuable mail.<//Review><user>105021996828856041695< /user>< user_name>

Most of staffs there are impolite and rude. The women work there doesn't even know how to calculate the size of package. My package and letters send out from there are always lost.<//review>

First visit to a US Post Office. No different to a UK post office. Arrived at opening time 0830 Monday after Thanksgiving and had completed my transaction by 0840. Only downside was that I had to use my credit card as they did not have 'change for a twenty'.< /Text>

Is there only one person working at this location? I have been trying to call this location for the last half hour and nobody answers the phone. The reason I am calling is because we haven't had anyone pick up or drop off mail TWICE this week.  This is ridiculous.<//Text>

Beautiful view! The meal was superb! Customer service was excellent! I cannot complain, first time here and hope to have many more. I greatly enjoyed dining here. I highly recommend to make reservations. Did not wait long to get seated.</Text>

Wedge salad is Amazing, added shrimp to it.  The house dressing is the best.  The view is Amazing too.  Was there on a clear spring night.  The lights were nice but a bit windy.  Can't wait to visit again on a hot summer night.  Perfect for dates.< /Review>

<Review>My parents came to town and took us to dinner here. The food and service was great, we had a blast, but sadly, I have to write this review since they have not responded to my mother about the extra 40-50 dollars worth of drinks they were charged for that we didn't order.

She has emailed, called, left messages, and NO contact has been made.

Hopefully they will see this and get back to her ASAP, as it’s been over a week.

UPDATE: she was finally reimbursed, so she is thankful for that.<//Review>< Response>

I really appreciated their COVID precautions! They explain what they're doing for their staff to ensure that they're healthy and the changes they've made for guests as well. They even have sealed silverware. The food and views were perfectly prepared, and our cocktails were well balanced❤️< /text>

<date>1621139960274<//date><Review>Awful experience before we even walked in the door, and it continued after we did. Made a reservation for two at 9 pm. Showed up and WAITED 20 minutes, to then be seated at a booth for up to 6 people behind the bar with zero view. Normally I'm not one to complain when the restaurant is full, but this place was nearly empty. I counted at least 6 open tables. Asked the hostess if we could get a table with any view, to be told there was no other availability and the kitchen was closing soon. No apology, she literally could have cared less and was very rude. Lost two customers for life.</Review>< Name>

I want to start by saying I loved the view. From the moment you walk in, you imagine you will have a great experience. We had a reservation, so when we walked to the main lobby we were told to wait a couple of minutes. After a few minutes a waiter came around and asked us to follow her. She asked if we were celebrating any special occasion, I told her "yes, anniversary", and she congratulated us. We followed her through the building to the main yard, and went all the way to the lower courtyard. My first impression was that the building was beautiful, the courtyard was even more pretty with all the pretty Valley lights and nice setting. However, the lower courtyard had plastic tables that really took away from the fancy dinner I expected. Regardless, we sat by one of the middle tables for 4, even though we were just 2, with a half view of the Valley and a very empty looking plastic table. We ordered 2 New York Steaks and a few drinks. After one hour of waiting, the nice waiter came around with our orders. We asked for well done steaks and got medium rare. My husband's steak was semi-cold. The mashed potatoes got my 5 stars, it was one of the best mashed potatoes I have ever had at a restaurant. The drinks were nice too, I had a mimosa and a margarita. Both were good, just very low on alcohol, but I was glad about that. For the very expensive dinner I was honestly expecting a grand occasion, but neither the food nor the location was up to my dreamed anniversary dinner.
Overall it was a nice experience, I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon. Next time, if I ever come back, I will try the main building and hopefully get my well done steaks.< /Review>

The Odyssey is obviously struggling post-pandemic.  None of the familiar staff was present and the overall impression during our visit was one of disorganization.  After being seated, it took 25 minutes for a server to appear.  We had to request menus, wine list, silverware and napkins. Bar was very mediocre - wine had to be returned, entrees were fine but the mushroom side dish was chewy, rubbery and inedible.  Starters and salads were served together and no itemized receipt was provided - just a total bill.<//text>

<rate>4< /rate><review>We just left this restaurant and are very happy that this was our choice for dinner while in town. The ambiance is worth it, hands down. Fabulous scenery, fantastic place for a great conversation and relaxed meal.
I decided on a 4 star review simply because I felt that for the prices, the food was bland. I ordered the Salmon that was on special and my husband ordered the Prime Rib that was on special. Both were bland and my husband even had to order steak sauce.
Servers were nice and welcoming.< /review>< Pictures>

Its a beautiful place overall but the service and food isn't near worth the money that you will pay. I wouldn't have even minded if the food wasn't amazing but the service if your paying so much should be incredibly better. The server forgot a meal and never even checked in after we got the food from a different waiter until after about a hour and then only realized he forgot something. Just disappointed in the experience but pretty place.< /text>

Made a reservation for Sunday night to have dinner with my husband for 7:15 PM, we were escorted to be seated at 7:45 PM, the hostess took us at the very end of the pathway where there was no more patio coverage and there were about four tables all tilted at 20 degrees angle due to the roots of the trees . Tables looked dirty , no table covers... used to come here a lot for the delicious food and view, we will not return anymore. Just walked out immediately. If I were there to have a lousy dinner I would’ve went to a fast food restaurant 🙅🏻‍♀️..  Nothing compares to Castaway in Burbank CA<//text>

Followed instructions to reserve a table for Easter. Called later to verify, nope!
Went back to grab final spot, would not allow me to add credit card.
Thnx for nothing Odyssey. I guess another will help me forget your lack of responsibility.
You’ve gone from one of my all time favorite down to, if it’s all that’s left.

So, it was Ok! Unfortunately not that WOW ! A Little pricey for what it is. Gimlets in a tumbler???? Guess a drink doesn't rate the right glass,  a martini glass! They charged for it well though! Dinner was ok but pricey beyond reasonable in my opinion. 4 people averaging a drink each, $110 each. Won't be back. Not that great.< /Text>

Great job at adapting at the new reality of the pandemic. Staff is polite and although the wait is long, they really try to make this a great experience.
I give it 3 stars because not all the food was great. Calamari gets a 10 but chicken burger was dry. Also, it took'em 10 minutes to get the maple syrup for the chicken and waffles... No good.

If you have plenty of time to wait and are patient, you won't be disappointed<//Text>

Great views, great food, great service. The only negative is that we had to wait 45 mins even with a reservation.</text>

<Review>We got married here 35 years ago.  The food was excellent. The service was very good. The outside dining experience was lovely.  We thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary dinner here during these challenging times.< /Review>< gmapID>

Bleh. All the food tasted pretty similar, and was wayyy overpriced. The meat wasn't any sort of quality. It's wedding catering through and through. The views are very nice though.</review>

A local landmark with a million dollar view. This is a nice upscale restaurant that doesn't disappoint. Their menu is filled classic steak and seafood fare and the bar is decent but it's really the view that you come here for.<//Review>

Food was good -well some of it, but I didn't think is was for the prices. However, I had agreed to go there to pick up food for Valentine's day as my husband loves prime rib. When ordering he requested to swap out his sides for a baked potato, so I asked the same for french fries. We drove from Hollywood to collect our special dinner however I realised I too had a baked potato. I didn't think much of it at first. I'm a pescatarian so I had ordered the salmon, very small compared to my husband's steak. Then I realised the potatos were covered in thick chunks of bacon, trying not to make a big deal of it as I didn't want to ruin my husband meal I removed the bacon. Unfortunately after undressing my potato I could see it had dark almost black marks through out the vegetable. Really very underwhelmed at the experience but at least my husband enjoyed his steak.< /text>

If fashion nova were a resturant this would be it. I know everyone raves about this place but honestly it's got strong Cheesecake Factory vibes, but with The Weeknd playing loudly in the background....consistently. ALSO ain't nobody's miso soup worth $15.<//text>

💯👏👍👌🍽🍽
The prime rib I got was good, but could have been a little bit better for the price.  Other than that the experience was fine.  The outside deck view is priceless....   The tables need to be better for large parties of 12 or more.
You had to put napkins under the legs to make them level out, for what you pay for at  that type of restaurant you shouldn't have to experience that.
Also came across very dirty silverware and had to let them know....
Staff are very friendly and the valet parking is Affordable.
Thanks again for a enjoyable experience!!!
I hope you take my recommendations to make the experience better for all... Ty</Review><resp>None</resp><user_name>David Donis<//user_name><Rate>5<//Rate><date>1555283905570< /date>< Pictures>

I'll start by saying this was my first time at the Odyssey and overall it was a nice experience, but there were some things that upset my guest. We were seated after a group that came in after us, but I was fine with that because the lovely hostess apologized for the longer wait time and sat us by the window with an excellent view. My meal was great, but my guest didn't have his prime rib cooked as ordered. Our server apologized and a new one was made. The service we received from our server was excellent and I will return in the future.</text>

<Review>Hello. I didn’t give the restaurant five stars bc the glasses I received my beer in were dirty. Not once but twice I received dirty glasses. I ordered overpriced tortilla soup that was more of a cup with one chunk of chicken with no tortilla strips or crackers. The Habanero Shrimp was overpriced. I think the order came with five battered shrimp. The burger looked like something I could have gotten through fast food joint. I expected more for the price. Now I remember why I hadn’t been in years.</Review>< pics>

Very poor service for the price you pay at this establishment.
You order pasta you have to ask for the Parmesan and pepper, it will take 10 min to get it.
Well done means rare.
So many errors and the place was not even busy.
Very sad will not repeat my visit.
Food was good.< /review>

Like no other. A fantastic view, modern design, and delicious food are all here at the oddysey. They have flat screen tvs and booths that overlook the breathtaking view. This is a truly amazing restraunt. They deserve more customers than they get. For some reason, not as many people come here now. I dont know why. Theres also a pond with fish near the entrance.</review>< date>

<Review>The website and google page says they are open 9:30am - 10pm and we reached at 3:00 to have quick meal and book a room for an event. The host said we are closed b/w 3 and 4 and you'll be seated at 4. I asked if we can still order something from your brunch menu or you are serving dinner now. The host said we can always prepare anything from the website menu on request, so we decided to wait for 45 mins. At 4:10 we were seated and the server refused to take the order as it had to be strictly from the dinner menu. After such an experience  we are for sure not going back to this place.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I came today to celebrate my friend’s 50th birthday. I have been helping his girlfriend with the planning and her experience with the manager Angeline was fantastic. In order to keep the guests meal cost at a price range everyone could afford we wanted to make sure we took advantage of their sunset menu which would accommodate all budgets. When we discovered that there was no way we could make it for the 5 o’clock cut off Angeline very graciously extended the menu cut off time for an additional hour to accommodate our party.

The view is incomparable and watching the sun go down as we Enjoyed the festivities really added to the special occasion.  Everyone at my table loved their meal.   equally happy with their meals. I had their prime rib and it Surpassed my expectations because it was absolutely flavorful and a PERFET medium rare - something I rarely get at other restaurants anymore. The waiter and service staff were very attentive yet non intrusive  Fantastic experience!!! I noticed when I first arrive because I accidentally walked into one of their attached event halls that day are very successful venue for all types of functions such as weddings and the quinceanera that I momentarily crashed. I am definitely coming back here!<//Review>

<text>Food here is absolutely AMAZING.  Staff is actually equally as amazing if not more so.  We had to unfortunately cancel our wedding here due to COVID-19.  Had it not been for the fact that we are relocating out of state immediately we would have loved to take Odyssey up on rescheduling the wedding for a later date.

Thankfully Melissa and team on the wedding side were amazing to work with and helped us come to a resolution that was fair and concise for both sides.  She went above and beyond to not only get us a resolution, but she was extremely timely about making sure that she followed up with us and kept us in the loop.

Thank you so much Melissa and I wish we could have had our wedding with you guys!  I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a wedding/event of any kind or just take your bf/gf out for a date!< /text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Name>

<review>Horrible customer service. Took a half hour and us getting up to get someone to come get our drink order.

Table turned like a lazy Susan.  Food came and we had to get up again to get someone to get us silverware. My soup was out 10 minutes before my husbands salad. He was still eating the salad when his main arrived.

The food. Very lack luster given the price tag. Very bland.  Save yourself some $ and get a steak at Fleming’s vs.  here. You’ll get better customer service and a higher quality of food.

Very disappointed.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Server had a party for 20 and the service was very slow. had to ask for refills and everything took forever ( boxes, missing dessert, refills and bills). Good was alright. I went to all for box at the bar and they dropped everything just to get the box from the other side of the restaurant. The view and the restaurant was beautiful. Definitely romantic especial in patio area.<//Review>

I have been going to this restaurant for many years, we liked the feel of  dining at a fine restaurant. But as of late I have seen some decline , they removed the table cloths. It now feels like you are dining at Denny's, lots of kids running around, just awful. I was a bit disappointed. The fish pond and potted plants are  badly needing some regular attention. It is now a family restaurant, I wouldn't consider  there for fine dining any more, but for lunch yes.<//Text>

Attended a wedding here. The venue is pretty and the food is nice, but the venue's liaison with the wedding host was not very organized. We were unhappy about the communication. We were told there would be a bridal changing room. There was none. Our bride and her bridesmaids had to change in the restroom. There was supposed to be another room made available for the tea ceremony that was arranged. There was none. The coordinator representing the venue who showed up didn't know what to tell us.< /text>

The view from there is amazing. I enjoy looking out to the valley. The staff was very polite and attentive to our requests. I didn't like that the sound from other rooms travels, and we couldn't hear well the speaker. It was about PrEP and the effectiveness to prevent HIV transmission.<//Review>

TERRIBLE SERVICE. We had the first reservation at 10am and didn’t get our food until 12pm and finally finished at 1pm. 3 HOURS!! We bought bottomless mimosas and got 1 every (maybe) 45mins. I pushed all of the finished glasses to the end of the table so maybe another worker would see them. We “used” to come here often and usually had around a $500 tab but this is unfortunately our last time. Their loss.< /Text>

Odyssey is a fun restaurant with a great view.  The actual restaurant part of the property lines the front window over looking the valley.  It is very similar to the pre-renovated castaway's in Burbank if you've ever been there.  We had the salmon, filet mignon, and the prime rib.  The salmon was excellent, but both the filet and prime rib were overcooked and under seasoned.  They give lots of bread while you wait which is nice but the butter is unsalted so grab that salt shaker.  All of their potatoe sides were very good.  Their other sides weren't as good.  They have a non-alcoholic drink with lemonade and strawberry that was awesome.  Overall it was a little pricey for the quality of food and the inside is looking a little older, but it is in a great location with a pretty decent array of items on the menu.  I would go again.</Text>

Our group went there for the Mother's Day buffet.  High quality foods including roast beef spare ribs and crab legs.  Extensive variety to choose from and lines were not very long. Desserts went on forever.  Healthy options and mimosas were included.  Buffet style format when we were there for Mother's Day.  Friendly service and easy parking.  Good view over the San Fernando valley from the north side of the valley.  Easy access to the San Diego freeway.  We were surprised at the relatively low cost of final bill given the wide selection of quality foods, free parking and excellent service.  Will be there next year for Mother's Day.<//review>

<review>I attended my cousin's wedding here and was very impressed with the venue. I know it's been here for such a long time, but this was my first visit. It's absolutely gorgeous! The food served was very good and I'm interested in returning to the restaurant to try other menu items. The service in the banquet room was great.<//review>< GmapID>

<review>The food and view are amazing. All 5 of us were happy with our meals. The claim chowder had an interesting twist with bacon bits included, both the swordfish and salmon had great tasting sauces. There were few veggies on these plates. The beef meals had more veggies, broccoli and carrots.
Beautiful view of the San Fernando  Valley at sunset.< /review><resp>None</resp><Rate>5< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

The restaurant is delightful. The view is very beautiful with an easy ride up. Lots of parking. There is a fireplace in the lobby which was nice today, as it was chilly. The hostess seated Us by a window with a beautiful view. Service was prompt. There was an excellent menu with a lot of good choices.</Text>

I enjoyed the continental breakfast and the sweets afterward. I was there for a company training. It was an all day event. 8:30am to 5pm.<//Review>< Pics>

Great views of the valley, nice ambiance, good service and all the brunch you can think of. The establishment could do with a re-fresh. But other than that, it's a great brunch to hang out with friends.< /Review>

Although they were very busy they got us a table and were very thoughtful. Hostess (Shannon) was so busy due to holiday that it was difficult to give to much attention to anyone table but She found a way. Thank you.<//Review>

My wife's salmon was excellent but her sides were kinda bland. The organic Chicken plate was very small and kinda dry.   I was so hungry afterwards. The bill  was150. Not worth it. I would recommend CF kitchen in Granada hills is way better. No stupid view but you get alot of gourmet food for a great price plus great fast service.</review>< pictures>

<review>We attended a wedding reception here on a Saturday recently. We were in a banquet room and had access to the buffet brunch in the main seating area. It grieves me to say that the food was less than mediocre and in some cases not edible. As we were guests at the wedding reception we did not complain about the food but we were sorely disappointed. Also halfway into our event another event began celebrating next to us and the walls are so thin that the mariachi band and the noise overshadowed and overpowered our entire afternoon. Nobody could hear our music or the people on the microphone and it was extremely frustrating. Obviously we enjoyed ourselves because we were with our friends celebrating loved ones nuptials but the restaurant left a lot to be desired. I can say however that the service was excellent. Our waiter was extremely attentive and quick with our request for drinks and cleaned up immediately after and was extremely charming. I probably would not go back to this restaurant in the future.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>The restaurant is delightful. The view is very beautiful with an easy ride up. Lots of parking. There is a fireplace in the lobby which was nice today, as it was chilly. The hostess seated Us by a window with a beautiful view. Service was prompt. There was an excellent menu with a lot of good choices. I had an excellent salad with a chicken pie yard which was very good, tasty and perfectly cooked. My companions were also very happy with their meals. Service was attentive as well. I will definitely return.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>4 Stars for the beautiful views and for the restaurant. Unfortunately no stars for the service. Please, improve your service if you want your customers to return. I would suggest adding a couple of extra servers especially on busy weekends.< /review>< pictures>

Charge what you want for the food, I was the one who agreed to the pricing by ordering the food. Now that I know that it takes 1.5 hours to get a side of fries and our food... I wont be back. In fact, I'll warn others. BTW- the waiter was great, the food equivalent to that from a mall food court.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I called in a few days a go and made a reservation for 2 for Saturday 1/18 evening. We showed up for our reservation and checked in with the hostess. We were  ready to enjoy a good dinner but they made us wait. 30 minute passed  before I went up and talked to the hostess and asked about our reservations. We were told that our table wasn't ready and that they were still taking earlier reservations. What's was the point of making a reservation? I know this restaurant get full but come on. It's not my problem that The Odyssey gets full but if someone has a reservation accommodate it ASAP. We left and went to El President down the street and was seated right away.</text>

Excellent service, delicious food, friendly staff. However, due to a weekend day couldn't get the window seats had to sit in a booth with very little light. Must add light to this booth area so patrons can read menu easily. Awesome desserts selection. Very impressive overall experience.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Always a great place for an entertaining dinner and great views of the North San Fernando Valley, looking south from the mountains. I met a bunch of friends when I was there two weeks ago and we had an excellent time. Food was very good and the views were outstanding. Although they've been there for many many years, it's always well kept and during the day there's plenty of seating available. Parking is close by and on ground level.</Review>< pics>

The restaurant is expensive but they really have good food. I’ve also been here for a few weddings and it is a great venue to have them. The amount of effort they put on the little details is amazing. The view is also freaking awesome!<//text>

Would like to recommend the management a better accommodations for people with disability.  There was a woman who fell down the 3 steps from the buffet area to her table last Saturday, 9/15/19.  The ramp was way to the back and when you are already having problem with mobility, using a cane or a senior, you don't need to walk a long way to the ramp while carrying your plate.  There were many seniors  dining that day, some with canes.  It's common sense that handicapped parking brings you closer to the entrance, yet inside the dining area there was no thought giving to the seniors or people with handicapped.  Should have a ramp to the middle.  Hoping the management will see this and correct the situation.</text>

Extremely slow service, even for water and bread, which is available only by request, which we made promptly.
Restaurant was almost deserted, at lunchtime. View was lovely and food was quite tasty, ONCE we received it, but they are relying too heavily on their view. Service makes the experience.
We also miss their salad bar.< /Text>

Amazing view of San Fernando Valley, particularly at night.  Located just west of 405 Fwy and north of 118 Fwy.  Sunday brunch is $49, but a wide variety of choices and everything you can imagine from beef, sea food, fruits, salads, omelet bar, deserts, beverages.  Staff is OK.  Ambience is very nice.  Enjoyable to just sit outside near fire pit and talk.  Has valet parking, but also plenty of self parking.</Text>

The food was very good, the view at the window was great and the service we received was excellent. They were even able to fix the air conditioning that was blowing too strongly on our table.  It's definitely a place I would revisit. I ordered the lamb and it was cooked nicely and the gravy tasted great. The baked potato was also perfectly cooked. Not too soft and overcooked like many places do.< /review>

Amazing place. Phenomenal view. Incredible dessert. Easy reservations.
The calamari was hailed as one of the best. I got it, expecting only calamari... But no, there are actually LITTLE TINY BABY WHOLE SQUIDS, along with the standard calamari. they should state that on the menu. Seeing those little babies, deep fried in batter basically made me sick and ashamed. No one wants to be reminded they're hurting something by eating!! I didn't eat those, obviously.
Our servers were.....just okay...they seemed a little pre occupied and inattentive for my taste as it took 15 minutes until we were able to order. Maybe that one server had a bad day. No matter though, still a five star place, hands down.
It's truly eco friendly that they grow all their own produce on the mountain that the restaurant is on top of!</text>

I had a very sad incident there 2xs with the food and customer service. I'm done with this place!!! They told me they had gluten free food and when i got there they said they couldnt accomodate and one time waited for the chef to ask him something, and waited 40 mins so he could come out of the kitchen. Bad customer service!!< /Review>

We went for our holiday party. Very crazy busy but the food was very good. Lunch buffet. They don't always offer that but they had it for the holiday season. Great choices, quality food.< /review>

I honestly tried this place a couple of times before I did this review.  This place has been slowly declining year by year and it is a true disappointment. Beautiful views but awful food. So this review is regarding my recent visit on Wednesday, December 12 for the buffet lunch. Now, this brunch was $32 all you can eat and $4.50 for a soda. The first problem was the food was overcooked and dry, especially the meats. Flavor was weak and the taste was bland. The next issue was it was all you can eat, but they did not refill the food. I was basically eating leftovers! What was ridiculous was the crabs, there were only small scraps when I got there, so I decided to ask the server if there will be more crabs. The gentleman took the tray and said he will bring some more out, half an hour later, NOTHING! As for the clam chowder, the pot was completely sizzling with the dry remains in it. Now the desert I was expecting to be at least decent, but it was not! Again nothing was left and nor did they think they should put more out. Now for the chocolate roll log cake, there were little flies all over it. YUCK! I was there to celebrate an achievement but unfortunately, we picked the wrong place to celebrate. My family was going to do the Christmas brunch here, but due to the last visit, my husband changed the venue. True waste of money.< /Text>

I totally love this place. We come here for special occasions, which is often. Customer service is top notch. We have been going to the Odyssey for some time. We are never disappointed. Sunday morning Brunch is by far the best time to go.... Go... You will love it too...< /Text>

We were here for a wedding Saturday June 15th.  Nice setting for the ceremony and the halls are right next to that area, so it's a convenient setting.  The ballroom with the existing shear fabric and lights are  very decorative and a nice touch to any event.  The food was okay, I'm sure when making 100 dishes it's not as good as when you just order a meal in the restaurant side, it was just a tad dry, the chicken and the steak.  Veggies and the mashed potatoes were delicious and the sourdough bread was warm when it came out.  All the servers were friendly, everything was served very quickly.  I would go here again!< /text>

i Was going to write about how dirty the bar was and that I saw 4 couples go to bar and leave because it was dirty and bar tender was to busy on his cell and cleaning one class, but I’m not... this restaurant has a great view and pretty dining area, the staff just need to leave their phones in the back.  Food was just ok the prime rib was over cooked and had to ask for a steak knife twice..... I will try again hoping to see better service .... for those reading this I did tip well20% hope they see there are nice people who just want what they ordered and treat like a guest< /review>

My wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary at the Odessy Thursday night and are so happy we did.
Walking in was breathtaking....the view of the city lights set the stage. We were greeted kindly by the hostess and seated immediately, which was great because the place was packed with people. Our server Donnie was incredible. He was professional and personnel and made us feel special. He made many recommendations which we went with. We started with mojitos which were great but dove into a sampler plate with prime rib tacos and calamari that was so tasty. Donnie recommended the salmon for my wife and a rib eye for myself as I was hungry. The wines he paired were perfect and the entrees were some of the best we have ever had.
Five stars to the Odessy......we will see you for the buffet on Sunday. It's our new spot< /text>

Sunday brunch has a little something for everyone. Champagne flows freely ... servers are friendly and attentive. Plenty of parking. Great views of the valley... photo ops. I'd suggest checking it out if you've never been. They also do great holiday buffets.</Text>

A group of us, all ladies had brunch at the Odyssey today and I was really really disappointed. The food was terrible, service not so good but more importantly,  they had "flies" in the restaurant.  I've gone there for many years in the past and it was always great, good food and many choices.  I don't know what have happened but this for sure will be my last time.</Review>

< Review>
Has a good experience there.  Would have rated this place a 5 star except for the service.  Went for Sunday brunch.  Food 5☆, cleanliness 5☆, view 5☆, but service 2☆.  We were left on our own quite a bit with dirty plates not collected.  This was a $50 brunch.  I expected my plates collected so I had space for my next plate.  I would try one more time in case it was a fluke, but was  surprised at the service.< /Review>

<user>111157362425496784054</user><text>This a must visit at some point if you live in the valley area. The views are absolutely gorgeous. Personally I prefer the bar area over the sit down restaurant or the patio. It is a great place to head to right before sunset so you get the sunset and the gorgeous twinkle of the valley. On a clear day you can see ridiculously far. I have also attended a number of events here and the food/organization of the event was great. It is not he newest/more over the top glamorous venue but it is solid, established and there won't be surprises here. I have been here in Jean and in formal attire and the venue has the ability to morph depending on the occasion.< /text><Time>1559228188368</Time><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c29011ba9d643d:0xa5ea6e4db9be3f1e< /gmapID><Rate>4<//Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Name>

For as many times we have been to dinner here, I was very disappointed with the service we got on Sunday.
1. The bread we got was a small basket serving,  while the other tables got bigger baskets. There were 6 one-inch thin (maybe thinner) slices. The tables around us got bigger slices.
2. I ordered the 3 course meal but got the 1st course, which is the appetizer,  at the same time we got our dinner.
3. Our dinner came at the same time as the 2 party table behind us. We got there at least 20 minutes before them.
4. Our server was more attentive  to the bigger party.
Very disappointing.<//Review>

<Text>I was brought to Odyssey for a surprise birthday brunch. There was a reservation for 2, but upon arrival, the greeter couldn't find it. However, the greeter made things work and we were seated within 10 minutes.

I took a gander around the buffet before I piled up. There were a lot of options ranging from sushi to fresh seafood (clams, crab legs, and shrimp) to meat to breakfast items. Basically, there's something for everyone. My favorites included the breakfast potatoes and the clams. There was even a custom-made omelet bar!

After all that eating, how could I not make more room for dessert?! Lots of varieties of desserts, but my favorite was the make your own chocolate covered strawberries/pineapples/etc station.

There's a staff member that takes complimentary photos, prints on the spot, and the option to buy the bigger size.

Overall, I had a great birthday brunch experience here and I hope I can come back at night time to take in the beautiful skyline view.< /Text><rate>4</rate></record>

Up scale prices... Though I like their Bloody Mary more than any I've ever had before.
During this recent vist... I tried Creme Brulee for the first time in my life... And it was FANTASTIC! Who knew!
Final word... I hosted a family party there a few months ago. When we arrived,  the manager informed me that he changed the menu.  At first, I was naturally frustrated and disappointed.
But the manager stepped up and accommodated every guest request flawlessly.
He made all my guest feel like royalty.  It was so nice to watch everyone have such a great time.
A very relaxing and enjoyable place to dine. Especially for large groups!< /review>

<Text>Yikes. The food was disgusting. How do you mess up pancakes??? They tasted like baking soda and raw flour. The "Salmon Benedict" was barely edible. And the place is not cheap. Such a shame. Beautiful setting, horrid food.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmap_id>

Nice evening,  the menu has changed a bit. But always enjoy the view and slowing down to a nice meal.  But it's not Maestros or Cut if that's what your expectations are.  But Brunch is always nice but again always busy too.< /Text>

Went to a brunch. Overall a good place. I think that the price a bit high for the level of what you get. Ask for a place near a window. Sometime there is a nice view of the valley.</Review>

Best thing about this place were my glasses of La Crema chardonnay and the view. Everything else sucked. Including the waiter. Chris was slow, sloppy, and served our expensive dishes with empty appetizer dishes hanging out on the edge of the table. Disappointing! CASTAWAY in Burbank is where you’ll find quality service and dishes. The view is spectacular.  Check it out!</review>

Great bar experience. Beautiful location. Perfect for a friendly meetup to cool down after work.  Two recent visits.  Both times friendly servers made us glad we were there. The big surprise was the quality of the appetizers. Superb. I can't wait to go back and have the shrimp again.<//text>

When you to the patio wedding yo have to go down to the patio thrue the stairs.
And when you leave you have to leave from the back of the belding  you have to walk like a block to you get to your car.

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>The 4th of July buffet was the worst buffet I have ever experienced.  Hometown Buffet’s food is much better and that isn’t saying too much.

When we arrived, of the meager choices, many of the food offerings were empty and not replenished.  In addition, we were charged almost $10 for 2 sodas that should have been included in the price.

I have been going to the Odyssey for many years.  In the past, the food has been good to excellent.  The buffets were pretty good, especially for New Years and Christmas.

I hope this isn’t a trend in order to save money on food expense.  You have great building with a spectacular view of the San Fernando Valley but one can’t count on a good eating experience there</Text>< pics>

<Review>The Odyssey Restaurant is an amazing spot, it should be!  The restaurant is very hipster and has a dark lit atmosphere.  To eat here will set you back about an hour or so wait, even with a reservation, however we go really lucky to find a spot at the bar and got seating almost immediately, which we later passed on to someone else who did the same thing.  The shank is a must here as well as the roasted cauliflower.  Their renowned top chef really knows how to make a great dish.  Had a great experience here and recommend to any local or tourist.<//Review>< Time>

The view is absolutely amazing. The entire staff needs to be fired. There were 5 customers in the restaurant and it took forever to get a drink. Let’s not mention that my food came to the table cold.  Do not ask for a table outside. The staff will definitely forget that you’re out there.  The food isn’t so bad but the staff is the laziest I’ve ever seen.</Text>

Great view. Food was decent.  Service lacked experience.

The server charged me the wrong price.  Then lost my credit card and tried to give me some one else's credit card.  It turns out she dropped my credit card on the floor, but she never apologized.<//review>

This is a restaurant based upon the view of the san fernando valley. Now, you won't see all 26 sq mi, but you can definitely see quite a bit. The service is ok. How pleasurable of a time you have Depends on the company you are having your meal with. Food is decent. Nothing to scream to the heavens about.< /Text>

< review>
It was an awesome brunch with different kind of food from different ethnic backgrounds & all you could drink from coffee, ice tea, water, & more. Price is reasonable..the waitress ( Nancy) was awesome server! We love her. Thank you for making the 2 birthday celebrations for our Sisters in CHRIST awesome!!!</review>

The Odyssey is a hilltop restaurant and banquet hall that has excellent service by its staff. The food is excellent, the prices are excellent, and the views to the Valley are excellent.  I love hosting my big parties and conferences here, it's actually selected by my guests every year.<//text>

The place was EMPTY AF. The server was slow AF, physically and mentally. I only tipped that man 1 dollar. I ALWAYS tip 10 or more regardless of the cost if the server performs their duties with a smile and steadfast demeanor. My drink remained empty for several minutes as we waited for our food. I understand that serving food can be hectic. But, it was at the time of day where it was not busy at all. There were maybe, 10 people in there. Then, the guy couldn't understand why i gave him ONLY a dollar. The food was terrible. I'll give it a try again if my friends suggest it. But, i will NEVER go by myself.< /text>

Well what can I say..? The servers are always nice but, every single time I go here it's a disappointment. The food was okay. Not really worth the price we paid. I go back once in a while in hopes they've improved but, to no avail. 😐
Will i go again? Yes..not of my own accord.
Thumbs down.  Sorry Odyssey.< /review>

<Review>Went to the restaurant there after a company event was over to enjoy some drinks and food with co-workers but food took forever to get to us and incorrectly as well almost 3 hours of waiting in total. Some of us left without even seeing their food arrive ever. Waitress was polite and awesome the whole time at least and the food we got eventually was good. I am returning some day for another company gathering this year, and I hope this was just one of those bad days. We shall see on the next visit, looking forward to giving this place it's 5 stars it brags about.<//Review>< Resp>

< Review>
I went here in highschool on a bunch of acid. It was hella trippy, I thought it was the mothetland. Where baby Jesus was born. Although I don't believe in the story. It seemed to fit the odyssey at the time. I'll be back. Probably not on acid.  Just to eat. The food looked great. Just wasn't in any state to eat on my first trip to the great restaurant with the amazing view.< /Review>

Food was okay (barely) but the fries were the best I've ever eaten. The place looks worn and it feels gloomy. Maybe I'll come back, but I'll seat outside in the patio to see the city lights and just eat fries.</review>

Terrible. 30 minutes to get a glass of water. $245 for a cold steak, burned lobster(which was surprisingly still cold), and under done risotto. Don't bother calling the GM brittney player her mail box was full ( no doubt filled with complaints.) Will do my best to warn everybody I know.</Text>

Maybe I'm too discriminating when it comes to restaurants but the prices are way to high for what you get, there drinks seem to be a bit watered down, and the food is just mediocre. Service was good.</Review>

<Review>We were a group of 18 for a 40 th Birthday of one of  our close family member.Three cousins with their families attended the Party.
We had a good time as the place is spacious and the views from the restaurant was awesome.
The menu was a good spread of Italian, American and Chinese popular dishes.Group of 5 kids had a great time.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c29011ba9d643d:0xa5ea6e4db9be3f1e< /gmap_id></record>

Well, the food general within a reasonable price. But management and services are poor. We ordered a menu but they failed to bring us the salad. After many times we were asking, the restaurant paid no attention to us. It was some that I've not experienced in other places. Never. The location of restaurant is good. We indeed could see the landscape of city.< /review>

My husband and I had our first date here 33 years ago. Being back in town on a visit,  we thought we would relive the moment. Much of it was like we remembered. I was disappointed however to learn that they no longer offer their salad bar (only the Sunday brunch hours).  And the coconut fried shrimp I used to get was no longer on the menu,  but they serve a grilled polynesian shrimp that was equally as good. They are celebrating their 60th anniversary with a special throw back menu for the month of October (and maybe November).  The food was great and our server was very sweet. We were glad they still have the fire pits on the back patio where we always enjoyed an after dinner drink and watched the city lights. We were also treated to a spectacular lighting show!  I chose to give a 4 star instead of 5 because of the lack of the salad bar,  especially on a Friday night.<//Text>

Beautiful view, delicious food, and spot-on service. Colton was our waiter this evening and everything was top notch. The Prix fixe menu right now is an incredible deal, so get in soon to take advantage of it!<//review>

The bread and pesto is amazing. Artichoke dip was really good as well as the spare ribs. Only bad thing is I asked for my burger medium and it was almost well done.</text>

<review>I've been a fan of the Odyssey's Sunday Brunch for years. There's no better way to prime a lazy Sunday morning than eating with friends, family or parents. The serving staff is always courteous and attentive, the food is varied and savory, and the view is unparalleled. It's well worth the drive out.

When looking at venues for a small (<100 guests) wedding, I was constantly stumped by overblown prices at other locales. The Odyssey's special events planners presented to me a package that was quite simply unmatchable. They included a buffet-style dinner with remarkable food and a dessert cart with coffee and pastries towards the evening's end, at a fraction of the cost that other venues had presented to me. My wife and I sprang for an open bar and a chocolate fountain for a little more. Even then, the price was spectacular. The Odyssey's staff was very easy to work with, and the day of the event they provided our guests with matchless service. The food was so well received that my guests still -- 3 years after the event-- rave about their meal and drinks that night.

Consider the Odyssey for your next big event. You won't be disappointed!<//review>< Pics>

<Date>1474553168101< /Date><rating>3</rating><Text>This used to be a fine restaurant. Last night I took my wife, and we found the experience to be very mediocre. We had the fillet mignon,  which I don't mind paying a high price for if it's really great. It was definitely not worth the $37 per plate. It was good, but not memorable. The last fillet I had at Black Angus was far superior. The service was slow, our waiter was working hard but I felt that he had been given too many tables.  Which was  interesting since there weren't that many customers in the restaurant.  Still the ambience of the  restaurant is nice,  though it's starting to look out of date. Nice outside view if you ignore the power plant nearby (not as much of an eyesore after dark).
I would love to see this place return to its former prestige.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
My wife and I dined here yesterday for the first time to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. The location of the restaurant was on a hilltop which provided some great views of the SF valley. We started out seated on the patio, amazing view of the valley @ 530. Didn't last long as clusters of flying pests/bugs around our table didn't allow us to enjoy the ambience of dining outside. The hostess gladly moved us to a table inside.

Our server Shannon took great care of us! I ordered the filet mignon/lobster tail while my wife had the Polynesian shrimp/lobster tail. The wild berry mojito was excellent!  Our only complaint was that the kitchen forgot my wife's lobster tail with her entree & the food didn't come out very hot. More on the lukewarm side. My wife finished her meal before her lobster tail finally arrived. That was disappointing. She still enjoyed her lobster tail & glass of wine. The manager apologized for the lateness of the lobster tail, comp'd it along with our drinks & gave us a dessert as well.

We'll be back to dine here. Hopefully issues with the kitchen will be a thing of the past. Our server Shannon was great! Thank you Shannon!</Review>

Food and service was the worst.  Slow and the girl our server needs to brush or grab her hair up. Hair all over the place not a good impression.<//review>

The food was excellent however we were seated near a cooking station and we were very hot. Turning the air conditioning up could have helped. We were a large group and everyone was uncomfortable.< /Review>

<review>Came for a large birthday party. We were sat outdoors. The table tops were all wobbly. Not due to uneven ground, but due to the tops themselves coming loose from the base.
Halfway through our dining experience the two tables next to us stood up to leave. They knocked over glasses due to the loose tables. 2 glasses broke on the ground. Those 2 tables stayed dirty with dishes and champagne bottles on them, and the broken glass stayed on the ground for the rest of the night. While walking around the area, we had to kick the glass under the table to keep people from stepping on it.
While waiting for service several people got up for smoke breaks. As we walked around we noticed Gatorade bottles, glasses, cups, rags, napkins, on the walkways and in the bushes.
After STILL not receiving service our birthday girl got up TWICE to go find a waitress. When we finally ordered, the waitress took our orders on a piece of folded up, used, printer paper. Not even proper tickets.
3 people ordered salads, nothing more. Those salads came out LONG before anyone else's food, so they just sat there waiting for everyone else to get their food. Once everyone finally got their food I was almost finished with my plate when one person at the end of the table finally got his plate that had been forgotten.
After dinner, several us had to go to the front desk 2 and 3 times to try and get a server to bring our check. We asked for our check while the sun was still up, we didn't leave until well after the sun was down.
If you're looking for a clean atmosphere, with reliable service, and good food for the price. Go to Denny's. I'm not kidding. I'd have rather.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The restaurant may have a beautiful view but that's about it. The staff take forever to help you because half the time they are too busy chit chatting amongst themselves.  After an hour of placing our orders, we are still currently waiting for our drinks to be refilled. The food is overpriced and not worth the wait. If you order a cocktail don't be surprised if its missing half the ingredients listed on the menu. Very deceiving. Regret coming here. I don't know how they're still in business with such poor service.< /text>

<review>I used to go to this place many years ago and it was a great place to celebrate birthdays. this time I went with four of my friends to celebrate my best friend's birthday and it was such a disappointment. two guys ordered ravioli, the birthday girl order Polynesian shrimps when the food arrived we were so shocked to see sucha small portions the Polynesian shrimp came with 4 shrimps and a little bit of white rice, $29. the ravioli came with five pieces I don't know how these people can charge so much for such little portions of food I was very disappointed and I will never go back to that place the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the lady who served us was really nice.</review></record></dataset><record>

If your looking for a place with a view, look no further. The staff is nice and the food is good. Clean restrooms. Bring a few extra bucks as it can be a bit pricey .</text>

If you live nearby, it's a great spot to get up and above things and enjoy a nice dinner or drink.  The outdoor patio is kid friendly and they have a happy hour, with some tasty food items.<//review>

The view is beautiful but the service is terrible. Maybe they're just understaffed but we waited like 20 or more minutes just to get a drink(!!!)we actually almost left thinking we will never get anything. Then we waited  another 10 min or so to order our food then again waited  forever to get it. We never got any water. Beautiful place but don't come here hungry or thirsty.< /text>

Cedar plank salmon delicious. Found a hair in salad....waiter brought a new salad, but offered nothing else. Most restaurants will offer a free app or dessert to make up for it. Very expensive restaurant...expected better customer service.</Text>

< Review>
It was my wife’s Bday last night on Friday. We were planning to visit Odyssey for a while, finally opportunity became a reality:) We live 5 min away from this joint. So, 3 adults and 3 kids... I got the reservation for 8:30 pm. We were few min early. This place was half empty.
Very old looking restaurant, reminded me of Yamashiro in Hollywood. Pretty much a branch muncher. We sat down, after half an hour they brought us 4 pieces of bread with a butter and lemonade for kids. Tap water was so disgusting, my wife asked me to bring our water bottle from the car. We ordered few dishes from the limited to nothing menu, and started to wait for our food:) pretty much everyone else in a restaurant was doing the same thing. Some tables I saw kids trying to fall asleep on their chairs, but we tried to cheer up each other for the upcoming delicatessens:))) around 10:30 pm food was served.... my daughter was crying, she was so hungry, waiting for macaroni and cheese.
She got her two table spoons of yellow mess called macaroni. Very cheerful waiter was trying so hard to make it fun.
We finished our meals and waited another half and hour for deserts. Half of my short ribs was a plain fat, which I successfully spitted back on my plate. The intimate atmosphere requires everyone to use their phones flashlight in order to read the menus. We got few boxes to go and headed home. I spend all night in the bathroom trying to figure out whether I want to puke or do numb 2 :) strong diarrhea helped me to get rid of the goodies I had last night. Another word, I had food poisoned myself in that dump called Odyssey. My wife and all the kids had pretty much the same reaction. We woke up this morning feeling really bad and dissatisfied.
I’m planning to call the restaurant manager and get my $$$ back or dispute my c/c charge.
My wife’s Bday was completely ruined.
I won’t recommend to anybody to ever visit this hole so called Odyssey restaurant.
Spend your hard earned $$$ somewhere else!!!!< /Review>

Awful communication between staff. I had my wedding reception here and after several days of planning the person we met with wasn’t there...Melissa. So we had some random person do the best he could but wasn’t his fault. Too many chefs in a kitchen. Wanted to express my disappointment on the mistakes they made. Directed to Melissa Pollack. She sadly ignores my calls and emails. I know. This seems hard to grasp that the director could not carve out time to return calls and emails aimce our schedules did not coordinate and she’s hardly there. So they don’t care about their customers satisfaction. Food poor, overcharged us, didn’t follow contract, no follow through, took advantage of my elderly parents and asked for their credit card when we had one on file, charges ya for drinks we didn’t approve on and on I could go. Also placed my vendor by their outside door so forget what you want. And my guest left our room. Go figure. Thanks for listening to your customers. But Melissa Pollack is the director and yet no time for any of our concerns. Skip this one because you will not be happy and I don’t like that they take advantage of elderly senior people and do not follow through on their promise. Plus no personalized attention. Over promise under deliver</text>

<text>I had looked forward to eating here for so long.  Very disappointed by the food quality and selection.  There was a dish made of frozen tater tots.  The prime rib was ice cold, and tasteless.  The salad bar had  few actual salad options and the lettuce was wilted.  The atmosphere was like a Denny's with noisy kids, sloppy customers, not one was dressed up, the Christmas music was blaring.  The best part was the staff was very friendly!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I've not been here in a couple of years. Came for New Years Brunch. The furniture in the dining room shows its age, as does a majority of the facility. The chairs could use to be refinished,  and the filthy seat fabric needs changed. Carpets are old, and if you're with someone who has mobility issues, it's a challenge as this place was built pre ADA and seems not to have been updated to be in compliance. Food was good, might be nice during the brunch to offer a set menu choice or two as well for those who would like less than a full brunch.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This was honestly one of the best eating experiences I've ever had. They had so many options and so much food not to mention bottomless mimosas (and when I say bottomless I mean the waiter or waitress is constantly filling it before you get the chance to finish it). They have a waffle station as well as an omelet and pasta station where they make it for you fresh. They also have fresh oysters and shrimp as well. staff is extremely friendly and attentive whether they're you're server or not. The wait for the Sunday brunch was extremely reasonable (20 minutes with no reservation). Definitely will be coming back here to celebrate another anniversary. Definitely an enjoyable eating experience whether you're with your spouse or your family.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c29011ba9d643d:0xa5ea6e4db9be3f1e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>With impressive views across LA, Odyssey  woo'd us visually. The food was good but our vegetables were essentially raw and the waiting staff needed  reminding of our requests on multiple occasions.  I would give it a second chance though - perhaps with different menu choices!< /review>< Rate>

<Text>My family of 30ppl held a surprise birthday brunch for our mother the Sunday before Christmas. Aside from the usual Sunday brunch crowd, there were numerous special events just like ours going on. The staff not only provided exemplary service, they wrangled flower and cake deliveries, oddball special requests, champagne toast and smoothed out a couple of hiccups. All done with grace and smiles. The food was abundant and delicious and the views, spectacular. But the way the staff cared for my mother on one of the busiest days of the  year sealed the deal.</Text>< pics>

<review>This was the worst time I have ever had. Our resveration was at 7:15pm. We arrived at 7pm. Was told would seat us closer to resveration time. 50 mins later we where given a table that was terrible.  I asked for a window table and they said they didn't have one. I saw one and asked when we where seated and the hostess told me someone had reserved it. I thought to myself I made this resveration weeks ago and asked for a window table. So we sat down and when they seated the table it was the people who walked in. No reservations and they where told they would have to wait until after 8pm. But no they where seated literally after us. The Hostess could not get things right. 50 min wait even with resverations. Not right. We ordered. Food took forever. Cheese plate only had 2 pieces of bread and several pieces of cheese. We ordered drinks and waiter came back said out of coke. So we ordered lemonaid. The cream brulee was terrible. We received the bill it was wrong. Was over charged. The waiter charged for the coke even though we got lemonade. The price is different from coke to lemonade. Tols the waiter and he stated same price. I told him no look at bill. I told him to forget it. I gave him a tip because. I will never go back took 3 hours for the whole dinner. It was the worst time I have ever had at dinner. Never again.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Text>Very bad service, were sitted at 8pm no one approached us until 8:30, during that half hour gap we where waving for service every time waiter will pass, they wouldn't even look in our direction, which is not acceptable at all,  the table was dusty and wasn't bother to be cleaned. then waiter approached us and his excuse was didn't see us, then he took the order, which we had ordered the drink and appetizer ,it came on time, but it took them 5 minutes to bring the utensils,  then it took them hour and half to bring our dinner, which was cold, my husbands  prime steak was raw, we asked to recook, we found out later that the waiter had left it on the bar counter for about half hour and not gave it to the cook to recook, then manager came over to bring shrimp sauce we had ordered, i asked her for paper napkins, never got any,  we saw our group of friends also came, there reservation was 8:30 they were sitted at 9,   we had requested to the waiter to set their tables with us, by the time they arranged that we pulled the tables and chairs ourselves for them to sit with us. we where siting outside, but when they had requested to sit out site, restaurant answered them as they don't have space, it was a Thursday  night, the restaurant was not busy, it was actually empty with the horrible service, I wouldn't visit this place again, If I have to it will be for the view and just to have cocktail.
Either more waiters need to be hired or the whole staff needs to be changed,  this place was very high class back in the days, about 10-15 years ago, we would go more often to celebrate all our occasions. I will not even give one star for this, but I guess without choosing a star it doesn't let you by pass the screen .<//Text><Name>Y N</Name></record>

<user_name>Mark Salinas<//user_name><Time>1545801491717</Time><Rating>3<//Rating><Text>Ok, where do I start? Well..we decided to make a reservation at the Odyssey for a Christmas Eve meal one month in advance. When making the reservation the individual that I spoke with reassured me that we would have a booth. Now back to reality. We arrive on Christmas Eve and the hostess attempted to seat us near the front at a makeshift table. After politely objecting to the move we were seated in a table in the actual dining room, at a table for two even though we had a reservation for three. The waiter promptly took our drink order and brought out bread. He was obviously overwhelmed sprinting around apologizing to us and other tables attempting to fulfill orders as the managers watched and did nothing. The lights flicker on and off constantly throughput the whole meal(bad electricity)? The apps were good, the meal also. Desert Shake was ok If you don’t mind having it in a “sippy cup.”  Oh...they do state a “two hour limit” for dining, which is comical since we couldn’t get a visit to our table within 15 minutes after the initial couple visits. In a nutshell...good waiter over worked. Management not contributing with clearing tables, checking on customers, serving food. Overpriced. Not organized. Disappointing.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
We made reservations a month in advance and it took us an hour to be seated. Once we got seated we got our drinks and it took them over 45 mins to get appetizer. Some of the appetizers came out cold. We kept having to ask to have our drinks filled and then they would never show back up to fill them. Two hours later we finally got our main course. Three of the plates didn’t come out with everyone’s food and had to wait additional 15 mins followed by a complaint.  We asked for some butter for the lobster and by the time the butter came out the lobster was already cold. With all of this, our drinks were only filled 3 times during the 4 hours we were their. We were trying to have a special night but it was ruined by poor service. The food was good beside the fact that some of it came out cold. Unfortunately we would not go back due to such poor service.</Review>

<Text>Views are pretty good, if you like freeways and the Valley, Looks nice at night.  But the food is sub par . . . very limited menu and everything is over salted to the point that you can't get enough to drink!  Hmmmm, maybe there's a strategy there.  I wouldn't go back for dinner, but I would go for drinks or coffee to watch the sun set. If it's a gourmet meal your after, you won't find it here, but the views really are pretty nice.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Food was good, but for the hair in the au gratin potatos.  Service is slow.  For the money charged, there shouldn't be tables with massive water stains on them, marring the tables.  Staff was friendly. Deducted my meal after the hair incident.  Was disgusting, though.</text>

<GmapID>0x80c29011ba9d643d:0xa5ea6e4db9be3f1e</GmapID><text>A very good restaurant with amazing views of the entire SFV. I've only been there for the sunday brunch, which I really like and have been to several times. But beware of going on a holiday or special occasion day like mother's day, they raise the prices for those special days.  There isn't anything extra done, well maybe a few flowers, and you don't get anything extra; you just get to pay more.  I used to go regularly until I happened to go on one of those special days and had no idea until they brought the check. At that time they didn't advertise or give notice to the price increase, they may have changed that since.  If prices are an issue, as it was for this memeber of a family of 5, make sure to ask ahead of time.</text>< time>

I was talking to A Gentleman I haven't seen Since High school, On Facebook One Day, Paul Hall, I love The Time We Spent Together, Paul Is A Gentleman. He did Recommend Going Here, and I'm glad we did, I ordered Salmon, and Paul Ordered Chicken Salad; 2 glasses of Lemon Water And Coffee. Everything Was Delicious. Afterwards, Paul and I Had A Bloody Mary, "Wonderful Bartender, Beautiful Blue Eyes, And Wonderful Conversationist. Beautiful View, I Thouroughly Enjoyed My Time. Thank You Paul For Such A Wonderful Time.💝<//Text>

<Review>I wanted to take my girlfriend somewhere very special and nice for her birthday. It was easy to to reserve a table for two that day right over the phone. A really nice lady booked my reservation and answered the questions I had. Parking was easy, we were seated rather quickly, and the staff was very nice. The restaurant has a pretty nice view of the valley. When we got there the restaurant had a many open tables but the bar was very busy. It wasn't so bad on a Thursday night.
Our waiter attended us quickly with our menus and asked for drinks. Minutes later he brought our appetizer. When it came to our entrees, we ordered, but did not receive anything until many minutes later. We had finished our appetizers, drank almost all our drinks, and had finish taking pictures of the occasion. We were starting to get very impatient and wondering if they were even working on our food. 45 minutes later we finally received our food, and I had in mind that they had done somthing to perfect the food because of the time it took, but it was sad say the food was average-at-best. The taste was nothing but ordinary, and to be honest the lobster was a little overcooked and chewy.
So the main dishes weren't all that fantastic, but later came the free birthday dessert which was the comeback of the night. I've got to say that the desserts at The Odyssey do not disappoint. Her birthday brownie with ice cream on top and powdered sugar was one of the best we've ever had! And I've got to say the creme brulee wasn't so bad either.
Overall the restaurant is pretty good but if you're looking for something jaw dropping, mouth-watering, and price worthy, I suggest you keep looking. As for drinks you're very limited to just alcoholic drinks and/or water. My girlfriend and I decided it was sadly a once-in-a-lifetime visit and we don't believe we will be going back anytime soon.< /Review>< Pics>

I am wishing I could rate Odyssey as 5-star. How sad that they took an excellent view and classic wood-paneled restaurant and added poorly cooked food that is geared for catering large events. Look, rubbery shrimp, raw filets, and boring boiled red potatoes do not have a place in this restaurant. Contemporize the menu and cook food correctly. How about adding some salt, which was sorely missing? Again, okay for a wedding reception; not acceptable for a classy, romantic restaurant.

One reviewer commented about the state of repairs. We walked past a chair with the back so loose that it is an injury in the making. Staff need to report broken chairs and management needs to fit them.  This was the only repair issue we saw.

Service... hoo hum, but at least replaced the over-cooked shrimp with some that were edible.

Other than that, a great view. 5-star view and setting with 2-star food. There is potential for great restaurant, if the owners realize that their restaurant guests are at least as important as the big catering events that are hosted in other rooms.< /review>

I choose the Odyssey Restaurant in Granada Hills, CA as the venue for my daughter's Sweet 15 Birthday or Quinceañera. I knew that the view was amazing, but Anias made our pre-event coordination easy and stress-less. She is kind and knows how to listen. She pays attention to your likes and dislikes, and makes sure she addresses any questions you may have. On the day of the event, the food was exquisite, the service was excellent, Jorge, the event lead, and the event manager made sure the schedule was followed to the minute and were available at all times if needed. All the servers were very professional. I received so many great complements on the food, the service and atmosphere. Couldn't have asked for a better venue. We loved everything about our experience!  To the Odyssey staff, thank you!  With sincerity,  Mayra.< /review>

Great scenic views, but the food was overpriced, bland, almost inedible. We had a reservation, but still had to wait 40 minutes to be seated. Next time, I'll climb a mountain with a picnic basket, a bottle of wine and I'll have a much better time.<//Text>

Sunday brunch was off the hook. So much to choose from that it expands into three rooms! More then you can imagine. Through in the hilltop view and you have it all.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>The Odyssey is a hilltop restaurant overlooking the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County, California. It has wonderful food, but more importantly, the ambiance makes it special. At night you can see the entire valley laid out before you like a pile of jewels. There is a firepit out on the patio where you can eat al fresco if you want. The service is prompt, the wait staff is friendly and helpful. I went there on a first date with my future husband, and it was the most romantic, wonderful time. We closed the place down, staying till almost 2am. We had bacon wrapped filet minon with steamed vegetables, and tiramisu for dessert. It's a dinner I will never forget, because of the romance, the atmosphere, and the beautiful view of the Valley below us on a clear cool night.< /Text>< Pictures>

Food wasn't all that great. I found hair in my butter. The salad was bitter and the croutons were stale. The chicken was dry and the mushroom sauce was watered down. The view is the only reason to come. Ants are a major problem here too!!!!</review>

This isn't really a place you come for food but you come for the view.

We went for date night and it was very romantic with the view outside.  The food was just OK.

The Buffalo Shrimp appetizer was very good.  I got prime rib, medium rare, and my boyfriend got the cowboy ribeye. My prime rib came medium well to well done and I think had it not been for that it would have been pretty good. But, for me, it was dry.  The augratin potatoes were delicious though and I love that they have their own farm on prem.

In another review I saw someone complain that you couldn't taste the food because it was all too salty.  I get that review but for me the salt was great.  I liked not having to add any additional and I didn't feel it was too overwhelming.

I think we would for sure go back again, as the food wasn't bad just wasn't amazing, for the view.  On a nice warm summer night it would be great to sit out on the patio.< /Text>

<Review>A little run down?
That's what I heard from someone else too.
We went for a company party.
Have not been there in 8 years.
We (my wife and I) were not impressed.
We went 2 hours early and sat in the bar.
Yeah, the views were great, but the appetizers were not.
We waited a long time to get the appetizers. They brought us the wrong order at first. They took that back. Wonder if they served it to someone else since it was already delivered to us? I can go into details but I don't think it will matter at this time. Good thing we got there early!
Once in the party, they served appetizers. The chicken was a little dry.
Once the buffet started, I was not to impressed with the food. The prime rib was ok, but seemed a little overcooked, as it melted in your mouth ( I do mean melted!). Now, I smoke meats at home, and I know when something is that soft that its over cooked! The Au Gratin Potatoes were not very good, and very hard to cut into the top. The salmon was ok. The chicken just ok too.
Everything just seem to be Ok, as the 3 stars show, 2.5 stars if I could give it a 1/2 star!
As a comparison, our other holiday parties at other locations were a whole lot better, and I didn't think one was that great, but heck, it was a whole lot better than this!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>A girlfriend from Norway flew in so I thought I'd treat her to this fave of mine for the beautiful evening view and some good chow.  The maitre dé/mgr. was the BEST!  What a neat guy.  He got us nice window seats for their killer view, and was the most on point person ever.  They are ahead of their time as they even had a special vegan dish which we ordered.  I have always ordered all manner of food there which was delicious and their vegan dish was no exception.  Liv wanted to know if the butter they served with the bread was margerine and what was in it etc.  I wanted to die as I knew it was butter and what's in that but cream?  The Mgr. Mr. Chris Gutierrez was the consumate pro and graciously offered to go and find out for her!   Mr. Gutierrez even offered to show me the new garden they got, where they now grow and get some of their FRESH ingredients from!   I love the Odyssey and always will!<//Text><Name>Noor Pekala< /Name>< Rating>

Food was decent, service subpar for the cost of eating here. Kept having to wave our server for help, food served almost an hour later. And, we had a reservation since it was our anniversary</review>

Just came from Keith Van Zandts 50th Birthday Bash & everything was spot on! The food was excellent, the bar tender & staff were attentive & you can't beat the view if you're in the SFV. Even the valet attendants were quick & polite.
I'd highly recommend the Odessy for a fantastic night out ^_^< /Text>

<Date>1467926456406</Date><Rating>2<//Rating><Review>The brunch does not even deserve one star.  It is overpriced and the food was beyond terrible.  Beef was like shoe leather, desserts were almost nonexistent and bread was like a week old. Most of all, why can you not order from the menu?  We did not know it was only brunch and after looking over the food should have left.  $40.00 was highway robbery. It was horrible and since it was for a birthday celebration made it just that much more unpleasant..

With that said I have been here for weddings and parties. The food was subpar and view was nice so I'll give them 2 stars for that.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Great location for any context: from large gathering of friends to couples romantic moment. The staff is amazingly welcoming and kind, and the environment beautiful and simple. The view over San Fernando Valley is surreal in many ways. Hoping for the buffet weekends to come back soon to make that place even more exciting.</review><time>1621727753395< /time><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrt5vNQw1XIBTKYN0AdSyVytBiKx0D_atBHgQM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkaSEfgDXp7asUf_OyUBaZAMjkyvO4reIP42QH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< user_name>

He offered and served everything on time. Really a very fine and attentive person.
