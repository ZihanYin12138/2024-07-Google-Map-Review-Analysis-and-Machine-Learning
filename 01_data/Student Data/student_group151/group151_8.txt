<text>From the first phone call your employees were courteous and knew their stuff. I was taken care of quickly and the signs were ready on time. Kevin went the extra mile and mounted the signs for me while I waited! This is my first time using FastSigns and I remember thinking - I will definitely be back! Wonderful, wonderful service.

I ordered a sign for my church and I was truly happy with the outcome. There was a type O on one of the words and I was able to take it back with no problem. I will take my future work to them and recommend them to anyone who needs their services. They are professional and serious about the work they do. Thank you Cindy.< /review>

Super easy to get a quote, and they made my sign just as I designed it, from an image I sent to them. Friendly and capable staff from design to installation.< /review>

Their prices are extremely reasonable. They also helped our business with our main sign out front and for any service they don't offer they've had a referral for someone who could help get the job done. I will be a continuing customer for a while. Thank you for all of your help!<//Review></record>

Because this was a long-distance transaction, I (the designer) did not see the end product myself. However, the interactions were professional and prompt throughout my long and involved project-adjustment process, the final product turned out extremely well (according to my coworker), and the team did a great job overall accommodating a very specific custom job. Thank you for making what could have been a long-distance hassle into a slam dunk!</Text>

<Text>They are close, friendly and we've been working with them for years.
Our church has been having banners made (we do a fair number of them) with FastSigns for as long as I have been here. They are accommodating and patient as sometimes decisions are made at glacial speed.
I sometimes wish the design help might have a bit more flair, a bit more daring.<//Text>< pics>

I've been working regularly with my local Fastsigns on Santa Rosa Ave. for almost a year now and its been nothing short of a pleasure. Communication about scheduling and pricing is always prompt and they always produce great work. Although my projects aren't the biggest of runs, they treat me like a valued customer and get my projects done on time.<//Review>

<Review>I know it's going to sound corny, but Fastsigns is fast. I got several bids from different companies. I got my estimate from Shawn at Fastsigns in a couple of days, the other guys took a week or two and were about a few hundred dollars more. Once I placed my order, Shawn worked with me to fit my schedule, showed up on time, and the Installer did a great job.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Samples of what was needed, for tenant signage, were taken into the FastSigns shop. Kevin looked them over, took measurements, and said he would have the replacements ready within several days. The signage strips and transparent covers were picked up and placed in the display. Once again it looks professional!</Review>

this is my story. I needed a sign for my new store opening SOON in rohnert park. . Irene's Fitting Room all the other business s had been using this other place for thei signs for several years. I went to that place and the person in there acted as tho making my sign was just not even important at all.  I couldn't even understand the person and I was told that I should go home look up my graphics and my color online and when I figured it out email it to him and he get back to me . So I went home tried to figure it out and said this is absurd..  by Monday morning I had looked  up a couple other places and wrote the number down the first one I called was Fast Signs on Santa Rosa Ave. in Santa Rosa.  The gentleman who answered the phone was kind and polite he got right to the point I explained to him what I was looking for the size of my sign etc. .  He was very thorough and asked me specifics and gave me options I had an estimate from him within a matter of a half an hour or less it was fantastic .  So I went down to Fast Signs on the Avenue and gave my deposit and he said it wouldn't be long I waited a few days and lo and behold he called to say my son was ready when I picked it up I was floored it was absolutely gorgeous it was the best sign I've ever had made and I've had a few shops in my life I would recommend this business highly to anybody who needs good service   . courteous and professional sales help and best of all a wonderful sign that truly is soooo important when you have a business. So who's ever reading this don't hesitate call Fast Signs because they are the best in my opinion. They are next to Boot Barn.<//text>

< Review>
The team at Fastsign.. what can I say, but ROCKSTARS!!! we had hired a local car wrapper to wrap our car and place all the logos and numbers for a rally, the night before the rally they literally left it a mess!! no logos, holes in the wrap... I sent a frantic email to several places that print vinyl for cars in the middle of the night. At 9am the day of the rally, I received a call while driving from Cherise at Fastsign, following up on the estimate she had already sent! I pulled over and almost cried, ran to Fastsign to pay. We needed the very large logos and numbers by 2 to get on the road by 3. They called me at 11:50 and they were ready! they also provided a large piece of white vinyl to cover holes left by the wrapper. I WILL NEVER GO ANYWHERE ELSE. Thanks to Cherise (I hope that's correct) and her calm, friendly and accommodating demeanor, I got the guys on the road on time and looking great! THANK YOU FASTSIGN!</Review>

I believe this location is a matter of necessity/convenience for many folks, like myself. Unfortunately, I need to rent from this location occasionally.  My experiences have never been great, or too bad, until recently.

I had rented a vehicle prior to this visit, and provided a review (to Hertz) of my experience. The vehicle I was given, was not clean, despite having waited 30 minutes for a wash.

I bring this up, because I received call from the branch manager, shortly after submitting my review. Hertz offers an option if you do not want to be contacted regarding you review; I made that selection. Despite this, the branch manager called me and let me know she was not pleased with my review. Really?!?!

I recently had to go back to rent another vehicle. When I arrived, there was a customer who was clearly frustrated.  He needed a sepcific vehicle and when the branch manager arrived, she barely acknowledged him.

I asked if I could rent 2 different vehicles on the lot, per the usual, I was told no. Last time it was because the vehicle I wanted needed an oil change that would take "8 hours". This time, it was because both vehicles were "reserved". I have rented from this location over a half a dozen times, and have never been given the vehicle I ask for. Based on my observations of other renters, this seems to be an issue for other patrons who visit this branch.

Getting back to this rental experience, I was given a very small SUV, that was absolutely disgusting on the inside. Considering the experience I just had with the branch manager, I had expected some effort would be put into making sure I was given a clean vehicle. Nope! Despite Covid, I was given a filthy vehicle, with unknown dried liquids splattered throughout. Also had very visible shoe marks all over the seats (please see photos).

If you do not need to rent from this location, I strongly suggest going to another branch, or other car rental company.</Review>

< Review>
Got a good deal on Priceline, but got the car and realized it was super dirty once I got home to pack. Smudge prints on windows, touch screen, seats... French fries Under seats and a whole bunch in the stow away compartments! DISGUSTING!!!  My rental said the vehicle would be  sanitized..i highly doubt that was the case...i had to wipe things down myself!
Wouldn't go back here.. Or recommend.< /Review>

<Date>1613257818717</Date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>My 99 year old father rented a car from this rip off of a place. He took 2 terrible falls and ended up in the hospital. He drove the car 31 miles. Was charged $717 and a late fee of $60. Amber, the manager would not take into consideration any of these devastating medical circumstances my father was up against. She said she should $1000 for the car for 31 miles of driving. Amber said she called my father and told him his car was late hence the $60 late fee. My father is deaf. When I'm there he has me answer all his calls. I even called Hertz customer service service center somewhere in India. No help there either. Shame on Hertz for ripping off a WWII 99 year old gentlemen who was hospitalized and could not return his car in a timely manner. Whatever happened to compassion, empathy and human kindness. I'm so disgusted!< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Pick up my rental and the vehicle was dirty inside. I ask the the representative if they had cleaner vehicles and he said “ No that’s how they arrive from the airport” I’m not happy customer! They advertise cleaner vehicles due to the COVID epidemic but clearly not the truth!!! This is not acceptable!!!<//Text>< UserId.>

Horrible selection of cars Amber Rose ( Amber Areoli) is extremely rude and  incompetent. She is bossy does not listen to the customer doesn't even talk to her co-workers with respect. I am shocked how she still has a job.</Review>

<review>Fastest service ever! I was in and out in less than 10 mins. Hertz have great cars, that are clean and nice at an affordable price. No hassel and Hertz don't jerk you around. They also accept debit cards where as other places like Enterprise Rental Car doesn't. I would recommend Hertz to anyone.<//review>< gmap_id>

<review>Shocked at huge cost that was not explained after the car was turned in. They have a difficult contract to read. Now I see why. And they discouraged me from reading by just pointing to the signature line. The bill on first on the checking account was about $140. Then it turned into $450. There was no preparation for the high cost, no phone call, no explanation. When I called another Hertz they suggested for the number of days it would be much less. I feel ripped off. I'm going back to their competition. Be careful.<//review><Response>None< /Response>< date>

<Review>Placentia Hertz was a horrible experience. Terrible customer service. My car is being repaired after a fender bender.  I'm
AAA insured, and Hertz was one of their suggestions for my covered car rental.
A Full size car was reserved several days prior, and confirmed in  the AM on the day of pick up.  Instead, a MINI, dirty, spotted, and soaking wet car is what I got. When I asked when they might have a full size as I'd reserved, I was flippantly told they didn't have a crystal ball, but definitely not that day or the next day! I was told I could go to any other Hertz rental and exchange it if was wasn't happy. I was to research where and who had a full size car as they were too busy. (They were busy, and only only flip, rude person was working the counter).
I called the Auto Club and complained. They apologized as they don't want to ever recommend a sub par place. AAA called their reps and a couple hours later Placentia Hertz called me and said my full size car would be ready for pick up in 5 minutes, (they'd magically gotten one in)!
I do now have a Camary, very scratched up front, back, and sides and it had LESS  than 1/4 tank of gas!  I pointed out and took pictures of all the deep scratches, front, back, and  sides. I'm so mistrustful of them! Im fearful they will try something when I turn it in. Stay away from Hertz in Placentia!</Review>< UserId.>

The car was dependable to drive, but it was the dirtiest rental l have ever driven.  There was a grimy, sticky residue on every surface I touched while sitting in the driver's seat.  The car was not vacuumed prior to my use.  When I went to  place  items in the driver door side pocket, there were crushed potato  chips lining the bottom of the pocket.   I spent 45 minutes cleaning the front section of the car before I would drive it.  If I had more time prior to my trip I would have returned this car and gone to another rental agency.  It's hard to believe this franchise stays in business.<//text>

Jerks! Reserved a van one month in advance when we got there it wasn't there and was being delivered from LAX.  Wouldn't provide SUV that was on site because it's an upgrade. No business savvy at all. Went to enterprise around the corner and they had a van on site no hassle ready to go. Hertz can take a hike!!!</Text>

I have worked with Hertz in Placentia for 10 years now, I just want everyone to know that if you do not get ahold of their manager Danny, it is the most horrific experience! I called today and spoke to Kara, and asked if she could please call their hertz in Sylmar & arrange  a rental for my customer who lives there to come here  & have one of Danny's staff pick it up for Saturday
Now here is the difference. If Danny was there he would had said Sure I can do this for you. however this was not the case, Kara tells me that she will transfer me to someone else I think the district manager, I was on hold for 10 minuets. What is worse I had my customer call there first and ask for Danny so that he could do this himself, my customer called me back and told me what a horrible experience he had. Kara had given him an 800 number and then he called that & he was transferred 3 times, & the people on the 800 number could not speak very good English. All I could do was apologize and let him know that I had failed as well. I am glad he did not cancel his Enterprise rental like I told him to.
I don't know what is going on up at that office, but I know one thing, I am calling Enterprise for our customers needs for now on.
Kara if you don't like your job leave, I know you have been there for awhile, Poor customer service Shame on you!!
I would never treat a vendor like that... I now know how you treat customers by doing it to one of mine and I don't appreciate it!!</Text>

I Called the day before my reservation to verify details, I ended up speaking to a person who barely spoke English and could give me only super vague information that I was requesting regarding my reservation. I tried cancelling my reservation online, but Hertz website said I had to call to cancel my reservation. I called and they said they cancelled, but I never received any cancellation confirmation. I ended up reserving at Enterprise instead, I got all my questions answered, a better rate, and way better customer service. You are far better off going to Enterprise for rentals in the Placentia, YL, or Anaheim hills areas.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcd405ae7f8063:0xfb5909958973f843< /Gmap_id></record>

This barbershop is by far one of the best retreats around, professional in every aspect but friendly too. The hairstylist and her dedicated team will do their best to meet your needs and give you your ultimate treatment. Massages are a must and worth every penny. Highly worth a visit!< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>The barbers are all great and talented and it is a safe place to get your haircut. It's by appointment only, which you can usually book the same day. That way there's few people in the shop. The A/C is turned on to recirculate the air as opposed to other places I've been across the street have only fans on. Price was cheap too.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcd98664254771:0x68080a517d3f2278<//gmapID></record>

The shop itself is probably the most interesting room I have ever been in. Good conversation, great people, even better haircuts. You can't go wrong here, just a great barber.</review><gmap_id>0x80dcd98664254771:0x68080a517d3f2278< /gmap_id>< username>

Chad is a great barber that works hard and takes care of his customers. His prices are fair so you won't have to empty your wallet to look good. He also offers great hair products and will help you pick one out based on what you're looking for.</text>

I went here today because the barber I usually go to was busy. I really like this place. The whole room was having a conversation. The environment was really nostalgic with old KROQ stickers and vintage memorabilia.
I will definitely be back. My cut was super fast and just like I like it.
Great job.<//text>

<Text>Great first experience at this Barbershop/hair store.  I was helped by Stephanie who was very friendly and made me feel like I had been there dozens of times before.  The decor of the shop is like a trip back in time.  I went in for a haircut and I left with a desire to tell more people about it so they experience the same thing.  Thank you.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I can’t begin to express how much I love this Salon!!! I recently moved to the area and I was looking around for a good Salon. I am very particular about my hair so I did do some research. I walked into Chapter 1 and the salon was gorgeous, clean and very modern with a touch of uniqueness. All the girls were super friendly and welcoming. I had an appointment with the owner Christine and let me tell you she is so knowledgeable when it comes to hair. She told me that her and her stylists continue their education by taking classes to keep up with the latest trends. My hair turned out awesome. I’m thinking about coming back once a week just to get my hair washed because Christine does the best head and neck massage. Also who doesn’t like mimosas when getting their hair done. I was also able to get a facial by Stevie and now my face feels like a smooth like butter, I used to work at a spa so I know good facials and this was top one by far. I love how they host events at the salon as well they have yoga and mimosas once a month and Salsa dancing classes and Sangria. I have yet to attend Salsa and Sangria, but the Yoga and mimosas was so much fun.</Review>

I wish I could rate this 10 out of 5 stars, because I’m in love with the results! 😍 I was blessed enough to have Stacie cut my hair, which was originally down to my butt. I’ve never had short hair, but I wanted to take that leap and get it cut to my collarbone. She worked with me so well, and brought my vision to life. It’s almost as if she was in my brain and could see exactly what I was envisioning. She even fixed my bangs for me, so now they’re full but still wispy. I can’t stop looking at myself in the mirror now! I haven’t had any good experiences with salons before, but I finally found my stylist.
Not to mention the place was extremely clean, and it was a very pleasant environment. Stacie was extremely friendly, and made me feel so welcomed! I felt like a friend was cutting my hair, which is definitely different from other experiences I’ve had. I can’t sing this place enough praise. If you haven’t had the amazing experience of getting your hair done here, you’re really missing out.< /Review>

<review>Called and booked a same day appointment for a big haircut. I didn't have much of an idea about what I wanted, but Mary Elizabeth was fantastic and helped me to figure out exactly what I was going for - both my cut and style turned out great. Being able to work with someone who understands curly hair was such a bonus and I'm so glad that I booked here! Clean facility, cute decor, laid back environment, and fun people!!< /review>< Response>

<Review>BEST SALON I'VE EVER BEEN TOO !!

I haven't gotten a hair cut in over 3 years, so I was kinda nervous to do anything but also very ready for change.

I had the pleasure of getting my hair done by Marie that day. She asked questions throughout the session making it a bit easier for me to relax and put my trust into her. When she turned me around for the final result I wanted to scream of joy because my hair turned out EXACTLY how I wanted it!  I'm very happy with my hair and would love to come back and experience it all over again.

I want to thank the ladies for making me feel so welcomed and at home when I first walked in. It really helped calm my nerves.

The salon is well decorated and very clean. Not to mention Their killer playlist. I felt like I fit right in with everyone! My over all experience was great!

I'll be returning to Chapter One Salon again!! I definitely recommend this place over any boring salon any day!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dc6e195bd68bc5:0x1e1e58220dd47f11< /gmap_id></record>

<username>Andrea Barela</username><Time>1546653439018< /Time><Text>Chapter One is the best salon I’ve ever been to. All of the girls there are so professional and knowledgeable. The owner, Christine Pierce, makes you feel so welcome and takes time with each client to make sure they feel heard and important. They got my hair ‘wedding ready,’ throughout my engagement, including putting in my Hair Talk extensions (which I loved). I also used their esthetician/makeup artist, for my special day as well. They did such a great job with my bridal party and with my hair on my wedding day! I would recommend them to anyone!<//Text>< rating>

<Review>I love Chapter One Hair and Body Lab! But most of all, I love Christine!! She has been cutting my hair for about the last 5 years and I basically just trust her to do whatever because she has taken the time to get to know me, knows what I want, and has the talent. For the past year or so we have been committed to doing "dustings", as she calls them, which basically means that I come in every 6 weeks or so and she takes about 15 minutes to snip off all the sad dead ends. It costs me about $25 per cut and LET ME TELL YOU, I have long beautiful hair!! For someone with fine fragile hair like me, it's a miracle! I HIGHLY recommend going in and seeing Christine or any of the other very lovely stylists at Chapter One to make any of your beauty dreams come true!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dc6e195bd68bc5:0x1e1e58220dd47f11< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

<text>I’ve been coming to Chapter 1 for 5 months now. Every single time I am in here is pure magic. Alexis has hooked me up each and every single time. She tells me if something is doable or not & I ALWAYS leave EXTREMELY satisfied. The staff is AMAZING! Super friendly; making you feel like you’ve known each other for years.

Everyone that knows the owner, Christine, knows that this was a long time coming and everyone is treated like family.

Whether you need a quick trim to cut and color I don’t think anyone could find a better place.

There couldn’t be a more happier and friendly group of people than the women of Chapter One Hair and body lab.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>Do yourself a favor. Come here. See Christine. Be amazed.
Seriously, I've had dye jobs, extensions, massages and even a birthday party at this place and it's never anything short of amazing. ALL of the ladies are incredibly talented and friendly, and the shop mascot Rose is pretty much the sweetest pooch you'll ever meet. Fantastic ambiance, great service and you leave feeling like you have a new lease on life! They support other local businesses and the art/decor is rad. Go here. #you'rewelcome< /review>< pics>

I've been to Alexis twice now and both times I've been completely blown away.  I'm usually really particular about how I want my hair but I know I'm in good hands with this woman...She knows what I want with my hair even before I do! This second time we did a more intense purple and she had the idea to add little pops of blue. I'm so in love with this look! Each time I have left feeling so fabulous!! I have gotten so many compliments on my hair looking so healthy and vibrant. The AlterEgo products they use are vegan and I loved the smell so I took home their shampoo & conditioner. My hair has never felt better! I've been referring everyone and their momma to this place. I love it that much. She's a great stylist and teacher. I have already learned what I need to do to prevent more heat damage & what the products they're using are doing to my hair. I can't wait to go to some of the events they're doing at the salon this spring. They're my favorite escape!🤗< /Text>

This woman who runs this place, I actually met while on lunch in Oceanside. She was in front of me in line, and on the phone with I would hope was a dear friend. She was public ally having twins mos disrespectful vile vulgar conversation about some of her urgent clients I have ever heard. I’ve nevwr once heard such disrespect towards others, personal or professionally acquainted in my life. I managed to catch the name of the salon while she checked out and talked up her new shop to the cashier. If people only knew what was being said while they weren’t looking.

I’d seriously reconsider any and every notion to give your money to this establishment.< /Text>

<review>I can’t begin to express how much I love this Salon!!! I recently moved to the area and I was looking around for a good Salon. I am very particular about my hair so I did do some research. I walked into Chapter 1 and the salon was gorgeous, clean and very modern with a touch of uniqueness. All the girls were super friendly and welcoming. I had an appointment with the owner Christine and let me tell you she is so knowledgeable when it comes to hair. She told me that her and her stylists continue their education by taking classes to keep up with the latest trends. My hair turned out awesome. I’m thinking about coming back once a week just to get my hair washed because Christine does the best head and neck massage. Also who doesn’t like mimosas when getting their hair done. I was also able to get a facial by Stevie and now my face feels like a smooth like butter, I used to work at a spa so I know good facials and this was top one by far. I love how they host events at the salon as well they have yoga and mimosas once a month and Salsa dancing classes and Sangria. I have yet to attend Salsa and Sangria, but the Yoga and mimosas was so much fun.</review>< pictures>

<text>I wish I could rate this 10 out of 5 stars, because I’m in love with the results! 😍 I was blessed enough to have Stacie cut my hair, which was originally down to my butt. I’ve never had short hair, but I wanted to take that leap and get it cut to my collarbone. She worked with me so well, and brought my vision to life. It’s almost as if she was in my brain and could see exactly what I was envisioning. She even fixed my bangs for me, so now they’re full but still wispy. I can’t stop looking at myself in the mirror now! I haven’t had any good experiences with salons before, but I finally found my stylist.
Not to mention the place was extremely clean, and it was a very pleasant environment. Stacie was extremely friendly, and made me feel so welcomed! I felt like a friend was cutting my hair, which is definitely different from other experiences I’ve had. I can’t sing this place enough praise. If you haven’t had the amazing experience of getting your hair done here, you’re really missing out.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Called and booked a same day appointment for a big haircut. I didn't have much of an idea about what I wanted, but Mary Elizabeth was fantastic and helped me to figure out exactly what I was going for - both my cut and style turned out great. Being able to work with someone who understands curly hair was such a bonus and I'm so glad that I booked here! Clean facility, cute decor, laid back environment, and fun people!!< /Review>

BEST SALON I'VE EVER BEEN TOO !!

I haven't gotten a hair cut in over 3 years, so I was kinda nervous to do anything but also very ready for change.

I had the pleasure of getting my hair done by Marie that day. She asked questions throughout the session making it a bit easier for me to relax and put my trust into her. When she turned me around for the final result I wanted to scream of joy because my hair turned out EXACTLY how I wanted it!  I'm very happy with my hair and would love to come back and experience it all over again.

I want to thank the ladies for making me feel so welcomed and at home when I first walked in. It really helped calm my nerves.

The salon is well decorated and very clean. Not to mention Their killer playlist. I felt like I fit right in with everyone! My over all experience was great!

I'll be returning to Chapter One Salon again!! I definitely recommend this place over any boring salon any day!<//text>

<text>I love Chapter One Hair and Body Lab! But most of all, I love Christine!! She has been cutting my hair for about the last 5 years and I basically just trust her to do whatever because she has taken the time to get to know me, knows what I want, and has the talent. For the past year or so we have been committed to doing "dustings", as she calls them, which basically means that I come in every 6 weeks or so and she takes about 15 minutes to snip off all the sad dead ends. It costs me about $25 per cut and LET ME TELL YOU, I have long beautiful hair!! For someone with fine fragile hair like me, it's a miracle! I HIGHLY recommend going in and seeing Christine or any of the other very lovely stylists at Chapter One to make any of your beauty dreams come true!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc6e195bd68bc5:0x1e1e58220dd47f11</gmap_id></record>

She tells me if something is doable or not & I ALWAYS leave EXTREMELY satisfied. The staff is AMAZING! Super friendly; making you feel like you’ve known each other for years. I HIGHLY recommend this place for all your hair needs.</Review>

<Text>This place is amazing. Their service is top notch. The hair stylists are actively continuing education to bring the latest and greatest to their clients.

Everyone that knows the owner, Christine, knows that this was a long time coming and everyone is treated like family.

Whether you need a quick trim to cut and color I don’t think anyone could find a better place.

There couldn’t be a more happier and friendly group of people than the women of Chapter One Hair and body lab.< /Text>< Rate>

Do yourself a favor. Come here. See Christine. Be amazed.
Seriously, I've had dye jobs, extensions, massages and even a birthday party at this place and it's never anything short of amazing. ALL of the ladies are incredibly talented and friendly, and the shop mascot Rose is pretty much the sweetest pooch you'll ever meet. Fantastic ambiance, great service and you leave feeling like you have a new lease on life! They support other local businesses and the art/decor is rad. Go here. #you'rewelcome< /review>

I am not a cool hair person. I don't speak cool hair lingo. I'm terrible at small talk. And for more than five years, Christine has made my hair and my life better. Every time I leave her chair, I feel confident and love my new hair. She's helped me find my style. I've moved two hours away, and I still drive down every few months to see Christine and the other wonderful stylists at Chapter One. I always feel welcome and like part of the family. I've converted one of my new neighbors too; she also now makes the drive down to see Christine, even without me!< /review>

I've been to Alexis twice now and both times I've been completely blown away.  I'm usually really particular about how I want my hair but I know I'm in good hands with this woman...She knows what I want with my hair even before I do! This second time we did a more intense purple and she had the idea to add little pops of blue. I'm so in love with this look! Each time I have left feeling so fabulous!! I have gotten so many compliments on my hair looking so healthy and vibrant. The AlterEgo products they use are vegan and I loved the smell so I took home their shampoo & conditioner. My hair has never felt better! I've been referring everyone and their momma to this place. I love it that much. She's a great stylist and teacher. I have already learned what I need to do to prevent more heat damage & what the products they're using are doing to my hair. I can't wait to go to some of the events they're doing at the salon this spring. They're my favorite escape!🤗</text>

This woman who runs this place, I actually met while on lunch in Oceanside. She was in front of me in line, and on the phone with I would hope was a dear friend. She was public ally having twins mos disrespectful vile vulgar conversation about some of her urgent clients I have ever heard. I’ve nevwr once heard such disrespect towards others, personal or professionally acquainted in my life. I managed to catch the name of the salon while she checked out and talked up her new shop to the cashier. If people only knew what was being said while they weren’t looking.

I’d seriously reconsider any and every notion to give your money to this establishment.< /text>

<text>The services that I receive from Carmichael medical is excellent. The check-in time was fast and I didn't have to wait. The front desk employee's are always helpful and professional.
I saw NP Lana who explained everything to me in a very clear manner and answered all my questions. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It’s rare to find a person that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as Lana does. She has outstanding quality of care. I highly recommend becoming her patient! It was a great experience from start to finish with the providers and the staff.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Dr Tekloa is a great doctor. He always listes to you and addresses your problems first. I've had many doctors over the years and he is my favorite ever . if you are frustrated with doctors please try Dr Tekola he will do you right, and with a smile. Ive just moved to FLORIDA and gosh, I really wish I could have taken him with me.
So I'd like to say THANK YOU DR TEKOLA. I'LL MISS YOUR SERVICE.

He kept saying nothing was wrong with me and would not send me for any testing, Thank my luck I switched my insurance and doctor was diagnosed with stage chronic disease, which I am being treated for now. Someone needs to file a lawsuit against this bad doctor.</review>

<Text>If I could I would give this Doctor no stars I would for many different reasons and this also includes their office staff as well, considering how unprofessional they are (I believe her name is Inna she sits at the front desk, her name matches her very well with the rough, rude and unprofessional words coming out from her mouth to patients). I was in Dr. Svitlanas Plaschke's care for about a year before I started having health issues that needed attention due to an accident. It was throughout the course of 6 months that I realized this doctor misdiagnoses, has too many patients, doesn't listen to my health care concerns, wants to get you in and out ASAP, office staff looses paperwork/screenings in which you'll have to go in twice to redo because it disappears, doesn't call when testing comes in  or when referral is ready because  Dr. Svitlanas Plaschke's and office procedures believes if she has talked to you within the month you can wait until your next appointment to get your MRI results or any results for that matter(keep in mind apps are 1 month out so to get results I'm waiting 1 month NOT 2-3 DAYS as it should be)my injuries from her description and demeanor are small and insignificant( a doctor who says that should loose their license especially when MRI and X-ray claims different and when I called her out on it she immediately wanted to start doing her job and refer me to pain management and physical therapy. I recall her telling me I shouldn't be feeling any pain when I brought these concerns up to her and demanded a MRI, at my request she proceeded. Am I the Doctor or is she? Because my results showed the significance of my injuries that I feel every single day. If I were you id save my time and the headaches of dealing with the Doctors of this office and the rude unprofessional staff. Dr. Svitlanas Plaschke's has no stars on Healthgrades and now I understand why.
This has taught me that I am my own advocate and to watch for signs of a Doctor that has no understanding of what their job truly requires of them other than Dr. Svitlanas Plaschke's gaining just another pay check and me being just another name or number in the line of people she cant take on. There is so much more in regards to the unprofessionalism but I am tired of having to repeat myself.  I am ecstatic to say I have changed my care to a new Doctor that is professional, caring, diagnosis with precision and is compassionate!!!!!! Something this office does not have!!!! Finally I have a family physician with 5 stars from over thousands of patients.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Avoid this doctor they cant even send a referral the correct way and he doesn't have an issue with wasting your time and giving you the run around this doctor is totally inept and lazy and will not listen to you at all he was also trying to give me blood pressure medicine that I don't even need to take he needs to have his medical license taken away. This doctor is a big time idiot and doesn't know anything it's not a great idea to pick him as your doctor.< /Text>< name>

My parents are new patients at this office. They love everything about this office.  Scheduled first visit in a reasonable time.  No wait time in the lobby unlike many other offices . When we got there, receptionist was very welcoming, then dr Tekola spent enough time with us explaining everything we need to do in order to get healthier . My father felt bad and they all made sure that he is safely got into the car . They brought a wheelchair and transported him. Then they asked so many times if he is any better . Scheduled follow up appointment. We r very happy . Thank you<//text>

<text>Dr. Tekola was a good Doctor, he seamed to be careful and kept up with appointment's. But there was a desk female at the front counter who was very Rude and insulting. She called me a lier when i told her i called and left a message but no one called me back. By saying no you didn't, i said again, Yes i did and again she said no you didn't! I said don't call me a lier, and she replied are you calling us a lier. I think she was russian.

I asked him to have my vitamin levels checked on blood test and he did not want to although my insurance covers that. This is a standard  test and usually every doctor approves it. If the doctor is nice to you and tells you everything is fine that doesn't make him a good doctor.< /Review><UserId.>108970837095826085700</UserId.><pictures>None< /pictures><GmapID>0x809ade960d50372b:0xfd2c32bfecb6e72< /GmapID>< resp>

He's been my doctor for years. He's very patient and understanding. Very detail oriented and the main thing is his appointments are accurate. Never have to wait for hours and hours like other clinics.  When I have an appointment I am checked in right there and then.<//Review>

Dr. Tekola is a good doctor. He is attentive, caring, and respectful. My grandma has been going to his office for a very long time. And always answers her questions and concerns with respect. He always makes sure to give the very best care so that when she leaves, she will understand what she needs to do to better her health. My grandma Anna, is very grateful to come here.<//Review>

< Review>
This was my first visit to this office. I was seen by Stella the nurse practitioner. The front desk staff was very nice and super helpfull. They got me right in at my appointment time I didn't have to wait at all. I wasn't feeling well so they let me lay down in a room and sent Stella in to see me right away. Everyone there was super nice and very helpful I was super impressed with the nurse practitioner as well as the front desk receptionist I'm very happy with this place. I am super happy that HealthNet chose this place to be my new primary Care office when my other doctors office closed down.<//Review>

Dr. Tekola is very caring, kind, knowledgeable and devoted physician, we are blessed to have him as my parents' doctor - they've been his patients for over 13 years. We are grateful for his love, patience and dedication to elder patients, many of whom don't speak English.<//Review>

very bad , very bad ,
Dr dose not care or lesson to you.
The Dr was supposed to send the referral ! here is what happens ofter 2-3 weeks waiting as he told me, so ofter the wait I did not heard anything from them so I had to call them and ask that what happened with the referral the operator I was speaking with was very rude and told me that the referral is been denied by your insurance and I asked why ? She said in a rude way that they don’t know and told me to call my insurance and I did so, called my insurance and explained the situations and my insurance said that the Dr did not sent enough information about your problem like what it is? How big it is etc? So I called the Dr Abraham office again and explained what my insurance told me and they told me to wait for our phone call we will call you so it’s been another two weeks on top of the other 3 weeks and still heard nothing so today on the first of July 2019 I called there office to ask the status of referral but ofter calling 118 times I did not get any answer. I’m suffering pain so I went there to speak in person and at the same time I made another phone call to there office to see why they don’t answer as I was watching and being ignored from 10am to 3pm
The Dr and staff is ignoring and not doing there job, letting people suffer.<//review>

<Review>I have been a patient of Dr. Tekola for a number of years.  Dr. Tekola is friendly, understanding, smart, and conscientious.  He likes me to come in every few months so that he can monitor my blood pressure and to check to see if there are any new changes to my health.  Every so often he orders lab tests to make sure my body is working correctly and he is always happy to answer any questions that I may have.  If you are looking for a physician who is not only competent but someone who also takes a sincere interest in his patients, I highly recommend Dr. Tekola.<//Review><Response>None</Response><date>1558474019475</date></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Tekola has been my primary care physician for last 10 years. He is a very quiet personality. He  listens to your problem and takes his time to explain it to you in layman language. He is never in rush, always give you more than enough time at your every  visit. His front desk assistances always very cooperative,  takes cares of your appointments and calls incredibly. I am very happy with the service that I’m getting from Dr. Tekola and his office.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I have seen Dr. Tekola for over two years and believe he is caring and compassionate. He is intelligent, to the point and always advocate healthy life style. It hard to get a good doctor like him in the area with a Medical and Medicare insurance. He is very strict when it comes to prescribing narcotic pain medications.  If you are looking for narcotics, that is not a place to go. He prefers to address the underlying problem.
The cons; Hard to get appointment.  If you need to be seen right away, ER or urgent cares are your best option.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Worst Doctor, ever been suffering for 3 months countless ER Visits, due to his negligence my health has suffered, do not believe the positive reviews, do your self a favor and find another doctor, I have no idea How he's even in practice. Don't believe the fake reviews tekola's workers and friends try to post 5 star reviews on all websites so they can keep their jobs and money keeps coming in while giving people the crappiest care which is most likely causing deaths. At least fear god you fools.</review>

I feel  very fortunate to have Dr Tekola and his staff treating my healthcare needs. I have been a patient of his for at least five years and have never been disappointed. Dr Tekola is always sensitive to my individual needs and talks to me instead of at me. Also, his staff is always very polite and professional. I am permanently disabled and have several chronic pain issues. He recently prescribed me a non narcotic arthritis medication which has reduced my overall pain level by 20 to 30 percent. this allows me to walk more which also helps reduce pain.
If I remember correctly he also has a teaching degree which is impressive. The staff is bilingual too. It is hard to find a great doctor but I did.< /Text>

<Review>I have been a patient of Dr. Tekola's since 2011. I am 31 years old and I have Major illnesses as well as psychiatric diagnosis and dr. Tekola has been excellent with my healthcare he's very strict when it comes to narcotics and psychiatric medication however he will give you these medications if necessary until a specialist can address the issue I know this from personal experience I have also been in several car accidents and other major accidents that require me to wait for a specialist and dr. Tekola is very compassionate and make sure that I get everything I need I don't understand why people are saying it's hard to get an appointment because I can get an appointment sometime this week if I needed to the problem is everyone is going looking for pain medication and things of that sort and Dr tekola is the type of doctor who wants to address the underlying issue he's not going to just hand out narcotics like candy because he's concerned about your actual Health Care make no mistake about it dr. Tekola is awesome his staff is on point his office is clean I have seen his nurse practitioner one time I preferred to stay with dr. Tekola because he knew my health and details better than the practitioner if you're going for the narcotics forget it he's going to make sure whatever he prescribes you is absolutely necessary I would refer Dr tekola to anyone because he is that great I am leaving out of state next month in August and he is willing to make sure that I have all of my necessary medications narcotics and psychiatric included until I can transfer to another doctor out of state any other doctor would tell me to find a doctor in the state that I am going to so as far as Dr tekola being very and uncompassionate that's a lie and people need to stop at the end of the day as long as Dr tekola is in practice he will be my doctor because he's excellent.

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>My husband, and my 2 grown boys have seen this doctor each a couple of times. Dr. Tekola is lazy and very unprofessional and unsanitary. He's clothes alone say it all, with food stains on his clothes, the same clothes he wears all week. My husband went in there with a back and neck injury and all he did was give him some Norco's and sent him on his way, twice! No referral for physical therapy, nothing. He switched out of the and filed a complaint.

My son felt violated by Dr. Tekola when he was given a physical and Dr. Tekola did not wear gloves, touched his privates and only used hand sanitizer after, instead of washing his hands! Filthy dirty..what DR. would do that?<//review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Be careful, you will spend on them not only your health, which will deteriorate with the loss of the expected days, but also time. Very upset.

<Review>Always great service at Pete's. Had the crispy ham and cheese for the first time and its Soo good! Also did the golden latte this time with less honey because I wanted it less sweet. It was good but I think in the future regular sweetness is better.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I really do like Peet’s but this location every time I order (over 30 times) I change the temperature on my matcha latte to warm and they burn the milk so much that it burns my hand, please look at the option for milk temperature and stop burning the milk. Now I need to wait so long to drink it and my lunch will be over</Text>

Thursday March 21 at 7am credit card processing is down so only cash.
Peet's this rarely happens what your staff is empowered to do when it does is your brand.  This morning your brand failed.  So many of your morning customers are regulars so give them any drink on the house instead of saying we can't accept your credit card today.  Thiseans we walk out and go to the competition possibly once and possibly for weeks...</review>

The cashier misheard my order and got me a regular Cappuccino instead of Havana Cappuccino, but it's cheaper and tastes good. So no complaints.< /text>

<text>More seating in the outside than inside. No power on the outside. You could work on your laptop on a cloudy or hazy day; sunny days are too bright for that. You can find seating on the outside typically within the first ten minutes. Weekends and holidays tend to be busier than usual.<//text>< pics>

You can get a hot cup of coffee in the winter at Peets. You can't get a hot cup of coffee in the winter at Peets if you like cream with your coffee. It cools it right down to soup. Then they say policy prevents us from bringing it up to a decent temperature with our microwave. Corporate morons.< /Text>

Small location with very, very limited interior seating. They offer a few outdoor tables if thats your thing. Long lines but, move fairly quickly.</text>

Great coffee and this store in particular is very customer service oriented. They gave me a compensation drink once for them being two minutes late and I never made a fuss about it.</review>

Easy to get to location, good coffee, friendly staff, and plenty of places to sit outside to enjoy the summer.  Obviously plenty of parking because it's in a mall.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Pitts Coffee is delicious enough to be in Korea soon. I don't think of Starbucks.

<UserId.>109804395240083960749< /UserId.><text>(Translated by Google) I always drink peet's. Seriously, the taste of this room is not as good as other rooms. Just now when the clerk was indifferent and looking for money, the change fell from a height and I don’t say sorry for the consistent indifference. Discrimination because he smiled at the next group of white people, but I still believe that such people are only a minority! Most of the people are still very friendly. It is true that when you work, you should not take personal emotions. You should basically smile when you face the guests. A simple smile can make the world better!

(Original)
我一直都喝peet's  說真的這間的味道沒有其他間好 就在剛剛 店員態度冷漠 找錢的時候從高處落下零錢 掉了也不說抱歉 一貫的冷漠 我來美國這麼久終於感受到什麼叫種族歧視 因為他對下一組白人有了笑容 但是我還是相信 這種人只是少數！大部分的人都還是很友好 說真的工作的時候 不因該帶著私人情緒 面對客人基本微笑要放在臉上 簡單笑容能讓世界更美好！</text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Hilda’s makes the BEST pancakes (yummmmm...plus blueberry pancakes) ANYWHERE! Best in Marin, best I’ve ever had! They are buttery with crispy edges, not fat and doughy like other places. They are one of three places in the Bay Area that I would trust with scrambled eggs, making them fluffy and moist if you ask for them “soft”. They stock sugar free syrup for those of us that need it. The staff is warm and fun and friendly and really cares. They are always dependable and should be #1 on this list....seriously.<//Text>< pictures>

Now this is the type of place I think of when I say that I want “breakfast food”. We stopped here to get a quick bite and this was amazing! Super generous portions and at a really affordable price!<//review>

<Review>My husband and I got the chicken fried steak and an order of the German pancakes. We walked across the street to the park and sat down and ate and it was beautiful. Our food was hot and fresh and delicious.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>The eggs are the best things in the world! I have came here every Sunday with my grandparents since I was 4, and we have became great friends with a waitress there! Hilda's is simply the best breakfast place in downtown San Anselmo!</review>< date>

Really great food, strong coffee. They have a lot of unique menu items, eggs Benedict, scrambles, burgers. Sunday morning and we found an open table, so that was nice. Service could be better, a bit slow and we got no coffee refills! Would definitely go back.</text>

Old fashioned, charming, Americana diner with a hard working staff full of personality. Don’t expect any frills but an amazing traditional experience nonetheless. The illustrations on the wall are donated by George Lucas who can sometimes be spotted there drinking coffee and reading his newspaper.< /Review>

Every neighborhood needs a good greasy spoon.  This happens to be the spoon my girlfriend has gone for years and I understand why.  Friendly, happy staff, good food, and nothing fancy.  It's homey and I always feel comfortable.  Even our celebrity neighbors come here from time to time!

When I have a craving for pancakes the way my granny made, I go to Hilda's.  When I crave a good hangover cure or diner coffee and don't want to cook, Hilda's is there for us.</review>

My cousin took me to Hilda's to eat when I was visiting several years ago. The place felt very much like a restaurant back in my hometown. Very homey, very comfortable, a place where everyone knows your name. The food was out of this world, plenty of it and very reasonably priced. The service is great. The waitresses always have something to say, they recommend what they think you might like and they are always smiling.  It feels like extended family. Wish we had a similar place where I live now in Erie. Hope Hilda's is around for a long, long, long, long time.< /review>

I have been eating here for over 20 years.  The service is always excellent,  the staff friendly, and not above a bit of banter (sass them, they sass back!).  Oh, and the food is the best comfort food and breakfast anywhere in the county.  I often eat the Chef's Salad, which is enormous, piled so high that not another piece of lettuce will fit on the plate.< /Text>

<Text>Stumbled across Hilda's on a recent drive to San Anselmo. This place is about as mom and pop as they come. I almost ordered French toast but our very kindly waitress talked me into the pancakes, which I was assured Hilda's was famous for.

She wasn't kidding. These were seriously the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. Deliciously soft in the middle and then taking on a crispy crepe-like consistency as you approach the perimeter.

The whole experience makes this place worth a repeat morning breakfast visit to San Anselmo.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>Pretty typical greasy spoon, but we went here because of the rave reviews. My sausage scramble was fine, but my wife's huevos appeared to have Costco squeeze bag guacamole, and the hash browns looked soggy and unappealing. The one positive is you can swap the hash browns and toast for three pancakes, which were decent.< /Review>< Time>

<Text>Hands-down best breakfast in Marin County! Not to mention most affordable... The staff is very friendly. And if you're lucky on occasion you will see George Lucas eating breakfast there, apparently it's his favorite spot.

Ps... If you're a fan of corned beef hash like I am, Hilda's makes literally the #1 best CB Hash I've ever eaten!! I'm often torn between ordering the hash and eggs Benedict which is also amazing there so sometimes I go for their corn beef hash Benedict. :))< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Im new to the comic world so this was the first comic shop I have ever been in. The gentleman working was super sweet and very helpful. Even built my short box for me since I didn't know how. Yes I'm that much of a newbie. Will definitely shop here again when I'm in the area.<//Review>< UserId.>

If they don't have what you're looking for at one location they will check at the other location for you. They will bring it to your location or hold it for you to pick up. They offer pulls so you don't miss out. They have great staff who are knowledgeable and can offer fantastic recommendations. My family loves it!<//review>

Awesome place with a wide selection of comic books. Sizeable selection of action figures including Hasbro, Neca, Mezco, Pops, Mcfarlane, ShFiguarts, Mafex, Hot Toys.  The cashier was very amiable and even hooked me up with a free bookmark 👍<//text>

<Text>Great selection, especially if you like to tiptoe the line between "comics" and "art." Leef is good at recommending new things to read based on what you like, and there's a sort of lower-cost rent/library option for certain books, as well. There's also clearly an effort made to include indie and local artists, which I appreciate.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2ba23bbb857eb:0x3c8b91d0ab8b85de</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Love this place! The people who work here are great, the variety is vast, it's spacious and well-organized. Sometimes they play music and it's always a bop. Sometimes they have a show playing on the tv and it's always appropriately volumed and interesting. I really appreciate this shop and the folks who operate it. Without a doubt, my favorite comic book shop.</Review>

<Name>Jordan Burchette</Name><date>1597427303885</date><Rating>5</Rating><text>What's great about comic book shops is that there's no franchise template; each is a unique little snowflake. There are things you expect, but each proprietor has a different take on them. The Comic Bug sells new issues, back issues, games, toys and collected editions and presents them in a way that engenders the feeling of discovery that makes a great comic book shop.

There's the huge wall of new and recent issues, which leads you to a robust selection of back issues, which leads you to the store's signature bin of issue runs -- sequential comics packaged up in story lots at a fair discount. Further, their sales are fantastic, clearing out discounted back issues, graphic novels and other items at serious reductions. A hundred dollars might not be a lot for some people to spend in a single purchase, but it is for me and I came out of that place with probably $200 worth of merchandise.

Atop it all, the folks running it are delightful; engaging customers, offering sincere help and running in-store promotions that foster a fun, communal vibe. I wish I lived closer, because The Comic Bug is a textbook example of the classic comic book store.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Great neighborhood shop for comics and still in the hood!!  While I miss them as neighbors on 20th, the new Mission St. location is great. Wonderful selection for fans of all ages and the proprietor is great to chat with too. Oh, and did I mention their selection of enamel pins? Not to be missed.<//review>

A few months ago he Comic Bug, Inc. staff recommended me my first comic in years. I was in need of a new Spider-Man story to get into, and the staff talked with me and sold me on Ultimate Comics Spider-Man. This was the catalyst into my new hobby, and I'm very happy that Mission Comics is my local shop.< /review>

Great spot, I'm glad there are still stores like this left in LA. We're getting our kids into reading books and comics at an early age, and they have a wide variety of comics and toys. Sierra was very nice and helped me out a lot< /Review>

<Review>The Comic Bug, Inc. and Art has overtaken Isotope as my favorite comic shop in SF!  No mean feat, as Isotope is an excellent shop as well, but Mission Comics is both a great comic shop, interesting art space, and a down-to-earth place to sit and write.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Really solid collection of monthly comics and tons of TBPs in the back. Great little comic book store not too huge but not too small. Seems like a good place to start if you're just getting into comics.< /Text>

This is my goto spot for anything comic book related in the city. Parking has given me headaches many times though...which is why I even bother checking out other shops, but every time I just regret it and wish I just came here instead.< /Text>

<Text>Great comic store, has been here a looooong time.
I bought some of my first comics here.
The staff has always been friendly and knowledgable.
I remember as a kid, not having a lot of money, i looked around a lot trying to figure out what i wanted to spend my hard earned money on.
The guys here never minded. they encouraged me and loved my interest in comics.
Love this place. great shop for the community. Long live comic books<//Text><Time>1564681003810</Time>< user_name>

One of my favorite spots to go to. Always have stock on a lot of titles and staff is always great. If I can't find it in Manhattan Beach, I look for it here. And yes, I drive the 405 North just to come here. The comic bug has provided for almost 90% of my single issues, 80% of my series collections (graphic novels I suppose) and will continue to earn my money because of their genuine passion for comics and their down to earth service. If you don't find what you are looking for, you'll find something you didn't realize you were looking for.<//Review>

This is nicely kept with the latest in graphic novels and monthly comic books.  As the owner for his recommendations for starting with your own comic book collection.  Great place to look and browse the multitude of comics and art displayed around the store.<//text>

I've been going here for almost a year now. Ben and Scott are super friendly. The store is clean and organized. Bags and boards are free. There's lots of special events. Neighborhood parking is plentiful. Managing your pull list is simple.

Edit:
Still going years later. Still happy.</Text>

< Review>
I have buying my comics from here since I moved to Los Angeles in 2012. The staff is knowledgeable on the topic of comics. They are friendly, sociable, and carry a great conversation on most things comics. They know their repeat customers by name and comic preferences. If you are lucky, you might see people from the nearby movie studios show up. Also, they have connections to special movie screenings of select superheroes.  Also, if there is a comic book you want, but they do not carry, they can get.  This was helpful when I was looking for Voltron and Robotech. The place has wall-to-wall comics, merchandise, and limited edition items for your taste. Worth the visit and money.<//Review>

I go here all the time - the staff is friendly and knowledgable - It's full to the brim with all kinds of comics and collectables - plus I love size of the store itself cozy and old-timey . it's the first store I go to when I want something.</Review>

Amazingly beautiful little park. Very nice and clean. The neighborhood is quiet, clean and everyone is friendly. We will definitely be back. If you go here please make sure to leave it as you found it. It is a hidden gem ❤</Text>

There's a good amount of trash cans which is nice, and doggie poop bags stations. The field has frisbee golf thingies, and there's one of those mini library things which is cool. Plus some Pokéstops and a gym if you play Pokemon Go. The playground area is one of those "safe" kinds, which is too bad (not actually safer) and there's signs discouraging stuff like going up the slide instead of down 😒 It's nice having a park around; there's nothing special or interesting there though.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

Its a secret neighborhood playground. Its tucked so far in you could easily get lost..but on a positive note nobody is there usually. 2 play structures and swingset for both babies kids..and ya grown kids too. There is a table if fancy a party venue. Its nicely landscaped with a huge field in case you have pets that like to get the ball.<//Review>

<text>Well organized, well run office which I like first and foremost. They are digital ready so you get most of the interactions done via texts. The dentists are compassionate and knowledgeable and genuinely care about your dental health. Highly recommend.</text>< Pictures>

For those of you waiting until it is safe to get your dental work done. NOW is the time and THIS is definitely THE PLACE! (And, why can I only give 5 stars?!?!?!)    :)
Not only is the entire team 100% qualified, friendly, & helpful, but, they are also 100% committed to making each visit the best, most painless, & SAFEST dental visit EVER!
They've got the "covid protocols" down pat. From the second you walk in the door (spacing & plexiglass guards & face masks, etc.) through the treatment too (air purifiers, full protective gear, hand sanitizers, mouth rinse, etc.).
I had an emergency root canal in Jan (prior to me getting the vaccine) and they went out of their way to make sure I not only felt safe but WAS safe! I went back for my cleaning after I got my vaccine in April. And, now, I've gotten a failing crown fixed in May.
Seriously, if it is time (or past time) to get your dental work done, DO IT. Don't forget that healthy teeth help make a healthy you too.
This is the dental practice I've gone to since moving to CA. I've lived in four other states. This practice is the most up-to-date with the best techniques of ANY I've been to. And, to keep improving during the pandemic??? OUTSTANDING!!!!! (Can you tell I think very highly of them all?)  :)<//review>

Dr. Deol and his staff cannot be beat. They are very welcoming!!  they check on you periodically while you’re in the chair to see if you’re doing alright. Dr. Deol makes his own crowns right there in the office so you never walk out with a temporary.   He has a pleasant and caring chair side manner!!  They follow all COVID-19 protocol. Heck, Dr. Deol even diagnosed my sleep apnea! And right he was! Dr. Deol bought my former dentist’s practice and I thought nuts I’m gonna have to find a new dentist!  well I put things off and much to my great pleasure I didn’t have to find a new dentist,  he found me!

You will never be disappointed if you choose Dr. Deol and his staff, they are amazing!!!!!<//Text>

<Text>My great appreciation to Dr. Deol and his team.
They are extremely professional people. It is very clear that they love what they are doing and doing the best possible job.

I had a problem with my teeth and they scheduled an inspection the same day I called. And the treatment was done in the next two days. Everything is done in-house. The equipment is very cool and cutting edge.
I can not rate any lower than 5 starts - everything was excellent.
Thank you!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>Dr Deol has been my dentist for almost 5 years and not only is he great at what he does, but he is also a kind friend; such a great person to talk to.
Mrs Sadat, a recent hygienist just joined the team, is also a pro at what she does. My other family members have also recently decided to have Dr Deol as their dentist.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Not a patient...yet. Had an emergency, they made room for me during holiday season, got me in, patched me up, discussed long term options, and sent me on my way. Helped make an uncomfortable situation much more tolerable.< /text><username>Skip Yenchik<//username><user_id>114039707507123226787</user_id><Date>1608764384391<//Date></record>

Cleanings are always quick and easy with a minimal amount of discomfort. Due to the COVID situation they go almost overboard with precautions to keep everyone safe from infection. I highly recommend Oak Ridge Dental.< /Review><Time>1600794747227</Time><username>Martin Wibert<//username>< rating>

Let me start with, I am a total wimp when it comes to going to a dentist. But Dr. Deol and staff has always made my visits very comfortable and at easy. The office has great and new technology with very convenient times available for us working people since they are open as early as 7 am to 7 pm in the evening.. I definitely know I am great hands when it comes to my dental health. So thank you Oak Ridge Dental. 🤗<//review>

Oak Ridge Dental has their process down in this post-COVID-19 world. In addition to a touch less check in and checkout, they use an aerosol vacuum, fog the rooms and rotate patients through three rooms. I felt safe during my cleaning.<//Review>

<user_id>113433536829466020895< /user_id><text>Very rarely do I see doctors with passion and love for what they practice and how they "treat" (both for the condition and the patient), and I experienced it first hand with Dr. Rashpal Deol.

He is considerate and truly exceptional. I had consulted him first for a severe toothache infection (needing root canal) as a  walk in patient. His staff at the front end took effort to reach Doctor Deol and despite he being very busy that day was kind enough to see me and I fixed an appointment first thing on monday morning. Unfortunately my condition worsened with indescribable excruciating pain over the weekend. Despite his family needs He personally opened the clinic and attended to my condition empathizing my pain. This was such a kind act on his part. Truly I am blessed to have him as my dentist.

I am now going to get my entire family registered for checkups with Dr  Deol and He will the doctor I will refer to my friends.<//text>< time>

Dr. Deol was very considerate during the whole process, asking if I was comfortable, asking me to let him know if there was any discomfort.  He did two fillings and the process did not seem to take very long. Numbing is never plesant, but he uses new technology one of which is called "the wand" where he is able to numb only one tooth instead of your whole mouth. . When the treatment was done, I felt pretty good. Definitely a very good experience. A great dentist that I would highly recommend to everyone.<//review>< Time>

<Review>Best Dentist I have been to in 69 years
The exam was thorough -over 1 hour but not high pressure
Hygienist was amazing
She even put numbing gel on my gums because my teeth are so sensitive
I would recommend this dental practice

Recently I developed a horrible tooth ache on a Friday evening
Dr Deol came in on Saturday just for me a did an emergency root canal
I left town on Sunday for 9 days
He is the best dentist
He does root canals and dental implants

Wonderful dentist
Everyone remembers my name
Very professional</Review>< Response>

< Review>
The bean dip is worth the price of admission!

I hadn’t been here in a while, and the whole experience was OK. To be fair, it was a busy Saturday night, and being recently reopened was definitely a challenge, so I think they did their best. The staff was very nice and the bean dip was as awesome as I remember. The food? So-so. I think mine was sitting in the window for a while because the enchilada sauce looked dry and crusty on the side, the once melted cheese had solidified, and the beans were sort of crusty and dried out. The enchilada was also dry - the taco was good, though! And again, the bean dip and the salsa were amazing. I’d still go back, but I hope the kitchen gets itself in order so the experience can be more pleasant. And again, the staff were very nice and accommodating.<//Review>

We’ve been dining at Los Toros for over 30 years, and a pandemic won’t stop us from going as long as it doesn’t stop them.  It’s nice to have the option of dining in or out right now</Review>

I Love Los Toros! My first experience here was 1974, we had just moved to Chatsworth and our neighbors recommended this fine Mexican Restaurant. Their bean dip is very good is what they’re known for indeed delicious I always get the cheese enchilada taco combo. Great Place! <3</text>

The margaritas are great. Get a pitcher. Not as strong as they used to be but they were deadly so it's probably best this way & they're still potent & tasty.
The 'bull' meals are great. The 14th Bull is my favorite. If you haven't tried one, you oughtta.
Combo meals don't disappoint. Betta bleevit!

My family and I have been coming here for decades. The bean dip can't be beat. We ordered a burrito to split and I'm really glad that we did. It was huge! Great atmosphere and awesome staff. I highly recommend bringing friends to enjoy the delicious margaritas and the dip.<//Text>

As a healthcare worker, I take the CDC guidelines very seriously and this is the first time, we as a family went out since the pandemic started. We had all our groceries delivered and limited to going out ONLY for work. Since the regulations have lifted and our positivity rate has gone down to 2.4% we decided to go celebrate my sisters 15th birthday. We called ahead of time to ask what their regulations were, we specifically told them we are a party of 7 who live in the same household. They said since we were a big party we could sit together but we had to sit outdoor. Once we got there we sat outside we realized it was very cold, even with the sweaters we had on, so we asked them to turn on the heater they had for the outside. (It didn’t help at all) They said they turned it on but it wasn’t until we were leaving (45mins later) that they realized it was out of gas. We waited a long time for the food and the drinks took long to be refilled even when we asked multiple times. And if that wasn’t bad enough to our surprise a staff member came to pull our tables apart because “cdc guidelines mandate that we can only sit parties of 6 on the outdoor eating area” ironically enough they only pulled our tables apart by 3 feet. Also the other tables were not spaced 6” apart which has been the main rule from CDC. In any case the food was over cooked, the rice was hard,  the beans were congealed, and the margaritas we ordered were extremely  watery and bland. I still left a 15% tip because it’s not the servers fault that the management has failed them. They  needs to rethink their game plan. Unfortunately, this is a hard pass for me I will not return and I will definitely not recommend this place .

Sincerely,
Party of 7 from the same household</text>

This place is great!! Show up hungry, the portions here are big.  The chips come with salsa and bean dip. The bean dip is excellent.  I typtally get their hard shell chicken tacos which are always really good.  The wait staff is always friends, the service is always good.  I've been coming here for years and will continue to come here in the years ahead.</Text>

This place is typically good. But last week i called in an order they said it would take 35 mins which is fine. When we arrived i was told theres at least 10 orders ahead and they dont know how long my order will take. We cancelled our order and left. By reading others comments it was probably a wise decision.< /Text>

Very very good set up a bunch of tables in the parking lot with this virus going on actually very nice outside probably pick that before eating inside nice and cool had some light setup service and food good as always. I can't even tell you when the last time I had a couple margaritas in the parking lot was. I actually ordered the food to go and Doris said while I think I got a table for you outside and I gave that a try worked out perfect.<//review>

Nice location. Came because my family saw this restaurant on Hell’s Kitchen and wanted to check it out. It has 4 parts to the restaurant which was very interesting, not sure if they are still adapting to a larger crowd or need more staff but they did good. I ordered beef tacos and it came with rice and beans</Review>

Love this place! It's a true gem in the Chatsworth restaurant scene. Cadillac Margaritas are a must. So flavorful and they don't skimp on the salt rim. Tableside guacamole (not tableside during COVID; made to order in their kitchen) never disappoints. Huevos rancheros, combos, specials have all been delicious. Never had a bad meal here. Patio seating has good umbrella coverage. Staff super nice and seems to remember the regulars. Well worth the extra couple miles to dine here.< /review>

The tortilla chips with warm bean dip and salsa were a nice snack while we checked out the menu. I had the Mar y Tierra, it was excellent but could have been even better if the server had bothered to ask me how I wanted the steak cooked. The shrimp is wonderful but you have to like garlic and cheese. To finish it of the plate also included a tasty rice dish and salad.< /review>< Pictures>

RUDE AND THEY ARE NOT GOOD AT OUTSIDE DINING. VERY UNORGANIZED, VACANT SEATING BUT AN HOUR AND HALF WAIT! GOT TIRED OF STANDING AND THERE WAS A CLEARLY AN AVAILABLE TABLE (REMANDED VACANT FOR A MINIMUM OF AN HOUR!! WE SAT THERE UNTIL MR. MASK/ SHIELD CAME YELLING AT US LIKE WE WERE 5 YEARS OLD  AND WERE CARRIERS OF SMALL POX! COME ON. ITS NOT THAT SERIOUS THAT WE SAT WITHOUT YOUR BLESSING! SORRY TO SEE YET ANOTHER BUSINESS BUY THIS FEAR MONGERING AND MEDIA ENHANCED NEWS THAT SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE. THIS RESTAURANT NEEDS SOME REORGANIZATION AFTER THEY ALL GO TO BETTER ATTITUDE CAMP!< /Review>

<Text>Come for the bean dip. Stay for the main course. There are several rooms each with a different feel. There are cozy booths ideal for intimate conversations over a great meal. Or family sized tables for larger groups. If you feel like grabbing  a drink with friends then hit the bar.

A year or so back the show was featured on Gordon Ramsay's "To Hell and Back" television show and it was not a good look for the place, but we still found ourselves coming back (perhaps stupidly). Has been and always will be a Chatsworth and San Fernando Valley classic.< /review>< gmapID>

< review>
Los Toros is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in LA. The menu is extensive so there is something for everyone and the food is consistently great. Recent interior updates are nice and still maintain the original vibe. The service is mostly great but they have an off night now and again but who doesn't. Highly recommend Los Toros for both authentic Mexican dishes as well as American Mexican dishes. Definitely worth the trip to Chatsworth.< /review>

Try the Mole!! The food here is delicious and the atmosphere is great too! I've sat in the dining area and I've sat in all 4 bars and it's always a great time. The prices are decent and the staff are courteous. They even have an all you can eat brunch with an omelette station and a waffle station!!< /text>

Los Toros has several different experiences under one roof including a dining floor that feels like an open-air market, an energetic bar with TVs playing current sports matchups, a quaint area decorated like cottage interiors, and a back room for larger groups.

The food is of high quality with decent portions and very reasonable prices, and they are willing to prepare meals for those who may have food allergies (gluten-free, in our case), though the menu doesn't currently note it. We have never been disappointed with service or the food.

Parking is likely the largest challenge, as Los Toros retains a steady yet manageable stream of guests. Valet is available, and there is ample street parking immediately nearby.

With all to like, it's easy to see why Los Toros is a community favorite with a draw from the rest of Los Angeles.< /Text>

They got our order wrong. When they finally brought the correct order the food was cold. The taquitos were dry and hard, not fresh. Had to wait 20 minutes  just to get my beverage refilled. When they finally brought it they brought the wrong beverage. Won’t be coming back here.< /text>

I have not eaten there for 7 or 9 years. This is the only Mexican restaurant gives you bean dip as other Mexican restaurants gives you chips & salsa. If you enjoy the bean dip wish chips it’s highly recommended. I feel like eating there tomorrow I cannot wait to enjoy the bean dip with chips. I will order on the menu to see what I will have also it would be nice if they have specials for tacos on Tuesdays I am wondering if they do if not that’s okay too. I am also wondering what nonalcoholic beverages do they have? I remember 7 or 9 years ago the food there and bean dip with chips was one of the best I ever had. I have no complaints about Los Toros. When I go there tomorrow for my lunch I hope I will be satisfied like I did before as I remember it. Other Mexican restaurants are different, but Los Toros is one of my favorite restaurants even those I have not had it for 7 or 9 years ago. I am craving Los Toros. I feel tomorrow is the perfect day for me to go there.<//text>

The margarita was weak, the waiter was not very attentive. Hopefully it was just because they had a busy night. I'll go back & give it another try.
5/5/17-This is a different review. I went here again, the hostess was a guy who was rude & wouldn't make eye contact. It was Cinco de Mayo, so I went for lunch, the wait wasn't too long, the food was great & the margaritas were good this time, they were pretty strong. I guess it depends what day, & time you go.< /Text>

<Review>The renovation to the first two dinning halls is nice. The third one with the booths could be renovated. So what has changed since Gordon's visit? The menu doesn't have any advertising and not much else. The food does taste a little better. So if you loved this place before you'll still love it and if not well don't come.

Always great food. One of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley. Always packed especially Friday and Saturday nights. So expect a wait to be seated and to get food. The great margaritas make the wait easier.

The bean dip is highly addictive.<//Review>< Pictures>

Since the weekends here generate a brunch menu (not the normal lunch menu), we chose a pork based dish w/eggs. She had the Huevos Rancheros and I had the Sopa carnitas. We also had guacamole (best I've ever had) and some extra (fresh) tortillas. Food was delish. This is not  a typical Mexican restaurant (that overfeed you). It is a gourmet Mexican/American food place. The food was very skillfully cooked, excellently prepared and meticulously served. And the food was very reasonably priced too (total bill for 2, without drinks was about $60. We also had iced-tea, which was also very good (non fru-fru, just plain unflavored/unsweetened).< /text>

Appetizer includes bean dip along with the typical chips and salsa (nice touch). Veggie burrito was good. I'm glad to find another Mexican restaurant with some good-tasting vegetarian options. Manager came by to make sure everything was fine. Also, they don't charge for soda water :-)</review>

<review>It was like returning home to an old friend! Me and my family have been going here for years and particularly like the dim booths but the new interior that the front was very refreshing as well.  The chips and bean dip were excellent as always. My aunt and I were able to try the new grilled swordfish featured in Gordon Ramsay's 24 hours to h*** and back edition of this restaurant! It was very delicious and very reasonably priced! I only wish that they could have promoted this menu more it was only displayed on thin pieces of paper with no reference from the staff unless asked about.  Gordon Ramsay really deserves more credit!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQCTZBPqwIB2Ax3cLRR7xCX2uO24WsaYQaQNyM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

<review>Ford is HORRIBLE. overpriced and poorly made. This place is only good for its bar, and even that is ehhh... alright. I don’t recommend this place for the food, at all. I ordered Camarones a la Diabla and when I got my order, it was THE worst, only 6 small measly shrimp, and a huge side of veggies?? The plate looked so mediocre, it was such a disappointment. And same thing for other dishes, it’s all mostly rice and beans, which I can make at home.
OK place for drinks, THUMBS DOWN for food.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Great food (except guacamole) but bad service. Restaurant smelled very strong of pine sol, which is not pleasant when eating. The “at the table guacamole“ had way too much lime in it and something is just different. Think there are many staff members that are idle while customers needs are not being met. Service just seemed really bad compared to last time we were here. Sad, i really liked this place before.😒<//text>

Parking during the day usually has valet and can be challenging in the evenings especially Friday or Saturday night. I recommend taking an uber/lyft here if possible, or carpooling. Otherwise you will likely have to park in the residential area. This is the type of place you go to for the atmosphere and the memories (aka drinking margaritas with your friends). The food is not amazing but it's not bad either. I recommend coming here for drinks and supplementing that with their food :). It can get really loud here (again because there is lots of margarita drinking happening here). You should order the House margarita in the Pitcher because it's a better price than just doing it by the glass. Love this place and have had lots of good times here.<//text>

<text>The margarita was weak, the waiter was not very attentive. Hopefully it was just because they had a busy night. I'll go back & give it another try.
5/5/17-This is a different review. I went here again, the hostess was a guy who was rude & wouldn't make eye contact. It was Cinco de Mayo, so I went for lunch, the wait wasn't too long, the food was great & the margaritas were good this time, they were pretty strong. I guess it depends what day, & time you go.</text><Rating>3<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

<review>The decor and menu have been upgraded. The food was fresh and delicious. I had beef and cheese enchilada with refried beans and Spanish rice. Chicken tostada was made with all fresh ingredients. Really good! Their chips, salsa and bean dip are still delicious. Glad we went. Well worth the trip!</review>< pics>

So what has changed since Gordon's visit? The menu doesn't have any advertising and not much else. The food does taste a little better. So if you loved this place before you'll still love it and if not well don't come.

Always great food. One of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley.  Always packed especially Friday and Saturday nights. So expect a wait to be seated and to get food. The great margaritas make the wait easier.

The bean dip is highly addictive.

The people writing great reviews were likely enamored by the service. I ordered the food for delivery. The steak burrito was okay. The bean dip was okay. The salsa was okay at BEST. I prefer a chunkier salsa. This was like water. It lacked real flavor. I would go elsewhere for good Mexican food.</Text>

Los Toros Mexican Restaurant is iconic in the valley and everyone should eat here. There is something amazing for everyone. Great date place, great for kids, great for casual lunches and a really great happy hour. The food is fantastic and the staff is even more special. They are friendly, attentive and happy all the time. We LOVE Los Toros!!<//Review>

Friendly service with great atmosphere. Lovely place to sit and visit. A shift change was happening, server that was leaving forgot about us, new server was awesome. Margaritas so so, food okay. Will go there again for the atmosphere😊< /Text>

I have been eating here for years. I eat here with my kids, I eat here with large groups of friends and I love to eat here for a date night with my husband. The bar is wonderfully dark and the margaritas are delicious. The service is and has always been attentive, kind and enthusiastic. Great restaurant!!</Review>

When we arrived, there was no hostess in front. Waited five minutes until I asked for someone to help us and 10 other people waiting to be seated. The service needs improvements slow and the food was okay this time. The food is usually very good. But the Guacamole was excellent!!< /Review>

<review>Seems like the dishes are being made different and presented differently. This has been just recently. I need more trips to decide if I enjoy the new ways. If you have been a long term customer as my family has you may see the differences. We find the the new dictionary menus a little tough with all that advertising in them and there so thick that it is hard to find what your looking for. Good food, service is good.

Bean dip!! Love restaurants that do this. Love the building. I had the Jalisco which reminded me of Armandos Special at the old Arco Iris in HLP, which I liked better. Still, I plan on coming back soon. Food was good, I'm just longing for an old favorite.<//Review>

The food was good the service was okay or less. Staffed seemed more concerned about interacting with each other vs. Waiting on the guest, it was the Rams playoffs so I can understand the distraction.< /text>

Went for the first time cause we wanted fajitas. It was delicious. Really good serving sizes and flavor. I love that they give beans with the chips and not just salsa, that was cool. Definitely going back again.<//Text>

<review>First time visit about 4pm. The service was great, the crowd light. The food was very, very good. The only drawback is the size of the menu, which is very large and somewhat redundant. We left at about 5:30, just as the dinner rush was beginning. Overall, I was very impressed. Thanks for a memorable experience!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

We came with our baby and they sat us all the way in the back where it's very loud although there was tons of space at other sections. Moments later another couple with a kid an baby were sat next to us. Makes me wonder if bringing a baby had something to do with it.  Took them more than 15 min to take our order   It is very americanized and not authentic mexican flavor.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><rate>1<//rate>< date>

Huge menu, excellent margarita choices (and decently priced). Call ahead for seating or plan to wait, because this is one of the more popular places to eat in the Valley, and wait times for seating (especially on weekends) can be long. The bean dip is excellent.< /review>

Can a menu have too many items on it? Los Toros says, NO! Literally hundreds maybe a thousand or so items on a very thick binder menu. The food is always tasty and the price is right. The waiters weren't just good they were enthusiastic! They got a big tip from us. My one star off is that the room where we were sat was too dark. Very hard to see the menu or anything. We had our phones out with the flashlights on. Dim is one thing but this was a level below that.< /Text>

The waiters are bad they want to do 1 check for a party of 12 people and only 1 credit card.The beans  are can beans we didn't have silverware we ask the waiter few times took long time to serve food..we really didn't  like the food no seasoning,  the fajitas  & tacos  no taste.really why this place still open after the bad reviews they have few months ago.

I haven't been there in a long time but watched Gordon Ramsey episode and decided to come back. While we waited for our server to show up we see a waiter standing to the side twiddling his thumbs. Turns out that was our waiter. Ordered the chicken mole it was burnt and terrible. None of the items that Gordon suggested were on the menu. This is southern California there are so many better choices for Mexican food i suggest you try them.</text>

<date>1576685921347</date><Text>I've been going to Los Toro's my entire life. I always get the same thing. Carne asada with an enchilada. It's always good, and always tastes exactly the same. That is until last night. I always defend Los Toro's when people say, it's gotten worse over the years, but I can no longer defend it. I ate in the bar, which might've been my first mistake. I had to stare at every employee just to get service. The bean dip, which they're famous for, was thick, not very hot, and given in A VERY small bowl. The carne asada was overcooked to well done, even though I asked for medium rare. I asked for no rice all beans, got a tiny bit of beans with and like a pound of rice. Then the enchilada wasn't even hot enough to melt the cheese on the inside or on top. Very sad. I'll go back to give them one more try, but maybe my friends are right and there is no defending them anymore.<//Text>< pics>

Mediocre food. Ordered chilaquiles and enchilada special and were very plain. We came with our baby and they sat us all the way in the back where it's very loud although there was tons of space at other sections. Moments later another couple with a kid an baby were sat next to us. Makes me wonder if bringing a baby had something to do with it.  Took them more than 15 min to take our order   It is very americanized and not authentic mexican flavor.<//text>

I used to love going here for their lunch special complete with a great house margarita. It gives you a hard shell beef taco, rice and beans. Bummed that they served the margarita in the smallest glass ever. (Something they have never done before...) Their bean dip is delicious and addicting. Service was a bit slow. But have to say that I was very pleased to see that they are employing someone with special needs. Hats off to you for giving this gentleman the opportunity to earn a living with dignity.<//Text>

We go for lunch (almost every Friday) and sit in the sunny room as soon as you enter. Other rooms are darker and less comfortable.
The servers are friendly and you usually get pretty good service.</review><Response>None< /Response>< rating>

<user>112509210362668820607<//user><Text>Big restaurant, occupancy over 200 people. Friday night wait time..... still need 45-60 minutes. They don't take reservation either. :(

2 bar area, first come first serve. However, over crowded. Impossible to find a seat.

The Service: Once seated, server was attentive. Food was served quickly.

The Food: Food quality is really so-so.

Beef taco - beef is dry, taco shell is not crunchy. Side dish rice is overcooked.
Tamale - too doughy. only a little bit of meat.
Enchilada - not enough cheese, majority tortilla< /Text><Rating>2< /Rating><Time>1531616040768<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Food was ok, I mean wife was all thrilled about it after seen chef Gordon Ramsey flipping the place on tv. But it looks like they just remodel the front main entrance and none of the dishes Gordon came up with were available.. also they area they put us in was so dark I could barely see what I was eating.. but very disappointed with tamales in this place.. i swear these tamales are the same as you'll but at store in the frozen section.. I'll give them another shot in future..</review>

Entrance in the rear. Parked in front didn't see any signs until we got to the front door and it said entrance in rear. Very large parking lot in rear. Good food and attentive staff. Very interesting floor plan with different dining areas I liked it a lot. I was here for a quick bite but I'll be back to try some other items. I had the enchilada lunch special and it was very good.</Review>

Food was ok, I mean wife was all thrilled about it after seen chef Gordon Ramsey flipping the place on tv. But it looks like they just remodel the front main entrance and none of the dishes Gordon came up with were available.. also they area they put us in was so dark I could barely see what I was eating.. but very disappointed with tamales in this place.. i swear these tamales are the same as you'll but at store in the frozen section.. I'll give them another shot in future..</Review>

I have been coming here for years and It is as good as ever. They have free valet parking. If you dont know they give out free bean dip with their chips and salsa which is a very nice touch in my opinion.  The food of course is very good. I also think they make a pretty good Cadillac margarita.< /Text>

2 bar area, first come first serve. However, over crowded. Impossible to find a seat.

The Service: Once seated, server was attentive. Food was served quickly.

The Food: Food quality is really so-so.

Beef taco - beef is dry, taco shell is not crunchy. Side dish rice is overcooked.
Tamale - too doughy. only a little bit of meat.
Enchilada - not enough cheese, majority tortilla< /Review><UserId.>112509210362668820607</UserId.>< gmap_id>

The chairs had dirty stains on them my first glass of water was also dirty. Place was loud when I was there, the good thing was the food I ordered which was the enchiladas. They need to update their chairs and maybe the tables.<//Text>

We go for lunch (almost every Friday) and sit in the sunny room as soon as you enter. Other rooms are darker and less comfortable.
The servers are friendly and you usually get pretty good service.</review>< name>

Very good Mexican restaurant with authentic food and drinks. Try the Papa Nick's margarita on the rocks made with your favorite tequila. The ubiquitous chips and salsa is served a warm house bean dip along with salsa.</review>

The drinks are made to perfection. They need to learn how to make Mexican food. I had a carnitas chimichanga burrito and it was extremely terrible. I could make the food better and I'm not Mexican.</Text>

Always plenty of food and choices. Lots of room therefore a fast sit down. Good margaritas... but which are served in a regular beer glass.. which takes away from the experience of Mexican tradition..at a very traditional Mexican ambiance restaurant, go figure!!.Good portions.< /review>

If you haven't tried the "Papa Nick's" Margarita, do yourself a favor and enjoy a real treat. If you are in a group, order a pitcher.< /review>

Place has great food, wonderful atmosphere, amazing beers and other alcohols, great happy hour options, and great lunch options. The only setback is you're going to wait if you don't have a reservation or even seated inside because there's so many people even with the number of waiters they have. Still, always recommend going there, and always get more bean dip!</Text>

Love this restaurant! Food is amazing, drinks are delicious (try the mango daiquiri, omg, they are so good!). Service is good, and prices are very reasonable, especially for the amount of food (my dinner was enough for three meals).
I strongly recommend to come early to avoid waiting.</review>

The drinks are always amazing and the bean dip they give you with the chips and salsa is absolutely addicting. However, I know that when we come to this place that the service is inconsistent and it's not always clean. The food is always on point but there are times when we wait a long time to get seated, the waiters are not attentive even when it appears that there are plenty of tables open. This last visit, the server was great and we were seated immediately but the bathrooms needed cleaning and the bar areas were messy. I give it a three due to the inconsistency between visits but if they're able to work that out, I'd give them 4-5 stars.< /Text>

Where we were seated in the very back of the restaurant in booths, they were a bit cramped and too near the service area.  I recommend sitting in the front of the restaurant for more leg room.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Food is good. Service is great as well.

Lunch special is knd of a scam. Up charge for meat or vegetables. Meaning, if you order a burrito, it's bean and cheese.

Veggie burrito is not even an option. $1.50 up charge for any meat.

They will not tell you about this at all. Probably won't come back just on principle. It makes for an awkward experience and everyone is on the defense.< /text>< pics>

Sorry no stars .... waiter was bad had no utensils or napkins.  They brought our food and had to ask for a fork to eat our food. The food was not fresh , no flavor and it was cold. Honestly i do not understand hiw people say that this the best. No authentic mexican flavor what so ever. Never coming back!!!< /review>

<review>A regular customer for over ten years.... I've enjoyed their food and Mexican tradition with music. On my visit on 8/5/19 they have change to rock n roll english music and have taken away the Mexican experience of food and nice mexican music. Cmon i can hear rock n roll anywhere, i come to your restuarant for the fine food and a nice get away for that "I'm in Mexico" feeling. Joselito's here i come. Los Toros please change your name to Hispanic dining with that american appeal. Good food bad atmosphere. A 5 star would be marked here, but they seem ashamed of their heritage</review><Date>1565064281971<//Date><Gmap_id>0x80c29cc9de2f3a95:0x30c32f9c8569aeec<//Gmap_id><user>106127521467090149155<//user><username>Hugo Daniel</username><rate>2< /rate>< pics>

Too bad the LOWEST I Can give this place is still 1 ☆. If you are a single woman trying to eat alone,  be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes to order.  And that's only after waiting 10 minutes to get your own menu.  I'm sick and tired of being treated like a second class citizen just because i choose to dine alone.  If you are lucky enough to have a Y chromosome,  I'm sure this place is great.  Too bad I'll never know.<//text>

Love the food!  Hate how noisy it is.  Service is and always has been so so.  Been going there for over 35 years.  Went from little neighborhood place to a crowded large restaurant.  I still love their food so I go but not nearly as much as I used to go.</Text>

The drinks are always amazing and the bean dip they give you with the chips and salsa is absolutely addicting. However, I know that when we come to this place that the service is inconsistent and it's not always clean. The food is always on point but there are times when we wait a long time to get seated, the waiters are not attentive even when it appears that there are plenty of tables open. This last visit, the server was great and we were seated immediately but the bathrooms needed cleaning and the bar areas were messy. I give it a three due to the inconsistency between visits but if they're able to work that out, I'd give them 4-5 stars.</review>

A spacious restaurant with excellent service and good food.  I had a chili relleno and enchilada combo that was very tasty.   Where we were seated in the very back of the restaurant in booths, they were a bit cramped and too near the service area.  I recommend sitting in the front of the restaurant for more leg room.</Text>

<time>1560143418972<//time><Text>Margaritas are awesome. Everything else not so much. Los Toros opened in 1971. Theres 4 distinct sections. All the way in the back is the oldest section, where the kitchen is. Its dark, old, and theres always a waiter walking by that isnt yours. Theres the room with no roof, the bar, and the first room you walk into is the newest. The waiters make good money here so no one ever quits. So your waiter is going to be old. The food is the same. Dont let the episode of Kitchen Nightmares fool you. As soon as Ramsey left they started serving the same glop. I guess this passed for authentic Mexican in the 70s now its just blech. But the Margaritas are nuclear. A pitcher for 2 people should be sufficient to get one of you a DUI.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c29cc9de2f3a95:0x30c32f9c8569aeec<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Too bad the LOWEST I Can give this place is still 1 ☆. If you are a single woman trying to eat alone,  be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes to order.  And that's only after waiting 10 minutes to get your own menu.  I'm sick and tired of being treated like a second class citizen just because i choose to dine alone.  If you are lucky enough to have a Y chromosome,  I'm sure this place is great.  Too bad I'll never know.</Review>

Family favorite for over for  40 years . Unfortunately the food has declined in the few years. We haven't been back for some time now. Our family spent many celebrations there ,from new births in the family to weddings, birthdays, etc. We wish they would be the same as in the past years because we have had great food and memorable times there.</Text>

This place is fun for the authentic Mexican atmosphere but the food lacks quality. It always has. The local Chatsworth residents love this place. It is packed on Fridays and the weekends. They are famous for their bean dip.<//text>

There were three guys at bar, and it took forever to order my food. They came with bean dip and no chips.  Then they came with drinks and took forever to come back to get my food order. I had to flag them down. I don't like when I have to flag down a server for service.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

The food and service was amazing and the michelada was out of this world. The only downfall was listening to a loud, obnoxious couple complain and talk about leaving a "scathing review" over them not getting a text for a coupon that they wanted to use.  I feel bad for the staff that had to put up with these people.</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>What a rip-off! I ordered the pescado asado, which was a small piece of swordfish with a dismal salad and terrible rice, and the way they served me was a huge disappointment...

The bloodline was still on the fish! The bloodline is not edible and as it was small, and for $17.95, it was hardly anything to eat! And the so-called salad that was included, was basically two pieces of iceberg lettuce with ONE slice of tomato.

My son had the beef flautas, and at first, they seemed huge but as he ate them, they were dry and the "little bit of" beef it had, was only in the openings at the top and at the bottom.

My husband had the carne asada plate and he was ok with the steak, but the rest of his plate was not  good... He had the chile relleno and the chile itself was a bit on the bitter side??

The rice was not great, it was 'off' in taste, and the pinto beans were from cannned beans and not fresh tasting, with way too much cheese over it, (where were the beans???)...

I complained to the waitress about my swordfish plate, and I saw her talk to the manager, who was younger than her, and he seemed unconcerned and careless, and he didn't even bother to apologize about the swordfish, which was the only thing I complained about to her...

It really wasn't her fault, but the idiotic manager on duty, in his immaturity should at least have approached us. I guess he figured his restaurant was top quality, and we were too insignificant to acknowledge.

Bottom-line: The food is not quality, you might get quantity but not great authentic food. Don't waste your money here, instead go to a true Mexican food place in Reseda... Las Fuentes... Now that's good food! And not expensive and super-authentic!

I don't understand why or how people gave this location any good reviews! I honestly went by the reviews and I was extremely disappointed at the end... Maybe most of them go there for quantity, and for sure you will get that... But ask yourself, why stuff yourself with high fat, low quality? I would rather have smaller portions and with quality!

So think about it and be aware!</Text>< pics>

< Review>
Went in with a group of people to party for the end of our year school time and the service and Staffing was really done very well. The food from what I ate was really good. And so was the tequila. Only part I had a little problem with is the pre-made and pre poured out of the gallon jug margaritas. Totally recommend this place and they've been around for years and go back for more.< /Review>

<review>The place was only half full more than an hour before closing but no one would come seat us. So we went walking to find someone or a table and ended up touring the entire place, even the closed off section due to space not needed. Finally sat in the bar area at a table taller than me with bar stools. Had to flag down someone for a menu. Won't be returning.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Three stars for the delicious ly strong ass house margarita! I love love their pitcher of margaritas and at a little over twenty dollars, its a great deal! The food on the other hand isn't that great! Ordered the sampler platter and it was a waste of money! I did like their beam dip and Salsa tho.< /Text>< pics>

Margaritas are much to strong.  Happy hour price was 11 or a pitcher for 27.
House margaita was gross.< /review>

<text>Used to be our go-to place for evening meals.  Seems to be slipping a bit.  The prices are still good, but sometimes now the food is lukewarm when it gets to the table, and twice the drinks were downright awful.  If all you want is some straight-up "traditional" Mexican-American food and a cold beer, then it's a good spot.  If you're looking for fancy or special, this is no longer it.
That being said, the chicken chimichanga is pretty damn good.
Be prepared for a wait, and a bit of a parking challenge.  The place is still pretty popular.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Happy hour prices are excellent we usually gt a pitcher of pacifico for 10$ and then they got tacos for a dollar but they fry the tortilla and it aint tht small tortilla its normal size but with 2 for 2$ its worth it. And the servers and bouncers are all on point as far as customer satisfaction and security goes< /Review>

My cousin lives up the street  and we have been coming to this place for over two decades but yesterday we waited over 35 minutes to be seated and then another 40 minutes to receive our food  and boy was I disappointed the food was cold and tasted stale and my girlfriends food was worse than mine really cold and terrible and I thought after Gordon Ramsay‘s 24 hours to hell and back show would have fixed the problem if you don’t know what I’m talking about you could see it on YouTube or possibly On Hulu I Informed both the waiter and the wife of the one and walked out very disappointed wasted my whole Friday night I will think twice of going back!<//Text>

<text>What a rip-off! I ordered the pescado asado, which was a small piece of swordfish with a dismal salad and terrible rice, and the way they served me was a huge disappointment...

The bloodline was still on the fish! The bloodline is not edible and as it was small, and for $17.95, it was hardly anything to eat! And the so-called salad that was included, was basically two pieces of iceberg lettuce with ONE slice of tomato.

My son had the beef flautas, and at first, they seemed huge but as he ate them, they were dry and the "little bit of" beef it had, was only in the openings at the top and at the bottom.

My husband had the carne asada plate and he was ok with the steak, but the rest of his plate was not  good... He had the chile relleno and the chile itself was a bit on the bitter side??

The rice was not great, it was 'off' in taste, and the pinto beans were from cannned beans and not fresh tasting, with way too much cheese over it, (where were the beans???)...

I complained to the waitress about my swordfish plate, and I saw her talk to the manager, who was younger than her, and he seemed unconcerned and careless, and he didn't even bother to apologize about the swordfish, which was the only thing I complained about to her...

It really wasn't her fault, but the idiotic manager on duty, in his immaturity should at least have approached us. I guess he figured his restaurant was top quality, and we were too insignificant to acknowledge.

Bottom-line: The food is not quality, you might get quantity but not great authentic food. Don't waste your money here, instead go to a true Mexican food place in Reseda... Las Fuentes... Now that's good food! And not expensive and super-authentic!

I don't understand why or how people gave this location any good reviews! I honestly went by the reviews and I was extremely disappointed at the end... Maybe most of them go there for quantity, and for sure you will get that... But ask yourself, why stuff yourself with high fat, low quality? I would rather have smaller portions and with quality!

So think about it and be aware!</text>< Pics>

Fan-freaking-tastic. Had the Chile Colorado. Tons of flavor, little mild for my tastes, but the habanero sauce fixed that right up.< /review>

I've been coming here for years consistently but recently within the last year my visits have been sparingly.. due to the food not being like it used to.  It looks like they just throw food together on a plate, toss it in the microwave and send it off. My last meal was a couple steak tacos and appetizer platter.. the tacos were horrible.. cold tortillas, plain taco with only meat and some lettuce and tomatoes on the side, had to drench it in salsa to get some flavor.  The drinks are always great though, you get a good bang for your buck and they are not shy with their liquor. I had a confrontation with the owner once during fight night and he was rude to me and my 7 yr old son.<//Review>

Just got home from the restaurant. Wanted to go to support them after Gordon Ramsey's visit. I was expecting to see the new item's on the menu.... didn't see any, asked someone that worked there if I missed them and they said no they don't serve the new item's that was on the show. We ordered steak and shrimp and the chicken tortilla soup. It was all terrible. The streak was over cooked, small and flat... it looked like a burnt hamburger patty and soup was luke warm by the time I got it. Im sad because I love this place and they have the most amazing bean dip, table side guac and drinks. Unfortunately that's the only thing i'll ever get there. Great place for drinks. To end the night my Fiancé has been in the bathroom since we got home, not feeling good after that weird steak.</Review>

Los Toros is a wonderful restaurant most of the time, food is always top notch, and the drinks are some of the best around. My friends and I have been coming here for the better part of a few years and during our last visit we were seated with a sever by the name of Doris, who was perhaps one of the worst severs I've ever have the displeasure of serving me. Not only did she fail to do a single quality check until after the food was long since eaten, but she clearly went out of her way to check on her other tables instead of us.
When we brought this problem to the manager attention, Nora, she told us that this sever had received praise and essentially told us we were wrong in bringing our issues forward.
While our experience was less than stellar we did want to compliment the young gentlemen who brought us our chips on a regular basis and the other gentleman who made our guacamole. We didn't get their names but they deserve kudos for their excellent attentiveness.<//Text>

It was my first time to this restaurant.  I love one of their salsa. Never had similar salsa anywhere before. I couldn't find many vegetarian/vegan options there on menu but server customized my order to make vegetarian tostada from veggie burrito. I didnt like that much but i will go there again to eat there salsa.<//review>

I came for lunch and ordered the Cilantro Ceasar chicken salad, I have to say, it was just ok.  The lettuce was chopped badly, there was way to much of the core in the salad.....and it looked old as well.  The chicken was decent, but a bit dry.  The dressing was really good, but nothing "ceasar" about it.  Overall, I would not order it again.  Although, I must say, the chips, salsa and bean dip were very good.
The staff was friendly, but it seemed like they'd rather be somewhere else.  I look forward to one day returning to try something else, some of the other plates I saw looked good.  Anyhow, this was just my observations on this visit.</text>

This place is dangerous.  Avoid!

For years I came to this restaurant with my children little did I know it had become a place of violence.  Last Cinco de Mayo 2018 I was there with my family for dinner and was attacked by 3 men inside the restaurant.  I was beaten, stomped on and dragged through broken  glass.

I am a woman in my 50s and was there to have a family dinner.   Imagine your mom being beat up by 3 men in a family restaurant!

Despite a number of security guards on duty no one was there to help me when these people became unruly.  I asked that 911 be called and the men who attacked me be arrestested.  The owner's allowed the men and 2 women to just walk away.

Though the restaurant had credit card receipts and video cameras all around, some how they were unable to assist police in identifying these violent criminals.  I was told by bus boy that one of the women was a regular and well known there.

Later the LAPD detective assigned to my case told me officers had been called there many times in the last year.  In fact there are other accounts on Yelp describing acts of violence at this establishment including one of a women being choked by some deranged man who wandered in.   According to that account restaurant security did not act at all and other diners had to subdue the man and get his bely from around the woman"s throat.  The diners detained him until LAPD arrived.  In my case management, it was told to me that security and management encouraged them to leave before police arrived.

As a consequence of my injuries I had to be taken to the ER for medical treatment and now have a big ugly scar on my leg.

It was a very traumatic experience made worse by the restaurant's unsympathetic and unhelpful attitude.

I would avoid this place.  Please DO NOT take your children here.

It is not safe.  Absolutely NOT SAFE.

Los Toros if you would like to challenge this review, I would be happy to post the police report. As well as the call sheet I obtained from LAPD detailing all the 911 runs made to your establishment in 2018.< /text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>My girlfriend and I have been here four times now and tonight we were disappointed. The service was excellent as always, Nellie is on top of things and we never have an empty margarita or salsa cup! We have ordered the same entree every time probably because they are so good but we are afraid of going home disappointed of the dinner we should've ordered!! I get the shrimp enchilada and my girlfriend gets a combination plate, the same every time. My shrimp were always crisp, crunchy and flavorful, they had a grilled flavor that came through the sauce and spices. Tonight was a different story, my shrimp were mushy and flavorless while her food had a crust on it from being under the heater too long. Even the margaritas were different, definitely not a potent as normal. This was a 5 star place till now. We will try again, maybe a new dish.

Ok, we went back this Sunday with some friends and though I did not order the shrimp enchiladas, my lunch was very good. Tried the Beef flautas and they were huge, very tasty. I had the remainder for dinner that night. My girlfriend had the Arroz con Camarones and her shrimp were perfect as well as her sister's shrimp fajitas!  Way to go Nick!<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>I walked in to this place and found it very colorful with nice ambiance.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I ordered the "Alambres Mexicanos" on recommendation from the waiter.  While waiting for dinner, I found the chips and salsa quite generic - Chips out of a bag and tomato sauce with small chucks of tomato. When the plate arrived, I found the marinated pork steak to be very dry and rubber-like with no flavor what so ever.  The beans and rice followed suit with no spices and no flavor.  I doused the entire meal with salt & pepper to try to rescue, but to no avail. On the food quality alone, I would rate this place a two (2).  However, I gave it a three (3) because the staff was a pleasure to deal with.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The margarita was the worst I ever had, the menu said fresh lime but it was clearly sour mix and not even good mix.  The food was bland, the only thing we liked was the guacamole.  Sad... I use to love this place,  seems like they're cutting corners.</text>

< Review>
One of the best places in the Valley to get authentic Mexican food. I've been going here for decades and the food is always excellent. The bean dip is good, the salsa is tasty, the machaca is very good. They've got great chimichangas, they've got excellent tamales, they even have a point to Vallarta shrimp cocktail which is more soupy than like your traditional shrimp cocktail. Even the chips are freshly made every day. Plus there Margarita will knock you out so be careful and only have one or two.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Food is delicious.  They start you off with chips,  been dip and fresh salsa: nummy!  I got the two beef taco combo,  tacos fruit ed and stuffed,  I mean stuffed,  with shredded beef,  salsa,  lettuce and lots of Mexican queso blanco.  Love the beans here.  Sat in the bar.  Bartenders took good care of me.  Only drawback is I had to park a block away.  Got here at 2pm on Sunday,  30 minute wait for a table.  They do offer valet parking.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Food is adequate, but overpriced for what you get. There is always a wait to be seated and to get your food. I wouldn't choose to go back, but sometimes other people want it. The bean dip has meat in it and there aren't many options for vegetarian people.<//Review>

One of the best places in the Valley to get authentic Mexican food. I've been going here for decades and the food is always excellent. The bean dip is good, the salsa is tasty, the machaca is very good. They've got great chimichangas, they've got excellent tamales, they even have a point to Vallarta shrimp cocktail which is more soupy than like your traditional shrimp cocktail. Even the chips are freshly made every day. Plus there Margarita will knock you out so be careful and only have one or two.< /text>

<Text>We were a party of three who dined here on a Wednesday.  I was sad to say the Food overall did not taste fresh.  The Meat in the Tacos, enchiladas and tamale just was ok.  I recently moved here from Phoenix and have yet to find a Mexican place that I really like.  The one I used to go to in Phoenix had the Best Fajitas with a Butter Jalepino sauce for the Shrimp and Chicken ones. Las Glorias Grill .   Will keep trying to find the one.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Delicious authentic mexican food. This is also a great place to catch a sports game in their bar area. The chips and salsa/queso dip is so good, just be careful not to fill up on it before your meal comes out. The guacamole is also really good and made fresh right at your table!<//Text>

If you ever want to sit down to some real authentic Mexican food, go to Los Toros, this place is the bomb Cinco de Mayo is unplugged they have a sports bar they have a seating area for just regular dinners or lunches and their waiters and waitresses are humble and keep it 💯 Los Toros, Chatsworth, West San Fernando Valley, SoCal rules 💪👊<//Text>

<review>Terrifying if you're a white person.
I suggested to my friend we go the Los Toros for dinner tonight. I was excited to share a favorite restaurant with a friend. Was ensued was one of the most terrifying experiences ever. As we sat waiting for our server, the couple next to us, the man appeared to become very agitated. He kept making political references to President Trump very loudly and was obviously agitated by us. He kept looking over at us stabbing his food and making racial comments. We tried to ignore him but he escalated his attacks calling us white trash. He repeated screamed at us threats and that he f-ing hates all white people. Then he said he was a former Marine and that gave him the right to say whatever he wanted. Then he said he'd been in "the pen" for 26 years so we should f-ing leave. His repeated claim of hating white people prompted someone to ask him to leave. He was screaming that we said bad things about Mexicans. We never did. Besides if we hated Mexicans why would we go to one of the oldest and most famous Mexican restaraunts in Los Angeles? His rant continued. I asked for the manager. She finally came over and ushered him out telling him he should go before we (my friend and I) call the police. Nora, the manager, even after the server and the poor kid making guacamole told the manager that we didn't do anything and the guy started it. She treated us like we were racist. I couldn't even eat my meal when it came I was so upset. Nora did nothing except tell him she's (me) gonna call the cops on him. Which wasn't true. The surrounding patrons were floored and all told Nora we didn't do anything. Nora said and did nothing. There was no apology. Sad I used to love this restaurant. My late in laws and I used to enjoy many dinners there. Now, I will NEVER go back. Nora was rude and never apologized. We paid, yes they still had the nerve to charge us, and left. This is a restaurant people, not a political debate place. So sad to see this restaurant support racism.</review><Date>1521427332395<//Date>< pics>

<user_name>Arthur Wong< /user_name><text>Not the best Mexican restaurant for Mexican Food. But a lot of history here and one of the oldest and longest standing Mexican restaurants in the san fernando valley. As long as I have been alive which is 33 years. It might have been here longer, but as long as I have been alive I have seen this Los Toros around. Los Toros is most famous for their margaritas and busy nights. Parking is always hard to find and getting a table is even harder. It gets super busy and boy if you want to eat here, better come here during the day. This is also the best place for bean dip. I have not had a better bean dip anywhere else that compares to Los Toros. I have been here on my friends birthday party, outings, and even on dates. It's  a great place to go to. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a great mexican feel...</text><Rating>4<//Rating></record>

The food is great and reasonably priced. Servers for the most part are nice and friendly but can ignore you for extended periods of time.<//Review>

Portions are more than enough. Most recently, I have been the Sunday Brunch, $17.95/person with your choice of champagne, mimosas, or margaritas. Regarding drinks, you can't change it up mid-meal. So if you ordered a mimosa, you had to have refills of mimosa. Our party ordered the mimosas. The drinks started off nicely, evenly balanced. But each time we were given a refill, our drinks tasted more and more like straight oj. I was not blown away with most of the food offered at the brunch, sadly. The only things I recommend from the Sunday Brunch would be the Shrimp a la Diabla, handmade tortillas, omelets, and the dessert bar. I heard the menudo is delicious, but I'm not a big fan of squid or octopus. The live mariachi band that came around to every area was good.I enjoyed that.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The hostess wasn't all that friendly or nice, they sat us in the buffet room,which has alot of people walking in and out. Terrible service, nobody was really watching our table. Food was passable, although the waffles were horrible. The chile verde on the buffet was the best</Text>

<Text>they were rude and inconsiderate. first, they told me that the wait was 35 min, then after waiting for one hour I notice that they are sitting their friends before people who have been waiting. such a scam!
The patron silver margarita was way watered down!

If you do not make reservations wait time is about 40mins then another 30mins to be served and another 30 to get your food. In addition our waiter was so rude. Never coming here again not impressed at all. Would not recommend, first and last time here.< /Review>

Also had little gnats flying everywhere and into our drinks, my food was cold, and the busser wasnt in a good mood. Just overall a bad experience there. The one good thing was the bean dip and our waitress was nice.<//text>< Resp>

Homestyle Mexican food from a great, family-run restaurant.  The new phone boo..I mean Gigantic Menu Books may be hard for we senior citizens to navigate, or even to heft upward as we seek the familiar list of "Bulls":  a long-running set of excellent combination or specialty plates including pork medallions ("Alambres Mexicanos") and el ultimo mas fino, "Aaron's" the 9th Bull.  The margaritas are generous, the chips are fresh and salted, the salsa is excellent (ask for the rare picante batch) and the bean dip is a justified legend dampened only by serving containers far too parsimonious to meet the needs of Montano family customers who actually ask to sit in the "old section" because it reminds us of a time when the food was exactly as good, the service was exactly as friendly, there were horses hitched out back and the current owner was just a cute kid working for his dad.  This is great, old Los Angeles style Mexican food and there's no place better for a fun, relaxing, excellent meal.   Now, how do I convince Nick to allow me to bring my own bowl for the bean dip?</Review>

<Text>Come hungry because Los Toros portion sizes are very filling. Doesn't matter if you order food for breakfast, lunch or dinner... your going to get a lot of food on your plate! And speaking of filling, they have some awesome (free) bean dip *you can ask for vegetarian friendly bean dip fyi*( which is freakkkkking amazing!), salsa and chips to munch on while you wait for your food to arrive.

You have 3 places to choose from to sit which are: at the bar, on the patio or in a large section inside (fully covered room). They have a full bar and they have many Mexican types of beers on tap (I like Corona and Modelo the best!) Speaking of drinks their house margarita on the rocks is pretty bomb!I really liked the veggie burrito plate (Comes with Mexican rice and beans) and I loaded it up with their salsa. So good!

*Other important information: They have Sunday brunch from 10am to 3pm (Haven't been to it yet, but I heard about it from the bartender, when I asked about Happy Hour specials.) During the brunch you can do bottomless mimosas, which sounds veryyyyyyyy inviting in my book. Happy hour is from 3pm to 7pm, but not fully sure what days. But they seem to have daily specials of something everyday, even on the weekends. Parking is pretty awesome... FINALLY I find a parking lot that's decently sized for a large restaurant!

Off the 118 Freeway and not too far from the 101 Freeway if your looking for a place to steer away from the traffic madness and grab some grub and have a cold beer!<//Text>< pics>

Horrible took like 20 to be seated 20 min to get our drinks and 45 min to get our food . When we got our food it was horrible the carne asada fries had a hair the chipotle burger had no chipotle and came with nasty unseasoned fries. The shrimp cocktail had like 5 shrimps its was just horrible and hot in there . Won't ever go back and won't ever recommend</Review>

Grew up going here always been a favorite and of course the bean dip is the bomb, and so is the food of course. But the menu is like a damn magazine now. Wasn't so easy to find what you wanted to eat.<//text>

The drinks are okay and the fish tacos I had were terrible. I took two bites and didn't want anymore. There is free chips and bean dip, which I ended up having for lunch.

Maybe try something different on the menu.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Unfortunately, the customer service has been neglected, we ordered some tacos and some enchiladas with my husband ☹ and they brought us the tacos that they wanted to give us and my husband's enchiladas took them when they had finished my tacos, the cold food, there was never attention to the table the owner came to apologize just for getting out of trouble and the last waiter was attentive after I complained about the food ... sorry I had recommended the place and I liked it but they became very commercialized and I understand that They are full but if you go to a restaurant it is to enjoy the stay and the food, but tonight they disappointed me ...
A good restaurant is based on customer service, I hope they can improve it.

(Original)
Lastimosamente el servicio al Cliente lo han descuidado , ordenamos unos tacos y unas enchiladas con mi esposo ☹ y nos llevaron los tacos que ellos quisieron darnos y las enchiladas de mi esposo las llevaron cuando ya se habían terminado mis tacos , la comida fría , nunca hubo atención a la mesa el dueño llegó a disculparse solo por salir del paso y el mesero de último fue atento después que me queje de la comida ....lo siento habia recomendado el lugar y me gustaba pero se hicieron muy comercializados y yo entiendo que estén llenos pero si uno va a un restaurante es para disfrutar la estadía y la comida , pero esta noche me decepcionaron ...
Un buen Restaurante la base es el  servicio al cliente espero que lo puedan mejorar.</review>

(Translated by Google) I do not usually go to Mexican restaurants for the reason that I make Mexican food better, but today was that day that I decided to go to one to rest from not eating but again I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, this food that is called "Mexican food" is not haci at all. This place is for the gueros who clearly do not know about Mexican food but they do believe that they are eating it, what a sadness I can teach them to make a real rice to others that according to those shrimp enchiladas wow that is nothing ... the michelada does not taste like anything has more salt than serveza I will not return here.

Yo no acostumbro a ir a los restaurantes mexicanos por la razón que yo hago mejor la comida mexicana, pero hoy fue ese día que decidí ir a uno para descansar de no hacer de comer pero otra vez quedo con un mal sabor de boca, esta comida que se le llama “comida mexicana”no es para nada haci. Este lugar es para los gueros que claramente no saben de comida mexicana pero ellos si creen que están comiendo la, que tristeza yo les puedo enseñar hacer un arroz de verdad a demás que según esas enchiladas de camarón wow eso no es nada.... la michelada no sabe a nada tiene más sal que serveza no regreso aquí.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The place is nice and quite rustic, although the food for me was not the best, the prices somewhat high and I feel that the food is in the standard of something like: three brothers, the sources, the campfire, sauce & Beer, etc ... and you can find more accessible prices in similar restaurants, I ordered rice with shrimp and it was more vegetables 😏 and my very simple piña colada did not even have the cherry that is common in this drink ...
