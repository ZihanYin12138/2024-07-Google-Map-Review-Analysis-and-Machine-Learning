My stylist did exactly what I wanted and was also pleasant to chat with. I've been a regular at another chain for years but will most likely switch now because of the quality of this store's service.

Check-in online was quick and painless, no registration required. Wait time was 19 minutes from check-in to sit-down.<//text>< Pictures>

Yes,  the stylist change a lot(only meaning that if I have a favorite, not sure  how to keep thay one person) but either way my family(children and I)  always look and feel like a million dollars when we leave.

<text>The hair cut was awful she butchered me. If your a woman with short hair -DO NOT GO THERE they cut it like a mans. Its a shame because I have gone to other great clips and have been happy. There was no shaping, layering to my hair. It will take months for it to look half way decent. Tempted to go get some hair extensions until it grows out.<//text>< date>

<review>Not accepting of family with special needs. Not in my experience.

The hair cut is okay for the price. Overall, all hair clips I have been to with my son have not been so accepting to children with autism.

Update 8/19/18: zero stars if possible. We checked in using their app and I put 3 people getting hair cuts. Came in and finished up their check in. The lady who came in said we still had 30 minute wait and if we wanted to "run an errand" we could. We did. We came back and I notice my name and my son's name was on their check in, but not my husbands. So I ask kindly and rudely Ariana reply "yeah he's not on here" I told her  my name is #4 and my son's name is #6. Again rudly she said "yeah there's nothing I can do, he'll have to got to the bottom and it's a hour wait". Anyone with a child of Autism knows there's a time frame for everything. I asked her for he manager name and she laughed. Ariana at Atwater you're a horrible employee. If you think people are not going to be rude back to you, you're wrong. Never again will my family attend here. Not a good bussines ethic and not special needs friendly.< /review><user_id>105097744975388129873< /user_id><date>1534813294411<//date><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

My sons fade is always jacked up. I try to have a different girl cut it everytime hoping to find 1 good stylist, but no. Customer service is non existent. All they do is gossip. (Julie) No one cares about your drama and weight loss. They walk around looking miserable draging theyre feet, like they hate they're job. Saying, "Oh god." When a family walks in. Mumbling things to eachother. I wont be going here ever again.👎👎👎<//review><Resp>{'time': 1496847283125, 'text': "We're sorry to read this, Megan.

<Review>If you have children or teens, STAY AWAY from Allison! Not only does she not listen to them, she's rude about it too. Haircut was asked for, she choose differently, uneven sideburns, nape of neck, etc. Will not be going back there again.<//Review><user_id>101244210914451751927<//user_id>< resp>

< Review>
My wife got a Groupon deal for this place and it did not disappoint. This place is mainly a brewery/distillery it seems. I had and IPA and it was really tasty. They have an extensive menu of both beers/stouts as well as alcoholic pop they call Hard Frescoes. I did not sample the booze soda but one can just pop in and buy four packs of a large selection of the liquid menu items in tallboy cans. There is also food available with a largely south of the border feel. We shared a plate of tacos and some nachos which were super delicious. There was some sort of World/techno music playing which did not offend me. Big screen TVs to zone out on sports. The location is a bit out there, but it is easily accessible from the N-Judah. Because it is deep in the Sunset, street parking is probably pretty chill. I highly recommend this establishment and plan on going back for a night out very soon!<//Review>

This is one of the best new places in the Outer Sunset! I am impressed with the food and though I am not much of a drinker, I know that I would have been impressed with the Artisan whiskeys and local Brews when I used to drink all the time. the atmosphere is super chill and I highly recommend Taco Thursday. I don't think there's Ada parking but since it's a fairly high traffic area cars come and go all the time, if you need a close parking space. it used to be the Lawton Tap House and now it is seven stills. Cheers, mate!<//Review>

Seven Stills is a gem! Friendly and efficient. Jimmy, the chef, creates beautiful and extremely delectable plates. Take a look at the accompanying photo of the Breakfast Tostada. It does taste as amazing as it looks.
Outstanding!< /Text>

Low-key bar in the Outer Sunset. Good selection of local beers and hard frescos. We got a 'flight' of 5oz pours of all 4 hard frescos for $2 each and loved being able to try them all. Such a relaxing afternoon outing on the N-Judah (we also stopped for coffee, lunch, and a stroll on the beach.... :)</Text>

< Review>
Interesting craft brews - I’d recommend checking out website beforehand. We haven’t tried everything but only found one we’re super in love with - chocasmoke. Didn’t try the food but seems to be typical bar fare. Very family friendly and the decor seems to represent that a bit. Overall good vibes and friendly staff.<//Review>

<review>This spot is right by my daughter's school.  It has great & unique beers.  Staff is nice with explaining the varieties.  Haven't tried the food yet, but haven't been disappointed yet by any beers.  All the millennials and the TV screen looping skateboarders do make me feel a bit old and not quite hip enough.</review>< Pics>

Over charged. I had 3 daughters getting full sets 1 was told she couldnt get an hombre effect and just pick a color another asked for a very light color they grabbed a bright color then when I said it was the wrong one they called her a liar. And they cut them super short but charged extra for the length?<//Review>

Change from 5 stars to 1 star. This place has been my favorite nail place for years, but not anymore. I had gotten white ombre full set a week ago. This time it was done very differently then how they normally do it. The woman who did my nails did them as a "dip" I'd figure she knew what she was doing. When she was finish had asked her "doesn't my nails need to go under the UV lighting?" She said "no, they are done." I thought it was very odd.  But since I was leaving for vacation the next day for a week I didn't think nothing of it. The next day driving up north...I'd notice my nails looked yellowish ombre instead of a white ombre. My thumbs look like yellow teeth then what I had asked for. I'd just got back from vacation last night and called them today to see if they an fix  them. I am walking around with yellow teeth on my nails...its soo ugly and embarrassing. They told me they canNOT fix my nails because it was past 3 days. So I have to pay for another set ($50). Sorry I wasn't local I was in northern California and I didn't know the 3 day rule. So upsetting that they didn't even want to accommodate at all to fix their mistake. I am not asking for anything for free but not for full price ($50) either. Insane. I am always bringing other customers with me in who love this place. I also bring my 2 daughters with me too who get full service. Not cheap. Just make sure you guys don't get the dip white ombre full set because they will look like this...</Text>

Oh my gosh! I had a pedicure done there and the 1st time ever I had what looked like a cheese grater used on my feet for calluses. 2 days later I couldn't walk I have open sores on my toes and on my heels. I never told them about it. Didn't really think they would care maybe I should.<//review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Date>1564007375756< /Date><text>May gave me the best set of nails I've had in a very long time. She made sure each nail was smooth and did a very good job. I'll definitely be going back! Even though they up charged me and used gel with out asking.

*EDIT* I will NOT go back. My nails were done not even a week and they were all ready lifting and half off, 1 popped off while putting towels away, towels...

When i went to have them fix them, which I had an appointment  for, and willing to pay for them to fix it, they blew me off, and also wanted me wait 30 min well past my appointment.  Treated me like I wanted something free and was lying.

Not impressed at all!!! Save your money.<//text><rating>1< /rating><user_id>113573647996849505642< /user_id><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMx6eqk-QNY8JP5E3xzaWP5B5achL8jRRv8rdb-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Name>

< review>
Took my niece here as she asked if I knew any good nail places. The staff was wonderful. We called and asked if they had any openings and scheduled for the day of. Came in, got the color book and swatches to see what color she wanted and they immediately got to work for her. Also this place is Huge! Took maybe about an hour to get everything done. She really wanted to get the shape done right. Only $40 cash for the entire set. We made to sure to ask before anything as well. Super helpful!<//review>

I always worry when a place HAS room but I was desperate. The ladies were great. Hair is done in a seperate room from nails. My lady was very friendly and great with my corse, curly hair. I was in and out. My hair style lasted a week, it looked amazing, and it was less than when I went to supercuts! Thank you!!</Text>< date>

< review>
My nails are thick, lumpy and unproprtioned. I was in a hurry and didn't pay too much attention. I tipped said thank you. I hope to stop by this evening and see if they will redo them and update this review.
I gave them another 2 stars, just for customer service,  Kelly was great on the phone and offered to redo my nails. I truly hope that the results are amazing!
Kelly re did my nail, she was great! I am giving them another star.
I don't know if I would use anyone else (I tried another girl when Kelly was off) but I'm happy. Kelly knows what I want my nails to look like and I'll keep going.</review>

First time there a week ago. I will never go back!
Got gel fills (nails only). They are bubbly, lifting & every single nail is shaped differently.
I asked for square round, they are so oddly shaped. I don’t understand how an establishment can run a business & not understand what one wants. They made me pay up front ( I know, I should have ran) otherwise I would have walked out w/out paying & tipping her.They said they understood what I wanted and they just did what they wanted.
I will make ny 45 min to an hour drive & stick
With whom I’ve been going to for over 15 yrs..<//Text>

<review>Got a full set of glammed out stilettos by Lynh and not only are they PERFECT, but I broke one the next day and went in to get it fixed. Thank God Lynh was there again and she fixed it for me and touched up the rest for NO charge. I will ABSOLUTELY be returning to and recommending them. You ROCK, Lynh!< /review>< userid>

Maybe if they would fix your Nails (that they did poorly) with a good attitude & not make you feel uncomfortable, I would still be a customer. Maybe.</review>

That being said, my biggest issue was that while adjustments worked in the short term, there weren't many chiropractors that helped me try to correct the underlying issues. On my first visit, Dr. Mike walked through a series of tests and explained the problems that he was seeing. He immediately identified multiple complications that took some of my past chiropractors several visits to uncover. In addition to working on adjusting my alignment, he spent about half an hour with me going through multiple strengthening exercises to target the muscle groups that were unbalanced. So far, my experience with The Lab has been awesome. I am looking forward to continuing my treatment and hopefully, I will see some big changes soon.

Your best option in Los Angeles. Professional, friendly staff and knowledgeable doctors. I started with physiotherapy after knee surgery and was able to avoid surgery in my other knee due to the excellent treatment. Physiotherapy can be very boring and challenging but the staff of the LAB make it much easier. Highly recommended.</text>

I was treated by Dr. Mike @ The Lab for 10 months and I would HIGHLY recommend going to The Lab for your physical therapy. Thanks to everyone at The Lab, by back issues that I initially went in for have been remedied, my posture is the best it's ever been, and I now know how to user proper form during my regular workouts. The entire staff is excellent and highly trained. Plus everyone is super friendly! You won't regret going there.<//Text>

<review>Long story short I fractured my left shoulder snowboarding back in January. After I got surgery I had to start physical therapy immediately, so I found The Lab and I don't think I couldn't have picked a better place.  The facility is clean and bright and the staff is professional and supportive.  I've been working with Dr. Mike for over 4 weeks and he is an incredible physical therapist.  He is patient, knowledgeable, and personable and with his help I know I'll get back to 100%< /review>< username>

<review>I’ve had two injuries. One was a spinal disc injury which required surgery, and my current torn meniscus in my knee. I went to another PT prior that wasn’t helping me heal or giving me proper exercise to speed my recovery. That is a whole different story at LAB. Great Drs of PT and really take the time to help your body move through the healing process. I have felt stronger and gained back movement each visit. Everyone really makes an effort to make sure you won’t RE-injure yourself during exercises and help swelling and your muscles relax. I will not go anywhere else for PT.</review>< Pictures>

HE BEST physical therapy place in all of LA and I have been to quite a few. Dr. Mike is amazing and has always been incredibly knowledgeable and helpful in helping me recover and get back to where I need to be for my physical activity. The hands-on work that the doctors do here surpasses all other places I've been to. Dr. Mike works skillfully with his hands like an elegant surgeon navigating his way through your muscular skeleton system with great precision. The building is always clean and the staff is always friendly. It's also a lot easier to take advice from the doctors when you know they practice healthy habits themselves. They live what they teach. An also added bonus that they are incredibly kind and funny as well. The environment is the cream of the crop. The best in the biz. First place gold medal. In all seriousness though, come here if you want your injuries fixed. Other places have just never lived up to here. Highly recommend.</Text>

I’m not generally the type of person to write a review unless it warrants one and for LAB physical therapy, I definitely have to share my experience as they totally deserve a 5 star review across the board. I have never been so pleased with my experience as the doctors Mike and John are so caring and definitely have a wealth of knowledge/experience and truly want you to get better. They are so helpful and kind and take the time to not only work with you but to educate you as well. It was also satisfying because both are actual doctors DPT working on you and spend one on one time as opposed to throwing you off to an island. Emily the assistant is super awesome and works step by step with you during your exercises.

Overall, great staff, extremely clean/organized, and definitely the best physical therapists.<//text>

The best PT doctors ever. I’ve been to several places before coming to the LAB. Since 2017, I have very severe my neck disc/right side sciatica. Those symptoms caused by multiple injuries and factors in many years. From 2017, I went to 3 different physical therapy and I had to switched my docs several times to figure it out. (As you know, some docs are not really docs... due to my insurances, due to mistreatment from the previous docs, my symptoms are not really getting better.. it was more of getting worse)

I finally found a decent sports medicine doc in 2020. And I’ve found the LAB docs in Jan 2021.  Now I obviously know who’s good or who’s bad quite well. (For example, my previous PT places didn’t conduct manual therapy at all. A lot of physical aids only assisted me for 10 months so that I couldn’t get better much. Even the PT doc actually recommended me to go get an injection or consider a surgery haha....)

But, now, it’s been only 6 weeks since I started going to the LAB, my pain level is incredibly reduced. My right arm is quite smoothly moving and am able to work many hours without having severe stiffness. They conduct the right physical exercise step by step and the doctors do the manual therapy very thoroughly. Dr.Choe is the person who’s been treating me with his team. They are top notch.< /review>

Life is extra tough right now with Covid and such. So having a compound leg fracture to rehab back to “pro athlete” status is no joke. Staff and place is great. So much that I came back here. 4 years ago had a very serious injury and the Lab helped me get back to competing. A few weeks into rehab I already know and feel, mentally and physically ready for what’s coming! Thank YOU guys so so much. Mike and John and the rest of the staff get 5 stars!</review>

<review>I’ve been a patient at the LAB for about 3 years now. Both Dr. Mike and Dr. John are extremely attentive and have extensive knowledge of what ails the body and how to alleviate pain through muscular therapy as well as the right, targeted exercises to improve mobility and increase strength. I first came to Dr. Mike after I sprained my ankle (again) after a soccer injury. He got me back on my feet so quickly! Since then I’ve seen him for my sciatica and recurrent neck, shoulder, and back pain.

The facilities are clean and right in the heart of downtown. Super convenient back with I worked around the corner. Now in the pandemic, i still see Dr. Mike each week to continue to soothe muscle aches and build strength in the right muscle areas to reduce pain in the future! The staff keeps the facility very clean and sanitized and everyone is wearing a mask at all times, with strict appointment times now to limit the number of people in the facility at one time.

Beyond that the equipment is best in class and I always leave the LAB feeling better then when I walk in! Thanks for all your help over the years!</review></record></dataset><record>

Great staff who works with your busy schedule. Physio will have some discomfort but you're in capable hands with these people.

The location and equipment feels very modern and cutting age so you're to be sure to get the latest and greatest treatment options with them.

I go in during my lunch hour and usually get out before then.< /Review>

Normally, I don't write reviews about businesses, but I believe that the LAB Doctors truly deserve more recognition. Having done PT before, I thought I knew what to expect when I began to work with Dr. Mike and Dr. John.  However, their level of patient care is so beyond my expectations that I can't believe I had never heard of The LAB before. These doctors will truly provide you with premium care and will make PT fun.

When I had done PT the first time, I didn't enjoy going to PT and skipped sessions occasionally because a.) it hurt, and b.) it was incredibly boring. I met the physical therapist twice over the course of 6 months and did the exercises alone with zero supervision.

At the LAB, however, I get excited about every session and would never even think about canceling for the day. The doctors are incredibly welcoming and friendly, and unlike the place I had done PT at before, Dr. Mike and Dr. John will always walk you through the exercises to make sure that you are practicing good form and that your time is being spent well.

If you are looking for a physical therapist in the Los Angeles Area, I would highly recommend giving the LAB a call. You truly won't regret it.</Text>

Doctors Mike and John have a keen eye for sports related injuries and they've been able to get me in and out, feeling like new within a few sessions. I went in with a shoulder injury, and they diagnosed an imbalance I didn't even realize I had. The place is very professional, but without being too formal. You can joke with both the doctors and the interns, and everyone is really friendly, but they're all ready to answer your questions with professionalism, and accuracy. This place doesn't have fancy machines, but that's what's so great about it. They break your injuries down to the basics and build your strength from the ground up. If you're looking for a place that will treat your injuries and rehabilitate your physical imbalances, look no further.</text>< userid>

I came to The Lab Doctors after a disc herniation in my back. I had been having PT for almost six weeks elsewhere and had seen no improvement in my symptoms. I was dealing with severe nerve pain in my leg with tingling and numbness. My ability to function in my daily life had been dramatically affected and I was miserable.

Thankfully, I found Dr. Choe and I am now feel I am on the road to recovery. From my very first visit, I felt like I was in the hands of professionals. Dr. Choe and his team are kind and caring, as well as informative and knowledgable. Within weeks I started to see improvements in my pain and mobility.

I am someone who always has questions and Dr. Choe is always ready to answer my concerns and queries. He also listens when I tell him how my body is feeling and he makes adjustments to treatment when needed. The staff are super friendly and make the mundane experience of physical therapy much more bearable. The location in downtown LA is also bright and airy and a pleasant place to receive treatment. I would definitely recommend The Lab Doctors.</review>

After a lifetime of contact sports and 3 shoulder surgeries, I'm no stranger to physical therapy.  Dr Mike is far and away the most knowledgeable and talented P.T. I've ever seen.  I delayed therapy after my latest surgery, and was afraid I wouldn't get anywhere near 100%.  I'm a few months out from my last session and still haven't had a single issue with the shoulder.  I've even recently started BJJ in my late 30's, which is more than I thought I could hope for.  My thanks to Dr Mike and the staff for turning back the clock on my beat up old body.</Text>

<Review>I've been to dozens of Physical Therapy places over the decades and this one is the best. I have old injuries from Football and Track and flare up in my hips and back. Mike and the crew know what they're doing and working with them has significantly reduced pain in my lower back day to day. The facility is clean with a great view. Their COVID protocol is solid as well.</Review><UserId.>102309447132984701635</UserId.>< Rating>

I felt like nobody would figure out what’s wrong with me, I even saw 5 different sports medicine doctors and they all misdiagnosed me.In under 15 minutes this man figured out what I’ve been trying to find out for 18 months by doing physical tests. Most professional therapist I’ve ever encountered, he even answers his emails so quick to respond with very helpful feedback cause he knows I live 2 hours away. He’s also rated one of the best physical therapists in Los Angeles, so that should speak volumes on its own. If you need physical therapy then you need to meet Dr.John!< /text>< Name>

Highly recommend the LAB Doctors.  Professional, knowledgable, and clean. They place a lot of import on continuing education, both in terms of keeping up with current research and using evidence based practice. Dr. John always makes sure to explain what's going on and why. I've never had an instance where I've asked a follow-up question and not had it satisfactorily answered in depth.  These guys are Top Notch!<//review>

I moved to LA mid-last year but had my ACL repaired just a few months prior. On top of that, I was nursing lower back pain and wasn't doing myself any favors moving boxes and building furniture. Fast forward a few weeks, some prescription medication and an MRI later, and I found myself at The Lab meeting Dr. Mike for my initial evaluation. Fast forward some more and I've now been a patient for several months and have seen more relief than I could have imagined. From advising me on exercises to strengthen target areas to correcting some bad habits in order to mitigate further injury, Dr. Mike has helped me navigate the road to recovery. He, along with the entire staff, treats patients with the utmost care and professionalism while also investing the time to get to know them at a personal level. At the end of the day, I consider seeking treatment by Dr. Mike at The Lab as the single decision I made in not only treating my pain, but learning how to prevent it going forward.<//Review></record>

The treatment I’ve received from him has been great. He was able to quickly assess where the issues were and how to correct them. The exercises he gave me strengthened my legs and glutes and mostly eliminated the pain in those problem areas. His regimen WORKS.

I especially like that Dr. Mike explains what is happening to the muscles and your body as he evaluates you. I’ve recommended several friends here, and I would recommend anyone to Dr. Mike or Dr. John.</Review>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>My wife has been going here for about a year and had been repeatedly asking me that I go see Dr. Mike for my rounded shoulder because he has been fanatastic in helping her deal with soreness and pain from bad posture. I finally decided to listen to my wife this month because it was our last week in LA before moving out of state and I figured I had nothing to lose trying it out for 1 week. After the first session with Dr. Mike, I immediately wished that I had listened to my wife earlier in seeing Dr. Mike. He quickly identified problems with my posture and weak areas of my body. To address my issues, he designed excercises to strengthen my weak parts of the body as well as doing treatment. I went there daily for a week (excluding weekends) before I had to move away, but I could feel that my posture has  slightly improved and my weaker muscles have gained some strengths. I just wish I had more time with them.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Dr. John is fantastic. Where other physicians were puzzled regarding foot pain I was having that was affecting my work and mobility, he spotted the cause immediately and got me on a course of exercises and treatment that have done wonders. Now, I'm not even remotely a gym person, and the prospect of physical therapy felt a little intimidating to me. My concerns disappeared immediately: the staff is welcoming, professional, and great to work with. If you're in need of physical therapy, I can't recommend this place enough!</Text>< resp>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I cannot say enough good things about the team over at The LAB. The staff, the location, the vibe. Everything is encouraging, calming and sensational.

I've had a lower back issue that's been affecting my day-to-day for 6+ months, and before LAB I tried other places with some success, but the pain returned after a few weeks. I had a severe flare up a month ago and looked up The LAB and immediately had hopes this would be the last stop to fix my issues. After reading a few reviews, with others needing 8-10 sessions to get back on track, I was concerned I'd need way more sessions. I was wrong. After the first session, Dr Mike got me feeling way better than previous first sessions at other places. He was excellent: diagnosed my problems immediately and set me on the perfect road to get me way stronger than normal. I only needed a total of 4 sessions to get back to 95%. And it wasn't just the sessions that steered me in the right direction, Dr Mike and his staff gave me the instruction I needed to help me continue the workouts at home in between sessions too. I'm confident that I won't be going back to my old painful ways, but if I do, the team at The LAB taught me what I need to know to get back to full strength. Tremendous thanks to everyone!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7b40ef1f641:0x99f4716dec14bacd<//GmapID></record>

This is a super long overdue review that I should've done earlier since I have been recommending The Lab to all my coworkers (For those of you who work in the DTLA financial district, you MUST check them out)!! I have been going to The Lab since April 2018 after hurting my neck and shoulder from doing at-home workout video without any supervision. Back then I lived on the west side and commuting to DTLA, and I couldn't afford to take a few hours out of my long commute day to go to the UCLA one, which I have been do before. So I decided to start looking for other options in DTLA and luckily I found The Lab.

After a few sessions, the neck and shoulder pain got better, but I wanted to keep going and get stronger to prevent any future injuries. While I jumped around in many different types of workouts (e.g. at-home training videos, gym setting, jogging, hot yoga, pilates, etc.), Dr. Mike answered not only my questions, but also went through certain exercises together even if it's not part of the exercise routine that he made for me (and even including yoga poses!!).

Even if I exercised to prevent any future injuries, I knew sitting down all day long and working 60-70+ hours a week would break my body down sooner or later. At The Lab, a session is structured as a combination of treatment and workout. There were many sessions where I could only get the treatment because either I worked past midnight the night before or I have to get back to work. Thanks to those treatment, I was able to survive through busy season at work!!

I really wish Dr. Mike and Dr. John open up another office here in Minneapolis!! My experience with The Lab was awesome and not sure if I can be satisfied with anywhere else (fingers crossed).<//text>

The LAB is a top notch office. Dr. John has taken a really tough situation (my ignored injury) and helped me heal in a short amount of time. I thought I was going to need surgery, but with Dr. John's care, my ankle has strengthened significantly and it looks like I will not need surgery after all. Dr. John has a skill set that is unbeatable. He pushes you to work towards your recovery and his staff is professional and kind. My favorite part at the LAB is when he works on my injury at the table with massage, ultrasound and heat/ice pack to finish. Most physical therapy offices I've been to do not give you this personal care/attention which is one of the most important parts of the healing process! I highly recommend the LAB. The office is clean, modern & has killer DTLA views. The equipment is new & reflects today's standard. I am so thankful to have met such a wonderful team. They have changed my life for the better!</Text>

These guys already have many stellar reviews so I feel like I don't have much value to add, but I've received such amazing care over the last 8 weeks that I feel I need to. I've had chronic back pain for the last 3.5 years and had horrible experiences with PT before so I was hesitant to try these guys. But after a coworker's recommendation and looking at all of their positive reviews on Google/Yelp, I thought I'd give them a shot. And I am SO GLAD that I did! They worked miracles with my insurance so I didn't have to pay anything out of pocket. (That alone should tell you how great these guys are!) During the first visit,  Dr. John did a consultation where he got to know my injury and medical history. Then he designed some exercises for me to do to strengthen my lower back. Every visit, I'd do the exercises with some of his staff (who are all AMAZING by the way) and then Dr. John himself would stretch me out and put me on a muscle stim device. Doing that for 6-8 weeks has helped me go from taking pain medication every day to taking them once or twice a week. Thanks to the Lab Drs, I feel so much more aware of and in control of my pain. They have 100% changed my life and I cannot thank them enough. I HIGHLY recommend them for anyone who needs PT!<//text>

<Resp>None</Resp><Name>William Wright<//Name><text>I recently had ACL reconstruction and cartilage repair, followed by 11 weeks on crutches. I've been going to The Lab for about 2 months now and Dr. Mike has helped me make great progress and actually has me ahead of where I expected to be in my recovery! Dr. Mike has been great in identifying any minor issues I have had along the way and quickly suggests ways to help. The exercises I've been given for my knee are varied and challenge me the perfect amount, and these are followed-up by manual work and electrotherapy when I'm in for my PT sessions.

The space is bright, clean and spacious, and the downtown location is great. Both Dr. Mike and Dr. John are super knowledgable, friendly and take a vested interest in your recovery. I'd highly recommend The Lab to anyone!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The facility reminded me of a hybrid of a cross-fit gym and an open-space therapy room. The place is spacious with a modern touch. Real suave.

I visited Dr. Mike Choe, DPT, to receive consultation and treatment for pain management. He personally took the time to listen to my discomfort, provided hands-on stretching to find the source of the pain, and consulted different exercise routines to mitigate tensions on my lower back. He also provided me with running tips by recording my (running) form. Turned out my center of gravity is quite low. He is very knowledgable in his profession and truly enjoys helping people.

What separates Dr. Mike from other PTs is that he really cares for his patients. He followed up with a text to check up on my condition. How awesome is that!? He really went above and beyond.< /review><user>113796510592611181938</user><Resp>{'time': 1474163063747, 'text': 'Thank you Paul!

< Review>
I injured my ACL and was worried that I would need a surgery.
Thanks to John and his team I was able to recover without the need of a surgery.
I started playing football again!
Thanks John, I'll be waiting for you back here in Argentina!

Tucked away off Broadway in Chinatown. A small menu but plenty of tasty choices. I had an egg salad sandwich, it was delightful. I also ordered chizu curry fries, so good. I'll be back for their chicken sandwiches.<//Text>< Pictures>

One of the best sandwiches i’ve ever had. I got the honey walnut shrimp sandwich and it was amazing. Unfortunately, I devoured it before I could get a picture. You should also try the onigiri and fruit sando.</Text>

< Review>
Honestly the best Sando place I been to in a hot minute. This shop is discreetly hidden on a busy street in LA's Chinatown. I can't believe I've walked by it without noticing it before. The chicken was huge like it was bigger than the bread. The sauce, pickles, bulgogi onigiri and egg salad were to die for. Definitely coming back again.<//Review>

<review>Can be easily missed if not looking closely.  Ordered honey walnut shrimp.  At first glance i thought it might be underwhelming - but after first bite i was taken aback.  Quality toast and shrimp in every bite.  A sandwich alone was filling which says a great deal, i regret not ordering the pickles of the day as they would likely have added to the sandwich.  Worth trying.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I thought the sandwiches were going to be small but they were hefty sandos!  I had the chicken and it was divine.   Splurge and get the curry fries!  So tasty.  Couldn’t finish everything but I have leftovers for later.  The staff was very kind too!</text>

Interesting concept and menu, but I probably won’t be back. The honey walnut shrimp sandwich was lacking, but the curry chicken Katsu was yummy as well as the fries.< /Review>

Amazing Japanese sandwiches on perfectly baked milk bread and also convenient store-style treats! Had the pork sando and the honey walnut shrimp, both were super fresh and tasty! Don't sleep on the onagiri either, had the pork kimchi one and it was so good!<//Review>

Honestly YES. This is the sando place we didn't ask for but always needed! Love the shrimp walnut sando IMO you don't need to add anything to it and I love that you get a crunchy walnut in most bites. (The chicken sando is solid too)

You can't eat here and not order the curry fries! Also be warned there is something addicting in their spicy sauce. I typically can't finish this sandwich in one meal as the portions are huge. Love coming to this local gem!<//review>

Covid had me missing konbini fruit sandos super bad so when I found this place on Instagram, I ordered right away. Katsu curry exceeded my expectations as well. Pork and chicken were both juicy and crispy. If you are missing station curry and konbini staples, I recc. Katsu Sando to fill the void.<//text>

We loved it. The chicken Katsu was delicious. Great flavor and the chicken was moist and tender. Will definitely go back again!< /text>

(Translated by Google) Good portions and service although I didn't find the food very good.

There are no tables or somewhere nearby to eat, so orders are to go.

(Original)
Buenas porciones y servicio aunque la comida no me pareció muy buena.

No hay mesas o algún lugar cercano para comer, por lo que las órdenes son para llevar.</text>

Tried this place on a whim at the start of this year, and have been coming back almost every weekend since. Great staff and it's really nice to be able to experiment with different flavors. Would recommend the taro milk tea (or prince milk tea for something similar, but less sweet) with grass jelly.</text>

<review>Quickly is my all-time favorite boba place 😋.
Aside from favorite smoothies, they also have appetizers that you can get.

The staff are friendly😊
Thank you Quickly for making me a delicious avocado with mixed jellies and boba 😋😋🙌🙌🙌.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo6YkpO8hY83hDhlBdlr96joSLshI58268fCDL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

My favorite place to get Boba Tea. I would recommend the tiger snow and to eat a spam & egg bowl. The atmosphere is nice. During the daytime there's nice music playing, usually rap/hip hop. There are also card games and connect 4. Staff is friendly and usually helpful if you dont know what to order. I recommend trying the different toppings as well.< /text>

Young man (Q), he's very nice, it was a pleasure meeting him. My first time to visit and try this place and he surely made me a new fan. I only came in to try the avocado with boba, but I also ordered fried calamari, popcorn chicken and sweet honey bread. All were so delicious. (Q) suggested I try these popular food items and I'm very happy I did. The place is clean, nice atmosphere and they have chess games to play while waiting. I'm a happy fan of the place thanks to you (Q)!!!</review>

I had no idea what this place was when entering but stood amazed as soon as I walked through the door. There are SOOOO many drinks options from teas to snows to milks, and a small selection of food to boot. I was flabbergasted when my just mixed (delicious) Thai Tea with Honey Boba came with a just-sealed plastic film on top, perfect for poking a straw through. The staff were so friendly, patient and helpful when I explained I had no idea what to get. They let me taste things and made a great suggestion. I will be back!!!</text>

I asked for a regular sized milk tea with boba and paid a 10 in cash. I took the change without counting(because I have never had anyone miscount my change in years) and when I got in my car and took a sip I realized there was no boba and I had less than $5 in change, meaning I was somehow charged over $4 for a regular sized no boba drink. Didn't give 1 star because the kids seem nice and I didn't have issues the other time I was there.<//Text>

They have a nice variety of fabric.  They have many of the patterns they sell made up so you can see if you like it.  They have hardware and patterns for bags.  Always a pleasant experience.< /text>

<Review>Have gone in here several times while visiting PS. Great store with a wide range of fabrics, but the owner (I believe her name is Debby) is mean as a snake. She has responded with impatience and attitude a couple times when I asked a question, and I’ve overheard her speaking incredibly rude to her staff once— I’m talking stuff that only a heartless soul would say to another person. Was quite shocking and sad, really, to think about how pathetic her life must be to be speaking to someone like that. Obviously an extremely questionable character and not someone who deserves my business or yours (IMHO). Do not recommend. What a sad woman and a terrible thing to overhear. Can’t even type it here bc it was so vulgar and rude.< /Review>< user_name>

<text>Lots of interesting fabric and patterns. We have been there twice in two weeks.  The red-haired lady at the counter was pleasant and helpful. However,  the other lady (who appears to be the owner) was very snippy- neither friendly or helpful.  If I had to deal with her I probably wouldn't return.<//text>< Pics>

Customer service is great plus the fabric collection is always top notch. There are always beautiful displays and to add to the goodie list is the punch card when filled gives you a $20.00 credit on your next visit. My favorite quilt fabric shop in all of the Valley.<//text>

I had a five star experience. BUT, I saw a lovely Sr. Citizen ask to exchange a pattern that she accidentally bought twice shut down for an exchange. Mind you this person STILL bought far and beyond the exchange amount. Monica"s fabrics would NEVER do this to a customer! I will still shop quilters faire. But, I prefer to give my business to Monica"s. Honest service is what builds Americas small businesses.</Text>

I stopped into this delightful quilt store while driving through the area.  What a treat it was!  The ladies were as nice as could be and very helpful.  While browsing the store, I found some fabric I've been looking for to complete a project.  I don't travel a lot, but hope to be able to stop in again.<//Text>

The selection of fabrics was amazing, the staff just lovely and really helpful, and the prices were terrific. If, like me, you google quilt stores whenever you travel and you are in the Palm Springs area, this is a "don't miss" shop.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>In response to the review below, I find that very hard to believe.  I have never had a problem with anything at The Quilter's Faire.  There must have been another side to this issue that the poster was not privy too.  I return year after year to the Quilters Faire for all my fabric/quilting needs.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<text>Your store is beautiful, your layout is incredible and your help is awesome.  Every time I've come to your store with big or little projects you have helped me make my projects look fantastic instead of just a quit, table runner or pillow.  Thank you, thank you!

I can clearly hear the cook say (Is been over 20 minutes and this food is still here) The blonde lady server is super rude and talks to you like she doing you a favor by taking your order. If she is the manager I highly recommend changing management because with an attitude and service like that nobody would want to go eat there.< /Text>< pictures>

As a regular and weekly frequent eater of this brand chain eatery. I was HUGELY DISAPPOINTED AND REGRETFUL to have purchased my Valentine's snack from this location. I assure you 4 other locations i visit regularly Have NEVER served such a short supply. I expected the same quality and portions as any other location. My fries didn't even reach the top. Even With extra chicken added my fries they were bare, i had to speak with a manager and even then he argued the point with me before adding not so much as 5 pieces of chicken... if that. Buffalo Spot such a disappointment to me today.</Review>

Rude server kept telling me that applepay/Samsung pay doesn't work. So I asked if she could try to see if it works. Lo and behold it worked and then she continued to tell me that I was giving her attitude. Even tho she was wrong I was being told I was giving attitude. Such poor training.

The food was OK tho.</Text>

The atmosphere was fine but smelled like cigarettes the whole time with people smoking right outside the tent. They also were NOT checking temperature. The beer was boring with lack of variety and basically only domestic pale ales/lagers. We didn’t try the chicken but the food was expensive for it being pretty bland and took a long time to get to us.

On the plus side, we liked the large portions that gave us the shareable bar food feel.  The server was very attentive and seemed like a good guy but we won’t be going back and wouldn’t recommend to friends.<//Review>

I tried the spicy chicken wings and I must say I was disappointed. It didn't have the kick that most other spicy wings bring. Outside was okay but inside was too bland.<//Review>

We came here three times to attend different family events. It’s a nice place to arrange any kind of family or social event. Their overall service is good, the staff is well-mannered and cooperative.</review>< Pics>

I love this place! They prepare splendid dishes, they have a nice menu, The chef in that spot is a real pro, I like a lot trying all their food. The dishes are always fresh, the attitude towards the guests  is nice. I often go to  this restaurant and I was never unhappy. I recommend it with no hesitation.<//review>

Cute and intimate neighborhood spot in Sizzler . Seating was kind of squashed for four people, so I would recommend you come with a smaller party.

We ordered a ton of things to try, including oysters, calamari, shrimp corn fritters, etc. Everything was solid with maybe the exception of the corn fritters which were bland.

The lobster was served cold weird red seasoning. I told waiter and received another lobster was cooked however had no flavor and had the same weird red seasoning on top. I think they put the lobster in microwave because he brought to my table too fast. I spent lot here with sad results. I asked the cashier if there lobster was same as red lobster  think he just said yes to get a customer.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This is a semi casual establishment. Serving everything from stake to Lobster, the Malibu chicken is to die for. All in all Sizzler is a classic, All American, California destination. Would highly recommend the salad bar.<//Text>

<review>We have been coming here for a while and basically get the same “Senior” lunch this time we added the salad bar for an extra cost. I ate my fill at the salad bar and requested a box for my “senior”lunch. The waitress was rude and condescending towards me and accused me of “cheating”. I paid for my meal in good faith. I was simply full and proceeded to let her know. She scolded me as a child who did not understand the restaurant policy and said I needed to “eat” my lunch instead of choosing to take my lunch home. What??? Needless to say we won’t be back ... if this is how Seniors are being treated ... no thank you!</review><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>3</Rate>< date>

Actually this place is pretty good as far as the salad service goes. All-you-can-eat salad bar and that's all I had was just a salad and fruit. It was great , my grandson had a coupon from school for a burger and fries Burger King with absolutely nothing on it no mustard no ketchup no pickles no nothing just the Patty and buns I went over to the salad section because he has 4 thousand islands Dressing put that on his burger and he gobbled it up. They gave me fresh garlic bread nice and hot he and I ate bad pink lemonade was pretty good. Service is great. Found out that they also do their own Indian cuisine for customers that request large groups</Review>

Very GOOD SERVICE, I have not been served with this type of Love since my mother was alive. Our waiter was not only taking care of the salad bar, but was taking care of atleast four (4) tables within my hearing.

I took my daughter there Friday.  Both ordered salad bar/ buffet.  Salad was wilted and all vegetables at room temperature.    The "taco bar" was despicable.  The carnitas were sitting in a pool of oil.  The "seasoned taco meat"  was mush.  It looked like dog food.  The cheese sauce was obviously from a can and lukewarm.    Spent the next day with multiple unpleasant trips to the restroom.  Avoid!< /Text>< pictures>

Okay so this is a review I am excited to write about as silly as that may seem lol. I came with my best friend and mom after church for the salad bar because I have picky eating habits and Sizzlers has the best salad bar and bread lol I was so happy to learn they serve brunch on Sundays from opening to 2pm. There was a pleasant gentleman running an omelette bar and waffle bar ! They were included in the salad bar at no extra cost though the gentleman does except tips which I more then was happy to tip because he was so nice and made amazing personal omelettes, enough toppings for the omelette you will have a great meal!! That brunch was amazing and I had a great time, the staff was amazing as well. Highly recommend going for brunch on Sundays !< /text>

<Text>We thought we'd try a different Sizzler location!  Huge mistake!  We arrived about 4:30.  First thing we noticed was higher prices!  No guacamole on the salad bar, the sunflower seeds were VERY stale,  the iceberg lettuce was crisp but the mixed greens were few and very wilted!  The chicken wings were warm not hot, the pork on the taco bar was all dried out and appeared to have been setting for some time!  I got some from the bottom and it was still dried out!  The Diet Coke was very flat!  As we were leaving a girl was finally bringing fresh salad bar items but to my amazement she was just piling the new and fresh onto the old stuff!  I thought they were supposed to get rid of the old or at least put the older on top?  This was the Rialto Sizzler only!  We love Sizzler and have never had this experience at any other location!  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it was clean and the employees polite, the tomatoes fresh and good as was the Bleu Cheese Dressing!  But that was about it and we will NEVER go back to this location! I truly was afraid of getting sick from the food that had obviously been setting for some time!</Text>< pictures>

First of all there were Only 4 couple's in the restaurant so it wasnt busy. We had salad bar and entrees.Taco bar was dry ground beef and floating green peppers which i think was suppose to be pico de gallo And the Server was soo Rude..San Bernrdino Sizzler have nicer severs and Better Food.</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Horrible experience on 11/24/2018 @ 630pm. Our birthday dinner for 5 did not receive one of their entries. We did not notice until everyone else received their plates. We spoke to the cashier a out the missed entry and before he was able to say anything the acting manager Kamrul spoke for him and said he would fix this by a half charge on the entre, he then looked at our receipt and seen we had already had a coupon and told me that he would have to charge me full price since we already had a good discount.  What kind of unprofessional behavior is that? I then decided not to eat and requested his business card and he said he didn't have one? I found it hard to believe he was the manager and didn't have his business card at the restaurant he managed? I then asked him for his name and he said Kamrul. I asked him for his last name and he said Kamrul I asked what was his first name he said Kamrul. I asked for his managers name and he said Mustafa while laughing. I then reminded him of the birthday boy and girl in our party and he said tell your server. The server looked uncomfortable but maintained his professionalism throughout the entirety of the night. The server apologized multiple times as did the cashier but the manager just stood there with a grin on his face. I am never going back to this location again and urge others to find another location as well.<//Review>< pics>

<review>When you go to Sizzler, you expect it to be the same way every time. At least I do, for the simple fact that it's a franchise, and do not have their "own" dishes on the menu. Anyhoo, ibordered the 8 oz tri (something) steak cooked medium. When i got my steak, it was almost well, and grey in color. It literally looked like it was thrown on the grill for 2.2 seconds, just to get a "mark" on the steak. When i asked the Owner about how it was actually cooked, he insisted it was grilled. When I showed him my steak I was taking home, his exact words were "well, thats almost well done" I said.. That's my point! It's almost well, with barely a mark on it! If it was actually grilled, the meat would reflect that.. Again he insisted it was grilled, and I agreed to disagree, and walked out. I think moving forward, I will patronize a different location. Just a heads up people! If you like your steaks legit grilled - this is NOT the location for you! This was the corner of Riverside Ave and Baseline, in the city of Rialto.. Just an FYI.. Our waitress was wonderful! Very personable, very capeable, and so sweet! So thumbs up on the customer service!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

A great old classic, with the consistent items on the salad bar buffet, since 1985(with a few upgrades). The weekend brunch is the best. For $13.99, you get unlimited omelets, belgian waffles, hash browns, sausage, menudo, bacon, and all the regular buffet items. Plus you get unlimited orange juice included. Soft drinks and alcohol beverages are extra.< /text>

Slow and poor service. Food wasn't that great either. Also, why add an additional $4 fee for using a Groupon? Just because you felt like it?  "A promotional value" isn't that what you signed up for when you offered the Groupon deal? Bad business move. It shouldn't be at the customers cost for your loss. I will never recommend this place to anyone or be returning!< /text>

This is the poorest Sizzler presentation that I have been to..During the Sumner there is no air conditioning . The food is mediocre at best. Twice now I have had to return my steak as it was over cooked. Both times it came back raw. I will not return and  can not recomend this Sizzler< /review>
