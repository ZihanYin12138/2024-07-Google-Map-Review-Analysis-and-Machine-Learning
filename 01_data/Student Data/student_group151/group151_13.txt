< Review>
William and team are wonderful! I recently moved to the area and was in need of maintenance. Bay Area Motor Works came highly recommended by a colleague and I could not be happier. Scheduling an appointment was easy, communication with the shop was great, pricing was reasonable and the service was completed the same day. I will continue to service my vehicles with Bay Area Motor Works.< /Review>

I feel really lucky to have found William after years of servicing through a dealership. He knows his business and is clearly skilled. But he’s also just a decent human being and goes out of his way to help his clients. I also don’t have have to second guess recommendations - trust him completely<//Review>

<text>When I am looking for a new mechanic I make initial judgements based on the appearance of the business.  The lobby is always clean, organized and very well maintained.  The various mechanic's bays are immaculate with not only a clean and tidy environment, but state of the art equipment.  William is great to talk too and will go the extra mile to explain what the problem is and the proper course of action.  He pays attention to details and thoroughly researches the best quality parts for your vehicle.</text><Rate>5</Rate>< userid>

I have BMW x3 2004 year. I really like this service. All works were done within one day. They provide documents with price for approving after detecting issues. They provide detailed explanation what was done now and what should be done next maintenance.<//Text>

The whole process at BAMW is excellent.  From the service reservation, check in, inspection, estimate, to pickup, it was smooth and easy.  Also, the techs are highly skilled and personable.  They will answer all your questions in a straightforward manner.

Highly recommended!<//text>

Any time I use a new mechanic I check to see what is required and recommended. While MB prices tend to be high I appreciate that William the owner always tells which are needed and which can be left to future appointments. William explains in plain language what is best and my car is always done on time. I wholeheartedly recommend Bay Area Motor Works to my friends.<//Text>

<Text>I have been a customer for over 20 years. 14 years of maintenance on my 328,  5 years - 323, and 2 years - 335.  William is a high-end professional! Extreme attention to detail, expert knowledge of European cars, and outstanding customer service. He is the reason I kept older cars for a long time and it makes economical sense.
William, in many cases, advised against some unnecessary repairs, or helped to delay some non-critical ones. I saved a bunch.
The last, but not the least, the place is so clean you can eat of the floor :)< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1598897987298, 'text': 'Thank you for the thoughtful review, Paul!'}</response><gmap_id>0x808e351955555555:0x7b8a25ae288ea57b<//gmap_id></record>

I am a new customer of Bay Area Motor Works.  I didn't like paying the high prices at the dealership to have my VW Passat serviced.  I tried BAMW.  William is friendly, competent and follows through on his promises.
I am a customer for the long haul!

My friend and I have been using Bay Area Motor works since 2002 for all kinds of service and repair works, as well as, evaluation of the vehicles we  were buying, including brands such as BMW, Audi, Subaru and Toyota. Certainly, I can recommend this shop to a friend.< /Text>

They have diff labor charges per hour and imo way over priced. How do they determine what the labor process will be? The process was entirely too long also. They are not open sat. They are open some fridays. Business must be good but will not be returning. There are more German shops to choose from that have better labor rates.</Text>

These guys are awesome! They were really fast, very honest, very helpful and just all around respectful. I will continue to bring my BMW to them every time it needs a tune up or repairs! They worked with me on the price and I doubt I could've gotten a better $ anywhere else.<//Review>

My car overheated and blew a fuse while idling on the freeway, waiting for an accident to clear. I had the car towed to William's. He took charge of it immediately, fixed the problem, and had my car ready the next day. Working with William is always the best and easiest part of having to deal with car problems.</Text>

<review>William has serviced our cars for more than 10 years, totaling more than 200,000 miles between my wife's MZB and my BMW. The 1988 BMW has been driven more than 200,000 miles. It has been the expert care and attention William has provided to this 30 year old car that has made it fun and affordable to keep. Hands down, Bay Area Motor Works is the best choice for German car care in the South Bay.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I've been coming to Bay Area Motor Works for several years now. They always provide excellent customer service and are very thorough in getting the work I need done on my car...

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I do most of the work on our cars, and my daughter's 2003 BMW 325i is no exception.  For example, I recently replaced the rear differential and one of the motor mounts.  On occasion, I've taken the 325i down to Stevens Creek BMW to give me a diagnostic when I'm having trouble diagnosing the problem.  I try to never have them do any work though, because if you know anything about cars, it would become crystal clear that they charge well beyond what they should for the repairs they make (and they make repairs they shouldn't).

Anyway, my daughter brought the BMW home recently and it was overheating.  I was able to determine that the water pump had failed (the impeller had actually disintegrated).  I replaced the water pump, expansion tank, transmission thermostat, and flushed the entire cooling system to make sure I got all the impeller fragments out.  After filling the cooling system, I found that for some reason, I couldn't bleed all the air out of the system after many attempts to do so.  I feared that possibly my daughter had driven the car too long when the car had overheated and that she may have warped the cylinder head.

A friend had recently told me about William, saying he was the most honest BMW repair person you could hope to find, so I decided to give him a try.  Not only did he diagnose the problem (a cracked radiator, which I was unable to diagnose) he and the team at Bay Area Motor Works fixed it at a cost, and I probably shouldn't say this, probably lower than they should have.

Needless to say, I'm a huge fan!  While I'll continue to do as much of the repair work as possible on our cars, I'll be calling William and the team of experts at Bay Area Motor Works if I need help on our BMW.  I can honestly say he and his team are the most honest you'll find in the Bay Area...and I should know!</Review>< pics>

<Review>I was looking for a BMW car service center,
to take a look at a front-end job that was done recently by another shop,
which didn't seem right.

William took it for a test drive, agreed there was something wrong
so I wasn't imagining things, and left the car for day.

Turns out the other shop, after having replaced control arms, tie-rods and what have you,
forgot to tighten them down, even after I had the car brought to them for a second look,
and some were just finger tight.

We had the oil changed, William tightened things to spec
and now we have our car back in working condition.

William and his car service center, besides treating customers as they should be treated,
just got a customer for life.

Thank you William and all the people who are passionate about what they do!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Through a roundabout series of circumstances, I got a referral to BAMW and boy was I glad I did.  I did my research of reviews, and they are all correct.  The place is spotless. The mechanics are very well trained, polite, and friendly.  The work is done thoroughly to the last detail, and the prices are fair and reasonable.
I will be bringing my Audi back for the regular servicings as I feel it's a better value than the place on the corner.<//Review>

<Text>It is important to me that I leave from a Garage with confidence that not only has my car been repaired to my satisfaction, but that also possibly problems with which I was not aware have been found and fixed (with agreement obviously).  I have and will not only continue to have work done on my car at BAMW, but will recommend them to any of my friends or acquaintances. I might add that the repairs last longer than I expect, indicating the best of both quality work and parts.
Thank you William, and staff!

I also have been coming to BAMW for several years. I have a working knowledge of motor mechanics, (it being a hobby of mine), and I can tell you with confidence that the level of inspection and repair at BAMW  is without equal in the industry. William is my trusted mechanic and will get the job done right the first time at the right price. I highly recommend.</text>

The lady that does the eyebrows was completely rude to me this is the 3rd time I come to attempt to do my eyebrows every time I would come she would take someone that had come after me. Horrible service would never come back here again!</Text>

A first time ever, my feet was polished like a first grader polised them. The lady was trying so hard to upsale there was no focus on my request or my needs. Several comments about my unattended feet for awhile; which seemed very negative. I had no energy to explain, to fuss,  or to argue. I left so very very angry.</review>

They yell and argue with customers..I've only seen the main lady Rose speak up when customers get out of line but never when her workers do. A couple of them do good work, rose, the young one who sits in the front and the one with the blond beehive. It's a hit or miss whether your gonna be treated with respect..oh and careful with their lash services. I'm sure their I individuals are nowhere near code..they glue them underneath the lid.< /text>< pictures>

Im trying this place one more time. My acrylic nails were rushed and didn't even fit the shape of my real nails. I understand i came in 40 mins prior to closing time but I still shouldn't get crappy nails that broke off easily within a week. I'm trying this place one more time today so well see.</text>

I walked in on mother's day got attitude  by HBIC immediately all I needed was a nail repair and it's 45min to 1hr I say ok then she hits me with the we might not have that color mind you it's pink ...really B...I say ok I will just get a different one...then I get the eye roll...if I wasn't going out of town I would have waited for my own shop to open...bottom line their service stinks never again<//Review>

Called them up and they said come on in immediately. Got there and they started right after they finished with the person that was getting theirs done. Took about an hr maybe a little more time but when I saw my truck I was very pleased for such a good price. Great customer service, and just all around chill guys. Come here and you wont be disappointed. They even fixed some BS I did with my tent!</review>

<Review>Efficient .excellent customer service and fast.this was my first visit ,9 months later I have to tell the end of story ,I actually got my phone taken from my hand by the owner to write the review himself .I took my phone back and wrote Efficient , excellent, customer service and fast and left to work .After I checked the job,2 small rear windows ,tint was cut short and one rear window bubble. Not being negative but check the work before you leave ..< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

This is in regards to their phone and in person etiquette. NOT THE QUALITY OF THEIR TINT.

Basically when I was price checking different companies I was told to come in and they could get my car done that day. When I arrived they priced me at a full $100 more than jet black and other places nearby. Then told me I would have to wait because they had 3 cars ahead of me.

I wish they would've just told me that on the phone instead of having me drive there. I did specifically ask for time frames and prices and the person on the phone insisted I come in.<//Text>

They originally did the tint on my car from the dealership. The front windows peeled after allowing 72 hours to cure. I went back for them to fix it and they needed the car for 8 hrs. I went to Window Tinting A+ in Oakland they had both windows done in a hour and said 24 hr cure time was sufficient. Windows look Great! And no peeling after 2 months!<//Review>

Very happy with their work.  I hope i don't have issues with the tint (bubbles/peeling), but Mo assured me that if need be come back.  I was going for the 35% grade but Mo pointed out not only the difference but benefits.  After it was all said and done, my wife's silver VW GTI with the tint looks REALLY great!  I added a strip to the front windshield, which Mo suggested, and it really tied all of the windows and tint together.</Review>

<user_id>100291755230527143164< /user_id><review>I had my entire car tinted. While I balked at the price, I was ultimately impressed by how quickly and thoroughly the job was done. I had to go back today after a rear window break-in, and the guys patched me up within an hour and gave me an exceptional price. My only suggestion is to acquire electronic payment methods versus cash only. Overall, I am happy with Alameda Tint-N-Sound.< /review>< Pictures>

I left multiple messages to set up and appointment. I even went down to the facility at their expected time listed to open and waited 30 minutes. Nobody ever showed up. This was not a holiday or odd ball day. It was during the week. I used Vallejo Tint again as I have in the past.<//review>

He is the one who knows how to deal with customers for a business! I also came over this place a year ago for a tint on my previous Hyundai Accent and I was glad that Mark remembers me. I have peace of mind that Tint N Sound provides a lifetime warranty whenever there's an issue with tint films, such as bubbles, etc.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I visited this website, and saw an option to call to receive a price quote. In the mindset that this was a properly run business, I clicked on the button hoping to be forwarded to a voicemail or 1.800 after hour service. Nope. Some guy (guessing the owner) answers the phone and proceeds to being rude. I won’t be taking my business here. Why answer? Why list your personal number on a website? Especially, if you don’t want people to call? Stop being cheap and get a business phone line, and learn how to treat prospective clients.< /Text>

<review>I had a horrible experience here. The owner Alex couldn’t install my amp to my 12 inch subs and lied and made it seem like he knew what he was doing and essentially ruined my sound system to where I needed to get everything re-wired. He told me to come the next morning at 9 sharp and nobody ever showed up so that left me with my stereo still out and nothing was solved.

<text>I took in my new car and wanted to get pricing for tiniting the windows. It was pretty busy and I asked one of the guys how long it will be to get some info.
Alex (owner) started to talk to me and ask questions. Wants, needs, budget, and timing. He showed me all of the options and give his recommdations. He was extreamly helpful and answered all my questions.
He made me feel comfortable knowing that my car was in good hands! I was overjoyed with the outcome!! My car looks perfect now! Thank you Alex!!!< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Date>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>My son got his first car and asked for a new stereo for Christmas.  I paid $1800 cash for stereo, subwoofer, speakers and tint and a customized dashboard because stereo was smaller than the original one.
1.  Radio didn't work. Mark was going to order an antenna but never did. Nor did he call me.
2.  Tint job,  I can see the cut out on the window.
3.  Customize???  Ummm there are holes where the original dials were. He said he'd order a piece but I haven't heard from him and it's been 3 weeks.
4.  Wires behind the drivers seat were showing, had to have those hidden.

I brought the car to another shop. Come to find out, the adapter wasn't connected,  that's why radio didn't work. And the shop is working on customizing the dash so there are no holes too.

I'm a single mom of a teenage son.  I trusted Mark would do a great job and he seemed really nice.  Disappointed that he took my money,  half upfront because he had to buy the parts. And never followed up about the rest of the work. Now I'm out more $ bringing it to another shop that will fix it. Totally bummed. $1800 is a lot of money for a half ass job but he kept saying he'll order the piece for the dashboard and fix the radio.

I support Alameda small business and happy to pay extra,  my parents were small business owners,  I understand how hard it is to compete. But customer service is the key!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This is the worst business I have ever dealt with by far. “Mark” – his business license lists another name – damaged my car with a tint job and alarm system that didn’t work from the moment his workers installed it. When I returned a few days later at the agreed upon appointment after speaking to him three times, he said he didn’t have anyone on hand to fix the car. Within minutes he was physically and verbally abusive to me and my husband. Later, he called my cell phone and left more abusive messages on it, saying I had to take him to court and that he would come and damage my car if I did that. I would have filed a police report, but I was sure he would make good on his threats. Now I see other comments on Yelp that he’s threatened to do the same to other customers. DO NOT GIVE THIS GUY YOUR MONEY. He will make sure you regret it.</review>

<Review>Horrible service. I paid $700 in cash . Everytime I came here to get my stereo put it it was some type of excuse. And now he's telling me he won't give my money back after weeks of not installing . Going to take to claims court. DO NOT COME HERE.

When I asked about it the lady in the front desk gave me attitude and told me “unfortunately we are not able to help” atleast the manager noticed how poorly she handled the situation and repaid me with dorm dollars.

<Text>My daughter is a first year student at Chico. She was told by a staff member that she was on a 10 month lease and unknowingly signed a 12 month lease (3 months later). When she told her friends to check their lease agreements it appears they all have signed a 12 month lease. School ends in May. They are charging new students two extra months of rent knowing that these children assumed their lease would end when school ends. I think that the Social is taking advantage of NEW students and they should be ashamed.  If i could give Zero stars I would.</Text><username>danarah thompson< /username>< Date>

I honestly would not even give it one star. This was the worst place to live. When I first moved in my unit was dirty, I had them come clean the carpets because the bottoms of my family's feet and mine were black due to the dirty carpets.I came and talked to the staff stating this over and over day after day to when was eventually done 2 months later after the original request to clean the carpets, it was stated that there would be no fee, because they were at fault. If you want anything done here you will have to wait at the least 3 weeks for it to be reviewed.

The management here is rude, Jon the "manager" is extremely rude UNLESS he knows he going to get money from you. Which is extremely sad. The only time he showed an compassion is after the Camp Fire when he gave my roommate and I a tour of the apartment.

When I moved out they had not contacted me stating that they had received my keys. I did get a letter 3 weeks later stating that I will not get my full refund due to cleaning of the carpet and cleaning, which is absurd considering they charge me for something that I had done for them. Ironic.

I would not recommend this place for the rude attitudes the staff has, the mold that this place grows, and because there are many other places that offer more and that are cleaner for the same price. I mean there is a reason CSU, Chico  cut ties with them.</Text>

So living here was pretty much the only choice I had at the time of move-in since I didn't have nowhere else to live and I didn't look up apartments on time. Place is nice I shall say. Bradley is nice in quiet (Top Floor That Is) and I enjoy the peacefulness of it every step of the way. Food is okay. Sometimes I either starve myself or go find somewhere else appetizing to eat because Ham and tater tots for Brunch was not going to please or fill my stomach. My BIGGEST issue here though, is management's attitude, especially when it comes from leasing. When I have questions that I'm curious about, I get rude interruptions for me to be quiet while I wait.

Melanie is probably the only nice person I see at the Craig desks that I always look forward to talking to because she's not rude and has patience with us students. She loves her job and she also loves us! So living here is decent, kind-of expensive, leasing is impatient with you, and if you ever need any questions asked, I recommend you see Melanie first. She's going to be the only nicest girl at the desk for you and will not in any way be inconsiderate or rude about any questions you may have. Overall, if you're a freshman, you should live here!< /Text>

As of this moment, my experience living at Craig Hall has been enjoyable. On the positive side, the facility is beautiful and offers a wide variety of activities and commodities. As well as a friendly and kind staff, the food is decent and there are healthy and enough options.

As expected, the price feels a bit high, for the food and for rent alike, however as a college student anything can feel expensive. On top of that there are other unknown expenses that are unexpected. Including laundry,  parking pass, and a few others. Another issue is the hours when areas such as the c-store are opened. It can be quite inconvenient for a student who works a good deal.

Not a bad first experience for a dorm, as long as the resident is optimistic and seeks to make the most of their time there it will be a positive experience.< /Text>

ATTENTION ALL STUDENTS and PARENTS of students living at Craig Hall: Craig Hall is not affiliated with the CSU Chico campus. Craig Hall is a property managed by Sequoia Equities, Inc. Craig Hall rents out their apartments and rooms which they refer to as dorms. Craig Hall has to abide by the same California landlord/tenant laws as all other California rental properties. To reside at Craig Hall, Craig Hall says that all freshman are required to purchase their FLEX PLAN MEAL PLANS. Craig Hall is NOT a college campus. Is this legal? Please consult with your attorney to see if this is a violation of California Landlord/Tenant laws. I don't believe landlords can force tenants to purchase meal plans, nor refuse to rent to anyone who refuses to purchase a meal plan. Know your rights!

Also, I would not recommend this place to anyone. For your information, you should also be aware that the lease includes the following warning: Detectable amounts of chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm may be found in and/or around this facility. (Proposition 65, California Health and Safety Code, Section 25249.5).< /Review>

<Review>PLEASE STAY AWAY! pay attention to bad reviews. If you trying to avoid a scam. This company advertising promotions and don't respect them they will tell you they still have the promotion going on just so you can sign the lease and then 2 minutes after asking them and signing the lease they tell you they no longer have the promotion. Haven't even moved in and already started with the scams now we are stuck with this lease of a scam! Please rent somewhere else that is not here I truly advise all parents and students this. Now I know why they have 2 stars. They don't care to resolve the issue, there responds was that it was a miss understanding and they apologize. Apologize are accepted but with a solution if it wasn't a scam. But since it is a scam that's the reason they don't bother or care to resolve the issue since they already got what they wanted out of you  which is to sign the lease.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Craig student living is the most disgusting and rude environment I ever lived in. The staff is racist and rude to Africa Americans that come to their facilities. They do not fulfill the tenant request when things are broken in their facilities. The rooms are disgusting and dirty before you move in. Their housing pricing are very high for a "student living." Food is disgusting. They make students pay $100 dollars for parking. They kick students out for  ridiculous reasons without even giving them a 30 day notice. I feel like they target minorities more than the white people who stay there. They put on this facade that their so diverse, but really discriminate against minorities or people they don't won't in their facilities. If your living here now be careful they like to play hungry student out their money. I don't recommend ANYONE in Chico to stay in this student dump. PS: they give bad reviews to students they dislike, when you decided to leave the living dump . I give this housing 10 dumbs downs for being terrible in staffing and for having broken down rooms that don't look like the show room.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Worst place to live! You will be scammed and cheated! Do Not Rent Here! The management, the service, the rooms offered, the facility is HORRIBLE!!!

The website listed that rent per 2 bedroom was $535, only to find out that my roommate and I HAVE to pay $675 each! In addition, my roommate has to pay monthly meal plan (forced). We were already upset as we have already signed the lease and moved in. It was such a mislead.

More disappointments followed: After moving into my unit, I found out the room don’t even have AC, instead there are cool air in which all rooms share from. The room gets super humid and hot during warm season, and the air chiller barely cools the temperature in the room. The site listed “AC PROVIDED,” another mislead!

After moving in and inspecting my unit, it’s clear that the unit wasn’t properly cleaned. The carpet is dirty, not even washed nor vacuumed.  The irony is that after moving out, they charged me for not cleaning my unit, when clearly I did. I left the unit exactly the way it was when I first moved in. The only difference was that I actually cleaned my unit before leaving.

So my question is, they deducted fees from my deposit money, but do they really use that money to clean the rooms? As I mentioned earlier, when I first moved in my unit, it wasn’t clean as claimed.

It was a big mistake to rent this place, and I don’t even know how they’re still in business when they’re conducting unethical rules and management. Good luck to future residents.</text>

<Review>My first year at Craig Hall has been great! Compared to on-campus living, I have also saved a ton of money. The RA’s, staff and maintenance are so helpful and welcoming. I would definitely recommend living at Craig Hall.< /Review><userid>104558331998554165702<//userid>< resp>

<Text>This place really sucks. The whole time I've been here my air conditioning system has not worked at all despite various complaints. The WiFi is super slow! Their food is somewhat good or slightly better than campus but sometimes they just be serving crap. The rooms and buildings are super old and stuffy all the time. I feel like I'm living in a 50s crack-house/motel. They have some really rude staff as well, especially the girls working the mail room office. Speaking of the mail room, they are always changing their hours and I feel like most of the time they just close whenever the hell they feel like it. They are always using the excuse that they are "short staffed" but how the hell are they not able to afford to hire a couple more people when each resident pays $500+ a month?! The only reason why I am living here is because it is way  cheaper than on campus and I did not know anyone before coming here. I guess the only good thing that I got out of this is that I was able to save money and make new friends. Other than that, I would say  don't live here if you are able to afford something else.<//Text><UserId.>116081175792974305140<//UserId.></record>

< review>
About four years ago in my senior year of high school I attended a basketball camp at Chico state, where the whole team stayed at Craig while we attended the camp. While I enjoyed being able to build and bond with my teammates in an environment outside of school, I also enjoyed how big the rooms we all stayed in were, and how the place had security too. Four years later I found myself right back at Craig visiting my best friend Danielle who's an RA in the same building I stayed in all those years ago. I'm happy to say the place is just as nice as it was when I visited the first time, not to mention her room was even bigger than the rooms my teammates and I stayed in. She then introduced me to a few of the other RAs and gave me a tour of the grounds. I was happy to see she was happy with the accommodations the place had to offer. Hope to visit her again soon< /review>

This is my 2nd school year staying here and I've had the best experience. Every staff here makes you feel welcome and they all care about you. Justine and Lucy have been an amazing help. Both of these ladies have helped me with questions and concerns. When there's things that are unclear or I feel like they need to be explain to me, they will take time from what they are doing and sit with you to make sure all your questions are answered. Make sure you stop by and say hi to either one of them, you'll walk out with a big smile that will make you want to stop by more often. When looking for student housing, nothing will beat The Social Chico. They have a free shuttle for all residents that takes you to the CSU, they also have a gym open to their residents 24/7. If you do not feel like buying groceries and cooking them yourself make sure you get yourself their meal plan.They have an amazing kitchen were you can get your 3 meals a day and the best part is ALL YOU CAN EAT! I enjoyed my stay here so much I already saved my spot for my 2019-20 school year. Make sure you save your spot before they are all gone!< /text>

This was a terrible place to live. Contact me and I will tell you my story. Don't buy into the positive reviews. I don't believe them. I think they are employees writing them. You do not want to live here. You do not want to have to deal with the amount of homeless people and the drugs that go on.</text>

<date>1535238786881<//date><review>This place is a rip off, it's so expensive here as if they don't consider us college students don't already have tuition and books to pay for. My rent and meal plan costs more than I am receiving in my financial aid. I cant even afford to wash my clothes here. We don't get free cable. If I could go back in time I would have looked somewhere else. Please save your self from the trouble, now I have to drop one of my college classes and find a way to manage working and going to college to pay for my rent, I am EXTREMELY unsatisfied! I didnt know my meal plan wouldn't be included into my rent. I got the lowest meal plan and its $2000 a year. They also want $4900 right now for rent per semester. This is so wrong. I got a single renovated dorm and it looks nothing like renovated. My room smells like mildew and the sinks are leaking water and there is water leaking from the ceiling outside of my dorm, I am miserable living here!!< /review><GmapID>0x808327a91474941f:0x4081d3abd185e6ed</GmapID><Rating>1</Rating>< user_name>

<Text>DO NOT rent here! Campus dorms were full so this was one of our options. I really wish I had read reviews before signing the contract. Bus is always broke down or “out of service” due to family emergencies!?? Unbelievable how many excuses this place has! If it’s not the bus it’s the store that will be closed. We decided to buy the meal card out of convenience because our daughter is a freshman which was a total mistake! Food is horrible and for the last hour cold food is left out to be eaten (she has a late class so she gets screwed for dinner). Shes found hair in her food twice and the selection is not what we were promised! So we now pay $300 a month for  meal plan she hardly ever uses. Aside from all of this the air  coolers are always broken and “being serviced” my poor daughter had to suffer through over of week of summer temps and no cool air. I literally would love to have one thing nice to say about this place but I can’t find one. My daughters first year of college has been a battle because of this place. We (her parents) live over 12 hours away and
Thought we could count on this place to keep our daughter comfortable as it was her first time leaving home.
Update:
During the wildfires our daughters severe asthma was acting up. She could hardly breathe in Chico. the Dr directed her to come home until the air quality got better. School closed down so it was not going to affect her schooling. She was home almost 3 weeks.  I called and asked Craig Hall to work with us being that this was an unexpected expense in flying her home and back  because she was unable to stay per Drs orders. The receptionist was rude and said it didn’t matter there was nothing they could do for us because they were not evacuated and she should have just stayed. Are you kidding me????? It was life threatening to her on top of all that most kids didn’t stay it was a state of emergency they could see the fires coming towards Chico. Shame on you Craig Hall! I hope no other parent have to experience what we have had to go through and she’s still contracted to stay until May. Lord help her<//Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1543970054039, 'text': "Hello Rosie and Saydee,\n\nI am sorry to hear that you have concerns about your time here at Craig. Luckily we may be able to help clear things up right away as we do not have any record of these being brought to our attention.\n\nWe do apologize about last Monday when we had to do a sudden repair on the C-Shuttle, and thankfully we were able to offer a 12 passenger van running constantly that day to cover it.  We do understand and apologize for the inconvenience of the shuttle run Monday through Thursday being shortened by an hour and a half when we lost a driver suddenly. We promise we are working on finding a second driver again!\n\nThe food in our dining hall run by Sodexo provides a large variety of food all prepared fresh daily including fresh vegetables, salads, soups and even vegan and vegetarian dishes. If Saydee has encountered an issue we can assure you it would be remedied immediately if brought to a dining employee's attention. If you would like me to send you the full menu for the week I would be more than happy to get that to you so you can see all of the amazing options that Sodexo is serving. She is also able to get food to go in the Cafe using her meal plan which would help with her late class schedule.\n\nIn regards to the air in her room, I don't see any work orders on Saydee's or her roommate's account about an issue. We actually have no resident requests for this unit since 2016.  Was it a routine maintenance check that you are referencing? If they have a problem we want to fix them right away so please never hesitate to reach out immediately if you felt something wasn't addressed.\n\nDuring the Camp Fire, the City of Chico was thankfully not under an evacuation order for any period of time, and Craig as a place of residence including all of our amenities were open and available.  Although we understand smoke affected people locally including our own staff and those who were suddenly without homes, as well people in areas extending hundreds of miles from Chico, we are unfortunately unable to credit any rent due to a resident choosing to leave during that time. Much like a homeowner choosing to take a trip due to air quality, a lending institution would not then be able to credit a mortgage payment.\n\nI hope that this was able to clear up any confusion. We would love the chance to speak to you in person so we can be sure the rest of your stay is enjoyable! Please do not hesitate to reach out directly if you have any questions and we hope the end of the semester is a great one!\n\nRegards,\nThe Craig Team"}<//resp>

I could write a super long review about how bad this place is and the VERY many problems with the actual living situations as well as the terrible staff but I would advise anyone that is considering to live here to really go check anywhere else first, there are three brand new student living place that are going to be open soon, go check those out! Also if you do decide on living here ask to see a room other than the show model, the show models are NOTHING like you will get, all the appliances are basically from the 1980s and if you are confused why your apartment is different then say your neighbors, they don't really care, they'll just say appliances vary, the two good things about this place are the RAs who know how bad this place is and just feel bad so they try to make activities for residents, and the maintenance staff, they are pretty reliable and kind, but other than that and the few front desk people that are kind, the place is somewhere I would never recommend.< /Review>

It is true that different apartments may have different appliances however I can assure you they are modern appliances.  It is common to have differing appliances in any rental you may have in the future due to brand availability over time. If they are in working order we would not need to replace them, however If anyone experiences a malfunctioning appliance we would most certainly repair or replace it for them.

I do not suggest living here. There were cockroaches infesting my room the second I moved in and they took two weeks to do anything about it. No payment plan was explained well and they did not inform me there was a kitchen for upper classman even when I informed them I was an upper classman and instead had me sign up for a meal plan that I could not afford. I then had to break my lease and was unable to get any money back. This place honestly feels like it traps people and drains them of every last cent it can get from them.</Text>

<Text>Update: 9/22/19 - reached out via email during business hours on 9/19 as requested in the owner's response (see below.) Have received no return communication.

So this is our son's second year at Craig/The Social and I'm not sure if we would have come back if we weren't concerned about the tight housing market following the Camp Fire. It's a mixed bag, for sure.

First the good: he says maintenance staff and RAs are very nice. The general facility is old but reasonably well kept, if you don't mind the absolutely punishing driveways that are more pothole than asphalt. The food is decent, though the morning hours on the dining hall can be tricky if you have an early class at Butte College. Better stock up on bagels!

The challenging: office hours are spotty, much like the C-store, and GOOD LUCK if you need to call. It takes a miracle to get a return call or email. Some of the management are super condescending to parents. I can only imagine how they treat residents.

The supremely uncool: billing is kind of a mess. We signed a new lease for our second year back in March and said on the form we wanted the same room, meal plan, etc. So this year when the first payment came due (there's never a breakdown, you just get an amount owed) it was approximately the right amount & I paid it. Three weeks later at move in (yup, you pay for 3 wks of meals & rent your kid doesn't use!) my kid had...no meal plan. I got lucky, he was trying to sort it out and they accidentally called me instead of him. It was made out to be my fault ("You never filled out the paperwork!" - they send the paperwork electronically to your account & I signed everything they sent...) but we did eventually get him fed. They were going to have someone from billing call me to straighten out how I paid almost $1000 when rent is $699 but still had no meal plan, but it's been nearly a month and nobody has called yet LOL I won't hold my breath.

This is par for the course.

Oh, and this year they "upgraded" the internet access from ethernet drop to all wifi, which works about as well as you'd predict in a huge cinderblock building with the access points in the hallways. Their solution to our connectivity problems? "You need to buy better hardware." So we did, and he still can't use the internet reliably enough to do homework or game with friends or chat with his brother. Less than ideal. Guess we'll see how it works out, so far management seems unwilling to help. Right now, two stars feels generous.</Text><Resp>{'time': 1568657533780, 'text': "Bethany, we're sorry to hear you've had difficulty reaching us.

<date>1431035426258< /date><rating>1<//rating><Review>Craig student living has the worst costumer service of any company I have ever dealt with. The leasing office is all for signing you up for one of their very much overpriced leases. Once you are set in your lease the staff is very discourteous, unhelpful, and very unprofessional. When moving in the A/C unit in my room was very loud and did not work well. I put in a work order and someone was there within an hour, great right. Well instead of fixing the problem the maintenance worker disconnected the unit and left, I continued to put in work orders and I finally had to go in and re-wire it to get what little air out of it that we could. I had to wait another 3 days until I had it, had to go find the owner/ manager and tell her to finally get someone in to fix it. Specifically Victoria in the leasing office. Our conversation ended with her having lots of attitude with me just for trying to acquire information over the phone about moving out. She is the only reason I am writing this review. Throughout the year the dorms had outbreaks of mold, bugs, and times with no hot or even running water. I would never go back to this student housing for they seem to have never thought of the customer happiness. All they think about is let’s charge these people as much as possible with doing as little work as we can. I will say one thing the Resident Advisers and the dining hall staff were always helpful and happy.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

For my room, the air conditioning runs constantly but does not cool my room down. Their was a slight leak from the ceiling in the hall but has thus stopped.  It may just be that the building is very old.   I have to say that the staff here is great.

Edit: changed to 4 stars now that the weather has cooled down. I give The Social a 4/5 when temperature is not a concern, and 3/5 when it is.</Review>

<response>{'time': 1565209939324, 'text': 'Diane, I am so sorry to hear there was confusion about the meal plan and events. I wholeheartedly encourage our residents or guarantors to reach out if they have any questions. We have two other meals plans that can provide unlimited meals all weekdays,  or unlimited meals 7 days a week with only a small  monthly increase in cost. Our RA team have office hours every night during the school year from 6:00 pm to 11:00 pm and additionally patrol the halls every night. We also provide meeting request cards and boxes outside every RA room just in case our students wish to schedule a time with them personally. Our Resident Advisors come up with activities for the year every summer and we put up a monthly activities board in the main lobby by our front desk and game room, as well as post to all building doors, hall posting boards and social media for our upcoming events. We will continue to implement these same policies for the 2019-2020 year as we love having our students participate in our planned events! I would love the opportunity to speak to you further to best understand how we may improve on our existing services to better serve our residents each year so please do not hesitate to reach out!

Was an over all "Okay" experience for our freshman son. Room was ok, food was ok, noise was ok. His floor was practically like a hotel floor minus the elevator. He had to walk a very long hallway and climb 3 flights of stairs with laundry, groceries etc. The times I went to visit, no other residents were seen. Like creepy quite for a "dorm". The closest exit was an emergency door, always locked. RA's were none existent. He could go hunt them down if needed, however as a parent we were under the impression our new freshman would be checked on and invited to activities by an actual person coming by his room. The food program was very unclear, our Son lived on oatmeal and peanut butter trying to conserve his 180 meals, to last the school year. Going to cafe only 1 meal a day. Come to find out the 180 meals were renewed at new semester. So we wasted money on uneaten meals and our son lost 10 lbs. The contract was very unclear on this. The snack room
(where my son went at end of year, to try and spend unused funds) lady told my son it happens all the time, so employees are aware of this problem. Thankfully he found a great group of friends in other clubs, so his freshman year went well.<//review>

Butte Collage should be ashamed of themselves for advertising this place. They will find any way to scam you of your money. The staff is consistently not at work, the custodians can't fix anything, and the leasing office are straight up charlatans when talking to parents to convince them to get their kids here. For the same price as an apartment you can live in one of these prison cells.
But worry not potential leaser, I am happy to inform you that there are a verity of drugs you can obtain here, large bike racks that serve as window displays for theifs(every week there is another bike missing), and the gunshots in the night will keep you sound asleep.
This is just a sample of the awfulness that I have experienced along with many others I have talked to. If you care at all for your living conditions and community DO NOT LIVE HERE.< /text>

I see no work order requests from you this school year, nor any notes to indicate you have brought any concerns to us during your stay. We have had no reports of bike theft this year and just like the university and other properties, bike racks secured to the ground provide students a safe way to store their bikes as long as they are properly locked up. We are very confused about your report of gunshots heard at night as none of our staff, courtesy patrol or Chico PD has notified us of any such incidents here at any time in our history of ownership. We are happy to help address resident concerns as they are brought to us so we can work to make things right.

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>If I could give this place zero stars, trust me I would. The food and office staff are horrible at their jobs. Although I do really love the cafe and C-store employees, but that's because they're all college students like us. I paid $9,000 for the whole year and looking back I wouldn't even pay half that to live there for another year. I got charged $250 for an "Epoxy Stain/Replace" upon moving out. What is that!? I didn't cause anything that wasn't already there when I moved in. You can forget about getting your $500 deposit back. I also got an alcohol fine, $250. Why? They just want to make money off of you. My biggest regret in my whole life was living at Craig Hall.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Lucy clearly enjoys the “people” aspect of his position. Has become the “go to guy” for students who seek his advice to solve problems, it was a pleasure to walk by the front office and always be greeted by her. I wouldn't go to anyone else in that office Lucy was always by the far the best in her department! So I gave her a 5 star</text>< pictures>

<Text>Where should I start?
Excellent Customer Service
Attentive to Parents and Students
Security, friendly staff, room was spacious
Flexible lease options

My daughter stayed here for the first year in a single renovated suite.  She has enjoyed it and has no complaints.  When we were not originally given a space in the dorms, I was deeply concerned at the idea of her living in an apartment.  I met Nicole on campus (CSU Chico) and adored her.  She was easy going yet professional.  She was personable and answered my many questions and concerns based on reviews I had read online.  She encouraged me to come visit.  We finished orientation late and got there after hours.  We met Emily,  who was off work already.  Emily called and got approval to still give us the tour so that I did not have to miss it considering we drove from Southern California.  Craig has many laundry facilities,  cafeteria, and Starbucks near pool.  In the past year, no complaints from my daughter.  In fact, she renewed her lease from dorm to apartments.  Craig had an RA per floor also which allowed for the dorm room experience,  without being stacked in rooms like sardines!

Staff
Ariel is the person who normally answers the phone when I call.  Her voice is always pleasant with excellent customer service.  She does great and is always willing to assist however possible. I missed my daughter and would call to ask different questions about activities and other mom things. I can call to  speak with Lucy for billing concerns.  She responds quickly and is always ready to offer solutions to any concerns.  Justine is the manager and is eager to assist and provide feedback. She is focused on making sure all details are addressed and willing to work on behalf of her residents.   She treats each person and issue like they are the only concern until everything is corrected.  Liberty is the newest to the group of dynamic ladies.  She knows the rules as if reading a textbook so feel free to ask her anything!  My favorite person is still Nicole because of the impression she gave on initial contact!

I have trusted my daughter with them and feel comfortable knowing she is in their hands complete with rules and regulations.   They even have a period of time around finals where they require no guest and quiet hours!  I loved this place! My daughter also just got her first job working there which shows she loves it too when she could have applied anywhere.

Hope this helps you!   They have made a difference for us.  Knowing my daughter is safe, great place to live, responsible staff and affordable rent, has helped a great deal.

Its okay, wouldn't live here again. I live in the apartments and there was a security who kept checking to see if we were drinking in the apartment. Made us throw away any alcohol in the house, threatened to have us evicted because there was a minor in the apartment (1 week shy of 21 btw) and one empty beer can on the table. Food is really not worth the price. They also have ridiculous fees, I left my keys indoors once and they charged me $5 to open the front door, it was 2pm on a Friday not even an inconvenience. There's also a staff member who's really irritating in the dining hall, but that part is just be me. Most of them are fine.  Also the walk back at night after parties sucks.<//Text>

I do overall think the experience is great, everyone was very nice my RA Coree was probably the best RA I could ever have. She is always there when we need anything, real chill.

Currently live in the apartments and its really sub-par for what im paying ($900 a month) I could live at Post on Nord for what I pay. Screwed me into a meal plan I couldn't cancel even between semesters (im a 2nd year and still forced into meal plan). They have done 6 (yes, 6) inspections of my apartment in 8 months. All of them were for "safety inspections" which should really only be done once in a lease term. They were also rebranded this year, in hopes to save the complex I guess. However due to this they essentially began renovating the entire complex. Very abnormal for any complex to begin large amounts of construction mid semester, and issues with internet. When I complained about the printer not working, they told me to my face they were switching internet problems MID SEMESTER. He told me they knew there were issues but they wouldnt last long, except the internet issues have lasted 3 weeks. The leases on these apartments also resemble a dorm more than an apartment. There are rules to every small thing you do, such as no candle burning or alchohol possesion regardless of age. Which is a complete joke, its my apartment and I think I can burn a candle like an adult if I want. The staff doesn't care and I have called on my neighbors for a noise complaint 4 times with no consequences. Should have listened to the reviews. Stay away.</text>

Craig is AWFUL. It's a complete rip off. You can considerate the ghetto of all the dorms. The food is disgusting. They completely rip you off. And it's not a safe place to live. My roommates put cleaning bleach in my shampoo and they did nothing as a reprocussions. Some rooms have mold.< /review>

<date>1441216231648<//date><text>I agree with the majority of the reviews. As a facility, it isn't the best place, but my RA Coree was the coolest person ever. She basically dedicated much of her time to her residents and made sure we were always okay. She never slept but she never complained about it.Someone was always asking something of her. She never turned a cold shoulder towards anyone and accepted everyone for who they were. Yes, the complex may not be the nicest but this is college housing, not princess Dianna's castle. Yes the building is old and not everything works as it should, but most of the problems ACTUALLY come from non-cooperative residents. Overall, my RA Coree was inclusive. She added the calm for the transition from high school to college. No matter the situation, I felt safe mentally and physically. Because of her, I had a great experience here and wouldn't have it any other way.</text>< gmap_id>

During my stay here if I ever wanted to have my AC on I had to wear headphones due to its loudness. If you want a burger everyday for a year then the Craig dining hall is just for you! Oh and when you go to the gym, if you want to run on the treadmill make sure you look down while running to make sure you don't get your foot stuck in the giant hole that's been on the machine for months.</Review>

My daughter has lived at Craig for a year now and here are some observations:
*The general manager is responsive to the needs of parents and students; she returns calls promptly and is dedicated to hearing and fixing problems
*Food service staff will work with special dietary needs
*The transportation network worked well
*Sales staff accommodated future needs for students studying abroad
*Rent is a good value
*The mail service is very inefficient; my daughter's medicines were often left unattended and undelivered for days. This was after multiple tries by her to get her packages.
*The behaviors of some students is abysmal and causes many problems with rule violations
*The automated telephone system using the Google contact number is problematic
*Student staff may not have the right answers at times

Overall the  experience is good and the management is looking for ways to make improvements.<//Review>

<resp>{'time': 1508792323451, 'text': "Hi Kary,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave feedback.  We are sorry to hear that you have some concerns regarding your room and food.  Our dorm rooms are all the same size and furnished the same.  They are identical to the model we show with the exception that the model is decorated and we allow our residents to decorate their own room.  I see you did just add a meal plan this month.  As a new dining hall attendee, it is important to know that our chefs and dining hall staff and management are there to not only listen to your feedback, but also to help advise our residents on all of the available options from our fresh salad bar, to grill, deli, hot line and even our Starbucks Cafe with to-go meal options.  As they haven't yet heard from you, I encourage you to pay them a visit!\nSincerely,\n\nJon Timko\nCommunity Manager"}</resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Once you, the parent, signs the lease, Craig Student Living imposes random fines on the students without substantiation.  It is a slick way to increase the revenue of the organization at your cost.  Continuously and without any recourse, there is a failure to fix or maintain such things as a malfunctioning air condition, poor heating, broken desk chairs in the dorm rooms, etc.   There is absolutely no communication.  As a parent, I have called and asked to speak to the resident director, Kindra Adcock, several times who is never in the office, does not return calls and exhibits absolutely no customer service abilities.  I resorted to sending a certified letter that still remains unanswered.  I notified this organization of a change in my banking account and executed the documentation authorizing them to withdraw the funds from the new account.  Weeks later, my daughter receives a notice that there were insufficient funds in the account in which they were notified of and given the correct account.  She was told she could be evicted or her flex account, which I pay, would be suspended.  This is an account specific for her to eat while living in the dorm.  I have a severe problem with threatening to disallow her to eat as a result of their ineptitude.  PLEASE DO NOT SUBJECT YOUR CHILD TO A YEAR, YES YOU MUST SIGN FOR A YEAR, OF WHAT WILL AMOUNT TO A MISERABLE FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE.  This should be a great memory in their lives not a nightmare in yours.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Time>1525063340900< /Time><review>Craig hall finds anyway to take your money. The food is terrible and it's the same thing every day , pizza and Burgers . The only time they have decent food during Chico preview day because they want to fool the parents to make it seem that the food is going to be good. The first day I arrived the fridge had mold and , the room was not vacuumed and there was dust everywhere. The ac does not work and if you put I work order in for the ac it's takes three months for them to fix it . The day I checked out I literally cleaned it 10 times better than when I got there . And they took mine and all of my roommates 500 deposit. For stuff that was already there when we got there. All the stuff that they charged us for we put on the paper that they give us when we get there , but they still took our 2,000 dollars . And don't try to call about the deposit after you leave because if you just mentioned the deposit they hang up in the rudest matter . And I emailed about and it's been 2 years and I'm still waiting on a reply. And the security guards are creeps always trying too peek into windows so close your curtains</review>< rate>

I advise incoming freshmen going to Chico State to NOT live here. It is the worst place you can possible live in. Not only is it overly priced but they screw you over in multiple ways. The food is similar to that of a prison. If you no longer choose to go to Chico State, Craig hall will force you to break your lease and pay a RIDICULOUS amount of 2,500 plus the remaining amount left of your rent. Not to mention that they do a horrible job with pairing you with roommates. To top it off your floormates are not even in same age group. Craig hall is known for having a bad reputation...<//text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>This place is very cold. At my time at craig, The communication system was unfair. When incase of an emergency and your life is at risk while living here don’t rely on the staff (including the courtesy patrol) to notify you about what’s going on. They just flee the whole student living while your in danger without even knowing. How are we supposed to be safe when an emergency happens and we’re in danger and all they do is flee without notifying us or giving us any detailed information. They are just greedy and want our money they don’t even care about the safety of us students! I’m suprised this place is even still in business, I wouldn’t suggest living here, check out the brand new housing like the post on nord, campus walk or even cedar flats instead it’s way cheaper.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Thank you for your response to Saydee Martinez(sorry her google acct must have been open when I posted the original review)

Yes, our daughter has had a very difficult time there to say the least.

1. As far as your response to the shuttle it has not just been last Monday.  This has been an ongoing constant problem since day 1.
2. The air WAS out for over a week in the beginning of September of course there was no maintenance request.  You sent us an email that stated "Maintenance was working on getting it fixed".  I made 2 phone calls to your office during that time and was told it was getting handled. Those kids were stuffed in those dorms in that heat for over a week.  Do not deny that.
3.  There was no wifi for the first week and that was also "getting taking care of by maintenance".  So again why would we file a report when we we received an email stating internet wifi was in the works.
4. We never asked for credit for her rent.  NOT once!  We simply asked if you would be patient with us being that she had to buy a flight home and back because of health issues.  Do not try and make it seem as if the fire was no big deal in Chico.  The kids were standing outside and ash was showering them in the streets talk about scary huh.  Can you imagine not being able to breathe in that.  I know these are personal issues. Those fires were a huge deal and there were many kids who went home for their own safety because we all know you were very close to evacuation. The University & Butte were both shut down mostly because of air quality not being healthy for anyone.  But because there were no "evacuation orders" you show zero compassion for the kids who had to leave.  You all are like oh well so sorry  Rent & Meal cards need weather you were here wearing a mask or not.  SMH!   My daughters health was at risk and I know your response was  "in the contract" and blah blah. Lastly let me say that a mortgage company, a Landlord, Credit Card Co etc. would in fact take into consideration that there was a natural disaster such as this and work with you to find the best solution or at least stretch out an extension.< /Text>< userid>

<review>This review is coming from a butte college freshman student who lived in the dorm not the apartment. Also my experience on staff and RA's will be different than others because this company gets new staff frequently and this was just my experience from my 1 year.

What I liked about this place:
-I met great friends
-Location is not bad at all
-As a butte student having a bus stop nearby helped tons

What made it terrible:
-Expect to be overpaying by tons, like seriously I could have rented an apartment for half the cost. This is especially a ripoff as a freshman where they force you to purchase one of their meals plans.

-Speaking of the meal plans it is not worth it, not at all. Here are some reasons why.

~Half of the Sodexo employees show absolutely no respect or patience towards their customers. I was given attitude and snarky comebacks on a daily basis.
~ All the meals they provide are beyond budget, your 10 dollar all you can eat meal is actually just your choice of several "high school lunch quality" dishes that are usually not cooked enough and are bad quality.
~ I saw many many instances of poor sanitary practice, anywhere from finding lipstick on the clean cups they have out to discovering for several weeks they used cold water to clean their dishes.
~I got sick many times from eating here and this led to a huge unhealthy weight loss for me.

- And lastly, a large number of staff is disrespectful towards their residents. I am going to be honest, I can only think of a couple workers here that really made me feel at home. Many of the other workers put their attitudes ahead of their work and this led to a lot of conflict between workers and residents (Not just myself included)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My experience prior to signing up: I received a tour of the building by one of the better employees who did an amazing job at selling it to us and by treating me and my family with great respect (They gave us miniature water bottles on a day well over 100 degrees). This hospitality is what made us so excited to live here as it seemed like a great opportunity.

My experience after signing out: The same employee who gave me the tour was the one to help me sign out and she treated me with a lot of help and respect but I can't say the same about the employee I talked to right after. But sure enough right after I signed my name, gave my keys, and said bye, I decided to try to get another water bottle from the front counter (another 100+ day same time of year). The front desk worker was extremely rude to me telling me that I am not allowed to take their water since I don't live there and they told me that my remaining 25 dollars to spend at their c store is no good, she said this not even 1 minute after me signing my name to leave. Terrible terrible service.

Would I recommend it? Of course not, I wasted a lot of money and was not given nearly what we were promised. Am I glad that I made friends and had some good experiences while living there? Definitely but that was all this place had going for me and that's where the 2nd star comes into this review.

Oh also, they take a large chunk out of your deposit no matter how well you left the room, I did absolutely no damage throughout the year and I cleaned and vacuumed before leaving. Sure enough weeks later I get my deposit check back with over 120 dollars in fees taken out of it. Everybody I talked to that lived here this happened to.

I am just gonna call this 2 star generous.< /review><Resp>{'time': 1500329516693, 'text': 'Hi Drake,\n\nI am very sorry you experienced even one instance that left you feeling like this was not home as it is our goal to make sure our residents have a positive experience. I would love the opportunity to discuss this further including any details of poor customer service on the part of my Craig Staff.  I take customer service very seriously here at Craig, and I am always available to help.  In order to be able to assist you, it is very important to voice these concerns to us right away if something occurs, because we want to be able to address them in real time, assuring you or anyone else, never leaves unhappy.\n\nI will be sure to forward your comments about staff etiquette to our Sodexo GM as he by no means condones any of his staff treating their customers with anything but the utmost respect and kindness. Letting us know immediately when this happens is helpful as they want to ensure whichever employee has caused a problem does not do so for anyone else.  I am so sorry to hear the dining hall meals were not to your liking.  Our dining hall GM loves feedback, and they are always available to speak.  They want to tailor menus to our students needs so if you have any feedback I am happy to put you in contact with them.\n\nIn regards to health and safety, Sodexo has very stringent sanitation, health, and cleanliness policies and they run more strictly than a standard restaurant.  Sodexo has had zero instances of food borne illness during the time they have run our kitchen and we are regularly inspected and passed by the health department.  The health department has always been happy to advise any concerned party of their outstanding attention to food safety by Sodexo here at Craig.\n\nI do apologize that we were unable to apply your Flex points to the water purchase after your move-out, I can assure you this was not done with malice.  Once a resident moves out, the system suspends their meal cards and they are unable to be used again.  This is to prevent unauthorized use of a past account and is an intended safety functionality of our system.\n\nThank you for taking the time to offer us feedback as it gives me the opportunity to make sure we can always offer the best possible experience.  I hope you take the time to call me so I can discuss in more detail.\n\nJon Timko\nCommunity Manager\nCraig Student Living'}</Resp>< pics>

(Includes responce to "Owner")
Where do I start? TLDR: Just about the only thing great about this place is matanance. Don't live here, especially the apartments, if you can afford somewhere else.

Mostly my problems lie with management. Since before I signed my lease, and up till my 8th month living here, I was told by management staff and RAs both that if I had problems I couldn't resolve with my roomates, I could start mediation and roomate agreements proceedings with the RAs. I live in the apartments, so I knew it was more free living than the doorms, but I was reassured every time I would have support.

When it got to the point my roomates were threatening me with harmful violence and I asked for help, I was told in no uncertain terms that I wasn't getting any help from management or the RAs. I was left to confront my roomates alone, who I was afraid of, with blunt truths.

The thing was, that during all this, I saw them giving a tour to a prospective leaser, and the woman handling the tour, one who told me they wouldn't help because I was in the apartments, told them that management and RAs would help if any problems arose with roomates if they chose to live in the apartments.

Their process of selecting roomates is a joke. While i was in an apartment for four people, one left two weeks into the lease. I think she knew what was going to happen.

I am a quiet person and was looking for a place to study and hang when not in class. I got stuck with two people who proceeded to ignore the fact that I pay to use the kitchen and living space as well as my room. They proceeded to tell me, eventualy, that I basicly had no right to use the common area and kitchen while they could. They were up till 3 am partying the weekend before I had a final, and I couldn't study. Everytime I told them I was taking a final, they would give me the evil eye and reluctantly be quiet. I could hear one roomate through my EAR PLUGS. Not headphones mind you, but acctual ear plugs meant for sleeping. I also think I got stuck with the rejects of the applicants.

The food here is a joke. While it was good at first, I started to get sick after the second semester started. It got to the point I just stopped eating here. It's also so over priced for the quality of food served. Go to Taco Bell and get a cravings deal.

Don't bring an expencive bike, there are so many thefts here I got a camara. Also, I asked that the security lights be looked at, and they never were. All but one is off on the sides of buildings.

About the only good thing here is matanance. They are quick to resolve any problems that come up and you put an order in for.

I wish I had listened to the other reviews on here before I signed my lease. I'm not a disgruntled 20 something, I'm 33 years old and know my value and what rights I have to live in a safe place. Considering the veiled threats from one roomate to stab me, I urge people who read these reviews to know what living at Craig is really like.

[Responce to "Owner"]
After I declined to have mediation and talked to my roomates, things still got worse.

Responce after this confrontation with them from RAs and any level of staff there was eather "We can't talk about your problems." Or "Because you live in the apartments those rules/support don't apply to you."

When I told the high ups about the therats, their responce was "We can't listen to your roomate problems. You need to solve it yourself." Nothing was mentioned about police or anything else. Once again their aditude was one where I got the feeling they were just not wanting to deal with it.

Finaly, "Owner", if you or anyone at Craig wanted to help, you would give your contact info like you do on the other responces. This still smacks of the aditude I get when in person, of staff just not wanting to deal with it, and passing it off.</Text>

If this has proven unsuccessful then we will schedule a mediation where an RA or Resident Services Manager will sit down and help facilitate a conversation to help come to an agreement.  Unfortunately when the roommates as a group decline a group meeting and only want to talk separately it is not possible for us to mediate.  We take threats of violence very seriously and never condone this type of behavior.  We will always work in conjunction with the Chico police department for these issues when the authorities are notified so we can be sure to always go through the proper legal channels in regards to reported threats.

My time here is terrible sooo far. Although I just moved here, people are rude. They are nice at first when you consider living there, then after you move in they don't care, because you are paying every month. They tell you when you move in "it's not loud it's a nice place to live" I have people next door to me blairing their music all day long while I'm trying to study. It's also located on the party street in the ghetto, and there are hookers walking around all night. My roommate is disgusting, and has several people over every night till 12-1am when I have morning classes. They do make you do a survey before you move in for a roommate telling you when you wake up, how late you stay up, etc. Let's just say my roommate has nothing in common with me. I have an AC that is terrible, squeaky all night and all day. I put in a request to fix it and they told me they won't fix it until it officially gets bad. It's hot and stuffy in here all the time, the community kitchen they have is always dirty and smells like rotten fish. The lock on the building to get into Abby never works and several people get locked out every night and you have to bang on the door to get in. Ever sense I've moved in 3 weeks have gone by and everything just keep breaking.
Also when I go to get my mail they won't give it to me because they are busy, and continue to change the hours to where you never can get your mail. I live here because this was a cheap place to live, the room they showed us was amazing, but it's not what you expect when you move in. Don't get the renovated room either they charge extra and it is honestly no different. I would not recommend living here. The only good thing about here is the food. Btw they make their employees put good reviews on here😊<//text>

Was attacked by this dumb girl in the hall last night, and she works for Craig as a "hall monitor" the owner of Craig hall is refusing to acknowledge that I was hit and kicked me out of his office when I asked "do you think it is ok for Somone to become violent at the place of work?" WORD FOR WORD.. I was immidatly asked to leave. My lawyer will be contacting them today or tomorrow they had an opportunity to make things better...<//Review>

We are always looking to improve our community and our resident's experience so this is great feedback to work with.\nBest Regards,\n\nCraig Student Living"}</Response><text>On the whole, almost a whole school year here, Craig is ALRIGHT. Basically, if you come here as a freshman, just know that you're going to be overpaying by A LOT. I pay nearly 1000 a month for a single room and the best meal plan. The food gets pretty old fast, but I mean it's not uneatable. Get used to cheeseburgers and quesadillas (you'll get the meme if you've ever lived here). Also, I think it's important to warn people that Craig has altered their policies midyear, and supposedly have the right to do so (in the lease, but I feel it's shaky ground). They changed the punishment for smoking weed on Craig property from 9 points (its a 10 point system, where once you've reached 10 points, you're kicked out and still responsible to pay the rest of your lease) to an immediate eviction (and yeah you'll still have to pay rent even after), and they've also blocked off a whole section of parking for their stupid shuttle. I paid $100 for parking, and usually I have to park across the street due to how many spaces they took away with that little trick. So they are a bit unfair and very much "Land-Lord-of-Young-Adults"ish.

Now that I've gotten through some of the less flattering features of CSL, I must say that you will definitely meet friends here. You will definitely always be fed. They have everything from condoms to Pringles in their little store, there's a Starbucks lite in one of the buildings, and most of the RAs I know are actually pretty cool and reasonable. Also the pool is open til midnight. If you're looking for a middle ground between living in the dorms and living in an apartment, this is it (economically, and freedoms-wise)< /text>< rating>

I would only recommend living here if you are a HUGE partier and want to meet lots of people. If you value your health, education, and materials I wouldn't live here. It is noisy, expensive, the food is horrible, the service is horrible. You are paying to be babysat. There are MANY rules. Don't live here!</Review>

COSTLY PLACE TO LIVE, Craig doesn't really provide the services they say they will, the a/c units never work; they say they do but they are temperature controlled and it will only make it 2 degrees cooler than it is outside, the food is disgusting and very expensive ($300-$400/ month for the flex plan), Craig takes out unreasonable charges on your deposit and they never told anyone in the beginning that we would be charged for carpet cleaning ($50), all Craig wants is your money and that's it. Sequoia Equities makes $2 million a year just off of CSL. This place is a joke and well understaffed. Leasing doesn't handle anything and they just refer you to someone else when there is a problem. This is also the most unprofessional business I've ever seen, I'm surprised nobody has sued CSL or Sequoia equities yet. This place is expensive and very small, the only reason they make business is because freshmen move here different places and they have nowhere else to live. Also even though you get your own room in the apartments, they are also smaller so it is almost as bad as the dorms and this proves that they are like a lot of other businesses where they give you just a good enough of a deal where you will not refuse their service. This place is really old, you might break stuff in your dorm and you have to fix it yourself so Craig won't charge you for it.</Text>

<text>To the Craig Student Living Building Manager

Contact Reason:	Complaint

How Would You Like Us To Respond?	Email

Message:	To whom this may concern,  I am residing in Craig hall. I'm contacting you officially on the grounds of an unsafe resident's environment in the room. I'm disappointed on how you staff approached the following issues: 1. (Most important) On September 8th at 7:30am, the room directly above ours sustained a broken water or waste pipe, thus leaking directly below into our desk, bed, and bathroom living areas. Upon arriving back to the residents after school at 7:00pm, my laptop, cloths, legal documentation, bed, floor, and entertainment system all were dirty brown and procest an ungodly smell. I understand this may be caused by a issue out of your hands, but responsibility to be taken. I mean this by what follows. Your staff put two fans in our room and called it good. Mold is developing under the carpets and in the ceiling and the ceiling is sagging in the hallway. This is NOT a safe living environment period. The mold is growing and can lead to health and building issue down the road. 2. Broken AC in triple digit weather. I understand your staff is busy, but to not fix the problem and said it is fixed is straight up lying. After two work orders, the AC is not producing cool air and makes living in the room unbearable. Other dorms at CSL don t have this problem. I contact the maintenance crew to get a report log on the visit. Their actions included to clean the coils once. What did that accomplished? Why say it is ok when it is not? 3. Full sized cockroaches in shower, bed, floor, and microwave. This room needs pest control. This is absolutely disgusting and unsanitary. 4. Shower head issue. I would like to first address this issue to you to see if we can come to an agreement. I personally advise you to make a trip to our dorm and investigate further.< /text><Rate>1< /Rate><user_name>Chandler Grant</user_name>< Pics>

<Review>Craig Student Living is a place where memories happen, and what wonderful memories they were. I was skeptical going to Craig Student Living at first for many reasons; whether it be bad reviews, or just the original orientation. At first, I didn’t like this place, I didn’t like it because of my preconceived ideas that it was going to be terrible. Little did I know, I was going to have some of the best memories of my life here. It really is the people who live here that make Craig an experience. The rooms are nice, and you can bring fish! Mine’s name is Stains! A lot of the staff is really nice—whether it be in the billing office talking payments with Kindra, or updating the RA Advisor, Trevor, on the latest problem in my life. Leasing was especially nice, I loved how Justine was always willing to help any resident she’d come across. It was almost ironic, because to be frank, the RA’s I didn’t see much of throughout the year. I hope the RA’s get a stricter code of conduct when it comes to helping residents. Often times, I feel more comfortable going to Trevor, than any of the RA’s. There honestly should be a required orientation to learn about every current RA that year. It feels a little discouraging when you don’t know over half of the RA’s and yet you are supposed to talk to them when in need. My RA, Lauren, left a bitter taste in my mouth the one of the first times I talked to her, but it was not her fault. She is a nice lady, and I have a lot of respect for her. The situation was simple; my concern got shot down at the mandatory meeting due to keeping Craig look good. She mentioned that they are not responsible for any stolen property, and to lock the door to your room. I however, casually inquired in front of everyone what if they pick the locks? Well, she said “you can’t break into them.” I never let that go since I have seen countless residents break into their friend’s rooms with merely a flex card. Craig has to stop training their employees to make this place look better than it is, honesty is the best policy. Please do not give us the roommate survey if you are going to pick us at random, I got paired with a completely opposite personality. The food is rather okay. I will not dock Craig points for something they cannot help considering the food is made by a separate company. Overall, I had a blast living at Craig Student Living, it is the perfect place for incoming Freshman at Butte College and Chico State students alike. I have confidence that this place will be a good living environment to the majority of the population next year.<//Review>< username>

So far my experience at Craig has been crazy. The food has been okay but it is not worth the money we are paying for it. I will not lie I have made the best friends I will ever have there at craig. I want to give a special thanks and if you are planning to move in next semester into Craig to request the Bradley building and first floor if possible because they have the best RA ever known and her name is Coree.A little something you guys should know I live  in the Abbey building but there is no spirit there like Bradley building and I am able to go to Coree with anything . I am able to talk to her about all the problems I have and also not only that I now see Coree as a friend and someone who seems to care. Even though I am not  a resident in her building I spend mostly the whole 24 hours over there and she treats me like her resident and nothing else. She is always making me laugh and is very positive about a lot of things. She is the best !</text>

RA Coree is the best RA I have ever had, and it takes a lot to beat the Star Chart from last year.   Her door is always open if you need anything, she is probably the only reason I'm passing my Differential equations class! Not a great help with programming, but her math and people skills are off the charts! Coree is the only reason I came back to Craig, and we all know it's not the food or dryers. Like seriously... I can't get dry clothes here.... Even if I dry my clothes twice. But thankfully, Coree put up some incredibly useful tips on how to keep my whites white and colors colored. Coree even offered to vacuum my room for me, since I asked her so nicely. When the lightbulb in my closet went out last year, I went to see Coree, and she climbed up in my closet and changed it for me. She is honestly the nicest person I know who works here. She deserves a raise.<//text>

😡PARENTS BEWARE!!!!!😡

I am a parent of a freshman. Presently, I have had to deal with the mail system at Craigs Hall.  I sent an emergency package to my daughter that supposedly never arrived. After insisting the letter was found 6weeks later.

Again we have had trouble with mail delivery and this time it required a signature.  Craigs Hall denied receiving the delivery; stating UPS  FAILED TO DELIVER PACKAGE. Even though there was a tracking number that it was received and signed off by an employee.

It is unfortunate but Craigs Hall lacks professionalism and integrety. They have rude staff and i will not pay for my daughters living expenses to be yellled at or called a liar.

I by no means recommend this living quarter.

If i cant trust them with mail... what makes you think i can
Trust you with my daughter.< /Text>

It's definitely not an amazing place to live but compared to chico state's on campus dorms the rooms are so much bigger, you share a bathroom with 3 other people rather than a whole floor of students, and you don't have to check people in and out of your dorm after 7. The 2 biggest complaints I have is the food and the customer service. The food at craig hall is not horrible but it is not great. Compared to sutter hall on campus, the food is amazing. Sutter hall has the most disgusting food I have ever eaten. The variety of craig hall's food is what bothers me, They always seem to have the same stuff every week and only change it every once and a while. The customer service here is horrible, they always say they will do something if you have a problem but they never actually carry it out. If you have a problem here you have to be very persistent and bother them every day until they actually solve your problem. Other than those two things I do not have a problem with living here, on campus is not any better than craig hall, in my opinion craig hall is better.</Text>< Pics>

Worst place for a person to spend their college life. Horrible food and bad customer service. Keep your receipts because they will try to rob you. I wasn’t even able to put up with them for a full semester so I found a way out of that “prison cell”.</review>

I had a 10-month contract, so I couldn't help but lived there, but I felt it was a waste of money and time. It's definitely better to find or share a homestay than to live here.

Our leasing and office staff hare always here to help when the C-Store attendant has to make a stock run or resident lockout, and we put up a sign with an arrow to direct our guests over to leasing for assistance.  Each room has individual WiFi provided by Comcast Xfinity.  I see we haven't received a work order from you, and thankfully there is no reason to suffer! If your room internet is acting up please come in to submit a work order so we can get it up an running for you ASAP.  Although our leasing and other managers can offer assistance with general questions, when someone requests payment arrangements or has an important financial issue to discuss, we do need to leave those in the capable hands of our Manager in charge of bills.  Our dining hall has a wonderfully responsive management and staff and they love feedback.  They not only have feedback cards at the desk and next to the entrance, but they are also available to meet or talk at any time.  If you experience a meal that is not prepared properly please make sure to let them know so they can fix it for you, I can assure you they will make it right!

Finally found my place! She is so sweet and my hair feels like new. I have always had issues finding the right hairdresser because of my dry frizzy curly hair. She changed that! I can't wait to go back.</Review>

I have been going to Rosanna since before she opened Imana sky. I am contantly get compliments on my hair and my hair is naturally difficult at best. Thin and extremely difficult with a subpar hair cut. Rosanna knows what styles will work with my hair and always pushes my boundaries a little pushing me a little outside my conservative box and always to tons of compliments. And now that she’s got the salon the whole experience is exquisite from the beautiful pampered atmosphere to the wonderful staff.  She has gathered such a fun caring and talented group of people around her it is always such a joy and genuinely fun experience to come in that I always look forward too.<//review>

<Review>Worst haircut I have ever received. My mom who hardly ever cuts hair had to fix it for me. The barber missed one whole HALF of my hair so one side was long and the other was short. I showed photos multiple times of my OWN previous hair yet it was still cut way too short and different.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< Review>
Imana Sky Salon is a wonderful place to have your hair done. I have been going there since 2010 and my stylist is Rosana, the owner.  She has impressed me every time with her suggestions for hair colors, cuts and styles.  I have taken my kids there too who are both adults now.  You can’t go wrong!  I love Rosana but I would be comfortable with any stylist there.  Rosana does a fantastic job every time and the atmosphere is like being part of a family.  I can’t go anywhere else but Imana Sky Salon!!<//Review>

<text>Love Imana Sky!  I’ve been going for years and am always happy with my haircut and color.  They stay up to date on current trends, and always know what will look good on you. I’m a little biased to Rosanna since she’s the one who does my hair - she is such an upbeat, positive person and absolutely amazing with color and hairstyles.  I always get compliments on my hair thanks to Imana Sky!< /text>< pics>

<text>I absolutely love going to see Rosana at Imana Sky Salon. I tend to let my hair grown, maybe longer than I should, but she always gives me a cut that will grow out nicely until I come back and ask for a fun new transformation. Rosana kindly offers her advice, takes creative responsibility and has always sends me off with a cut I love. A few months ago I went out on a limb and had her take me from a brunette to a blonde and she did a beautiful job. I highly recommend Rosana, she's the best!<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Imana Salon in itself is an amazing salon... the decor is lovely, but, it’s the people that make you feel so welcome and at home.  Rosana, the owner and my miracle worker, is beyond words amazing.  A prior hairdresser had over-processed my hair resulting in dry, damaged, and breaking hair.  Rosana has brought my hair back to life... it’s actually growing again!  I’m so grateful to have found her.  After trying several people, she’s the only one who actually made a difference and has made my hair come back to life.  There’s only one person I trust with my hair, thank you Rosana!< /Review>

<Review>I was referred by a friend to Rosanna, the salon owner, and she did not disappoint! I have pretty long hair that had just become heavy and dull. I barely described what I was looking for and Rosanna caught on right away and did an amazing job. I left feeling like a supermodel and immediately got compliments from numerous people. No joke. I definitely will be recommending her to others and will be back for sure.< /Review>< pictures>

Where do I start?  I literally fly half way across the country to have Rosana cut my hair.  I have been a client for maybe 10 years.  The salon is clean and has this wonderful fun energy.  I always know I will leave with an exceptional hair style and  great service.  Make an appointment you won’t be disappointed.<//Text>

I have been going to Imana Sky for over 7 years now and have always had a great experience. Ron is a very talented and knowledgeable stylist and always gives me a great color, cut and style. He is also very flexible, patient and has a great sense of humor. 😉 I always look forward to spending a couple hours with him and always walk out happy!< /Text>

I have been going to Imana Sky Salon for years. Rosana is simply amazing. She intuitively knows what you are looking for and what would work for your style. Not only is she an amazing hairdresser, but she is an amazing human being. This is reflected in the salon: everyone is always positive, welcoming, and smiling.< /text>

<text>Imana Sky is a top choice for a hair salon. All the stylists are talented and easy to work with. Rosana has been cutting and coloring my hair for over 10 years. She is extremely skilled at cuts and is a master colorist. I can't recommend this salon enough!< /text><response>None< /response>< Date>

I have been going to Imana Salon for years and I've never been disappointed! They are professional, clean, friendly and highly talented all around! Love them all but have to especially say that Rosanna is AMAZING!!! I have recommended them to all of my neighbors and friends and will continue to do so!</Text>

I love Imana Sky.  I have been going there for almost 10 years.  I love Rosana, the Owner and all of her "girls" and Ron!  They are all professional, kind, talented, fun and make sure you know and feel like a million bucks when you leave.  They also offer a nice, clean, environment.</Review>

<Review>I have been going to Rosana for years and I'm always love it. Sometimes I go in and say I'm bored with my hair so do whatever you want. She always comes up with the best ideas that I can still wear professionally for work. I would highly recommend.</Review>< Pictures>

I love this salon! The Stylists are over the top friendly. Rosana,  the owner, is extremely knowledgeable about all types of hair treatments, coloring, and cuts! Every time I’ve been in, and it has been many times over the years, I have had nothing but professional treatment with warm and friendly people!<//Text>

I looked up the Salon on google.. I finally go on a Saturday ... I walked in @ 1:25 .. & the girl there said we are closed ... We close at 2.. She wasn't friendly at all.. Or neither did she ask if maybe I was interested in booking an appt for another day..she was very dismissive... That's just not how a business should treat new business... All I wanted was a simple trim.. Nothing elaborate or time consuming ...</Review>

I have been enjoying the benefits of this virtual office space for nearly a year. The updates and improvements are great and Zee is the best!  Great to have him part of our team.< /Review>

<Text>We used officeLOCALE as a location for a short film project. We found a gem - a classic office backdrop for our scene depicting an awkward job interview. Zee, the manager, was pretty dang accommodating and really helped to customize our experience as an independent film crew. Check out the photos from our production.< /Text>< Response>

This is the best business and I never write google reviews. Professional, funny, ONE STEP and good company to boot. Zee made it so that I found  the process enjoyable. The Fingerprinting process and Live.Scan were done quick.. He made it very pleasant and Zee even waited for me (for over 30 minutes) cause I couldn't find the place. I HIGHLY recommend Zee for all of your needs. Passport renewals, business cards, notary public, Live Scan and or Fingerprints. He/Zee does it all! Very happy and highly recommend this place.<//Review>

We were in need of a coworking office space due to quarantine and I stumbled upon this coworking space. So happy we did! It has been FANTASTIC! Lots of privacy and a very professional space (conference room). Suitable for professional client meetings and/ or interviews. Zee is wonderful - really great customer service and affordable member rates. We had a unique situation and Zee was very flexible in accommodating what we needed. Would HIGHLY recommend!< /Text>

We used office locale for a notary. My dad was unable to get out of the car to walk and the office locale staff came out to the car to help. This is a much better personalized service than ups store or fed ex. They also have Co-working space. It’s a boutique service. I recommend highly!<//Review>

<review>I’ve never heard of this location for printing, however I was sent here in order to get fingerprinted for a brokers license. As soon as I stepped in the door I was greeted with a pleasant smile. The owner is funny, bright, friendly, and extremely personable. If you need meeting spaces, fingerprinting done, full office with services, etc. I highly recommend Office Locale.<//review>< Response>

Amazing  concept for office work.   I opened my office box at this place and I save thousands of dollars in overhead expenses.   For a price of a mailbox I now have my own business with a live receptionist,   Conference rooms,  and all my printing and shipping needs taken care of with awesome  Customer Service,  a rare thing nowadays.  I  am not going  anywhere else to do all my printing and business.</review>

Great location, service and Zee is terrific!  Very convenient.

UPDATE:  Since Zee, the owner, moved to this new location - everything remains as before (sans the "locale").  Brilliant guy, funny but gets you results and great service.</text>

As an international business looking to expand globally the first step is a physical presence in the local country/environment you are targeting.

As a young professional in a digital freelance environment the requirement to segregate physical business presence from your home location is a necessity.

Office locale provides this and much more. Could not recommend more highly.< /review>

I needed a quiet place to study for the California bar exam and came across OfficeLOCALE when searching for office space.  It's quiet,  brightly light, well secured, there is plenty of parking, close restaurants for a quick bite to eat; pretty much anything you may possibly need to get focused and stay focused. Building access could be better, it's the only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars. But Zee, who's always friendly and professional, facilitates that as much as he can.

Although I don't personally use/need these, OfficeLOCALE also offers a variety of services that would be great for anyone trying to launch their start-up or small business. Would highly recommend OfficeLOCALE.</review>

<Text>My 26 year old Saturn broke down in Bellflower, CA, which is far from home. AAA sent a tow truck driver and I asked if there was any place nearby that he could recommend for service.  Right away he recommended Quick Auto Repair, and I am so happy he did. Finding parts for a car as old as mine can be a real challenge.  They diagnosed the problem with my manual transmission right away, but the part they needed to fix it was no longer available. But they didn't give up. It took three days, but they found the part somewhere and got me back on the road. It was magic!  Great work! They were friendly and the price was just right. Can't recommend them enough!<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

I'm very pleased with the service I received here at quick auto. My Camry needed some transmission work and from the get go the staff walked me through what was wrong with my car and what needed to be done. I did not feel intimidated or taken advantage of as I have with other auto body shops. Thank you quick auto!!<//text>

Quick Auto repair that's it the name says it all,
No matter what problem your vehicle might have they will fix it the right way, motors and trans, and they can tow your vehicle if needed 24 hours a day, I finally found a good repair shop I can trust<//Text>

<text>My daughter has a 2004 Ford Escape which needed the Alternator replaced. Moe replaced it with a lifetime guarantee. The alternator failed 2 more times. I read on the internet that these alternators are notorious for failing due to exposure to heat generated because their close proximity to the exhaust manifold, not to mention the difficulty of replacement. On the third repair Moe checked with Ford and found out that the alternator could only be replaced with a Ford Motor Craft  alternator which cost more. Moe replaced the alternator with the Ford Motor Craft part at no additional charge. Great customer service. Thank you Moe!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

No drive-thru and the parking lot is often busy. One of the smaller local Starbucks. The team is always very fast. Even though there are only a few tables inside, they do have a large patio area with many tables. Lastly, there always seem to be homeless/drifters around.</review>

<text>Unfortunately the Baristas working there couldn't answer questions, they were not even aware of a recall poster that was set up in front of the register. Customer service okay after all it is a Starbucks and the location is not the best. A little bit more training with the youngsters in there working the Starbucks and you might have a four-star coffee shop! The display of edibles were not very appetizing.</text>< user_id>

<Rate>2< /Rate><text>Surly, unfriendly service - mistakes on order... I’m a big Starbucks fan but this one needs work. Today I asked for a coffee cake and a mocha no whipped cream... received a cookie. Replaced with the right item. Mocha comes with whipped. Nicely notified the unsmiling staff... who then just use a spoon to get most of cream out. Asked for a new one - since I realllly don’t like cream. No apology given - they seemed put out that I asked them to fix their mistakes. Avoid this one.<//text>< pics>

Chai Latte's is never hot at this location and the foam is so much it should be charged as a small size.

and again doesn't taste right and if they paid more attention to making a good drink and not so worried about talking at the counter, they might make a descent coffee.< /review>

The food has usually been pretty good but we sat in the drive through for over 20 minutes without seeing more than 2 cars go. The inside looked filled so I wouldn't be confident they adhere to most Covid protocols. We left the line without being served, but rather hit up twice by a homeless guy at the drive through.<//text>

Got a double cheese burger and fries with a sprite. Kids got corn dogs and fries. Mom got a double cheese burger and our friend had the leos burger. Everything was good. Food didn't take too long. Everything was hot and fresh.</review>

<text>Been here many times from when I was a kid. Every time they have been courteous and served us as quick as they could. They won't serve you quickly as their food takes time to prepare, but it's most certainly worth it every time. From their steaks, to burgers, and burritos to hot wings, they're all good and leave you satsfied. Atmosphere is very chill with all booth type seating with a small outdoor area.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjNLBbO3FDhDB2COcw2qWBgL1UwfwjrJzVKzET=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHbn4A9nk8glBcd2MNSi3QYHBMjvBBoLZwzeFc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>First time here. Extensive menu for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. The pancakes were so good and so was the sausage. I want to go back for Lunch and try either a Gyro, Patty Melt or the Nachos. Like I said, they have a very diverse menu. This is going to be my new favorite place to go so I can try everything.
They also have indoor and patio dining and deliver with Doordash.</Review>< Pics>

The first time I went to Leo's the Philly Steak sandwich was excellent. However, I went again 2 days later, and the sandwiches were horrible. They were very soggy, as though they had been made some time ago, then just thrown into the box and given to me. Maybe it was made for someone else who never picked it up. I don't know, but it was definitely not made fresh! I won't return any time soon.<//review>

I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream. I was thinking a burrito wouldnt be too difficult to eat on the road. The menue said 750 but it was more than 10 bucks. Not only was it not easy to eat on the road it was impossible since they but it in a smartphone plate it had beens and cheesr all over the damb thing. N they gave me a flimsy plastic knife and fork. Never in 45 years have i ever gone thru drive thru someplace and gotten a wet bean and cheese burrito. In fact its the first time i had kne like this ever. Id suggest you make a butrrito like a burrito instead of some wierd thing like this. Perhaps keep it in side the torillia wrap it with paper and foil and make it so you dont have to sit down to eat i was so angry and messy that i vowed to never go back</review>

I have been coming here for years. If you want an amazing burger fresh off the grill Leo's is the spot. You have to try them. Also the Chicken salad is really good, and you can't go wrong with a club sandwich. Place is run by a great family, location is also very clean.<//Review>

The best breakfast burrito I ever had. Pancakes and french toast are good too. Drive thru takes forever, but it's worth wait. I recommend going in and placing your order.< /Review>

The food is good but they take a rediculous amount of time to get thru the line at drive thru.. like whatever you think is normal to get thru a long line and add 10 minutes.. and have them repeat the order back to you because the speaker is messed up.. be careful where you park you'll get boxed in cuz of the long drive thru line</text>

They always mess up my order or forgot something, and they are so rude when I go back to fix my order that they messed up. Takes like 15 mins to get a simple breakfast burrito. DO NOT RECOMMEND.<//Review>

The breakfast burrito(ham & 🥓, NO ⛔ sausage please!!) are good when we get the right order. That is the only problem I have, every time we go they give us the wrong order like 50% of the time I get my order how I ordered it.
Even if when I order I make it clear how I want it, they still mess up. That's why every time my husband & I  go we bet if we would get our order right 🤪
its OK because when we do get what we order the breakfast burrito are 💣 🤤< /Text>

Most delicious food. Mushrooms and zucchini my favorite in very large portions to share. Visit once a week. I have to  try the fish burger made like a hamburger with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles...looks appetizing. My fried has the fish burger everytime we visit.< /text>

A little pricey but the food is definitely worth the price! They're not stingy with their portion sizes. 10/10 will eat again 👌<//Review>

This place is always amazing.   The food is delicious,  the service is always great.  It's also a great value, as you get s TON of food.   I typically get the bacon cheeseburger,  though I ha e never had anything off the menu that I didnt love.  The onion rings are hand made, as are the zucchini fries.<//Review>

The food is always hot & fresh , the prices are a bit high. I ordered the buffalo wings dinner which was $15, but no longer comes with a drink!  You get a good portion of food, but seeing that the drive through is the only way to visit here. A courtesy to their customers could be free combo when you spend 25 to 30 dollars!< /review>

no star if possible, terrible service. stayed at the drive through speaker for almost 30 minutes. there was cars behind me and no cars ahead of me..so there wasn't any reason for the delay. ended up driving to the window to see if there was anyone available that I could talk to but they were all in there acting dumb. never going back.</Text>

<Review>They got really good breakfast burritos but every time I go, they never call out my order so I end up waiting 30 mins for my food. Their drive thru on weekends is also a nightmare, one time I waited 45 mins, that’s ridiculous, they need to hire more people and have better service if they want customers.</Review>< Response>

Don't get me wrong their food is very good but the last time that I went there are ordered the super burrito for breakfast and it barely had any meat in it. For the price that the burrito cost which was $10 and some change I should have had way more meat in the burrito instead of a burrito full of potatoes.<//review>

<text>I had to change my 5 star rating to a 1 star since customer service turned down my niece for a potentially $50+ order. Not to mention she had to walk over a mile to make this order possible. I have to cut ties with this store. My night got a lot better. Thank you Leo.< /text>< Pictures>

I had the Tbone steak and eggs. It was amazing. The steak was cooked right able to cut with the plastic fork since it's only to go for now. The rest of the plate had scrambled eggs hashbrowns and toast all cooked perfect.. boyfriend had the combination breakfast burrito which was good as well.< /Text>

<text>The support is always great that the gentlemen and ladies who cook and help have a smile on their faces. The food is that the normal diner food nice and fatty and reasonably priced.  My move to is certainly the chili chips you want to try out the chili chips for dinner or lunch.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

My husband and I like going there usually after we get out of the bank across the street from you. When I ask for my fries to be extra crispy we generally do get that way. We also went there with my brother and his wife. I also like the Pork fajitas YUM! Please don't stop putting that on your menu. 😀< /Text>

I picked up dinner through the drive thru. I got a club sandwich combo, carne asada dinner plate, and a chicken salad. I waited in the drive through about 30 minutes. I got home and I had no dressing for my chicken salad, no salad at all with my asada dinner plate, and my fries were rubbary. They used to be great, but that wasn't tonight's experience.<//Review>

They have kids' meals, special burgers that are only found at Leo's, and one thing I love in particular: they always give you your cup filled with small pieces of ice just above halfway. I'm not going to lie, I do eat this ice when I'm finished because it is still full of the delicious flavor of my soda. In addition, their table service is great. An employee will bring your food to the table, but sometimes will have to return the the kitchen and come back if you order too much. However, this can be expected. They tell you to enjoy your meal, and then, of course, you can enjoy it! Overall, a wonderful restaurant with burgers, hot dogs, French fries, and more for anyone who is craving some amazing food.</review>< pics>

<Review>The burgers are great nice thick real bacon but and this is a big but 13 bucks for a combo is really overpriced for fast food Patty was just a frozen thin patty and to get a small soda with the combo was a let down. If it was a large soda would of gave it 4 stars but that's just penny pinching at its finest considering soda cost very little specially when half the cup is filled with ice I might of got 8oz of soda.<//Review>< name>

Wonderful place of Bakersfield! Haven't had a bad meal here. They bring your food on non disposable plates and cutlery. Breakfast, lunch or dinner is a good time for Leo's!!! Great salsa here!
When I pass through town, I look here to stop!!< /review>

We love Leosbecause they have good food at a good price.  It is always clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  There's both Ametican food like burgers and Mexican food.  You can get breakfast.  Servings are generous.< /Text>

We had 3 meals ordered. 2 pastrami sandwiches and a chicken sandwich in the drive thru. And we waited 30+ mins until we part of the food. They told us that the chicken sandwich was still not ready had to go around to the front door and wait for it because the people behind us their order was already ready. I don't think I will come back again. This place takes way too long just to get your food.< /review>

<Review>One of my favorite burger spots of all time. I’ve been coming here since late 2015 when I’m in Bakersfield or pass thru on the way back from LA. I usually order the double bacon burger combo while my friend prefers the mushroom burger. They also offer breakfast but it stops by 11am so I’ve never had the opportunity to try it. Everything is made fresh so expect to wait a while in the drive-thru if you don’t want to go inside. It’s usually a bit busy. Definitely worth the wait though! I originally found this place using Yelp with great reviews.<//Review>< Pictures>

I was recommended by a friend to come and try the burgers from this place. Burgers are HUGE AND DELICIOUS!! This place is kept very clean and I was surprised that is not only burgers. They have a lot of variety of foods, breakfast, tacos, tortas.. this place is awesome.. will be coming back to this place more often.< /review>

<Review>Awesome place to satisfy your fried food craving! Bomb fried zucchini, onion rings, fries and must try the pastrami sandwich! It was freaking bomb. Have also tried the Egg Burger and it was great as well, I mean if you're into that sort of stuff; burger with egg I mean. Lol but for real it was good but fave so far is the pastrami sandwich. I bet the pastrami burger would be a hit as well. Next time...<//Review></record>

<text>I LOVE the food there. Although recently if I wanted to add/take out something from an order they make a bigger deal than it should be. They go and ask other employees if that's possible, when they've done it before. Other than that the food is good and they have vegetarian options as well.</text>< rating>

Fairly inexpensive.  Busy during breakfast.  Food is okay.  Service is great and efficient.  You walk in, order, pay, receive your number, get your drinks, sit down and they bring it to you.  A person walks around refilling coffee.  Breakfast is served Mon-Fri until noon., 1PM on the weekends.<//review>

<Text>I wish I could give this place 10☆....  The food quality here is Phenomenal.  If you don't come here and experience the fresh, cooked to order food here........  Well, it's a shame. I've only been here 2xs but this has become my favorite choice in Bakersfield so far. I've only lived here for 2 months. Awesome job Leo's......   👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Still good came out hot, fast and staff were all super friendly. Only gave three stars because its alot of fried food and nothing stood out.

Get the Hot Pastrami or the Pastrami Burger combo meal! Their food is delicious. All of it. Never been disappointed by them. Their workers are friendly and always seem to have a smile on their face. Their establishment is very clean even though it is an older establishment. My family loves Leo’s and often get their taquitos and burgers... not sure why the mixture of the too. Oh!!! And they’ve got the good ice for your drinks.<//Text>

The drive thru took forever, but I was already warned about that so I didn't mind. But they got my order wrong and didnt give me my drink, and I didnt realize either until I'd already gotten home. The fries were alright, good but nothing special, and the onion rings tasted old and soggy. And it wasnt particularly cheap for this subpar meal either. The only good thing I have to say is that the buffalo chicken wings were pretty decent, but because of everything else I probably wont be going again. There are plenty of other locally owned burger and fry type restaurants I'd much rather go to than Leo's.< /Review>

The pastrami sandwich and gyro sandwich are very good . Zucchini fries are awesome.
I was disappointed with the burger but everything else I've tried was good.

<Review>I really wanted some biscuits and gravy one morning and i read good reviews about Leo's on Yelp. Went by on a Friday morning around 9 AM. There were only 3 cars in the drive thru and it took at least 30 minutes for me to get my food. I got home, took one bite and looked down in shock. Everything looked OK but OMG was that gravy FOUL. It was probably the nastiest thing I've ever eaten. Makes me want to stay away from gravy forever! The eggs and bacon was good but I couldn't even stomach the pieces of it that had even TOUCHED THAT NASTY GRAVY! It had to have been rotten for it to actually taste that bad! I spent $9.48 (DIDN'T EVEN GET A DRINK) on the worst meal ever. I'm sure they make a good burger and the girl up front was super sweet but DO NOT GET THAT GRAVY!!

The wait on the drive thru lane is ridiculous...check your order always missing something.  It's the 3rd time my daughter gets home and missing onion rings and/or French fries. The salad did not have dressing. They usually put it on the salad.</Text>

The food is good and fresh and service is always friendly. Love coming here for breakfast,  I just wouldn't recommend using the drive thru because wait times are much longer waiting in the car than going inside to eat.</text>

This is The Bakersfield Default Burger Spot (PERIOD). I've been living in Bakersfield for more than 20 years and have eaten at Leo's a million and a half times. I would file this 'Burger Joint' under a menu that "Has Everything" from Patty Melts, Onion Rings, Salads and such, Pastrami and a Fish Sandwich & Fish 'N Chips (though don't quote me on them last two!).
Breakfast, yup got that too even with Burritos with egg & hashbrowns - They Got You Brother.
Due to it's location, it's a no Brainer. And just because there is a new McDonald's across Ming, right across the street from 'Honey Baked Ham's... btw good sammishes there too... just forget about Mickey Fickey D's and just go to Leo's just east and right before (Old!!!) Stein(SP?) Road. Got that?<//Text>

Drive thru take a very long time. Food lacks fresh ingredients and some have a freezer burn taste.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80ea41dc223b0073:0xbf4f59bfa4a34076</Gmap_id><rating>1</rating>< Pictures>

Always fantastic. I come here often for their Ruby's nachos and the carne asada quesadilla. All the portions are enormous and very well priced. This place is always busy but never so packed that it's annoying. The staff is friendly and the inside is always very clean. Their booths are big and comfortable so it's good to come with a group. One of my favorite local places hands-down.<//Review>

I doubt we'll ever go back here again not to mention the high price for mediocre food but the taste wasn't all that good either. I ordered a patty melt and it came with lettuce and tomatoes instead of grilled onions like where they do that at 🤔😂< /text>

When We asked about the price they began to argue with us and told us the drink we upgraded to cost more than It did. Then told us that's just how the system works, to not pay the upgrade fee but to pay the full price of the combo including the drink which is worth $2.90
And the full price of the drink you're upgrading to we changed our drinks back to the regular sodas since we paid to for them. We got almost $6 back from our drink upgrades.
Bad coustmer survices, long wait time all for some okay food. No thanks we won't be back.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>
