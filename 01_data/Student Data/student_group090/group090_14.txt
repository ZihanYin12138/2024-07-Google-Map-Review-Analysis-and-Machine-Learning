Two Rivers RV Park

✅ On the way to Yosemite always midway stop to park our RV on the San Joaquin river

✅ Excellent riverside location for a family picnic. Grilling fish is my fave

✅ Near great bass pro shop

✅ Swim in river to end or start the day

✅ New management, turnaround professionally ran, lots of upgrades in progress and pride is obvious.
Safe, very clean especially bathrooms, very reasonably priced

——

We’ve been coming in Two Rivers RV camp for many many years now both with our extended family and at times when I need a place for alone time to just camp, fish, swim, and relax. I love the setting, right on the San Joaquin River. My family and I have not had any issues with the people we’ve met there and I made friends with some of the permanent guests which is probably one of the big reasons we return a couple of times a year. Fishing is my thing, the river is perfect for that and a well stocked pro shop is nearby.

I’m very pleasantly surprised with the changes I’ve seen during my last trip, the parks  under new management and the change is like night and day, Things have been cleaned up, lots of painting going on, freshening up of the facilities, and the bathrooms have been attended to nicely.  I’ve always felt safe here so that’s never been an issue but it’s clear that this is now a very well-maintained location, safe for the family, and the perfect getaway location. If you’re heading to Yosemite or nearby Manteca, definitely consider a stay here. Very reasonably priced compared to other parks in the state.< /Text>

It's a cool place. Priced at 30 bucks a night (you only get a water hookup) it's a good deal. We were right on the water staff was friendly and it was a good place to stay. We will most definitely be going back soon< /text>

The view is beautiful. I love the manager she don’t take no bs. Zero tolerance for negative people. She looks after the campers and makes sure we’re safe. She’s up before the sun making sure everything is good. Marcella the managers helper  is so sweet. She helps the manager keep the bathrooms and grounds extremely well also. These ladies work hard to make it a clean safe positive environment. The stay is very relaxing. Some of the campers are very helpful. Others not so much. The owner is a rude and doesn’t pay his employee’s well. Don’t make any friends with the permanent tenants they are full of drama. Otherwise I enjoyed the nature, sunrises and sunsets.<//text>

So quiet! It's nice.  New owners (from what I hear) and new superb management.  It is being cleaned up nice, new paint on/in bathroom, clean showers and bathrooms, trees being trimmed, and trash disposed of properly.  We are waiting on next open spot to rent RV Park spot, exciting😊🌄😁  Violators being monitored and dealt with accordingly. I believe no visitors at moment due to COVID. SO STAY TUNED!! Only getting better. Kudos to new team at Two Rivers! Looking Awesome 😎<//Text>

The new Manager Connie could not of done a better job! Her manner, expertise, knowledge of the park was amazing compared to the prior Manager. She was very kind and informative, the park was cleaner than I have ever seen it. I was going to stop coming as it was getting to look so bad and we thought we would come one more time and was surprised to see how it has changed and will definitely be coming back in the future.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809047de142a440f:0x481f2f22bce81ebb<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The good... Close by and not hard to find. Decent shore and large shallow area for the kids. You can spot your shade right by the water.  The bad.. it's not much on looks, looks more like a wrecking yard than a park. Too many resident vehicles on blocks. Port a potty was bad and reeked. Way too crowded for pandemic. Guy on a motorcycle in the sand by the shore.
Not very clean.
For $15 a vehicle ( I counted over 50 cars today ) it should be maintained better.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

< review>
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Im not a glam camper, I like my camping Raw. Most places are too civilized. This is the last of decent camping in this area. I love it here. Its what you make of it. Fishing is great. Swimming and Sunning by the river is fun and there's a Boat launch if ya need it.Open your mind forget what you know and find your space out at 2 Rivers. Coming back 3 yrs later I have noticed that under new management, I feel safer. Now instead of the feeling that there are people up in my business, I feel like there are friends that got my back.<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>The worst place for camping. I feel forced to describe how horrible was camping there for others families to know. We planed to camp for 2 nights but we were forced to camp one only. There aren’t regulations in the park for quiet time. So, other people camping is getting drunk, screaming , kids running around your tent, very loud music is the worst. All this happened around 12 am to 4 am or when whenever they want to stop. I asked them to please low volume to the music but they didn’t. I am talking about 4 big groups camping separated, doing the same thing. Most of the campers are Latinos with big families and kids, By the way, I am Latina. But not the type of the most people camping there. Also the main restrooms, are very dirty, my 9 years old daughter was  crying of going there. no toilet paper, soap. They also have portable restrooms closer, but they are full of stool, people poo outside the toilet, the worst is that there are flies, lots of flies because of the human poop all around the rv Park, this flies don’t let you eat because they are ready to step in your food. Also showers, there is one that is better to think that doesn’t exist because it is inside the restrooms. I hope my review help you. I gave one star because I can’t give zero.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x809047de142a440f:0x481f2f22bce81ebb<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The river is nice to look at but the "campsites" are some picnic tables in a dusty field with a couple of porta potties. There is so much trash everywhere that I wouldn't let my toddler get out of our camper van. Save your $25 and camp out in the Walmart parking lot.<//Review>

<Review>River part is nice. Water is low so kids can swim and play in the sand. The RV park is poorly taken care of. They charge for day use, as well as overnight stay, but they don't keep up with the maintenance of the place. There are no trash cans and the porta potties are some of the grossest restrooms I've ever seen- horribly disgusting!<//Review>< Pictures>

I like this place because of camping. But Please be very carefull with the current of the water. It is very strong and cant easily take a child.</Text>

<Text>Traveling on the big truck across the country, coming in to Cali, a river you can actually swim in safely, was a top priority for me. Used to the Sac or Trinity rivers. This lovely spot we found by chance . They allowed us to park right on the bank, offered a movie evening ( projected on side of the house) bug spray, super friendly , helpful and professional couple in charge. Beautiful space,  only thing was the porta potties could’ve used some love, but I’ve definitely seen worse! Will return ASAP!</Text><username>Lyn Hostettler</username><pictures>None<//pictures>< GmapID>

<review>Very fun. Except I did call search and rescue for my kids.(they where all ok) but the staff did not help at all they where like uhhh whhaaat can you repeat that ohhhhh I don't have keys for levy I can't help. I'm in pure panic paying people that where visiters and more helpful to help and on call with 911 while the freaking staff that you pay them to visit there area of the river and they could not help. Makes no sense. They should post that we will take your money to stay on our land but in a emergency we will be no help. Thank you to the visiters there that day that did help.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>So first off I want to say the staff are very friendly, my problem is not with them personally. Nor with the site's. If you want to be loud and obnoxious and not care about other campers this is the place for you. They seem to  allow loud music all times of night and will allow people to come and go all night long. They seem to not have a time that they stop campers from setting up shop. I think 3 a.m an rv decided to come in a set up shop and be loud AF. To the full time RV residence I'm not sure how they put up with it.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x809047de142a440f:0x481f2f22bce81ebb</gmapID></record>

MOSQUITO HEAVEN! Man, we all got attacked, all day and night, by mosquitos. These suckers bit through our clothes, that were sprayed with deet. Some bites are part of camping but this was an infestation, and management KNOWS it’s bad. OTHER THAN THAT it was a great, quiet and clean place. We had RV hookup, water was nearby for kids to swim and play. Overall a descent place and super sweet management.< /text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>This place is sort of off the beaten track, but it is right on the San Joaquin River. It was really beautiful when we were there. It was quiet and there was a space available when other places were booked. We enjoyed it. It's really more like a trailer park that allows RV's.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I just bought a new RV and wanted to Camp local. The first time I went camping there the campsite host met us at the gate and collected money for three night stay and I told her we may stay at 4th night. The third day she comes running up right when I open my door at 7:30 in the morning saying we need to pay her for the next night. I told her I thought we already paid for three nights let me talk to my wife come back in an hour. Exactly one hour later she was knocking on our door. My wife told her that we had paid for three nights and we are not going to stay a fourth night and she argued with us for about 15 minutes and then when I told her I gave her the $100 bill and how much chain she gave me back she finally remembered. Then the second time we went there I brought my camper again and it was a holiday weekend so I got there Thursday night and my wife stayed home to go to work on Friday. So Friday my wife comes after work to drop off some groceries and beer in the lady tells her that she needs to pay a day use fee to be able to drop me off food if she's going to stay more than 5 minutes. So to avoid 2 days of overnight fees because she met me there I had to unhitch my truck from my trailer driving to town drop the car off at my house and come back to the campsite to avoid that extra $40 fee. The place was so much better when they didn't have this campsite host running it. I would give it to 0 Stars if I could.< /Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>(Translated by Google) Very nice place, and being there I knew that you do not need to reserve to camp, because they ask you if you only go for the day or are you going to stay camping, they charge you $ 20 for the day what I did not like very much is that there are only 2 bathrooms And there were many people waiting that was what bothered me, the river is very beautiful and the water is not cold like in other places, they passed supervising that everything was in order, and the most fun we caught 4 fish !!

Muy bonito lugar, y estando allí supe que no necesitas reservar para acampar, porq te preguntan si solo bas por el dia o te vas a quedar a acampar, te cobran $20 por el día  lo que no me gusto mucho es que solo 2 baños hay y había muchas personas esperando eso fue lo que me incomodo, el rio es muy bonito y el agua no es fría como en otros lados, pasaban supervisando que todo estuviera en orden, y lo más divertido agarramos 4 pescados!!<//review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) It is very dirty, a lot of flies, garbage everywhere, I don't think they are good to clean, and people do not collect their garbage at all.

If you want to have 5 🌟 services Maaco is the perfect place. Friendly, courtesy, efficient and amazing work. They keep you post it with what is going on with your car while,is in the shop. Always available on the phone when ever you call. At the end the work they did on my car it was amazing like nothing had  happen to my baby ( car ).<//text>

They are great! Very satisfying service and very knowledgeable they know what they are doing... a good tip.. Maaco stores are individually owned so they are not all the same. Thus i recommend the Fairfield branch.. they are great

I had a pretty bad scuff on my passenger side mirror, so I took my car to Maaco.  They were very helpful and accommodating.  They took care of my concern in no time at all and made sure I was comfortable while I waited.
I would highly recommend Maaco for your repair needs. Great customer service and work!<//Text>

<Text>I was a bit wary when looking at Maaco to paint the 2000 f-350 I purchased.  Maaco nationwide has very low reviews and lots of issues.  The Fairfield Maaco is an exception.  They had wonderful service and spent time fixing issues as they were sanding my truck down rather than just spraying over them, which a lesser business could do.
The attention to detail and service provided throughout the process was great as were the results.  I was worried about the paint between the bed and cab but they did a spectacular job getting the paint on.  The truck body and tailgate has a few dings as did the tailgate I brought them to paint.  It now looks new, minus the dings.  Which I didn't want fixed.

I purchased the Base/Clear coat that they offer so not the bottom tier but something that will hopefully last my truck as it may never fit into a garage.  Could not be happier with the results unless they started replacing the faded trim pieces that now look worn and dilapidated compared to the finish on the truck.  All at a low price compared to what a custom paint shop will charge.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeM_QojbbX0aa_CsMrgX-qu_wlMvycXlM6Ge7z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

Great service great work. One suggestion to any one that goes into the shop . know that they are a family owned operation . Each Maaco is different ownership. I say this because I went into another Maaco for a estimate and I got a horrid rushed vibe.  Jeff in Fairfield explained they were not connected at all with them and how the buss is franchise. Go to the Fairfield location they rock.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808515e08f5c5e79:0x54c95bb34c15299e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The customer service at this Maaco is outstanding. Geoff took care of me and my car. I was able to use aftermarket front and rear bumper to fix my damages and they did a very great job with the paint and repairs. They we're also good with communication. I called a couple times while the car was getting fixed and they completely updated me on the whole process. If I get into another accident or need a paint job Maaco Fairfield is the top of my go-to list. Once the car was finished, they also took the time to fully detail the car too which was a very big plus!<//Text>

In December of 2017 I had my car repainted. There was a few spots that the paint had come off a little (not their fault some of them were mine). So I took it back and it was covered by the warranty. After a week or so they call and say they aren’t comfortable with the color that they repainted the bumper with because it didn’t match up perfectly. So they repainted it again and still the same issue. Geoff spoke with me and said that the only way to get the color right would be to repaint the entire car. So they did, free of charge. As always when I got the car back it looked immaculate and was very well taken care of during the weeks that it spent with them. All of the employees there do an amazing job and I’m sure they were sick of my car by the time they were done but it looks absolutely beautiful!<//Text>< pictures>

I own a '99 Dodge Ram pick-up, quad cab 4x4 that's been in my family since it rolled off the lot. So theres some deep sentimental value and I'm very cautious about who I let work on it. This is a fantastic shop from from top to bottom and the experience was top notch from start to finish. Geoff is an expert at what he does and his staff and the shop owner are top notch. I never felt uncomfortable once throughout the process, as car repair/auto body shops typically can be. Geoff pretty much read my mind on how I wanted my truck to look in the end...and I couldn't be happier with the final product. They answered all my questions and even gave substantive unsolicited advice on how to care for the new paint job in perpetuity. Since I got my truck back in pristine shape I've literally been recommending this place to family and friends. Thank you guys for your hard work!

This place has great service asthe paint job i had done looked great. The only thing for me is why i have to paymore for a truck over a car. The bed is hollow so really there less work or the same. I mean it's a small truck not a full sized.  So all in all if you want to pay double the price for a truck, they are good.< /review>

<Review>Maaco in Fairfield is excellent. Derrick the owner was great I arrived an hour early at Maaco and I was going to wait in my car but Derrick was nice enough to let me in and take care of me. I was rear ended and Derrick and his team were very professional. Derrick took me step by step with what to expect, he informed me through out the process what was going on with my truck and he gave me a reasonable time frame for repairs to my truck. Jason/Jeff at the front are very professional and he remembered me from the last time I was there. Derrick and his team at Maaco have been great throughout this process. I am a loyal customer for years to come thanks to Derrick and his team. My father is a loyal customer and had recommended me to them and now I am. Thank you to Derrick and his team.</Review>< resp>

My 2 year old car was rear-ended a few weeks ago. I was led to Maaco by the other driver's insurance company. I have to admit, I was not initially happy about having no choice as to where to have my car repaired.
Walking in to Maaco and meeting Derek and his team cleared all my doubts.
Derek explained the process, and provided the initial estimate of repair via E-mail later the same day. The staff also took us to pick up a rental car. As promised, I had my car back the morning of the 3rd day. My car looked brand new! The repair was done very well and I couldn't be happier!</text>

They were so helpful and did a terrific job on my 2002 Mustang.  Only a week after getting the paint job I scratched the side pretty badly.  I went back and they gave me an awesome deal on repainting that whole panel.  I have given several of their cars to friends and would definitely use them again.<//text>

Dear consumers,
I have been to some of the best body ships in the business in the past  and I have never received such care and attention as I did from the owner Derrick, at the Maaco shop in Fairfield, CA.  I brought my 530i BMW into the shop to be painted and I received the car back never looking better, the paint job was the best in the business, I had it checked out so I confirmed it, and the costs were incredible for the quality and care that was done to my vehicle.  I am ecstatic. Thank you Derrick, Jeff and the rest of the team at Maaco. You guys are awesome!< /text>

My intent was to pay top dollar for a "Full Body Dismantle" Paint job on my Toyota Tundra 4 Door Pick up.  I just did not want a "Tape" paint job on my prized Truck.  When I finally came to my senses, but against, my wishes, I gave in, and took my truck to Macco.  It was the best thing I could have done!  I absolutely marveled at the quality of the job.  I went over the entire body trying to find a fault, or a single blemish.  I could not find any.  I then realized that I overlooked asking for a replacement rear window trim.  Derreck said he would order it, call me when it arrives, and that he would install it for only the cost of the trim and NOT charge me any labor to install it.   When I brought my Truck home, the neighbors  immediately noticed the high quality of the workmanship.  One of the neighbors came up to me and told me that a few days ago, he had walked all around my truck trying to find a fault somewhere, but he could not!   Overall, Derreck was awesome, Honest, and a pleasure to deal with.  I paid for a good paint job, and got better than that.  I got a TERRIFIC paint job!  My Special thanks to all of you at the Fairfield shop.  For some reason, the "Review Stars" are set at 3, and am not given the opportunity to give the 5 stars that I want to assign!  Sorry Derrick!  Editing my post will still not allow me to change the defaulted 3 stars!<//Text>

Derek was extremely rude to me when I went in to get a quote. I will never recommend anyone to go to the Fairfield maaco. Take your business to Vacaville maaco or some other body shop.< /Text>

<review>Working with Dr. Ehsan Ali has been a wonderful safe space for my personal health . Unlike most doctors, Dr . Ali always takes the time to make sure he hears what I have to say, and applies his knowledge to help assure me that my health will be taken care of. I would recommend him to anyone that is looking for a non-judgemental, caring, and empathetic doctor.< /review>< Pictures>

Got in and out and Dr Ali explained the whole process to me and told me his recommendations. He didn’t try to oversell anything to me and gave me very natural results. I will be definitely be coming back again for sure every time I’m in Los Angeles .<//text><date>1590536839434</date>< username>

<review>Back again to see Dr Ali. This time I got filler in my lips. I really like his technique. The results are great. It looks very natural and subtle. Not too fake looking . He’s a pro. It takes him maybe 10 minutes and he knows what he is doing. I only trust Dr Ali for all my cosmetic care and medical stuff!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I went to the Beverly Hills Concierge Doctor for a Cool Sculpting treatment (I had purchased a Living Social Coupon).

I was treated with great respect by everyone in the office. Dr. Ali came in and verified that I would be a good candidate, then started the treatment right away. It has only been a couple of weeks, but I feel like I am seeing a difference. I plan to go back for one more follow up treatment, and I will return to this office!

The office was clean, the location was perfect and the staff was professional and courteous. I think this helped kick start some healthier habits for me also.< /Review>

<review>As someone who has worked in the healthcare industry I was beyond impressed with Dr Ali. Before addressing my medical history he took time to get to know me personally as I was a new patient to the office. He addressed all of my questions and gave me his full attention. He went above and beyond by providing me with names of other physicians in the area since I am new to California. I was amazed at how much time he dedicated to my appointment. That is rare to find in this industry. This is a doctor who truly loves his profession and cares for people. I am so thankful to have found a doctor I can trust. Absolutely recommend!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Dr. Ali is an amazing doctor with a great professional staff! Even though I'm not a concierge member, the service I get every time I go for my appointment feels very concierge-- office is efficient and made my visit as smooth as possible. He has great bedside manners and gets straight to the point. Thanks to him I am healthier than ever. Thank you Dr Ali!<//review>

<Text>I had the vampire facial (platelet rich plasma micro needling) done here about a month ago and I noticed that my skin is more firm and tight which I love! I've had the vampire facial done twice (both from different places) about two years ago and I enjoyed it at Beverly Hills Concierge Doctor the most. My first experience (I'm not going to name the place) was very painful. My second experience at a very well known place in downtown LA wasn't too bad, but it was very pricey. I believe that Beverly Hills Concierge Doctor is still having a groupon deal right now which is so worth it! I highly recommend this place for their professionalism & price.< /Text><user>106455069677677217332<//user><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Dr Ali has been my primary care physician now for more than 3 years. He has consistently gone above and beyond the call of duty. When I first signed up for the concierge service I was amazed at Dr. Ali's responsiveness, thoroughness, and his overall bedside manner. Flash forward 3 years and his dedication has not wavered in the slightest. The man has a work ethic and a stamina that won't quit.  I don't know how the hell he does it (with a family no less). He's certainly earned his reputation as the best doctor in Los Angeles, and I could not be more grateful for his care.

When I tell friends about Dr. Ali or they notice how easy it is to communicate with him, I am met with skepticism. The biggest misconception is that it must be prohibitively expensive. I have saved money on visits to the doctor by signing up for the annual service. For anyone that is considering a new doctor or weighing whether the concierge service is worth it...you won't find a better physician anywhere. Dr. Ali is remarkably bright, compassionate, and dedicated to keeping you healthy. He listens, he's reliable, he's patient, he's effective. I could go on and on with superlatives. Thank you Dr. Ali for your hard work and continued care.< /review>

Everyone has been telling me that he was the best person in LA to get a vitamin drip from so I came to the office and I am so glad that I did! Before I came, I was feeling tired and lethargic. But after the vitamin drip, which only took about 25 minutes, I came back to life. It was like magic. Plus Dr. Ali and his nurses were super nice and welcoming. Highly recommended for anyone who needs a quick pick me up.</Review>< pictures>

I highly recommend this office, the customer service here is outstanding! I absolutely love Dr. Ali at the Beverly Hills Concierge, he is such a kind and genuine Doctor that truly cares for your health/well being. Most importantly he is so knowledgeable and has gone out of his way to accommodate and ensure my comfort which I feel is hard to come by. I feel like most Doctor's these days are in such a hurry to get you in and out that they fail to give people the time of day. This is definitely not the case here at the Beverly Hills Concierge. Thank you for being such an amazing Doctor Ehsan Ali!</Text>

<Text>Dr. Ehsan Ali is hands down the best primary care Doctor in LA. I was able to see him at short notice and he immediately took care of me. I was in lots of pain and he was able to make a difference. He’s very knowledgeable, has great bedside manner (so easy to talk to and he really listens to you, he even followed up with me to make sure I was doing well the next day), overall I’m very impressed and so happy I found him. Side note if you are looking for a Doctor in Beverly Hills you just found him.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Dr Ali is fantastic! I visited his office this morning for a procedure & I am already delighted with the results! He is super professional, friendly, & his calm demeanor puts you at ease so you know you are in good hands! He has a wonderful, clean office in central Beverly Hills and he also does house calls. I would highly recommend him to a friend, in fact I already have! I will be back again soon! Great Doctor!</Review>

I am so happy I found Dr. Ali and his concierge services! I've been going here for years. Dr. Ali is the nicest, most warm and inviting doctor I've ever went to. It's very evident how much he cares about his patients!! From late night house calls when sick to Vitamin IVs and cosmetic services like the vampire facial, he is my one-stop-shop for any and all of my medical needs. Thank you Dr. Ali!!!!</review>

<Review>I felt like I was the only patient he had. I walked in and immediately the staff started working with me. After just a few minutes, I was back in the room--and Dr. Ali was in right after. The entire visit was smooth, quick and painless. Dr. Ali listened to me(it was my first time there) and made me feel very comfortable. I will definitely recommend Dr. Ali and his team to anyone looking for a Doctor in the Beverly Hills area. Great visit.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bc076fdaf5e3:0x874e19b5ed3096ab<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr Ali is truly amazing. He was recommended to me by two different contacts of mine for at-home concierge visits. When my family and I were visiting Los Angeles, we contacted the doctors office for vitamin infusions. Dr. Ali himself payed us a visit at The Beverly Hills Hotel. He prescribed each of us an individualized vitamin bag. I woke up the following morning feeling hydrated and energized. I highly recommend Beverly Hills Concierge Doctor and those fabulous vitamin IVs.< /Text>

I came to see Dr. Ali after a recommendation for a bunch of friends who have come here for Botox and general medical visit .

I have to say I was very happy with the overall visit and the care and my results are great for the Botox that I got. I will definitely be coming back here in the future for all my Botox needs and will be referring all my friends.

I also like how the doctor himself is doing the Botox and not a nurse. He also makes home visits.</Review>

Heard about Dr Ali from a few friends and nothing but good things. So I decided to make the trek out all the way from downtown Los Angeles. Parking was way easier than I thought . I was running late but still got in to be seen right away. They were so nice and accommodating. Usually I expect to wait for at least an hour at a doctors office but here I walked in, signed in, did my paperwork and got taken in right away. The office itself is so beautiful. Like a boutique spa. Dr Ali is very pleasant and friendly. Calmed my nerves. I usually get nervous at the doctors. I like how he is a primary care doctor and also he provides a lot of cosmetic medical services too, like Botox and juvederm fillers. One stop shop. It was great.< /review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Hi all, so I’ve been looking for a doctor that I could stick with for a long time and sadly to say Dr. Ali was unprofessional and barely took his time with me. During our appointment he stepped out for a “phone call” and he did not seem like he cared about about my health concerns whatsoever. Instead of taking the time to diagnose me he just put me on medications. I was literally only in his office for about 10 mins, I’ve never been to a doctor who just simply doesn’t care about you and I’m super disappointed. I would never recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I have never had this experience before but it was the worst I’be ever had at this office. I love Dr. Ali, he is a amazing doctor. But his staff truly dropped the ball on a very important issue I had going on and cost me money and time which makes me feel honestly a lack of care at this office for patients. I was dealing with some health issues. I come see the doctor and I come with blood work needed from my Lupus doctor. (So you all understand I am dealing with a illness that can kill you.) So it’s serious. The doctor says he can do my blood from my lupus doctor as well. I also needed some very important paperwork filled out too. So after a 7 days passes by I call back the following Tuesday to follow up on my paperwork. Not done yet. So now I get to my appointment with my lupus doctor 2 1/2 weeks after the initial appointment. My lupus doctor needs the blood work. It takes 2 hours to get this process done. And I don’t understand why I’m the one solving this problem between the two office. I am the one in need! All for them to send the bloodwork and it does not include my lupus information which I called and SAID PLEASE MAKE SURE IT INCLUDES THE LUPUS BLOOD WORK.  That is  of this whole damn doctors appointment I’m at now. My specialty doctor tell me this specific blood work he can only put the numbers in for it. WHY WOULD DR. ALI’s office not tell me this? Or why would Dr. Ali think he can do this? So now I’m at the rheumatologist paid my co-pay with no answers as to what the hell is going on with me because the main reason for this appointment was to get this blood work back so I can find out my issues. I do feel as a patient was NOT taken care of properly and my benefits and insurance was abused. Money wasted cause I had to pay a co-pay. And time wasted. I had a whole day of stuff I had to do and it was shot and I still have no answers.  Most importantly this is about the fact that I am a patient coming to find out about my illness and it was treated like I didn’t matter.< /review>< username>

I could not be any more happier with my experience at Beverly Hills Concierge Doctor. Intrigued with the IV drip of a fluid that contains numerous electrolytes and vitamins, which they call
the “Myers Cocktail” I booked my first appointment with Dr. Ali.

Upon arrival I was amazed at the service, cleanliness and energetic staff. The office is beautifully decorated and fully accommodating. After getting checked in I waited no more than 5 minutes before Dr. Ali came out to the lobby, greeted me, and took me back to the procedure room.

Dr. Ali was exceptionally kind, informative and he made sure I felt at home and at ease before getting me all settled in for the IV drip. Dr. Ali explained everything I needed to know about the IV drip and explained how everything would work step by step. Never once did I feel anxious or rushed.

The IV drip was a short 15-25 minute process. No pain, no nerves, no discomfort. I had the procedure done in the morning and by the late afternoon I realized it was working it magic. Instead of needing a second cup of coffee around 5:00PM, I was still energetic and focused. I definitely felt more energetic and alert than I normally would have at that time of day.

Being a first time patient, I loved my experience with Dr. Ali and the Beverly Hill concierge Doctor. I would recommend this place to anyone and would recommend the IV drip to anyone wanting to boost their immunity, cure a hangover, to de-stress, overcome jet lag, or simply add energy and a glow to their life.<//Text>

Dr. Ali is wonderful! Such a warm and charming man, so you feel completely at ease in his office. The entire staff was courteous and pleasant. During my procedure, Dr. Ali was patient and gentle, and was well-educated/informative during the entire process. Will definitely recommend to friends, and will return to see him again for future procedures!</review>

There are so many options in LA to choose from, but Dr. Ali should definitely be your goto!  He had a light touch and did a phenomenal job with my PRP facial.  I was very pleased and it was obvious that he cared about my well being, making sure that I was comfortable throughout.  I can't wait to go back for my next appointment!< /Text>

Dr. Ali is the best!!!  I got extremely sick and I could even leave my house.  I called Doctor Ali and he came right over.  No point on wasting your time at an office and waiting hours.  He saw me while I was laying in bed.  He helped me with my situation and I was back to normal in no time. Why waste your time in a physicians office waiting for hours in a waiting room?
And let’s not forget the extreme privacy he offers.  No wonder all the celebrities see him. I can’t thank him enough!!!< /review>

I have been a Patient of Dr Ali since 2014 and I have never been more satisfied with a Doctor.  Dr. Ali is a Physician but his office offers a concierge (Dr. Ali also makes house calls)  Dr. Ali is extremely professional,  polite, and a one of kind Dr. That will get you in same day appointments too.  Waiting has always been less than 10 minutes too.</Review>

Dr. Ali is the best concierge doctor in town! Very quick with response. He has been treating me for about a year now and couldn't be any happier. I recently got kidney stones and his house call IV really helped! Great bedside manner and professional staff. I highly recommend Dr. Ali!< /Text>

I had been dealing with an awful cough that was not improving, and had been told by a couple doctors it was just a flu I had to deal with and have it run its course. I was not satisfied so I called Dr. Ali's office and was able to get an appointment that same morning. He was very professional and explained a few different treatment options, which ended up helping me a lot and I was feeling better later that same day. I would not hesitate to return in the future and definitely recommend him.< /text>

<Review>Dr. Ali is the man.  This morning I text him for an appointment and I was able to swing by at 11am with no wait.  He is super accessible and more importantly, he is part of the new generation of forward-thinking medical professionals.  It's important for me to know that my doctor is on the cutting edge of medicine and research.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I found Dr. Ali online, it was around midnight when I called and was able to make an appointment within the next hour.

Dr. Ali himself eas very nice and easy to talk to. He spent about an hour going over all my problems.

His demeanor is very easy going. I would easily review him as the best doctor experience I had.</Text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Ali for over a year and have been overall pleased with my experiences at his office. Though during my last visit, a yearly check-up, I did not have my blood pressure taken, my heartbeat listened to, my reflexes checked, my weight/height taken, or any of the typical procedures. I am not sure if there was confusion with the purpose of my visit, but I was disappointed in the service. This visit also felt a bit rushed as I went through my list of things to go over I heard myself repeating, 'Wait, I have one more question' as the doctor attempted to leave the room.

Overall, I will continue to see Dr. Ali, but I do hope my next visit is treated with more consideration and thoroughness.</review>

Needed to see a doctor for an urgent problem. Found Dr. Ali from a google search. Decided to give his office a call and got a same day appointment. I did not know what to expect. I have not had good experiences with doctors in the past,  I was pleasantly surprised that he ended up being someone that I could easily communicate with and he understood what I was saying. Luckily I don't have to go to the doctor a lot, but if I need to see one I will be going back to Dr. Ali. Thanks for taking care of me doc!<//Text>

Dr Ali is one of the best doctors I have ever been to.  He has a vitamin IV drip that does wonders for when you're stressed out, sick or hung over.  STRONGLY recommend!!!!  Plus he does Botox.  Sent a few friends to him for that and they keep going back and look better than ever.</Text>

Dr. Ali took such good care of me today.
I'm always traveling and wouldn't be able to feel so great if I didn't stop in to see him in between trips. Today I came in for a vitamin drip and it gave me the energy and color I need to get through my week. There are many places in LA you can get an iv, but I chose to come to Dr. Ali for many reasons. He's super funny and easygoing and has a lot of other services too. They do everything here.. I def want to come back and get Juvéderm! We talked about keeping it super natural- I love that he doesn't try to upsell me a bunch of stuff. It makes me relax knowing he won't make me look crazy. I left today feeling so healthy and excited to come back.<//text>

Dr. Ali is amazing. The IV drip saved my life after a rough weekend out. I literally felt 100x better. Good bye hangover. My friend also had the Botox treatment done. She looks 10 years younger. :p</Review>

I love coming to see Dr Ali, he is more like a friend than a doctor. Always so polite and friendly. Always squeezes me in when I need to be seen. I love getting my Botox and vitamin drips / Iv’s. He even makes housecalls when I need him. He has always been there for me. His office is immaculate. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great primary care doctor in Beverly Hills!</text>

<review>I had the perfect visit at this doctors office. I called and was offered same day appointment, even though I couldnt come in until 10 pm, they still accomodated me. When I showed up, I was seen immediately, without waiting. The whole visit was seamless and very pleasant and Dr. Ali is so thorough and friendly.</review></record>

<Review>This Doctors office here is truly awesome. I love the level of communication and ease of booking an appointment. Unlike almost all other larger offices where it seems like a chore for reception to book out the onslaught of overworked Doctors who have only 20 mins to see each patient, this office is very hands on and responsive. I am very pleased with the Doctor's kind and gentle demeanor and always feel relaxed in the office. I highly recommend the IV therapy treatment and can say Dr.Ali also knows his way around a syringe of Botox if you're looking for a little lift in your life... and your face - this si the place!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_name>

<Review>I went to 2 different locations before coming here. I hands down give this location a 5 star! Aliyah went above and beyond to help us. Best customer service from all t-mobile locations. I have to drive further out but it was well worth it. If you are not satisfied with the service you are getting at your local t-mobile store, I highly recommend you come to this location.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Name>

I purchased a prepaid device and plan from this T-Mobile location and it has turned into a HUGE headache. The staff is so poorly trained in T-Mobile operations I can't comprehend how they are allowed to take customers cash.

When I purchased the prepaid plan and asked about a receipt I was informed I would be emailed a receipt. I was never emailed a receipt. I have received no account information besides the phone number that was assigned to the device.

Before I purchased the device I was told by the three store employees who were present I had 30 days to return it (this is wrong, T-Mobile's policy is 14 days). The device didn't work out for me and I tried to return it with the store manager.

The store manager told me they can't do returns on prepaid devices, it is not possible. I was like what????

T-Mobiles policy on their website, the policy that came in the device's box, and your store employee all stated I could return the device within 14 days (well besides the employees who told me 30 days).

The store manager simply told me she couldn't process the return and to call customer support if I had a problem. At no point did it feel like the manager wanted to help resolve the situation.

I felt like I had been cheated and lied to. Everything says I should be able to return the device, and the manager basically tells me "no, it's not their problem, and to go find help somewhere else".

I called customer support multiple times and they all insisted the store should do the return. They said because the store processed the order wrong, and never gave me a receipt, I had to do the return in the store. I have no account information or anything, just a charge on my credit card.

When I went back into the store I explained the situation to the manager. They made a couple calls to other local T-Mobile stores and again repeated they can't do returns on prepaid devices.

My recourse now is to deal with T-Mobile's legal department who I've had to write a letter to (yes a letter, no email). What should have been a simple return has turned into a big time-wasting situation.

If you need to go to a T-Mobile I suggest finding a different location than this one.< /review>

Wow! I had gone to two other T Mobiles and was met with rude and dismissive associates that ended up sending me to this location and honestly I am so glad that they did. Emily and Aaliyah were warm and very friendly. Just when I thought all hope was lost they were able to assist me and my issue was resolved. If you have to go to T Mobile, go here! They will go above and beyond for you!<//review>

They don't know their job. Very UNPROFESSIONAL staff. Don't have any info on the latest plans. Manager is never there in case you have to complain her. Girl with curly hair doesn't know anything what she is doing in there. If you go around the time they are about to close, they will try everything to kick you out of there so that they can go home early.<//review>

Emily, the store manager was welcoming and accommodating. She knew I was not “tech savvy” at all and she gladly helped my sons and I set up our new phones! She even taught us some new tricks we had no clue about!  In these crazy times of COVID is wonderful to see people helping each other. I highly recommend this location for any of your Sprint wireless needs!!!<//Text>< username>

Outstanding costumer service!!

The team at this Sprint location went above and beyond to provide the assistance needed with a new iPhone 11. Thank you so much.

Now I can start posting reviews with my new phone. 😊<//Text>

Lied about the phone they sold me. When asked about battery life and memory, salesman said all are about the same..did NOT Let me know that this phone has NO battery and lasts only a few hours on a charge..so essentially a corded phone. Didn't give me the AAA discount when asked up front he said wait and we would do it later..but didn't. Will definitely seek another store and carrier asap and will not wait until I am in immediate need due to a broken phone.<//review>

Elizabeth made our lives so easy! We finally switched to Sprint from AT&T because it was so expensive! So far we haven't had a single difference in service quality! Elizabeth answered all of our questions and never once was rude, even when a very rude lady came in and interrupted when we were in the middle of being helped. She even made wonderful small talk with us so no one got bored or there wasn't any awkward silence haha. Her customer service skills alone made the experience so pleasant. Especially since it took almost 2 hours to get us going with our new phones! 10/10 Elizabeth!!<//Text>

It was refreshing to work  RICHARD HINOJOSA. He took the time to explain all of the features
on the devices I was looking at and even showed me a way to save money on my current plan.

I will refer my friends and family to Richard. He makes it easy.

I love this store!  Chris Loza is awesome. He knew exactly knew what I needed, helped with my new phone selection and saved me money on my plan. Every time I come to this location everyone is friendly, makes it fun and saves me money. Go see Chris for sure.</Review>

The staff are very friendly, the only problem I had was I did not have a California state ID so I could not make an account because of Sprint policy. Okay I get that, but when the lady who was helping me was on the phone with her manager not only was he extremely rude but he insulted me!!<//text>

< Review>
LOVE this store!  Richard Hinosoja (new manager) and Marques Morton were extremely helpful.  After a terrible experience at the Oxnard store we came to this store just to see if after 15 years we should change from Sprint to another carrier.  NO, we stayed with Sprint and will ONLY come to this store.  The customer service is what you expect and the wait time in minimal!  No waiting 1 hour or more just to get someone to answer a question!  TAKE THE 5 MINUTE DRIVE FROM OXNARD TO JOHNSON DRIVE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!  I PROMISE!  Take the Johnson Drive exit off the 101 and it's right there across from Toys R Us, by Taco Bell and Century Nails! Thank you guys for reminding why I chose Sprint many years ago!!!</Review>

<Text>I had called customer service to get help troubleshooting my device.  They advised me to take it to the nearest repair store which was this one on Johnson Dr.  When I got there the store was nearly empty.  I thought "good I won't have to wait".  I spoke to the technician briefly about what was happening with my phone.  He told me he could not help me.  I explained to him that sprint customer service sent me here. He reiterated that he could not do anything for me.  He did not even attempt to run a diagnostic or troubleshoot my device at all.. He informed me that "according to his training that he had received there was nothing he could do for me".  He said that I had to go to a corporate store to get my issue resolved and sent me to Oxnard.  The Oxnard store took 15 min with my device and resolved my issues without any hassels.</Text><rate>2</rate><name>Andrea Sanchez< /name><UserId.>115536457583939683284<//UserId.><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I love the sprint store on Johnson Dr.  You have to wait so long at the other Sprint stores. I received Excellent Customer Service and Care from Sales Associates Aleeah Puga and Yesenia Martinez. They both helped me with my new phone and to lower my Sprint bill.<//text>

I have never felt so comfortable going in a sprint store and felt invited. I live in Oxnard and do not feel welcomed in that store. I have to say that Richard Hinojosa jr has made my visit complete. He has great work ethic and very precise. He actually needs  raise. Love him. Congratulations to ur new district manager.< /Text>

<review>I got tatted for the first time, on my ribs, by Felix and let me tell you his patience and professionalism was impeccable. Regarding the tattoo, really happy with it. There’s an area that needs to get fill in (he stopped because my skin was really irritated and swollen) but he’ll do it once it’s heal. Honestly, I truly appreciated his great customer service and the vibe of the place. Everyone was friendly and have great manners. They’ll be seeing me soon 🙏🏼 Thank you again Felix…</review>< pics>

I reached out to artillery ink in the beginning of March to get a tattoo. My tattoo artist was James I came in for a consult and met with him and spoke for about two minutes and then I was told that he would reach out to me later. His wife is the one who replies to everybody who works with him. I followed up with a week and asked if there was any update and she said there was none he was still working on it. Then I reached out the next week, the next week and the next week and she always says that he was still working on it. I have not Heard anything back and it’s almost end of may.... poor customer service. Can’t even follow up with customers weekly. I get if you’re busy but damn have the courtesy to reach back out to your customers...<//review>

Danny miss spelled my grandmothers name on my ribs offered to give me a cover up for free and then when I showed him what I wanted he said that would cost me extra after he put a miss spelled name on my body not something that comes off

In response to the owner - really I miss spelled it have the texts where I sent him the list with spelling and font ?<//text>

He offered a free cover up (like a simple rose) and then to add that name at the bottom of the stack of names. But you came back with a huge side piece, which wasn’t apart of the agreement.

Very few things in life meet or exceed your expectations, however my experience with this shop DID JUST THAT! Professionalism=✅ Great Atmosphere=✅ Talented Artists=✅ Fairly Priced=✅. Anyone feeling like getting a tattoo, I challenge you to not just read the reviews and make a decision. Go check them out and have a conversation. By the end I promise, you will be convinced this is the place FOR YOU!<//review>< pics>

I appreciate when the owners are present.
Also the work done by the artist (will) I don’t go to just anyone and after 2-3 people constantly recommending him to me .
Not only is he kind hearted but he’s very professional.
He has done two pieces on me and they won’t be the last.
He has spent so much time and effort into the work and triple checks that everything is looking good on my end. I highly recommend him !<//review>< Pics>

You can connect and have a great time chatting while he goes in on precise detail on your tattoo, which makes the whole experience that much better. I’ve never been felt more comfortable getting a tattoo where I know the detail I want will turn out perfect! His line work is spot on.

<text>Rob the piercer was straight up AMAZING for my 3 year old. He took his time, made her feel comfortable and spoke to her as the child she is and walked through every step he took being sure she was ok. You would have thought he was piercing his own daughter. I would recommend anyone of any age who is looking for piercings.

The tattoo shop in itself was very clean, very professional for a tattoo parlor, sterile, and a welcoming environment.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOj9ni7Qltq01xa_00gTwM3QUGSdkG2Bxa0UsSP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dc821621d9e90f:0x21632f91c1a234ac<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I went in about a little over a month ago, and got a small tattoo that only took about 10 mins. Artists didn’t tell me his name or gave me his card. So I went back a month later to get a touch up and the guy that was there told me he thinks the guy who originally did it should do it. And for whatever reason didn’t want to do it for me. Yet I told him I didn’t know his name and he gave me random cards to find him on social media. Eventually I did on the artillery website and contacted the artist and he took over a week to respond. He told me anytime next week would work and told me to pick a day, so
I did and still never responded to my message on our appointment date. Yet he was posting constantly on his social media. Then another week went by and so did the day I said I would like to come in and still left on read and ignored... bad experience here and really bad customer service. Went to the one in Temecula and the guy was super nice, Gave me his name and card and was very respectful. Would not return to this Murrieta location...</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This shop gave me great service. I originally wanted a piece done in Vegas while I was going to be there for my wedding, I left about 6 online inquiries for pricing and the ones that actually did respond told me to come in for a consiltation. It was really frustrating. So i gave on Vegas and emailed this local shop. I had a response in like an hour and had a price range eithin the few minutes we were talking. 4 days later, Haley gave me a beautiful word stem rose tattoo. She did amazing work and I am so grateful that she was my artist because she made me super comfortable during my time there. I recommend Artillery ink 100%.</Text>< userid>

ASTONISHING, PROFESSIONALISM, AND NOTHING SHORT OF MIRACULOUS. I got out of a bad relationship, and wanted to do something for myself, I decided I would get an entire sleeve for my FIRST tattoo. Apprehensive I contacted ARTILLERY INK. And they scheduled my first session with Speedy. Let me tell you something folks, he is one amazing individual his work ethic and attention to detail is EXTREMELY comforting and his raw talent for making the tattoo come alive is honestly breathtaking. Every week I keep coming back to finish my sleeve and I am so unbelievably blessed and happy to have chosen speedy to work on my arm. Recommending him would do him in injustice, YOU NEED MY MAN TO BLAST YOU UP. I WONT GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!</text>

<review>Daniel Garcia gave me the best tattooing experience I've ever had. He took me as a walk in, Drew up a stencil from an idea I had, tatted me up, and had me out of there in less than 20 minutes. Didn't feel a thing! Hands down the lightest hands ever.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I’ve been getting tattooed by Jerrick Allen since he first started tattooing in 2013. I now have 7 beautiful pieces from him and I plan to get the last of my tattoos with him as well. He has even tattooed about half of my coworkers. By far, he has the best prices and I always look forward to hanging out with everyone at the shop as well. Jerrick and his artists are definitely the people to go to< /text>< Pictures>

I moved to Cali 4mths ago and already moving back bc of these kinds of experiences. I called and the owner sounded very nice but once I got there  (n 10min.) the person available said that the 10-20min 6letter words I wanted would take an hr and I needed to come back? She had a client coming that never showed n the time I was there. I’m not sure how any tattoo artist would turn down money for a simple tattoo but she seemed to not care or want too?? And I’m an amazing tipper plus I’m super nice? I looked at the art work for 20mins before I left and there was a walk in that they said would b seen and n that time I could’ve had my 2words done?? I don’t understand??</Review>

<Text>Artillery ink absolutely kills it no other place is gonna take care of you like they will plus all of the artists are very friendly and extremely talented! Jerrick has amazing skill and gave me a piece I absolutely love and can't stop looking at. Can't wait to go back and start more. Overall no place beats Artillery ink!</Text>< pics>

Rob did mine and two of my friends piercings on one of their busiest days (Friday 13th) and between our earlobes, helix, conch, and navel piercings, he made it the most comfortable and easy experience! This was my first time getting pierced in a tattoo shop and it was a great experience! Definitely recommended for any age looking for any piercing!< /Review>

The place looks and feels beyond clean! The gentleman that was working on my tattoo had so much patience due to me having my 3month old baby with me. He did not mind the fact that I had To attend to my baby he was beyond patient and I loved My tattoo!</Review>

I went here to get one of my older tattoos covered up by Ramon. The shop is really chill but the artists are also really professional.
Ramon did a really great job covering up my tattoo and listened to what I wanted. My design turned out the exact way I wanted it to.
They also don’t over charge like some shops do. :)< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Artillery Ink is an amazing shop to go in and get some work done! The shop is one of a kind in the fact that it’s not an intimidating environment like the stigma around tattoo shops usually have. You can go in with your family, friends, and kids with no problem and enjoy the company of others whether it be other clients or artists - everyone is friendly.  I’ve personally started a cover up tattoo on my left arm and have spent about 15 hours under the needle in their so far. I went to Jerrick and he, as well as his wife, are awesome people who will help you with anything you need an make sure your accommodations are met! I highly recommend you to visit them and see for yourself what it’s like inside their new shop!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I was in Texas at the time and she was so kind and patient while we messaged back and forth, obviously with a bit of a time difference. I finally came in on NYE and met with Adam and we quickly went to the back to start putting together my idea. He was great with letting me know his input and we finalized the piece after about 30 mins.
He has a very light hand and was so thorough with his work. he asked me multiple times throughout the process how I was doing and he never even took a break (during a 4+ hr tattoo). My ride hadn't arrived yet and instead of just having me wait, he literally spent up to almost the last minute adding little touches and highlights. I am sofa king pleased with the work and have already received so many compliments on it. trust when I am ready for my next one that I'll wait til I'm back out in CA to visit with Adam again.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I have been back there 4 more times to get more work done by him!!! All the guys & gals. at the shop are excellent artists and they are very strict on keeping everything clean and sterile!! I definitely recommend this shop to my friends! There are a few other shops in the area, but this place is open late, has a great atmosphere and the tattoists are excellent! I personally recommend Tristen because he has a real light touch, does not cause any unnecessary discomfort and the man has serious skills!!! This guy is young and he has a really bright future ahead of him!!<//review>< pictures>

<review>I can't say enough GREAT things about this shop! This is by far the best shop with the best artists in the Inland Empire, and as much work as I've had done, I've been to alotta shops. Two of my favorite artists are here from other shops, so I kinda followed them here. Charles and Rez are my amazing artists, and I get compliments on my work on a daily, and always refer them to my guys at artillery. Everyone else there is also very talented, and I've seen some beautiful work being done by every artist there in general. They really make you feel at home, everyone is so friendly and it's just makes for an even better experience .So with that, back I go tomorrow to get my current work in progress finished :))< /review>< pictures>

I’ve been coming here for about a year now, and Jerrick has never let me down. its a pretty big shop with a lot of booths.
I’ve gotten my sleeve finished by Jerrick and he’s currently working on my leg sleeve.
To put it in perspective, I drive all the way from Chula Vista because the work there is phenomenal.<//Text>

<Review>I got two dermals done by Sierra Skye in my face and it was quick and caused very little pain. I could tell she knew what she was doing and was super professional and laid back and a genuinely an awesome person. Anyone who has had bad experiences getting pierced knows that when it's bad, it's really bad and would appreciate going to see this girl. She helped me with the placement of my dermals and obviously has good taste and lots of experience. I would definitely get pierced by her again in the future.

<user>111931413030371809086<//user><Review>I took my son to get his first tattoo. It is a memorial tattoo for his Grandma and Grandpa so it had to be perfect. Jerrick was highly recommended and he delivered. He did more than what we could have ever expected. It came out amazing. It took a total of 5 hours so I had some time to check out the shop and other artist. Super clean, high energy, family. That is how I describe Artillery Ink in Temecula. In my experience, tattoo artist are quiet and dont really like you watching them work. Here at Artillery Ink, all the artist do amazing work and are proud and thankful to show their work. Best experience. I set an appt to get a new tattoo for myself. Thanks Jerrick and Keisha!<//Review><user_name>Alicia Gonzalez< /user_name><gmap_id>0x80dc821621d9e90f:0x21632f91c1a234ac</gmap_id>< Pics>

Got my piercing by sierra & The first time was a good experience she charged me $40 for a dermal everything went fine that day except that she called me later on that day that she forgot to have my sign the paper work before I got my piercing I even left her a tip. Second time I went back I brought her 2 customers . I got a quote the day before for my cartillage on my ears to be pierced for $30.00 so I thought good deal why not get more . So I got them done I even had to buy my own piercing from the mall beacause  they did not have diamond piercings . So after we're done getting pierced she ask us to sign the paper work after she pierced Us we all paid i paid $30 for mine & they paid $40 each for there's & we all gave her a small tip  . We paid and we left . Next thing you know I'm getting a call telling me that we didn't give her the right amount ? So she comes out of the shop and talks to me and she tells me my piercing was $60 after all . I was confused cause she told me $30. But for good for bad I'm not that type of person to not pay I mean she already did the work . So all I had were $20 bills . So I asked her if she had change so she went back inside to check and still said we were short $10 from the $40 I have her that I was suppose to get back $10 so she added it onto my $30? She didn't even give me my $10 back cause she still said we were short . So all over all I ended up paying $70 for 2 ear piercings . Plus I bought my own piercing . And on top of it when she did my ears she did the first Time with the wrong needle so she had to go thru it again with a bigger size . . And the second ear she even stabbed all the way thru to the back of my ear . I mean good prices on piercings but not worth all this. I just feel like if it was organized better everything would of went way smoother . And I could of left a way better review .< /Review>

<Review>A professional company with reasonable prices. Sometimes they forget that I'm on the account by staying consistently staying in touch with my husband via HIS email address, and with me only periodically via my separate email address.

Also, I would like them to consider getting a better rate for our rental in accordance with the CURRENT going Bay area rate for our area.

Otherwise Krystal Property Management is doing a fine job.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1620933148430, 'text': "Hi Dr. Fierro, thanks so much for your honest feedback.

<review>Unprofessional, unethical, perform slipshod jobs and thefts.
As a previous tenant/renter i would strongly suggest not to give Krystle Properties any business.
The unit right next door to me was having toilet issues. Instead of sending a licensed professional they send one of the staff's bf to do to the job. So they are cutting corners and double charging the owners of the building. Anyways the guy messed up (not the first time) causing my toilet to over flow, which caused feces and bio hazard to spill and spread all over the bathroom and the surrounding carpet which is 5 ft from the kitchen where we prepare food. Once we told that guy that our toilet is now overflowing he came over looked around and run off.
I called maintenance who sent out a licensed plumber, who fixed the plumbing problem.
Krystle Properties never sent out a cleaner to clean the caked feces out of our bathroom even thou we were told they would. After making several attempts to contact krystle about the cleaner at the end of the day, 23 hours after the toilet over flowing they told us, the tenants, that we have to contact the cleaner, at that moment they provided the number to the cleaners whom they should have by law and ethics called because they are the management company.
The place smelt horrible due to the fact that feces and bio hazard waste waste soaked into the carpet. 2.5 weeks later Davina came over to inspect. She had a horrible attitude repeating that she doesn't smell anything beside cat pee and it's not sewage that's causing the smell. She told me that she would have the carpet replaced.
We made several attempts to contact the carpet company because Davina refuse to and when they finally came out (another 2 weeks later) they took measurements then told us that krystle would contact us about the carpet being replaced.
Basically, the overflown toilet and the bio hazards waste water that sat in the carpets could have caused serious illness and even death, Krystle Properties refused to treat the matter serious. However i did and they treated me as if i was a problem.

Liars; we were shorted on our security deposit. We were charged $250 for hauling cost because Krystle Properties Management lied. On a document KPM clearly wrote; ---- called day the tenants dumped items. This is the fee please notate this" 2 big tv arm and a mattress set. i spoke with --- and he said he never told them that, he told them the opposite. Krystle Property Management lied about the both of us to pocket $250. That's a shame, how desperate and low does one (or a company in this case) have to be to throw two good tenants under the bus for $250. They pocket $250, which employee pocket that money or was it the company?</review><Resp>None</Resp>< username>

Krystle Properties - hands down 5 star rating! Krystle is highly professional and very deligent in her approach as a realtor.  She takes the time to get to know your individual needs and works hard to make a home buyers dream come true. Her responsiveness to her clients supersedes any other that I have worked with in the past. I love her upbeat personality and her optimism as we explored Solano county for my future home.  I highly recommend her!</review>

< Review>
We have been super pleased with the services from Krystal Properties .  First off, they found us a top notch tenant right away.  They are extremely responsive and their online communication is the best.  Also their fees are reasonable even for maintenance services. We have used another property mgr in the past and the experience with Krystle properties has been 1000% better.<//Review>

I could not find enough words to express our deepest respect and appreciation when it comes to give feedback about Krystle Properties. After having a pretty bitter experience with another leasing agency, Krystle Property was a breath of fresh air.
I consider us (speaking on behalf of my husband as well) very lucky working with Krystle Karimian directly.
Her professionalism and sincerity exceeded our expectations. She met with us on a short notice without any delays and hesitation (do I need to mention it was way pass her normal business hours?!?!).
We had a spark connection from the moment we met in person. She quickly understood our needs, expectations and style to do the business. Her follow-up is impeccable!!  Krystle kept updating us on every step company was taking to lease our Benicia Property.
All obstacle, such as “off - season leasing”, then shelter in place restrictions, tenant’s qualification during COVID-19 shut down and more, were overcome with flying colors!!!
Without further delay, she found an amazing family (tenants) that respect our property and treat it as their own home.
We would recommend Krystle Property to anyone who is looking for a company with honesty, integrity and commitments to provide an exceptional result in speedy matter.<//review>

I've been with Krystle Properties for a few months now and everything has gone great - from quickly finding good tenants for my three available properties to taking care of minor maintenance items. Also it was a pleasant surprise that they auto deposited all the July rents into my bank account on July 1. I have another rental coming available soon and plan to turn it over to Krystle.

Update - now I've been with Krystle for over a year, they are managing six of my properties,  and everything is running smoothly.</text>

If you are a landlord looking for a property management company, this is it. Very professional, no worries about repairs. The repairs on done in a timely manner.
While they are  a little on the high side... you get what you pay for. Good quality.</Review>

Many repairs were needed to my property. Which set me off to a negative start. However the repairs were managed in a good fashion. Just a few more than i expected. Krystle located a secure tenant withing days.  2 months of positive income. The owners portal is very useful, and the email responses and notifications are up to par. Basically, Krystle is managing my property in the most confident manner. Their team has not let me down.  i only gave 4 stars because our business relationship is new. And needs a test of time. So far, so good.< /Review>

I have known Krystle and Derrick for more than ten years. They have been nothing short of amazing in every interaction I had with them. Not only they are top-notch professionals, they are deeply caring about their clients as friends and family. Here is my simple advice: if you are interested in doing any business real estate related in Vallejo/Benicia area, run, don't walk, to Krystle Properties. I sure am glad I did exactly that ten years ago.< /Text>

I must say I am very pleased with Krystle!  My renter recently gave their 30 day notice and I live 400 miles away.  I was nervous about at the entire process and when you consider this crazy Covid process, it added more anxiety.  What if the renter left things in shambles?  What if we couldn’t find a quality renter?  Do I have to go and preview the property?  Krystle took care of it all and had a new renter in the house in about 4 days of turnaround.  Any normal wear and tear issues were taken care of by their excellent team of professionals (I received emails for every needed repair).  They were able to find a high quality renter at the monthly rate I needed.  And while I sometimes feel like they aren’t getting back to me in the amount of time I was expecting, they always come through and I also realize they have 100’s of properties to manage and mine is not the only one.  This last go around confirms to me why I am content with Krystle properties, thank you!<//review>

Krystle Properties has done a great job in managing my property.  I have had really good tenants.  If I have questions, Krystle Properties are always accessible! I would have rated as 5 stars but there was a period of time last year where I not contacted for repairs over the limits established.< /text>

Krystle made my recent transition from a previous management company totally painless. They are very knowledgeable, effective and responsive.  They manage everything related to my properties in a responsible and professional manner.   Krystle has helped bring peace and joy to be a property owner (a rare experience in today’s regulatory environment)!  I would highly recommend.</review>

<review>It has been over 10 years now, that Krystle has managed my multi-unit property. During this time we’ve had mostly wonderful tenants, and one not so great tenant. It was in dealing with the difficult tenant that Krystle came through, and earned my everlasting trust. The whole staff is very supportive in all advertising, renting, and maintenance issues. The owners are helpful, and very attentive – even in the most difficult circumstances. I will continue to work with Krystle, for as long as I own the building.

Well, they went from being a 5-Star down to a LESS THAN 1-Star.  Did you really forget to take our email address off your Automated Review Requests????  This shows how LITTLE you know about your clients and how little you value customer service.  YOU FIRED US, THE CLIENT WITH 3 DAYS NOTICE.  NOT LEGAL, NOT ETHICAL.  My advice to you Derrick, just talk to people, find out what's happening without bias, just pick up the phone and speak with people.  It will go a long way to improve your customer service skill set - which for us is VERY LACKING.<//text>

<text>I have a lot of experience with property managers in several towns and Krystle has been good and trustworthy for about 10 years now.  It has been a  better experience than I've had with others.  They respect my boundaries and that I am the final decision maker. and I've had a good income flow. I do recommend them highly. I sometimes wish there was one person to coordinate with instead of multiple departments all working on their own.  It works great with some but not with others.  The new maintenance manager is great to work with.< /text><time>1603468728732< /time><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

If you are in need of property management there is no one better and if you try to manage your property you don't know what you are missing. You'd probably make more money by paying them a small fee every month with you not doing anything. KPM is been mine for 10 years now and will be for life!<//Text>

I am very happy with Krystle properties.  They are very professional and on top of whatever issues come up with my units and tenants.  It is sometimes difficult to reach them but overall, I gave them 5 stars and I am truly grateful for their service.</text>

<text>We get our rent money on time.
They notify if there are any issues right away which has been almost zero for last 3-4 years.
They are nice to work with.
The most important thing was that they found new tenants for us without any loss in money for us, meaning they were on it!
Overall it’s been great with Krystle Properties and if you own property in American Canyon/Vallejo area, use them!!< /text>< response>

For property owners, they are absolutely the best. Every aspect is covered by their great team. Our last turn around was so smooth that it took less than 30 days from vacancy, painting, minor wear and tear replacements, vetting new tenants, to occupancy!  What could be better?!</review>

<review>We are so lucky to have a business like Krsytle Properties for finding a tenant for our rental property.  They are hard working, and diligent about being sure they find the right person when we are looking for a tenant.  They always make sure we know when they show the place.  They are polite, and respectful.  If they can’t make an appointment, they are sure to call and let you know.  It is nice working with them.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>I want to say thank you for being a property management easy button!
Your management skills, your mediation between the tenant and myself and the subcontractors that you supply from time to time, without breaking the bank is great!

Much Appreciated!

Krystle and her excellent team manage a number of properties for me. The team treat my properties as if they are their own in terms of care, upkeep etc. They communicate clearly and punctually and both treat my tenants with care and respect, but also optimize my income.

I'll start out by saying, I usually don't take the time to post  good or bad reviews, but this time is different. My profession has required me to move a great deal over the years. In this particular case I was transferred to the Bay Area. Not knowing much about the area I did happen to see a variety of some very nice homes for our family through Krystle Properties. The one we selected was in Hiddenbrooke. The application process was very simple and we even got to meet Krystle on the day we signed the lease! She is super nice and very professional just like the rest of her staff. If you are looking for a nice property to rent in this part of the Bay Area, there is no need to look any further. Beautiful home selection and a very caring staff. Thank you again Krystle to you and your staff!!!<//Text>

They have horrible service , I had turn in a application for a property and paid $70!!  they told me they will get back to me in a couple days ,they never did I had to call just to have them tell me that I never turn it in and/or they can't find it . Spoke to the manager and he can't figure out what happened. I got my refund back because I kept my receipt and they never apologize for having me go through all of this . I will not recommend having them as your properly manager.</text>

<Review>After having been a property owner rental customer for many years I got a call that there maintainence issues that needed addressing.  I replied that I would go down and take a look and was told that my taking a look wasn’t allowed!  Not allowed?! I told them that I either would be allowed to look at my own property or I’d be looking for a new manager.  KRYSTLE allowed it but only with a chaperone from the company.  I arrived to find a lengthy list of issues that had I had never been informed of and that the KRYSTLE person had been going over with the tenant as what needed to be done.  It would seem as though KRYSTLE forgot who they were working for and we parted ways.</Review>< Pictures>

(Long but full of info) I don't usually give a bad review , let alone a review on ANYTHING! But this was HORRIBLE AT IT FINEST!!!! If I could give 0stars I would!!!! During this time in age it is very difficult to live on your own as the rent prices keep going up everywhere you look so we decided to move as a family so it wouldn't be hard on everybody, this place discriminate against AGE and etc.  and it's a fact. Abdul karimian was the one that was handling our family paperwork and was to meet up with him 2 days later after he only ran my mother in-law  and father in-law credit first because they was the oldest in his words and even though my husband was going to be the primary person on the lease do to  his 800+ credit. We met with Abdul the following day and boy I'm NOT over  exaggerating BUT IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!!

We went to him said good morning and he had a hard time saying it back as we are holding our hands out to greet him he stated in his words" oh I usually don't say good morning nor do I shake people hands I like to get straight to the point cause I'm a number men I speak numbers" 😶😶😶 then he went on to tell my husband that he have a 20yr old(by the way my husband is not 20yr old he is 24+)  that people like him is not responsible enough and that's he ran the oldest people first. Like it's obvious that he didn't want to deal with us from the gate he act like we came in there looking for a handout we ALL (5) work very VERY good paying jobs at hospitals and some truck drivers. I couldn't believe this guy then he said he will pass it to the owners when we left.

The following day got a text from Abdul saying the owners said to stop running credit and to refund our money back. No problem as I do know sometimes things happen and might not be the perfect fairytale candidates they was imagining. I'll take that fine. Keep pushing . I'm not complaining about us not passing which was already a fail before we left the office,  what I'm complaining about is the level of service that the company should upheld when dealing with customers as you never know what type of situation any family might be in or going through.

So I called to speak to someone hire up and that was a BAD idea as they are ALL  family.  Spoke to Krystal to tell her the experience that was distasteful and unprofessional and only thing should could say that he been doing it for 50years so obviously that's a problem right there he is a old head thinking back in the days. Neither did she care about the problem as she hurried me off the phone.

If you will like your time wasted,   Humiliated and  discrimination then this is the place for you!!! Good luck and the other reviews that raves about this place is fake!!!<//text>

<review>KPM has always been great for me personally as well as anyone I refer. Being in a referral based business myself it can be a big risk referring one of my clients to anyone for a service they need because your reputation is at stake for something you have no control over. I’ve had people I work with but I would never refer them because of that. With KPM I don’t give it a 2nd thought as they value service just as much as me and for you property owners trying to manage places yourselves I’d talk to them as they are worth ever penny they charge and over the long-haul you actually save by using them. Better rents, much lower vacancy factors, & you can’t put a price tag on the stress of dealing with a good tenant let alone bad ones. If you are in need of something they offer there is no need to go anywhere else. KPM is the place to be!!<//review><user_id>105633360867700901074<//user_id><Resp>None< /Resp><Rate>5<//Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><name>Sean Murphy<//name><gmapID>0x8085731a0a0d23ab:0x2e7e8f4e1267e91c< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Our visit was very unprofessional. We called at least four times to set up an appointment and they never called back.  We finally had to go to the office to set up an appointment, which was an "open house" which was only a 15 min window (the shortest open house I've ever heard of) and the realtor hadn't even seen the place. The whole experience was not very satisfying and they were not helpful unless you went in and bothered them. Even then, however, they did not seem pleased to have my business. You can find better rentals and managers elsewhere.< /review>

Absolute Integrity in Real Estate in the Vallejo, Solano, Napa, area!  In Vallejo there is no competition when it comes to a real estate company that can back up what they say.  None come close to the professional caring attention that this business provides.  I was lucky enough to be in contact with them when I need emergency assistance with housing that also involved my Section 8 certificate.  The apartment I have now looks out over the entire bay and was once consider the location for the original capitol of California. Thank you, Thank you to Krystal & Derrick and all the hardworking team that make up a business that cares about Vallejo.

5 Stars!!

This is my second time renting a house through Krystle Property Management over the past 5 years. I have nothing but good things to say about the way that Krystle and Derrick have worked with me in finding suitable housing in Vallejo, on short notice. And...I received the rental deposit back from them promptly at the end of my first tenure with them with no hassle.

They are very professional in their approach and have always been very responsive to what few maintenance requests that I made over the years. One thing that I *really* appreciate is the smooth functioning website that they have which allows me to make electronic rent payments and to file maintenance requests from wherever I am as I travel quite a bit and USPS mail is just too slow and inconvenient.

I hope to be able to engage with KPM the next time that I need a rental in the Vallejo area.< /Text>

From tours of our possible new homes to closing documents, Krystle was there every step of the way.
And even now, after we've moved in she is still there, making this home buying experience something we will always cherish.

<Text>This had to be one of my worse experiences with a rental company! Derrick Karimian is a joke and disrespectful monster. He was all buddy buddy when it came to me first renting the property but when it came down to the end of it he was plain rude and shady. I have always paid my rent on time, never rude and Respectful but they tried to cheat me. Do your self a favor and go far away from every one in Krystle Property! They have no souls, no respect for others, only want your money and will never help you. They are the absolute worse and tell you whatever you want to hear so they can get you to pay. I even complained to them to the Better Business Burue. Darren if your reading this learn how to respect and be ethical with others!<//Text><user_id>111264340434734244415</user_id><gmapID>0x8085731a0a0d23ab:0x2e7e8f4e1267e91c</gmapID>< pics>

These guy are the most Unprofessional/ Racist people in the world. I applied for a rental property and spoke with Abdul by the way i have a A1 credit 760 fico score And met all the requirements as directed, My house hold made over 6 times what the property monthly rental fees required and he said you are to young( 24 years old!)( My kid is your age!) Im a full time commercial Hazmat driver with a ton of professional references and he said i dont knoe let me talk to the owner...Rather than treating me as a equal applicant he Never processed my Application and said i cant come pick up the application, App Fees, Ect and that im not accepted????How? and why? Hmmm Maybe Due to the tone of my skin? Please Dont do any Buisness with these guys thats seriously unfair!< /text>

< Review>
DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! ABDUL & DERRICK ARE CROOKS, SCAMMERS, LIARS!
The manager, ABDUL KARIMIAN, spoke to me prior to my renting a 5 bedroom house in Vallejo. I had an 800+ credit score and plenty of money in the bank. I told him that my fiancé and I would like to have classmate roommates, as we were students and $2,400 a month was too expensive for us as we were both getting a double Master's Degree. He told me that it would be no problem to have roommates added onto my lease, and they could pay me and I could pay the rental company.  My lease said no subletting, so I triple checked with him that this would be ok, and he gave me his word. I asked for it in writing multiple times, and he said take my word, so I stupidly did. Biggest mistake of my life.

We had roommates for one year and everything went ok. One year into our lease, they moved out for medical rotations and we wanted to add new roommates. We went about the process as we did before, and as I had discussed with Abdul. We had each roommate fill out a rental application, background check, etc with Krystle Property. I had formed an agreement with each of them as to how much they had to pay me so that I could pay the rental company on time. One roommate emailed this agreement to Krystle Property. The next thing I know, a very angry, violent man is standing in my doorframe, screaming at me.

His name was DERRICK KARIMIAN and he was the son of Abdul. He didn’t knock, he just entered the opening of our house since the front door was cracked open. He yelled at the top of his lungs at my fiance, telling him that we had three days to correct this subletting or move out. I told him that I had spoken to his father and he had given me his word that it was ok. He said it didn’t matter. He utterly embarrassed me in front of our housemates and he sped away.

I called him a few hours later to give him time to cool down. He said that he wouldn’t allow us to take corrective action and we had to move out in three days. Three days to move out of a 5 bedroom house, to get it cleaned, to clean the carpet, and to pack meant no sleeping or eating and severe anxiety. There was no talking to Derrick, as he threatened to take legal action against us if we didn’t move. We packed, painted the house, went through inspections, cleaned the carpets, and had to have 2 current roommates who were on the lease move out as well. It was a disaster as we were in the middle of final exams for our Master’s degree.

They emailed our incoming roommates behind our backs (our incoming roommates were loyal and told us about this), telling them they were evicting us but would like them to sign onto a new lease with them. What crooks! They did this so that they could increase the rental price by $200 for my roommates. After doing everything they asked and leaving the place much better than they gave it to us, they had the nerve to charge us $100 to remove wood from the backyard that had been there when we moved in from the prior tenants. Lesson learned- DO NOT RENT FROM THIS SOULLESS COMPANY AND ALWAYS GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING!

Also, during our year living there, it took our toilet overflowing 3 times and our bathtub leaking down from upstairs down into our dining room for them to take action for maintenance we requested a long time prior. This company sends the cheapest maintenance people who are sometimes drugged and don’t know what they’re doing. STEER CLEAR OF THESE SCUMBAGS!</Review>

I have been working with KPM for about three years. KPM has provided very professional services to take care of our rental properties. I am very happy with their services and how they are keeping a good balance to keep both me and the tenant happy. They keep me informed of all major issues with the properties and upkeep that's needed. As an owner, we wanted to have happy tenants and KPM is definitely providing the services to make that happen. I have not heard any unhappy tenants due to conditions of the properties and KPM's services. We will continue to use KPM's expertise and service.< /Text>

<review>The worst Property Management Company on the Planet.I had to call  and email repeatedly just to get a response.When I was finaly able to set up an appointment,things got even worst.I arrived at the office only to find out that their parking lot is only for thier employee's.They insist that thier client park on the streets.That set the tone for the customer service you will recieve.We were rushed through the application process,and was told that that one of the properties that we had agreed to view was unaviliable due to a plumbing problem.I was told that the tenats in the back unit was using the water in the front unit.The thing about this is number one a simple courtesy  call that the unit couldnt be view would have been nice,however these people have no clue on customer service.Secondly in their ad there was no mention of a secondary stucture or people living in it.The Agent said she would take us to a simlar property.She end up taking us to the worst part of Vallejo.The first apartment she took us to we could barely get into.The front stairs are a difinite safety hazard(By the agents own admission)The previous tenat was suprised by us visiting.The unit itself was full of code violations, uninhabitabal is how I would describe it.The next Apartment we viewed was even worst.The minute we opened the door an overpowering scent of mildew greeted us.As we further entered the apt.we were greeted with MOLD,in also every room.We left immediatly,We tried to ask the Agent questions however she basically threw the application at us and left.We went on to view another property they had listed by ourselves.Their ad listed it as a penthouse,what it really was ,was a ATTIC!!!!!!These people have no ideal of what customer service is,They are very deceptive in thier ads,and after dealing with these people and viewing thier properties,one word comes to mind......SLUM LORDS!!!!! stay away from this company.< /review>< username>

<Review>The skatepark is super simple. A half pipe and a couple boxes on a concrete pad. The amenities of the Community Center Park are great -nice playgrounds, shaded picnic pavilion, sports fields and restrooms.< /Review>< username>

By far one of the best parks for the kiddos. They've got an upgraded playground, volleyball court, soccer and football fields, softball field, skatepark, basketball courts and picnic area with BBQ grills. They no longer have working sinks in the picnic area and the drinking fountain doesn't work. Other than that, summer time is awesome with the kids. Just don't come out at night, its a little sketchy.< /Text>

< Review>
My son loves the skate park. To bad it is right by the cop shop. We felt a little unsettled while there because of the sherriffs dispatching to their calls. No disrespect to law enforement but you wont find tranquillity here.</Review>

A nice place to relax and for kids to play.  Small patch of great grass and big sandbox in kids area.  Parking by library limited, but much more available behind building.  Great grass in ball field.  Occasional seedy folks wandering around...as well as high schoolers looking for things to do.<//review>

<text>The management and staff are a bit rude and very cynical of the local and visiting community members, and to be honest, far to quick and open in sharing their condecending opinions, with or in front of young children. For a place that has the word community in its name, they could definitly use a proper demonstration of what it truly is to be a member of a community and how to keeps the one your familys live in, just that, communities.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I read the reviews before going and still decided to try it out because my friend goes there. Asked the guy for a 2 on the sides blended to the top. The dude didn’t even speak English and did a zero on the sides ( totally pissed me off) and then to top it off he didn’t even fade it! It was just a 4 on top and then zero around the sides, no blend at all. Please don’t go. It was super embarrassing on my date later that day</review>

For 7 years I have been comming and today I went and they said they can no longer serve me because I’m a girl? Gay? That doesn’t make sense . 7 years and no problems and I get this? A loyal customer and I can’t come because I’m gay?! This is crazy and horrible ! Wouldn’t recommend unless you want to be judge</text>

Person who answered the phone was VERY rude, for literally no reason at all. After trying it out, terrible experience and results. Would not recommened for any young male looking for decent haircut. Worst choie in Santa Ana.<//text>

Tried to ask the merced target to take it off and they told me I'd have to go to the place I purchased it. Well when I pulled up to the atwater target I realized I got this in Turlock. Called Turlock they offered to talk to them and the one working, I wish I got her name but she over heard and did it for me. I appreciate her so much she didn't put me through bunch of trouble< /Text>< Pictures>

This is how my family will be doing the bulk of our shopping. This is an easy  way to reduce exposure, and it's free for 6 months if you have a red card (which is also free). We ordered everything on the app, received cartwheel discounts, and picked it up within a couple of hours (which is probably less time than I spend in the actual store shopping). Also, I don't have to deal with the crowds and long lines! Highly recommend.</Text>

Typical Target. This is a super Target, so it has a grocery section. I can usually find what I need here. They also have a food court and a Starbucks. No photo center anymore, so I have to develop prints at Walmart next door. Service is usually pretty quick also.< /Review>

The eye center in Atwater CA is very cozy. Don't let this stop you from making an appointment to have your eyes checked. Friendly staff and a professional optometrist made the experience wonderful. I don't have vision insurance and they worked with me to receive a discount. Highly recommend.</review>

Customer Service is made a priority here. I never dread shopping because Target makes it so easy. With their cartwheel app shopping is as easy as search, select, checkout! Then it’s waiting for me at he store entrance or shipped directly to my home. Plus, they give all of their card holders an extra 5% every time they shop! My daughters are treated well, even if they have a melt down due to autism. They give them free cookies or fruit and pay when I bring in reusable shopping bags.</text>

<Review>I had gone looking for a kids umbrella & they sent me to place that there wasn’t. Then I asked again & they sent me towards the accessory section & there was only adult umbrellas. You guys should definitely get some.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
The Target pharmacy staff are GREAT.  They have been a great help with figuring our insurance problems.
The front $1-$3 area is a gold mine of things for the classroom.
The photo machines are easy it use.  The staff was great teaching me to how to get my pictures printed.< /Review>

<review>This staff is usually very helpful.
The ladies in the photo department are awesome.
Sometimes the stock in the clothing department is low.  That is something they could improve on.
The popcorn is so good we take extra home.
It is nice to have so much shopping so close to home.< /review>< Pictures>

For the most part, Target staff are amazing and well-trained in client relations, but there are a couple of items that the Atwater store used to carry that suddenly they don't anymore. Quality rotisserie chickens (they used to be good and now they are awful) and Litehouse Organic Ranch Dressing. :-(< /text>

Love this particular store. Everyone working is helpful and approachable. Cashiers tend to suggest deals and offer to swap products for you (instead of having to get out of line or just not buy it) if your items don't comply with a sale or WIC. Some of their prices are even better than its neighbor, Wal-Mart. Love this Target!< /review>

I bought a pretzel with cheese there, usually I don't buy them but my kids wanted some, so why not? Well it was awful. My 4 year old couldn't take a bite out of it. It was hard and stale. Disgusting.  Won't be buying food from there again.< /Review>

This is my regular store, it's ok. I get there on Sat mornings while the staff is stocking shelves.
The store manager Ali is an absolute pain. There was an issue with the doors one morning and I had to knock to get one of the 3 store personnel's attention. That didn't work and I was able to get in while someone was leaving. I told a member of staff and they told the store manager who lied to me and said they didn't hear me knock because they were busy cleaning. When she learned that I was right there the entire time and realized she was caught in a lie she said she was going to have store security throw me out. I don't need that
With service like this it is easy to see why people move to services like Amazon for their shopping.<//Text>

This is a super clean store.  They carry nearly everything you might need.  They are like the straight A student in that shopping center, and they have to settle with the embarrassment of having their drugged up, high school dropout Walmart directly next door.</text>

Used to enjoy going here but lately it's been horrible. ATM readers sometimes don't work!  Long lines, only a few registers opened. I ordered a few things online and expected them to be ready for pick up, y'know in and out, NOPE! Had to wait 30+ minutes because the assosiate kept saying my order was incomplete or something like that, only to be told the assosiate didn't scroll down on my order. VERY, VERY frustrating!< /Review>

Can't believe it's stayed so nice! Sometimes, it's cluttered and if I say something to management, it's picked right up, but it shouldn't get that way - ever! That's a clientele problem that this Target should stay on top of. Also, the produce and dairy sections are often empty like a third world country - probably because they are just Target people working there - not experienced/trained dairy and produce people. No excuse for not restocking and keeping up with "stock"! So, I go to Save Mart.<//Review>

Now... First look at this place and you'll think that's one small meat market.But once inside you'll be blown away when you realize that its actually bigger on the inside,and they sell some of the best Mexican food you can find!!! So if you're in the mood for some "bomb!" Tacos,burritos,tortas,chicken,carnitas,tripas,menudo,birria, and much more then you need to check this place out!!!!</Review>

(Translated by Google) I like the service of the very friendly butchers and good quality of meat and the staff at the excellent exchange house, plus nothing admiration for the matriarch of the Ruiz family. Doña Elvira. A hard-working lady and she does not expire.

<Review>Recently bought a used car from this place. We made it clear it would be a cash purchase. When we got there, the first thing they did was pull our credit score without authorization. Young salesman said he didn't know why either, as we spoke multiple times about method of payment. We tried to make a quick and painless transaction by asking for $300 off (from a $13k vehicle), either off the price or $300 more for our trade in, which was already on the extreme low end. Sales manager would not budge, even brought in another manager to insult the value of our vehicle and proceed to moan about his cost and how much they're losing on the vehicle. At some point it got annoying enough we actually had to walked out. They made the young salesman walked out to our vehicle to stop us from leaving the parking lot and accepted our offer. Why waste 2 hours of this nonsense? Throughout the whole process, even the finance guy taking payment was moaning about the sale. The games should be done with after agreeing to terms. Unreal...It gets tiring after 3-4 people whine and moan about how much they're losing money, or how hard it is to sell our trade-in (it's going to an auction). If the dealership is truly losing money on the sale, the used car manager needs to find another field of work. Never seen such lousy, unhappy and unprofessional employees, and I came from a Honda dealership. Actually felt bad for the young salesman (if the sales managers are willing to lose your sale/commission after all your hard work over so little value, find another dealership that'll treat you better). The next day we found out the back seat was incredibility stained, appeared it had been flooded or someone puked over it. Appears detail did try, but unable to remove it. Ultimately your customers should be happy after buying a car. Even after the unauthorized credit pull, the missed stained back seat, the one thing that really stood out was their piss poor attitudes. Instead of celebrating our purchase after signing all the paperwork, we just wanted to get the hell out of there. Really wished we didn't do business with this place. It's a shame to see such lack of professionalism in this field.<//Review></record>

<review>I would give them more stars if I could - really a great experience, start to finish.  And, although they had a limited (and masked!) staff, the entire purchase (lease) process was less than 30 mins.
What I really appreciated was them restructuring the standard 10k miles a year lease into 15k miles, them giving me KBB trade-in value on my car without prompting, and finalizing paperwork in the Finance Department on some state-of-the-art doc-u-sign device, which was built right into the desktop.  I also really appreciated the care and concern their product specialist took when going over the tech features with me after the sale; I believe his name was (is) Rafael, and he was perfection. ************* here are some more stars for you, Marin Honda - thank you!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Excellent customer service and great to work with! This was our 5th purchase or lease from Honda Marin. I called the sales rep and told him which car we were interested in and that we had some time constraints on the one day we could complete the purchase. He did all the upfront paperwork by the time we arrived. Quick and easy. Not as fast as a drive-thru, but pretty close! Would highly recommend!<//Review>< pictures>

It was easy to make an appointment and then there was a  review of the service status on the car. It was quickly decided what should be done and the car was worked on right away. The car was fixed quickly. Washed. And then I was on my way.  Christopher did a great job.<//text>

I called AGAIN about using my friends credit  They told me the credit card needed to be My name.  So I applied for a credit. Car, but it will take sometime to come.  When I called about changing the title into my friends name (as she has a credit card)  then I got Charlie who told me it was a miscommunication, and the credit card was only needed to rent a car.  So I went back in and Charlie made sure I had everything taken care id, and he was so kind.  I would give him 5 stars.  He was fantastic.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><rating>4</rating><Text>Waited in lounge while having an oil change. Efficient, professional in person customer service. Good adherence to social distancing in waiting lounge, employees wearing gloves and masks, and protective covering of driver's seat and steering wheel.

Their website has improved the ease of finding access to schedule service for my vehicle. No search was needed or click through of menu trees; a grid of options quickly popped out soon after I opened the site. Honda's online appointment setting is efficient for standard servicing.

But I have an old car that has less standard needs. In the past Marin's website was geared toward car sales. I couldn't find local phone numbers for their Parts and Service Departments. Once for an important big ticket system replacement, I left a voicemail on their sales number, never received a call back, and the service department knew nothing about my call and message. I never could talk directly with a knowledgeable person only a scheduler who did try to get information, and they didn't seem to review my online description of the less than standard servicing prior to the appointment. They had 3 business days between my scheduling and the appointment day. Very frustrating. Today's rating is for all several of my interactions so 3 stars.

Edited to 4 stars. Without my prompting Marin Honda offered and completed an install of a replacement part ordered on an old service bulletin that another dealer told us about yet didn't do it.</Text><gmap_id>0x80859af2e4fae24b:0xec1571935b2fa544<//gmap_id>< Name>

My tire pressure was showing low.   I tried filling it myself to no avail.  I called Marin Honda and was so relieved that they were open.  We had construction in our area and I was afraid I picked up a nail.   They had me come in for appointment that day.   No nail luckily!   But my tires checked and I was close to an oil change so I went for it.   I always find everyone I work with there so pleasant and competent.    And they even asked it for I’d like the car washed!   Have been using them for years and it’s always a positive experience.< /Review>

<review>I was impressed by the efforts and helpfulness of both the service representatives and the mechanics/technicians at Marin Honda.  My car was presenting with a very mysterious problem and the technician’s skills and diagnostic processes enabled them to get to the root of the problem and fix it completely.  The service representatives were very helpful in communicating updates and working with Honda to find helpful solutions while I waited for the work on my car to be completed. They were also very thoughtful and kind throughout the process.  Thank you to everyone who worked with me!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1583673345995, 'text': 'Jamie, thank you for letting us know that our team met your expectations.

<name>Thomas Carvalho</name>< review>
Took my 2016 Honda Civic here in 2019 because the AC stopped blowing cold while it was still under warranty. This was the second time it had happened which I told them.  First time was handled by another Honda dealer when I lived in another area.

I was told it was checked for leaks and while the freon was very low, there were no leaks. They refilled the Freon and performed a scheduled maintenance check.

A little over one year later my AC stopped blowing cold air again. I took it back to Marin Honda at which time they then found a leaky valve.

It is obvious that the leak had been there since I purchased the car as the freon had to be recharged every year but the leak was not detected the first time I took it to Marin Honda while under warranty.

They didn't own up to the fact that they missed it the previous time I took it in with the same problem and said it was a maintenance issue. I asked if the valve only lasts 1-3 years and got no answer.

Overall the gentleman that was working with me was pleasant, professional, and did try to help but they refused to own up to their mistake and I had to pay for it. I can't trust their service department and I will not be back.

*Update - The manager said to send my info and he would contact me to try to remedy. I sent my info. He never reached out. The dishonesty is worse than if they had just let it go. Can't trust this dealership.

AC is not working again after a year. Same thing as every spring. They never fixed it. There was a class action lawsuit which says there is a problem with the condenser for these cars. I'll take it to a different Honda dealer to see if they will agree to fix it under the extended warranty on these AC condensers. This dealership is not honest.< /review>

<review>Honda sent an email that maintenance should be scheduled.  I did.  It took less than an hour to get there to drop off the car and back to my office.  The shuttle driver called when he was about to pick me up for the return.  All went smoothly.  Again a quick turn-around.  All was clearly explained. Sara R was very helpful.

A few months ago we traded in and purchased a vehicle from Marin Honda.  We couldn't be happier with our purchase and experience.  I first contacted Marin Honda by phone when I noticed a car on their website.  They were very helpful over the phone and were prompt with the information I requested. Upon my arrival, they were very welcoming, professional, and helpful.  This goes for the entire team.  Even those that I wasn't dealing with were very kind and welcoming. I never felt pressured to buy which is not the experience that I've had at any of the other dealerships.  I was shopping for a car from my daughter and they really listened to my needs for her.   They were able to make a deal that worked for both the dealership and us. Even after the sale was done, they went the extra mile by spending time walking me through all the features of my new car.  They made me feel important and like the actually cared about finding the right car for my new driver.  Thank you so much for the amazing customer service, easy (and painless) transaction and for making us feel so welcome.  Your professionalism, kindness and knowledge was greatly appreciated.  I've already recommended your dealership to all of my daughters friends.  Thank you, Marin Honda!< /review>

This was our first experience ever buying a brand new car. We have always bought new-used. The experience was great. Everyone at the dealership was helpful, courteous and extremely professional. When we went to pick up the car, it was washed and ready to go.  The gentleman at the dealer spent time walking me through all the features and helped me set up the car play.  I would highly recommend Marin Honda if anyone is in the market to purchase a vehicle. This is now our second Honda Pilot and we love it!<//review>

Took my Element into Honda Service when it all of sudden sounded like a loud muscle car which it isn’t.  The tech quickly determined that someone had unsuccessfully tried to steal my catalytic convert.  The tech showed me a photo of the damage that was done, gave me several options on how to handle - I opted for the least expensive option and it worked great and saved me a lot of money.  I trust Honda Service to lay out all available options and explain the pros and cons of each.  From purchase to service I’ve never had a reason to regret having bought a Honda!</text>

<Text>This past week we were looking to replace an older Honda.  We had a good idea on what we wanted and had multiple options on where to purchase the new vehicle.   I reached out to Mike Atkinson at Marin Honda to inquire about the vehicle and he was quick to respond with great useful information.  As we were comparing vehicles at other dealerships and I asked questions, Mike was able to deliver the answers I needed.  By the time we were able to come in, Mike and his associate, Zach, were very friendly and courteous.  After test driving the vehicle and sitting down to go over the price, Mike was great to work with and we happily got the vehicle we wanted.  I highly recommend Mike and Zach and Marin Honda overall for your next vehicle purchase!<//Text>< pics>

The agent who helped me was courteous, efficient, friendly and knowledgeable.  The time and price were good and, overall, you couldn't ask for a better experience when needing a car repair.  Didn't use the shuttle this time, but I have in the past and that's a nice extra as well.  This time I waited in their clean and comfortable waiting area -- with free coffees and magazines to read  (although I brought my own Starbucks and book!)< /Review>< Pictures>

I had an issue with my car outside of normal service hours, and I didn't feel comfortable driving the ~50 miles home. I was stressing about what I was going to do.

I was able to get a hold of dealership management, and after explaining my concerns, they went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. I was already a fairly satisfied service department customer, but this experience reinforced that.

I also appreciate the technical knowledge of the service manager. I've worked on and around cars my whole life, and so I can tell when service department employees are phoning it in. This isn't the case here.

I will continue to go to Marin Honda for service on my Civic, without hesitation.</Text>

Went in for routine scheduled service.  Very well treated and the service was done promptly and I was kept informed of the progress.  They even washed my car for me!

I’ve had other vehicle brands in the past and the dealership service was nowhere near this level.

I would highly recommend this dealership.

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I rarely write reviews, but I recently took my Honda in to get a major service while visiting family, and I am very lucky to have had Sara as my advisor. After my car was (well) serviced, I was poking around under the hood that afternoon and noticed something I was unfamiliar with, so I called back to see if what I saw was normal, and just to be safe, Sara said I could bring the car back the following morning. I did, and Sara immediately called to a technician to help me. He drove my car to the garage and inspected it (and even showed me that everything was normal)... I just want to give her a shout-out for being so helpful and thoughtful. I would say people like this are hard to come by these days, and I'm just appreciative of everything.< /Review>< pics>

They pretend like they care about the customers of Marin and that they try their best to help the customer. But when I came here to get my Honda, they wanted to charge 17% interest rate through Redwood Credit Union and it was the best they could do. Went up to Santa Rosa and recieved a much lower rate through the same credit union. Disgusting to think that people in Marin take such terrible tactics to make more money.<//Text>

<Review>Outstanding service department.

I made an appointment, got there about 15 minutes early, and the place was busy. Despite that, I was helped by a friendly porter almost immediately, given a claim ticket and went inside to the service writer.

Simon G was just finishing up with a client but acknowledged me with a warm “good morning” and “I’ll be right with you.”

A minute later, Simon and I reviewed what my Civic needed and gave me a time estimate, and options for the shuttle, waiting area, etc.

The car was ready half hour early, and Simon reviewed the transaction and potential areas of concern I should be aware of going forward.

Thank you Marin Honda!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I Was originally looking for a used vehicle but ended up upgrading to a 2019 because of all of the wonderful features Mila (Sales lady) described. The manager was super nice and I felt he gave me a good deal. The staff was very friendly and the show room was clean. The gentleman in the finance department was very informative and had a wonderful sense of humor. The service technician that explained how the car operates was very detailed and I was super grateful because I’m not as tech savvy as I thought! 😂 I most definitely would refer friends or family to purchase at Marin Honda.< /review>< pics>

Service ok. Shuttle service was terrible. If you’re busy or need to be picked up at a certain time don’t rely on their shuttle service. I called in at11:50 am to pick up my car which would be done around 12:15. Got a call at 1:45 saying he would be able to pick me up in 30 minutes. Next time I’ll just wait in lounge to save 3 extra hours.</Review>

< Review>
I got a flat tire on my way home from SF to Santa Rosa, on the freeway, on Christmas Eve afternoon, in the rain. As you might imagine, I was really worried about what to do. It was so amazing that I was able to get to Marin Honda - they were still open, although it was about an hour before they were closing. They made sensible recommendations for me, made my husband and I comfortable while we waited, and had the car fixed and ready for us to drive home, just minutes before they closed for Christmas. The service advisor guy I dealt with, Leo, was excellent!< /Review>

<text>Service at Marin Honda is a real pleasure.  Check-in is streamlined very efficiently. The staff are competent, helpful and friendly.  The waiting room is comfortable and has free coffee, lattes, cappochinos, tea, etc. sometimes I walk across the street to shop at Target or Home Depot. You can also get a ride home and back if you don’t want to wait.  I like that you get a free car wash with any service.<//text>< pics>

<text>I came into the Honda Dealership not knowing what I wanted. I was greeted by very nice gentleman named Alli. He greeted me with great enthusiasm and kindness walking me through Honda store. When I first came in I just wanted to come in and look but I never imagined buying a car. He asked me about my interests and what type of car I was looking for.  After I told him the parts for my ideal car, he introduced me to the new Honda Civic. He gave me a tour of the car, talking about the specs, and some newer features. He was very impressive always exhibiting positive body language, being very understanding to my needs and ultimately making me comfortable in my first car buying experience. He was very patient with me and I never felt pressured. I also went to other dealers before but this experience in Marin Honda was very different. I felt as if I was brushed aside from other dealers because I was just starting to buy my first car, but Alli really worked with me and understood me. I am grateful Marin Honda has a good salesman like Alli. I recommend Marin Honda for anyone who wants to buy a new car. We sometimes still talk today. He asks me about how I am doing and whether if I am enjoying the car.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1461508476663, 'text': "Alsan,\n\u200b\n\u200bWe're so happy to hear you had such a great experience with Alli.

This was my first time getting my  2008 Honda Civic serviced here, was a very good experience, Donna handled the whole service for me, I went for the 'B service' because I wanted my brakes checked as well.  There were some issues that were discovered, one of which had been an issue since I had purchased the car from a family member.  This issue was resolved by the mechanic that day (from start to finish, about 5.5hrs to get an inspection, oil change, and some significant repairs and a battery replacement done) which I was very happy with upon getting my car back and experiencing the difference while driving. There is wifi and a lounge area provided and also a shuttle service which was a nice touch for people to be able to do things in nearby towns while their cars were being serviced.  Overall the experience was great, my car runs much better, the cost was reasonable, I was communicated to about everything that was being done.  I would definitely recommend this dealership for their service dept.</Text>

Had a very positive experience here this past weekend. Our salesman Naoki Takahashi was very informative and helpful in my car buying experience. He answered all my questions regarding the car or warranty. Any he didn't know, he stated that he wasnt 100% sure and would get the answer. It was a very honest answer and definitely made me more comfortable in my experience shopping. I was in and out in less than two hours from walking the lot of cars to walking out with keys. Kept me updated throughout the entire experience as well. Thank you so much Naoki!<//review>

Simon was and always is so attentive to my car- my frequency of visits ( I drive an extraordinary amount) which always puts him at a higher focus- so very thorough and helpful and super intelligent about cars. He manages the cost closely and even this visit found a few indescrepencies such as Email blocked which he corrected and cost was also a few dolllars off. Examplary customer service and even washed my car without asking me to wait an inordinate amount of time. It was a true delight to work with him. You have a jewel in your core team.< /Review>

The guy who helped me today name was Nick and he was awesome with calling and texting with the progress of my vehicle. I really appreciated that he had the shuttle wait for me until i was done checking my car in for service. Overall excellent experience. I would come back.</text>

Approaching 600,000 miles driving Hondas purchased and serviced at Marin Honda.
There are two reasons for my loyalty. Quality of product and service.

It started with my first purchase at Marin Honda. The salesman was informative and patient. I believe that it was the third trip back when I decided to purchase my first Honda - a 1991 Hatchback.

My thanks to Marin Honda’s entire staff. You make driving a worry-free pleasure.

< Review>
Oscar helped me today and he was great. He immediately tried to work with me and the requests that I had for price and mileage. I left with a new car (2015) but very grateful and thank you Oscar for taking the time to help me find what I wanted! They also are very welcoming for coming back to get serviced and detailed. The only problem is that they made it seem like I still had a warranty then at signing said it was only an engine warranty and then my payment went up only a couple dollars because I added a 5 year warranty.<//Review>

Hector was great. Was very knowledgeable about all the models. I especially appreciated the no pressure approach in us finally selecting our new car.<//review>

Getting my Honda civic hatchback was truly an amazing experience. The deal was too good to be true. Nayan and Ramin at Marin Honda made it way easy and even found me a better rate than anyone else. Its hard to beat the deal and options these guy presented to us. A big thank you guys!< /Text>

The only problem I have with the service department is with the physical layout of the place.
You drive your car into line.  That’s Never a problem.
An employee comes over to check mileage, welcome you, and place a numbered card on your dash.  Great.
Then you walk into a room where the service reps are doing their thing.  There are 3-5 people sitting right in front of you dealing with paper work, talking on the phone, talking with a customer, or doing Lord knows what. And you stand there waiting to be summoned.  This is an awkward situation.  It would be better if you had room for a small waiting room area.<//text><name>Rick Budde<//name>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I have had nothing but the most amazing experience leasing my Honda Accord at Marin Honda, thanks to Freddy Hernandez. He has gone above and beyond and made this entire process a dream. He made sure I understood everything from beginning to end and walked me through the entire process step by step. He got me the exact car i wanted and has personally been involved in all aspects of the lease. He has been available to answer all my questions along the way, even after I drove my car off the lot. I couldn’t have done it all without him! Thank you Freddy!!!<//Text></record>

I was shopping for a Lexus ct200h and they happened to have a great one on their lot with all the specs I was looking for (they appear to be one of the most thriving dealerships in Marin with so much business and inventory). Oscar Perez was the sales advisor who helped me with my purchase and it went quickly, flawlessly, and he made sure I was advised on every last detail and even made sure the car was perfect before I drove it off the lot. I HIGHLY recommend Marin Honda and specifically Oscar Perez if you're in the market for a new or used vehicle.

I had never visited this Honda dealership before, but I needed a minor repair on my Honda SUV. They were able to fit me in without an appointment (on a Saturday!) and I was given the full VIP treatment, free coffee, free shuttle ride, and my bill was less than estimated. Sara was absolutely great and communicated everything from start to finish, she even called me an Uber when the shuttle was taking too long. No this isn't a phony review! I was very impressed!</text>

We bought our Odyssey Minivan here and originally feared and dreaded the car buying process!  You always here stories of the sleazy car salesman ripping people off.  Well, the car buying experience at Marin Honda was probably the best buying experience we have ever had!  Justin the show room manager really put us at ease and gave us every fact we wanted and needed about the car.  He took special steps to educate us about the safety of the Odyssey because he knew we had small children and safety was a top priority.

Once we decided on model and color of the vehicle it was time for price.  We mad an offer that we were comfortable with.  We became nervous again because we knew there would be a "back and forth negotiating period."  Enter Shawn H., the general sales manager.  We told Shawn we had done our homework and felt we put in a reasonable offered.  He agreed--- but TOLD US THERE WAS ALSO A SPECIAL REBATE SO HE COULD GIVE US AN ADDITIONAL $2K OFF FROM THE PRICE WE WANTED!  What??  Really???  Shawn, did you just tell us you were going to sell us the car $2k below what WE OFFERED YOU??? Who does that??  Apparently the folks at Marin Honda do that and that's why we have just become lifetime customers!< /text>

Everyone has an off day, so today, as frustrated as I was today at the service center, I can't truly give a 1 star review.  When someone tells me over and over that they don't care, I tend to believe them.  But retaliating with a 1 star review is not fair to the other employees.  At the end of the day my car was serviced.  They forgot to do one thing, but I dare not go back in after the fiasco that didn't seem to want to go away!  A driver couldn't come and get me at 11:10 am due to being out to lunch.  The service center was kind enough to send an Uber, but sent it to the wrong address and the Uber couldn't come to where I was, so I walked.  Lol, cooled me down in this warm weather.  As a manager in a professional world, I understand off days.  What I don't understand is no one wanting to take ownership.  It wasn't about the $$, everything was about the poor service that I received this day.  And to the person who asked, yes, I would honor a competitor's special especially if I knew I would gain their future business and that person would not walk away frustrated!!  :)  I am disappointed because this was my first time at this center, I always had excellent service at Folsom Lake Honda!<//review>

<Text>Judging from how hard it is to get the attention of a sales person, they probably do a large volume of sales, so you may be able to get a deal. I can't confirm because the sales person we finally we assigned didn't have a clue about the car we wanted or the options available.

Buying a car has never been high on my list of favorite things to do on a weekend but I have to say that Hector (and the rest of Marin Honda) exceeded my expectations for being easy to deal with, informed and willing to do whatever was necessary to make sure I got what I wanted. Not once did the process feel forced, uncomfortable or awkward. This is my 3rd Honda. I got my last one here (2005) and chances are I’ll get my next one here as well. Thanks to everyone involved.< /Review>

I owned a 1996 Honda Civic for 20 years. When the time came to buy a new one, I went to Marin Honda. Marin Honda was flexible on price, great on financing and stellar on efficiency. It took less than 1.5 hours from the moment I met my sales person (Gustave) to driving off the lot in my new 2015 Honda Civic. As far as car buying goes, Marin Honda was a great experience!<//Text>

Our life is so busy that it was not until Thanksgiving evening that we discussed the need for a new Accord as ours had over 200,000 miles on it. We immediately emailed Jim Hughes at Marin Honda. We truly did not expect a reply as it was a holiday, but we received a prompt response and met with Mr. Hughes the next day. As a result, we purchased a brand new Accord and are extremely happy. Mr. Hughes is personable, knowledgeable, and professional. We enjoyed our time with him and are extremely happy with our purchase and the experience that we had with the personnel at Marin Honda. Jakov led us through the finance paperwork. He is a pleasant and knowledgeable young man.  It was a great experience to have purchased our car by Mr. Jim Hughes of Marin Honda. Will recommend your dealership to friends and family.<//Review>

Everyone I met at the dealership was very friendly and thorough with me.  They treated me with respect and didn't go through any mind-games and roundabouts that other dealerships in the area engages in at the dealership.  The price promised before I arrived were kept by James, who was very professional and friendly.  When we left the dealership we walked out with a great car in Civic and we would love to come back to this dealership specifically even if it's a haul from the city, because we had such a good experience overall.  I would sincerely highly recommend Marin Honda to my friends and family for many years in the bay area.</Text>

< Review>
Rarely do I write a review about a business unless the full experience is exceptional – and this is definitely one of those times. I spent a month comparing 5 dealerships (through phone and email) for the best lease deals being offered on Honda Civics and none even came close to prices at Marin Honda.
The next challenge was to find a place where I would be treated fairly as a female having limited knowledge about cars. My experience was AMAZING. The team I worked with were fabulous. My sales person was Hector Gonzalez – he was very knowledgeable with the Civics I was considering and very patient with my cuzillion questions. More importantly, I (the solo female shopper) was treated with complete respect and made to feel totally comfortable during the whole process. Justin, the Manager, was so great to work with and I definitely know I was given the best deal possible on my lease. Yakov was my contact finance person to take care of the paperwork needed and the process was accurate and honest (and painless). Hector was/is doing follow-up on every step of the process through and beyond the final sale. I had leather seats added to the car and they look amazing.
I would 110% recommend Marin Honda to everyone. As for me, it’s ZOOM ZOOM  down the road in my new car enjoying the smell of leather and listening to great tunes – and smiling!!! THANK YOU MARIN HONDA!!!</Review>

<review>(Owner asked me on this post to email him so I did and he hasn't responded. Clearly not interested in resolving only public image.)

We did not buy a car here so I can't comment on the purchasing process. My frustration comes with feeling like we were misled over the phone. I had been in contact with someone from their internet sales department (I won't mention their name out of respect for them) over a 2 day period. We live a 3 hour drive away but have a small flight that flys from our town to SF. We let the sales rep know that we would try to fly in on Sunday morning to look at the car. The night before the rep called me and said they would "set it aside and have it ready for us in the morning." We were not able to get on the first flight of the day and had to wait for the 2nd flight of the day for seats. I called at 9:30 before they opened and they confirmed, "We have it set aside and we are ready for you." When my wife arrived in SF they told us they had sold it while she was in the air!!

Then when we talked with them they said it's illegal to hold cars and they couldn't hold it. The rep even told me he said that before we left which i disagreed with and said I took, "We have set it aside and have it ready," to mean they were holding it. I would never have wanted them to break a law but rather to have been more up front and clear with what they meant with their statements before my wife and son boarded a flight to SF. They did offer us another car for what they said their lowest price would be as an apology but we didn't like the color enough to pay what they still wanted.

All of that to say I have learned that a dealer will not hold a car even if what they are saying sounds like they will, thats on me. My advice to Marin Honda is that you be more clear when you are talking with people who are going through great lengths to travel to your dealership to purchase a car from you. Clarity of communication is valuable and could have saved my family quite a bit of trouble today.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Buying my Honda Accord was A very nice experience for me due to James Johnson that answered all of the many questions I had about cars and help me find the right car ; then he helped me to understanding the security features, the electronic devices and gadgets in the car and taught me how to use them. He had patience and kindness, even after the car was sold he kept helping me.
So I will recommend him because it made a huge difference after spending time at other dealers.< /text></record>

We went to Marin Honda, thinking we would likely get a CRV but wound up liking the new, 2015 FIT instead. The salesman, Eugene Valencia, was great. He explained all the features, let us  test drive it and answered all our questions. Our interactions with Eugene, his supervisor and the finance manager were all great. They went out of their way to ensure we were happy. Eugene has followed up with me a few times since we bought it to see if we had any questions or needed anything. A very good experience and we would definitely go back next time we need a new car.<//review>

<username>Aqil Bassa</username><Text>This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a car dealership. After already test driving a Jeep, and knowing that I either wanted a wrangler or a type r, I came here to drive a civic (not necessarily the type r) so that I could make my final decision. I came to the dealership with cash in my pocket ready to purchase a new car, but was not taken seriously by any means. When I asked to take a car on a test drive I was told that I would not be able to do that until I was about to sign and buy the car. After coming from a dealership that had asked me if I wanted to drive a new hellcat just for fun I found it odd that this dealership would not even let me start up a car. After standing around the cars inside for 5 minutes and not being helped at all I knew that I would not be purchasing a car from this dealership. As I was leaving one of the employees pointed to a corner of the lot and told me that I could find more cars there. This had been the first dealership that I went to where rather that showing me what I was looking for, they sent me on a wild goose chase.

I came to this dealership because it's close to home, but after experiencing such horrible service I have no problem driving somewhere else to get my car. It seems they think just because there's money in Marin county they don't need to actually help customers.</Text><gmapID>0x80859af2e4fae24b:0xec1571935b2fa544</gmapID><resp>{'time': 1536618091703, 'text': 'Hello Aqil,\n\nPlease rest assured that I take your feedback very seriously and would like the opportunity to learn more about your visit with us to look at a Honda Civic.

<review>Today I experienced something to restore some of my (damaged) faith in human-kind:

My family bought a low-mileage certified Honda Insight from Marin five months ago. Marin received us late that day with tired children in tow, and stayed nearly two hours past regular closing time to complete our sale. The sales and financial people were sweet, courteous, and uncomplainingly worked overtime with us.

In those five months since, we put just over four-thousand miles on the car.
Last Sunday, I noticed that the front tires had prematurely and unevenly worn- to the point that they were nearly bald. Knowing this could be because of alignment or suspension, I called Marin. They asked me to bring it in the next day.

Here is where I fully expected to encounter baulking of some kind, and that I would have to argue the point of any misalignment as being responsible for the tire wear; in my head circulated tedious scenarios of letter-writing and explanation that I would have to undergo for some satisfaction, as the auto dealers I had encountered in the past fell under worse stereotypes of the profession.

Arriving at 9:30AM and explaining that I had to be back in the East Bay area to pick up my children from school, they prioritized my car. Still uneasy, I settled in the lounge with a free cappuccino and my book, thinking I would be there until the estimated 1:PM completion.
At 11:AM I was called to take my car.
They'd found and repaired the alignment issue and installed new tires at no charge to me. No argument, no hassle, pleasant, civilized, responsible, prompt- my God, what a relief! I'm so pleased- our experiences with Marin Honda have been some of the best we've had with any kind of business, ever.
Thanks, guys!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1400889848943, 'text': 'Brian, Thank you for the positive review of our sales and service department!

My daughter just bought her first car, a new Civic, from Marin Honda.  Salesman was L James Johnson.  Mr. Johnson treated my daughter very well.  He clearly knows a great deal about the cars he is selling and explained the options and features patiently and completely.  The price my daughter paid was, in my opinion, very fair.  No silly selling tactics like those that my daughter encountered at other dealerships.  (It was these ridiculous tactics that prompted me to come up from Southern California to provide moral support.  To be very clear, Mr. Johnson dealt with my daughter and not with me.)  I can't say enough good things about how well this went!</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I recently purchased a 2010 Honda Insight at the Marin Honda Dealership and had a great experience in working with their staff there.

I had made an appointment originally with Jim Hughes to test drive a car and instead had the pleasure of working with Brent Miletich, due to Jim's day off.

Meeting Brent with my co-worker, Nadine, was a very positive and fun experience for me!

In meeting and working with Brent to assist me in financing a car with a Capital One Auto Loan, Brent was very detailed and diligent about working with my numbers and the criteria for Capital One Loan.  I felt very “impressed” by his knowledge and secure knowing that I had a person that is going to get me right car for me!  On top of that, he’s a funny guy! :)

Brent also introduced us to his finance colleague, Jacob Whitfield.  Jacob was also professionally positive to work with.  :)

Overall, it took me two days to work with Brent and his crew at Marin Honda and I drove away with a car that I’m very excited to drive!

I would recommend that if you are in that moment of life to purchase a new or used car, you will have a fun, pleasant and very professional experience in working with Brent Miletich and Jacob Whitfield! :)

Thanks for ALL the help that I received at Marin Honda!  I’ll see you guys soon…..

Nayan was super helpful and I'm overall very happy with my experience; I got the car I have been wanting for several years at a very fair price, he and the rest of the team were not pushy or sketchy like many dealerships can come across, everything was very straight-forward, no games and no last minute changes. I would recommend Nayan, the team, and Marin Honda to a friend and I couldn't be more happy with my new car. Thanks!<//text>

<review>We traded our 2011 Odyssey for 2012 Pilot. We wish we could keep the Odyssey as well but can't afford 2 payments :-) We needed an SUV (4WD) to support our outdoor lifestyle.

We drove by Marin Honda to check their inventory as they have the most Pilots at that time and found Touring edition that my wife liked. I have priced my Odyssey high (hoping that dealer would say no) but they got the best value for my trade-in. Sales are easy to talk with and they meet the requirements I set forth before I started negotiation that I have this much of budget and stick with it until we had a deal. Took us almost closing as we have arrived in the dealership late already but I would say it was well worth the trip.

Had to mention, James Johnson of Sales and Jeremie Macias of Finance - great job!<//review>< pictures>

We came in with the car in mind that we wanted to see. Our last car was a lease from the same dealership.  I don't think we will be buying a car here. After we started working with one salesman, a second came over who was very aggressive.  His first words to us were, "what are you trying to do here?" He was aggressively trying to talk us out of the car we wanted and into another car that we were not very excited about.  They spent only a few minutes talking about features and the rest of the time rummaging around in the back room with each other doing god-knows-what.  His recommendations were not bad, but his demeanor was just very aggressive, sort of like he was drinking too much coffee.< /text>

<text>They don't take the "make an offer" seriously. I made an offer the e-mail reply said " its good" than when I talk to the rep over the phone on the car than they turn around and told me that it can not be done. For Such a big dealership.

These sale associates don't give a full evaluation of the car so beware. The first time they sent me home with a civic with a misaligned trunk and refused to trade it the next day after until they realized that the bin number they registered was also incorrect. They let me trade my car, but after a few weeks the sun visor (which never had been used because of the weather) popped right off. I would add on more about the terrible experience I had before purchasing the car, but I wouldn't have room. Please go somewhere else and get a better experience and deal rather than wasting your time and money here.< /Text>

Just drove by to see if they have any mini van. Didn't have Honda Odyssey in mind. Mo, the sales representative taking care of us, was very professional, friendly and helpful. He listened what we were looking for and came up with suggestions. There was no sales pressure, just convincing sales suggestions and arguments (that I do expect). A fair price, good financing and professional appeal closed the deal on a Honda Odyssey that I didn't even have on my horizon. I'm very happy with my purchase and the business experience with Mo Aimaq (sales), Jeremie Macias (financing) and Marin Honda. Thank You.<//Text>

Drove the car and decided I loved it, after driving a lot of other cars which all had some major compromise. The Pilot is fantastic, great fit for me and my family.

We were able to quickly agree on a price for both my trade and the car by looking online at the current value, and after some quick additional negotiations a deal was made. Great selection, so the next few minutes was deciding on a color while my salesman Shawn prepped the paperwork. By far the fastest, BS-free buying experience I've ever had with a car dealership. The place is nice too, large and comfortable, so the next day while I was having some factory racks installed I was able to work remotely on their reasonably fast wi-fi connection. Doesn't get much better than that and I'm prone to a strongly antagonistic relationship with car salesmen in general. Highly recommended.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80859af2e4fae24b:0xec1571935b2fa544<//gmapID></record>

<Text>What a joke. The standard used car salesman experience when attempting to get a brand new lease. I test drove a new Honda Civic hatchback today. The salesman, Boden, asked for the keys to my car without telling me why; I asked and he said to get my mileage, which I then provided. Then he asked me the make, model, etc of my trade-in. Mazda CX-5. He came back with a paper for me to sign before I could get a quote. I looked at the paper and it said Kia Optima with a weird VIN number, and I refused to sign. He said they had to run my lease to factor in my payments and couldn’t do so without my signature; I provided the lease amount and shockingly, that was sufficient. I have been driving for almost 20 years and never had to sign a piece of paper to get a quote prior. Then the game began- he went back to his manager, to ask about the price. After 20 minutes and a few pointed looks, they came out and quoted me MSRP. When I explained that I’d be happy to pay a certain amount over invoice, and asked to see invoice, Steve, the manager said “I can show you the invoice but I won’t sell it to you for that price.” Then he stuck out his hand, and said some version of “well in order to get to that price I would have to take $5,000 off, so I guess that’s that.” So you’re not willing to negotiate or discuss discounts, and essentially asked me to leave. I said that, and he said “that’s your perception.” Really? Again, a joke. These are the reasons I’ve decided to go elsewhere; it’s 2018 and the car buying experience shouldn’t make me feel like I’m stuck in 1995.<//Text><Time>1516160482617<//Time><Rating>2< /Rating><UserId.>113760797242465178819</UserId.><username>Jason Rubino< /username>< response>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>We negotiated for a particular vehicle over email and text and Nayan invited us to come into the dealership to finish the deal at the first possible moment that he was free.  I mentioned that I had newborns and that I didn't want to drive over until we had a deal.  We drove an hour with newborns.  He made us wait after our scheduled time, then he said he'd go get the car, then he came back saying that it was out for a test drive, then he came back saying it was sold.  We left the dealership after this terrible experience directly into rush hour traffic.  When I pointed out that this was a bad customer experience to Nayan, he said "It's your fault sir"  I recommend dealing with him with caution.<//Text>< Pictures>

I and my wife want a fresh experience when dealing with buying car.  I live in Richmond and was a loyal customer of El Cerrito Honda since we bought our house in 2010 and got screwed from our last purchase in 2013 with high rate of interest 5.99% 73 mos only after a few days with initial offer 0.9% 36 mos and 1.9% 60 mos and the new car had 115 miles on it.  In July 2015, My intention was to buy the new HR-V red color, came in to see only one white available at Honda of El Cerrito.  I changed the salesman and got pushed back to deal with my original saleswoman. I decided to switch the dealer at Marin Honda.  It is more convenient for my wife because she worked at Home Depot next door.  She can drop off her car for maintenance and pick up after work.  We came in and got time to look around without pressure, the price was good and no dealing required.  That is the way it should be.  When I purchased my first car at Honda El Cerrito, the Marin Honda was under construction.  If I could go back in time, I would make the deal like this purchase.  My deal should be fast and simple.  Thank you for this experience.</Text>

<text>If you want to avoid a head ache please don't go to Marin Honda. They took forever to process my loan and when I finally received my statement to make my first payment my account was past due.

Brought my Honda in for a door lock recall they fixed the Issue but left me with a new one. I am not a mechanic so I have to trust that them when they say the new lock issue Im having is unrelated to the old issue. Who knows, stranger things have happened but the way I was spoken to, complete with eye rolls from the customer service department guarantees I won't be coming here again for the new Honda I'm getting ready to buy. Seems fairly short sighted way to do business for a $90.00 fix....<//Review>

Came down at Marin Honda for my 2003 Honda Civic EX. Honda's run forever and I'm impressed by the professionalism of the service staff. I was greeted with smiles and felt like a million bucks. On my way out, I passed by Arisamand Pahuwattanakorn, who said he has the same car as mine - except his is manual. He told me he did the oil change for my car and was very kind. We had a nice chat and then off to enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you Arisamand and Marin Honda for a great experience! Will recommend others and come back.<//review>

< review>
Car buying experence was great, especially Mike Atkinson, he understood I was a woman on the run and made everything very fast and easy for me. Thank you for that Mike!! The problem didn't occur until I had a problem with the car less than a week of my purchase. I purchased the Honda Crosstour on 05/26/2017, first thing I noticed was the car was filthy in the inside!! Outside looked wonderful. Yes, carpets were cleaned but the previous owner had a major spill and you can sure tell, I think I killed about 20 ants coming out of the emergency brake area within the first 2 days.. finally I sprayed Raid and let it sit over night.  But all the other sticky stuff in rails of seats, sides of seats, middle compenants, inside of all compartments should of been caught!! Now for the problem that brought me to write this review which I never do.  So starting from the moment I purchased car I've heard a Metallic sound when I drive up hills , maybe something to do with tail pipes.  I finally called the service department on 06/02/2017 to see what type of new car warranty they had , he had asked me did I purchase  one , I told him yes but that's besides the point, I just purchased car and shouldn't have to use the $3000.00 extnded warranty I JUST PURCHASED! He told me i cold bring it in.. or take it to nearest Honda dealer.  That didn't sit well wit me I called back next day , pretty much got same answer, I told him I wanted to speak to a Manager, he forwarded me to I believe the name was Justin Shielling ? Anyhow I left a long message with my conern and asked what I should do.. no response yet and it is 06/10/2017.  I get speedy responses prior to car purchase, but not after... hmmmm. I don't want months to go past and they put the problem on me... and it may not event be a huge propblem!!< /review>

<Review>We called on Thursday and made an appointment with a salesperson to.come see a very specific car he said they had. On Saturday, our appointment day, we called in to confirm the appointment and make sure car was still there to find out it was sold.  The salesperson ne er called to let us know it was sold and we would have see driven a long distance.  If they couldnt hold the vehicle and not sell it to anyone, they could've told us that.  We wouldve tried to make it in earlier. This was very unprofessional and such a huge disappointment.< /Review><date>1454182893504<//date></record>

<Review>I am out of state buyer from Portland, Oregon who purchased a 2015 Lexus RC350. I first contacted Mike Atkinson of internet sales back on June 28th. Buying process was smooth at first, I placed a $1000 deposit with my credit card to secure the sale. Car was as described and delivered to me on July 12th. Communication and everything was great until it came to getting the title. I sent Marin Honda a cashier's check for $41,500 over 30 days ago and still have yet to receive my title and 2nd key fob as of July 29th. Kept getting excuse after excuse after excuse. First, they were missing 1 document that needed to be signed. Then another document that needed to be signed... then another document. This happened 3 times.  Mike kept saying that they do not do a lot of out-of-state but this is getting old. So many excuses that it made me dizzy. Every time I received a phone call, it was because of another 'issue' or missing document that needed to be signed. Very unprofessional and unorganized. I feel like I was getting the run-around. It should not take 17 days to get the documents together to get me the title that should have been sent as soon as they have my payment. Very frustrated. Spoke to a Manager named Shawn today. He promised to call me back in a few hours, yet, that did not happen. If this is how a customer that paid $42,500 for a car is treated, I could not imagine what would happen to a customer paying less.

Today was the second time that I took our odyssey to Marin Honda for service and got a new second ding on the front of the bumper. The first time the drivers door was damaged by possibly being slammed into the lift. That issue was taken care of. This time the service advisor Viktor said that the ding was already there when I dropped off the van when in fact it wasn't. This is so frustrating that your mechanics are so irresponsible and not being careful not to damage the cars. Wonder if it's just my luck with Marin Honda, or there are others. You lost my business for sure! I will never take the van to your service department. Besides the ding damage, the service advisor did not take my conserns seriously and most of the issues I listed were not taken care of.

I received a call from Marin Honda to meet with Brook, the general manager on 8/4/16 and resolve the issue regarding the damage done to the front bumper during the service on 7/28/16. We have scheduled to meet at 12:30PM.  I got to Marin Honda at 12:30PM and one of the sales men went to Brook’s office to let him know that I am here waiting for him.  After 15min the same sales man came by and acted like he did not see Brook and that he will page him. At 1:00PM I stepped outside and decided to call the main number and ask for Brook.  The receptionist transfer me to Brooks extension and guess what, he answered. He asked if I was late and that he was waiting for me at 12:30PM. He had also asked if I already left.  I said no, I am still at the dealership.  He responded that he is coming out to meet me.  When we met, I showed him the van with the damage done to the front bumper.  The bumper has a dent impression, scratch and ripped plastic protector I had in place.  Brook gave me a look like I am crazy coming back regarding this and that this is something that was noted by the service department during the drop off, when in fact this damage was not present during the drop off on 7/28/16.
Brook then offered me a bottle of touchup paint and saying that he will not refinish the bumper.  I reconfirmed that if he is asking me to apply the touchup to the ripped plastic protector over the dent? He just looked and did not reply. At that point I told him that this is total waste of time.  I left the dealership. Brook called back in 15min suggesting coming back the next day so his guys can apply the touch up.  I asked how you can apply the touchup on a dented, scratched bumper with ripped plastic protector? He replied with that’s all I can do.  Well, if your techs are able to damage the vehicles during service, you should be able to fix the damage as it supposed to be fixed.
Typical sales wolfs.  The only time they will be nice and helpful is when you are overpaying while buying a vehicle from them.  This is the worst experience I ever had with a dealership.  I own a Lexus and previously owned BMWs. Service at both is much more superior to Honda.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I will service the van only in a local shop from now on. It will be cheaper and without damage done during the service.< /Text>

Just a note to say thanks to Kamal and Yakov,
I spoke with them via internet about the 2012 Chrysler 200 you had available. They set up a time for me to view the vehicle during my off hours. Even as busy as they were with the big sale of the weekend they made sure i was well taken care of and was able to driver home in my new car.
Thank you<//text>

Sells a 2014 used Honda CR-V with dirty oil. Had to do an oil change right away. The woman who finalizes the sale and tries to sell you $1500 service warranty makes racist comments; doesn't apologize when called out on it. Yuck.<//Text>
