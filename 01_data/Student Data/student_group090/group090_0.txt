<Review>I called ahead of time just to make sure they still had the SUV that was advertised online because it was 1 hour 45 min drive for me. The lady that answered the phone said “yes we still have it and we close at 6:30” so I drove out there and arrived an hour before closing. As I walked up to the small lot, I didn’t see the car so I asked the 2 guys that worked there standing out front where it was. They both had no idea what I was talking about so I showed them on my phone. Then one tells the other in spanish “oh the one that he drives". He then calls whoever’s driving it to tell them I wanted to see it. Then he tells me “oh sorry he’s driving it right now, come back Monday” WOW very unprofessional and unorganized. Would never do business with someone like this.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1596582517409, 'text': 'Marciano, we are very sorry for the way in which things played out on Saturday evening.

< review>
We were very lucky to find Rigo's Auto Sales. We had already tried a number of other options and were turned off by the sales culture at the other shops.

Rigo's is family owned and operated and you can tell as soon as you start talking to the employees. Carla took great care of us and I feel we got a fair deal.

Thanks Rigo's!<//review>

Rigo’s is a great place to purchase a vehicle. They were all very helpful and even with no credit they worked with me to purchase my first car. Carla is a lot of help and she’s very caring and takes the time to explain everything thoroughly so you can understand. I recommend to come here if you want to purchase a vehicle. :)<//text>

(Please note, this review was created by both, Greg Anderson and Weldon Browne)
Rigo and Rigo Jr. together, form an unbeatable team.  Rigo Sr manages the sales location while Rigo Jr. manages the service location.  These guys are reinventing the auto industry with their own style of integrity, fairness and great pricing.  Based on my own experience with these two operations, I highly recommend them to anyone buying or servicing a used car.  I had a problem with my credit rating caused by an injury I sustained a few years ago.  Rigo Sr. helped me get the loan I needed to buy my car.  Years later when a major engine part failed at 200,000 miles, Rigo Jr. repaired it for half the cost of all other quotes.  I cannot say enough good things about these gentlemen.  Good at what they do and they sincerely want to ensure your satisfaction.<//Review>

<Review>It was off to what seemed like a great start. He talked us up a big game about giving us the best deal and although it is a used car dealership and you sign to take car as is, you would think the owner would wanna give a decent car to the person who is paying him money for it.

Then after we locked in the contract, we started to see how deceptive he was and how much work the car needed. He even tried to pass as helpful in the beginning because he came to drop me off when he checked out an electircal problem the car was having but when he said he fixed it, we later found out that he just slapped a band-aid on it and tried to convince us it was fixed.

Then when he said we would be he first he would service when the part came in that could fix the problem, there was no follow up and nothing got fixed. But of course the day we are one day late with a payment, phone ring off the hook.

So after being fed up with putting up with bs, and we pay off the car, of course they said someone will come in contact with you as soon as possible so you can pick up the title. 2 weeks pass by and no calls, no notifications and when I finally call to follow up they tell me it was ready since I paid it off and someone should have given it to me then.

All around polite smiley but poor customer service and overall all frustrating experience. Wouldn't not do business again and do not recommend.</Review></record>

{'time': 1552577295221, 'text': '(Translated by Google) Hello Ceci, thank you for your comment. Unfortunately it works a little different than you think and I would like to clarify. Banks work with risk and that is how they calculate the interest for each deal. When a car is older or has more than thousands of them consider it riskier (because it has a higher probability of needing work sooner) that is why the rate was higher with our vechile and lower with one with only 12,000 miles.\n\nHi Ceci, thanks for your comment.

Desafortunadamente, funciona un poco diferente de lo que piensas y me gustaría aclarar. Los bancos trabajan con riesgo y es así como calculan el interés para cada transacción. Cuando un automóvil es más viejo o tiene más millas, lo consideran más riesgoso (debido a que tiene una mayor probabilidad de necesitar trabajo antes), es por eso que la tasa fue mayor con nuestro vehículo y menor con uno con solo 12,000 millas.'}</response>

(Translated by Google) If you want to see your face, come here. Yesterday I went to buy a van with a high mileage and it would be financed through Westlake. The girl who helped us had good customer service, but was clearly inflating and adjusting the interest rate. They wanted to offer me a high 17% for almost 5 years! As we were not happy with the rate, they tried to pressure my husband to do it under him, since this was the second time we returned and they were offering him 15-16%. I know that my credit is not exceptional, but it's not bad that a distributor can see my face with great interest. We left and went to a dealer called Martinez Used cars in Livingston, CA. Usually, this is where we bought our cars, and I discovered that they also use WestLake Financial. To our surprise, we obtained a new truck with only 12 thousand miles and obtained an 11% interest rate with the same financing company. What does that tell you? That Rigo's car is only scamming people, they are thieves and should be closed. Do not trust them with the purchase of a car or anything else they offer!

If you want to get ripped off come here. Yesterday I went here to buy a truck, with high mileage and it was going to be through Westlake. The girl who helped us had good customer service, but was clearly inflating and tweaking the interest rate. They wanted to offer me a high 17% for almost 5 years! Since we were not happy with the rate, they tried pressing, and they were offering him 15-16%. I know my credit is not exceptional, but it's not bad where to dealer with low interest. We left and went to a dealer called Martinez Used cars in Livingston, CA. This is usually where we buy our cars, and I came to find that they also use WestLake Financial. To our surprise, we got a new truck with only 12 thousand miles and we got an interest rate of 11% with the same financing company! What does that tell you? That Rigo's auto is just ripping people off, they are crooks and should be down. Do not trust them with buy a car or anything else they offer!

Si quieres que te vean la cara, ven aquí. Ayer fui a comprar un camioneta con un alto kilometraje y se financiaría a través de Westlake. La chica que nos ayudó tenía un buen servicio al cliente, pero estaba claramente inflando y ajustando la tasa de interés. ¡Querían ofrecerme un alto 17% por casi 5 años! Como no estábamos contentos con la tasa, intentaron presionar a mi esposo para que lo hiciera debajo de él, ya que esta era la segunda vez que regresábamos y le estaban ofreciendo un 15-16%. Sé que mi crédito no es excepcional, pero no está mal que un distribuidor me pueda ver la cara con  mucho interés. Salimos y nos dirigimos a un dealer  llamado Martinez Used cars en Livingston, CA. Por lo general, aquí es donde compramos nuestros autos, y descubrí que también usan WestLake Financial. Para nuestra sorpresa, obtuvimos una camioneta  nueva con solo 12 mil millas y obtuvimos una tasa de interés del 11% con la misma compañía de financiamiento. ¿Qué te dice eso? Que Rigo’s auto solo está estafando a la gente, son ladrones y deberían cerrados. ¡No confíe en ellos con la compra de un automóvil o cualquier otra cosa que ofrezcan!

So I stumbled across this site accidentally and I’m so happy I did. I had a vision for the ring I wanted and found it in this store. It was EXACTLY what I wanted. My fiancé and I are getting married this week and the shipping was supposed to be about 10 days or so, so I knew I wouldn’t have my ring in time but that was fine. My ring arrived today, way earlier than expected and in time for my wedding. The owner of the store reached out to me personally immediately after my purchase and has been so kind and has given me updates as they come available. I’ve never experienced customer service like this and I am super impressed. The quality of my ring is even better than the picture showed. They really don’t do it justice. It’s absolutely perfect and you can tell it is made well. I’m so thankful I found this store. Will definitely continue to purchase from here moving forward. Angelucci Jewelry has my business for life. :))<//text>

I was doing much research and I decided to go with Angelucci, and I don’t regret it. The customer service that they provided was the best that I have received in my life. He always responded quickly and efficiently, he has products with the highest quality. Definitively I will recommend him always and I will always remain his client for whenever I need to buy something. My boyfriend loved the ring, thank you so much.<//Review><user_name>Lisary Duran</user_name>< response>

Shopping through angelucci jewelry was the best experience I’ve had. They are so quick and so professional. Probably some of the sweetest people I’ve spoken to about my order and they make it the easiest process. They really take care of you. I am so happy to have found them! Pasquale was SO sweet and SO helpful, I will most definitely be purchasing through them again. The product was even better than what I was expecting. Above and beyond.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><text>This is a great jewelry! I've known Mr. Angelucci for many years and I would not buy from anyone else. Whether you buy online or in his store, he always makes sure you are a happy camper. All his jewelry is top notch and very reasonably priced. He takes time to serve every customer and is not only interested in a sale but makes sure you get the best depending on the occasion and budget. Give his store a try! You will never regret it.< /text>< pictures>

Pasquale is THE BEST!! My husband and I planned a very short notice wedding ceremony and purchased his ring about 2 weeks before our wedding date. Not only did Pasquale get us the ring in time, he got us a SECOND ring in time because the first was too tight (our fault for not double checking his size). He also was in constant communication with us via text and responded quickly. I am so impressed with this level of customer service, truly. I will recommend his shop to anyone needing a ring in the future, and should we ever need another one (possibly a backup or for work) I will definitely be shopping here again. THANK YOU!!!!<//Review>

<review>I have never had an online shopping experience like this! As soon as I placed the order (about 9:30pm), I was messaged thanking me for my order (about 10pm). I was provided with shipping/tracking information the next day! We received the ring very quickly, sadly it wasn’t the right size! (My fault). I messaged to see what I might be able to for an exchange and they sent me 2 additional sizes to see what size would fit best! They provided me with a prepaid shipping label to send back the extra two rings that didn’t fit properly! I am so impressed with the quality of ring and how beautiful it is! Will definitely use in the future!!<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I recently bought a ring for my fiancé. He bought our rings but he didn’t really get anything special for himself. I had been searching for a ring that wasn’t going to break the bank and by chance I found Angelucci and I promise you, this will be the only place to shop. The ring came today and we both love it. I got him the tungsten material and it matches my ring and it’s gorgeous! The customer service is impeccable as well making sure to send me the tracking number and to keep in touch with me. Thank you Pasquale Angelucci. You have earned a customer for life!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I was going to give my granddaughter cash for graduation, even though cash gifts are basically against my [gift-giving] religion. The ultimate impersonal gift. Then I had an amazing idea! She's a tennis player, and I love tennis bracelets, so here is an ideal gift for her. But then I shopped.  I am not rich. Diamonds are expensive.  Somehow, luckily, the lesser gifts guides (lower-case gods) directed me to Angelucci Jewelry.  I read a few reviews, but all I could gather was Pasquale this, Pasquale that. I wanted to hear stories about the quality of the obviously high end costume jewelry, a Debutante Tennis 7,inch bracelet that I was considering.  In this review, I cannot look into the future to tell you what to expect if the piece is worn every day, but I can tell you that you will know that it will bring much pleasure as long as it does last.  I hated to confess that it was not 14k gold, though it looks like it and matches the 14k ring on her finger.  And that the stones are not natural diamonds, though they are most glorious imposters.  Olivia the graduate was in awe of the glamour.  Tia Suzi, my older daughter, turned to her husband and said, That's what I want!  She doesn't typically remove the jewelry that he buys her, so maybe the knock-off isn't for her - again, I don't know what to expect. But until their budget has room for a purchase 40X-50X the cost of this beauty, or more, since diamonds have different grades that raise costs, she might decide to opt for this and maybe choose to wear it less than 24/7.  I could go on and on about glam, but instead I'll simply reiterate the general consensus about Pasquale...he himself is a jewel. His customer service goes beyond excellence. I want to tell everyone that he is my Italian friend, but I've never met him and, with me in Saint Louis and he in Los Angeles, it's not likely. Key word: Enjoy!  Visit Angetucci Jewelry.com, meet Pasquale, claim a new friend, enjoy the sparkle in your loved ones' eyes.<//Review>< Pics>

After purchasing my two items (gold necklace and loop ear rings,) Pasquale immediately emailed me confirming my order. The communication was great throughout the whole process. The shipping was fast as well. The pieces are lovely and I have received several compliments. I would definitely purchase again. I am big on customer service and Pasquale was great!< /text>

Very professional , courteous and polite.  Immediately fixed my small problem as if it were  no sweat.  The ring is beautiful. Pictures do not do it any justice at all.  I can’t wait to marry my soon to be husband on March 28! So glad I found this company . Will be telling my friends and family about this company. Thank you again< /text>

<Text>I recently had my favorite 1 carat Leo diamond earrings stolen from me. I found Angelucci Jewelry online and they have been a complete god send. The customer service by the owner and their beautiful products made this transaction effortless. I will say Angelucci makes you feel at home and treats you like family. I will be a return customer. If you are looking for a new piece of jewelry, please seriously consider Angelucci. You won't be disappointed and their customer service is top notch.</Text></record></dataset><record>

First let me say this company is amazing! I freaked out on trying to find a ring for our wedding day and trying to time it to where it’ll arrive in time. But Angelucci Jewelry took all my worries away. Owner is great to talk to and super fast shipping.  I’m so blessed to have find them. Stress free experience and so many options. I’m one happy bride. I can’t stop looking at the ring. I hope my future husband love it as much as I do. ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</Text>

<text>Wow this store is amazing! They are so personable and text me the confirmation number as soon as it shipped. I got the wrong size and they right right away sent the shipping label so that I can exchange the sizes no problem. I’m so glad I went to them instead of the chain stores. I can tell this more than just jewelry for them, it’s about the friendship and trust for something so special for someone. I found them by accident and I’m so glad I did. I will definitely be shopping with them for my future jewelry needs. <3</text>< Pics>

We showed him the designs of what we wanted and had it ready for us in a few weeks. He was very communicative through out the entire process, which made my Type A self so happy and delivered on every level. We are so happy with the rings and can’t stop showing them to everyone we know. I would absolutely recommend paying him a visit for any needs.

< review>
My fiancé and I visited Pasquale in September 2020. I contacted him letting him know that my fiancé was pretty much already set on the her choice of ring, which was from another vendor. However, we wanted to be able to view rings in person and discuss sizing. Pasquale set us up with an appointment, and was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We didn’t feel pressured for a second and Pasquale generously took his time with us knowing we likely weren’t going to be making a purchase. We are getting married in June and she loves her ring, and our meeting with Pasquale was a big part of her feeling confident about the choice she made. I would recommend him to anyone in the market for high quality jewelry.  And Pasquale, I hope you’re doing well. Thanks again for sharing your knowledge with us.< /review>

I am loving my new ring!!!
My husband let me pick a ring that I wanted as a gift. But, the one I chose does not have my size. I was disappointed because I really love the design...Then came an email and a text message from Pasquale the owner, that made me feel special, even though I am not purchasing a very expensive jewelry. He took time and effort to communicate and give me options very close to the design I originally chose. From there I was able to pick a design that I love.
I am very  pleased with how he handled online buyer like myself. Their services are very personalized.
I am also very pleased with my yellow gold vermeil princess cut ring, it looks very elegant for a very reasonable price.</Text>

I originally ordered online without speaking to anyone. Almost immediately the staff reached out on several platforms to customize my order to be sure I got exactly what I wanted. Pasquale made my experience amazing with his attention to detail and genuine concern for my satisfaction. I will do all future business with Angelucci Jewelry. I normally believe that it’s the businesses pleasure to service it’s customers but in this case it’s my pleasure to have had such a great experience with the team at Angelucci.</Text>

I was very skeptical at first. I live in Texas and was very worried to order from Angelucci. I still followed my gut and placed my order, hoping for positive results. That same day I received a personal email from Pasqual not just some automated robot thing. I felt more comfortable and knew that I was in good hands. He also sent me the tracking information within that same day. Shipping was fast and everything was nicely packaged. My husband and I received our wedding bands and we couldn’t be happier. Thank you so much! Coming from a complete stranger that took a risk; I highly recommend them and will definitely be ordering again!<//text>

Me and my wife were referred to Pasquale. We didn’t know the first thing about jewelry but were in the market to upgrade my wife’s wedding ring. Pasquale listened to our preferences and what we were in the market for. He had a tremendous amount of patience and explained everything to us with as much detail that was needed for us to have a full understanding of what rings we were going to be getting the biggest bang for our buck. We made a selection on our first visit and felt that we had our every need met. We also received my wife’s ring prior to our agreed upon date which made for an excellent gift for me to have ready for my wife on Christmas Day! Thank you for everything Pasquale!<//Text>

Simply the finest personal service. I’ve been a customer for many years.  So I know the Angelucci family name opens doors in the jewelry district that directly effect price.  I’ve compared exactly the same piece or stone with other jewelers and retailers.  No one, can touch Angelucci’s quality for the price.  Getting to build a relationship with your jeweler over time is priceless.<//Review>

I found Angelucci Jewelry on-line, and I am so happy that I found them! Pasquel provided exceptional service! Pasquel was professional; he was extremely responsive to my inquiries and offered suggestions to ensure customer satisfaction. When I received the halo ring setting, it was well made and I was floored at how stunning  the setting was!! I highly recommend that you shop with Angelucci Jewelry; you will not be disappointed!!!<//review>

This place is AMAZING!!! I have ordered from them twice and each time was awesome. The owner Pasquale is very hands on. He personally reached out to me with answers to some questions i had. The jewelry quality is excellent. My first order was a wedding set for myself and the second order is my husbands wedding band. He loves it. It looks exactly as pictured. Pasquale also sent the ring express which i didnt expect. He went over and beyond to get the wedding band to me in time for our wedding day. Thank you so much Angelucci Team!!!!!!!< /Text>

I was really nervous about finding and purchasing an engraved ring for my fiancé for our wedding. So I did the normal online window shopping. I was contacted later that day by owner Pasquale. I can honestly say, it was his correspondence and warmth that made me decide on using this jeweler. Which I found so surprising, since this wasn't an in person purchase. If you are looking for that family feel do not delay. I am sooooo happy I didn't wait. The ring is beautiful and is amazing quality. Even my mom said so after seeing it. Don't hesitate, purchase from them today.< /review>

Attending this event in shopping 🛍 for a engagement/wedding rings with Pashko Juncaj was one of the most memorable experiences . He brought in depth knowledge of the background of the products shown. He spoke with integrity and reassurance of comfortably. It definitely beats buying “over the counter “ jewelry. I feel everyone investing in long term jewelry, definitely, needs to be educated on what you are purchasing.... and we were and will continue to use this professional Jewelry business as our go-to- family destination. God Bless this Shop in many more years of business to come🙏< /text>

Little over 15 years ago, angelucci jewelry made the perfect ring for me. I requested a Irish claddagh ring, specific though. I wanted it made out of an ounce of gold, where it had enough to heft You could feel it on your hand. It had to be 18 karat Italian gold, and from the size that we were able to create from the middle of the heart of the ring, we were able to bezel a 1 carat beautiful diamond. I still wear this ring on my hand everyday, and think how much it means to me still. Angelucci jewelry can give you memories for life that can never be taken away from you. Gold and diamonds last forever and the memories they provide are intangible. If you ever need, a special ring made, and you want it done to detail, with only the highest quality material, you go to angelucci jewelry. PS it wasn't the engagement ring that caused the divorce! The ring got me married. LOL< /review>

<Review>The most Amazing PERSONAL SERVICE!  Working directly with Pasquale is like having my own jewelry concierge.  He & his family have amazing connections in the jewelry business and save me significantly!!  He took my Irish grandmothers antique ring from the 1930’s and custom refurbished it and fit it perfectly for my wives hand.  Incredible. I can’t say enough. I know for life I’ll never pay full price for the highest quality jewelry.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Pasquale helped my fiancé and I find my dream wedding ring! A 3.25 round brilliant, SI F in color engagement round solitaire. We have been to many different jewelers in the past year, not only does Pasquale give you his most honest recommendations for the value of your budget but is beyond patient and wants you to be absolutely positive of your purchase and happy. We can’t give more than 5 stars or I would. We definitely will be back!</text>

My husband wasn’t able the perfect hexagon ring anywhere when he wanted to propose so instead he and Pasquale created one and it was beautiful! If you can’t find the perfect ring out there, you can create one at Angelucci Jewelry! I love the fact the my ring is unique and Pasquale took the time with my husband to create the perfect ring for me. He was professional, genuine, and affordable! Thanks again!< /Text>

We needed to purchase a specific type of necklace for our daughters wedding.  I called and received the necklace the next day.  The necklace was exactly what we wanted and very reasonably priced.  The person who helped me was great.  Would totally recommended Angelucci Jewelers!!< /review>

I bought a ring recently and I might say this is one of the best customer service experiences I had in a while. The owner personally texted me himself and interacted with me which is a major plus in my book.
I wish every business would interact with the customer like this one.
A plus service will definitely be back!!!
Thanks!< /Text>

I purchased earrings. Between customer service and the follow up things were good. But after wearing what I thought was silver, I realized that they may not have been true silver. I had an allergic reaction. Silver is the only metal that I can wear.<//Text>

<Review>I love love love this store it’s better than many jewelry stores I’ve been to always have the same accessories. At Angelucci jewelers they have such unique rings and pendants and have been wearing their jewelry for 10+ years. Check out their website as well to find the newest styles and order from the comfort of your home as well. I don’t go a single day without wearing their jewelry I have.< /Review>< pics>

Fantastic service. Extremely personalized service with great prices. I had a custom ring done for my wife and Angelucci Jewelry provided guidance, education and support throughout the process. At no time did i feel like i was being "sold to" or being pushed in a direction. They took the time to listen, ask questions, give options and then delivered an amazing product - 5 day earlier than promised! I will never go back to a mall jewelry store or some large company, not when this kind of personal 5 star service and product is available  - and at a better price..  I guess this is why this family has been successfully in this business for generations!<//Review>

<Review>I had been looking for a necklace for a while. I found the website when I was online. I decided to order and I’m glad that I did. Pasquale takes very good care of his customers. He pays close attention to what you’re looking for, as well as make sure that you’re satisfied with your purchase. This will be my jeweler from now on. Very pleasant experience. I’ve been recommending him to my family so that they will share in the very same buying experience that I had.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I am so happy with my 20 yr. wedding anniversary ring! At first, I was not sure of what kind of ring I wanted...these decisions are not easy. Pashko was patient, extremely helpful and such a professional. He helped me find the perfect anniversary ring. In addition, he was more than happy to work on my wedding rings that needed to be resized and have a baguette replaced. After so many years, my engagement and wedding band looked like brand new rings again---simply beautiful. Angelucci Jewelry exceeded our expectations. We received the most amazing service. Thank you!</review>

I met with Pasqualle to help me design an engagement ring. This process was very special to me because I was going to be engaged to the woman of my life. Pasqualle extremely helpful in creating a beautiful ring that my fiancé loves. I highly recommend Angelucci jewelry. Best experience ever and he accommodated us by having my fiancé’s ring sized.< /review>

The first item I chose was out of stock, so the man whom I am assuming is the owner reached out to me and informed of that news. He also told me that he was going to keep looking until he found a piece that I would love just as much. Well guess what, he did exactly that! I have made that purchase and cannot what to get it. From now on I will go to him if I am looking for something on the unique side of the jewelry spectrum!</review>

Absolutely Beautiful! I was worried about the sizing being off but Pascquale reached out to me and made sure that I did not worry about the exchange process or the shipping costs. Turns out, the ring fit just right, looks so elegant and shines so much. I would certainly recommend this ring to anyone looking for a wedding band. Thank You SO much!<//review>

100% TRUSTWORTHY! I met the owner Pashko Juncaj, a couple years ago and this guy is the real deal. Many times I caught scammers telling me their Gold is superior or that their jewelry is high quality and over selling their goods. NOT with Angelucci Jewelry. I always receive honest responses, even at their own expense. I highly recommend Angelucci Jewelry. Their decades of experience and their amazing customer service keeps me, as well as many other loyal customers coming back. If you have questions about Jewelry the Angelucci Jewelry is who you need to call.</text>

Pasquale was such a help with choosing the perfect necklace for my daughter. I was looking around at stores and everything was so expensive. A friend recommended Angelucci to me and from the moment i spoke to him on the phone I knew he was experienced and was going to be able to give me the best deal possible of the finest quality jewlery due to his connections. I strongly recommend giving him a call before making any purchase anywhere else<//Text>

Me and my now fiance had the BEST experience with Pasquale! We both knew nothing about jewelry prior to coming to see him. We had a rough idea and some Pinterest ideas of what we wanted in a ring. We showed Pasquale and showed us different options, had me try on different rings, and really educated me all about jewelry.

We ended up creating and designing an absolute beautiful ring. It was everything I wanted & more. I can't believe I get to stare at this ring for the rest of my life!

Pasquale was just as excited as we were throughout the entire process which made it so much fun. He's such an easygoing, fun loving guy who truly cares and wants to get you the best deal possible.

Just go schedule an appointment with Pasquale and see for yourself exactly what I am talking about. I promise you won't be disappointed! Pasquale is now not only our lifelong jeweler..but a life long friend. Thanks again so much Pasquale :)

Love,
Augie & Nicole</review>

I was seconds away from buying a ring at Robins Brothers when Pasquale gave me a call and said he could give me the same exact ring for a better price. I left Robins Brothers, gave him a chance and never looked back. My wife LOVES her engagement ring and her wedding band. She’s gotten so many compliments. Anytime we want it cleaned up, he does his best to do it in a timely manner. Good guy. Nice family. Good values.</Review>

Sitting down with Pasquale to design jewelry is such a pleasure! His office is welcoming and comfortable. He listens to your ideas and has great insights and suggestions! He made a beautiful custom Heirloom Hawaiian bracelet for my daughter for her 21st birthday, that she never takes off! He has also made my other daughter beautiful rings! Anytime some asks for a jeweler my girls and I will say “You need to call Pasquale!”</Review>

<Review>My first experience with Angelucci was very good.  Pasquale delivered a custom made engagement ring that my girlfriend-now-wife absolutely loved.  There was some minor miscommunication on the price so I paid more than I expected but overall it was a good deal.

We decided to go with Angelucci for our wedding bands and the experience was absolutely awful.  We had been promised bands in the month of August but did not receive them until March, One Week Before Our Wedding!!  Luckily my wife and I had planned so far ahead or else we would have been ringless for our own wedding.  During our experience we also felt like our time was not valued.  We had scheduled an in person meeting and drove an hour and a half to get to Pasquale's office only for him to tell us that he had nothing to show us.  He could have called to inform us or even rescheduled the meeting but he was inconsiderate of our time.  All in all we experienced many empty promises, very flaky communication, and there were many instances where it felt like we were working with someone very inexperienced.

It's a shame that something that started off well had to end so poorly.  We will not be coming here again.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Had a wonderful experience getting both my custom engagement ring and wedding rings from Pasquale at Angelucci Jewelry. Every step of the process from choosing the stones to custom designing the bands was so easy, yet so personal that I really can’t imagine using another jeweler. %100 five star business and service.<//text>

<Review>Simply excellent personal customer service!

Every single time I bring a jewelry idea or piece I see somewhere else Angelucci Jewelry is able to build the same jewelry for less.

I was going to buy my wife a ring at a major brand jeweler and he had a custom made version that looked exactly the same with a higher clarity diamond for a lower cost!

You can’t beat multigenerational connections in the LA jewelry district.</Review><gmapID>0x80c32a791708ab8d:0xf20485b14b0a0b29</gmapID>< rating>

My son and i went shopping together for an engagement ring for his girlfriend. After visiting about everywhere in the inland empire even Costco, we found better quality for a better price at Angelucci’s! He was a friend of a friend’s and i was told he does wonderful work and keeps his overhead low so he can always beat the prices w better quality than the big box stores. We were very happy w the custom ring he made! Later my husband had a beautiful bracelette made for me!</Text>

Every jeweler sells diamonds, Angelucci Jewelery strives to give you an experience of a lifetime while helping you choose what’s just right for you. Professional, excellent customer service and Pashko holds to his words when promise is made to deliver. Prices are almost to good to believe, I can say he’s not in it for the money. He’s in it to help create those unforgettable moments that will last for a lifetime. If you want a diamond go to your local jeweler, if you want help creating a memory that will last for a lifetime go to Angelucci Jewelery.< /text>

We had a great experience with Angelucci Jewelery. My fiancé got to design my ring and I absolutely love it!
My ring needed to be resized since it was a little big, we took it to Angelucci and They took care of it in less than a week. We will definitely be coming back for all our future Jewelery needs.< /Review>

Coffee and pastries are delicious. Sandwiches are quite varied. From standard roast beef to pesto..all really good. Husband loves the Chinese chicken salad. The soups are just wonderful. Tomato bisque and Thai soup are favs. All portions are generous.<//review>< gmapID>

<text>Good selection. Fast service. Good coffee. Plenty of space to dine with friends or setup to work on a laptop.
Disappointing Chicken Caesar. Chicken was unexpectedly completely cold.  Would be a good option for the cashier to ask and provide guests an option to have it heated.  Poor ventilation in the restaurant means you will walk out smelling like a grill.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<review>It's nice having a place like this close to home. Prices are pretty reasonable, and so far, everything my wife and I have tried has been tasty. I wish the Chai was a bit more on the spicy side, but it is still good, and I would order it again.< /review><pics>None</pics><GmapID>0x809adb4627a00b5b:0x2665cc21f03f3fc5</GmapID>< Resp>

I love their Hot Turkey and Cheese Croissants! Only one Star less because there is a man working the counter and I feel like he is being a bit condescending. I have been helped by him twice now and his attitude has been the same both times. I prefer to have the cute little black girl wait on me. She is so sweet! A much better attitude would have had 5 Stars.< /text>

This is no longer a La Bou, but they purchase the same foods for the most part, but not everything is the same. I'm going to miss La Bou though.<//review>

The employees at this La Bou are the best. They know my name and have my regular order ready every Saturday morning within minutes without me having to say anything. They even put my order aside with my name on it if they are running low. My favorite place to pickup a quick breakfast.<//review>

The one star is because the food is good. Unfortunately the service is terrible. The supervisors   are very rude. They never have a smile and if you get your order wrong they will get really upset and make you feel uncomfortable. If they don't like the job they should let others take care of the customer.  They don't value returning customers. I eat almost every lunch here and yet they stare with anger when they see the customer walk in.<//Review>

Coffee is decent. Overall a nice little spot to grab some lunch or pastries. Lunch hour is typically pretty busy though, as there are many offices nearby.< /Review>< pics>

The girl behind the counter was curt and did not say good morning or thank you. I noticed she was pleasant enough to the customers that walked in after me.

I called that number to speak to the supervisor and that same person answered. Not one to give up I told her I would find out who her boss is. I am posting a negative review!</review><name>Brenda Easter< /name><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>This Folsom Blvd la Bou not customer oriented.  Won't bake baguettes early enough for morning customers like the downtown 11th street store does.  Will not serve hot tea in regular cup for here,  only paper cups,  but the downtown store does.  The guy in morning appears to be lazy and has been late opening<//text>< pics>

<Review>Food was outstanding.  Service was friendly and prompt. I found the taste on par with other highly rated Pho Restaurants.  Some reviews I read stated the portions were small, I found the opposite, now size was large in my opinion.  Maybe they changed their portion size recently.  Overall great place, great food, friendly and clean.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< user>

< Review>
We only had their pho and fried tofu today. When it comes to the taste, its really delicious and we couldnt wait to try their other food. The only thing i didnt like was the pork on my soup coz it wasnt sliced thin for it to cook in my hot soup. But again taste wise, i cant complain. For tofu serving i think its to little or not enough for its price, i was expecting more. But its really yummy so definitely will get some of this again when i come back< /Review>

<Text>My go-to spot for pho. Husband gets the rare steak and brisket pho and I usually order the veggie pho or veggie banh mi because I don’t eat meat. Excellent authentic Vietnamese food, fast service. Haven’t sat down in the restaurant because of COVID but the packaging is sturdy and they provide a disposable bowl so you don’t have to grab your own.</Text>< pics>

This is my first time ordering from them. I ordered takeout and I was handing "my" order and paid for it. Got home and realized I picked up the wrong order. Called the store, I returned the food that was given to me. I get there and give them the food they gave me, I had to walk back to my car for my wallet and I see another customer walk out the door with the food that I just returned to the store. THIS IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. They gave me a refund for the food I just gave back to them and charged me full price of the the order they got wrong after costing me two trips to the store. Then I get home and find a hair in one of the boxes of food we ordered. The service is bad and the food was okay.< /review>

<review>The quality is uber-reliable. I've tried about 20 Pho joints in the San Diego area in the last 5 years. This definitely the best. The texture of the noodles is always perfect. The broth always flavorful. The service is always fast and courteous. The place is always clean.< /review>< user>

<review>Simple and reliable Vietnamese food.  I enjoy the decent Pho and hope to try the other dishes sometime.  Staff are busy helping but get the orders wring sometimes.  However, they are quick to correct their mistakes.  Small but cozy space right off main roads.  I always have lunch here when I'm town for a work meeting nearby.</review>< time>

We only had their pho and fried tofu today. When it comes to the taste, its really delicious and we couldnt wait to try their other food. The only thing i didnt like was the pork on my soup coz it wasnt sliced thin for it to cook in my hot soup. But again taste wise, i cant complain. For tofu serving i think its to little or not enough for its price, i was expecting more. But its really yummy so definitely will get some of this again when i come back<//review>

I grew up in CITY HEIGHTS.  I KNOW WHAT GOOD PHO TASTE LIKE.  THE PORTIONS ARE VERY SMALL.  I ORDERED FRIED RICE ONE TIME AND IT WAS LITERALLY PORTIONED OUT IN A SMALL BOWL.  CHARGED ME $8. FROM THAT DAY ON... I WOULD NEVER GO THERE.  BESIDES THE FOOD IS AVERAGE.  TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THAT QUALITY OF FOOD.<//Review>

<text>Surprisingly good find in the Sequoia Mall. Excellent, refreshing food, very reasonably priced, and with a wide selection of boba flavors.
Slight downside is that they only take cash. The place is well worth the inconvenience. Highly recommend.</text>< pics>

This is the best Vietnamese food in SD I believe. They put Pate on there sandwiches, huge bowl of phu with lots of meat, curry chicken is the bomb reminds me of my mothers so tasty, and the egg rolls are some of the best I have ever had anywhere filled with pork. Everything taste so good here must try if your in the area< /text>

<Text>Been dining here for at least 3 yrs. NEVER had a problem with anything. Yesterday, I called in to pick up an order of shrimp fried rice.  It was so hot & fresh!😋 ....They remodeled the edifice; however there was a lot of trash on the floor (which is unusual for them).<//Text>< user>

<text>The food was very good. I ordered some of the pho and it was maid to perfection. I asked them to not include tripe and tendon and they adjusted the order accordingly. The broth was hot and included the flavors that I liked especially the star anise. The flank steak was tender and the meatballs were nicely flavored. The soup included all the trimmings from jalapeno, bean sprouts and some mint. Also was served with a variety of hot spices and sauces to add to my pho. I also got an order of spring rolls with shrimp. There was just the right amount of shrimp and rice noodles along with a homemade peanut dipping sauce that made it even more delicious. I will certainly recommend that my friends go and I will be back!< /text>< Pics>

Delicious!! First time I ever had pho and much better than I ever expected. The staff was friendly and kept serving right up until they closed. They also asked us if we wanted anything else before the kitchen closed which I really appreciated.</Review>

The customer service could be better. The workers just mean mugged us as we walked in and did not even welcome us. The food was out in less than 5 minutes. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and it honestly was plain. The little soup that they used for pho was really good and bright though.</Text>

<text>I keep trying new places around San Diego for Pho, and this small restaurant was as good as any other. First impressions; clean, friendly, and fairly popular for a Sunday evening. The drink service came right away, delicious light iced tea. The food came to our table literally within THREE MINUTES of placing our order, so don't believe any reviews about slow service, as it must have been a fluke. Delicious, hot, fast Pho with all the regular fixings. The wife and I split a large Pho Tai and Spring Rolls, and the check, with drinks was around $15. BIG THUMBS UP!!!</text></record>

It would be nice to eat here without recieving an attitude from the staff. It would be even better to eat here without them staring at you the entire time, as well as obviously talking about you amongst themselves in their native language. The food however, is very good. quite the uncomfortable experience.< /text>

The Pho has diminished in taste. I had to put alto of hot sauce and Hoisin sauce in my bowl to get some taste back in the Pho. Its still a good place just the broth is bland. Don't think I will be returning anytime soon.< /Text>

This is just a slighty average pho place. It's small with no a/c, the prices are fair, and the menu has a variety of items. The service is alright.

I got the vegetable and tofu pho with chicken broth. There was a variety of veggies in it, but the noodles broke pretty easily and seemed kinda dry. The broth itself wasn't the best either...it tasted like mock broth, something that isn't natural.

It was crowded so maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but based on what I got, there's better.</Review>

<review>The pho is delicious. The sandwiches are bomb. The staff is always happy to help. This restaurant is usually pretty busy because the food is fantastic. You never wait long to be seated, and the food is served quickly. This is my go-to pho for dine-in and take-out.<//review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) The sky is so delicious that Pho is called Pho restaurant ??? 1 bowl of pho, which is like a 2-week-old meat, is safe, the broth is like boiling water to remove sugar and fish sauce and stir up, the price is not up to 20 plus. These reviews are American or Mexican so don't know

(Original)
Trời oi nấu phở như vậy mà đặc tên là tiệm phở??? 1 tô phở gì mà thịt như củ 2 tuần an hôi rình, nước lèo thì giống như nước sôi bỏ đường và nước mắm vô rồi quậy lên, giá thì không tới 20 cộng. Những reviews ỡ đây là dân Mỹ hoặc Mễ nên không biết thôi< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I always dread getting a smog check letter because I know I have to go buy a Groupon, drive to some far scary looking place, and wait for possibly a long time.

Well, looks like I found my favorite Smog Check place.  This guy is fast!  I brought my dog over so we can go for a walk in the neighborhood while they did the smog check.  I dropped off the car and started to go for a walk with my dog.  I looked at my watch thinking I'll be back in about 30 minutes.  The worker called me back and I thought something was wrong, but nope! He was done.

Paid and the price was the cheaper than getting a Groupon for the Sunnyvale locations.

Will be back.  Thank you!<//Text><gmap_id>0x808fb444cd09ba17:0x1335c85a0f1a9c76</gmap_id>< Pics>

He did not do the ODB Scan before running the whole test. The Catalytic converter data was not ready because I had replaced the battery.

I came back for the free re-test two weeks later. The doors were locked during business hours. The phone was not answered. Their message machine was full.

This use to be a great place. It now appears under new management.

I took the car to the place at 10625 N. De Anza Blvd. They did the re-inspection quickly with not problem.<//text>

I have been this place for more than 6 years. For the vast majority of times, I could get the service promptly, therefore I just sat in the small waiting room reading my stuff. However, during the last week's visit after more than a year from the last visit because of the pandemic, I found out  the business is booming and the waiting room is closed. Therefore, I had to leave my car there and he told me it would be ready around 3PM. He called me at 3:30PM, close enough.

I do trust this guy. I know I could probably get a cheaper oil and oil change elsewhere with coupon (Her charged me $40-45), but every time I asked him to check whether the car need other maintenance, he never charged me for unnecessary services.

The guy is frank and straightforward. I am surprised he got a few low ratings here, may be it is because of language/cultural barrier.<//Text>

$40 for smog test, add $1 if paying by credit card. In and out after 5 minutes with no issue. The only thing to note is that the business hours listed here is from 8:30am,  but they dont open until 9am, not sure if this is temporary change or not.< /review>

<review>The boss came to the store at 4 o'clock in the afternoon on an appointment with him (no appointment). He arrived at his store at 9 o'clock the next morning. The announcement said it would be open at 11 o'clock. Now wait until 11:30.  I think I should make an appointment first so I can come</review>< user_name>

<Review>I was trying to find a place to smog my car. I called this place the guy said if you come now there is no one ahead of you and no one was. Then I asked the price he said $40.00, it was $40.0 nothing additional no games. He said it will take 5 minutes and took 5 minutes!! I was in and out in 5 minutes, I just could not believe it. The lady at the desk was a sweet heart. I never had such a good service. I recommend this place with all my heart. If I could I would give them 6 stars.<//Review>< time>

Reasonable prices and great service!! We always go for the SMOG check here. This time, my car broke down and my husband took it today morning to get it repaired. The owner figured out the problem and fixed it in less than 5 minutes. Great service and I hope this shop stays here to service us for years to come!</text>

Started smog check w/o checking if car computer is ready. Charged full price nevertheless (no smog checked performed). Didn't offer free re-check as other guys do but said it will be only $10 to re-test. Didn't honor the offer when I came back - asked FULL price again. Became UPSET when I said they will lose the loyal customer. BAD ATTITUDE PEOPLE< /review>

When your car fail we only charge you $31.75 then when you bring it back within 30 days you only have to pay $10, it's notice on the invoice. But you wait until yesterday (2-12-19) you brought it back and ask us for retest. We told you, you have to pay everything over cause it's more than 30 days then you start yelling and screaming at my employee and specially she is a girl.  We do not need a customer like you who had no respect to a girl."}<//Resp>

Quick and awesome! Called in before to check if there was a wait and brought my car in. The owner met me out front as I drove up and had me sign some paperwork. The entire check only took five minutes and I was on my way back home.The test was only $40, and if my car failed the first test, the second test would be free< /Review>

Practically instant service. I pulled in for a smog check and saw three cars in front of me. I figured it would all take about 30 mins, but I was out of there 10 minutes after I pulled up. Very friendly, very efficient. My new go to smog check place.< /review>

I had an oil change done and tire pressure check plus a smog certificate done. My vehicle was ready to go in less than 20 minutes! Smog passed, they sent the certificate to DMV and all this for $70 and some odd cents after taxes and fees.  That's not the deal of the century, but it is a more than fair deal and especially considering the service and turn around time,,,, exceptional!

Made appointment and arrived on time. It took Hai only 15 minutes to complete the test and get out there. Very courteous and friendly people. He has free WIFI and comfortable waiting room now.

* I added engine/injector cleaner to fuel to clean up the system fist then added new gas and got very good test result< /Text>

<text>My new favorite smog check place!  I was using Valero at DeAnza and Prospect, but the person doing smog check there was just not very nice and refused to match price.  So he was $12 more than anyone else.  Went to Auto Smog Test & Repair, and found the people there VERY VERY nice and it took less than 5 minutes total.<//text>< Pictures>

I called ahead mid-morning and he said to come on in, as there was no wait. When I asked he projected that it would take about ten minutes, and $40. I brought work in case it would take longer, and I was worried it might cost more, but it really was only ten minutes, $40. The technician was very considerate, and courteous. My car is older, and did not pass smog. He seemed genuinely discouraged that he had to give me bad news, and referred me to a place nearby where I could get a quick estimate for repairs, and said that if I come back to him for a recheck after repairs he would only charge me $10 for the second one. I went there and was offered a discount for mentioning that I was referred by Auto Smog Test Only.< /Text>

<Review>Hai is the owner and simply put, he is a diamond in the rough. He is super quick and efficient with smog checks and highly skilled as a mechanic.

Long story short... after moving to the area, I was having bad streak with my vehicle, finances, and finding good business. Hai completely turned that story around. He was straight up, quick, helpful, committed, understanding, and accommodating.

There are no surprises with him. He will provide solutions that are in your best interest. He even suggested I wait on certain costly repairs because he knew I was in a bind financially and knew certain repairs could wait.

Fully appreciate Hai and how he runs his business. I have no hesitations to recommend him. My only regret is I waited so long to write this review. :)</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fb444cd09ba17:0x1335c85a0f1a9c76< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Had a good experience here and got myself a car! Come to this location and don’t go to the one on Bullard and Blackstone. They weren’t interested in helping us and told us they sold the car we wanted. Showed them the picture but they just kept saying yea yea that one is sold. We left that place and contacted the picture online. This place contacted us right away and we went there. Basically the other location lied to us. This location is more friendly and not pushy as the other location. The other location they pick and choose their customer’s also, this location makes you feel welcomed. Thank you for your help Shaun!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Salesman Alex was pushy and was haggling me big time. Wasted 2+ hours of my time when I made it clear I wasn’t going to purchase the car from them. I just wanted out the door pricing on a couple of cars I was interested in (and made it clear I was still going to look at other places). Alex insisted that a soft pull credit pull would be needed but it wouldn’t effect my credit.

Fast forward 2 months later, checked my credit score and these snakes did 3 hard credit pulls. I have excellent credit but it was very unprofessional and they flat out lied to me. I ended up buying a car elsewhere from a dealership who NEVER NEEDED TO RUN MY CREDIT and completed a negotiation WITH out the door pricing over the phone. (Yes, it’s possible). Ended up cashing the car I wanted.

Don’t get scammed and pushed into believing any lies  from this dealership.< /Review>

If you’re in need of a car don’t come here save yourself time and money and go to a reputable car lot. These people are a joke and will waste your time and not even be able to get you approved with a bank without multiple hard inquiries on your credit report and then they ask for a ridiculous down payment when they promote a $500 down payment. I should have listened when friends tried to warn me about this place and how they do business. The sales man who helped us was only friendly until we mentioned we were only looking today and weren’t planning on buying, he then asked us several times “how much money can you come up with today?”  So sleazy and unprofessional.< /text>

<Text>Can you put -stars??  The worst car buying experience one could ever have. They’re dishonest and pushy  and marked up The price on a Kia Optima we bought but I didn’t realize it till after we bought it. Then they Wouldn’t help or comment on the subject plus there was a problem with an aftermarket side mirror and when asked about it they denied having knowledge of it!!  be careful when dealing with these people. They have horrible ethics<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1524605076381</time></record>

< review>
Sold us a truck and  8 months later . with only driving it 4000 miles is not drivable the engine needs to be replaced so calling the dealer today they said they cant do nothing because they said i refused the contract to warrant the car .I WAS NEVER TOLD OF SUCH THING AND WHO WOULD REFUSE THAT they took advantage of us not know anything about cars and being excited to purchase one . so now im stuck with a truck i can not fix so i have to surrender it and be stuck with payments on something i dont have or get bad credit where i cant buy a truck later this is a scam and they should be held accountable for using these tactics with bad intention. We obviously knew we were getting a high miles truck knowingly we would have to repair stuff but the whole engine they should of inspected and known it wasent right they also said that the truck was sold at 81000 and im at 91000 now umm ... On paper it says it was sold at 88364 soooo.... Odometer fraud ?</review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>Went in with interest to buy a car at this dealership(Own a Car lot 2). My advice would be to bring someone who knows about cars, or know about the particular car you are planning to buy. They have a fair price on their cars, but with that being said there are things that caught my attention. The car I was interested in had been in an accident before, there was paint over spray on the passenger side fender and the replacement front bumper that had been re-sprayed. There were visible stains in the interior of the car, little miscellaneous items were missing in the interior. The car was a 2015 model that should usually would come with a key fob, but the dealership seemed to only have a basic key for the car(no open/lock mechanism, only key). There were deep scratches on one area of the car and a mismatched hubcap, two other hubcaps were visibly broken in certain places. Tires were mismatched and one in particular had a slash. Inside the engine compartment the ECU had seemed to be rewired with an odd looking device(black box with 3 red LEDs, one on, one blinking, and one steady between the two, to be honest I have never seen this before and do not know if it is a factory option/component). The car did start and seem to run fine, but engine was loud and seem to lack power for such a low mileage car. Steering on the car was off as they did have mismatched tires on the front end. After the test drive I asked the guy "OK, so what is wrong with the car?" The guy said, "you tell me? Where's the dent? Where's the problem?" At this point I'd been completely OK if he was honest, but with his response I felt there were more problems than expected. I asked for a CarFax which they did have, BUT it did not seem legitimate, seemed to have been cut and pasted. I tried negotiating on price as an option but if they were to fix things they will charge extra. Some things they agreed to repair, but they didn't give a clear answer as to when(MY WORD OF ADVICE: Do not sign any paper work until the work is complete). Overall they were very nice dishonest people who are trying to make a marginal profit on their vehicles. Another thing was they do not work with other financial institutions, they prefer in house financing and are not clear on how they will finance you. You had to have money down, "how much you ask?" "I don't know it's up to you," is the response I got. It wasn't a bad experience or bad customer service, it was just one of those feelings where it felt something wasn't right. Hope this helps and best of luck in purchasing a car.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x8094677e11b0d3e5:0xf3636566fa8ea527<//Gmap_id></record>

I had a great experience today with the sprint service techs.  My phone was glitching and turning off on its own for days.
The tech took his time explaining the problem and got it working in no time.
It's a real sad day when you have to function without your phone. So the ease, skill and speed was truly appreciated. Thank you Will</text>

Although I left frustrated, I can't fault the store staff.

Omar assisted me,  was polite,  patient, and did the best he could under the circumstances.

As a 20-year Sprint Customer, I expect a bit more from my overall experience.

Unfortunately, what should have been  a  simple switch from an S6 to an unlocked S8 that I got from a friend has been anything other than simple.

Again, not faulting the local staff, moreso Sprint corporate.< /Text>

<Text>These reviews you folks are reading on here about a David are FAKE. A little critical thinking could go a long way. When I was being helped by this David person, you will realize he actually knows very little if anything at all. I went in to simply swap my phone from one to another, and he had to get 3 people involved...I should have just done this online. I'm actually surprised Google let so many fake reviews get posted on here, too. Just try to avoid David for your sake.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

From switching my service from worst-in-the-world-AT&T, to getting an 8+, to needing help with some tech issues, to replacing the screen protector that cracked (thank goodness Sprint sold me a Zagg w warranty and I got a new one free in a couple of days )...the people that work at the Westwood store have gone above and beyond. They're patient, fun, generous with their time and really know their stuff. A+< /review>< resp>

Best store in town people are so kind and helpful. They have parking and back or at Ross and they paid for it validation and great customer service !  Look for David He will give you the best customer Service.< /Text>

<review>**Updating to say the manager Rosa called me back and was more helpful than the guy I spoke with on the phone. I haven't gotten my phone back yet, but at least I got a call back when she said she would call. I've tried to call them 3x's this morning and no one is answering the phone**

terrible customer service. Dropped my phone off on Monday, was told the tech was coming in at 2p, would look at the phone and call me, haven't heard from them. I called on Wednesday, guy who sounded like he just woke up answered the phone put me on hold for 10mins. I hung up & called back, new guy answered. When I told him they were going to call me with an update on my phone he said, "we would never do that, we would never say we would do that, it's against protocol" I said, "that's absurd, you're saying you would never call me with an update on my phone when you said you would??" he rudely responded with "it's ABSURD you would think we would do that! We have 100 phones per week here, what are we supposed to call with an update on all of them??"  I said, um, yes...it's your job, you're the phone company. Then I asked if he could help  me find out what was going on with my phone, he said no. I'm not a tech or customer service...uhhhhh, clearly. Apparently a message has been left..we'll see if I get a call back.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

They did their best try and fix my phone, but ultimately they gave me the run around with where to go.</Text>

<rate>1</rate><text>Waste of time... they should close the store since the employees don't really do anything.  I have a hairline crack in the glass covering my new Note 7.  I spoke to the customer care agents at HQ 5-6 times to ask for help in getting a repair.  They were very friendly and accommodating.  Everyone said the 14 day warranty and 30 day satisfaction guarantee will cover it, and I should be able to go into a store and get this resolved quickly especially since I'm within the 14 day window.
I book an appointment on the website for the Westwood location.  I get an email confirmation for the appointment.  When I walk in 15 mins. early and tell them I'm here for my appointment: "Sorry, there aren't any techs. working right now."  but, I have an appointment...."just come back tomorrow"  I made an appointment and left work early since I can't just pop in whenever.  "Well, we can't help you."  Well is there anything you can do, the Reps. at HQ said it should be a quick check and you will help me.  "Well, let me just look at the phone. <grabs the phone out of my hand>  Your glass is cracked on the back."  I know that's what I stated.  "Well you should have bought the insurance... we can't help you since it's damaged... you need to call Samsung."  I'm sorry, but when I talked to the HQ reps. on how to get this fixed they all said Sprint will cover it under the 14 day or 30 day policy.  "They are all wrong... they shouldn't tell you that... In my opinion the techs. will not authorize this.... sorry, we can't help you"....<walks away>  I call back to HQ to ask if I need to call Samsung, and of course, they say no... the store should have helped me and it's all logged in there system.... needless to say, each time I talk to HQ, I get directed to 3-4 different departments, each promising to help, and each eventually ending in a 'sorry, the <department> is currently closed, please call tomorrow during working hours"<//text>< pics>

If I could I would give ZERO stars. Jorge was the worst sales associate I have ever had. I have been phone less for three months and why? Because Jorge promised to order me a new iPhone 6 because my phone was broken. He lead me on and kept telling me to wait and wait and the phone was on its way. I waited and waited. Then I realized that Jorge was doing me dirty and was lying the whole entire time. I celebrated my birthday without a phone because Jorge told me "the phone is on its way". I finally decided to come into the Wilshire Sprint store (which I completely recommend to everyone) and they helped me and did an amazing job and everyone who works here is so supportive and helps you right away. Hank, Mickey, and Leon all helped me through my transaction and helped me transfer everything from my damaged phone onto the new phone I purchased. In all, Jorge and everyone else at the Ohio and Westwood location are no help and LIE to you and do you dirty. I HIGHLY recommend everyone to come to the Wilshire and Brockton location for anything.</text>

Dunno about salesmen here, but Patrick in the tech department is the most helpful and friendly employee at any Sprint store I've ever visited. I travel out of my way to get his help.< /review>

My phone's lcd is broken, Walked in to the store and placed an order for a phone replacement, they told me the phone will arrive in 3 days and they will call me once it has arrived, it has been 5 days and no call from them,  every time i called them they put me on long hold for 15 minutes and when i ask for technician he is not avaliable and i have to leave them a message,  technician never return my messages either,  finally i went to the store to get a refund on my order today and found out the phone was there the whole time. Careless employees caused me to be with out the phone. Very bad customer service,  i don't recommend sprint to anyone and i will switch my service.< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I've been a Sprint customer for many years now. Couple times a year I go to the sprint store in the valley, to check out new phones and if it worth getting a new one. This time I went to the Westwood store . Everything was fine I was just looking around , and then finally made a decision to get the note 5. Right at that moment one of the employees comes up asking if I need help I said yes I want a new phone. He sat me down asked my name number..... After that he was just dazzled and confused just looking at the screen or texting on his phone completely ignoring that I'm sitting right in front of him. Then after all that all he says is "your not eligible" I said yes I know that already , I said I just wanna pay off my phone and start a new 2 year payment plan with a new note 5. He said ok then started dazzling off again and texting on his phone . So what I wanted to do is pay half by card and half by cash to pay off my old phone. So when I said that he tells me I have to call them and pay it off then come back . I had couple more questions but he just left me and wondered off so I had no choice but to leave. I went to a different Sprint store and everything worked out good. But yea this guy was a disaster he was like 5 9ish got like blondish ginger look to him he had a wedding ring too I think. But I feel bad for Sprint that they are clueless about their workers who treat their costomers bad. Good luck</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>They were able to accommodate my renters the same afternoon.
Repaired a short in the ac/heating system.
Thankfully it was a small job, and they absorbed the service call fee.They did a good job, guaranteed for 30 days.
They did want to sell me a service plan...I m not too keen on spending money on things that aren't broken.
Over all good  experience.< /Text>< user_id>

Showed up when promised - that’s a BIG one for me. Constant communication. . Juan answered any and all questions I had.  We made joint decisions on where things would be installed. Very willing to accomodate as much as possible.  Installation was quick and clean and he stepped me through the finished product. Very thorough.  System is running great!  Thanks CWP!< /Review>

We called CWP HVAC around 3pm after waiting 5 hours for another company that never showed up. They said a technician will be there within the hour. Franklin got here about 4:30, replaced the capacitor on condensing unit and was finished in 45mins!  He also found some flue pipe from the furnace and HW heater that was not up to code! It still had some asbestos pipe going through the roof and was not double wall pipe! We highly recommend CWP and will use them to replace the flue ducting.</Review>

The CWP guys are responsive, and provided the best price for service call out of the HVAC providers. The technician come out on the same day I call to schedule, and save us from the hot days upcoming. They were responsible and did a thorough inspection of my air conditioner HVAC unit. They identified the problem and gave me options about the fix. After the fix, our AC works well thanks to their service. Would strongly recommend.< /text>

Since we did not install your equipment nor do we service it on a quarterly basis, we could only give three options when encountering a scenario like yours. The first one would be to pressurize your system with nitrogen, find, repair the leak, replace filter dryer, pressurized with nitrogen once again to confirm leak has been repaired and charge with new refrigerant.\xa0This repair has a one-year warranty on parts and labor. The second option would be to add a leak sealer and add refrigerant, this option has an 80% success rate but still has no warranty. Lastly, third option would be to just add refrigerant with no warranty or guarantee. For $200 it almost sounds too good to be true. Some companies are using a drop in refrigerant which is not recommended by manufacturers. Systems will appear to cool until they don’t anymore and the compressor fails. We do not use drop in refrigerant for any system. Please contact our office and we would be happy to refund the service fee.'}< /Resp>

I called CWP to fix my furnace, once it was fixed they determined my furnace was producing low levels of carbon monoxide. Bottom line, I decided to replace my furnace. They did a great job replacing my system and I qualified for $3000 incentives. Thank you for your great work.</Review>

I needed some repairs done on my air conditioning, I called a couple of different places in the area and CWP was the only company to return my call. They sent a technician out and fixed the problem within 3 hours.

I strongly recommend CWP, they were very professional and prompt. I am a happy customer, and will use them again.< /Review>

This place is absolutely awful.  Constantly running out of ice cream,  their blender to make shakes is always broken and and the employees expect a tip.  ITS YOUR JOB TO MAKE ICE CREAM IF YOU WANT A TIP GO WORK AS A WAITRESS.  Good thing The Stand is a couple  stores down their shakes are to die for.  Here is your tip fix your blender and stop running out of ice cream.</review>

<Review>I love ice cream, this is a great place to get ice cream. They mix in the topings right in front of you on this big cold slab. Everyone that worked there was friendly and helpful. This was my first time there and I surely will be back. I got some gift cards for the kids in my family and I am sure they also will enjoy the ice cream. Highly recommend</Review></record>

<text>I loveeeeeee cold stone! I absolute favorite place to go for dessert or just have a little something extra tasty:) My two favorite flavors are cheesecake, chocolate  and mixing it with sugar cone pieces plus marshmallows:):):) absolutely fantastic thing to do ever! Always get a warm welcome and good service during the week but I will say during the weekends it’s definitely more livelier little bit more and it’s kind a pack sometimes depending what time we go but overall the wait is never long.

It’s a good place to go treat yourself or just going with some friends or family or create your own tub of ice cream and take it home. Whatever the case cold stone is the best and is definitely my number one for ice cream!<//text>< pics>

Bugs in their food. ZERO stars deserved. Must be new owners. Worst experience. We walked out and refused to buy anything. Don't go here. Go to baskin' robins. At least they don't have bugs in their ice cream.</Text>

Our server was bunk. This was the only time I was not super excited to eat my creation. It was still ice-cream, but not like all the other Cold Stones!< /text>

< Review>
Terrible... The woman kept on pushing us around and kept on asking my friends and I if we were gonna buy anything or if we're ready. She was saying it like if you're not gonna buy, get out. We got disgusted with her attitude and walked out. You're not supposed to treat customers this way, and we were actually considering buying until she gave us attitude</Review>

This is now the second time in a couple of months where I've ordered off the menu, noticed that it didn't seem to be prepared correctly, and when I asked about the discrepancy, was told it was made correctly. I'm currently staring at a Cookie Don't You Want Some with no caramel sauce and no fudge sauce, which is like half the add-ins. Look, I can understand making a mistake. But don't lie to me about it. I don't think I'll be coming back to this location. The customer is not respected here.< /text>

Good workers with good manners. We had them changing the valves and replace/install new faucets. Tidy and no mess. Punctual and reasonable pricing. We will call them for for future plumbing works and recommend them to friends and neighbors.<//text>

<Text>We just moved into a home with a 20-year-old water heater. I called Expert Plumbing and Talal got right back to me. His brother Mo stopped by that afternoon. They had a customer cancel for an install the next day and they scheduled us for installation. Mo explained the options. A 40-gallon conventional tank was the best solution for us. Mo returned the next day, removed the old heater and installed the new one. He arrived right on time and completed the job in 1 1/2 hours. The old water heater was not up to code, e.g. no pan under the heater, as well as some bad connections.

Their customer service, knowledge and professionalism is outstanding. They are a small family-owned business and you can tell they care about their customers. We will certainly use them for future plumbing work.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoVXF9K8-OEfB8cUHv20WFGIAYkRKzcvEj9oHU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>{'time': 1518134912339, 'text': 'Thank you, Bill.\n\nWe really appreciate your business, and appreciate you taking the time to share this wonderful review regarding our business.

I was so impressed with the outdoor shower installation they did for me.
They knocked it out of the park!  This is the fifth job they did for me and as always, they were very professional and courteous. I highly recommend them for all of your plumbing needs.< /Review>

From the initial phone call to the on site work these experts were top notch.  The bid came in almost immediately and even in these demanding times they manged to come right out and do a temp fix so we could have water till the scheduled much more extensive work could be done. (none of the other 3 bidders offered that solution)  The cost was more than competitive and the personal customer service was over the top.< /review>

We just moved in and wanted to replace our older electric water heater and dryer with propane models. Expert Plumbing was excellent. Talal and his team did a first-class job, running the new propane lines, handling ventilation and installing the new water heater all in one day, while not missing any small details and leaving the home just as clean as when they got there! They are definitely the people to call if you need anything plumbing-related in this area!<//Text>

<Review>This company knows what they are doing! Everyone was extremely professional and pleasant to work with. I had an urgent water leak emergency from a faulty valve in the kitchen and a bad pipe in the ceiling wall.  Expert Plumbing came out twice on very short notice to stop the water damaging my house and resolve the issues quickly. They not only fixed the issue, but really appreciate that they prioritized my case although there were other emergencies they were dealing with at the time. Both Moe and Talal were excellent, and they are VERY good at what they do. Thank you!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808e36ac563083c9:0xb008d2264bbb610c</GmapID></record>

We have done quite a bit of remodeling on our house so have used several local plumbers, and Expert Plumbing is the best we’ve seen. Leah was super helpful and friendly and got us an appointment within 24 hours. Talal, also very cordial and knowledgeable, gave us an immediate quote with various options and scheduled our repair for the next day. I didn’t meet the guy who did the install, but my husband said he was exceptional. I would recommend this company without any reservation!< /text>

Had an issue with a broken shower - Leah was super responsive and friendly, and Moe was quick to show up!

The next day we noticed a few things were still a little off and they were quick to send Talal out to fix it up with a better replacement part at no extra charge. Really appreciated them taking the extra steps to make sure it was all done well!< /Review>

Professional, thorough, responsive, and incredibly patient with us as we nailed down exactly what we wanted.  Come installation day, they arrived at the promised time, communicated precisely what they were going to do, and finished much faster than I would have anticipated, letting us know about a little bump they encountered and explaining the resolution.  They left our facility as clean as they found it.  All this and also reasonably priced.<//Text>

<Text>The only reason I gave them one star is because they did come soon.
He got advance of the time because the water was leaking and we had to shut the water ASAP and he knew whatever price says we have to accept it and for 15 minutes of his time just to connect 2 water pipe together he charged us $447 and when I asked him to run it over the door he said it will take more time and hours and there will be extra charge and I said just close it right now.
Now I have to call another company to come and move it over the door the way I wanted to.
I’m sure if he would do it it would have cost me over $1000
I will never ever use this company again.</Text>< response>

The nice thing about being a repeat customer is you know what to expect. Prompt response, great service and clear explanations of the work to be performed.  In a word - trustworthy.

7/7/2020: Another project "expertly" completed!

Thanks again Talal and team!

<Text>Expert Plumbing was the only service who could get to me the day of our plumbing disaster.  Technicians and office staff were friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable.  The plumber who came out worked up a sweat, stayed positive and friendly while spending several hours fixing our problem.  Unfortunately, we had issues a few days later, but Mo (owner) came out and personally attended to our difficulties, with no additional charge.  I would definitely recommend these guys.  Experts all around!  Thanks.</Text>< time>

<Text>I kept seeing Mo on my street doing other work and finally asked for an estimate to bring my water heaters up to 2016 CA Plumbing Code standards.

The tanks were close, but Rental failed to provide me with the standards prior to inspection and one item was missing that was not on the checklist. Failing reinspect is not an option. Did I have time to do it myself? Nope.

During the inspection process, Mo's brother, Talal, went over what needed to be done, including Permit requirements missed by Rental. To which I anxiously agreed. Failing reinspect is not an option.

Their estimate was $2-3k below the only other bid. So, GREAT.

Mo showed for the job on time and did everything needed. Now we move to Permitting and Reinspect feeling rather calm.

Availability, cost, promptness and pleasant dealing were all pluses. I'll use them again!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1570372890288, 'text': 'Hi Scott,\n\nThank you so much for this amazing feedback and for taking the time to share your positive experience with Expert Plumbing.\nMoe will be very happy to read your review.

<Date>1591062914499<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><text>They live up to their name. Do not hesitate to call Expert Plumbing for any plumbing issues. They are caring and truly compassionate people. The water heater here had a very celebrated life, and I’m so grateful it lived 13 years! For the last few weeks it had been leaking and forming a pool of water through the drain pipe outside. Sheltering-in-place for the last few months, the leak was overlooked it until the pilot light went out. A cold shower later lead to awareness of flooding at the rim. I called Expert, who helped me light the pilot light after troubleshooting, since the usual way wasn’t working. I mean how could it, since it was flooded with water and also trying to die. Talal helped with somehow, miraculously starting the pilot for access to hot water until the company could schedule a visit. Once this was done Jacob, one of the gentleman who worked diligently for hours (I’m sorry I didn’t get the name of the other coworker) stayed to troubleshoot why there was reduced pressure in the faucets. Instead of just fixing and leaving, he put on pandemic gear (much appreciated) and explained the cause of sediment buildup at the very tip due to the process of turning water on and off. He's very courteous and is a great teacher about cause and effect. In my lifetime, I have learned that no one can teach anything unless that person 1. loves what they teach, and 2. is an expert in that field. Talal and Jacob were really courteous and total gentlemen. We are so blessed to have them here. My mom is ecstatic about recommending them to everyone. We’re both so grateful for the problems Talal noted and ensured were fixed with lightning speed. A plus company! Oh their scheduling colleague Leah is really personable as well. I appreciated the level of care to adhere to to minimize transmission during these times while working in a small space. Super job.👍< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1591766589621, 'text': 'Thank you so much Hani for the amazing and wonderful feedback. We really do appreciate your business.

My experience with Expert Plumbing way exceeded my expectations, which is remarkable given that they had to hunt for a leak in a very old house. They methodically and patiently found the leak and repaired it in record time. Talal is one of the most professional service providers that I've ever used. I found him to be patient, prompt and extremely knowledgable and most importantly he genuinely cares about his customers. I've used Expert Plumbing before and I will use him again...happily!<//Text>

My water heater stopped working yesterday.  I needed it replaced quickly in my rental unit since an elderly couple lives there and I did not want them inconvenienced for too long.  I called Expert Plumbing at 12:30 pm, they were on site within a couple of hours and I had a new water heater before the day was out.  A very professional job, the installation so far appears to be flawless, Talal, the installer was nice and courteous, I would definitely recommend their service.</review>

Expert Plumbing always quickly responds to my phone calls and schedules an appointment in a timely manner. The plumbers are always super courteous. They do a great job fixing the problem ASAP at fair, reasonable rates. In the past, I've had to call a plumber back because the job wasn't fixed the first time. Never do I have to do that with Expert Plumbing!< /text>

<text>Expert Plumbing was great-- very professional and efficient.

< review>
We are putting our home on the market to sell and contact the team at Expert Plumbing to help us with the required sewer line inspection. We called Expert Plumbing and Talal & Moe did an excellent job and handled the process for us from start to finish. They dealt with the county inspectors (something I did not want to deal with) and kept us informed throughout the process. Thank you Expert Plumbing. We will be calling them once we purchase our new home.
Highly recommended.<//review>

These guys are awesome. They are exactly what I needed when I had two separate problems with my faucet and garbage disposal. They were very communicative throughout the entire process and prompt. Also, quite knowledgeable about several processes that would make first time home buyers like me quite nervous. They were very reassuring and did a great job!</review>

<review>After much research and recommendations, I decided to go with Expert Plumbing, a locally owned and operated business.

Talal, one of the owners and a technician himself, came out and gave us an estimate on replacing two very old toilets with the newest Kohler toilets.

Estimate given and accepted at 9:15 am. Aaron, another fabulous technician/plumber of Expert Plumbing arrived at 10:45 am (same day) with our two new toilets. He carefully inspected both areas; cleaned and reinspected areas and installed new carriage bolts, waterlines, wax seals and shiny new commodes. Caulked around the new units, and hauled away the old "units". Work completed at 1:00 pm...just as promised and scheduled. He didn't rush the job and was very meticulous about his work.

They treated my house like it was their own. I would have given them 6 stars if that were possible. They are my new go-to for all my plumbing needs.

Amazing quality of workmanship along with friendly and professional service!

Thanks again to Talal and Aaron for such great customer service!</review>< user_id>

<text>They charged me over 200$ an hour that said, the mechanic did a good job but  the owner was UN-yeilding on his price. You see when they show up they list the work and give you an estimation that you have to sign however, you don't know how long the work should take. If you watch them doing the work you find out the estimation you signed was an inflated amount of money , our  job costs were over 200$ dollars an hour. They must think their lawyers.You shouldn't bid on repair work but rather charge an marked up hourly price. The way this company does their bids, isolates then from competition.< /text><Name>Chris Beaty< /Name>< Pics>

We are glad to hear that your experience with the technician and the workmanship were positive.\n\nAs the owner of Expert Plumbing, I take every review seriously, and I would like to address your concerns. As I mentioned to you over the phone, we do not charge hourly for our services, so stating that we charge $200 per hour would be inaccurate. We always give a bid upfront, prior to starting any work and ask that the customer approves and signs the bid, allowing us to move forward. I often encourage customers to get other bids if they are unsure about our pricing because I know that we do offer competitive prices, and the BEST service. Chris agreed for us to start the project and he expressed how happy he was with our technician's work. Our technician completed the job, and in addition, he assisted with a few other extra tasks that we DID NOT charge for. There was a request to negotiate the price after the job was completed so I spoke with Chris on the phone to address his concerns. My goal is to make every customer happy and I'm disappointed that we were unable to do so in this case.\nI hope that Chris gives us an opportunity to provide more services for him again in the future.\n\nSincerely,\nTalal of Expert Plumbing"}<//Resp>

EP did a great job on a potentially risky gas leak. They responded quickly during a very busy time. They estimated the work accurately, and then showed up and finished on time.

<review>We have had Expert Plumbing do several jobs at our house.  Each time, they have gotten back to us, and scheduled an appointment at a time convenient to us, showed up on time, and have given us tons of information about our plumbing situation, explaining the details of all of the available options.  The company is 2 people only, both extremely trustworthy, so there are no worries about co-workers not having the same expertise as the owner.

They work hard and get a lot done in a decent amount of time.  If you have a question,  if it involves looking at something,they will make a trip back over to your house and answer it in person.

They are excellent resources for choosing appliances, and tell you exactly what the pros and cons are of each brand.  Also, they are very easy to be around, showing professional respect for your living space and both very pleasant people.

They have fixed a water pressure problem that was about to burst some pipes, checked a shower that was leaking ( and advised that replacing it might become a remodel, something a lot of contractors would have not explained ahead of time),
They also helped us buy 2 toilets, a kitchen sink and faucet and a dishwasher, and once we had bought those items, they picked all of those items up, brought them over here and installed all of them in  one day, with just one of them here working very quietly, and on that same day, bringing a water heater  up to earthquake preparedness code.

This company focuses on the job it is doing at the time.  They keep in touch with each other by phone if they are on separate jobs, so you are getting the benefit of the knowledge of both.  We felt like we were always in the loop, knew what they were doing, and why, and did not have to spend anything we did not choose to spend from a wide variety of options.  There have never been any unexpected costs with those two.  They advised us how to get good deals, and everything looks very sturdy and attractive.  They also told us how to keep the appliances looking brand new.  They used extra caulk and made everything very secure.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

We love Talal and his brother! They installed a tankless hot water heater for us and it's been perfect. He is very competent, reasonable, and affordable. He is also a pleasure to work with. He has become our go to guy.< /Text>

<review>Expert Plumbing... Thank you guys for saving the day!!! I came home to water running out of the garage and down my driveway. My water heater broke and leaked everywhere. Talal came out that same day and replaced it for us. Thank you so much for the quick response. Highly recommend using these guys.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Let me start by stating I have used other plumbers in the past and never had an experience this bad. These two brothers quoted me an arrival time of 10am and he shows up an hour and a half late, no call, no apology. After seeing my sink faucet not dispensing water properly he beats on it with a hammer for 30 minutes then tells me that the faucet isn't working and he has to make a call and he steps outside. He never comes back!!! I thought maybe he went for lunch. By 2:30 I call the business number and leave a message. Then around 4:30pm I leave a Yelp review explaining what happen. These bozos call me at 5pm stating there was a miscommunication and they think the review was unfair. I'm sure wasting my entire day was fair. Again no apology, completely unprofessional and not accepting ownership that they completely failed. Then they write on Yelp that I was the only unhappy party at the residence, which was a complete lie otherwise I'm sure the landlord or my gf would have written them an outstanding review. I think if you cared about your small business you would do everything you can to ensure the customer is happy, not these brothers. At no time did they apologize, or admit there lack of communication or professionalism is what caused this failure. I would if you like having your time wasted, by two unprofessional liars then these two plumbers are for you, otherwise I would say stay far away. Sad and pathetic are the only way to describe Expert Plumbing, its laughable the only thing there where experts in was complete and total failure.<//review><user>108996384694941383685<//user>< Pics>

I was out of town when my tenant texted me to say there was no hot water to her unit. I first called another plumbing co. that the HOA uses and had them come out. 2 trips and the water heater was still not working and said it would be several days to get the parts and couldn't tell me the price. I immediately searched Yelp and found Expert Plumbing and all the great reviews. While I'm usually still a bit skeptical with Yelp reviews, I had nowhere else to turn. Talal answered the phone right away and I got the feeling I was in good hands. He was able to get right out and assess the water heater. In the end, it turned out it was better to replace it rather then repair it. Talal was very professional and communicated with me via text the whole time keeping me apprised of the costs and timeline. My tenant also commented to me how professional they were. While I can't compare prices to other plumbers as I had no other estimates to go by, I can say I am extremely happy with how quickly they were able to resolve the problem. Hot water = happy tenant and happy tenant = happy landlord :) I will definitely be calling Expert Plumbing again when the need arises.<//text>< UserId.>

I called Expert Pluming on a Wednesday morning before work about our leaking water heater. Talal called me back within 15 minutes and was able to stop by soon after to assess our situation. We had an old propane water heater located precariously in the attic. Talal walked me through all the options and estimated costs. We knew it was going to be a big project because we wanted to eliminate the attic option and install a new water heater into an outside workshop shed. Talal was able to schedule it for the very next day so we wouldn’t have to be without hot water for very long. I was very grateful to not only have hot water but to get a new water heater installed in a safe location by Thursday night. I will definitely call again!< /review>< Pictures>

<text>I recently had my kitchen sink back up severely and gave Expert Plumbing a call based on their Yelp reviews. I was truly impressed by the level of professionalism and service I received! I've had mostly bad experiences with contractors and tradesmen so I try to do all of my own "handyman" type jobs. This job got over my head after unsuccessfully trying to snake the sink myself. This experience with Expert Plumbing was quite the opposite of the negative ones I've had in the past 6 years of owning my home. Talal came out on short notice and rescued me. I was leaving for several days and really didn't want to leave my family at home without a kitchen sink. He started from the lowest level of intervention and worked his way up to adding a cleanout and replacing some archaic plumbing from the backside of the sink. After a lot of work and about 90' of snake he was able to break through what ended up being one of the worst clogs he'd ever seen. Talal is not only a very technically skilled and experienced plumber, but one heck of a nice guy! I'm typically a little skeptical of inviting strangers in my home but I'd gladly turn over my house keys to him knowing I can trust him in my house and with my family. Expert Plumbing will be coming back to replace some nearly sixty year old cast iron pipe in the near future to prevent similar problems. I'd sooner go without a kitchen sink again than use any other plumbing company. I highly recommend Expert Plumbing and was blown away by the service I received. You won't be disappointed.</text><UserId.>105096951872609905879</UserId.>< user_name>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>We recently purchased 4 major appliances at this HD, and I wanted to recognize the AMAZING support by Cathleen and Rich in the appliances dept. From the moment we walked up to them with questions, to the in-store ordering process, and all the way to ensuring we got the best in everything, the 2 of them went above and beyond to deliver incredible support and customer service. They made the process seamless and low-stress. Cathleen and Rich are an asset to this company.

If you’re looking to buy new appliances, ask for them! Thanks again, Cathleen and Rich! :)</review>< Pics>

It's bad enough when parking is small also removed because of construction work being done here.. I get it but this is beyond normal thinking and Home Depot should be doing something about it. Not 1, not 2 but 3 spots.and My tru is the same size....< /text>

Not a great visit for me. The cashier in  the gardening department was having a conversation about how she didn't like vaccines, and how Chinese people were reinfecting Italy. I excused the conversation, because the other customer seemed to be trying to brush it off, and honestly it was none of my business. An older gentleman walked towards her register which finally had her head that way. She was extremely polite and engaging with him, but this completely changed when I get to the register. The lady didn't even say the word "hello." I was looked at as if I was bothering her. As I left, I heard her engaging an older lady with the same politeness that the previous gentleman had received. You should send people in their 30s to secret shop this woman, unless your standard is to discourage "younger" people (30 isn't too young), to shop there. At the very least she shouldn't have those conversations so loud at work, and she should say "hello."< /Text>

Cleaner than most other home depots, less crowded on a Saturday afternoon as well. We found the staff to be helpful in our quest to find some gardening supplied like trellises. You'll find pretty much all the other standard home depot products and services here. If you don't fin+ something, a Lowe's is pretty close by.< /Text>

Get what you need right away instead of waiting for amazon's delivery. Quality products unlike some of Amazon's. Sorry amazon, but it's true.<//Text>

The main problem at this time is all the construction near the store. Parking is limited as a big chunk of the lot is roped off. Other than that it's a decent home depot, not as chaotic as some of the other stores.<//Review>

People visit this home depot location because it's the closest one, not because it has particularly good selection. The staff is entirely unhelpful, so come knowledgable about what you want to do. Simple things like finding a specific light bulb are either impossible to get staff help with, or they take forever to do it.</text>

I ordered some wood floor. When we set the order, they said it’ll be arrive in 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, when we check the order status, they said it needs 1 more week. They said the 2 weeks are ESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE. They don’t have any responsibility to that. They start playing wording games about “ESTIMATED DATE”. They refuse to cancel the order and still charge penalty for refund.< /text>< Response>

<Text>The only reason I gave them 1 star is that there is no way to give zero stars. I made six visits to get shades installed, and still haven't succeeded yet. Their staffs are so quick in hooking you up, with sweet promise, "oh of course, we'll install it right after you purchased the shades". And once you pay, they became indifferent. Literally the lady said, after I waited for a week for the installation scheduling call, "Oh you only waited for a week though." To note, it's not waiting for installation, but for scheduling the installation. I'll avoid them at all cost.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808fb66a68f49b59:0x6dd5ad9d66eae13d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Everything you need under one roof. I particularly like their wide collection of lighting systems.
The reason for 4 star and not a 5 star is because its really hard to find what you need without store assistance. They do have specialist assistants for each department but you have to wait to talk to them during peak hours. The other area is the play nursery has  good collection of cacti, flowering plants, patio pots and home garden herbs. The staff are very friendly . Its great place if you exactly know what you need< /text>

Beware of people rushing in and out of the parking lot, there's only one way in and out and for some reason people seem to drive very aggressively when entering and exiting the lot. Some of the aisles are very crowded.  huge carts with product left in aisles, made it extremely crowded and hard to shop certain areas. I still like this home depot, I've been coming here for years. Just wanted to make people of what I know they will experience< /Review>

Update: Eventually, after multiple attempts I was able to get hold of a person that was able to help.

Do not order at this store, you will regret you did and if you do receive your order you will wait months.
I made the mistake to order windows at this HD and after they were over a month late I called just to be hung up upon or placed on hold until I gave up (>20min). This store just does not have it together!
Again, I am only rating this specific store. I have not had similar issues at the Bollinger HD in Cupertino. This review is specific for the Kifer HD.</review>

<Review>Like most Home Depot stores, this one can get quite busy and not have enough associates to help you. But when you are able to get, they can be very dedicated to answering your questions and finding you solutions. Overall I still really enjoy shopping at this location and always finding products for DYI projects. Also thanks for working through these difficult covid19 times and keeping us safe with plastic guards at checkout. See images<//Review>< Time>

What happened to Home Depot? We went to purchase a washer and dryer, kitchen set, and carpet. One worker walked right by us, said nothing, and sat down at a desk. Other workers completely ignored us.  Completely unacceptable. Home Depot you just lost about $20k-$25k in sales. Stupid.</Review>

Friendly helpful employees that are knowledgeable in their respective departments. Wayyyy better experience than going to Lowe's. They have a large inventory for all your home improvement needs.

We ordered flooring here (they give out sample blocks for you to take home and match the coloring). We also had several keys made here - they use a machine to laser cut then so there is better accuracy and less probability of getting a key that doesn't work.

Pro tip: buy coupons on eBay before large purchases for savings up to 20%<//review>

Mid morning and mid afternoon seems best if you need someone to help.  The reps at the tools and hardware section seems very experienced.  I showed one a stripped screw from a chair and he could tell right away the size and threading.</review>

<Time>1591064446694<//Time><review>I came to purchase washer and dryer today. This is my second time coming for purchase.  There is no one helping in appliances area. Thanks to the help from kitchen design lady. She's nice and helpful. The rest of staff are cool and helpful except for a lady who manages the payment. She is very dominate and did not allow my to use credit card new user coupon. Finally I canceled the order and purchased it onlien with no problem. I do hope she could be more polite and work on her on business better instead of being dominant to customers. Anyway, appreciate your service of all staff in store at this time being.< /review>< GmapID>

Went to HD with my girlfriend for some supplies. The product we were looking for was not where it was supposed to be (something else was shelved there but mislabeled) and none of the associates we found were willing/able to help find what we were looking for. On the website it said there were 161 of the product in the store, so we placed an online order for store pickup. Several hours later, Home Depot cancelled the order because the store actually didn't have any on hand. While we were looking around we also found this attempt at a shelf repair. Disappointing.</review>

< review>
I usually find what I need. If I can't, there is usually an employee that can help. It's just that every time I go in there, it feels kind of depressing. Sure, most are in a hurry to get in and out, but it's sad that the employees look so miserable, and they are, thanks to the poor, overbearing big-corporation management style that pours down upon them. The corporation's unreasonable, excessive demands on its managers rains down upon it's base employees. The customer comes first? Wrong, efficiency/work flow statistics, and money come first. Employees are told to not do a good and through job. They are instructed to just get it done fast and dirty so the store stats look good in the reports to the district bosses. No pride allowed in job well done here! They are even told to avoid helping customers because it makes the daily efficiency stats go down. I know, I worked in a similar environment at Lowe's. It's mind boggling. What happened to, a good employee is a happy employee, who makes the customer happy, who most likely will come back and happily spend more money? I could go on, but I fear I  may be approaching a character limit of sorts. All I'm saying in this segment is, try to give the employees a little break. Misery is forced upon them. It's not all their fault:)
Mostly because this is too long, and a bit off the beaten path of a typical comment, I would understand if this does not get published. Nevertheless, to whom it may concern, I enjoyed writing it:) Cheers<//review>

<review>It's another home depot - I guess they are overrun these days with folks staying indoors. Have a good assortment of home improvement stuff - we go for the plants and gardening stuff mostly. Off late the stock has dwindled and not sure how often they're able to replenish so haven't been able to get some of the things we went for. Ample parking.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Pros: Helpful stuff, you could pick almost anything you need for DIY at home
Cons: Choice is somehow limited, e.g. only one specific tool from single manufacturer. Online order could propose you to pickup something from specific location (and show good enough stock), but in reality that item might be missing.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Tried their curbside pickup for buying a TV mount and highly recommend it. More about my experience below:

I placed an order through the website requesting curbside pickup. I was provided an order number and a link to provide details for logistics. After I parked the car in the curbside pickup spot - I shared the parking spot and car details at the link. About 10 min later, the store employee got my order out to my car.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The curbside pickup has no people outside to meet you. I had to go into the customer service line after waiting 15 minutes after tapping “I am here” on the order. Inside I noticed most of the employees wearing masks incorrectly, exposing their noses or nose and mouth. The customer service line is set up such that employees walk closely past customers constantly to get to computers and items. I would not come back until after Covid.</Review>

I paid for order at 2 p.m. on Sunday, then by 1 p.m. on Monday they were so disorganized in the line was so long that it wasn't even worth paying for anything online. Curbside nothing they do not have such a convenience. Lowe's and a bit more money is well worth the service and the visit.</text>

Very difficult to find help at any Home Depot location, including this one. We dread going to Home Depot., We know, if we go, we will spend over an hour. They've shifted to more self check-out which takes longer and is less efficient.  Customers should be careful before hiring the workers who stand outside.  Some contractors hire the workers standing outside the store as well.  There is a worker at this location (stands in the parking lot area) and the one on DeAnza that is skilled at remodeling bathrooms and kitchens amongst other things but he is an addict.  I had him in my home, and experienced  irrational behavior. Mid way through the project, he didn't return. Contractors who hire these people who stand outside, perhaps don't know their background.</Text>

They went beyond expectations when they gotten the Behr ultra paint from the top pallet for me. I thought they could have told me to use a cheaper Behr paint for the particular paint chip. Thanks y being helpful to me</text>

VERY VERY RUDE.
Went in store to ask about availability of sod for a lawn, and was only given vague and dismissive answers until the employee left entirely. Then I called the store about it because their website had conflicting information on it, and after being put on hold for 10 Actual minutes we were told she would run to ask someone and was subsequently hung up on. I then had my sister call about the sod again a few minutes later and after another 16 minutes of holding, she asked, “do you have sod available for pick up tomorrow?” And was met with “let me see” *click*.
Never before have I seen more blatantly untrained,  unknowledgeable, and downright rude customer service in my life. If you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for and exactly where to find it, do yourself a favor and avoid this store like the plague.</Review>

<text>Everyone knows about home depot.  One stop place for all your home making needs. Be it infrastructure or garden, they have it all. Better than any other place when you get the tools or gardening stuff. I also like the food truck tjat sits outside the store. Staffs are super helpful and courteous.  I definitely recommend it to everyone.  Check process is also fairly straightforward</text>< rating>

<Review>You pay $50 for someone to come to your house to give an estimate for flooring installation on Monday. You are promised someone will call you back by Wednesday to give you a time to be home in Friday.
On Wednesday and on Thursday, you still haven’t received any calls.
On Thursday evening, you call Home Depot and is put on hold for 15 minutes for someone to tell you that there is no one at the flooring department available as someone called sick.

Home Depot doesn’t care about his customers.
I’d recommend anyone to avoid this Home depot.

This is not how you treat your customers. Please train your employees better so they know how to answer to their customers questions and concerns.

This is unacceptable.<//Review>< pictures>

I am Writing this review from my car while waiting for my item. I arrived at 3pm and was the only one in the curbside pick up location, they got my ordered and said will be right out. It has now been 55 min and nothing yet. I have been waiting here for 55 min and I think it might be longer. This is crazy insane amount of time to be waiting for 1 item. I learned my lesson go lot Lowe’s or if I need anything from the Home Depot I will get out of my car and get it myself. I am beyond frustrated with this service that is suppose to make your life easy  yet it’s disfuncional.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmapID>

5 stars for two workers who care,  I did wait sometime for the electrical person to show and open the tool gate, he she was no where to be found, a lady from appliances and the lift guy, jump to help after they saw I was about 40 minutes waiting to spend money.

The home depot is always an unpleasant experience. The employees are only concerned with themselves and looking out for themselves. Very unfriendly and obviously don't want to be there. But, the depot always seems to have something I need.<//Review>

<text>I asked 5 people for help and if you're picking up something curbside that's very heavy, this location does not give the employees to handle the sheer volume of business right now. I asked some employees and they said Home Depot has not given any raises for the insane amount of traffic this location gets. They are overworked and risking their lives in order to pay rent and eat. Why is Home Depot not making financial sacrifices for the good of their employees. These workers are working above and beyond and for what? The same pay pre-covid? So privileged people like me can build a flower bed in my yard? This is insane, our unfair class system at work.< /text><Rate>4<//Rate>< Response>

Ordered a ladder online said it was ready for pick up, got in a very long line. Was only one person working and she was really busy, another guy showed up and took about 10min to put his apron on it was not on the hour or half so he was working when he finally did start to help we were next was told the ladder was in a holding place in the back would take 10 to 15 min to get, there was no other help for up front and the other girl went outside to help someone and the line was starting to yell get help literally yell...lol he said he did call for help where was management lots of workers milling a round not really doing anything..I am handicapped so no really option to get ladder myself...store or acting manager should have been down to clean up this mess or at least helped returns and pick up need to be redesigned<//Text>

This store used to be quite unfriendly store, even to a point of belligerence by people who didn't seem to know too much. Past several visits are showing good signs of improvement s, especially Bill in the painting dept and John, I think, in the hardware section. Increasing to 4 stars now, from 2 before.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>The only reason I’m giving 5 stars so the  corporate know that they have a good mangers there

Came in after work to get a folding table for my party at home. One of the stuff who also was helping me get a copy of my keys told me where can I find the table at. So went and got one however ones I got to the self check the price was different then what I originally saw so I ask the  person  Who was there why is it different. He asked me to go take a picture of the serial number from where I pick it up. Took first picture wasn’t clear enough my bad so he asked if I can take another picture so I took and when he  I like it in the serial number it seems that the one I got was the 6ft and the price I saw was for the 4ft but there wasn’t anything there besides the one I got so I told him can I get the 4ft then he goes go find it. That’s when I lost it he made me go twos and get a picture for the serial number and now he’s telling me to go find something not there. I asked to speak to the manger. Omar the manger at that time came and I told him what happened he right the way do what a really manger do.  Acknowledge the problem  fix the problem. I really appreciate the customer service Omar< /Text>< pics>

OOS items strike again! Grade 8 bolts, check. Washers, check. Lock washers, check... Not only 2 nuts!!! I should just remember to drive twice as far for Lowe's.

How I miss OSH.

2/24/19 Home Depot strikes again! How are they out of bolts!!!

And done even try to find pluming fittings here unless you want to check every box for randomly misplaced parts.

Very bad experience by buying carpets & installation service  from this store . Initially , they never answer the phones. When I purchased the carpets I was informed by sales associate that installation time frame is 2-3 weeks which was changed to 4 weeks by the installer after 2 weeks from purchase time . Target property is rental & I'm contracted with tenant so one week could cause me money damages by not making the property ready to move in. I called many times( no answer) & finally by the help of corporate I could get  a hold of Gloria ( store MGR) who made a few promises to follow up on this & calling me back which she never did. This is the last time I  buy any services from home depot .</Text>

Pretty good store and surprisingly they have actual humans to help you find certain items in the store or if you have trouble with the self checkout registers. I felt bad interrupting a worker who was about to restock some items and he was friendly enough to patiently cut some wooden dowels for me.<//review>

Helpful staff had keys made. they have always worked and they have the large truck keys that i need.last time,I leave from Hayward and work in Sunnyvale. I needed some keys made. And stopped at all the Lowe's and home depots along highway 880 from Hayward to sunnyvale none of these stores had the keys i needed .so I go straight to home depot sunnyvale from now on, thank you home depot sunnyvale. A lot of time waisted at the other stores.< /Text>

No one to help in large appliance area. Customer service man did get the manager for me & he said I could only get the info I wanted by placing an order but not completing it & that's what the person there at Home Depot would do. Frankly I think he should have done it instead of all the warnings he was giving about ordering, accepting, & problems I would have if something was wrong & I wanted to return. Therefore I will not be getting my dryer through them even though the cost was a little less than other places.</text>

<review>Seriously stay away from this store. There’s a LOWEs right down the street. The staff here are incompetent, when you can actually find one to assist you. I have an online order to pickup and I have to stand in the same line as returns. The entire reason for online shopping is so that I don’t have to stand in line!! Not helpful, slow and a waste of my time!</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fb66a68f49b59:0x6dd5ad9d66eae13d< /gmapID></record>

They have almost everything here if you take the time to find it.
I needed new washing machine shut off valves and wanted the 1/4 turn ones but they only had the long stem ones.</Review>

There are two particular persons that I am very impressed with their services.  If you need to get an appliance at Sunnyvale Home Depot, you should talk to a guy named Mike (an older guy) in that department. This guy stayed more than an hour after the store closed to place my order and another customer behind me.  He followed through my order two times to make sure that it was totally complete.  The second person is named Angel (I think she is a customer desk lead.) When the delivery company called me 30 minutes before end of a day that it could not deliver my refrigerator for next day, I was so pissed.  She helped me for an hour to work through many different departments to get a compensation.<//Text>

<review>Good store but don't waste your time wandering the aisles looking for stuff; just ask someone in an orange apron.
Also don't order stuff online and pick it up here. My item took weeks to get to the store and now I'm standing here waiting because the person who may know how to find it is on break.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>It’s ok. Most people are helpful but often I’m left standing at the wood cutting station or garden station without help. Today specifically I couldn’t find a flat bed cart and anyone I asked shrugged or waved to another direction that had nothing. So when I went to check out with my 20+ bricks and 9 bags of soil I had to load and unload my cart for the cashier who was also unhelpful. I’m not asking them to lift my load- but they could call on the phone for a flat cart location for me to go get or even just HOLD THE CART so it’s not rolling away from me in line instead of signing with how long it takes me to load and unload it for them.<//text>< Pictures>

They were able to track down one little part that I needed. He walked right to the designated section found exactly what I needed. Every time I come here it’s an enjoyable experience. I think next time I’ll bring my friend to share the enjoyment that I have coming to this Home Depot. I think that the best Home Depot in the bay area Hass to be this one. Even the guy who help me whose name was Joe was a great person and a great persona. He talked about how this was his first real job. And that he was great for to have a job. And to help the customers just like me if I little parts that I needed. Next time I’ll come I hope I’ve see my friend Joe again thanks bye<//Review>< Pics>

I went there to pick up an order online. It took 45 minutes to retrieve the item. What is worst is the attitude of the cashier. She was literally staying there doing nothing. When I inquire about my order after 30 minutes, she became very impatient and yelled at me. What a rude person. Maybe she was ending her shift since it's afternoon? Not sure, but I will do business with Lowes in the future. Byebye Home depot</Text>

What a joke, needed a tap, well you don't have it and the clown in that dept is indifferent when I asked for help. Also recording customers binging to draw their attention to your cameras showing your being taped, if you had help and staffed that department better you would not offen you customers. Keep your taping system I won't be back online works for me</review>

<text>At 2:30 in the afternoon of the 18th, I was going to make a small purchase.  There was a long line waiting for self-checkout and one "manned" register with another long line.  Apparently, management couldn't be bothered about providing decent customer service. So, I set down my item & left, went home and ordered it online.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>Everything seems to move slowly at this store, and they never have quite what you need in stock. It's not terrible, but there is a Lowe's down the street that is far better-run.

<Review>I picked up my online order for a window screen, never used and decided to return it later. It was not until then that I found the product that I picked earlier was a used and return.
Of course they declined my return and accusing me for scamming. And they would never acknowledge their own mistake.

<Review>Staff are generally pretty helpful here. I also lost an item off my cart on my way to my car recently without noticing and they kindly replaced it is their expense. Overall I’ve had a positive experience at this store

This is in contrast to the East Palo Alto store where I get mixed-to-bad service. When given the choice, this is my go to store.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The driveway entrance at the front of the store should have speed bumps, because people come speeding into the parking lot- where people are walking to and from the front doors.

Also, the Pro Parking wasn't as clearly marked as Santa Clara.

Also, the Pick Up Desk was chaos. The employees stood about, looking at the customers grouping in front of them, but without offering assistance to the customers in front of them. There is no line marked out, so customers were cutting, by going straight to the desk and flagging an employee down behind the desk, meanwhile other customers stand in a line, waiting for a free employee to signal their readiness to take the next customer.

At least I can say that the employees were very nice when they were helping me.<//Text>

Excellent and helpful staff! With yesterday's massive amounts of rain, we urgently needed something to stop the water from coming under the doors. I called Sunnyvale's Home Depot at 8:40pm (when they close at 9pm!!) and they suggested what product could help us out. They were nice enough to hold it for us, keep their doors open for us a few minutes past closing time, and help us carry the stuff out to the car. Thank you for top service!< /review>

<review>On this day, home depot did a great job. I walked in to look for help and I saw a Filipino gentleman at the self-checkout and ask him where the concrete was. He pulled out his phone and checked and said I would find it on aisle 28. Because I was in a hurry and ran out of concrete this was a big help for me.

This store is notorious for terrible customer service.  I am a contractor for NASA and I no longer want my guys using this store.  They take forever and delay my men.  They never have online sales ready, they make the guys sit and wait.  The manager Yasenia is never available, always in a meeting and Eric the assistant manager just apologizes but never fixes the problem. I had an appointment with the flooring department and the woman made me wait 2 hours for help. I'm directing my guys to go to the East Palo Alto store, or better yet, Lowe's.< /Text>

The best place to go for this type of store, they always have knowledgeable and helpful associates available even though you have to wait a few minutes sometimes.  Still WAY better than Lowe's - and thanks to Lowe's closing all of the Orchard Supply stores, we are stuck with these two options.<//text>

Gets the job done, most of the time. I had so much pride when I worked for home depot and now it just feels dreary to walk through these old dilapidated stores. Really could use a facelife. At least Lowes isn't that far away when they don't have what I'm looking for<//text>

Super helpful staff. Always willing to help. If you need extra stuff that's on a pallet just make sure you ask for it as soon as you walk in. I've waited 1 hr before stock was brought down from the racks with a lift.< /review>

The Worst Customer Service.  Can't get any help in the store.  Waited at door counter for over 30 mins when told someone would be back in 10 mins, but employee never showed up.  Left a contact number, but never got a call back.  I've been on hold for 38 mins waiting to see if my blind order is in and I think they forgot about me.  In-fact my husband just decided to drive there while I'm on hold.    It's been months since I've been waiting for my blinds.<//Text>

<text>Aggressively pushing the Home Depot credit card with misleading claims!
The clerks were promoting discounts to everybody, without disclosing that the so called “Home Depot card” is in fact a credit card and not a loyalty card. The agent was super pushy and tricked me into opening one (when I did NOT want to), and did not give me any explanation or chance to understand what was happening.
This is VERY VERY bad practice, and Home Depot managers should be ashamed of this!<//text>< Pics>

It's a warehouse store with all that comes with that, but I like the tool selection and prices.  It's OK for basic raw materials. You'll have to hit specialty stores for some more specific needs or higher quality wood. Employee expertise is not good, but I wouldn't expect it to be at a warehouse store.< /review>

Great for contactors not so much for the home shopper. Customer service is pleasant. Buyer beware - if you buy something online ant return it in store for store credit, you can't use that money online NOR can you use that store credit to purchase a Home Depot gift card that you can use online.  NOR can you use that store credit to customer service order you something to be shipped to the store.  It's my understanding that Home Depot operated their own online store, it is unclear what the distinction is.<//Text>

<text>The worse service you can find. Called them 2 times in the past already and they've just put me on hold over the phone for the longest time. They do not have enough people or the first person whom picked up the phone were simply just blowing their customers off. I know when business calls have recordings letting you know that your calls mean important to them, whatever you say during the call even while on hold are being recorded.  And, during this second call being placed on hold for VERY LONG time, after I said over the phone that they are not doing their job and blowing me off over the phone, then the same customer service agent who first agreed to help me immediately picked up the phone again after hearing what I said.  Their service is terrible. They cannot just claim serving us is important to them when what they do is putting their customers on hold for a LONG TIME and asking customers to wait and hence waste customers time.  If they are busy, at least let us know they'll call us back or ask us to call them back.  Homedepot needs better customer service representatives or at least more people to serve their customers. It is clear that Customer Service is NOT important to them at all and they are misleading their customers all the time with jibberish. They just wasted a big business from me. I was looking to buy man made grass from them which would've brought them large amounts of money both for product and for installation.<//text>< Pics>

<review>This Home Depot is pretty typical of the chain. We recently bought a fridge there and the employee we worked with made sure we got every discount available while maintaining a friendly and helpful demeanor (despite one of her co-workers being decidedly unprofessional). I've never had issues with checking stock online and picking up in store or anything and the employees are generally very helpful, though as with any store this size it's sometimes hard to find someone who is available to answer questions.< /review><UserId.>112896630675956599355<//UserId.>< resp>

<text>I have been shopping some small items from this store for last couple of years and got good experience with it; but tonight, when I came to buy a toilet valve seal because my toilet water leaked and I did not know much about that at first; I came to the store and asked two staffs who tried to move some stuffs; I explained it to them what problem I had and one asked the other younger guy to help but he wrongly pointed something totally different to me; he should pay attention to my explanation and he can easily help me out; either he did not have the knowledge or he did not want to really help. I had to leave  the store to a nearby Lowe's store and easily found out what I needed - a rubber seal for valve there. I am thinking I should come to Lowe's in the future all I need.</text>< Pictures>

Not a place if you need customer service.  No one seems to know what is going on when renting or ordering.  Better off going through amazon, it is faster.< /Review>

<text>Zero star was not an option hence couldn’t go lower.

Bought a Samsung Washer-Dryer (brand new) with all the paraphernalia. Was delivered on time but the dryer didn’t work from the first moment the delivery guys plugged it in.
The delivery guys blamed it on our supply. We just had moved into the house that we just bought so we weren’t sure. Surprisingly - for an electrical  appliance they didn’t have a multimeter so we couldn’t check that.
24 hrs later after buying a multimeter - we found out there is nothing wrong with our supply.
Called appliances delivery hotline and scheduled appointment. A guy came in 4 days after the complaint was lodged. Changed the control panel and it worked.

The whole customer experience with Home Depot has been frustrating.
When called they literally said “We are just store front”; the delivery & installation guys said “We just deliver” while Samsung’s customer care seems to redirect & redirect & redirect until you get frustrated and finally hang up.

This type of ordeal proves a point why stores like HD are struggling to survive and Amazon is ruling the world.<//text>< Rate>

So I went to my local HD looking for a power tool. I couldn't find it myself, so I checked their website site for it. The web site said they had one left. So I bought it online. They said I could pick it up in the store I was in! I walked to the Service desk and showed them the order. They said come back in about ten minutes. I walked around the store and came back in ten minutes. There was my power tool! After signing for it I picked it up and walked out!
That was the fastest online order I have ever made!!!
Good job HD!< /review>

Most if not all of my experiences have been good at this store.  True that some of the staff is above par and some... not so much, but its like that everywhere in our world today so don't be that surprised if things go a little south on the first try.   It all depends on who, when and where.  Be patient and if one associate is not that helpful, another one will be.   I would like to give praises to Stan, who is very, very helpful and knows hardware like no other.  Seek him out and you will get first rate, grade A help and service each and every time.  Cheers< /review>

This is my go to place for home improvement stuff. The staff is usually busy, too many people in neighborhood I guess. I do find my stuff very easily here and do not have to ask the store associates.< /Review>

This place has a huge selection for your home improvement needs.

I came for a clothing rack and found myself in a closet section but unable to find any racks. It was impossible to find anyone to ask for help, but an employee finally walked by. Upon asking for help finding said rack, she quickly told me she did not work in the department but will find someone to help me, before disappearing just ask quickly. I waited for a good 15 minutes wandering up and down the aisle before giving up.

The store itself and its selection isn't bad, but for a store of its size, the lack of service was aggrevating.< /text>

Even when I placed an online order for pick up, I had to call to find out what happened which then got them to pick the order and they gave me 2 wrong parts. I am beyond upset with the service in store. Their return line takes longer than usual. And if you ask for help, they only point you to the aisle, no help in actually finding the right part or discussing the project we are trying to do.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fb66a68f49b59:0x6dd5ad9d66eae13d</GmapID></record>

<Text>I had very bad experience with the paint department in Sunnyvale Home Depot today.

My contractor bought two 1-gallon bottles of paint of the same color. Surprisingly when he finished the first bottle and opened the second one, he found that the colors are actually quite different.

He brought the two bottles to the store and checked what's going on. The guy who made the bottle could not generate the color of the used bottle. He was able to make the one same as the remaining one though. This means, all the contractor work has been wasted, as we have to repaint with the new color. To our bigger surprise, the guy refused to admit it was his problem, so did his female manager (the woman I talked to later on in the afternoon). He said he can make us new bottles but wanted to charge us for the new ones! My contractor speaks very little English and got quite angry and called me.

So I was in store in the afternoon. On seeing me carrying the two bottles, a woman, who claimed to be the manager of the paint department, asked me why I was there. She was assuming things are settled, and the fault is on our side. I explained clearly what was going on, but then woman said that my contractor admitted he messed up the color himself. She said we bought multiple bottles and there happened to be two colors, and we faked the tag with the bottle and wanted to get free paint! I really admire her imagination but commented calmly that it was not the case. How can my contractor, who knows little English, explained so complicated things. Also, we only bought two bottles of paint throughout the entire re-modelling. I was quite annoyed and asked to talk to her manager. She said all the managers were having a meeting at that time, and no one was able to come and talk to me. I said I would wait until people show up. She seems got worried and finally agreed to refund us for one bottle, but still claimed it was not their fault. I did not have too much time, so had to accept the compromise. The moment the woman received the bottle, she swiped off the color label on the it. Now I fully understood she knew it was their fault, and wanted to kill the evidence immediately.

I would never go to that place and buy any paint in the future, and share my experience with all my friends.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>This is a typical Home Depot store. Friendly (though not necessarily highly knowledgeable staff, similar to other Home Depots). There is a good selection of everything home-improvement related, as you would expect. The parking situation can be a little difficult during the weekends, though it is rare that you fail to find parking at all.</review>< pics>

<text>As a new home owner, I finally understand and appreciate Home Depot.  Also, as someone who loves DIY projects, this is pretty much the playground of my dreams.

I have found the staff incredibly helpful and friendly.  I come in with questions about anything and everything relating to my home, and I always come out satisfied and a little poorer.  :)

This home depot is definitely my go-to for DIY home projects!< /text>< Date>

Do not shop from this store! Very rude and unhelpful associates and managers specially in the doors department. Worst purchase experience I ever had. The associate working at doors department ripped us off by making us custom order a standard size patio door from Milgard which took more than 4 weeks to deliver, and it wasn't even the right one!! After 8 weeks they still have not delivered the right door to us, so we had go ahead and buy another door from Lowes to make it to our inspection appointment. Now the store manager would not even take back the wrong door and refund our money. Flushed $1000 down the drain, wasted 8 weeks for a door that I had to purchase again for $400.
Most chaotic store ever seen!!!<//text>

Omg they are super unfriendly and unhelpful.  I went to buy paint, something I'm not familiar with. The staff said that it was $50 in a serious manner, then said,  "oh I'm just kidding".  I didn't understand how to get the right paint can to match the color and texture I want, and staff was condescending instead of helpful.  Now that I understand they mix it for me, it's obvious.  At checkout,  I was told I could checkout at customer service.  When I went there they confirmed so, but ignored me for a few minutes without so much as an acknowledgement I'm waiting for someone to help me.< /review>

You guys might be the best store but worst delivery especially with temco they are rude they only call me to let me know that they coming in 20 to 30 minutes but wont call you when they arrive..managers are always busy and wont accommodate the fact they made mistake...your customers are being treated wrong by temco< /review>

It's HD, what do you expect?

I will say, however, that I got the unexpected--an older gentleman in hardware, I believe, was very friendly, and went out of his way to help me find some styrofoam bucket inserts. Turns out they're online only, but the guy was really kind and knowledgeable. I'm glad to see some of the people here still care about customer service!< /text>

Ok store.  The store is ok.  Trashy outside and messy.  Watch your parking spots tons of messy contractors who dump old nails and screws.   Beware.  Worker are mostly worthless, it seems like they are understaffed or maybe they're all hiding.< /Text>

Customer service at the paint counter is terrible. First employee just walked away and said "I'm sorry," leaving me alone for several minutes before I had to go ask for help. Second employee was curt, third employee to help me was literally having a phone conversation as she assisted me.

One register open, long line. At least the store is clean and well stocked.< /review>

The HD at this location has some of the most incompetent cashiers. Lady, by the name of Kelley, tried ringing up my pro rewards card. Took her 15mins to ring up 3 items. She stated that she's been working at this location for the past 3 years. I suppose she didnt learn much from that amount of time. Not coming to this location again</Review>

Terrible.  I tried to buy a dishwasher.  I gave my order over the telephone.  They were wrong in taking my name down.  They failed to take my address down properly.  They left off the street number, of all things.  I straightened that by calling and asking why I had not received the purchase contract.

Then they failed to deliver the dishwasher.< /text>

when I opened the box of my new 6.9 cu. ft. Chest Freezer in White, I discovered damages.

I called customer service, they contacted to the store, store manager was agree to pick up the damaged one and delivere the new one, but they did not do it!

I called the store, now they are telling me that I have to return it to store and pick up the new one, because according to store I had to open the box and see if it was damaged before I take it home, but I am sure they already know that it is technically impassable to open the whole box of freezer to check the product and put it together again, so basically they do not want to solve the problem.

It has already been a week! we needed it quick, but we are still trying to get the new one. I am really dissatisfied!</review></record></dataset><record>

I drove 16 miles to this store because the website indicated it had the the pet version of the dyson vacuum I was looking for at a price competitive with Costco. I normally wouldn't purchase a vacuum at home depot, but as a veteran, the 10% veterans discount would make it worth it... or so I thought.
I got there and the vacuum wasn't there. After spending 15 minutes trying to flag down an employee, they confirmed there were 2 in stock but one of those was probably counting the display model and the other one was "probably still on the truck" and they wouldnt unpack it until after the store closed for the night. I asked if they would be willing to sell me the display model and they said no. I said I would really like to purchase it tonight since I drove  out of my way for this specific model. would they be willing to check the "truck"?  Nope. I said ok I guess I will take my money elsewhere.

Congrats Home Depot, you just turned down $450 in sales because you are too lazy to even LOOK!</text><user>102410512059188423450< /user><Name>Aaron Arnold< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Got delivered but not installed because they didn't put the note that lived at 2nd floor. They promised to come back the next day for installation but nobody showed up. I called HD and they gave me two numbers to call and none of them went through. I had to go to HD again on Thursday and they called the delivery for installation and the earliest date is the next Wednesday! This is not acceptable. So I ask for refund for the installation fee, and they call Temco for Authorization, was hold on the phone for more than 20 mins! I dont have a whole day just waiting for a refund less than 30 dollars! Highly not recommend if you want to buy appliance at Home Depot. Its a nightmare and no one want to take the responsibility if somethings went wrong.< /Review><Rate>1</Rate><Resp>None<//Resp>< Name>

Online inventory is never reflect actual inventory. It is a second time we came looking for a specific thing. The first time the worker was trying to help, and actually changed the inventory to  0. A week later new inventory shows up online, we came back to no result. This time, we ask for help and a different worker did not even try to help.< /review>

My family has shopped at home depot ever since I can remember but this location is particularly useless. Poor service, can't find ppl to help, and even the workers were gossiping how the store manager keeps changing< /Review>

Not always able to find things. Not that they are buried, just not carried.  Example this week, that little rubber strip at the bottom of shower doors.</Text>

If you call them, they cut you off when trying to put you on hold.

Want a basic $10 item that should be at any hardware store?  It's not at this Home Depot, but they will sell you a $99.95 alternative.

If you're looking for even the most basic hardware items, it's hit or miss whether it will be in stock.<//Text>

Home Depot is really going downhill. Shelves all jumbled and not an employee in sight. No way to know if the electrical parts I needed would work or how much they cost, since the SKU didn't match any tags.< /Review>

Someone actually came up to me and asked if I needed help, without me even looking for them! This never happens at Lowe's. Then he found me the part I needed to fix my sink. I spent 40 minutes and two trips looking for it at Lowe's yesterday, without ever encountering staff.</review>
