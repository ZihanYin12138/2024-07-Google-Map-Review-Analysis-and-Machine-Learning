**SCAM ALERT** I came here in an emergency after my tire became flat on the highway. I was charged about $470 to get all my tires switched out. When I came home after this extremely stressful ordeal, these people called me saying that they overcharged me and can I please come back to get my money. I went back AND THEY ENDED UP CHARGING ME ALMOST $800 INSTEAD. THIS PLACE IS SCAM! THE MANAGER IS A SCAMMER!!! DO NOT GET SCAMMED LIKE ME!!</Review>

<text>First time at this location. Needed a tire repair. No one acknowledged me while standing at counter. There were 2 employees inside. After I spoke up and asked if I needed an appointment,  I was told if I didn't mind waiting. This was after several minutes had passed. I was  only one at counter.  Never go in there again!</text>< Pics>

1st time at this place. I made an appointment online for 1:30 p.m.. I showed up at 1:15 p.m. I was told that they would not get to my car for a couple hours. It's been 3 hours and they just brought my car back. The man behind the desk when I checked in was very very rude. I would not recommend coming here to anyone. Their customer service is terrible and their prices are bad too. I only came here because they were open on a Sunday and I needed an oil change last minute. Awful place.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I dropped off my car for an oil change on a Sunday afternoon after I was told over the phone my car would be ready by the time they closed.  There is no waiting room due to COVID-19 so I walked home.  I got a call at 5pm the same day from the shop telling me my car was ready for pick up.  I told the mechanic I was going over to get my car.  I walked 2 miles back to the shop.  When I arrived I discovered they had closed at 5pm (Despite their Google page stating they close at 6pm Sundays).  I had to get a Lyft back home.

The next day I went back to Firestone to pick up my car.  I spoke with someone who turned out to be the store manager John.  I told him what happened.  He apologized and waived the entire oil change cost for the inconvenience.  Thanks John for turning my frown upside down.<//text>< pics>

I dropped off a Quad Cab Ram 2500 standard bed truck (stock rims & tires) for a front end alignment.  About three hours later they called and said the truck was too big for them to work on.  This couldn't have been the first full-size truck they have ever had in the shop.  They didn't know when I dropped it off they couldn't do it?  So.... I waste time dropping it off and arranging a ride ( both ways) and they say, "Well, we called you as soon as we figured out it was too big."
Make your own decisions... However, if they don't even know what their shop can handle; I'm not going to trust them with my vehicle.< /text>

<review>Please stay away from this shop!!!  I went to Firestone for an alignment.  They are the only company that offers a lifetime warranty for alignments that I am aware of.  I thought that sense I will be keeping my Nissan Pathfinder for a long time, this sounded like a great deal.  I recently had some suspension work done on my Nissan Pathfinder and needed to get the tires aligned again.  First time I went in for the alignment, everything looked good but in about 12 hours my tires were so crooked!  Went back in again and asked them to do it again.  They did and again the alignment lasted about 12 hours.  This time, my tires went out so bad lights on my dash started going off.  Once again, back to the shop for another alignment.  I asked them how tight they were making the camber bolts because that is what was causing my tires to go out of alignment.  They only told me that they do it to spec.  Once again, they realigned the tires but after 12 hours everything was back to a horrible condition.  After 3 times going in and no luck in properly doing an alignment they told me they think some bushing in my suspension was broken and that was causing the problem.  They said the bolts are not moving but the bushing are so bad that they need to be replaced.  I didn't believe that for one second because I just did some suspension work done on the car and many parts are brand new.  I also noticed that in the small time I drove around within the 3 alignments and my tires being so far out of alignment my back two, almost new tires, have significant bad tire wear from the inside to the outside.  They messed up my rear tires!!!  I did get a refund of the life time alignment back but I still have messed up tires.  I went over to America Tire Company right down the street and they told me they have never seen such a horrible alignment job.  All the bolts that deal with alignment(the ones that Firestone touched) were loose and only hand tight.  That was why they went out of alignment.  I feel Firestone knew they messed up and tried covering it by telling me it was a bushing!  After America Tire Company did it right my Pathfinder feels amazing and has stayed in alignment< /review>< pictures>

<text>Edit: Grant and the manager Andrew are amazing, they promptly fixed this issue.  Both of them deserve recognition for their awesome customer service.

Normally had good experiences here and good service so I go here for tire issues...  I went here in December for a nail in the tire fix.

Fast forward two months to today, I find when I went to the Infiniti dealership they mounted the tire on backwards and caused the tread to wear incorrectly on all the tires because it was pulling, now I'm going to need to replace all 4 tires!

The pulling when driving was not noticable when driving because the car has self driving feature to keep the car in the lane.<//text><UserId.>113304394610955656134</UserId.><name>Brandon Murdock< /name><time>1551052743283< /time><rate>5< /rate>< Gmap_id>

Came in for a flat tire repair, had a bolt right in the middle of my tire. They took a look to make sure it is repairable and plugged/patched the tire within 20 mins. Cost was $19.99 plus tax. Call them verify price as that could change.<//Text>

A few days ago I went to this Firestone location to have a screw removed from my tire and have the hole patched. The shop was incredibly busy that day. The manager working up front stopped what he was doing, walked outside with me and immediately told me what the problem was. A few hours later the job was finished, as he even stayed late to finish up the remaining vehicles from his busy day. I highly reccommend this shop, best customer service I have ever had with a mechanic!<//text>

I have been having my cars serviced or repaired at the La Habra store for well over 20 years when I lived in La Mirada. The Service Agents have been outstanding in understanding my needs and explaining problems they have found. Since leaving the state and traveling back from Washington before going back, I always go the La Habra store for servicing prior to my return. I've traveled as far as Victorville to have it serviced even though there is a Firestone dealer there. That's how much I trust this store. I truly recommend this store to everyone.<//text>

The best and most trusted mechanic ever! It's good to have one that you can go to for reasonable prices and where the mechanic or dealer doesn't try to sell you $600 performance tires for a small cheapo Honda Fit.  I still cry over that one.  There are great and honest and I would recommend him any day.<//review>

This place is not organized. very unsanitary and smells like feces literally. they are not a team and are selfish and untrustworthy. CROOKS. triple the cost of normal shop. horrible manager, John who breaks tire sensors. but great mechanics and btw.... they dont care what oil goes in your car. proceed with caution.<//Review>

<Review>Brought my vehicle in really late in the afternoon / early evening... they started work on my car near closing time. They found an unexpected (preexisting) problem. They then searched for a supplier of my defective (dealer broken) part. They drove, after their closing hours, to get the part I required. They finished work properly and did not even charge me for getting the (dealer) broken part. I am well pleased with them. I am also done with my dealer where I purchased my car. Firestone will get all my future business. They are good at what they do, go the extra mile for you and they are also very courteous!<//Review><user_name>Jon Ament</user_name>< Pics>

Terrible terrible terrible.   I had a blow tire and was towed there. I asked for the cheapest tire for my car, the rep told me the cheapest one they have is $200+ .  Later on I found out on their website there are serverl $69-70 tires of my tire size that they have in stock.  The rep was super rude really bad attitude, keep using abusive language, keeps telling me don't be cheap while lying to me about the tire options.  Wouldn't let me see the computer before I pay. Later I found out there's a hidden charge I didn't asked for, which is another $21 for the "road hazard".   So $200+ for a tire I didn't want. If he was honest and gave me the $70, I would have replaced all 4 tires.  Just a terrible and extremely dishonest business.   Please don't go there.</text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Called La Habra to life time alignment and wheel balancing done. We had bought our tires with them.
This hapoened last weekend.
Store Manager John signed us up when we made a 9am appointment last Saturday.
After he printed the paper work the Stire Manager John repeated
"Alignment  and oil change'  then I told him, didn't request a oil change.
He kept on arguing this what I have on the system.
We only needed to use our lifetime alignment and lifetime wheel balancing.
The person who took the called logged some thing else in the system we cannot see because we called and made appointment.
But this dummy Store Manager JOHN kept on arguing with us. OMG!!!!!
He got angry, he said system shows you all requested oil Change.
We didn't.
You should see store Manager John's attitude change by looking at his body language.
After he printed the paper work for to be signed. He scribbled the paper with anger and pen stopped working and he threw the pen with anger to the trash bin.
We made appointment at 9 am. We asked when the car will be ready.
He said around 11.30am. And Store Manager John said "we will call you".
We walked outside and I asked my Daughter " did you witnessed what I saw" she said " she saw the same disgusting attitude from the Store Manage John"
11.30am came no one called.
FABULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE.
We were there around Noon to pick up the car.
PLEASE DON'T GO TO THIS FIRESTONE JOINT IN LA HABRA
This is not the first rodeo we had with this Store Manager John.
Even I told the Area Manager but he didn't want to hear prior experiences we had with this Store Manager John.
They used inferior parts on my wife's car when asked they said OEM but it was not the OEM parts.
When example they used inferior oil filter. Inside the filter the paper disintegrated and paper got stuck in the engine.
They didn't use OEM parts.
Car had major problems we had redo what Firestone La Habra did.
The same store manger John.
We DON'T DO OIL CHANGES ANYMORE FROM THIS STORE.
Last year when our life time alignment was the car was parked in a red zone over the curb touching the bottom of the car.
This car is a a low profile car.
The Store Manager John's reply there is no danages.
He didn't want to say simple sorry word.
I made official compliant to Firestone.
I called the Area Manager few days ago with great difficulty.
Talking to him, I understood that he doesn't want to resolve the matter.
He offered us "Free oil change" I told him I am not looking for that.
Then he told me that I should take my cars to Brea store.
Area Manager is Rafeal.
This shows that upper Management to the bottom they don't care for you as a customer, but only cares $$$$$.
I read many reviews about this Store Manager John's attitude.
Wonder why Area Manager and Firestone doesn't do anything about this Store Manager John.
PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS STORE MANAGER AND THIS STORE.
I will let BBB and take other action to let people know what a horrible store and a store Manager John is.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Nice, clean, large, long wait time.  1 mechanic is amazing and informative, 1 mechanic is lazy and just wants you out.  I have lifetime alignment, went to another firestone location and wasn't sure if they even did it.  Went to this one, they definitely did it.< /Review>

I told them we really needed some help, I mean you could hear the air coming out of the tire stem!
We can't believe what we heard and stood there for a second, then she repeat again, SORRY WE JUST CAN'T HELP YOU!

BTW, we fix the tire in the other store, and it only took 10 minutes to do the job.</review>< Rate>

<user_id>102008080017972334695<//user_id><Review>I ordered a tire on 20 jun and was told it would be here by 21 jun and that I could come in the morning to replace it. I came in the evening around 4pm and the tire was still not delivered. The associate frantically called other shops and told me to wait 45 min while it is in transit. A little irritating considering I ORDERED the tire but it's ok. Turns out, 1 HOUR later, they delivered the wrong tire and I would have to come the next day.

I understand mistakes happen but this is ridiculous. I not only have to drive from my home but also wait for a long period of time.

They told me 'mistakes happen' I to try and justify the situation and this mistake just lost you a loyal paying customer.< /Review></record>

I had a tire that was going flat. I could not get the tire off due to the previous tire shop that put it on. It was around 4:30pm on a Sunday and most tire places were shutting down or cutting off service. Firestone was booked like all the rest but told me to bring it in and they would get it in. They came through, I had to buy new lug nuts because they were destroyed in the process of taking them off. However it could have been much much worse. They handled this efficiently and got me on the road again. Much gratitude to you guys!<//review>

<review>Overpriced!! I don't recommend it! I had all my brakes pads and rotors replaced for my 2007 Nissan Quest for almost $1,000!! and when I called a couple of mechanics after that they said they take only $800! they recommended to replace my spark plugs in the future for $545, but thank God that I didn't do them! I did them at Midas for $319!! and when I called the other two mechanics, they gave me the same range between $310 and $320!<//review><date>1462568877114</date><user_id>104531920733535791318</user_id><Rate>1<//Rate>< gmap_id>

Even in the midst of this time of social distancing Isaac helped us from beginning to end. Looking up and locating the blinker light we needed and even offered to install it for us — which he gladly did. He didn't even mind me trying to help a little bit. He was super nice and supportive, thanks Isaac!</Text>

< Review>
It's an auto parts store that has all the stuff you'd expect a good auto parts store to have. It doesn't have a bathroom. The parking lot is accessible and free. The front door entrance is accessible but a bit hard to open.

The day we went, which was a holiday the supplies were a bit depleted.

If you're looking for auto parts or supplies to keep your car up this is a good place to shop.< /Review>

Have everything auto related you would expect. Nothing special though.  Parking lot a bit small. Employees polite and respectful, somewhat knowledgeable enough to help with most things. Pretty clean shop, parking lot has garbage all over ground though,  not prettiest store I've been to.<//text>

I have never been more blown away by the lack of knowledge or service. I go here for cheap parts. Forget any kind of knowledge or advice.

God I wish I could remember the one guy who actually knew what he was talking about. Everyone else there just gives you a blank look when you ask for anything more technical than a windshield wiper blade. Fricking hopeless service. I've been told to wait for half an hour TWICE now becuase some dude was out in the parking lot changing a battery. WHY!? is this place still in buisness?? Step up your game, come on.< /Text>

Arrive early for close and in-front parking spots or else have to park farther in the back of building.
Today, 22-Oct-2019, I arrived at 6:15am and I'm the first and also the first in-line too.
Door opened at 8am as promised.
Got my initial form and filled it out.
They just waited 5 minutes more for our fifth early guests to completed our form then called us up in a group of 5 at a time.
Then we were called up individually by our numbers and this time, they verify our appointment letter and date-stamp it.
We then are sent to another final lobby room to sit and wait for our picture and "index & middle finger" prints.
Done!
Filled out my little yellow customer service survey, dropped it into one of the 3 boxes, and then EXIT at the double-door just left of the table where those 3 boxes were.
Walked over to my car, parked facing Magnolia Ave, sat in the driver's seat, started the engine, looked at the clock on my dashboard, it's 8:15am 🤗🤗🤗
So again, if you wish for speedy services here like how I experienced it, ARRIVE early 😋😉😎
Peace, and I'm out...until 10-years later 😎😎😎<//review>

It was fast. It's in a shopping center which I thought was kind of weird but ok, that's where we had to go.... Not a whole lot of parking. Just go in and get it done.</review>

We stopped here on the way to the sunset cliffs to watch the sunset and picnic with pizza I would definitely recommend it!! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the pizza looked much better than it tasted. It was pretty meh, we did get the veggie so maybe the meat options are better! Overall I had a good experience here< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I might be biased but the pizza here reminds me of local pizza places growing up.

Pizza toppings are very generous! You get a lot of cheese, the sauce is slightly sweet & the crust isn't too thin or thick.

Also got the spaghetti here - could easily feed two people. Lots of sauce & comes with garlic bread. You can skip the side salad though... it's just iceberg lettuce with a couple of tomatoes.

Tip: the wait is about 15 minutes & there is no seat so call ahead :)</text>

The pizza was good, it was loaded with toppings (the mushrooms were so fresh) and it came with a side of Parmesan and red peppers.  Can’t beat that bargain.  I want to try their Philly next time.</Review>< pics>

The price for the food can't be beat. However, we thought that the pizza sauce was very sweet and the cheese was low grade. Definitely a gut bomb. The service was nice and fast. Make sure to check out the specials.<//text>

I love the pizza here but poor customer  service! I work 4 miles away and they wont deliver!! What is up with that? I'm very unhappy with the way the guy on the phone handled himself as well when I tried to explain I'm not as far as he was thinking he came back rude with well we dont reliever there and hung up. Makes me not even want to eat here anymore after that!</Text>

Great 'ZA! We always order the Pep/Mush w/extra sauce and crispy, and it's so good! I love the excellent service and location is very close to home and the beach.  Couldn't ask for anything more from a local pizzeria that is consistent with their awesome pies.  Reminds me of Chicago (WE HAVE THIN CRUST - (way before stuffed) FOLKS!)  & certain NYC Zas.  We love the fresh ingredients, and friendly service- Thanks, Rosaria's!</text>

<review>Dr. Godes' practice has helped me seamlessly transition from a conventional dentistry model to an approach that is more holistic and better for the long-term health of my mouth and body. The diagnostics in her office are extremely detailed. I had the mercury removed with no trouble, and she replaced two crowns (same day permanent fitting!) which resulted in an immediate improvement in my bite alignment and periodontal condition. Her staff is very caring and thorough. My dental hygienist has helped me progress my home care routine so I can more proactively manage my specific issues between visits. I highly recommend Dr. Godes' dental practice, especially if you are curious about making the change to holistic dentistry!<//review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Worst dentist in San Diego I’ve encountered thus far.

I went here to redo some old dental work just out of due diligence- I wanted my health to be at its best.

After the first round of work was done- the crown had slipped and about 1/4 of my original tooth was showing.

The dentist redid this crown for me when I went in the next day.

Keep in mind that every time dental work is done- there is trauma and inflammation that occurs to the mouth, so when looking out for your health, you want to make sure to use a lower powered drill (if you’re truly going holistic) and as little as possible.

I then went on to have about $5000 of dental work done since we were redoing a lot of past work.

I actually have had dental malpractice done when I was 16 years old (to my whole family), so for me to trust a new dentist was truly a leap of faith for me. But in this case- I trusted the wrong people.

As the dentist drilled my bottom molars, I was in absolute pain because I was not numbed properly. I guess I’m a little harder to numb than the average person- but that is no excuse to keep drilling and tell the patient to deal with the pain. It was truly a nightmare. I tried to just keep a good attitude about it because I was just grateful my teeth were all being taken care of (I thought).

Once this work was completed I started feeling pain in my bottom two molars. I called the dentist and they said it was a bite adjustment that needed to be done.

I went in about 5 times for a bite adjustment - this is unheard of to me- I have never had to come back to be adjusted after dental work was done, but I remained patient and went in for the 5 times.

The pain remained in my mouth at this point. I could barely eat anything. Even a salad- I had to eat it with my front teeth.

I came back in and sat in the chair only for the dental assistant to come up to me and ask to do another set of X-rays. This is when I started crying on the chair. I had been so patient, and hadn’t been in pain before this dentist, I wanted to go the holistic route- but I had already had extra drilling that shouldn’t have needed to be done, and now I was being pushed to take MORE X-rays, more radiation. If this place was truly holistic, they would avoid unnecessary radiation and drilling at all costs.

Keep in mind that it takes an hour of driving each time I go to the dentist and this is my 6th time coming in.

The assistant then tells me that they have no time to see me and to go make an appointment and come back.

So I stay patient. I go home and I come back.

This time when I come back, the dentist smoothed out two rough spots that were left behind on some work, and redid one of the molars. I was encouraged not to fix the other molar because it was probably just a bite problem. So they just tried to fix the bite.

Long story short I came into this dentist 10+ times, had the two molars redone, along with another filling, and a crown- wow! That’s a lot of work to be redone.

The crown that was redone is extremely sensitive to cold now. And the bottom right molar is still in a lot of pain despite being redone. The dentist had reached out to me and said maybe it’s not a dental problem maybe it’s something else - shouldn’t this have been addressed in the office? Maybe a referral or recommendation instead of drilling when there’s a different problem?

I’m extremely disappointed in the quality of work in this office. To top it off, I would like to go to another dentist to look at my teeth and fix the pain but this office won’t refund me for the faulty work done (they refunded $250 out of $5000, which is a complete joke). There seems to be a thing about money here. They’ll redo teeth a million times but they won’t give your money back.

To top it off, the owner isn’t able to take any verbal responsibility, which is truly sad. But I’m not writing for an apology, although of course that would be appreciated. I am writing to warn the public. I trusted this dentist vulnerably with my health and I walked out of this office crying many, MANY times. Stay away.</review>< Pictures>

<text>I've gone to see 7 dentists in San Diego County between myself and for my kids over the years.  I've been very happy with Dr. Stacy Goddess and Dr. Andrea Blum.  They have a holistic approach and are great with my young boys.  Everyone in the office is very nice and I appreciate their support in helping my youngest with his dental issues and me with my concerns over it.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>So blessed to have found Dr. Blum!  During my last (long) visit, the office staff,along w/their exceptional knowledge, created a very comfy environment for me, which included a warm blanket and a movie! Hands down the BEST dental experience I have had - to date!  It's obvious this practice strives for the comfort & satisfaction of their patients as their #1 priority!  Talking the talk AND walking the walk!<//Review><GmapID>0x80dc09331e6e0f8d:0x77f63b8589ae62be< /GmapID><user_id>107680122382799173502</user_id></record></dataset><record>
<user_name>Ninette Sanders<//user_name><text>I reached out to Dr. Godes in Mid August out of sheer desperation. I was not a patient of hers, but I had recently had my braces removed by my orthodontist and had been through two different sets of retainers provided by him.  Neither set worked for me as my body had bad reactions to certain materials in them.  My orthodontist was unwilling to look at my listing of materials that are suitable for my body (I tried to be proactive and have him look at the listing before my braces were removed to no avail).  Long story short, my case is a very difficult one and Dr. Godes and staff went above and beyond to help me.  It did take quite a bit of research, but three weeks and three days after my initial contact I received a pair of amazing retainers in a material my body can handle.  I have had my retainers for two days now and from the first night I have been sleeping so much better than I have in years!  I have dealt with several different people at Dr. Godes office and they have all been so wonderful, kind and patient when dealing with me.
My deepest gratitude to all who worked on my case and helped find a solution for me!  I look forward to continuing all my dental needs with Dr. Godes!<//text><time>1536860130691< /time><gmap_id>0x80dc09331e6e0f8d:0x77f63b8589ae62be</gmap_id>< userid>

The best experience I've had yet! The entire staff was very friendly and made me feel incredibly comfortable throughout the duration of my visit. Everything is explained in detail (step by step if need be) so that the patient stays well-informed, which helped ease my nerves. Above all I appreciate the holistic base of Dr.Godes practice. This is a definite "YES" recommendation. I can't wait to complete my perfect smile will the Dr. Godes!<//Review>

Absolutely wonderful! From the moment I walked in as a new patient with a broken tooth. The service was very fast and everyone there was very caring and professional. The environment is an amazing mix of natural medicine and super high-tech. I had a full set of X-rays, exam and consultation, 3D scan of my broken tooth after they cleaned it up and a new crown made in house with their CNC milling machine and put in within 4 hours. The new Crown fit perfect with very minimal bite adjustment and healed up incredibly fast. Could barely feel it the next day. Very highly recommend this Clinic!</text>

Amazing Amazing Amazing!!! Never, have I EVER been to a dentist office with everyone so incredibly top notch!!! Dr. Godes is thee best. You will know immediately that you are in the right hands. Her entire practice/staff is so personable and adheres to the highest of standards. I couldn't be happier, as it has taken me a long time to FINALLY land where I know my dental needs can be treated by the best in the industry.< /Review>

Awesome experience.  I had several old fillings removed and replaced with non-toxic material. The whole process took about 45 minutes and Dr. Goddess and the team were fantastic. Highly highly recommend this dental office for cleanings and any dental work that might scare you or make you uncomfortable. Happy people happy clients happy customer.<//review>

<Text>Beautiful and professional atmosphere. Sneha, my dental hygienist, is so thorough in her cleaning and always a joy to see. I always leave with my teeth feeling amazing, and so well informed of the best steps to take to care for my  dental health. Both she and Dr. Godes, as well as the entire staff, are wonderful people and up to date in the latest in holistic dentistry. I've had one filling replaced, and Dr. Godes and her assistant that day were amazing in helping me to feel relaxed and well taken care of.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dc09331e6e0f8d:0x77f63b8589ae62be< /gmap_id></record>

The Office was easy to find and very comfortable, and every staff member was so attentive and patient with me answering all my questions and addressing my concerns and special needs.  It is so nice to feel cared for, and to find a Dentist who goes out of their way to give you the best help possible.  I feel very relieved and confident that I am in very good hands.<//text>< date>

She is so knowledgeable about the holistic alternatives to standard dentistry, I feel very safe and comfortable in her hands.  I have always had such pleasant experiences when I go for my annual cleanings and check ups and the office is absolutely beautiful and  spa like . The entire staff are always so pleasant and respectful and this last visit did not disappoint.<//text><Time>1487433654534< /Time>< Pictures>

From the moment I entered the waiting room and saw the library of books Dr. Godes has, I knew I was in good hands. The staff was very friendly and supportive of my many special needs with Lymes disease and FQ toxicity. Dr. Godes was amazing and  very knowledgeable  of my  health concerns  and  was very kind and  respectful.   I have been searching years for a good biological dentist like this, so happy to have found her!<//Text>

<Text>I saw Dr. Blum for a number of different problems with my teeth. She was able to clearly explain why she recommended certain procedures, as well as how they were going to proceed. I appreciated her willingness to spend extra time with me to make sure all my questions were answered. She was not pushy and did not suggest anything that seemed unnecessary. Her staff was friendly and professional. I sought out Dr. Blum initially for mercury filling replacement, and felt that her holistic approach was very effective.< /Text></record>

<Text>Nice folks...I didn't give 5 stars because there wasn't, for my comfort in an first time appt., enough initial explanation of what they were exploring and concerned about in addition to the problem I was consulting them for.
And then, when I received a treatment plan with fees, etc this initial issue was not included at all until I brought it to their attention.
And, I found everyone to be very responsive once I slowed things down a bit and asked my questions....<//Text>< pics>

I was a patient of  Dr. Blum for a few years and extremely satisfied with my dental care - then I had to leave because of my job change and lack of dental coverage. Two years later I got a new job and thankfully I have coverage again with Dr. Blum! So glad to be back with Dr. Blum, a dedicated dentist (and staff) that cares about you and your teeth!</text>

If i could give no stars i would. This is one of thee worst dentists you could ever encounter,  and i mean that very seriously, she should come with a warning sign "proceed with caution and at your own peril and risk" . I  would not recommend Dr Stacy Godes, she is just simply not competent, i had work done on two teeth with her and have had terrible problems post it, i had no pain before i went to her and an abundance since she performed her handiwork. I have had to go to specialists to figure out what the hell she did that is causing me so much pain and basically it boils down to she screwed up and did not know what she was doing, she screwed up an inclusion on a crown in an area that she should not have even put a crown in, but it's a money racket and i would seriously caution anyone looking for a dentist to find another and i would NOT recommend her. If you are looking for a great, actually fantastic dentist, Dr. Steven Jaska is exemplary.  He's amazing actually; he was delegated with the dubious undertaking of correcting Dr Godes incompetent and negligent work.  I like Dr. Blum, whom is in the same office as Dr. Godes, but she is basically semi-retired, and the staff put you with this Dr. Godes whom is totally incompetent. I was going to report her to the dental board,  that is how incompetent and negligent  i thought she was and is, but my new dentist ( Dr. Jaska)  is trying to undo her incompetence and he is making headway thus i did not report  her as i had intended to do so. She and her assistant is rude and only thought it in their best interest to address the screw-up, when they knew,  i not only could,  but would sue them,  and report their behavior to the dental board, but my guess would be if i was not an attorney and they were not apprised of their impending fate, they would have been dismissive and in fact would have referred you out to a specialist of their recommendation to ensure their negligent (you know what) was covered. I was not entertaining their nonsense much less their insipid CYA referrals to cover for her very apparent negligent work. There are a lot of good dentists in the area and she is not amongst them. In fact I would say and definitively she is thee worst dentist I have ever had the misfortune to have been unknowingly placed in her negligent and incompetent care.<//Text>

For at least the past 15 years, if not longer, I have had all of my dental needs addressed with SO much care, SO much concern,  great professionalism, with a very personal, dedicated, warm manner, by Dr. Andrea Blum. I cannot laud her sufficiently enough for all she has so generously done for me over the years, yet I can state that, now that I live in North Carolina, I wait to see only her  for my dental concerns!< /text>

Church packed with people who want to hear a "good luck" message from a pastor who can't decide if he's an entertainer or a preacher.
Come dressed in your "raggedy" old clothes and be comfortable...is their code.
Best marketing approach for a successful business I've seen in a long time. It obviously works...like I said, it's packed!
I don't feel much "God-liness" going on here however.<//Text>

I attended here for a couple years when I lived in Riverside. Amazing church with amazing people! Definitely leans toward a younger audience more than old school church and I find no problem with it. God's word is still being shared and people are being reached!< /Review>

Wonderful church home with a pastor that connects with the congregation in so many ways. Great small groups that cover a variety of interest and topics. The church is passionate about Jesus.< /review>

I visited this church on Mother's Day 2019. My impression of it was it's a nice church with several different accommodations, the pastor has a good sense of humor, and their mother's day booths & giveaways were very nice!< /Review>

The view is nice however,  the floor was super dirty, tables were not clean either. The service was just mediocre though the food was ready quickly. My husband said the burger tasted a bit funny, tacos were good, a friend said the tuna melt was yummy.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Really great hospitality over the phone, quick room service (less than 15 mins), fresh food and fruit with our breakfast, and wonderful coffee! Definitely made our trip to the Lakehouse Hotel even better.</text>

<text>I've been here a few times now, the reuben sandwich is fantastic, the shrimp tacos are good and beers flow on tap. The outdoor patio overlooks the driving range and it really makes for a calm, quiet lunch spot. The parking is at the golf clubhouse...give it a shot!< /text></record>

< Review>
I haven't been there for a long time.  I was pleasantly surprised
It's very clean and Martin the bartender/server was knowledgeable and friendly. I had the Sunday special which is fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and broccoli. It was good.  A person at my table was happy with the fish and chips.  The other person at my table had the burger and fries.  Got a definite thumbs up on that. They have a special every night except for Friday when they have music. The prices are good.   My chicken dinner was only $12.99.  On Saturday they have prime rib for $13.99.  You can sit inside or outside and watch the golfers.  There are fire pits out there so I definitely want to give that a try.  They also have breakfast all day.  Nice place to bring visitors or just go to a pleasant, quiet place to dine.  Give it a try.< /Review>

<text>The grill is a nice place to eat if outdoors and nice weather. Inside is small and not very cozy and we miss a place that was within our budget before the decoy and dockside were built. Our friends and family can't afford dinner out at decoy and not enough room at dockside. So we go elsewhere now. The grill is worth going if weather is good so you can sit outside.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>We love this place and frequent it often. The service from Jake, Hailey, Cierra, Shari and Dean and Martin is always outstanding...they always  make us feel welcome! We are very puzzled as to why Jake is not the manager, as he, unlike Frank the current manager, is always here and always ensuring the utmost in customer service and the smooth running of the restaurant.<//Review>< date>

Long large dining room has a perfect view of the first hole tee, tables and booths inside with patio tables outside.  Feels old school, Easter brunch was only fair, some choices no longer available.  Staff was nice but inexperienced.  We were seated 30 minutes after our "Open Table" reservation time.   My three stars suggests you consider other options.<//review>

<Review>Terrific food, great deals daily, right on beautiful St. Mark golf course. We had lunch, one of the best Reuben sandwiches I've had, and a dinner to remember, a Pasta Bar, all you can eat, that was made to order using only fresh ingredients. Oh if only we lived closer, we stayed at the nearby Lakehouse Hotel. Martin and the rest of the staff showed genuine hospitality. Don't forget to visit the Golf Shop, resident Professional Kevin Urick was extremely kind and again I tell you, a genuine guy who met us as we came off the course, as night had also reached us, and was kind enough with his time to talk with us and find out if we needed anything at all. Well that's why we stayed and discovered the Pasta Bar. I could go on, but I'll just say, come on by. Bye for now!< /Review>< Rating>

How do you feel when you walk into a restaurant attached to the golf course, early morning & encounter a stiff talking hostess with no smile.
Worst experience ever.. She took forever to bring us even the menu &  make sure we had a enough silver. The food took forever to arrive.
The only saving grace was the view of the golf course.</Text>

<Text>The food was great. Clean and clean, I got the vegetarian platter,  I will admit the prices are steep and I can't compare it to other Mediterranean cuisine since I've only really had this place so from that aspect I can only give my opinion. I also have ordered the meals through phone and picked up so I can't say it took long. Overall the food and quality were great but I'll definitely be trying other joints to make better judgment on taste and price.<//Text></record>

UGH!!! It never fails! Each and every OTHER time I come into this Tofa’s location, there is a problem with my food. For the price and the location this is UNACCEPTABLE! Normally when I come I order babba ganoush, hummus, or for the first time today, the lentil soup. Sounds simple right? Today my lentil soup was served with a healthy serving of brown curly hair and the babba ganoush was sour! I almost wonder if I’m being “pranked” when I come here because this happens ALL TOO OFTEN with my orders! You would think that I would have stopped doing business with them but because I literally live 4 minutes up the street and LOVE Mediterranean food, I put aside my differences and return. However this is the last time this location will earn my business! I am emphatically disgusted and horrified. Because these are franchised locations, of course there is no manager on site or access to a corporate number. Today I was given information for someone named Laila and forwarded her the picture of my soup . Now it’s beginning to make total sense why, despite the number of growing restaurants near this establishment, that it is ALWAYS seemingly empty! Think twice before you pay the price or decide to order hairball stew from this location. YUCK and YIKES!!!<//text>

Clean establishment, good customer service. The food is made to order thus it is a bit slower than many restaurants of the same vain. The plate I ordered was substantial with a pita and huge side of hummus. Hummus was tasty, garlic sauce was a bit bland, salad and tabouleh were decent but my falafel was a little overcooked.< /Review>

The wait time was about 40minutes for a family of 5. I ordered 3 kids Chicken Shwarma bowls and 2 Chicken Shwarma with Fatoush Salad. About 30 minutes waiting, the server came up and said that they were closing in 10 minutes so she arranged for everything to be placed in to go containers, no problem with that. The food arrived 9 minutes later minus 1 chicken with salad that came 8 minutes after that. The most upsetting part about the meal was the kids Chicken Shwarma, I paid $7 a piece for a handful of cooked rice with 1/4 piece of chicken. Essentially $21 for 1 chicken breast and 2 1/2 cups of rice and 3 Capri Suns. This was my second visit to this location, the first being somewhat pleasant but I will not be returning due to this experience.</Text>

First visit was fine. Ordered the gyro and enjoyed it with no issues. Second visit was a bit more frustrating. Ordered chicken shawarma and sat down to wait. Staff dropped it off to the adjacent table who ordered after me even after making an attempt to let them know they are dropping my plate off to the wrong table. I let the staff know at the front that I believe they made a mistake, no big deal.

Front staff says "Oh no worries there is another one coming up." Cool, guess I'll wait a little longer. Sit back down and a few minutes later staff is bringing more food to the table next to me, the same one that ordered after me. Keep in mind they are a larger party. I'm just here on my lunch break trying to eat and get back to work. Feels bad to see a large party get served before a single order especially since they came in after I did.

This table looks at the food they're brought and say "Hey, I ordered the kebab not the shawarma." Hmm... I'm still patiently waiting, hoping they bring me my food soon. Staff starts heading my way, drops off chicken kebab, and says "Hey you were right, I accidentally gave your food to the other table." This is the part that kind of turned the whole thing sour, the gentlemen helping me turns around to walk back to the counter after acknowledging he gave my order away and then dropping off the other tables order in front of me. I had to stop him and ask if I could get the order I wanted.

Best part here, after waiting even longer, they bring my order out... to the other table.

Food is great, service seems...inconsistent. I'd probably go back, but not for a while. Maybe the staff needs some more training or experience to give customers a more consistent experience.<//text>

Delicious but they dime you on the little things like tziki sauce and charge 3.50 for a tiny Hummus</text>

<rating>5</rating><text>I ordered online with my account. They make it easy to find popular choices from their menu or to customize and create your own pizza the way you want. It is ready quickly and then put into a large holding oven that is secured by a PIN, which they send you your code so you can walk into the store and get your order. I got a thin crust with the toppings I wanted, a 6 piece of buffalo wings, and an order of crazy bread. Everything was good and hot. The prices are reasonable. Thanks Little Caesars! 😃< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJUz3i5-t3SFHSW5j2JRoCw3oBwaLHf0eAVyA-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuAoxLlvg_GYZ0vWP7AfiSPacYY2afFdWrYQiB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

Little ceasar pizza one of the better fast food pizza parlors. I prefer it over domino's or pizza hut because the dough tastes better. I am also old school all I want is cheese and theirs is not greasy. Also their square pie (deep dish) reminds me of Sicilian style from back on the east coast. This site does have the pizza portal so your pie stay hot till you pick it up. I only gave 3 stars because of location especially at night it is not the best place to be. Otherwise I would give it  5 stars for the food is good, fast service and the staff friendly.</review>

Just wish they had a door that opened automatically. Either u open it urself and tip ur pizza over or someone opens it for u which not many do. And area looks dirty, many hobos standing around bugging people for money. I can only imagine how dirty the inside must be.</Review>

They have poor health standards during the quarantine. There is a sign in their lobby that says something like, "Only three people can be in the lobby at a time." There were more than three people in the lobby most of the time while I was outside their building, waiting for my turn to step inside. Even after I asked an employee if it is allowed for more than 3 people to be in the lobby, they said no, and continued to let more than 3 people in the lobby. They also have a sign that says something like, "No mask, no service." They served people without masks on. One employee also did not wear their mask over their nose, and that is not the correct way to wear the mask. This place is dangerous.</review>

**Quick note for Management** Every employee I have encountered here has been extremely polite and helpful. I wanted to specifically point out the fact that the staff always appears in control, they seem to communicate very well with one another and each member is doing SOMEthing .. meaning no one is just standing around... a MILLION KUDOS to you guys!<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< user>

I was out the door and in my car pretty quick and to make sure, I double checked my ordered and realized they forgot my wings, I went in with receipt and ready to show them the back of my car where the food was if they needed to verify I indeed did not have them.

I won't complain about the crowd. They make something that can generously be called pizza, and sell it cheap. That means they'll be busy around dinner time. What I will complain about us that my online order placed over two hours ahead was over fifteen minutes late.</Review>

This place is fine. I mean, it's Little Caesars. It's fast-food pizza and if you expect anything more than that then you should rethink your life choices. If you're in a hurry and need pizza fast, this is your place. Their pizza is perfectly fine and tasty. Their non-regular items, like the bacon deep-dish, are actually really good. I wish they would have them year-round.

I just tried their Hawaiian pizza for the first time because usually I just get a hot-n-ready pepperoni, and I really liked that too. I think it actually think it can rival some of the other major chains as well.

Don't be afraid to mix it up sometimes.

The only reason to avoid this particular location would be because it is a transient hub and 9 times out of 10 you're guaranteed to be asked for changed by some dudes just hanging out outside.< /Text>

<review>Horrible costumer service.  11/8/19 around 4:30pm I called to place my order and the way she answer the phone was really unprofessional. “What do you want to order”??? Really! She told me it would take .20 minutes for my food to be ready. I got there and still had to wait more time cause my order wasn’t ready. Food is good it’s just the service they need more training or at least management on site.<//review>< GmapID>

Always decent,  but never a wow.  Good pizza for the price.  Often a wait for anything special including hawaiian.  Always a good fall back pizza place, but never a favorite.  Like that there's garlic butter sauce too.<//Text>

Nothing special here. Strictly average in all aspects. What prevents a higher score is their location. Homeless are EVERYWHERE at this complex. It is not uncommon to watch a drug deal going down outside while you are getting your pizza.  If you have the nerve to order anything except a quick and ready pizza, you may very well find yourself waiting a very long time. A staff here at 10 to give much more priority to the quick and ready pizzas then they do any special orders. I have never had a special order pizza here that I had to wait any less than 45 minutes. It is for these reasons that I can give this place no more than two stars.<//review>

<Review>Does not deviate too much from your standard little Caesar's pizza. This one is cleaner than average and upkeeps the chain's quick service. During busy times parking can be troublesome but manageable. This caveat, however, is made up for by the very friendly staff.< /Review><Response>None</Response></record>

They put me on hold on the phone for 15 minutes and Once I went in and saw it was not packed, is when I had a problem with it. And they still made me wait 15 minutes for my order. Not a good place to call when you want your order ready to pick it up.</review>

I stopped in for the Hot and Ready and got cold and not. The wait was only 5 minutes for the meat lovers equivalent and they threw in a 2 liter for the wait.
It's on State College in a run down strip mall.  It's the fast food equivalent for pizza.

< Review>
It isnt those you choose topping like most family owned shops when you want atrichoke, it isnt the advertised perfection like others offer with cheese stuffed or what not. However bang for the buck is 5 stars to me! Id wait 45 minutes for a delivery from others or 20 minutes wait instore from other places. For the price its good and i would rather pay the same price then have to cook it myself for less taste! Keep rockin it! Marketing is marketing and has nothing to do with the people doing the job! I posted this due to the negatives ive seen. If its that bad then why did you come back? Support to middle man making the stuff we to lazy to make ourselfs! Thank you guys and gals, you the working force to our joy!<//Review>

For once I would like to get a cheese pizza that looks like their picture does instead of one that has half the cheese and crust bubbles all over with no cheese on them. It happens a lot and I get almost every weekend but moving on to a new pizza place, tired of half the cheese and dry crust bubbles every time. I have a pic if you want to see it. Why don't you make them to look like the picture nice and cheesy and no crust bubbles.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>
