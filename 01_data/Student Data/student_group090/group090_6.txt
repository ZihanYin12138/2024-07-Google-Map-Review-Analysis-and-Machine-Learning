Every one was very nice.  Looks like they are working on the drive thru but they made it work. Order was put together fast. Never had the mt dew sweet lightning, i had to go back for a larger cup.<//Review>

<review>They gave me burnt chicken, I know they saw that it was burned and yet they still threw it in my 12 piece bucket. The nerve... I thought that because the kfc was on Rosedale in a nice area that I did not need a receipt. Well, I was wrong!  I'm guessing that most of these Great reviews are from the employees...<//review><gmapID>0x80ea43d937f01831:0xafee6e058dcb8d42</gmapID><Rating>1</Rating>< userid>

< Review>
I’ve only been to this location a couple times and every single time.. my order was totally wrong and it was always the same girl at the window all those times, Not only is she extremely rude but if you just go back looking for your correct order then you’re getting an eye roll and an attitude. None of those times that my order was messed up did she ever apologize or anything! She acted like it was my fault that it was messed up. I tried looking for a name tag but she wasn’t wearing one but she is always wearing a purple T-shirt and she has dark hair. If I were a manager I would never allow someone with an attitude like that to be customer facing.<//Review>

I made a last-minute decision to pull in to get something to eat at KFC and instantly pain looking at the menu I said I wanted to have both types of KFC bowls and the person that took the order was completely people friendly. I went to the window to pay and get my food and wow! What a delicious amount of food for such a little bit of price. If you want a quick delicious hot snack, KFC is definitely the place to go< /review>

It was a very good experience, the line was long but fast, they got all of our food correctly and fast which k appreciate ☺️ They took the necessary safety precautions they wore masks and the pickup was right at the door so you didn't even enter the store. Overall it was an excellent experience 😊< /Text>

This place is good like any other KFC, make sure to ask for ketchup when you order. Like that they know, it's been a few times when there wasn't any ketchup for my fries. Order their crispy chicken instead of the original, just taste better in my opinion.< /review>

I have given this place several chances. Ordered a 3 piece strips with 2 sides and bottled water. Price more than double what was on the menu. I know i ordered 2 different sides and bottled water, but double the 6.99. Then got home and 3 pieces of ?. I was glad when KFC came back to northwest but will not go there again.</Review>

Loved it!!! 100%  so glad they're here on our side of town.   It was wonderful,  even picked up orders for some older family members to drop off curbside.   Everyone was very happy 😊
Thank you!!</review>

<Text>I love KFC but this place is difficult to find because there is no sign along the highway. Only GPS will tell you exactly where it is. The other issue I have is that they offered me a combo meal and I assumed that it included a drink. I was wrong. They also forgot to include the spork with my meal.</Text>< pictures>

Chicken was fresh and moist. Not greasy.  Biscuits were undercooked and doughy.  Coleslaw had NO dressing in it. Dry.  Just the cabbage and onion. I called and let the mgr know so they could make sure product was being sent out correctly.  I friend went there the next day and the coleslaw was the same
Dry with no dressing.   Such a shame.</text>

So far only the drive thru is open and the line moved smoothly. I didn't get the side of mac & cheese I added to my order and couldn't find my receipt to see if I was charged...pretty sure I was. The meal was good but it seemed like the seasonings hadn't been mixed thoroughly and the batter was a bit thick in spots. Not really trying to complain; just want them to do well for all of us out here in Rosedale and Northwest Bako!! Just pay attention to your job and do it right❤️< /review>

Today we ordered the 8 piece meal extra crispy. The chicken was greasy probably due to the oil not to temperature when dropped in. The coleslaw had little to no dressing and the instant mashed potatoes were not completely mixed. The biscuits were so so, couldn't put my finger on what made them different. I know this KFC just recently opened but that shouldn't be an excuse for food that was not to KFC standards. Lots of people have been waiting for KFC to open and this is what we get.</text>

<review>Really good food! Only allowed to do drive thru or order from grubhub, which lets you pick up or deliver. This is most likely due to covid-19. Highly recommend it!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Really good Italian food! Stopped by here for some pasta, we tried pasta with clams. It was amazing. Linguine vongole is my favorite pasta and they did it great. Very flavorful and with fresh clams. Service was great, too.<//Review>

Stopped in for a glass of wine. Bartender recommended the house Cab Sauv. Very easy to drink and delicious. The manager, Karina stopped by to greet my friend and I - very friendly and professional. Awesome vibe and I will have to come back here for food. All the food heading to the tables looked and smelled delicious!</review>

Great service but a non-transparent pricing makes this restaurant a difficult one to recommend. We had a reservation for a large group that required a deposit which was not brought up to us on the restaurant's OpenTable page. When we sat the waiter offered sparkling or still water, not informing us it was $6 a bottle, otherwise we would have specifically asked for tap water. There was also confusion about how the tip would work for our party, as the deposit had said that the gratuity was to be charged to the card on file. The food itself was fine, though the overall experience left much to be desired. With so many other restaurants in the area your money may be better spent elsewhere.</review>

< Review>
Dined at the restaurant for dinner today. We ordered seafood pasta and risotto. Pasta was flavorful and appetizing, but not so true for risotto. But the experience was good until we got the bill. They charged us 18% service charge for the party of 2. When asked for clarification, manager was rude and was saying 18% is normal and expected. Anyone else heard that 18% service charge is NORMAL ??

Note: We verified the bill again, it was service charge and not the surcharge.

Reference for the bill: 03/16/18 - 08:43PM - CHK:41 - Table:63<//Review>

After having lived in Italy for 9 years, this equals some of the best. The most attractive part is the quietness of the accoustics making even a crowded dining room easy to hear your guest. We found the service comfortably slow as the food is cooked to order fresh; especially the seafood. For those who want quick service and no time for intimate conversation, there are many available drive through fast food chains!  I recommend it!</Text>

Poor and combative service. Amazing given the the lack of individuals in the establishment. Rather than making things right the wait staff wanted to argue. Plenty of choices in this area of San Diego.  Choose another restaurant if you want good service.<//text>

The Gluten free options attracted us to this restaurant. American pizza pie and chicken pasta were prepared well and our waiter was very friendly and genuine. Wine selection has a wide variety.</text>

We came early with two kids and 5 adults. As no one was seated they let us pick a table towards the back. They had a kids menu and very acomaditing.  Thomas was a very well trained server. Food was very good. A little pricey but nice size portions.  Was quite enough we could visit and we felt welcome to take our time. Would have given  five stars but the back ground music was top 20 hits MC Hammer really? maybe play Italian or clasical. And Tira sum was shoggy. Do watch bill as they did add 20% tip to bill.< /review>

Great Italian in the Gaslamp :)
We had a wonderful experience at Chianti. The Cioppino was great and the pasta super fresh. Our waiter Jason was very knowledgeable about the wines and the menu and made sure we were well taken care of.< /review>

Went there yesterday.  They totally forgot to put our order in and it took about a half hour to get our food.  Food itself was okay but I've had better italian.  For a Friday night it was a bit dead too (which makes it worse that we waited so long)</review>

Pricier than some other places in the Gaslamp area, but the food is worth it. Great variety and selection on the menu, the food was outstanding. Serious portions, too - you won't leave hungry. The staff were very attentive, and obviously very knowledgeable about the menu offerings. The girlfriend and I both had questions, and our waiter answered with obvious experience and sincerity - no rote-script commentary on the dishes, but honest (and excellent) suggestions. The food wasn't super-quick in coming, but this is obviously a place where you are planning on taking your time, so that wasn't a detractor. If you want a good, quality Italian dining experience down in the Gaslamp, check out Chianti. And be sure to try the tiramisu!<//text><resp>None< /resp></record>

I went here for Halloween a few years back because I had a restaurant certificate. My friend and I did dress up and walked in and we got a few looks but that's why we were in costume!

My friend and I had the cold cuts and mixed cheese board which had every type of italian deli meat you could imagine and delicious cheeses. It was a great way to warm up our stomachs for ravioli and lasagna. My friend had the lobster ravioli but she didn't like it very much and my lasagna was pretty standard. I don't remember too much of either because it seemed good enough to eat but not something I would have paid full price for without the restaurant certificate.

Our waiter was really nice and was also a wine distributor and offered great advice about wines. I had the moscato and it was definitely yummy but I don't think you can ever go wrong with moscato!</Review>

<Text>Although the server forgot our orders and we waited over half hour for an antipasto...their pasta dishes are more than made up for their initial shortcomings. Their daily special linguine alla coda di aragosta (lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp linguine) was superb. Sitting here again for our second meal in less than 3 days.< /Text>< Pics>

The drinks had black stuff in them and the seemingly friendly waiter kept telling us it was "bubbles".  No, it was black dirty stuff.  Don't go here.  They were blaming us for their dirt on the glasses.  No offer to even pay for the drinks.  No thank you.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The lasagna was just cheese. When we told him that, he just said "yes, yes that's so" and did not serve us anymore. Price performance is not right. Go on, do not go in there.

(Original)
Die Lasagne bestand nur aus Käse. Als wir Ihm das mitteilten, sagte er nur "ja ja das ist so" und hat uns nicht mehr bedient. Preisleistung stimmt überhaupt nicht. Weiter gehen,  reingehen lohnt sich nicht.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>Avoid this gas station. Judy specifically at all costs. She's horrible customer service to women but she'll kiss your behind if you're a man. Yeah. She's one of those. I was thinking she'd be nice when I eventually got to the front of the line because she was over the top friendly but apparently she used up her "nice" chips on the men. Desperate old hag.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Great place to stop as right hear the freeway. Great gas prices and fast service. Only one unisex bathroom, so there was a line continuously while we were there.</text>

I hate that they charge that fee that no one else charges for your debit card AND they out a hold on your funds.  They used to be my go-to for the cheaper gas prices, but no longer.  Now they jacked the prices up so I don't even go here for the convenience store.  You lost all my business ARCO.  Great job... lol<//Review>

The car wash usually has a 2 or 3 person line. The people inside the 7-11 are also usually pretty helpful except for this one guy who likes to talk to customers like they're stupid. Overall though, nice place. To recap, if you only need gas, this place is really expensive - go someplace else. If you need both a fill-up and a wash, this is your place.</Text><time>1511400932240<//time><UserId.>104806839100596786306< /UserId.>< Pics>

Well it's a gas station. Could be little cleaner outside and window to view instructions on pump is cloudy and scratched. Makes it hard to read instructions. Car wash is good but blower to dry car not that great. Shell station is combined with a 7/11 store. Can't comment on the store or service I didn't go inside</Text>

<Text>This gas station has a sign showing two different prices, one for cash payment and one for credit payment. I went inside and paid $20, yet they still charged me the credit price, which was a $0.20 difference. Unfortunately, though, I didn't notice what I was paying per gallon until I drove away. It may not seem like a huge thing, but it is to me and shows shady business practices. Not sure I'd stop here for gas again, but if I did, I would make sure they charged me the correct price.</Text><gmapID>0x80c2d13b4f5dadcb:0x4e9c00b817968379</gmapID>< name>

someone wrote a one star review saying they had two prices, one for cash and one for card. so when i got here i wanted to make sure that didn't happen to me. the reviewer was mistaken. The prices are "with carwash" and "without carwash". which is why he was charged the higher price for paying with cash. they do not have a cash price for gas. just clarifying for future readers.</text>

I love that they don't charge extra for using a credit card here, however, there is a reduced price when purchasing gas with a car wash. The only issue I sometimes have here is that it does get crowded and sometimes not all the pumps are in service.</text>

Credit card was skimmed twice when paying at the pump. If you pay inside you have to pay on 2 different machines for fuel and sundries. It's relatively dirty.< /Review>

The pumping station is good, but service at counter is spotty. I've walked out once in a hurry because no one was available for someone already waiting at the counter before I arrived.<//Review>

<Text>Horrible false restrictions. Will not make reasonable accomadations. CDC even says you can make masks out of shirts, towels, anything cloth hand held. And yet you can see workers in the warehouse not wearing masks. And workers behind checkin counter pulling their masks down to converse. They need to also allow drivers to be able to use restrooms so we can wash our hands. Painted yellow lines for dock doors are needed too. Very slow to load trucks.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHt6Mafp6E6jsfTWJeK9JGrhaim8q7xg5saiD0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_Xe3tZA_m3mmKWGo-UKOY_e4sohZbvD8GLwfN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBx9FqffMkxYHM9LGn5XZMUGNC8hleFrnJVQbI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Lady in the shipping office is super rude. Loading times are terrible. This place is not driver friendly. I will refuse loads from this place in the future. Did I mention that they won't let you use the restroom inside. The outdoor restroom is filthy.<//text>

Unprofessional and rude STUFF!!!
Terrible service!!! Lost 1 hour only in front of checking window!!! I’m sure stocked here for all day.... 0 star!!!
After all, they put only 15 pallets and I’m overweight on my drive and steer axles, so came back with scale ticket and waiting for the door😡

...ok, they reloaded me, I saw that was overweight again, but they told me that I must bring new ticket, and you know what, weight on my drive axel was 700 pounds more then first time?!
What can I say, they are “REAL PROFESSIONALS”!
So I’m here almost 7.5 hours, and they are still reloading me🥵

And I’m back again))) third time overweight and third time reloading... It’s like - groundhog day!

After 10.5 hours and 3 times reloading, done!
Good job guys!👍<//Text>

If you like long waiting times for a dock and very long unloading times along with rude personnel then this is the place for you! If not then stay away! Do not even book loads here! You're guaranteed to eat up 8 HOS here.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Avoid this place if you value your time.
I've been waiting for over than 2H for my paperwork and I am the only one here. It's 10:30 pm and they are literally doing nothing. How could it possibly be that difficult to complete one piece of paper?< /review><rating>1</rating></record>

if you can avoid this shipper do so. tell dispatcher you are sick and going to ER. they load trucks at rate of about 1 per hour. 4 hours past appt time and the dock plate is not even in trailer yet. let alone the dock door open. looks like somebody not getting their water on time.< /Text>

yup everyone is correct. my appt was at 7pm. took them 3 hr to get a door then i was empty by 5am the next morning. Us truckers need to demand respect. loads onky pay up to 4hrs detetion so after hrs leave trailer there they will call u when ready. or just leave. no one likes workimg for free.. i doubt they come n sit at their desk for 9hrs for free. so after 4hrs just take ur load and have broker reschedule  an appt.. we have stuff do pple.. n we demand a redelivery fee.. how do u think fed ex n ups get offloaded quick.  if we have to wait thwn they should wait for their load. we should not have to waste our time...</text>

THE PEOPLE FROM SHIPPING/RCVNG & UPPER MANAGEMENT ARE RUDE & UNPROFESSIONAL & DONT CARE ABOUT OUR VALIOUS TIME. WE SHOULD REJECT ANY LOADS FROM THIS PLACE & WE PROBABLY MAKE PUR POINT ACCROSS. WE DESERVE TO BE TRATES FAIRLY & WE NEED TO BE LOADED/UNLOADED in a TIMELY FASHION.

Our favorite no frills, hands down, best tasting, authentic Mexican food restaurant in the area. Besides the great food the staff is friendly and will always accommodate some of our special, off-menu requests.
Ask them to make you a pollo-chorizo, burrito with "grandma's" salsa served wet (red sauce) and you will be one happy individual. As a hard shell taco it is excellent as well!
Enjoy!</Text>

Best Hole in the Wall Taco Place. The asada tacos are to die for. Family owned , very friendly, free  cup of soup when available and chips.  I turned this place on to many friends and they love it. They cater and can order for parties. I have for the super bowl and highly recommend.<//review>

The food is amazing!!! Pardon my 2 stars. My family recently moved to Anaheim  from Texas and decided to eat here. Their was a tent in front of the entrance and we thought you ordered tacos from the stand. The lady their rudely told my mom that you do not order tacos from her. Needless to say, my appetite was gone and I was in disbelief of the crappy customer service we had just received. We ate and received friendly customer service from within the restaurant. Someone please give that lady a class on how to keep customers! I will never step foot in here again.< /text>

The stuff pizza was very good and very cheesy. The driver was friendly and followed the directions that was given on my order. He also gave me extra garlic butter that I love. The only thing I didnt like was the cheese sauce dip, it didnt really have a taste to me.</Text>

For ten years I've held the opinion that Zachary's is better than Little Star but tonight I'm not so sure. The classic deep dish was fantastic. AND the chicken wings are the best I can remember eating. Bonus.< /Review>

<review>Great quality and you can almost taste it every time... However, the one we ordered was like we ordered half cheese, recommend check for the toppings to be evenly distributed on top, i will definitely check my pizza very good next time.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Pizza was 25 minutes late, driver got lost. He said he had paper written directions. Huh? No gps? Who is in the delivery business without modern day technology?? Paper directions?? Thomas Guide? I called and spoke to a man named Sam who identified himself as the manager. Highly doubtful due to the fact he has absolutely no customer service skills. Domino’s pizza from here on in. This papa johns is HORRIBLE! Sam or whoever the manager is in this establishment needs more training. Good luck.</text><Response>None< /Response><Pics>None<//Pics>< time>

<Text>I placed an online order which I had delivered. When I opened one of the pizza boxes, the pizza was burned on top and bottom.  I called the store and talked to Rose who said she was the Manager.  She had somewhat of an attitude and told me that ALL the pan pizzas are dark due to cooking time. Mine was not just dark, it was REALLY dark!  She said she would have another one sent out and the burned one picked up.  When the second one arrived, it was a little dark but not at all like the first one so I accepted it.  When my Mom took a slice and started eating it, there was a long hair in it! Yeck!  I didn't call back because of the manager's attitude the first time.  I just cut my losses and threw the pizza in the trash! I will not be ordering pizza from them again!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>If I could give a zero I would.  Worst experience ever! The manager this evening, Sam, so he says, not sure that’s true, needs additional training.  Had an issue with pizza delivery tonight.  25 min late. Had this been Dominos, I am sure I would have experienced much better customer service.  Unfortunately, the Rialto location is closed so I was routed to this location. Will NEVER give this location my business ever again. This location does not expect their drivers to have gps. Huh?? Doesn’t everybody have gps? Nope,  come to find out. Long story short, order your pizza from any other business.....domino’s, Pizza Hut, graziano’s, dahlias, mountain Mike’s.... you get my drift.<//Review>< time>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Thank you for the best Papa John's Pizza I've had in awhile!!!
Great help from the guy who started my order and he also got help from the manager on duty. Sounded like he might have been new, but very professional. My delivering driver was also a good!!
Explained and checked my order to make sure I was satisfied with the order.
The pizza is also great.

I had about giving up on finding the quality that I know is there. But most have been mediocre at best, so thank you for a great experience.

And to the owner of this store, way to go, you've got a great team.

I started eating Papa John's Pizza in 1993. So I know what is good, lol.</review>< user>

Good food as always, but the customer service was how it should be. Mixup on the carry out order so they threw in some extras to make up for the mistake. Not necessary because people are always going to make mistakes, but good business practice nonetheless.<//review>

I love this place! With numerous outlets and accessible wifi it's a great place to get some work done. The staff are super nice and the atmosphere here is very inviting. If your interested in a place to grab a drink, chat with the locals, or get some work done this is the place!</Text>

Great coffee & tea. Great customer service. Friendly staff. The place feels very open and clean. And with the ongoing pandemic, to say all that means a lot since some places that I've been to the staff seem frantic and not happy to help. But that wasn't the case here. The staff is really nice and making a great atmosphere for their customers.<//Review>< Rate>

<text>I would highly recommend the Guji Ardi (if available). It’s easy to drink with incredible flavors. The barista who did the pour over, couldn’t have done a better job. The coffee didn’t bite at all, just smooth from start to finish. The two barista working were kind and attentive and should be TIPPED well when you go.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< gmapID>

Turns out that my neighbor studies here too.

Minus one star because it's overpriced for its location. Minus another because it didnt seem popular with the locals.< /text>

This coffee shop c'est très chic! The ambience is perfect for studying. I got the matcha latte and shared a lemon pastry with my boyfriend and we both really liked it. I would definitely recommend the matcha latte and this location to study or just grab coffee!

If you're worried whether they are covid friendly or not, do not worry. They have specially marked signs clearly marking which table has been sanitized and have social distancing markers all around the store.

Tip: After ordering your coffee/drink ask for the wifi voucher. They give a free 8 hour wifi session!<//review>

<review>Very cool coffee shop that is doing a solid job of meeting the needs of a wide array of coffee drinkers. They really know their stuff and do a fine job roasting and serving coffee. The shop is spacious and has plenty of room for gathering, even in this current state of affairs.< /review>< Pictures>

Went to get a cup of the Earl Grey slushy, but they ran out. As a consolation prize, I got a cup of cold brew instead. I've tried cold brew from Starbucks and trader Joe's, and this is just terrible. Literally tastes like sour brown water.<//Review>

This is by far the largest coffee house I’ve ever been in my whole life. You can fit like a small concert in there. It would be a great spot to do some work in the morning or have meetings there. There always seems to be a bit of a line which is kind of odd because there’s only ever three people in there but the coffee and the croissants are to die for. 10 out of 10 would recommend<//Text>

Good coffee, cool space,  poor customer service. Don’t dare ask for espresso over ice, the arrogant trendy barista will give you a snappy response that lacks substance or any true definition of why they don’t offer that, instead he’ll just say “We don’t make ghetto lattes.” Even if you you’re willing to pay for what you want. Unfortunately friendly customer service isn't a priority in this establishment.<//text>

Baristas are nice and knowledgeable, coffee is the best I have had since leaving Portland. Atmosphere is welcoming and unique in design. Natural light and open concept makes for the perfect study spot. Large windows allow you to watch as the coffee is brewed, I couldn't be more happy to have this shop in town. I'll be back at least weekly!</Text>

<text>This is place is larger than you think. They have lots of seating and even private conference rooms. The decor and style of the place is nice & it showcases the architecture of the place. There are areas for students to come study or anyone to bring their work. They have plug ins and wifi is available for customers. On their menu, they have the same basic choices: latte, mach., coffee, etc. They have milk alternatives. The coffee is  pretty good and affordable. Their pastries are amazing and freshly made. I recommend the Almond croissant.  It's has this jam that's not too sweet and overall, very tasty. They also have KETO options. The place have so many customers coming in and picking up Keto baked goods.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Dropped in during their soft opening last week. Had a great conversation with Jonathan about their business and the coffee roasting process. Brought some beans home and enjoying the quality. Love everything about this place! May you be blessed richly in your endeavors. Welcome to our Placentia family!<//review>

<Text>Dropped by during a quiet morning. Most importantly: great coffee. Complex and well-balanced flavors.

It's also a large, elegant space, much better than the cramped properties coffee houses are often set in.

Bottom line: if you enjoy Philz or similar types of coffeehouses, this is a great local alternative that you should support.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>117239464954448607724<//userid><Response>{'time': 1569613598989, 'text': 'thanks Rob for stopping by and the kind words.'}</Response><GmapID>0x80dcd76b804de50b:0xb1969875f970f5a9<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I stumbled across this place after getting tacos across the street. It's such a nice environment. Low lighting, calm music, and very nice baristas! It's your usual cafe with wifi, seating, and great coffee. I live close by so I will definitely be coming back! All they need a good rewards app and I'm all in. Thanks for the great drink!< /Review>

<text>I was strolling around old placentia area taking a picture because of the beautiful scenery and owner of this coffee shop suddenly came out and rudely ask me not to use its photo.   I don't think they are entitled to ask that.   And his attitude was so rude out of no where.   What a waste of space in this beautiful town.</text><gmap_id>0x80dcd76b804de50b:0xb1969875f970f5a9</gmap_id>< Pics>

The smell is weird when you first step in.

It's very spacious but the seating area is not really comfortable.

I think I won't come back.<//review>

<Text>This was a coffee joint, my wife and I came for her "keto" friendly treats as they advertise. They did not have any decaf at 10:30 AM, go figure. We like the setting. Could use a few more non-highchair chairs. I had a small cup of house blend regular coffee. It was served in a nice ceramic mug (good thing). However, the coffee tasted as if it was brewed in an oldschool percolator. We will be back nonetheless... i had a bluberry muffin and was very good albeit it was on the small side. My wife loved her keto treats.<//Text>< Rating>

I'm sorry to post this...just microwaved the Vegan Curry Tiger. For what I paid it was a MAJOR disappointment in TASTE, CONTENTS AND SIZE. I had to resort to the freezer for something I could actually ENJOY.
Can you kindly coupon me for something that is actually made with ingredients tar are not skimped on for I assume Profit??< /text>

<review>Legit my FAVORITE vegetarian/vegan brand. I’m unsurprised they’re based out of California because everything is great quality and tastes like they actually tried out their food prior to selling it to thousands of people. They offer very culturally diverse foods and none of their healthy, natural, and delicious options ever get boring; there’s veggie options for every and any pallet! I don’t know where I would be without Sweet Earth on my Vegetarian journey 😭 thank you guys so much for existing! <3
I only wish they offered shipments straight from their website because I would not hesitate to buy in bulk!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I paid nearly $5.00 for the vegan General Tso's dish, and was very disappointed with the portion size. On the front of the box, it shows a generous amount of food but once opened and cooked, the amount of food is significantly less. I feel like this is false advertising. This was most certainly not worth the amount of money I paid.</review>

I purchased these two meals (General Tso's tofu and Pad Thai) for my vegetarian daughter.  Let me tell you, I ended up eating them when she was at work during the week  (shhhhh) and WOW! The absolute best frozen meals EVER! They taste like they were homemade in my own kitchen. The freshness of the vegetables and the perfectly seasoned sauces are top of the line!
I would love to be a brand ambassador! Are you hiring?!<//review>

I just tried the Pad Thai and it is so bland and bad... virtually no sweetness and NO seasoning. It is plain awful! I should have looked closely to see that it was a Nestle brand... TERRIBLE and an insult Thailand!!!<//Text>

I was looking for healthy frozen entrees that taste good. There are not that many that I can say that are healthy - vegan/vegetarian and taste good. Sweet Earth frozen entrees are the best you can get. It's hard to find that many varieties that are vegan, but Sweet Earth did it for me! Every week I make sure my freezer is full of these yummy meals! Thank you Sweet Earth for giving us the best natural/organic/vegan meals!</review>

I am not a fan of anything processed but decided to try breakfast products by this company. All I can say is HOLY COW! I was more than pleasantly surprised! I needed to have a few convenience items to get me through a busy stretch and am so glad I discovered these breakfast items. I expected to not enjoy one bite and found that I enjoyed every bite! Great job Sweet Earth - Kudos to you!<//review>

Sweet Earth has what other breakfast burritos don't: vegetarian options that are protein laden and so, filling. I had part of The Peruvian burrito for lunch, since I work in a fast paced environment and barely have time to eat, and I was sate through dinner! The variety of ingredients and taste also made my mouth happy :) Thanks for making international fare a fast fix in the frozen food aisle.<//review>

When I crunch into broccoli that is perfectly cooked and not filled with water or enjoy lentils that are toothsome and not mush it actually irritates me that frozen food can be this good and I've never experienced it until now. I've just come to accept that gross texture and weird flavors are a trade-off for convenience. But evidently it is possible to make delicious frozen food that you actually look forward to eating.</Text>

Thank you Sweet Earth Natural Foods for providing some relief in a vegetarian food desert. My town is full of chains that are very meat heavy. It is nice to take your product for lunch and have a vegetarian option that actually tastes good. From your Pizza Mac & Cheese to your Curry Tiger, I have been thoroughly satisfied. I have recently tried your breakfast sandwiches, as expected, they were tasty. I look forward to what awesome products you all make in the future. Thanks a lot!</Review>

Sweet Earth has changed my life :) I eat very healthy and live a vegan lifestyle which means I end up spending a decent amount of time preparing every meal. I do love to cook but I don't always have the time for it. I have tried all of the vegan burritos and artisan bowls and loved every one of them - especially the Kyoto Stir Fry. Thank you for providing a product that is convenient, delicious, and doesn't make me feel guilty when opting for a quick fix.<//review>

The Get Focused breakfast burrito is SO DELICIOUS. I wish it came in the larger size! I have enjoyed almost everything I've tried from Sweet Earth. The things I've been less impressed with were still good just not for me flavor wise. Quality, ingredients, and taste is excellent!</Review>

I really enjoy their products.   I was looking for something more healthy and easy to heat up at work.  I recommend their burritos (Kyoto is my favorite) and breakfast sandwiches.   Very hearty items that taste great.

Since buying their food - eating healthy is easy.</text>

We've been buying Sweet Earth's frozen burritos for several years and they are, by far, our favorites. Although previously frozen, the ingredients taste fresh and are plentiful. We've tried Amy's brand of frozen burritos and other "natural" brands and I've been unimpressed with their flavor. Sweet Earth's frozen burritos are quite delicious - my current favorite is the Peruvian - YUM.<//text>

<text>A-mazing!
This brand has some of the best vegetarian food I've ever had. I'm especially impressed with their breakfast sandwiches. They are very hearty and filling, more so than the non-vegetarian brands I've tried. Everything I've tried from Sweet Earth has been fantastic. Great job guys!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I have only had the Peruvian Burrito so far, and it was excellent! My husband tried the Power Burrito and really liked it. (That's a big deal, because he normally won't even try frozen prepared foods)  He asked me to buy more.
I can't wait to find a store that has more of the Sweet Earth foods!</Review>

Kids were concerned about trying a new healthy food, but I let them pick their own dish and they loved it!  I love your foods, and I thank you for these meals - great option when I do not want to cook, but do not want to feed my kids unhealthy fast food.  LOVE your variety as well!!<//review>

I love Sweet Earth.  Just discovered them about a month ago and have many in my freezer at home and at work.  They are tasty and low calories.  Great for lunches.  I have had a little trouble finding the product but Target seems to have the biggest variety>  Keep making more varieties.< /text>

Really great products! My only reservation is their use of eggs and cheese but I have seen them responded with the reasonable response that these products still decrease meat eating and are helpful for people transitioning to a plant based diet. Still wished they didnt do it but I'll give them 5 stars for their great products and their work to decrease meat/dairy consumption!<//Review>

<text>Absolutely love the hickory sage bacon! It's the best vegan bacon I've ever had :) the sietan is great too! I seasoned it like gyro meat and had vegan gyros for dinner last night with my special homemade vegan cucumber sauce! I will definitely be buying both products again and look forward to trying others :)< /text>< pics>

I absolutely love the vegan burritos (Big Sur, the Curry Tiger, the Anasazi, the Kyoto, Get Cultured and Lighten Up). The Benevolent Bacon is yummy too! I have yet to try the empanadas. The artisan bowls are practically empty; a complete waste of money.<//review>

<text>Outstanding plant-based frozen burritos and meals. My new addiction is the Big Sur Breakfast Burrito! -- which I (rebelliously, given the name) enjoy for dinner regularly. Their burritos are plumper and have a lot more hearty filling than other brands, such as Amy's. I also really liked their "Lighten Up!" breakfast burrito, which is filled with wholesome tofu, legumes, and greens. I am happy to find these items at Stop & Shop, and now Target. They already have many vegan offerings (the rest are vegetarian--meatless, but with dairy) and I hope they will continue to grow.< /text><Time>1470325601679< /Time>< Rate>

<review>I'm not a vegan but I buy vegan food because I'm trying to eat healthier.  This is coming from a person that favorite foods are pizza and cheeseburgers.  Your vegan breakfast are very very good!  I could eat them everyday for breakfast!   I ate the harmless ham, sun dried tomato and something else.  Unfortunately it was the last box on the shelf at one of the 5 walmarts near my house so I'll probably pick up another box at one of the others later on....Keep up the good work!< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I tried the Borderless Enchilada.  The mixture was  soupy and without flavor,  as though the sauce's components were cooked individually, and then mixed together at the end.  Then too,   every once in awhile I received a jolt from a green pepper,  which was not supported by the lackless flavor of the sauce.   I could not finish the meal,  and I  will not try your product again.< /Review>

<review>Absolutely disgusting. Looks great on the package but is really not good. I've tried the pad Thai and the burritos but always thrown them out very rubbery and overall no flavor.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Amazing products.  All vegetarian and vegan.  The burritos are easily the best on the market, lots of filling, all quality ingredients.

I see a review below that says they label vegan but not vegan.  This is totally untrue and unfortunate that someone would leave a 1 star review and damage the reputation of Sweet Earth over a completely false allegation.  The burritos with eggs/cheese are CLEARLY labeled as "veggie", on the label it mentions cage free eggs as the first ingredient and in several places mentions the eggs/dairy ingredients.  On items that are vegan, like the Big Sur, it's labeled "vegan".  It's not complicated.

Overall an excellent company making outstanding food.  I always have a freezer full of burritos at my office.  And just from looking at the constantly empty shelves at the grocery store, I'm guessing a lot of people are catching on to these.</text>

Walking into our local Target and seeing a sign hanging above one of the sections of freezers that read "Plant-Based Protein" was shocking here in the middle of Nebraska!  Inside, one of the first boxes that caught my eye was the Plant-based Lighten Up breakfast burritos.  I grabbed the 3-pack box expecting it to feel like a barely half-full carton like most other brands of anything healthy, but to my surprise it actually had weight!!  3 healthy burritos for a little over $5?  What's the catch?  The next morning I found out that the catch was that I found a catch and these things are actually really good and affordable!  I'm heading back tonight to buy the rest of them!!  Great product, keep up the good work Sweet Earth!!< /review>

Their breakfast sandwiches always looked delicious, but the price made me hesitant...I finally tried a few of them, and they are incredible. The perfect savory breakfast sandwich! The combination of the the egg, cheese, AND "bacon" make a great trifecta.<//text>

I first had your burritos---my wife and I sampled quite a few--while we were on vacation in Arkansas.  We were so happy to find burritos made with ingredients that fit the lifestyle we are trying to embody--quinoa, sweet potatoes, tofu, meatless!!  Thank you so much for making a great product.<//Review>

Yum, Yum, Yum!  I just had your product (the Peruvian burrito) for the very first time.  I can't believe how good they are.  I was actually thinking I couldn't make something myself that tasted this good.  Glad I bought other flavors for my  husband I and to try!< /Review>

<text>I'm not one for writing reviews, but I couldn't pass this one up. The veggie burger (Flame broiled Za'atar) is absolutely disgusting. I've had other  veggie burger brands and this by far is the worse. It has the most awful taste.A total waste of money and taste.

I'm frustrated right now. I love your guys' products and eat them regularly. Last week I found a large (fingernail sized) piece of hard plastic inside my burrito. I've been trying to get in touch with your customer inquiry department by calling and leaving voicemails and no one has made an attempt to reach out to me.

I wanted to let you guys know about the problem and provide you with the lot number and other info so you can do some quality control but apparently your customers aren't important to you. Since your customer inquiry department is so negligent in contacting concerned customers I have to air my dirty laundry in a public forum. I will continue calling to try and provide you this information but all around I am dissatisfied.</review>

<review>Very good frozen burritos. I discovered them at Kroger. They were on sale for 5 for $10, so what the heck. So far i've eaten a Big Sur breakfast burr,  Protein lovers breakf burr, Curry Tiger &the Peruvian (which is my favorite).  All were great and healthy ingredients.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<review>Having been a vegetarian for half a year and slowly transitioning to veganism, I have relied on many of their products for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I have yet to be disappointed! My favorite items so far have been the benevolent bacon, protein lovers and lighten up burritos, and the harmless ham and chickpea and meatless sausage, egg and gouda breakfast sandwiches. I have also tried the chipotle style seitan, but it wasn't my favorite. The only recommendation I would give for this company is if they can try to make a few products without soy (tofu).<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>I've recently switched to a vegan diet. My first time trying Sweet Earth was last week. I got the Teriyaki veggie burgers using a bogo coupon. I was very pleased with the taste as well as the texture. I've heard a lot about the Big Sur burrito, so I think I'll try that next.< /Text>< resp>

The Big Sur burrito has 18 grams of protein. For under 4 dollars, ill take it.

Simply some of the best stuff you can get in stores.<//Review>< username>

I like Sweet Earth Foods . Practicing Veganism currently. From Utah ☺😴😫 . But I live in California . Buying most of their products from Target , I encountered a confusion with the " BIG SUR BREAKFAST " 3 pack burrito combo . On the box . . . it says " 11 grams " of protein on the box . . . Target was selling the 3 pack for $5.49 and I was wondering if EACH burrito had 11 grams of protein in them , or is it 11 grams of protein after eating ALL 3 burrito's ? . . . Attempting to avoid as much animal food as possible so getting enough plant protein everyday is extra important to me. What really confused me is that for $5.00 , At Target , you could AT THE SAME TIME get 2 big Sur burritos but each contained 17 GRAMS OF PROTEIN . I called Sweet Earth twice but no one answered both times , to question them about the topic , as I've previously stated . I just bought the 3 pack for $5.49 AND 2 single burrito's for $5.00 anyways . . . ate them ALL. #electronicbenefittransfer . Pretty tasty ! 2 and a HALF stars Google 😓 . . . And they are out of " Kyoto " at Target in Crenshaw last time i shopped .</Text>

Being vegetarian and living in the central part of Wisconsin has been challenging to find new food products to fit my lifestyle.....but after having my first Sweet Earth Protein Lover's Burrito.....I fell in love :)  I wanted more and checked out their website only to discover there were so many more items to choose from, and sadly the grocers in my area did not carry SE products on a regular basis.  I contacted SE and a great customer rep named Colby Nordyke helped me locate other stores (albeit 80 miles away from my home) that carried their product line extensively.  I am happy to say that today I made the long round trip down to Madison, WI with a large ice chest and loaded up with SE frozen food products of all kinds!  And of course I could not wait to try one of the entrée bowls once returning home, and it was outstanding in flavor and superior taste!!  The Sweet Earth food product line is absolutely the best tasting ever and far exceeds the usual brands I have purchase over the years, such as Boca, Morningstar and Amy's.  SE also has a form letter for the consumer to take to their local grocers to request they carry their products.....which I have gladly done!  In the meantime I will make it a point to drive the distance as I LOVE the Sweet Earth Foods, and its worth it to stock up my freezer!!< /review>

I have tried the baja Big Sur breakfast burrito, the mushroom ravioli, the borderless enchilada and the enchilada suiza entrees and all were delicious. I like the convenience of having a good meal that I can quickly prepare in the microwave.</text>

This seitan is amazing.  Now I don't have to go the the vegetarian restaurant across town to get great seitan -- I can just make it at home.  Just paired their Chipotle - style seitan with a bowl of brown rice -- it was great.</Review>

Eggs, and milk are not vegan… im not sure why they would think its ok to label a burrito, "vegan", and have it contain those two animal products. Can't believe that a company would ever think that's ok.<//review>

A fun shopping experience.  Great prices. I love how they set up the rooms to show you the potential of their furniture. They even show the square footage and the cost of the entire room. Don't forget to stop for some Swedish meatballs at the cafeteria.  They're very organized and everything moves swiftly. Even if you're not buying furniture,  it's fun to walk around and pick up little accessories and treats you didn't know you needed.<//text>

<text>Really great tour of the store! It lets you borrow a bag to shop with, has clearly marked directions and arrows telling which direction to go so you don't miss anything. The "rooms" are staged and showcased, prices and descriptions are on each item and someone is always around to help you if you need it. A unique shopping experience!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Comprehensive store, good quality product. Great European designs, and good value.  Great helpful team. Customer service almost doesn't exist over the phone. You must visit the store if you have an issue.< /Review>

<text>this is the newest and largest Ikea in Southern California as far as I know.  Good place to walk around the Swedish inspired labyrinth and even get some food at the restaurant.  Ikea isn't top quality for the most part but it does sell pretty European style decor and furniture.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a</Gmap_id></record>

The parking is below the entire store. Plus it's they have better stock because they are larger. But if I didn't need to come to this location, 10x target go to the Costa Mesa one. It's not as hectic, the line to pay is lot organized and the associates still friendlier.

Restock your inventory or take the display items out of the floor. You have been advertising items you haven't restocked in years. Why waste people's time? Ikea is great but it's based on a system where you kind of need items in stock. Your not a museum or art gallery.< /Review>

Great prices for great furniture. Its a maze in there, but it was fun walking around day dreaming about how to decorate. You can get just about anything you would ever need for a house, apartment, or room there. They are doing a great job keeping clean with covid as well. I felt safe with the small amount of people they let in, and with their cleaning routine.</Review>

I felt safe shopping there according to the rules. Not so safe based on other shoppers not taking those rules seriously. As with all IKEA locations I’ve been to, the top floor is an absolute maze that it can be difficult to not get lost in but they’ve set it up better now during the pandemic so it’s really one way traffic and you just keep following the path. I like that and almost wish it would stay like that always.< /review>< Resp>

Our first visit to IKEA Burbank since they moved from downtown Burbank years ago. We love the selection of household items here and especially with the spacious restaurant within the store where the food is good but affordable. I had the Chicken Strips with Fries and Vegetables and the Almond Cake. Such comfort food!< /review>

However, I didn't rate a 5 as some of the customer service employees don't seem to be too knowledgeable of what's inside the box, so I had to buy slate for a frame that already had some in the box.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Out of the IKEAs that I've been to in LA County this one is by far the better one. They have a covered parking garage and a cafeteria serving you IKEA's signature foods.

The cafeteria is up and running now and they have their process down where you'll be assigned a table. Simple and easy!

Not sure why all the low ratings for this location. Prob just people venting per usual. Not many complaints for me other than they were out of stock of some items.

Just to note, you can check inventory stock on their website and get notifications when it arrives or check other stores to see if they have it instead.< /Review>

Restaurant is open but you have to wait in line to be assigned a table then gather your food and drinks. All self serve drink fountains and any self serve areas are closed.
There is no monitoring of tables someone was sitting at the table that was assigned to me so I just sat at a nearby table!!
Store is well merchandised and there are express self checkout lanes which allowed for quick exit.<//Review>

They're very organized. The only thing is that they don't have much stock but I think it's becuase they're barley opening back up and there is a lot of people going and buying ATM. Great place to shop and it's very straightforward. If you need help simply ask there is a lot of associates that can help you.< /Review>

<Text>Under most circumstances, I am a fan of IKEA and it’s nuances but under the pandemic rules it has become a nightmare to navigate. The Burbank IKEA  is very family un-friendly. From having overly complicated navigation routes to get where a person needs to go, to targeting the younger children if their mask isn’t high enough on their face. Overall this place is unfriendly, uncaring and the veneer of “cozy” feels as plastic as the furniture. For a much more family friendly experience visit the Covina location instead. It is much more laid back and pleasant experience.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1g8yX1_1ZBc2e5hHVpFN5ERhwU4IlcumUoRkO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOc-MwjJk68istmpa_FtktrwAATecC0yhkGCurj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVulK-gmBG4Hwm3dFYSNQGkyFTJD46x5zZ63Ex=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdK30dfieSUMArNOwTVXPP5Vd6GycZeK96ytd3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi1KvSLsA7T9S-FnZOpK5nP9g0d6ZiB7sl4d03=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgv-jGVkmmAHW5YhyXAkStziOi8Lql7IrfQ9lq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5uYKgfhZFg81qNXL095cEzIuTxzt9-U3slDoI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a<//gmap_id></record>

Ikea: great for cardio, interior design, and orienteering. Which way is north? Where is the exit? One does not simply "go" to Ikea. If consumerism were a religion, Ikea is the spiritual journey. Godspeed my friends and good luck on the voyage. PS - I went 30 minutes before the entrance closes on a Thursday night and walked right in, no line.< /Text>

IKEA is ikea. Consistent product that doesn't vary much from store to store. I needed big white zipper bags, a staple they no longer carry, but salmon lunch was motivation to take 2 buses out to Burbank.  Not beautiful Downtown Burbank (Laugh-In joke).  Entry to store from San Fernando is past the Tesla dealer. I of course hobbled to a supermarket instead because I saw the big IKEA sign before getting off the 96 bus. Pedestrian signs from bus stop would be helpful.  Realized I am too old and decrepit to navigate the long walk to the store and the vast maze once inside. The salmon was delicious.< /review>

The person handling my returns was not the speediest or most capable but they were able to eventually get the returns made, which I appreciated.

Beware: due to COVID restrictions, there is a line to get into the store! The wait is longer on the weekends. An employee told me the times with the shortest lines are Mon-Wed morning.</review>

<review>Terrible experience!!! The online pick up service offered by IKEA is absolutely the worst I’ve ever encountered. Online I was instructed to show up between 10 AM and 1 PM. I arrived and scanned the QR code at exactly 11:00 AM I did not leave the parking lot until 1:20 PM. There were only 10 people in front of Muño. The que when I arrived. It is absolutely shameful how astoundingly bad this specific service is operated in managed. I would advise nobody to make this mistake. Never use this online pick up service. Either go inside and shop it will be a much faster experience or simply pay for the delivery.</review>< Pics>

I been waiting to get the Alex drawer from Ikea but they would always be so out when I go to the check out or the click and collect wasn't available. I didn't want to go inside the store because last time I tried, there was a long line just like waiting for a ride at Disneyland. So I finally sat in front of my computer and kept checking for my item to be available then around 8pm I was able to select Click & Collect option. The first time I couldn't press the Confirm button when I selected Burbank so I just refresh the page and I was able to do it the second time. I went the next day in the morning at 10am and I was able to find the Click & Collect location by following the sign in the parking structure. There systems of checking in is really bad compared to other places. They couldn't sent a email with the QR code or number so you have it ahead of time to speed up things but of course they didn't. I waited like 10 minutes for my item to come out cause there was just 1 lady helping the 4 people that was there.</review>< username>

<text>Would not complete a return during normal business hours. I drove an hour to make an exchange to fin out that they stop doing returns 3 hours before closing. Manager refused to help with that issue. A company this big should be able to afford one associate to run their returns.

Great customer service, easy pick up. But it would be even easier and more convenient to pick up your online order without having to get out of your car. Now you have to get out and scan a code in order to start the process of picking up. It would be easier if i could do it without having to leave my car. Maybe put the QR code on the sign with the parking number.  As someone with kids i could appreciate that. Now i had to unload kids from the car put them in  stroller just to go scan the code and return to my car. Kids were sleeping so i woke them up to do that. If i could notify them that I'm there without leaving the car, kids would have continued sleeping in the car while waiting for our order.<//Review>

Love this place, staff are always friendly and helpful, which is nice because that place is a giant maze. Food court is good, love the frozen yogurt and cinnamon buns. Affordable items, always end up leaving with more than I intend to.<//review>

<rate>4< /rate><review>It’s a popular place so it can be very busy during peak hours. Long line waiting to enter the store due to social distancing. Line is similar to theme park but there isn’t any ride so come here with some comfortable shoes and clothes. Waiting time could be up to 75 minutes. I had to leave after waiting in line for 30 minutes on a Sunday.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This location had every set up looking professional. It was an experience that I have never imagined from a furniture store. I felt like if I was at Disneyland. Every single item that was displayed had an easy to see price tag.
Never knew how much they had to offer.
The only thing I recommend is that you plan accordingly, because the whole store tour took me about 2 hours, and I only went in to get a bath towel 😅.

The pandemic safety procedures were so quick and there was no line to wait on.</text>< Pictures>

Packed to the gills with customers, everyone is shoulder to shoulder bumping into you, 20-30 min wait for the restaurant that you have to make a reservation for now, and everything I was looking for was sold out.

Giving 2 stars for the cleanliness of the store, but the employees all seem miserable at this location and all the display rooms are disheveled and a mess from customers.

Will only be back because my girlfriend wants to get some things here for our new place but I can't stand this store.

I highly suggest Living Spaces instead.< /Text>

Paid $15 for an item on my credit card.  Forgot my receipt. Can't return it. What about a store credit? So I can spend more money at your store. Nope. I must have a physical copy of a receipt.  I had to call some random number to get my invoice number.  At the other end of the line, a male voice with thick Indian accent asked for my bank account numbers, where did I buy it, and the date it was purchased.   Really Ikea?  We live in a technology age, and you can't run my card to check my purchase history.<//review>

<text>A swedish disneyland that never seems to end. One minute your excited, screaming inside like a little girl. The Next minute your trying to go home and struggling to find the exit. You search and you search and you search yet the products go on and on like some f'ed up furniture library. You feel old and cold, until finally a glimpse of light appears at the end of the blue and yellow painted labyrinth. You walk faster hoping to finnaly be rid of all that which has contained you for that last 3 hours. You make it, but only to find your stuck in another labrynth called society and your surrounded by idiots. Good luck!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

BEST VALUE BREAKFAST AVAILABLE in LOS ANGELES area in my opinion (Store located in Burbank, which is a short drive from Los Angeles) It is unbelievable what you can get for your money. The Swedish Pancakes are DELICIOUS. Where else can you buy eggs, sausage, potatoes, and pancakes WITH a drink for $5.00?  I Love Ikea, and Love the Cafe just as much!  Breakfast Hours are from 9:30a to 11a daily. Drinks are even self serve, so you can go back for seconds.There is ample parking in the attached parking garage. Since the restaurant is in the front of the store. You don't even need to enter the store and buy anything to enjoy the food at IKEA Cafe. I imagine some people go just for the reasonable food, without even shopping. Highly Recommend the Swedish Pancakes! YUMMY<//text>

There was a line to get in, but it moved very quickly. Only thing I did not see was the "Click & Collect" signage, but the staff were very helpful in steering me the right direction. I don't have a car, so it's possible the signs were in the parking area.< /Text>

The best real life pintrest board. I go here to get some ideas on how to decorate my current apartment and my brand new home. There are some cheaper furnitures and home decor but be careful because there are some furnitures and home decor you can find cheaper at other places. This time I went to buy some plates and glasses because my kitchen in practically empty. Each piece cost me 79 cents each! Pretty good price for the quality. Limited styles though.< /review>

<review>My last experience visiting this location wasn’t the greatest due to an extremely long line. I left after seeing hundreds of people waiting in line to get in.

I’m still giving this store a 5 star rating because they did an exceptional job at following social distancing guidelines throughout the entire line and were clearly at maximum capacity for the store after reopening to the public.

I always have a great experience at this location and I’m sure this visit would have been the same, had I waiting in line to get in.<//review>< rate>

I recently bought 2 MALM desks white, 55 1/8x25 5/8 "
602.141.59  and upon assembly, found that the bottom  board form the cabinet had not been drilled.  Opened the other desk and found the exact same issue.  Tried calling Ikea but they don't answer.  Tried emailing their support but you can only request cancellations.  Terrible service and product quality.< /Text>

I do not like the confusing floor plan layout of Ikeas. Many of their products don't have product descriptions on their labels or the labels are confusing, making it difficult to figure out exactly what the item is.. Quality of their merchandise is questionable.
Most of their cookware feels cheap and thin and has edges that are too sharp. Their white dinner plates stain easily. Sheets have very low thread count. Eating utensils don't have the steel/nickel ratio listed on the package.</review>

This was a zoo per usual. However, the store has put in place some things that make traffic a little easier to navigate throughout the store and throughout checkout.<//Review>

Usually busy however this day Today I was In and Out in less than 30mins. Service at the Cashier is great. However good luck finding someone on the floor and when you do they look the other way as if they didn't see or hear you.<//Review>

Had to return extra kitchen cabinet parts, but the prices are pretty good. This guy Neil was a great help in measuring my kitchen, and I was given a whole year to return my stuff and the staff were helpful, courteous  and quick. The cabinets in the kitchen are beautiful. Well done IKEA<//text>

Very quick in and out buy on a metal shelve. I like the Quick search of the item on the computer shows revealed that there was still a stock on the item Omar steel shelve on the specific aisle and bin! I was looking for a 4 level and 7-8 level. Thanks for the customer service for quickly helping me identify that the 4 level metal shelve can be turned to the 8 level shelve by just putting it on top of the other!  Lots of parking in the basement, mask and social distancing are observed.< /Text>

With limited capacity going on the showroom was easy to navigate without clumps of people blocking the way and the actual warehouse for procuring foods seemed like a ghost town. No waiting at the express self check-out lines made egress a breeze.

My one complaint is that ordering online for pickup is totally impossible. I would expect a place such as IKEA to have this figured out.</Review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<date>1612407901273</date><Text>1/30/21: This store is super organized. The ground level parking has been cordoned off so you have to park in the basement. There's a queue(I went on a weekend and the queue was really long - >30mins) to get I to the store since the admin is controlling the number of people in the store. You're not allowed to use your own bags and there's no eating/drinking while in the store.
Most office supplies (chairs/desks etc.) Are limited in supply so check stock online before making the trek and waiting in the queue.
Once inside, they maintain a single direction of movement and everything is kept really clean.
This place is really well organized.</Text><gmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a</gmapID><username>Sunil Karanjikar< /username></record>

<Review>Can't beat prices on furniture and it looks ultra modern. This place is great! Just be careful what you buy, it is easy to pick up the wrong box because they have the same names for different things sometimes. I got the coolest $40 rug here 👍 can't beat that any where...</Review>< pictures>

IKEA has good food, good service, and amazing furniture. I would advise to get there early, before it opens to get good parking and a spot in line. It is very busy. I would advise to do your research before going to the store.<//text>

<Text>1/30/21: This store is super organized. The ground level parking has been cordoned off so you have to park in the basement. There's a queue(I went on a weekend and the queue was really long - >30mins) to get I to the store since the admin is controlling the number of people in the store. You're not allowed to use your own bags and there's no eating/drinking while in the store.
Most office supplies (chairs/desks etc.) Are limited in supply so check stock online before making the trek and waiting in the queue.
Once inside, they maintain a single direction of movement and everything is kept really clean.
This place is really well organized.</Text>< pics>

<text>It's huge, right now during covid it's nice, well organized and it does not fill crowded. The eating area is closed, in case your coming to get some food. The one at the exit is open , but limited. And if you been at IKEA you pretty much know what's up.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

< review>
BEST VALUE BREAKFAST AVAILABLE in LOS ANGELES area in my opinion (Store located in Burbank, which is a short drive from Los Angeles) It is unbelievable what you can get for your money. The Swedish Pancakes are DELICIOUS. Where else can you buy eggs, sausage, potatoes, and pancakes WITH a drink for $5.00?  I Love Ikea, and Love the Cafe just as much!  Breakfast Hours are from 9:30a to 11a daily. Drinks are even self serve, so you can go back for seconds.There is ample parking in the attached parking garage. Since the restaurant is in the front of the store. You don't even need to enter the store and buy anything to enjoy the food at IKEA Cafe. I imagine some people go just for the reasonable food, without even shopping. Highly Recommend the Swedish Pancakes! YUMMY< /review>

It’s like going to Disneyland but with no fun rides! Just lots of furniture! Always fun to go to.  The staff is always happy and helpful.  Only problem is when they out of stuff, yet other IKEA’s have it? You’re the biggest IKEA in North America! How are u out of something?  Ok... I still love u!< /review>

My girlfriend and I were in the other day looking for a wardrobe to give us some more storage in our bedroom and Elias was great. He helped us put together the perfect custom piece.

Thanks so much Elias!!<//Review>

<Review>IKEA has good food, good service, and amazing furniture. I would advise to get there early, before it opens to get good parking and a spot in line. It is very busy.

Products shown online are not in store, even when the website says the item is available with ample supply in store.  Parking is nightmare... the maze inside is extended outside for getting inside the store.  There is no cutting through to get to item you want without going through the entire store.  If there is a hell on earth it's this IKEA store... infact I rather go back and live in a refugee camp in Syria than go to this store again.</text>

<review>The store has implemented social distancing precautions. Only so many people allowed in the store at any time. The line to get in takes up most of the upper level of the parking area. Some tents are in place to provide cover from the sun. All the employees were wearing masks, and there were sanitizing wipes available. The employees were still friendly and helpful.
Lots of thing in the HOME OFFICE category were out of stock or had very low stock.

Its still Ikea. Its HUGE! but its still like all the other Ikeas<//review><Date>1610331448157<//Date>< Rating>

Simply too many people during my most recent visit, not unlike a normal day at IKEA.  Except this is not a normal day.  In the unprecedented COVID era, there's simply no way to make this work.  Even though literally hundreds of people, lined up some social distanced and others not.  It is no wonder that the infection rate of LA county is as high as it is.  We immediately turned around and drove home.  We'll come back another day, either when more people are vacinated or the foot traffic is much lower.<//text>

<Text>IKEA is on it with the sanitation. However, prepare to wait in a long line to even enter the store, returns and exchanges too. If you're physically disabled just ask if you can skip the line or be accommodated. Their restaurant and cafeteria are closed, but their little food/grocery area after the check stands are open.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great location, it's just enormous. Parking can be an absolute nightmare if you go on the weekends but during the week it's a very enjoyable shopping experience. Price are incredibly low and I love that they have staged rooms so you can see the product you're looking to buy. Staff is friendly and helpful and the cafeteria inside has surprisingly fantastic food.<//Text>< Resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I love LoVEEEEEEEEE IKEA!! They have all kinds of stuff for your home and different prices at that. You go in and out. FYI i would grab either a cart and a big blue bag for when you are walking towards your car. You cannot take the cart. It saves you the hassle. If you have never been to IKEA do yourself a favor and check them out!! (sincerely a person who lives near LA)< /review>< Resp>

They have all the proper social distancing signs on the floor, tons of hand sanitation stations, a big tarp to shade people waiting in line to go inside. My only suggestion would be to allow people in based on how many leave the store. Once I was inside I realized how crowded some areas were and unfortunately many people have no concept of social distance or personal space for that matter. Over all I managed to walk away from crowded areas.
Also there are limited number of certain items so beware. Over all I will say my experience was positive. The staff was extraordinarily helpful and upon leaving, it was great to see staff at the elevators ensuring only 4 people would go in to the elevator. They are definitely doing their best to keep people healthy.

Thank you Ikea.< /review>< pictures>

The customer service at this store is the actual worst I’ve ever experienced every single time I come here
I am currently standing outside on hold with the headquarters because they refuse to lookup a receipt here at the store as part of their “new policy”
Additionally the employees are extremely rude every time
I love ikea and that’s why I keep coming back but the service stays the same= horrible terrible poopy</Review>

Ikea: great for cardio, interior design, and orienteering. Which way is north? Where is the exit? One does not simply "go" to Ikea. If consumerism were a religion, Ikea is the spiritual journey. Godspeed my friends and good luck on the voyage.

PS - I went 30 minutes before the entrance closes on a Thursday night and walked right in, no line.</Review>

I love IKEA, then why just 3 stars? First, this place is huge. I'm so tired from walking the entire store twice because I missed what I was looking for the first time around. Second, in the end I purchased 2 items that I was not there to purchase. The item I wanted was looking for was not the right size and color and material. I realized that this place was designed to have me buy stuff that I don't really need, an impulsive buying. Third, the checkout line took an awful long time. There is no express lane for customers with 5 items or less. Finally, the parking lot signs were not clear on how to exit. So I went around the park lot a couple of times to finally exit. It's a huge parking structure, and there is no good sign indicating a way out. Otherwise, I love the simplicity, affordability, and sensibility of the stuff IKEA sells, including the cafeteria food.<//text>

I love ikea, but there is 45 minutes waiting time to enter, which can be solve by opening more cash registers. Large store has only 5 or 6 cash registers open and another waiting line to check out.<//Review>

I like the store, but do not go with time or hungry because it is like a big maze. However they give you really good ideas for home decoration and organization. I found nice stuff at great prices.<//text>

A top spot for quality swedish food. Don't fret if it's busy, it is worth the wait. The staff was helpful and kind. The bill was appropriate. Feels similar to a cafe in Chicago I liked.</text>

<user>112158011838733099135</user>< Review>
Customer service is fantastic. My only concern would be that some of the sale prices with the yellow banners don't actually have the product code so it's difficult to determine what they're talking about and then when you get to the cashier it rings up the incorrect price. So my suggestion is take a picture of those signs and utilize it as you're checking out because it's a pain in the neck to try to go all the way upstairs or around the store looking for the correct product. Especially if there is no indication on the sign of which of the products with the same name is actually the one that's on sale.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Just wanted to congratulate the Ikea staff for doing such a great job. I was there today, on a cold, rainy Saturday and the place was packed. Even with all Covid-related restrictions, they managed to be very efficient with crowd control. The staff inside was the same, being both polite and efficient. Also, despite the fact that there was a huge line of people, I was in within 15 minutes. And to finish this review, just sharing that I had much worse Ikea experiences in other locations in the pre-Covid world. Good job folks!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Long line, about a half hour wait. It was very hot the day we went but they do a pretty good job of keeping everyone under tents and out of the sun.
Oh, I almost forgot. Take some cash to buy ice cold water. They do not accept  cards and there is no ATM to use.
Other than that, its IKEA. You can find good things.</Review>

<Review>IKEA has always been a favorite even if you only have $20 to spend you can get some satisfying little nicknax or gifts for yourself, my favorite thing is seeing the creative ways you can decorate small spaces. It's like magic mountain for your home decor outside of your friends like costworld, pier 1, tj maxx etc, or Ross they bring a different type of creativity to your imagination and like trader joe's they have bomb unique pastries and beverages you can try from other countries, it's fun for the whole family. I call it a trip.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The service provided by the staff is excellent. I love the food at the food court is a good quality. The only thing is the maze like situation.i went on a saturday and it had a lot of people, it felt kind of claustrophobic going by the store in zigzag way.<//review>

<text>I wasted my time. They do not explain how to purchase things. I wanted a bed frame and baby crib but they didn't explain how everything was purchase. I got the crib frame but couldn't find the mattress i needed to go all the way back upstairs to get it and just left it all behind. Made me mad. Left without a purchase. Bad first time Experience.< /text>< pics>

<Review>This store is just great!  They have just about anything you may need and then some.    The new store is larger but the idea is the same.   Walk through the whole store and you will leave with something, even if you go looking for nothing.
Right now with the COVID 19 rules, expect to wait in line, perhaps a long, long line.</Review>< Pictures>

Ikea is my place! So I get there early, not even realizing they're not quite open. So me and a group get greeted by one of the associates - super politely letting us know we're about 20 minutes early. We all mill around in one of the mock up living rooms commenting on what we would and wouldn't but which is more often a would-buy and before you know they open. By then I've written down and taken pictures of a few items I wanna get. Good stuff. I'm walking through realize they have the little cafeteria and proceed to ball out on breakfast - eggs, juice a muffin thing - $3! Love this place. Find my chair and my table, I'm out. Return line can be long but they move quickly. Super clean, great deals, decent products. Do it yourself or have them put together some items. Great website too.< /text>

3 stars for order pick up! Wait forever to get your items, when you could've done so in the store. Just a dump system even though it keeps things in order, but very frustrating, especially after spending 3 hours in the store.</review>

<Text>Good stuff, but staff is incompetent. Never had someone enforce a ‘10 item or less’ line when there’s plenty of available registers, and I had maybe 15 items. Please train your staff better, Ikea.< /Text>< Pictures>

Not a good place to be at during a pandemic. The employees are really good. They put in all their efforts to make sure we keep our distance, wear facemask, not everyone is inside the store at once, etc. The problem is that once you're inside people do not respect distance. At times it seems as if people are having a party. A lot of noise, a lot of people in one section, no respect for distance or others. If you really must go wear two facemasks and a face shield. If you don't have to go, don't go.< /text>

Tried to call to ask questions, was told over and over again to go online. They can't answer the questions I have online. They hung up after I pressed the button to talk to someone (not before telling me to shop online again, though). I can't find a direct store number. I'm aware of their poor quality items, but I wasn't aware of their equally poor online and phone customer service. Go somewhere else, unless you're in the cult or a broke student. And remember, couches don't have to be uncomfortably hard. They should be soft.< /Text>

Extremely unhelpful customer service. I asked if I could pick up and pay for the item at customer service. Or pay over the phone. Because of the virus I did not want to go inside the store and look for the item. I am over 65 and there are way too many people at IKEA. No, No, No. IKEA would not help me. Even giving the cashier the item number was denied. I was told the only option was to go into the store, find a salesperson to write up the sale even though I have the numbers, pay the cashier, and then pick up the sofa outside. Extremely unreasonable. IKEA is not the same store. Cheaper products, invisible salespeople, NO cutomer service.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a</gmapID></record>

Great place to shop for your home/business, they offer great deals and decor ideas. Good place to grab some food if you're hungry, with market attached that sells what is sold at the restaurant. Sign up for an IKEA family card.</review>

I try to think of excuses to go to IKEA.  This is the best one on the West Coast for sure.  Really appreciated how they limit the amount of people coming into the store.  And, they make sure that masks are over both nose and mouth before letting someone come inside.<//review>

<text>Even with a long line to get in. The Covid process was efficient and plenty of pop up shades were covering the line effectively.
Once inside it was very well organized for social distancing.
I was a little disappointed in the large number of items not available.  It seemed as though many of the items on out list were not in stock.  Seems like supply chain is suffering the effects along with the rest of us.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

The Scoop!< /username>
<time>1610770233270< /time>< Text>
My wife asked for directions out of the building...and NO, IT'S NOT ALWAYS SO OBVIOUS, and a woman told her, "I can't talk right now, I'm working." I told an employee and he defended her saying she was probably stressed out from dealing with customers all day . Hopefully, this will get IKEA's attention. I would have rather have emailed their customer service, but the only option on the drop down menu was returning items. No, I don't want to call and have my complaint disappear. IKEA has a 2nd world attitude about a lot of things. It's not a customer friendly company. Unless company's bottom line is affected, they don't care. Maybe if someone does a Tiktok to really get their attention. Show them the customer is boss.</Text>

This place is amazing! They now have family friendly parking which great for me, my wife and our 14 month old baby! The lay out is similar to the old Ikea but much more space to walk around. Plus the dining area is nice and huge!< /review>

So yes , with this pandemic the lines are ridiculously long but if you get there around 9am 9:30am you should be one of the first few people to get in ASAP. It’s a bit of a wait in line til they open but totally worth it. They don’t have many items in stock so be prepared to see many empty shelves and if you’re lucky enough they might have 1 out of the 3 items your looking for in stock. Very safe and sanitary!</Review>

This place is huge! Easily you can get lost. They do have a lot of knowledgeable associates to help. But my favorite part is their food court or restaurant. Quick service, good food, reasonable price. Try the meatballs, really good. A plate, drink and soup on the side should be less then $10.</Text>

<Review>Can't get enough of this place. Anything I change in my house, Ikea has it.
Only bad time I ever had here, I went 2 weeks ago. I was looking for a desk for my son. They were completely sold out on ALL desks but my fault for waiting so long to get one.< /Review>< Pics>

This IKEA is located in a convenient part of the city.  The service is on point here with helpful staff and a well trained management.   Parking is super easy and people for the most part were quite courteous.

I recommend this idea if you’re in the Los Angeles area.  They seem to have a large part of not the entire IKEA collection.  So get ready for a good shopping day.  Thank you again and happy shopping to all of you out there.<//text>

<Review>Horrible horrible store.  Never will step foot in the store again ever. Cannot believe someone talk to me and to going into the store.  The staff here is horrible they don't want to be here they don't want to help. they're busy barking orders and telling you where to go and where you can't go. Once you get in you can't get out.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This post is during the coronavirus pandemic...

There was a one hour wait to get into the store. (I posted a picture of the entrance to the waiting line. There was another tent similar sized to have to wait on). We went around midday. There was shade most of the time, but definitely not conducive for those who cannot be on their feet for too long.

Once in the store, there were not enough employees to help us navigate. Once we found an employee, he was very nice, but wasn't able to find the item we needed.

This is NOT a 'run in, grab what you need, get out' type of store. You need to dedicate a good few hours of your day.

There is also a line to return or exchange.

Not the shopping experience I will be running back to in the near future.< /text>

The food is actually really good. I normally will get the Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes and the seasonal vegetable. This time I also got the blueberry cheesecake. The food is always fresh and always tastes really good. The only negative thing is that since this is a very busy Ikea, the lines for the food are always very, very long and during my last visit it took approximately 25 minutes to get through the line. Other than that my experience in the food court is good. The employees are very nice as well.</Review>< gmapID>

Does not matter whether you know exactly what you want. You still have walk miles in maze of the show floor to get to the warehouse maze to locate your item.

The staff are oblivious and unfriendly.<//text>

I'm really fond of the restaurant here. I had salmon both cutlet and cured, and I like their almond cake. I also had a new soup of theirs which was a green super soup which was really good tasty and that might even have been healthy. also I don't know why the coffee here is so good but it is. juices are very tempting like the Ligon Barre, pear, and lemon, but I think they have too much sugar. The chocolate cake is classic though. I have had breakfast here once and I thought it was terrible, but the dinner is very very worthwhile. I plan to go for the Christmas buffet this year</Text>

I give IKEA Restaurant and Cafe 5 stars because it is soooooooo INEXPENSIVE!! Their (forgot the name of the breakfast...it's the one with a variety $2.99!!)... and the Swedish pancake was yummy and their Lingonberry sauce is delicious...I gave 5 stars because of price and food doesn't taste bad...if you sign up IKEA Family card you get free coffee!!
Customer service is neutral...it's like cafeteria style where they put food on your plate.< /text>

<review>Love this place and forget about hiking or running in the morning, you get a work out walking through the entire store. It's huge, I got lost twice. I wish they had better signs with arrows showing you the way towards the exit only because it's frustrating trying to figure it out on your own. I have purchased many items from Ikea and I have always been happy with the purchases.< /review>< GmapID>

<Text>Even with a long line to get in. The Covid process was efficient and plenty of pop up shades were covering the line effectively.
Once inside it was very well organized for social distancing.
I was a little disappointed in the large number of items not available.  It seemed as though many of the items on out list were not in stock.  Seems like supply chain is suffering the effects along with the rest of us.<//Text><user_name>Yohn Rosqui</user_name></record></dataset><record>

It was their first day opening. And I know first hand the anxiety of that. But from my perspective, not only did they make me feel safe, they made me feel welcome. I celebrate the whole wide team that day and that week, because I did come back later that week, from 3 hours away; another customer I met in the long 3 hour wait under the canopies set up to
protect us from the heat, that was from 6 hours away, it was well worth the wait, spaced, welcomed, and safe.

Thank you for all the hard work, thank you for all that you provided, my home feels more like a home. Please despite the complaints or aggression you may once receive here or there, you ALL deserve more than a five star rating on google.< /Text>

I went around 1:40 and I’m guessing it wasn’t so packed since it was Saturday. This has been my third time coming here. First during COVID

Good:
Staff is good at enforcing the COVID safety guidelines, good organization, and systems to avoid big crowds of people

Bad:
Right now Im guessing because of COVID there’s a lot of things out of stock
Like I was unable to find an Alex drawer for a desk BUT the computers said the item would be restocked on the 23 so 👍</text>< Pictures>

Great place get almost A to Z of your need for day to day items. Due to COVID-19 you should expect outdoor line to endear. You can get fantastic Scandinavian and European style items.< /Review>

< review>
This IKEA is located in a convenient part of the city.  The service is on point here with helpful staff and a well trained management.   Parking is super easy and people for the most part were quite courteous.

I recommend this idea if you’re in the Los Angeles area.  They seem to have a large part of not the entire IKEA collection.  So get ready for a good shopping day.  Thank you again and happy shopping to all of you out there.< /review>

Horrible horrible store.  Never will step foot in the store again ever. Cannot believe someone talk to me and to going into the store.  The staff here is horrible they don't want to be here they don't want to help. they're busy barking orders and telling you where to go and where you can't go. Once you get in you can't get out.<//text>

Delicious food, meatballs and salmon are a must try.... this warehouse has too many home items to choose from, I suggest you spend several hours in this location, it’s the biggest IKEA around<//Text>

<Response>None<//Response><text>This post is during the coronavirus pandemic...

There was a one hour wait to get into the store. (I posted a picture of the entrance to the waiting line. There was another tent similar sized to have to wait on). We went around midday. There was shade most of the time, but definitely not conducive for those who cannot be on their feet for too long.

Once in the store, there were not enough employees to help us navigate. Once we found an employee, he was very nice, but wasn't able to find the item we needed.

This is NOT a 'run in, grab what you need, get out' type of store. You need to dedicate a good few hours of your day.

There is also a line to return or exchange.

Not the shopping experience I will be running back to in the near future.<//text></record>

<Text>They're doing their best right now with the new social distancing and implementation of COVID protocols, however this only delays the already long experience of an Ikea trip. Prepare for queuing like you're are at an amusement park in long twisting lines, minus the rides, and the only roller coaster you'll find here is an emotional one... just to enter the store. There's a queue at the entrance and a separate queue for returns. Idk who needs to hear this but be prepared to exercise extreme patience during your next trip here.. oh and FYI ---  THEY STOP ACCEPTING RETURNS AT 7PM!<//Text><Name>Tina Z</Name>< Response>

Warning online stock and product availability is inaccurate. I drove 1 hour, waited in line for almost 2 hours, the online site showed 24 items in stock. I go in nothing on the shelf!! Website still showed 24 items in stock with last updated date and time when I was at the store. You cannot even talk to someone on the phone to double check product availability, all they do is refer you to the website which is inaccurate!< /text>

I forget how long it takes every time I go, even just checking out takes around ten minutes because lines can be really long but the selection and showroom here are really big! The only thing thats really rough is returns - plan to come at a time that isn't busy because there is usually a 30 plus minute wait to return. I furnished my apartment with almost all Ikea (photo below)!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Idk why I keep going here. Everytime I leave disappointed. The store layout is intentionally a maze forcing you to walk through every department when you really just want to look at the sofas. I remember that they used to have good prices considering the quality but the prices today are just as high as a mid tier furniture store but with low tier prices. You can find comparable quality at Walmart for half the price and far greater quality at Ashley's for the same price.  It's good for inspiration and wasting 3 hours for an ice cream cone.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

In the era of a pandemic, it was well managed in terms of customer intake.  However once inside it was just as crowded as pre-pandemic.  Ikea staff did a good job of monitoring people to ensure mask protocols were adhered to.<//text>

This was our first look into Ikea and we were in love. I guess it can be said that we are really adulting. After hours of walking, dinner time came in and we ate at the café. Got the chicken tenders with fries, (which is now a standard order for our family) and the Swedish meatballs (which my dad even got extra to cook at home). My mama and I love the conspiracy cake. I feel like that is the real chocolate cake. I feel so guilty eating it but it's that good. I always get the free coffee one when you sign up for the family member every time you go in.<//text>

< Review>
Their Covid precautions are very good, and the employees are not shy about telling people to put their mask on properly,  which I appreciate.

The only problem is the parking, I am disabled and usually park in the handicapped spots, but we had to bring a uhaul truck to bring stuff home and they made us park REALLY far away and it was hard walking that far to the store.

It was made worse by a male employee admonishing me for bringing a cart from the parking lot when they had carts inside the store,  my husband told the man repeatedly that I needed the cart to help me walk and the employee just kept telling me I should have gotten a cart inside,  he was very rude and quite the bully.

He just doesn't care if people need assistance, he just went on and on about the cart

I  won't be going back until they can accommodate disabled people in moving trucks, it's too far to walk and who needs abusive employees complaining about a cart Ineed to walk that distance?</Review>

< Review>
Huge selection of furniture in an easy to find layout.  The showrooms and cafe are on the second floor while the small products and actual furniture is on the first floor.  There are tons of associates around to help you find things. The cafe is great and well stocked.  Parking is ample and easy to locate. People actually abide by the loading zone parking.< /Review>

<Text>I've bought furniture here for years. Prices are usually good, quality is generally fine. I don't mind assembling things myself. It's always been busy everytime I've shopped here. But in this new post covid-19 world things are much worse.

I arrived 10 minutes before they opened on a Thursday. There were hundreds of people waiting in line to get in, and the sign said it was a 40 minute wait to get in. So, I gave up and went home. I'll just shop online.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I have never been into an IKEA, but have been to many furniture stores! I'm amazed and love their stuff. We came here looking for items that my daughter would be able to use in her dorm room at UCSB. We found a small night stand that fits on top of her fridge, a small dresser to use for storage and as a TV stand, things to organize her closet, a cousion for her desk chair and even a futon that fits between her and her roommates bed!  The quality is awesome and simple to put together. Love it!

I am 100% a fan and we will be back when we upgrade rooms at home! We had no issues, customer service was fantastic and we will be back!< /Review>< Pictures>

When this store first opened, there were lines going down the block. This is a very large store that is very popular. There is a food court here that is very reasonable and quality of food is good and fairly inexpensive. I like looking at the different setups to give us ideas on how to decorate our home.< /text>

Though people don't adhere to the keep moving signs, the ikea staff do a good job  of keeping the lines going and keeping track of a count on the store.</Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>I’ve gone to Ikea Burbank during this pandemic more than once, where I saw things like making a wheelchair bound person wait in line, trailing through the parking lot in the heat. Previously I had been able to say I had a disability placard, and was allowed to skip the line. Today I watched as they decided on a case by case basis whether the placard was enough. It was offensive as getting a placard alone required visits and documentation. They are picking and choosing which disabilities are valid which I feel violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told this is compliant.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Go for the items you need in your house, stay for the food court! They also have a place you can keep your kids busy so you will be able to enjoy all that Ikea offers. Sometimes you need to be inspired by the creative home designs without having to watch your kids. Ikea has the place for you. Now you only get 1 hour, so make the most of it. Stroll through the labyrinth or find some new shortcuts. Have fun enjoy the time. Also stop by the food court for a sit down meal with a free coffee or tea for Ikea family members (sign up, it's free and worht the coffee). If you missed that, then grab a quick bite from the grab and go section by the registers. Most importantly, have fun!<//text>

You get what you pay for.  Ikea has cheap furniture and that's great if it's what you're looking for.  But trust me, the food is not good. The only thing remotely tasty was a cauliflower and broccoli cake.  That's sad!  Skip the restaurant and have a hot dog on the way out.</Review>

<text>We love IKEA. Burbank is usually the most convenient location when we travel to or through LA. I would really prefer that we could place an online order and pick it up at the Bakersfield warehouse. That's where our stuff gets shipped from, so I know that Terry are set up to pick individual orders. Shipping for the big stuff is usually not worth it. I do like the convenience of click and ship. The employees have always been fantastic when I've had questions or needed other help.< /text>< response>

Our foodie group ate at the cafe within IKEA. it was fairly inexpensive.  I think everyone in our group was satisfied with their lunches. I had a pork shank, served with mashed potatoes, pickled red cabbage/beets, and a nice salad. The food was enjoyed by all of us!<//review>

<review>Huge selection of furniture in an easy to find layout.  The showrooms and cafe are on the second floor while the small products and actual furniture is on the first floor.  There are tons of associates around to help you find things. The cafe is great and well stocked.  Parking is ample and easy to locate. People actually abide by the loading zone parking.< /review><pictures>None</pictures></record>

<Review>I buy big items online for a home delivery. Building it is a team of two.
To return items is easy with taking them to the store (365 days to return)giving you store credit (same day) or debit/credit (1 week)
Examples of Ikea furniture:
Baby crib
Bunk bed< /Review>< pictures>

Though people don't adhere to the keep moving signs, the ikea staff do a good job  of keeping the lines going and keeping track of a count on the store.</Review>

The worst place to go during COVID. And the website isn’t any better. You park in the structure and then are made to walk miles before you reach the line which is another mile long of waiting. Don’t come here.</text>

<Review>Due to Covid you have to wait in line to go into the store. The wait time is over an hour.  They have placed tarps to offer shade, but in the middle of summer it's too hot and too many people. Not worth waiting for over an hour to get it.<//Review>< Response>

<Time>1498829960808</Time><Rating>4</Rating><Text>This massive home furnishings store was packed with drool-worthy rooms fully furnished and decorated. Prices are fantastic as is the selection.

The ordering/shopping process was a bit confusing for first-timers and scanning from the app didn't work for us. Staff was friendly, but not particularly helpful to those that didn't understand the process.

Delivery options are very nice with fair pricing, but get ready to spend several hours putting your furniture together when it arrives.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkUx0rPltr_3uNo9opbR09UEyqmfWIwWvL4T5g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

Love everything about IKEA including the food. The pizza reminds me of my childhood school lunch, the veggie dogs are delish (hold the mustard) and the cafeteria food is pretty good. Price is not so bad, but I had an unpleasant experience with a female server. Not sure if she was having a bad day or what but if customer service or serving people is not your thing you're only making your employer look bad<//Review>

During this Corona time, outdoor parking is all blocked with cones.
You will most likely be waiting outside. On a Saturday, it was up to 30min on average. They have shades however.

I’ve gone to Ikea Burbank during this pandemic more than once, where I saw things like making a wheelchair bound person wait in line, trailing through the parking lot in the heat. Previously I had been able to say I had a disability placard, and was allowed to skip the line. Today I watched as they decided on a case by case basis whether the placard was enough. It was offensive as getting a placard alone required visits and documentation. They are picking and choosing which disabilities are valid which I feel violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told this is compliant.</Text>

<review>Incredible waste of time. Company so bad as line into store was at far end of parking lot (2 miles from your car) and line itself had no water or hand sanitizer and in some cases no cover). Actually while concept of having to walk through whole store and then find your item in a bin is stupid.</review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Boy, that place is big.  Before you go in, make sure you have an idea of what you are going to buy as there are so many great items in this store.  And also I noticed that they improved on their tables, used to be so flimsy, now the support are solid metals. Enjoy shopping.  Oh yeah, love their meatballs from the on site restaurant.😁</text>

Great specialist for renovation of your kitchen. Beautiful high quality cabinets, appliances. They will create the whole new kitchen for you free of charge and will deliver. Also lots of good quality furniture / knock off Italian designs/, and you can buy whole rooms - for people without imagination!😁<//text>

<Review>Excelent prices!
But it seems like once you are inside, you are on your own. If lucky, you'll stomp upon a sales representative, If not, g

< Review>
Love shopping at all while sale stores, IKEA is one of them.

Common it's IKEA, who wouldn't like it. You go in for fun and come with $100 bill easy.

This time around I tried the Vegan Hot Dog. It was not bad.< /Review>

Literally standing in line for over 2 hours now,half of it in the sun waiting to return. Was advised they have only 3 people working on returns as it's not their priority. Great customer service thanks.<//Review>

We normally go for high end furniture and accessories but we took an afternoon and went to Ikea! We found a wonderful place.</Text>

IKEA is a great place to hang out with friends, get a bite to eat, and of course buy furniture. IKEA is notorious for their amazing food, and lives up to my expectations. It's a very open spot and I would go again.<//text>

<Text>Terribly long lines & most furniture items are still out of stock!

60 minutes plus waiting time in line just to return items (outside in the heat).

15 minutes in line to check out at cashier

30 minutes plus waiting time AFTER checking out just for the line to take the elevator down to the parking deck (again, outside in the heat)!

Incredible waste of time!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I love walking through the fake apartments and pretending like I have my life together.
Other than that, great prices and never had a problem with staff. Pretty standard for Ikea.<//Review>

<time>1579406929709< /time><text>Overall not a bad experience, but very disappointed that one of the main items we came to buy, which the Ikea website (and even the in-store computers) said was in stock, was actually out of stock. Now we have to either waste another half a day to come back to the store some other day - and who knows if next time the "in stock" status would be believable - or buy it online and pay shipping AND wait a several days to receive it (we were planning to use it right away, so this is a big inconvenience).< /text><gmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a<//gmapID><rating>2< /rating>< user_id>

<Text>Make sure you join their rewards program. They usually send you a welcome email with $20 off $150.

Also periodic deals in their cafeteria.

Lots of great ideas for decorating your place.

The curtains are a good deal and installation was easy<//Text><gmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a< /gmapID>< name>

During the COVID-19, prepare to spend at least an hour outside before you can get in. Drinking water fountains are disabled. The entire store looks and feels like a ghost town.<//text>

Hours stated they were open until 9.   I got there at 7:45 only to be turned away at entrance because they were closing early.  I understand times are tough, but not even a sign before entering the lot.  They waited for us to park walk on down and were told too bad.<//Review>

<review>Having just visited Lowe’s and realizing that I’m not a viable consumer,  I was discouraged at having to put in a kitchen.  IKEA came in to the rescue.  They make you feel like it’s okay to be in the working class lol.  Especially their kitchen offerings.  You have to support companies like this when they can come in and protect you against the pitfalls of capitalism—GREED.  They probably deserve your hard earn dollars.  Imagine a company that charges you a fair price and doesn’t gauge the consumer.  Imagine!!<//review>< Pictures>

I always enjoy a trip to IKEA. The new Burbank IKEA is pretty nice. I like that we don't have to get our parked car and drive it to the loading area to put our larger purchases in. Now we can cart it to our car!
The store seemed clean and very busy. We found our items quickly in the warehouse area because hubby made his shopping list online before leaving. The list included the aisle and bin numbers.
It did look like they should hire a few extra people for the cafeteria and cafe. They were barely keeping up when we're there. The self-serve drink area in the cafe needed more lids and some clean up.<//text>

<response>None< /response><text>Way too confusing for someone who knows what they want and just wants to price shop around. Their business model doesn't appeal to me. Other furniture stores like Ashley's Or Bob's are much easier & quicker to navigate. But if you don't mind blowing a whole day or night here then it might be a five-star experience. Otherwise, the best thing this place has going for them are the .99 cent dark chocolate bars.</text>< pics>

<Review>START the CAR! Best home item deals around. Always the answer to my home needs. Lights, pots, chairs or French press. This place is the best.  Plenty of parking, food space to break up your shopping adventure. Always a tasty yogurt treat on the way out.  I gladly accept Ikea gift cards!<//Review>< Pics>

We drove 40 min to the store to exchange some items but because we arrived 2 min late Stephanie(manager)and Maria they didn’t let us in. They said they don’t care about the customer service and their closure time is consistent.</text>

<Text>Terrible location. Worst management. Utter disregard for customer experience, time, money. Literally by far the single worst ikea location I have EVER been to. I recommend going literally anyplace else. Save yourself the pain a frustration of this HORRIBLE place.</Text>< user_id>

<Review>At first they can be very confusing to navigate yourself through IKEA. But what do you expect this place is pretty much your house in different rooms. They help you navigate all throughout the store and you can even have a bite while your family decide how to spend your money. I would recommend this place if you’re a first time buyer for furniture or anything You really need for your house.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>IKEA is always fun, going into the rooms and imagining what it would be like to live there. The food is generally decent, and who can say no to a free cup of tea just by showing your membership number? By the time you've covered the top floor it's good to have a bit of a rest.
And that's the one issue, there's so much to see, it's pretty tiring by the time you get to the market place. Then you have a whole floor still to go. And you don't want to miss any of the useful gadgets tucked away in the corners.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I buy big items online for a home delivery. Building it is a team of two.
To return items is easy with taking them to the store (365 days to return)giving you store credit (same day) or debit/credit (1 week)
Examples of Ikea furniture:
Baby crib
Bunk bed</review>< Pictures>

This is an amazing place with amazing prices for all the essentials and extras for your home. Practically accomodating any budget as Ikea has an abundance of options. Love coming here and they even have a cafe with good selection of food. Definitely a must stop when shopping for furniture and any necessity to make your home feel that much more comfy<//Review>

Apart from being a generic IKEA, parking here is impossible to find. If you're looking to buy plants, this is one of the worst maintenance of plants I've ever seen. One other thing I absolutely hated was that i couldn't get a signal on my phone in the store to research the plant I was buying and the WiFi is paid.</text>

<text>This is a new location that replaced a previous warehouse that was a little ways away. Much better lay out and a far greater selection in each category. The inly real pain is the parking situation which is definitely lacking in efficiency and ease. Over all a good spot to find what you need when it comes to furniture as well as food for that matter.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< userid>

Just fyi. Arrived on Friday around 7 pm and the wait to get inside the store is 1.5-2 hours!!
Try to shop at non-peak times if you can

Wait times are consistently at least ONE HOUR. I've gone a few times at different times of the day and week. I also asked an ikea worker and they said there is always a line.

They will not let you into the store if you arrive after 730 pm.

There is a separate line for returns- you must have your receipt<//Review>

<Review>Store Hours listed are misleading. Although the store closes at 9pm, the returns area is closed at 6pm and the entrance is closed at 7:30. Store hours should possibly be adjusted to reflect when the entrance is closed.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

At this rate it would take over 8 hours to get to front of line. Standing in sun for an hour was extremely unacceptable and uncomfortable. Didn't get to do my return because I don't have hours of time to stand in line. The check-in app says 40 minute wait time. It said that for over an hour. That app is incorrect. I will never shop here again. Zero stars!< /Review>< gmap_id>

I can’t say enough good things about Jorge! I was having trouble fitting a large mirror into my car and I thought I would have to return it. One of the managers called over Jorge who was quick and eager to lend a helping hand. (Note that this was after closing at 9pm on a Saturday night) Jorge went above and beyond my expectations. With a little twine, cardboard and a couple of bungee cords, Jorge was able to get the mirror secure into my car and sent me on my way with a smile on his face. This guy needs a raise or a promotion! Jorge, Thanks again for all your help and for being a positive, vibrant energy!< /Review>

I don't know who planned the Cov-19 outdoor line but it is done in a SPIRAL form. With all that space is Not very smart because constantly you'll find yourself less than 6 ft and very close to someone in the line that is behind or ahead of you. I think the line to get in is worst than being inside. I'll change my review when they change the Covid-19 spiral form line. It should be straight line.<//Review>

Ikea is a fun place to visit. The labyrinth it sends you through is a calming experience and it actually makes shopping for furniture and housewares fun. I personally love coming here not just for that experience but that of the cafeteria as well. Good food. Food furnishings. GOOD TIMES!</text>

Huge place be ready to get your steps in for this store. There really isnt any help available but can do all your shopping in one stop at good deals. Get the drill ready because the furniture requires lots of assembly.</text>

Be prepared for a circuitous route.  You wander all over the store before you find the exit.  I logged 2 miles on this visit.  Prices are reasonable and the selection and quality are good.  You do have to assemble what you buy so take your time, make a day of it.< /Text>

<Text>This store is making it difficult for customers to return and exchange stuff, by closing returns 2 hours(7:00 PM) before store closes(9:00PM)  and this information is hidden in  their website.
They are very irresponsible and don’t care to inform their customers about the changes in their store timing .<//Text>< pics>

Shopping interesting, please read carefully because all parts and pieces do not come in the product! Extra this, extra that plus more $'s, money?? Tried to have lunch in the cafeteria, not fresh, to much freezer burn. They offered on the menu only what you could purchase as frozen food from IKEA! Not good..< /Review>

Good selections for a fair price. Much better now they've extended the hours. Takes a while to get on the elevator to take your bulky items to your car but it's well organized.< /review>

< Review>
Decided to stop here on my way back from Downtown LA to grab a bite to eat. I heard they had some great vegan options and they didn't disappoint. Tried the veggie balls upstairs which were good. But the veggie dog downstairs was the best. Also got some icees (since the frozen yogurt isn't plant based yet) for the kids and the oat smoothies for myself and the hubby. Kids loved loved the icees and the oat smoothies are awesome! The boxed ginger Kafferep cookies we got were also good!<//Review>

<text>All items at one place. Furniture are beyond your imaginations. Quality is very good. Price is very dry reasonable.

Cafeteria is too good. The children’s play area is also very useful. It helps us with a hustle free shopping. Restrooms are neat and tidy.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

After years of shopping at the previous location of IKEA I decided to explore the BIGGER-n-BETTER Ikea and WOW!! This is like a dream come true for all types of shoppers — #DIY #BargainHunter #Sales #CollegeStudent #Designer #Creative #Artist
I took a stroll through the showrooms and found endless ideas popping into my head! From the smallest must-need items like kitchen hand towels to elaborate chandeliers, you’ll definitely find what your looking for in this amazing warehouse of useful home decor!
I fell in love with Ikea’s creative window shades, room dividers, bedroom sets and did I mention the art?!! You wouldn’t expect Ikea to come out with mural sized New York City skylines or old world maps to make any wall POP out as a focal piece in your home, but they do!
Trust me when I say, the new IKEA Store is like a tourist attraction for Southern California!
Definitely a Must-Do on anyone’s bucket list 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</Text>

Best place ever! Honestly Ikea is my happy place and apparently this location is the largest in the world? Or maybe the country? But either way, very impressive. They have everything; inspiration books, furniture, mattresses, kitchenware, decor, groceries, and the best of all... MEATBALLS, vegan, beef, and chicken. So there's a meatball for everyone!< /Review>

While the massive layout can be confusing at times, it makes sense if you pay attention to the clearly visible signs. Also, the food isn't bad for on the go energy. All around a pretty good place for everything you need for big projects and small.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Swedish meatballs for $5, infinite Tapatio packets, $1 generic soda, and free WiFi!? This place is first date material.

Also big ups to Ikea for adding small sheets of metal between the holes in the men's stalls. I appreciate the extra privacy that I get when I'm doing my business. 👌< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>A HUGE Warehouse with LOTS of things for your house at different price points. From Furniture to Housewares. Most Furniture needs to be assembled yourself. They do offer assembly at an additional cost. It has a Cafeteria upstairs with delicious food. The Chicken Tenders are my family's favorite. They also have a small restaurant downstairs that sells hot dogs, pizza, cinnamon rolls,  slushies, sodas, and ice cream.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Always friendly service. Low prices and nicely designed items. Best time to go is 30 minutes before closing on a weeknight. No crowds, fast checkout lines, lots of parking. But if you like to look around at every department, go one to two hours before closing... Otherwise you won't have time to see everything!<//text>

I think it's the biggest IKEA in the country. Easy in and out if you know what you are looking for. Watch all the consumer zombies and their karts. Meatballs are bomb.<//Review>

<Review>IKEA

I love this store in Burbank CA. I love to follow the meandering walkways. I get the excitement I got when I was a little girl. When  I walked threw my first ever, Fun Park Maze. Same feel,  but now I get some great stuff!
About 4 years ago I got the Soderhamn sectional in turquoise and it’s just as beautiful as the first day I bought it... Really! As long as I keep the skeleton of my couches in good condition, I can always change the fabric for another color. IKEA makes my life easier because everything goes with everything. You can’t go wrong!

I’m forever evolving with many of IKEA’s products, easily making my home function with timeless style.

Thanks IKEA,

Today's visit was pretty good although the new store is extremely confusing and overwhelming I used to be able to find everything with no problem but not today I went around in circles and circles the second time I came in I had to go twice today because I had to come back with an empty car to pick up the things that I put on hold from a clearance center I must say I did quite well they had some great bargains I always hit the clearance center first the only issue I had was at checkout when I asked for help and I was told somebody would be out at the loading dock and they were not I had to leave my car open my merchandise curbside and run in and get somebody to help me other than that everybody was extremely helpful and kind I just have to get used to the new store<//text>

Floors of parking and multiple entrances to parking. Came on a weekday in the late morning and barely anyone was there. I love getting their cheap breakfast, but they only serve it from opening to 11am. Everything is kid friendly, from the restaurant to the bathrooms. There's so much you can buy here to solve those little issues at home as well. I love IKEA in general, but I really do love this humongous location.<//Text>< Pics>

Layout of the store is very involving and always changing. They set up MANY small and big rooms as examples with real life scenarios... a pillow strewn about... a pile of books beside the sofa... a sofa throw arranged in a not-so-arranged aka NORMAL way.. and lots more. Point is.. you will not have any problems imagining yourself in a room of your liking.

the marketplace is a haven for those that want to mix and match according to their tastes. Be is cutlery, napkins, tableware, fabrics, furnishings... Ikea has multiple things in all price points. Try the store for an immmersive experiece.< /Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><rate>3< /rate><review>Ikea isn't what it used to be. They've gotten rid of half the sales force, so it's difficult to find assistance (an employee confirmed that, when asked). There's no bargains, just a massive amount of junk. There are still a few good purchase to be made, hand towels and plant pots - even those items can be purchased elsewhere, better quality and price. Worse, every time I go, someone comments about how different it is in Europe - they say there, customers get good service and quality products. I find it so annoying that it's ok to offer Americans cut-rate everything. Ikea used to be a model of quality Swedish service and products.  Now, it's a gigantic Dollar Store with grumpy service, when you can find it... That was the last time I'll go there till it improves. If everyone would stop going, they would be forced to improve.

<review>Surprisingly a really good selection. But then again what else would you expect from the biggest IKEA in the USA. I wouldn't recommend the cafeteria food court to eat I'd rather have the pizza or hotdogs that are half the price by the registers near  the exit. All and all good shopping great prices. Having the IKEA app on your phone is a must here.</review>< Pictures>

Yikes, stopped to shop and had cafeteria dinner on par with a restaurant but low priced. They moved to a brand new but tricky to find location not updated on Google maps.

Arrived Sunday July 19th, 7:45 PM. Outside lines looked much like Disneyland prior to the current deadly Pandemic! Lines of 150 to 200 people were directed with metal barriers which were strung out which turned back the other way which placed people next to each other. Customers coming one way were NEXT to those going the other way. The pictures briefly taken before I abandoned my visit show lines 2 people deep due to the lighting. Actually the lines were about 4 to five people deep. As I left noticed there was about a 10 mile an hour wind which clearly exposed patrons to even more exposure.

Quite a hotbed of possible and probable  exposure. Certainly not the time due to pitiful planning to place people at risk of a deadly disease.< /text>

<Review>Know what you are looking for and wear comfortable shoes if you want to browse.  Staff was plentiful and helpful on a week day visit. Store layout is purposely designed to force you to shop the whole store.  It's been awhile since I have been to IKEA and my sense is the prices are not as good as they used to be. There was lots of parking and activities for children.<//Review>< Date>

<Review>Took part in the bed making game. They judged strictly by time and not by execution. That girl clearly shouldn't have won she put the pillows in the wrong cases and never put the duvet thing in it's case. The last stranger performed like a hotel employee and only took about a minute more. She was snubbed. Snubbed.

After confirming via their website that they close early during covid but we’d make it in time, we drove up from San Diego.

To discover they refuse to let people in even earlier than their already early closing.

The early closing hours they advertise are irrelevant as they refuse you entry even if you’ve made it on time.<//review>

They also have fresh coffee and sparkling water in a variety of flavors. It's a pretty decent place that's always clean.< /Review>< user_name>

<review>IKEA always has great prices on hundreds of house hold items. I'm glad there is plenty of parking and a hand full of staff. You can be sure that your trip to this giant superstore would be a pleasant one.<//review>< date>

The new-ish Ikea in Burbank - parking is much improved, as is road access. The restaurant is good, with lots of windows. The checkout is still a zoo, and it would be great if it were easier to buy the food before checking out with everything else.< /review>

All to ensure you'll stay at least half a day here if not longer. No matter how spacious the store is, you'll be miserable during holidays and weekends. Make your way here during normal business hours and you might just find yourself wandering the corridors for hours.<//Review><user_id>116060233480693286110</user_id></record>

I Bought furniture at this store for $5935, paid $89 for the next day delivery. Now is the third day and I still haven’t furniture in my apartment. Called them a day before to resolution department got the resolution case number, supervisor of resolution department was assured that the delivery will be the next day. In the result when i called them again the operator told no delivery for today and it will be in a couple days on Thursday... it’s the “Best customer service” I ever had.</text>

The customer service in the store was superb! But when I filled out the form to have my new items delivered to my home address, the woman typing in the information wrote down the wrong address and delivered it to another person! I had to call IKEA Customer Service four times to get this corrected, and each time, they hung up on me. Eventually the man delivering the items called my cell phone and asked for an updated address and promised the items to be delivered before noon. They still haven't arrived.

TL;DR: The store was great, but they screwed up the shipping information and delivered my items to another person nowhere NEAR where I was.< /Text>

The parking lot is so large. Variants of products vary and cover almost everything you need. However, delivery is too expensive. They should consider a later delivery with more affordable cost.
Oops, haven't mentioned the foodcourt. It's so tasty and good price. IKEA Members get coffee or tea for free.< /Review>

Great if you like to spend your whole day shopping, which I despise. If shopping is an adventure for you, this is the place! If it's a chore, this makes it even more so.</Review>

This isn’t just a place to shop. It’s an entire experience. I went with a group of friends and we had so much fun. The prices are great. My friend developed a project for her store online and we used that tool to shop. We were able to give her store a very professional look using the items from IKEA. I couldn’t help buying things either and now have my own projects.

I also had coffee and Cinnabons in the morning and Swedish meatballs for lunch. I can’t wait to go back!< /text>

<Review>This Ikea is massive. Their inventory is what you would expect from any Ikea, inexpensive, high variety, and incredibly chic. The showrooms are laid out beautifully.

I waited in line yesterday for about an hour, and asked for a white marble effect EKBacken kitchen counter top, but instead, I have been sent a grey concrete effect EKBacken countertop, and when I tried to call back, apparently they are too busy to answer my call.<//text>

Always a cool place with some cool home furnishings and amenities of any and all types. Great prices and a ton of seemingly happy couples everywhere... Can be a number if your single but hey, I went there for some cutlery and dishes and walked out with rugs, bedding and window dressings. I'm a weakling... Hold on to your wallets. lol< /text>

< review>
Edit: 7/23/2020, I went to IKEA again a few weekends ago and I can't remember waiting in a line that long at a store, club, concert, or amusement park in well over a decade. It was 98 degrees outside!!! How is it that I haven't been waiting in line at Costco, but I'm standing in a parking lot, snaking in and out of makeshift lanes under a huge tent, only to walk across the lot to ANOTHER line in ANOTHER tent?! You come up that stairway from the underground parking lot, see that line... and start making some serious life decisions. "What else was on my agenda today? Can that wait until next weekend?" The even have an official stand in the lot selling bottled water for $1.

C'mon IKEA. Get your "order online and pick up" feature up to the standards of other huge companies. It won't even let me click the button and been saying it has too many orders for the day, every day, for I don't know how long. Now, it's this line or bust. At least everyone is safe.

Positives: friendly staff, they had almost all the items I wanted in stock, and no line for checkout.

Past review (pre-corona): Grabbed a few home items today. They have very organized shelves/sections. One of the best places to get blackout curtains. Not too crowded during the day (went around 3 on a Friday afternoon). Very different on weekends. :)</review>

<user_name>Andres Portillo</user_name><review>Because this is the biggest Ikea in America it's understandable that the lines and wait would be long. This place has probably every single thing you would ever want. Do you want plants? They got it. Do you want a single wooden spoon that probably has magic powers? I wouldn't be surprised if they got it. I would come just for the experience.< /review></record>

How can you not love IKEA?  Great place to take a toddler to play and eat during the day.  It’s our alternative indoor playground in the children’s showroom.  I think I come to this IKEA like once a week.  When the weather sucks, it’s the best place to take a toddler who wants to run around.</review>

I used to buy a lot from IKEA, but have a feeling the lost it. The quality is just not the same anymore - it's cheap. And I do not have money or time for cheap things.

I bought to chairs - and an electric screwdriver. The screwdriver was not even strong enough to remotely assist assembling the chairs. I have up - and returned all three items.

While IKEA brags about their generous return policy - 365 days just sound to good to be true. But the truth is: I had to sand in line for more than an hour - take a number - and wait. We had nine in front of us. Four gave up - as staff was busy chatting among themselves. Mission accomplished - make them wait so long they give up.

I got my money back and since this was my fifth and final negative experience at IKEA USA, I vowed to never return.<//Text>

<text>I really love IKEA all around the world.
Personally I really like to buy all the small things and accessories to your house.
Not fan to buy a kitchen or a sofa but all other things like drawers, tables and small kitchen Ware is available all around in a very reasonable price.
Register for IKEA family card for additional discounts! Make sure to check the inventory you want to buy before heading out (on their website)< /text>< Pictures>

There is not particularly a LOT if variety, but they serve a wide enough choice of good, flavorful food (for a good price, mind you!) that almost everyone can find something that suits them.
...Or just meet up for coffee there.

We met there, ate & talked, then took our time to decide just where we wanted to go next.

<rating>3< /rating><text>Ikea market-maze in its own beauty. Once you got in you won't find the way out untill you'll go through all show rooms and market place. Great place to find cheap furniture though. But don't expect it to last more than a year. Also if you see something not cheap - don't expect it to has better quality than all other stuff. Be prepared for long queues. Also no much sense to use outside parking unless you like you car to be extremely hot 😉<//text>< pictures>

I really love IKEA all around the world.
Personally I really like to buy all the small things and accessories to your house.
Not fan to buy a kitchen or a sofa but all other things like drawers, tables and small kitchen Ware is available all around in a very reasonable price.
Register for IKEA family card for additional discounts! Make sure to check the inventory you want to buy before heading out (on their website)< /Review>

Always a cool place with some cool home furnishings and amenities of any and all types. Great prices and a ton of seemingly happy couples everywhere... Can be a number if your single but hey, I went there for some cutlery and dishes and walked out with rugs, bedding and window dressings. I'm a weakling... Hold on to your wallets. lol</Text>

<rating>4</rating><review>Really awesome place for practical and beautiful ways to decorate and furnish your home. Affordable for the most part. I love the calm atmosphere. The food court is a good place to take a brake from shopping and eat some food too. The food in my opinion is not the best though. They have a child care center so you can get your shopping done alone while the kids play. I have bought many things for my home there. And sometimes it is just nice to walk around and get ideas for home decor.</review>< time>

<review>I have been here twice and I will never come again.

It is a very crowded store that is shaped like a maze. Therevare few staff you assist you and they are always to busy to answer your questions. Most of the stuff they have can be found at walmart, target, and amazon for the same quality and a better price.

The food was good the first time and the second it gave me diarrhea. Eat at their cafeteria at your own risk.</review></record>

<Text>Man this place is weird. First you walk through and look at all this great stuff. But then you have to go look for the stuff again in a huge warehouse. I found this great table in the first part but in the warehouse all I saw was boxes. So I got a vanilla cone and some plastic cups and went home, but then I realized I didn’t have a table for the cups, so I threw them away. Thanks Obama.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Name>

<text>Ikea has some cool stuff, but if you have a return, be prepared to wait up to two hours!
Ridiculous. You thought Costco returns at Christmas were bad. And I’m talking the weekdays.
If you have less than 5 items and have your receipt, there is an express line, but if you are like me and lose receipts and rely on them looking up your account, than you are out of luck.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a</gmap_id><user>118006865192587924864<//user><rating>2</rating><Date>1560970741161</Date><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><user_name>Melanie Grijalva</user_name></record>

What is the point of this place? The building is an eyesore, for starters. It is like a giant LEGO was placed in Burbank. I went here for one thing and I still had to weave my way through a labyrinth to get to it.

The furniture quality is terrible and assembling it requires at least two people. This process will damage your relationships and your psyche, all for a piece of furniture you won't want to take with you when you move.</Review>

Great collection of house hold items and furnitures. All at reasonable prices. All items under one roof. Good quality stuff at affordable prices. A must place to visit if you are planning to furnish your home...< /review>

What can you say about Ikea? It's the Swedish Walmart. Like Walmart, sometimes you have to go there. If you do, this one is as good as any. Ample parking. Competent staff. Ikea stuff.< /text>

Looking to cool designs and layout for your new room/house? Well look no further. This place was HUGE (be prepared to walk), but IKEA is a really good place to start your room design for those who are into compact design and innovative furniture. They have sales year round (I personally enjoy), so it’s worth a trip if you’re close to the store.

Ultimately, a really nice place to start your blueprints or remodeling!< /text>

<review>First time going to Ikea and enjoyed walking around. Wish they would make it easier to get to the aisles where you purchase the large times. Other then that really recommend Ikea for a short or long shopping trip. They also have a restaurant where you can grab food after a long shopping trip very affordable food with a good amount of food. You can also plan to spend a while there lots to look at.<//review>< Resp>

First time at IKEA, and it was probably one of the best days of my life! This is the adult version of "a kid in a candy store." There was so much to see that I couldn't even get to all of it in one trip. I bought a table and chairs for my daycare, and will definitely need to come back to explore the rest of the store and all it has to offer. Only bad thing is I wish it was closer to where I live, but it's definitely worth the drive!<//Text>

The new Ikea is finally open.  The showrooms honestly don't feel any bigger.  The restaurant is way bigger though, it easily holds hundreds of people.  There are two lines for getting food too, so choose wisely, even though the food is the same.  There are multiple cashiers too, so the lines move faster.
The food options have increased a little from the old location.  You can get three different types of meatballs now and there are some new desserts too.
The coffee is no longer hand made, there are these super fancy automated machines instead, I wish they sold them at Ikea, because I'd buy one for sure.< /review>

Since they built the new IKEA all I have noticed is there more people going which equals longer lines and not clear enough signs for drivers. They is plenty of parking but everybody blocks all traffic in the front.  Signs needed for sure.  The other big thing I've experienced is less friendly and eager to help staff.< /review>

The store had a waiting period of 90mons just to get inside the store but the line was moving so we went in almost in an hour. It was my first tome going to Ikea so it took me a long time to find what I needed.
There were markings outsode to keep people 6 ft apart BUT it was crowded inside. What was the point on markings outside the store and not inside?</review>

Awesome store, parking is hard and is very busy on Saturday afternoon.  Plan for 4hrs plus to see everything.  Look at the website first and map out a plan.  Very overwhelming.<//text>

Disneyland for adults. This place is amazing, from the parking lot, that's right my 5 star review includes the parking lot, the lanes are so roomy and the isle of human traffic cones kindly pointing you to the perfect parking spot. Once you make it into the actual kingdom you are greeted and handed a large yellow bag ( always accept one ) and then before you even begin to start shopping you have a chance to ditch the kids! That's right they take your children and watch over them for free, the rest is just a vacation, the show rooms are well put together and the check out is fast and easy. And the restaurant they have inside is far better than some of the food choices around the area plus extremely cheap. ALWAYS FOLLOW THE ARROWS ON THE FLOOR.< /review>

<Review>What is the point of this place? The building is an eyesore, for starters. It is like a giant LEGO was placed in Burbank. I went here for one thing and I still had to weave my way through a labyrinth to get to it.

The furniture quality is terrible and assembling it requires at least two people. This process will damage your relationships and your psyche, all for a piece of furniture you won't want to take with you when you move.</Review><Name>Ruth B.< /Name><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

<text>Great items and prices for organizing your home. I have found fabric boxes, plastic containers which helps in my task to organize my home. So many colors to choose from and when they are on sale a 6 pack of beautiful boxes to organize socks, shirts, pants and undies for 3.99. That is a steal. Besides organizing items I like the bath mats. I have had several that have lasted for 4 years. They hold up to the weekly  washes.< /text>< pics>

What can I say this restuarant has a very reasonable price with extremely good quality of food. The service is always good whenever I go. If you have an IKEA family card on you your regular cup of coffee is free. They do have breakfast which starts at 9:30am and it is served up until 11am. The restaurant is closed at 8:30pm so make sure to check this place out. It has breakfast for a dollar or more depends on what you get. I get the two dollar plate which is Swedish pancakes, eggs, potatoes, and bacon. Its definitely a good choice in breakfast and the price is better than McDonald's. So do yourself a favor and come right in and enjoy a good meal that won't hurt that wallet of yours. Customer satisfaction 100%<//Review>

<Review>Ikea is a great place to buy low cost, clever, put-it-together-yourself furniture. But the showroom is a great place to while away the afternoon with a friend or even a date. While you walk through a maze from one section to the next you'll see dozens of fully realized rooms, each with its own mood, each set like a conversation pit. It's fun to go from room to room and when you get hungry there's a cafeteria offering low cost Swedish delicacies. A unique shopping experience.<//Review><Response>None< /Response><Date>1558569039194< /Date>< rate>

< Review>
Cheap furniture, rude and dismissive employees. Clearly you get what you pay for.
When I bought my kitchen there in the 90's the main selling point was that I could change the cabinet doors when they wore out. Then they changed all of the dimensions. The kitchen lasted 10 years before the cabinets wore out. Super cheap.</Review>

<text>Huge new location, only spent 3 hours walking and perusing all items on the floor, didn't have a chance to visit the restaurant, managed to grab the cookies which were heavenly. What's not to like about Ikea? They really have good solutions and give good inspirations, especially on their kitchen. Definitely can't beat their prices.

Thank you Ikea for the birthday gifts!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a</Gmap_id>< resp>

First time going to Ikea and enjoyed walking around. Wish they would make it easier to get to the aisles where you purchase the large times. Other then that really recommend Ikea for a short or long shopping trip. They also have a restaurant where you can grab food after a long shopping trip very affordable food with a good amount of food. You can also plan to spend a while there lots to look at.< /text>

Horrible customer experience! They discriminate you!!! Upper management needs to observe how employees behave with customers. The customer service manager “Jackie” is very rude and treat customers poorly. I felt harassed when I went to exchange something.< /Text>

This store is fun to walk through. I went there for a new red shoe horn. I was told they don't make them anymore. Oh well so I got an extra black one.< /Text>

Follow the paths.....there are 1000 paths...why can someone just tell you where it is!  No help available only follow the path.  It takes longer to find the right path then select your item...good selections, once you find them.  Prices are reasonable....but it's like a maze in there!< /Text>

Love organizational pieces and space saving furniture from here, their decor pieces are great too and you can't beat the prices, plenty of parking the restaurant and cafe are a big hit with folks. Can spend a day here looking for inspiration.<//review>

Ikea... this store was solely built to see if we can follow directions or if your friend with a truck is really a friend or not. Yeah we need a couch from time to time, but the Lingenberry jam is worth the trip itself. Check out some of the other foods in the downstairs market. Some really tasty smoked fish and cookies.<//text>

The worst service. I bought several big ticket items at this store over a month ago and I still don't have all the parts delivered to me. I've called them over 8 times trying to get the right parts and still waiting. Their phone customer service is the worst. If they are busy the automated system will just hang up on you and you will have to keep calling until you get someone. I was even refused by an online customer service rep. to talk to a manager/supervisor. I can assure you I will never order from Ikea again.</review>

As expected. After 45 mins of showrooms, we were finished. However, it's like Hotel CA, "you can check out any time you want but you can't ever leave".< /Review>

<Review>The largest Ikea in the North American continent 😎.
You can have a great way to shop here, with all possible furniture and models on display. More kind staff and more clean environment. It has the best large parking area. You can go around the store and will end up buying something.

Also it is not all about furniture but also the best food. I really love the for here. Healthy and good tasty food with a variety of options. The soups, the garlic breads, everything taste good. Cheaper too!

I recommend this place. Just visit this glory of vast furniture display!</Review><Rate>5< /Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Time>

It's easy to get lost here but they've got it all. Great prices but you sacrifice some quality. I'd do shopping here for some quick installs and furniture but nothing to be super proud of.</review>

It's SO big in here! This is the new store and it's even bigger than the old one. Like, lost inside here for hours big. The upside is that they have so much stuff to peruse you can really get some great ideas. Only downside is, if you do any actual looking at stuff, you had better plan to be there for at least 2 hours. Otherwise it's fantastic. The food at the cafe is even pretty damn good. Still love those Swedish meatballs!<//review>

You can spend the day here without noticing the time. Lots of designs to choose from. Cafeteria serves healthy food. Be a member and you get free coffee with free refills.
Lots of parking,  both shaded and open area.</Text>

<Review>Great store! I have never been to an IKEA before and it was amazing. But we were not quite prepared for the vastness of this store and spent the whole day wandering around. Very clean and the restaurant was excellent. But holy cow prepare yourself with snacks, extremely comfortable shoes/clothing, and be okay with large crowds because you will feel trapped there forever if you go.<//Review><name>Brianna G< /name><userid>117929597405467784918< /userid><Time>1534765020715< /Time>< Rating>

So i’ve been trapped in here for 18 years now. There is no exit and the employees are all deformed and very violent at night. The cafeteria meatballs are really good though! There seems to be no end. I can walk forever and never hit a wall. I could of sworn I walked past the same bookshelves 600 times.< /review>

This location is huuuuuge. They have tons of outdoor and garage parking but can still be a fight for a spot on the weekends. Their layout is straight forward but their shortcuts are harder to find than the old location. Since they have a bigger showroom and warehouse they have a lot of inventory too so there's a good chance they have what you need. Their food court is big too and two lines so they move people through pretty quick too.<//Text>

<Review>What can I say that hasn't already been said about IKEA. It's big. It's blue. It has a ton of home good options. The restaurant is better than it should be, and the small shop at the end offers a highly addictive candy selection. What's great about this new IKEA, is that even though it is enormous, it never feels to overwhelming. They've perfected the flow of the space, to where it all feels necessary, and it has a good rhythm. Parking is pretty easy as well. Maybe just avoid the weekends.</Review>< Pics>

The Service: Slow... wish there are more staffs behind the food counters and move the line faster. 2 cash registers only... waiting in line again. :(

The Food: OMG! Super cheap! The price is so affordable.

Soup, salad, bread - $1.99, $1.99 & $.39. Nothing special... Bread is tough & old.

Swedish meatball - addictive... can't stop eating them! They give you generous amount of meatball, cranberry sauce and mashed potato.

Salmon - the salmon is delicious, but the steam vegetable are way overcooked. The potato cake thing.... not a big fan.

The Parking: Parking structures across the street or parking structure behind the mall.<//review>

<Text>I love going to IKEA. The furniture is cheap so I don’t expect it to last forever, however it does last for the length of time that I need it and it is aesthetically pleasing. My only complaints are: the kitty collars are hard to find because they’re mixed with the dog collars, which means you have to sit down and dig through the box to find them; and they never seem to have enough check out lanes open to keep long lines down.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Honestly, this review is only for the veggie dog. It’s so good. It’s 75cents. It’s got beets and crispy onions and a touch of mustard and horseradish. It’s so good I would go back just for the veggie dog. Well done IKEA.

Store itself is ok, maze of furniture and tons of parking so no issues on arrival.

But that veggie dog...

I would add a photo but I ate them too fast.

<Text>As you'd expect, tons of options for everything in your home and all for an amazing price. It is all laid out in a decent way, but of course it can be hard sometimes to find things and occasionally you can find some hidden gems tucked away in different areas. I took off 1 star just because sometimes the items can be complicated to build or not of the highest quality, but usually it's all pretty good</Text>< time>

Nothing that i wanted was in stock. I drove 1hr and 15min then  I waited 2 hrs outside in line, didn't mind it. But after all that and not being able to buy what i needed was frustrating. Maybe they should put signs up of the stuff that runs out.< /text>

<Review>Busy place, pretty good food.    IKEA uses the restaurant to bait you into walking through the entire store.  If you plan to just eat and leave, be sure to take the elevator near the restaurant entrance back downstairs to make your exit.  Otherwise you will get stuck walking the entire store.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>I don't hate the experience of Ikea. It's a great place to see things before you order online. For me, I find the place overwhelming and too difficult to really choose an item. The example rooms are great, but it's too all over for me to focus on choosing the right furniture, rug, or style for my home.<//Text><user>103561930136812313748<//user><Time>1552799408856</Time>< GmapID>

The largest Ikea I've ever been to! It has a restaurant on the second floor, for when you need to recharge after the floor but before you shop. Get ready to spend 4-5 hours here!</Review>

Make sure to come EARLY, ideally just before 10am.
Have some breakfast there, if you have the Ikea Family Card (which you can get for free right there on the spot) they give you free coffee and some discounts in selected items.
After you buy the furniture, make sure to get some frozen meatballs, and a hot dog / ice cream to recover some energy. It can't be cheaper!<//Review>

One star just for the lack of customer care and service. Waited in line for 20 mins at the cafe to try one of their new veggie dogs just to get to the front and say that they are closing and dont want to cook more. No apologies or accommodations for a the long wait. Other than that we found what we needed minus the dogs. Lame customer service</Review>

Impressive! From the time we pulled in to their parking lot, there appeared to be a feeling from way back synonymous to driving into Disneyland. Well organized from the onset.

Well stocked and neatly organized with what appeared to be eco friendly home improvement products provided in abundance.

Comfortable and well lit, particularly appreciated the cool temperature within.

Great touch guys! Coming back for sure.

Thank you,< /Review>

What is there to say other than I try to limit my trips to Ikea because they have everything I would ever need for a house. Every single thing they have I find a necessity lol. Oh, and this new location is fantastic, plenty of parking spaces and easy access to pick up large furniture.< /Text>

<Text>Ikea is a good place for buying cheap furniture with high quality, which is a enterprise registered in Sweden. I like it that it has a children’ center and food center with healthy and nutritional food. I often take my daughter to the children’s center where the kids like to play and can play for one hour, then my wife and I walk around the store for seeking the furnitures that we want to buy. another good service that I value more is the return policy that you can return any item you don’t like within one year with no excuse.<//Text>< username>

<Text>Love love LOVE IKEA!!!!  Really love the new bigger store, easier loading area, etc.  Easy to find right off the 5 freeway.  Nice big cafe, pretty decent food for a great price!  Kids had a blast spending the day shopping for their new loft beds, and bedroom accessories.  Lots of stylish designs, fun colors, lighting fixtures,etc.  Kids were eager to shop!  Loved a couch that I intend to go back for in another month or so.  We used their delivery service too, they were great as well!  Only wish we had one in Santa Barbara, but it's definitely worth the drive for us to go to Burbank IKEA!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

< review>
IKEA has always delivered and have great price points for everyone to experience. It is all about thinking outside of the box for every individual. The showrooms certainly gives everyone the idea of how to put things together and certainly reasonably priced.

The new location is certainly bigger compared to the original location. The major difference to this location is the distance from Metro Bus Stops. It is a nice walk but it isn’t when there are customers who are older and/or handicapped. I share this review for how it has been hard for my mom. LA has been a car city but now there more people taking public transportation. It is one aspect of this location IKEA might have forgotten.< /review>

<text>Big place with lots of stuff to look at and lots more people to navigate around. Brand new and well designed from the ground up. I think it would be a lot easier and nicer to go during the the work week instead of the weekend. They have greatly improved their shipping policies. Lots of parking, although it may be a long walk back and forth to your car.</text>< Name>

I just love getting lost in IKEA, you always find even more stuff you weren't looking for. They didn't have the item I wanted in stock, even though they said they had two when I checked online, but found an even better option for furniture at half the price. Alot of the workers seemed like they hated being there, but luckily it's mainly self help anywho. Good view from the top parking lot!< /text>

<Text>Love the store. Its HUGE.. But try not to go on the weekend....when it is so packed, you wont be able to move. You will love the hige selection and the low prices on everything. Be sure to eat in the resturant for low priced, excellent food. Plenty of parking. My only complaint, a tiny one, is the checkout lines can be long. Park by the exit doors if you have big items to load up in your car.</Text><user>101690541802167668732<//user></record>

IKEA home furnishings gets a 10/10. They have not only home furnishings but lots of office supplies. There is a restuarant inside and a place for you to buy food stuffs. There are plenty of restrooms and water fountains inside. The place is easy to navigate. There us plenty of parking and it is free.</Review>

I will give a 4 ⭐ only b/c the line at checkout are insane. Had to wait for more than 45 min to purchase only ✌️ items, and even though their is only one line for "less then 🖐️ items" it was closed. It would be great if they had self-check out, or more lines open for people who are carrying only 🖐️ or less...< /review>

<Text>It is a labyrinth, to be sure. Great stuff but if you're only there for one thing you'll wish for a map. I really wish they had a GPS map I could use to find and follow my way around the store. Even a printed literal map would help. The posted diagram that resembles a circuit schematic is not especially helpful to me. I eventually found what I'd seen online and Friday night is a perfect shopping time because store is not crowded.< /Text><rating>4</rating>< name>

< Review>
I took my 94 year old dad to eat. When finished the elevator down was already shut down. I was told to take the stairs. ONLY PROBLEM IS MY DAD NEEDS TO USE A WALKER AND I A CANE. The alternative I was told was to drag ourselves through the labrynth of the world's largest IKEA. Who is in charge of the A.D.A accommodation department. I worked for 30 yrs at LACounty accommodating all our citizens this is an easy fix but a hardship for us.< /Review>

<review>welcome to the biggest Ikea in the country!!!  This place is massive Just wait to you see the place.  Seriously  plan on taking some time the first time you go and check out the lay out.  I just couldn't believe how huge this place is and how many people that work here and that are so helpful!!!   I love Ikea, I know many people  are closet Ikea lovers and it shows because they don't just build monstrosities like this if the numbers aren't there to back it!!  so Good for us and good for Ikea!!  Get some meatballs and shop to your hearts desire!!< /review>< name>

I'm pretty sure 99% of everybody has been or wants to go to IKEA. If you haven't you should definitely go. It's fun to walk through all the mock-up rooms throughout the upper level. Most of the shopping you will do is on the lower level and they have carts waiting when you get downstairs. My favorite section is the lighting area. Lots of cool designs and the prices are great.
There's only one alert I'd like to give you; if you parked on the lower level and need to take your cart downstairs sometimes they have the motorized ramp closed. If you don't have much you can just take it in your arms and go down the stairs but if you have a lot in your cart just turn around and you'll see elevators going down.
Have fun and happy shopping!<//Review>

It's massive, once I finished with the upstairs portion I thought I was gonna almost reach the warehouse where I pick up my items I desired, but it still took me like 10+ minutes of walking to find where that was. Plan your time accordingly</review>

It had a lot of good ideas for how to organize not just one room of the house,  but pretty much every single room of the house. Good prices were also what I saw a lot of as I walked through the perfectly organizedstore.  Not to mention nice and helpful working crew.  My time spent here was not wasted at all.<//Review>

Great for cool stuff, loading dock is horrendous, no staff monitors so people just pull up and go shop...supposed to be 15 minutes, one lady I observed brought two things out, put in her car and went back in, car is still there half hour later...spoke to employee who said they didn't have enough staff...not my problem but your 15 minutes is</text>

Huge, almost-new store, plenty of parking, good service and the always good minimalist simple Ikea design and quality, some stuff can last forever, other only a few months.
The famous restaurant has several delicious Swedish dishes, I personally enjoy their classic meatballs... also visit their mini food market to find something unique and tasty.</Text>

It's massive, once I finished with the upstairs portion I thought I was gonna almost reach the warehouse where I pick up my items I desired, but it still took me like 10+ minutes of walking to find where that was. Plan your time accordingly< /Review>

<pics>None</pics><text>The new Ikea is great. I ate a lovely breakfast with my family first (their prices are so incredibly low and the food is very tastey). Then we strolled around the showroom maze (which never gets tired) which took a couple hours. This place is extremely HUGE! Their stock is incredible. The prices for some things are questionable but other than that... a 5-star visit! 😍</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>One of my favorite places to shop furniture.
the new location is super easy to get to and from.
maybe the greatest thing about Ikea,   how the components can be re-invented and be whatever you imagine them to be.. like I just picked up a stockholm coffee table.. well turns out its a coffee table, all I see is a bench.. love my new bench :-)<//Text>< pictures>

This is by far one of the biggest Ikea I've ever been to. The selection is immense and you always end up buying something. The cafe also has a good selection of foods at a very low price. There is always plenty of parking regardless of what day or time to visit it. The associates are helpful and the in-store technology is on point.</text>

Same as any Ikea. Didn't feel more or less crowded than the others I've been to. Sleek extensive home furnishing made cheap. Assembly required or pay extra to have someone else do it. Great customer service.<//Text>

< Review>
Biggest Ikea I've ever been to. It's like an airport. Impressed how the whole layout works. You walk around the whole store with different sections of the house until you hit the end where that's where you get to pick the supplies that you were going to take and then checkout. Very impressed<//Review>

Awesome show room. Big store with lots of ideas. Friendly staff throughout. Good selection available. Store is nice and clean as well as the restrooms. Need more staff members around to help with the pick up /find your items area. It’s just a bunch of shelves with numbers every where. A little intimidating.< /Review>

I like IKEA to purchase handy stuff for home and office, however you do not lots of option, also I like the restaurant for brunch and dinner it serves fancy food that you can find only there( price is good), the thing that I do not purchase a lot in IKEA is that the material is not really good and in some cases I have been disappointed specially about wood cabinets. But you can get some ideas about your future home and find some thing nice.<//review>

Huge, clean, and has all of you needs for practically everything tho the workers are somewhat scarce when you need help. This IKEA is very organized and even has daycares to leave you children in while you shop! Highly recommend.<//Review>

<review>Different location (actually happened awhile ago, but first time visiting the new place)... Same I K E A.  Always enjoy browsing the upstairs furniture displays and often find useful household items among the downstairs self-serve area. Prices may creep up abit, but usually quite reasonable.  It's possible that since I'm familiar with the "IKEA experience" shopping here usually is quick and simple, but I see how it could possibly be a tad confusing (think finding the exit in a Vegas hotel) to new shoppers.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Personally, I have not met a person who does not enjoy IKEA. The show rooms have so much to offer. Different personalities are portrayed so it is very easy to find one that suits your vibe. I come here to find out what my house is missing. However, I linger around rooms to assign them to individual friends or family that would enjoy the layout and color scheme. I got some chocolate cake and I was not let down. Come to IKEA for a good time. (Not sponsored haha)<//Review>

I return an item that didn't work and I didn't have my receipt. They were nice enough to look at my credit card and they found the transaction in their computer from two months ago. They were able to put the money back into my credit card. Great job.<//text>

Pack a lunch...wait, not necessary as they have a full blown restaurant. You may want to consider taking PTO for a couple of days to get through all that's offered. I haven't been in years as there was no need, fir this visit either. Just wondering aimlessly around IKEA as if I'm at a theme park. THEY HAVE EVERYTHING shy of exercise equipment for your newly deigned room. I'm only dissappointed there was no IKEA mascot for visitors to  commemorate their visit. If you have several hours or a weekend to burn, this is the place for you. Great design ideas, reasonable prices, and all the people watching one can handle. Next time I'm going to tailgate in the parking lot.< /Review>

They limited entrance so there was an one hour waiting line on the open parking on 115 degrees. I couldn't take it. That's insane.<//Text>

I took my 94 year old dad to eat. When finished the elevator down was already shut down. I was told to take the stairs. ONLY PROBLEM IS MY DAD NEEDS TO USE A WALKER AND I A CANE. The alternative I was told was to drag ourselves through the labrynth of the world's largest IKEA. Who is in charge of the A.D.A accommodation department. I worked for 30 yrs at LACounty accommodating all our citizens this is an easy fix but a hardship for us.<//text>

Love the experience. Everything is clean, easy to follow, and it's great to see the display rooms to get an idea of what everything is and where to place them. Even grabbing food here is cheap and easy. Parking was plentiful and they had several parking attendants directing traffic in the lots, which was great< /Text>

Very Inspiring, lots of good ideas. Makes you want to take on projects and test your creativity. Not recommended for first dates however. Best advice is to not rush your visit here. They provide free child care and lockers while you shop. Staff is very friendly also. Just make sure you write down the item numbers exactly with paper and pencils provided.< /review>

This place is too huge! It is the larger one in The United States. It is pretty well organizrd. The restaurant is excellent but normally busy. There is plenty of parking underground so don't think you have to grab a spot upstairs. It is easy to navigate the store if you know what you want and don't want to spend 2 hours in the place<//Review>

I don't care what haters say, this is the best place to buy furniture. Good selection, good food, family oriented, huge lines to pay, good return policies. Nothing to complain about.</Review>

Different personalities are portrayed so it is very easy to find one that suits your vibe. I come here to find out what my house is missing. However, I linger around rooms to assign them to individual friends or family that would enjoy the layout and color scheme. I got some chocolate cake and I was not let down. Come to IKEA for a good time. (Not sponsored haha)< /text>< rating>

I like IKEA to purchase handy stuff for home and office, however you do not lots of option, also I like the restaurant for brunch and dinner it serves fancy food that you can find only there( price is good), the thing that I do not purchase a lot in IKEA is that the material is not really good and in some cases I have been disappointed specially about wood cabinets. But you can get some ideas about your future home and find some thing nice.< /review>

It sure was a pleasant shopping experience at IKEA, Burbank because everything I needed was there and easy to get. On top of great customer service there, there were very affordable prices and wonderful quality. I strongly recommend all of you to go (however, be considerate not to grab displays).< /Review>

Love Ikea, the food, the inspiration but it is so hard to get the attention of any of the sales, restaurant and cafe associates who are always deep in conversation with each other.  Still they are sweet when you finally let them finish their conversations.<//review>

Everything is cheap, quality is pretty good (considering you follow the instructions). Great food selection in the food court with free coffee/tea for members. Also they have an espresso/latte/cappuccino machine with unlimited refills for free with membership (also free to sign up).

What's not to like? Affordable, decent quality stuff with lots of ideas for decorating and home making. Definitely a must for new home owners on a budget. Also fun to just spend the day walking around hanging out.<//review>

Ikea is always overwhelming. There are so many people, so many things to look at, and so many good values. The day we weren't, they were killing it. When we asked for help, employees were ready and happy to assist. No one was pushy. The store was well maintained.</Review>

Huge, clean, and has all of you needs for practically everything tho the workers are somewhat scarce when you need help. This IKEA is very organized and even has daycares to leave you children in while you shop! Highly recommend.< /text>

Prices are always low, and variety of products are amazing.
I always seem to find myself lost in this store though. Not many employees hounding you to "help " you, which is great in my opinion because you have the freedom to actually shop around.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The pick up people were very friendly.  I will say that there were a lot of people hanging around and not getting my pick up item, forcing my guesstimated pick up time to 15 mins beyond. It was NOT crowded, so not sure what that was about<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Customer service was horrible. I couldn't find anyone to help me, the self-service item wasn't where it was listed and when I got in the customer service line I waited for 10 minutes, then when I checked out it took over 40 minutes for them to bring me my item while I watched people come and go. No apologies or niceties either, just after asking twice they brought me my order. I don't think I'll be shopping here again. What a time suck.<//Review>

Huge! Could literally spend hrs here. You know your an adult when you like spending time in a furniture place. Always love going to the quick service food area for the meatballs. An ikea trip isnt one, unless you get the meatballs. food is cheap, great prices on furniture and the staff is friendly. Just like target, i always buy more stuff then i need lol</Review>

Nightmare!!!

Better than average furniture...(for the price).

When it was SWEDISH it was exceptional (in its day,)

Now that it is Chinese, it is way below the wonderful things that you can get in China!

VERY understaffed!

(The salespeople are so nice, and try to be so helpful, that I feel that it is an act of human kindness not to ask them for help!)

The last time I was there, we put our names on a clipboard list, and we were #19!......

For obvious reasons, they cannot spend much time with each customer, but the are so nice, and so sweet, that you can almost overlook them glancing at the list with worried looks on their kind faces.

As an experiment, IKEA should double its staff...(for starters!)  Then add the same number of salespeople again!

THEN one could  concentrate on whatever the hell brought you there in the first place!

.......oh, the floors are so vast, that I suggested that they use "razor scooters", or small wheeled roller skates instead of "trekking"!

(They looked SO wistful, that I wish I hadn't said it!)</review>

Ikea a good spot to shop and get creative ideas, why should you visit ikea well if you want to remodel and just dont know what you want here is somewhere to start. Some of the furniture is awkward but hey the food is good and there's now a vegan option that a plus.<//Text>

This Ikea is massive but they accomplish all they've set out to do quite well. My favorite space is the cafeteria, which is open, modern, and has massive windows. Very easy to lose track of time in here. Careful with the wait in returns area at crowded times - deli ticket style and you may find you're 40+ numbers from where they're at when you arrive. Parking is easy and for everyone's sake just follow the instructions given by the attendants on your way in.< /Text>

I love ikea!!
Prices are always low, and variety of products are amazing.
I always seem to find myself lost in this store though. Not many employees hounding you to "help " you, which is great in my opinion because you have the freedom to actually shop around.<//Text>

<Text>I enjoy walking inside this store.  I discover new creations all the time.  Bed linens are so reasonably priced. Duvets, curtains, rugs and more duvets.   It is like an amusement park, so many interesting things.  It is so easy to get lost in this store but that is part of the adventure.  Check out the swedish frozen foods, chocolates and biscuits, yummy...or eat at the restaurant. If you want to buy indoor plants, come here first.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
huge! Freaking huge! Walking the entire path; show room, marketplace, self serve furniture and restaurant... can take up most of your day. There's a lot of items that are a better value than other retail stores, including online only stores, but do your research. The quality within Ikea varies greatly. Most furniture are particle board, compressed wood, but you can find solid wood options if you take the time to research. Those items tend to be on the high end of their price range.  The marketplace is my favorite. It'll help change your living space into a home. They even have fabric that you can cut by the yard. Between the artistic pattern fabrics and some iron-on hemming adhesive, I can make boring and horrible eyesore areas much more interesting.</Review>

The Burbank location is your typical IKEA experience, but at slightly larger scale.  Being larger, and from what I could hear from other patrons while I was shopping, more items seemed to be in greater stock at this location.  Items frequently out of stock at the Carson location were in plentiful supply here.  That may change as more people go to this newer location, or perhaps the increased size of this location is able to keep stock adequately for the demand.<//text>

No issues shopping, but the checkout /return/ pickup area is a disaster. Not enough cashier's and many lines without clear instructions leave people congregating. Also the parking lot is very poorly designed to get to your car with a cart with so many curbs etc.< /Text>

Everything is cheap, quality is pretty good (considering you follow the instructions). Great food selection in the food court with free coffee/tea for members. Also they have an espresso/latte/cappuccino machine with unlimited refills for free with membership (also free to sign up).

What's not to like? Affordable, decent quality stuff with lots of ideas for decorating and home making. Definitely a must for new home owners on a budget. Also fun to just spend the day walking around hanging out.<//text>

<Review>Exceptionally large venue. It has everything you could need in a home. The layout makes it almost like a theme park interactive ride. Food is really available and really well priced.  Could probably spend a whole day there<//Review><Name>Nikolai Cortez< /Name><pics>None</pics>< rating>

<Review>Parking and freeway access have improved but more signage in the parking lot would be good. The signs should direct traffic from the parking lot to the loading area and then to the exit. Also, when this place gets busy, you might feel like your being rushed through the aisles. Other than that, the shopping experience and selection were great!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Called Customer Service and waited for half an hour for the representative to pick up the phone. The rep transferred me to the appropriate department and I had to wait again... while waiting I did some work and had my lunch (another 40 min) and No Answer. The store is good, but some things are not working.< /Review>

This is a classy business and the retail assistance is very helpful to help you pick out Furniture if you come by yourself and even loaded into your car. The only frustration for me is not being able to get out of the place when I finally find what I want. They have a nice dining hall with the most reasonable prices and best food. I highly recommend going with a friend or bringing your list! It is likely that you are going to want everything and you are always going to be a bit shocked how inexpensive you can find things vs going to Target or a Bed Bath & Beyond.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Less and less frequently I am finding real value in this store. Instead of walking through a ridiculous maze and spending an hour or more of my day getting lost, I can just go online and by most of the stuff made by someone else for the same price or better from Amazon< /Text>

Had a very bad experience with the customer service at the returns department.   There was a big line of 40 people waiting to be called.  The cashiers are so rude and chit chatting although everyone were waiting to be called.  Manager didn't care.  5 customers were so upset that called manager to take care of things.  She casually told us that she knows they like to chit chat but wait to be called.  She didn't apologized for what was going on.  When I was called I had a mattress to return with no receipts.  One cashier named I think Rosa was giving me looks to the point that my 12 year old son was uncomfortable.   I tried to get her info and she made a big deal and called the security.  She told the security in front of me and all other customers that she will get my info from the ID I provided to use against me.  Horrible customer service!!!<//text>

They have super cute furnitures but I would of given 5 stars if their funitures that I liked was made out of real solid wood instead of composite wood.

The store is huge and had some great selections. Their parking lot is usually full and will take some time to find parking. The staffs are super helpful and  friendly. I adore their little decor rooms.< /Text>

It gets a bit crowded here like a Costco, so beware if you’re thinking about going on a weekend.< /review><Response>None<//Response></record>

Always ridiculously busy, but this location is much better design than the previous location. The new parking structure has lots of loading zones so that you can bring your cards and packages out to your car much more easily.

Tried their new stuffed chicken dish and it was amazing, plus I like the brussel sprouts that they've introduced.< /review>

<text>Have hardly seen all of the new store, because it's gigantic! The display spaces have become more elaborate, and feel more like multi-room homes that you can keep going further into. A lot of the newer items this season are well-made and well thought-out, and I particularly appreciate the return of un-finished and sturdier wooden items (with either simulated or actual wood-grain exposed).</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Had a very bad experience with the customer service at the returns department.   There was a big line of 40 people waiting to be called.  The cashiers are so rude and chit chatting although everyone were waiting to be called.  Manager didn't care.  5 customers were so upset that called manager to take care of things.  She casually told us that she knows they like to chit chat but wait to be called.  She didn't apologized for what was going on.  When I was called I had a mattress to return with no receipts.  One cashier named I think Rosa was giving me looks to the point that my 12 year old son was uncomfortable.   I tried to get her info and she made a big deal and called the security.  She told the security in front of me and all other customers that she will get my info from the ID I provided to use against me.  Horrible customer service!!!<//review>< user_name>

Good place to find all your furnishings at a good price but it's always crowded. But I do appreciate that they have staff that help people find parking! Makes shopping less stressful.< /text>

Staff barely helps you find your way and I got lost quite a bit ! The map idea is out dated! They need a better system. Furniture is not cheap. I bought a closet and after long 5 hours we finally built it. The moment we moved it all the cheap wood came apart!!! Not the store itself has good parking but make sure to remember where you parked...because it will take you hours to walk though the store... and even longer to wait in line afternoon . The staff in the registry and delivery were just amazing and friendly!</Review>

This place is huge and pretty amazing. During a hot day didn't know what to do and need some home items so we went here. First of all it has a great A/C to beat this heat. Second it has so much stuff to choose from and at a reasonable price. But best of all it has not only it's a little dining a read but also a snack area. So if you need home items, are hungry and want to beat the heat go here<//Text>

<Text>They are having serious issues dealing with reopening during this pandemic.  I tried to do click and collect, but that feature is not available at this store.  I then went to go into the store and when I got there, it was going to be over an hour to get in the door.  I'm just not willing to spend $99 to have what I need shipped to my house, so I'll try again, but this is an issue that needs to be resolved.</Text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>Went to the new big store for the first time.   Was kinda disappointed.   They used to have a great kitchen section.

First and last time shopping at Ikea. Absolutely horrible experience!!  Not only did they not show up for our same day delivery after waiting 4 hours they then showed up at the very end of the next 4 hour delivery window the next day (remember delivery was “promised” the day before). Then when they FINALLY arrived with the delivery one part was missing. When I finally reached someone at customer service they said it would take two days to get it to me!!! (20 miles away). I talked with three customer service people, 3 managers and was cut off on the phone 4 times. Once I finally got a manager to take action they said they would give me a $75 credit if I drove back to the store to pickup the part. When I got to the store they said they know nothing about the credit and would not give it to me. Needless to say Ikea sucks and they have absolutely no consideration or care for customers.

If you're hurting for a charge, don't come to the IKEA chargers. People constantly just parked here and not charging, ICE cars constantly parked here as well. There've been many times I have to stop here to charge but find nothing available even though the app states they're all available. Not the apps fault, people are just not charging. Wish either IKEA or Blink could put something in place here to make it possible to use these.

If you need a charge, head straight to the Burbank Mall, plenty of chargers there (Chargepoint), but it also suffers from the same issue, just far, FAR less than IKEA.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rate>3< /rate><Date>1570488661329< /Date>< user_name>

HUGE store, always great. A lot of variety and good pricing.You have to be careful with what you buy though because even though they have good pricing on almost all of the products, some things like furniture and mattresses are comparable to other stores and you might find them cheaper elsewhere. So dont hesitate to at least look online before making a big purchase $$$</review>

<Review>This place is a huge impersonal place. Thor direction indicators inside the monster maze was created by people who don’t understand directions. The employees are ill prepared to help customers with questions. In my case following the ikea workers direction s to the cashier area, I found myself outside the store with the items I wanted to buy in my hands.  So I had to go around the store from the outside and re-enter the store so I can go pay for my items. Customer service is week to non existent product quality is less than average. Employees are not prepared or willing to assist customers with questions. Last time I was here I left the over $2000 order with the manager and walked out because of the poor treatment than I went to Walmart and purchased my stuff there for about $600 less on top. Today I was in to buy a replacement faucet and a few other things. After I paid it took them about 30 minutes to get the item from furniture pickup.

Anyway I hate shopping here I only come when no other choice.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><username>Armen Harutunian</username>< userid>

The largest Ikea in all of North America. They literally have everything and anything in the Ikea catalog. Staff have been nice every time I've been there. The food in their restaurant is also always fresh and delicious. Love the meatballs! Never used their day care but seems to always be busy which I guess is a good thing.< /text>

Go get all the great ikea stuff! The furniture is well designed and well manufactured. The home furnishings are sharp looking and very functional. Make sure to stop by the restaurant and pick up a plate of the Swedish meatballs, simply delicious.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>HUGE store, always great. A lot of variety and good pricing.You have to be careful with what you buy though because even though they have good pricing on almost all of the products, some things like furniture and mattresses are comparable to other stores and you might find them cheaper elsewhere. So dont hesitate to at least look online before making a big purchase $$$< /text>< user_name>

This place is a huge impersonal place. Thor direction indicators inside the monster maze was created by people who don’t understand directions. The employees are ill prepared to help customers with questions. In my case following the ikea workers direction s to the cashier area, I found myself outside the store with the items I wanted to buy in my hands.  So I had to go around the store from the outside and re-enter the store so I can go pay for my items. Customer service is week to non existent product quality is less than average. Employees are not prepared or willing to assist customers with questions. Last time I was here I left the over $2000 order with the manager and walked out because of the poor treatment than I went to Walmart and purchased my stuff there for about $600 less on top. Today I was in to buy a replacement faucet and a few other things. After I paid it took them about 30 minutes to get the item from furniture pickup.

Anyway I hate shopping here I only come when no other choice.</Text>

<Review>Worst experience here. 5 lines to check out are all way too long. The kids area was open but wouldn't take our child. We ended up leaving without buying anything and dragging 2 small children kicking and screaming because they weren't getting the stuff we picked out together. Terrible and will likely never go back. Buy online and have it delivered, save yourself an anurism.<//Review><Rate>1</Rate><response>None</response><user>111631495110609527532<//user>< user_name>

I'm very biased because I love Ikea but I cannot say enough that this place is for everyone. They have a play place for kids, a cafeteria-style restaurant as well as their incredible home furnishings collections. When I was here in October, it was a bit crowded, especially in the warehouse area. And I don't know if it was just me, but I could not handle their carts at all?<//Text>

<Text>It's IKEA, with all that it entails. I'll be honest, I have never found the staff to be all that helpful. Never rude, but just either nonexistent or kind of clueless. Otherwise, whenever I want something low cost or something I can hack into what I want, I go here first. If you have read this far, here's the best part of IKEA: breakfast. Very low cost and delicious!< /Text>< pics>

The whole family loves Ikea. The food is delicious and cheap. They have really good prices for some things. We bought my daughter and even myself a brand new computer desk for $80. It's big and has lots of storage. It's a nice place to just walk around and spend time with the family. They also have great deals. For example. On September 19 and 20, 2015 (tomorrow) if you by more than $100 (not including tax), you eat for free. You first buy the food and then they give you a slip then you go downstairs and they'll give you you're money back that you payed for the food. WE LOVE IKEA!!!!! I RECOMMEND IT.</review>

<review>Terrific, new IKEA with ample parking. There is parking above and below ground, but I've found the underground parking is always packed.

It's easy to just wheel your purchases on a cart right to your vehicle as if you were at a grocery store. No need to move the car for loading.

The dining room is great. Pretty large. There are two separate lines at the steam table, and there are 3 or 4 cashiers. Join the Family Club and get free coffee anytime. Sometimes I'll just stop by to chill with a free coffee and enjoy the free WiFi.  It's like a busier Starbucks. And the bistro is now serving vegan/veggie hotdogs for $0.75.

Be sure to check the As-Is furniture section. That's where you'll find the best deals.

Pro tip: If you need to return something, for the love of all that's holy, don't go in the middle of the day. You could wait for hours at the return line. Seriously, hours. Instead, go either 1st thing when they open or right before closing.</review>< userid>

Walking 3 miles to buy a few cheaply made items - like a cow forced along a path.  Ending up in a warehouse finding your item is not there.</text>

The new location is awesome. Great prices. So much to see and buy and so little time in a day. Free coffee if you have your family membership and special discounts I believe. You can find almost everything for your entire home and garden. Plenty underground  parking. This is a must go place! Dress comfortable shoes.</Text>

Ikea!  They're all the same, basically, but this one feels cooler than the others because it's in LA.  It's like the ikea to the stars, if the stars went to Ikea.  Does everyone go to IKEA?  Somehow I think so, at least online or via a courier or some other fancy method.  Who can resist the charms of a $5 mirror or a lamp that can also be a hat?!<//review>

This branch is one of the largest in the U.S. Parking space gets filled in early. But don't worry, they have underground parking as well. In the hot summer time, underground parking is much much better. Their restaurant/cafe is huge. In the peak time, lines are formed, though. If you are Ikea Family, coffee is free. If not, they provide coffee for $1: which is a bargain. Coffee options are: Americano, Latte, Cappuccino, and Espresso, as well as drip coffee. It is a great place to kill time.< /Text>

< Review>
Ikea Burbank provided us terrible delevery service. Firstly, they gave us 10am to 2pm on Friday. So we waited them all day but nobody called us. And then we called to Ikea contact center, at this time they told us "your delivery schedule was changed". We are going to bring it tomorrow 10am to 2pm. It was terrible again. We can't understand their delivery system and their service. Their quality is not international standard. Ikea doesn't think about customers. It was Friday. The other problem was they didn't promise tomorrow again.  Nobody showed tomorrow, nobody contacted us tomorrow. So we called Ikea again and then they told us "your delivery schedule was changed". Delivery truck will be there 3pm to 7pm. Nobody told us changed delivery schedule. This day was Saturday. My family lost all Friday and Saturday. And we are waiting now. The most important thing is that now I am on vacation. You can understand? Because of IKEA, my family didn't do anything on an vacation. It is a chance to enjoy with my family once in a year. IKEA service was terrible.<//Review>

<Review>It's the biggest IKEA in the US.  Like any other, you start at the top and work your way through a showroom layout until you get to the bottom area where they have loose stuff and boxed items on shelves.  It's pretty similar to other IKEA stores, but there are significantly more showrooms set up.  If you shop a lot of IKEA and like looking at how their products can be combined to make for a complete room, it's worth a slow stroll through the store.  There's ample parking on two levels.</Review><time>1493526878951< /time>< Pics>

One of my favorite places to walk around (even if I don't buy anything) just to see what kinds of furniture are available and get some ideas about decorating my place. Although people say the furniture is flimsy, I actually have some Ikea furniture I've owned for more than ten years that are still sturdy. So I guess it depends on your perception and what you choose to believe. I do think they make good quality products that are easier to transport home in a car and setup yourself.< /Text>

Packed inside and out, you can't access food court unless you wait for a very long time. Parking outside is extremely difficult, the only parking you'll find is underground.

Inside is packed and it's difficult to get around, one of the more difficult Ikea's ice been too. The better one is in Carson, California.< /Text>

<text>The furniture was reasonably priced, the food was good, and there is plenty of parking. I can't say that I had any complaints.

I'll be returning with a truck someday to pick up furniture and shelving for a room we're adding onto the house. It's about a three hour drive, but the furniture prices are difficult to find elsewhere.</text>< Response>

The expected Ikea experience. Huge and yet you eventually find what you need, or help the is friendly and often knowledgeable. And who can pass up a soft serve ice cream in the summer heat?</Review>

OK. It took me a while to get the courage to deal with the crowds, but it's worth the effort and time. The food at the restaurant is inexpensive and very tasty. The flow of the store is pretty good too.< /text>

This place is huge. I believe it is now the largest IKEA in North America. We stop by periodically for kitchen gadgets and other inexpensive household items. We've purchased a number of items throughout the years, and although some items didn't last long (most items are made to last only if they stay put...moving IKEA furniture lessens the usable years). One shiny point is the cafe. Some have said the meatballs have gone downhill, but I still find them delicious. It is also a place where a family of 4 can eat for under $30. When they have the "Kids Eat Free" promotion, it's even cheaper. It's also a place where you can wander the aisles for a bit to escape the heat in the summer. The kids area (Småland) is a great (free) place to drop off your kids for a brief respite or cup of coffee in the cafe. If you join IKEA FAMILY, the coffee is also free.<//Text>

This place is big and has just about everything. The staff is helpful and does direct you to the right places, or offer suggestions/help with minor accommodations. The only problem is that this place gets relatively packed, and fast. Thus, it gets loud.<//Review>

They haven't figured out parking even in the new location. Should have green and red lights at each space of free or occupied or counters for how many spots left at each section. Nice selection of furniture and household goods</text>

< review>
I'm a huge IKEA fan. Walking through the showrooms is always fun, and the food is ridiculously affordable and delicious. Sign up for IKEA Family (their free rewards program) for free tea/coffee, extra childcare time, and member-only discounts. If you have kids that are too small for the childcare (smaland), be sure to bring a stroller or pick up a cart at the beginning- it's a lot of walking. Leave plenty of time to check out the marketplace! Tip: The yellow bags are for shopping, and the blue bags are for your purchases. Bring your own reusable bags if you don't want to buy blue bags, because they don't do any paper or plastic ones at the checkout. If you can remember, get the reusable bags from the IKEA Family section upstairs instead- they have the ones that fold up really small, and we literally use them for everything!<//review>

<review>Good value for money but I dont have the best experience with their customer services. Also the delivery services are not very good; some stuff I ordered arrived very late and was damaged. They offered to pay me back the shipping but never delivered on their promise. In general, if you expect good cuatomer service, don't go.< /review>< pictures>

Hugh selections of towels, bath supplies, children's toys, kitchen equipment, cooking utensils, flatware, plates, diner ware sets, various patterns, shower curtains, linens (sheet sets) various sizes, rugs, curtains and even pillows. This is one store that someone could utilize to furnish their entire home with. With the new craze of tiny houses and multiple purpose furniture, this is a honey hole​ for those things. The one thing I did not see there was a gas burning fireplace. Everything ELSE WAS THERE.
A small food court, fast conveyance for everyone.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place is about furniture. People go here to buy furniture. However that's not what I usually do. I come here for their cafeteria food. Pretty good and a great value. If you've never been you gotta try their food they have some pretty good deals on there Swedish meatballs. As far as Furniture shopping goes I really do like how they have the whole setup so all their Furniture so it's all displayed so you can see how it would work once it's put together.<//Review>< Pics>

Wow this Ikea is huge. They have everything that you might need for home furnishings, and they ever have a nice selection of house plants to add to your furnishings you get, which I think is a real plus. Plus, the food court is huge and has a lot.of things to grab if you're feeling famished through the time that you're looking to upgrade your house or room!</review>

Amazing food!! And the furniture is really well designed but affordable. The large, open displays are really convenient and truly show what a room could look like with proper interior design. IKEA is by far my favorite furniture restaurant.< /Review>

<Review>IKEA Restaurant Burbank:

99¢ Breakfast (scrambled eggs, potatoes and links) - delicious.  $2.99 for complete Swedish + American Breakfast.  Coffee, 45¢.  Love the cafeteria style.  Arrive early - restaurant opens at 9:30 a.m.  Great way to start a shopping day.  Store opens at 10:00 a.m.

Breakfast for 2 was under $4.00!</Review><resp>None</resp><username>Jeannette G.< /username>< userid>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I hate this place. "To buy this item take a picture of this code" stand in line for half an hr, get sent back to another desk where they print a paper with the same code but dont have a register stand in line for half an hr again.... what's even the point. If you're supposed to go to aisle 26 before you go to the register than the tag on the item should say "proceed to aisle 26." #wastemytime2019

UPDATE: What was the point of wasting two hours of my life in your store to buy one thing and then pay for special delivery only for it to arrive in two boxes needing to be assembled? I would've just ordered it online if I knew it was going to come like this. Seriously, who delivers a couch in boxes?!<//review></record>

<text>The place is set up so it's actually hard to find things to make you look around. If you've been before then you know what to expect but it's hard to have a short visit.
The checkout experience was very poor the line had to have been at least 10 people long and it took quite a while for them to open up other check stands.
In short prepare to spend a lot of time there<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Hellish Covid protocols. Expect a minimum 45 minute wait outside just to enter the showroom. Returns queue also equally long. It’s impossible to spend less than two hours to do anything here now. Buy online if you can!<//text>

Better than the older one. Not really more items, just with more room through the isles it's easier for everyone. Quite a few items for new color schemes though. That was good.</text>

<review>I totally do not like this place or will I go back, much easier to buy online. The store is way to big and not enough employees. Every time I find something and need help with questions but no one around to help me with the item. By the time I am able to find an employee I have walked way to far to go back and was just fed up with the whole thing. I tell you the only good thing about the store was the snack bar, they had a coffee machine that made amazing coffee.</review>< user_name>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>I've always loved IKEA furniture - it's modern and affordable. I also appreciate that now they offer the assembly service, since that's most of the negative comments I hear about their products. And their food is delicious and cheap; what a great idea to have the restaurant in the store for people and families who get cranky when they're hungry. In general, IKEA trips can be overwhelming. The store is a huge maze, so if you want to go through the whole thing, prepare yourself mentally and physically. It can be exhausting.

I do wish this location had more staff. I went to go return an item (a gift), and the lack of staff working in this section left a couple dozen of us waiting around the customer service for too long (40 minutes). Same with the cafeteria - it took us way too long to get through the line during lunchtime. You would think they would prepare for rushes better.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>Standard IKEA. You enter, walk around, peruse, then go to the level that have all the parts, pay and load up the car! The only thing I noticed was that there sign up kiosks were ALL out of order. But if you're already a member it wouldn't affect you. The staff helped us lift parts off the parcels and offered to help us load it to the car too< /text>< username>

Some employees at some stores make sighing sounds or try to avoid eye contact so we don't "bother" them. However, Edwin helped me from A to Z and didn't stop until he got what I needed.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

But: heaven help you if there's a problem.
They sold me a defective piece of junk (in one of two identical pieces, a hole was not drilled properly), and I've never experienced a customer service experience like this.
Their phone tree software has random dropouts in its voice synthesizer, and - literally from the moment their phone service is open in the morning - its only tool is to hang up on you, telling you they're experiencing "unusual call volumes".
Their web comment form asks for mysterious codes, such as requiring that you enter the date in a strange format literally no-one uses ("YYWW"). And, I assume they'll ignore it, too.
I realize they basically have a monopoly, but, please: stay away.</Review><UserId.>104045933176923122581< /UserId.>< Resp>

<text>This location has a very convenient parking lot outdoor and indoor, it also has a loading area. Some of the products you buy here needs assembly and that might take some time.
Make sure you try their ice cream it's so good only 130 calories.
The hotdog is less than a $1.00.< /text>< pictures>

This IKEA is HUUUUGE. Like literally huge. We just checked the place out and ate because we were hungry and their dining area is huge. I think they are expecting to have lots of people around. When I went there, it was a weekday so the crowd wasn't as bad as probably the weekends. You're going to love their layout. Extremely huge compared to their old location.

Stop by and enjoy looking at stuff you may want to put in your home.<//Review>

But I liked going and they have short ribs, stuffed chicken w/o bacon. I can't eat pork. Reducing the options we allergy peeps have will cause me to stop coming. Lines were horribly long as well idk what was going on.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

For the most part, everything is organized and in stock. I knocked a star off because people park in the 15 min loading section and then go shopping and nothing is done about it. There were only 3 useable loading spots that everyone was waiting to use.</review>

The parking lot attendants make the journey a whole lot more enjoyable by guiding people to parking spaces instead of letting everyone get all flustered before even going inside. It may seem like a small detail, but it really sets the pace for a great experience. Sometimes I'll make the trip up from DTLA just to grab a pack of cinnamon rolls from the downstairs cafe. It's not that I can't have some high grade snacks delivered right to my door, but the customer service at Burbank IKEA is worth finding an excuse to make the trip. I recommend going there the next time you're having a bad day, then ask a few questions to whomever is available as you mosey about the showroom. I guarantee you will walk out feeling a bit uplifted.</review>

< Review>
It’s so big! Feels like a furniture store theme park. Great for what it is. But after enduring the crowds, labyrinth two level show rooms and long check out lines, it feels like it’s taken a day or two off my life after each visit.

Pros: they have real looking fake plants. They have fake looking real plants.

Cons: Lots of crowded and waiting in line. All of the staff never seems to get  “”It’s so big!” That’s what she said”, joke.<//Review>

Great place to grab a quick breakfast or snack. Merchandise is good overall but one must check it carefully for quality. Good location to just walk around in and enjoy the air conditioning.</text>

They give you a delivery time if you miss their call you are out of luck.  If you reschedule delivery you are out of luck because either it will never get there and they will not call you that it is not coming or they will lie to you that it is coming but never arrives.  If you reschedule because they never delivered or informed you that it is not coming the day you reschedule it still doesn’t come the time frame they give you.  They don’t even care if you have kids to pick up if they delivery past the delivery time that was given to you.

This is the worst place to shop. Very unprofessional , unorganized and short-handed. You would think a huge corporation like Ikea would have enough staff to provide a good shopping experience but that's not the case. Me and my family we had to wait half hour to get to the register and then another half hour to get our products. I am not shopping here ever again.< /text>

This is a brand new location after they moved down the street. The same everything except now a lot more room and space to walk around. Plus huge parking. Good place to buy compact furniture that doesn't take a lot of space in your home.<//Text>

I had a pleasant shopping experience. The store is huge and has lots of showrooms. Everything is organized and it was a breeze finding what we wanted. We had lunch there as well and the food was pretty good.</Review>

Great ideas and furniture. We were looking for bath remodel ideas.  There are many suggestions for decor.  Restaurant is good too.<//Text>

Since relocating to their gigantic new store, I have renewed my obsession with Ikea.  Their vastly expanded number of experience (demo) rooms give you even more ideas for how to use their products.  The new store is so large, it is now easier than ever to get lost in it!  The food is very reasonably priced and quite tasty (please do not expect fine dining here).  Parking is even more plentiful, especially now that it is not shared with the Burbank Mall.  I cannot wait to go back again!< /text>

This company is the worst. I ordered a bunch of furniture, which was supposed to be delivered a week ago. The delivery guys they use (T Force) speak no english, showed up many hours later than I was told, and "lost" my sofa. I've had to call Ikea numerous times (in every case on hold for over an hour), and still have no sofa.< /review>

Many home furnishings at good prices. Plenty of parking spaces. Allow yourself time to explore all areas and corners; you will surely find something useful to take home with you even if you go there simply to walk around.<//text>

This place is a city lol, it's that big. But there's something for everyone. If you can't find anything, you didn't look hard enough. The customer service is very friendly and always willing to help show you have furniture works, especially the ones the fold, flip, and transform into other things.</Review>

Sometimes you can't tell if you're going in the right direction. Then, when we got to the furniture pickup area, the guys were waaay to slow on pulling up the furniture from the warehouse. It took us almost an hour to receive our few pieces of furniture even though they did not have many orders to do.</Text><Date>1520999704457</Date>< Response>

Make sure to get there early as even on weekdays you will find a line forming before they open. It is not unheard of for the parking lots to be at capacity either. Very clean however, and I believe it is the largest US IKEA.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Good value for money but I dont have the best experience with their customer services. Also the delivery services are not very good; some stuff I ordered arrived very late and was damaged. They offered to pay me back the shipping but never delivered on their promise. In general, if you expect good cuatomer service, don't go.<//Text>

< review>
i visited Ikea Burbank today 7/21/2017 and on the way home i decided I wanted to cancel a delivery that I had scheduled for tomorrow. My first call to cancel the delivery started at 5:19PM and was placed on hold for 32minutes with no assistance. second attempt I was on hold for 1 hour and 29 minutes; while on hold at 7:10PM I had someone else called to cancel.I got frustrated and kept on calling back numerous times starting at 7:10PM and ending at 8:04PM; when i got a text from my help telling that she was with someone on the phone already cancelling my delivery; her call began at 7:10 and ended at 8:04PM; it took almost three hours to get someone on the phone and being placed on hold for almost 3 hours on the very first call after 32 minutes someone answered and although i told her that i had been on hold for 32 minutes she explained to me that she could not help me and she still transfer me supposedly to the correct section and warned me not to hung up because they were busy, that's the time when i was on hold for 1 hour and 29 minutes; for being a huge company you would think they would have some kind of sense and have more people during the days and times when they know they are the busiest; extremely poor management call; I have to say that i had never had such poor to almost non-existent customer service; failing at every aspect when it comes to phone relations; OH AND BY THE WAY IN ORDER TO POST THIS REVIEW I HAD TO AT LEAST GIVE THEM A STAR OTHERWISE THE SYSTEM DID NOT ALLOW ME TO POST; AND TRUST ME THE ONLY REASON WHY I GAVE THEM A STAR IS SO THAT I CAN POST MY DISCONTENT WITH THEIR SERVICE; I WILL TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AND WILL CONTACT IKEA'S CORPORATE OFFICES.< /review>

Only chance I had to visit the in a long time . I came for storage to spruce up our kitchen saw a bunch of amazing deals that I can't pass up like a curtain rod system that cost below $2 that's insane and a kitchen rail system for less than $7 that's with rail s hooks and 4 utensil holder.

<text>Wow has this store grown! I was on an Ikea project in New Jersey almost twenty years ago. Their inventory was massive then. Now, almost twenty years later..I can't believe it. First of all the quality has taken a dramatic turn for the better. Their furniture is really the best buy out their. Quality is A +.  Great eating facilty..home furnishings galore. Dont go big name before you check out Ikea. Jerry Garcia..Chris Cornell..Janis..Prince..Michael..even Lennon would shop here. If the were alive of course.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Mark Perone< /username><Response>None</Response><time>1536946333242<//time>< user>

<Review>Update: Their pickup system is the worst - waited over 2 hrs just to pick up a shelf. The employee's have no idea how long the wait would be. And, this is on a Wednesday morning. I don't even want to imagine the weekend wait time.

Previous review: Was able to get in and out rather quickly because of the shortcut to to the marketplace.<//Review>< pictures>

Great way to buy good quality furniture at a reasonable price (provided you don't mind assembling it - and even there they make it easy). Built a library that curves around three walls of my den and reaches up to 9' high - awesome - they even have a library ladder available for those really tall installations!<//text>

<review>Sorry but you guys have the worst service.... I ordered online and got a temporary order number, later the email confirmation didn't came, one week went by without notice, reached out to customer service, phone does not pick up, it says " we are experiencing high volume of calls" and hangs up. Emailed customer support, but only has option for business order, after got an email back saying that they have encounter problem and will fix and send out an email with confirmation. But one week goes by and no email or call back. Emailed them to cancel order, but not knowing they will charge me anyway.... Decided to go drive out to  Ikea on a very busy schedule to Ikea to order and place for delivery and the assembly, so that my out of town guests will have a bed to sleep on... Delivery occurred on the day but the box has broken furniture, and the assembler is a 2nd vendor that Ikea has hired, they tell me to call Ikea and request another delivery. What?! call Ikea when the automated call keeps hanging up... Well able to get through after calling repetitively for about 20 minutes... got them on the call and finally the 2nd delivery comes. But again the box has furniture has broken pieces again... Wow! please Ikea, check your stuff before sending the furniture out!!!</review><Rating>1</Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a< /gmap_id><date>1544723867622</date>< response>

This new IKEA is heaven, they fixed the lack of parking and loading the old location had! Now there are two levels of parking with plenty of loading spaces! The cafeteria is huge with plenty of seating. The floor is big and they made the isles wider. Staff was great and they had people guiding traffic. Great IKEA!<//review>

<text>I love Ikea! They have awesome deals every time I visit there. Although many people go there to buy furnitures, I like to shop little things. I recently bought LED strip light and hanged indoor. Also I got my espresso cup for $10 and it is sooo cute! They have one of my favorite Swedish meatball meals and fish roe paste. This is my favorite place to shop during the weekends. They even make Bone China dishes and some nice stonewares are only $0.99 per piece! What a great deal! I will visit Ikea often again :)<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTcJ7ydwJNPmQay4G1MRc9EptJ3Ed4owh1QtRB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSf0GGT7PUmkdKWadwa69Fv5Vvej4Cwo1V-tsy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbNRopm6g6cXxv8nx8NT8jhYKF1_10hUDFvihw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Worst service. Bought a 1000 wardrobe. Paid for delivery and assembly 300$. They come and refuse to construct it because of my base board, but it wasn't a problem the first time I bought a wardrobe. Had to refuse everything. Trying to get a hold of higher management and was told to call back tomorrow.</Review>

Re: delivery and install service.
Company T Force Final Mile

Terrible. Terrible communication. Rude customer service- so rude that if you ask relevant questions that deserve a reasonable answer, they don't know what to say so they just hang up on you!
Hours and hours late. The delivery dispatch does not communicate with headquarters and delivery driver does not answer his phone. So when they are 4 hours + late no one can get you an ETA on arrival.
IKEA PLEASE DROP THEM. PLEASE DONT USE THEM AS A DELIVERY SERVICE-
completely unprofessional and even tho it's not IKEA doing the delivery, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth about your company IKEA.

****after 6 hours waiting (past the original delivery window of 10-2pm) for delivery and being assured delivery was coming— no one showed up. No phone call. No explanation.< /review>

Omg. There 5 hrs. We take it slow, my honey has a back problem. Of course he got hungry,  the swedish meatballs aren't bad. We found a storage long cabinet for the kitchen in the bathroom department and the hook shelf and picture frames we went for. Enjoyable day with plenty of steps!< /review>

The overhead view is of me in a Maze and you see what I'm hunting a few steps away. And I take a wrong turn and I'm on the wrong path. And the people are watching enjoy a good laugh. You may never get out of this maze but at least they have a good $2 breakfast!<//Text>

<Text>I love Ikea in general. The new location has ample parking, organized design, and many options in the food court. My only suggestion is that they have each dish labeled.

Restaurant was my favorite spot, until they discontinued the chicken meatballs. Like really? It's already sad there isn't much gluten free options. But I liked going and they have short ribs, stuffed chicken w/o bacon. I can't eat pork. Reducing the options we allergy peeps have will cause me to stop coming. Lines were horribly long as well idk what was going on.<//text>

<Review>I like Ikea but they've moved into a much larger space and though I didn't need very many things finding a way down to the checkout desks is virtually impossible I left my bag right by the door that lets you out right there

The place was a giant maze as other location. I try to buy a specific item quick but had to spend 10 minutes to just get to the item.
I could not find shotcuts to the department I wanted to go. There were so many people and had carts.
I suggest avoiding weekends if you need to shop at this location.
They had to put people in the parking structure to guide where to park and how to get out.
Normally, arrow sign and 'Exit' sign works in most buildings but not here.< /Review>

Place a bit crowded but we still able to navigate the store with some patience.  The items we were looking for were easy to find. With today's technology why is it that stores like IKEA have the stuff that you are looking for out of stock.<//Text>

Go during the day on weekdays if you hate getting stuck behind people who walk slowly. That said, there is still plenty of parking even on the weekends when it's slammed.

Rumor has it this is the largest IKEA in the states - not sure if that's true, but it's definitely a big place.</Review>

Organized and clean. Get a coffee and walk around getting ideas about how to maximize the use for what they sell. Before you know it you will see how you can use their items for your home.<//Text>

<text>It's an amazing place. Huge show rooms. The only down side is that despite being the largest Ikea in the nation, their stock runs out pretty quick had to go in twice to buy a couch. They ran out twice. instead went to the Ike in Carson where they 6 available couches in store.

<text>IKEA is IKEA.  Very consistent in their layout and products offered. However, it seemed the items I wanted were out of stock or on back order. The check out lines were long and kind of sad they took out the self service checkouts.< /text>< Response>

<review>I can't say IKEA furniture is the best quality. Some of their stuff is really good, others seem cheap and low quality. Still, they have a decent selection of things, and you usually get a decent things for the price.

I don't know what they put in their meatballs but they are really good! The cafeteria is a must stop for me whenever I come here.

Customer service is really good as well. We got some stools here and my girlfriend didn't like how one of the back rests looked like. We took that single part back to IKEA and they switched it out for us, no hassle. We did have to wait for ~30min to go and retrieve the part though.<//review><pics>None</pics>< username>

<time>1347036586275< /time><text>This is about Ikea's delivery service vendor Dynamics.

Ordered a wonderful desk online. Paid nearly 50% of the total cost of the desk (extra) in shipping. Was told to expect it on Friday. Then they called, they were delivering Thursday - (not actually good for me, but I committed to a major shuffle). You know where this is going; they just never showed.

Called Friday to get it rescheduled, they could not delivery it on Friday because it would somehow violate the laws of time and space causing the universe to implode upon itself.

Dynamics tells me they are powerless to do pretty much anything and I should contact Ikea directly. Welcome to half hour wait times or some kind of terrifying automated deflection system on their web site.

In summary: The experience sucked out loud. Next time I will order from anyone else.

If someone from Ikea reads this, here is the take-away / action-item: Honor your commitments or bend over backwards to make it right. Nothing else is acceptable.</text><UserId.>113253914380212177663< /UserId.>< Resp>

Yes it’s decently priced and we furnished 80% of our new apartment with it, only downside is it is a gigantic store and by the time you weave your way to the end you are exhausted, like a day at a theme park. Overall great service. Then you get to go home and spend the weekend assembling it all!!!!!!!!< /Review>

<review>If you ever have to deal with ordering, spare parts etc in customer service, you need to expect the worst service that you will ever experience IN YOUR LIFE....

EXPECT that after taking up to an hour to get helped, spending more time on the phone to place an order for replacement hardware or whatever,  that in the end, long after stuff is supposed to arrive, you'll BE CALLING THEM AGAIN, and they will tell you that "somehow" your order is no longer in their system.

You'll order it all again, taking them 30 MORE minutes of your time. And IT WILL MOST LIKELY HAPPEN AGAIN!!!!

They REFUSE to have a full-fledged online website to allow people to simply order their own parts or replacements. Nope. They FORCE you to deal with their hired IDIOTS who don't understand their own ordering system!!!

Nope, buy elsewhere, unless you live VERY close to their store.</review>< gmapID>

A pretty large ikea and i was told one of the biggest that exists. It has a huge selection and you'll probably find the thing you're looking for. I don't like the layout at ikea since it makes you walk the different paths to get you to see the furniture and impulse buy things. But besides that, this is a huge ikea that has it all.<//Text>

It. Is. Huge! Be sure to budget a good 2 1/2 hours for this place, because it will definitely take that long. Lots of amazing furniture at very reasonable prices, but you do have to put it together yourself. So there's that.</Text>

It's the mega IKEA!

You know why you're coming here.

Fortunately this location has been designed for large crowds - it's got plenty of parking, lots of staff and a big restaurant.

Most importantly it's setup so you can take your shopping cart all the way to your car (unlike the old Burbank location).< /text>

I love coming to Ikea. They have such a great variety of household needs. I can certainly spend a day here, especially since they serve food here. The one down side to coming to Ikea is coming on a weekend. It is difficult to find parking, there is a line to food court, and likes to the register. Sometimes it can be difficult to walk through the display models.

Other than the overwhelming amount of people on the weekends Ikea is a neat place to pick out products for your home. The employees are friendly too, for the most part.<//Text>

<Text>Outstanding value!  The Swedish breakfast consists of scrambled eggs,  home fries,  2 sausage links and 3 crepes-all for $2.00.  The four quality is great.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a< /GmapID><Pics>None< /Pics><name>David Luja-King</name>< date>

This Ikea is like all others in the world....except for the the fact that their delivery service is unreliable. I get that they are busy and that there are unforeseen problems that delay delivery services but 4 hours out of my day waiting for an order that doesn't arrive, nearly an hour on hold with Ikea with no resolution and still no merchandise are all things that do not make for a happy customer. Shop at this IKEA, just bring your own transportation unless you have days to wait around your house and a  high tolerance for being kept on hold.<//Review>

This is the first review of the store since it moved from its old location. It is now the largest IKEA in North America and the second largest in the world! This is noticeable as you walk through the store but especially clear in the restaurant which has about 3x the seating.
Though I never thought "That wasn't big enough" after leaving an IKEA store, this location really is an amazing display of the IKEA shopping experience at its highest.< /Review>

<text>I am torn about what to write in this review.  The gentleman (Jason, I believe) who was part of the Kitchen design crew was A+.  Very patient, extraordinarily helpful, and worked with us every step of the way on our $5000+ new kitchen purchase.

Unfortunately, the folks in the department where we went to pick up the 400+ pieces of our kitchen (this was a "full service" order, where IKEA gathers the items for you) were, in a word, awful.  After waiting 2 hours, we were told the order had not yet begun to be assembled because we had not paid for it.  Which was not true.  When I asked to speak to a manager, she was even worse.  Her name was Bernadette and she was, at the time, in charge of the entire store.  Unfortunately, she was wholly unqualified to interact with human customers.  She made no effort to indicate that the gentleman who said our order had not yet been paid for was wrong, and made no effort to even acknowledge my obvious frustration.  Instead, she was rude, incredibly condescending, and dishonest (and I do not use these words lightly).  I submitted a lengthy explanation of my concerns using IKEA's in-store feedback kiosk and have yet to hear back from anyone about what went wrong.  Suffice it to say, we love IKEA products but I cannot in good faith recommend the Burbank store to anyone.  I plan to follow up with IKEA about my unfortunate experience in writing and will update this rating if the results are more satisfactory.  Until then, enjoy the IKEA products (they are great, no question), but prepare yourself in advance for what might be an extremely unpleasant experience at the Burbank location.< /text>< pics>

Three years ago I bought 12 linear feet of IKEA PAX wardrobes with the wire baskets and shelves, because my house has no closets. It helps me stay real organized, everything has a place. When I do the laundry, its super simple to put everything in its place.< /review>

I'm torn about this location. Yes, it's HUGE.  It's very well organized but during busy times it is miserable due to the crowds and the narrowness of the main aisle. I think this location has every single thing on display, though. That would be the #1 reason I would recommend visiting this over any other Ikea locations.< /Text>

Ikea is a very huge store, it has almost anything in regards to home goods. We come yearly for new furniture to give away to charity or to the less unfornunates. And we are picky on the quality because of the wood deteriating over time. Always research what you purchase, and then also the store offers 1 full year return. Just make sure its not damaged like scratched to hell or broken hinges and stuff like that. They can replace the parts at a price or not. Check out your local store.</Text>

Ikea is great for some things, but you can easily end up with a house identical to your friend's houses. Nothing unique, but at the same time there are millions of happy people who use I phone, just like many other people. So I guess what works, is good enough for the majority.< /text>

This is the "new" IKEA in Burbank. Overall it is better than the old location, but still just lacks higher quality items, especially bedroom and living room stuff. Some of thier kitchen & bathroom items are getting close to professional quality, but thier sofas & beds still smack of college dorm room levels of execution.

The store here does have ample parking and a great snack bar area.< /text>

Oh IKEA... the twisting corridors of items I want to purchase in every aisle. I swear I could live here without anyone knowing. Lol.

Anyway, it's not too busy during the weekdays. Parking was relatively easy to find. I came here for the food. Was surprised to see that the prices have significantly increased compared to their old location. I guess they have to get their money back somehow.

Hotdogs are now 3.25 for 2 plus a drink. Upstairs in the food court has newer dishes that I haven't seen like gravlax [cured salmon]. Meatballs are always a great option. Their sodas are also delicious.<//review>

<Date>1465289969516< /Date><Rate>4<//Rate><Review>This IKEA has the distinction of being one of the more popular IKEA stores in the US and at the same time one of the more frustrating IKEA's to shop at. This is due to its convenient location nestled amongst several other hot places to shop in the heart of Burbank and also due to a most unaccommodating parking and loading areas making for a very frustrating experience trying to leave the store after your purchase is finalized. Parking aside, the Burbank IKEA is still a great place to shop, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the product range is fun and unique, and who doesn't love Swedish meatballs?!?

Shopping tip: Google has a tool in Google Maps that tracks the traffic any given location receives throughout the day, use this information to plan what time of day would give you the best experience.

FYI: IKEA has started construction on a new IKEA store in Burbank, it is planned to be the largest IKEA retail store in North America and offer significantly better parking than the current store. Now there's something to look forward to!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a< /GmapID></record>

Four stars only because I'm a dweeb and didn't realize until checking out that this Ikea was NOT the one in Burbank. I was walking around thinking I knew the place, and getting irritated thinking the store had been vastly rearranged. I was so turned around. Not until I got to the check out and asked when they built the parking garage and the woman said it had always been there that I thought I had traveled to another dimension. I whispered, "we're in Burbank, right?" To which the woman said "oh no! This is closer to Glendale! We moved ages ago!" True. I hadn't been there in a year or so.
So really, I myself am the reason it's not getting 5 stars because I thought Ikea had changed the inside without telling me. As if I owned the damn place.
But really. I love Ikea.</Text>

Always love coming to IKEA. Usually find good furniture I like, building it can be tricky ESPECIALLY if the screws just won't go in right but that's not usually a problem. Just be very careful with the instructions (which are only pictures but are detailed enough to make sense) Customer service is always amazing and the food is great and extremely inexpensive. I always end up buying the more expensive stuff cuz it just looks so nice lol<//Text>

Pros: Cheap food and cheap furniture! I like digging through the discounted furniture by the registers. One time they had all of their lightbulb going for .50 apiece! Those are 90s prices, I love it! Lots of parking.

Cons: I love how big this IKEA is, but I miss the old Burbank IKEA's layout. Walking to and from the ends of the showroom is exhausting. Sometimes you just want to leave already!</review>

Great for food inside of a furniture super store. They kinda have the business cornered. Swedish meat balls are great. Hotdogs not so much. Cinnamon buns smell better then they taste but everything is priced exactly what your getting so it's all good.<//Review>

Probably one of the better IKEAs to go to. I bought a couch here that I like for fairly cheap, but the quality of the furniture here isn't very good, and requires some interesting interpretation of the instructions to assemble correctly.</review>

Cool store. Lots to choose from. Bit annoying to traverse as they make you walk through hundreds of products in many different rooms before you get to what you actually want. Little annoying but a nice, clean store. Friendly staff. Parking is readily available to say the least.<//text>

<Text>If only I didn't end up spending so much dang money every time I walk into IKEA! They're very good at making you realize that you need a lot of different things. Mostly meatball-related things.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The new location has much better parking, a giant restaurant for all your meatball-related needs, and a larger selection of both furniture and household items. Loading your car is now much easier.</text>

Wow...what an upgrade from the old IKEA location! The furniture & sample displays are awesome. Many ideas to create your house and home. Having the largest 600 seating area of a restaurant in Los Angeles, what else can you ask for?</text>

Biggest IKEA in the US did not disappoint. Found everything I needed and it was so much fun to go through the models! Service leaves a bit to be desired. Not surprising for IKEA though. Seems like most employees hate working there for some reason. Luckily the contact with them is minimal.<//text>

The quality of the furnishing is so much better than it was in the past.  The new building off Alameda is HUGE.  You can lose your way if you try to find the shortcuts because there are fewer shortcuts.<//text>

Huge store with every conceivable home furnishing, but don't come here thinking you can just get in and get out.  This labyrinthine store is designed for browsing.  If you aren't interested in browsing the whole gigantic store, finding your way out can be a challenge.  Finding your way out quickly is impossible.< /text>

After reading reviews on Google, I cannot say that now I am surprised by the service. First, the Ektorp couch, believe it or not, is MISSING an ARM OF THE COUCH. Yes, an entire arm of the couch is missing in the packaging. We called IKEA, waited, and a case was opened. We will see how long this takes to resolve. Second, when we could not find a part, we called IDEA, waited 20 minutes, and then the customer service representative said we had to come into the store to tell them the part we were missing.  Then, they would order, then we would have to come back for the part. Seriously? No case management, no ability to solve issues for a customer on the phone.  We live 1.5 hours away.  They would expect us to drive a total of 6 hours, for 1 part. Why can't they mail it, and, demonstrate customer care. So - we would not purchase from IKEA again unless we live within close driving distance.< /review>

<review>Compared to the old Ikea in Burbank this one's a lot bigger a lot more grandiose that being said I think Ikea should be outlawed for their Insanity of size and the amount of time you have to spend inside of a store to purchase any small item. That being said Ikea does carry a bunch of great stuff and for what kind of store it is it's actually pretty amazing.</review>< pics>

If only I didn't end up spending so much dang money every time I walk into IKEA! They're very good at making you realize that you need a lot of different things. Mostly meatball-related things.< /Review>

<Text>Cristian is very rude. The last thing he cares about are customers. It seems that Ikea doesn’t care about their customers anymore to hire a “supervisor” like him. Rude, impolite, unprofessional. I would think more than twice before purchasing from Ikea again because of him.</Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is humongous!!! It's the biggest IKEA I have ver seen. They have everything you can think of. There is ample parking. Both on the IKEA level and underground parking. They have a restaurant inside the IKEA on the second floor which offers a different food menu then other ikeas. Staff is always helpful. Lines move pretty fast.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Omfg this store is huge. I came to Ikea around 8am and was able to get a free coffee. I was goin to get some breakfast but I thought I'll be home and make some cereal and milk and save some money, well do I sure wish I had eaten something, I was at Ikea until 9pm! I was lost for 9 hours and at one point I climbed up the shelves in the market place where all the boxes are and there was a party going on at the very top. There was a bluegrass band from Oklahoma playing and some girl was serving moonshine for everyone. I only had one glass of moon shine and I was fked up. I danced, played, and rolled around like a puppy. A few hours later a really nice man with a long long beard carried me down from the shelves and dragged me to the parking lot and he shoved my lil twerking butt in the car... I woke up the next day hung over af with moonshine vomitt on my Disney princess seat covers, ugh!! Then finally got breakfast. Thank you Ikea! I'll be back next week!<//review><name>Molly The Real Dolly< /name><UserId.>113627339090907624127</UserId.><date>1548790473209< /date></record></dataset><record>

I'm not sure why I love this place.
Its usually crowded here. Although there is enough parking for the entire city of Burbank, it's still hard to find a spot.
I have always wondered if someone needs ambulance how long does it take the EMT's to find you in this maze.< /Text>

Lots of just nobody needs that will be floating in the ocean in 5 years. And it’s packed with shopping zombies. Hideous. Although they do have tasty horse meatballs.</Text>

Went there on may 19, 2018 to the ikea Burbank around 2pm.  Some of the trays and utinsels had food particles it. Cashiers were not friendly. Food was good but I wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen.< /Review>

Great location. Good selection  just like sky other ikea. The food court is great and very clean. Food is great.
Not so great thing are: Staff is a little rude but I guess that's ikea trademark since I noticed that in all of IKEA stores. It is also very crowded. Not sure if it was because of the time we went there or if it always is like that in this location but it was very busy.</Review>

This place is hugeeee! It’s a guilty pleasure of mine to just come on the weekends and walk around for fun. This ikea’s selection is huge! I love the cafeteria the best since it has a nice view out compared to other ikeas. The little market they have on the 1st floor near check out has a big selection as well. Enjoy your walk and take your time :)<//review>

While its an amazing facility it's very difficult to find the self service aisles after #21. Apparently they have a "warehouse" section which is not indicated on any of the signage posted or the ticket item.</text>

<review>Fantastico. This is the largest Ikea in N.A, and it replaced the previous one here in Burbank. It has an amazing selection, unlike the old one, where they showed everything but in one colour only, here, they show all the options. You must stop buy!<//review>< user_id>

Love the new IKEA store.  Much better location, ample parking, insanely large store and shorter lines when you go to check out (even on the weekends) Definitely something to check out if you're in the area.</Text>

Remember to check-in for IKEA Family after the entrance. Great brand for cheap, disposable furniture. If you're looking for real wood that lasts, this probably isn't the store for your but then again, neither is the price bracket.<//text>

The new Ikea has said good bye to older people, or people with disabilities, too large.
I used to go to Ikea  a lot, but now I dread going because of the lay out.

I called to speak to someone at the store. I hung up after 15 minutes. Your call goes to a central call center in a different state. Then based on your zip code they locate a nearby store. Long story short I didn't speak to anyone after wasting 15 minutes of my life.</text>

I want to rate this place "ZERO" stars.  We placed a sizable order in-store with this location.  This was the easy part or so we thought.  Nothing and I repeat nothing was right about any of our order placed by one of their employees.  Secondly, the person at checkout needs to go back to school to learn basic math.  That should have been our sign that problems were to come.  It has now been a HUGE nightmare dealing with this place and quite honestly very surprised that they are even in business.  This is coming from a 52 yr old professional male that is very tolerable, understands some issues can happen and some issues are beyond certain controls.  However, this is nothing short of ridiculous.  I honestly wanted to do business here but NEVER again and I an warning all of my family and friends of the same.  I am on my 5th straight day of going into this store to address issues.  Enough is enough..  I see now I should have cancelled my whole order and called my credit card company to block the funds there and put the stuff on the side of the road for them to pick up at "their" leisure since they are not concerned about this at all...  To add, I am not really a Walmart nor Target shopper but I beginning to believe I could get better results with these types of issues there than dealing with IKEA.

Corporate IKEA needs to look at this location with a fine tooth comb and address employee training and customer service.</text>

Better quality than you'd expect and a current selection of stylish furnishing it's worthwhile to check out the sale and clearance section. Sometimes that's where I start and finish.</Review>

IKEA needs a do over with their staff. What happened to customer service? Not all employees are like that but there are a couple of  apples there.<//text>< GmapID>

<Review>SUGGESTION.   INSTALL A CASHIER if ur customer is buying only 1 item. KITCHEN DEPT.  At least if I am walking around to go to the end  my item will be ready for pick up.  &  I have to go through all the  walking to go to cashier. none of the employees knows the shortcut. & I have to Follow with a lot of items in customers cart, wait for customer problem in the middle of a long line.  INSTALL A 5 ITEMS only CASHIER.  & then I have to go to another pick up section. & wait till my number called.  I have to wait for 30 minutes to have my 1 small item to be ready.  ALSO Maybe add a parking spot for 30 minutes shopper.  There is a LOT of parking space, dedicate to some to your regular customer who knows what they want & already shopping online & just here to pick up.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

It was ok. Seems like the quality has diminished when it was never that great to begin with. Lots of semi-cute junk. Maybe ok for a dorm room. Food area actually looked kind of good though. Swedish meatballs & salmon. Looked pretty yum. Heard people say it was yum but can't personally say.<//text>

Fabulously large and new IKEA. Nice large dining area and plenty of parking. Only complaint is that the WiFi wasn't working when we visited and there's no signal in the lower level without it (which makes it hard to look up related info).<//text>

LOVE Ikea prices, products and I specially love the brand new store in Burbank. It's laid out much better than the prior store easier to find your way around but it's a lot of walking and you have to come prepared for walking.</Text>

Place is a maze! Need signs for checkout exit. Not everybody wants to walk around a rat maze for hours trying to get to the checkout. But I still love this store and the prices are great!<//Review>

Fabulously large and new IKEA. Nice large dining area and plenty of parking. Only complaint is that the WiFi wasn't working when we visited and there's no signal in the lower level without it (which makes it hard to look up related info).< /review>

<Text>Omfg this store is huge. I came to Ikea around 8am and was able to get a free coffee. I was goin to get some breakfast but I thought I'll be home and make some cereal and milk and save some money, well do I sure wish I had eaten something, I was at Ikea until 9pm! I was lost for 9 hours and at one point I climbed up the shelves in the market place where all the boxes are and there was a party going on at the very top. There was a bluegrass band from Oklahoma playing and some girl was serving moonshine for everyone. I only had one glass of moon shine and I was fked up. I danced, played, and rolled around like a puppy. A few hours later a really nice man with a long long beard carried me down from the shelves and dragged me to the parking lot and he shoved my lil twerking butt in the car... I woke up the next day hung over af with moonshine vomitt on my Disney princess seat covers, ugh!! Then finally got breakfast. Thank you Ikea! I'll be back next week!<//Text>< userid>

Over crowded 90% of the time. Rudest Ikea employees I've come across. They have no hesitation in showing you they have no desire helping you. Either with a sigh or some other body language. It's like a store full of bored teenagers except these people are grown.<//review>

I bought four pieces of furniture - well, five actually - over the last week. I think IKEA stuff is fun to build, and when you do it right, feels solid as bricks. Bonus points for småland play, which my child greatly prefers to being lugged around the store with me.<//Text>

<Review>Supposed to be the largest IKEA in North America with the largest warehouse, yet they're still out of stock on multiple items (which I ended up getting at IKEA Covina). And checkout lines haven't gotten any shorter (same with their food court). Lines are still long, the layout of the store is stuffy and cluttered, staff seem stressed. Its only saving grace is ample parking. I expected more.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I never got assistance when purchasing my son's bed, since everything comes in separate boxes, I got Queen instead of full, I look for someone to assist me,  but no one never came. Then when I got home I realized that I also missed a rail for the bed, so I ordered on line and I never got it. When I called them they took 30 min to answer my call, just to tell me that he would have to trasnfer me to another department,  I waited almost 2 hrs and they never answer. Then I tried to call again but the line was busy all the times. I live 2 hours away from the store, otherwise I would have gone in person.  Never thought a big store such IKEA would have  such a terrible customer service. I would never buy from them again.</text>

I love Ikea, but the new building is poorly designed.  The cut throughs to other departments are obscured and are not as logical as the old building.  The parking can also be unnecessarily confusing. On weekends they have orange cones everywhere and workers poorly directing traffic.<//Review>

Horrible customer service and return policy during return. The exact type of customer service you get on returning items as you get in Europe. In other words horrible customer service. Why should someone stand 2 hours in line to return one piece of item, plus get a store credit if you return the item in same condition with receipt. American stores in the US are a million times better than IKEA.<//Text>

IKEA - great for reasonably priced furniture, Swedish meatballs (can't beat the price), and frustratingly confusing aisles to get those furniture items. I love getting things here but I hate the shopping experience, but where else can I get an "EKTORP" or a "BILLY" bookcase for the price? Nowhere.  So IKEA it is.</Text>

<text>I like most of Ikea's  furniture. Some is really cheaply made, but a lot of the stuff is nice and looks good. Very annoyed with them though at this moment because I tried for several hours (on and off) to purchase furniture online and have it set up for pick up the following day - and it was like pulling teeth. The website was super glitchy and kept giving me error messages, despite trying from different browsers/computers. I called them and finally gave up after being on hold for over 30 minutes and not once getting live person on the phone. Get your website together Ikea!!</text>< pictures>

<Review>Two differnt ratings: 5 stars for store, 3 stars for kitchen design service.
In general, I love this place. Lots of furniture, kitchen  cabinets, and cheap food in their restaurant.  However, we sere qiit2e disappointed with their "kitchen design service". It  consists of you doing your own material selection and design first, then paying someone to come measure and use a design tool to show you what it would look like and provide you with a shopping list with prices so you can go purchase your own materials. No such thing as having an experienced designer ADVISE you on what might look good or suggest layouts, color combinations, etc. These folks are just plain sales people out to make a sale, not designers. Very disappointing.</Review>< pictures>

Yes, it is a large place with lots to choose from; luckily there is a returns and exchanges department. I had to return a complete media center, and did so with no issues whatsoever! Absolutely in love with onsite customer service!< /Text>

<Text>Very clean, good prices. The restaurant is inexpensive but delicious.  The giganticness is daunting, but it's nice and the parking is SO much better than the old place.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

After the remodel it will take you a good hour to get through this store if you are speed walking and stop to look at nothing.. Not counting the 20 minutes you stop to eat Swedish meatballs.</Review>

<review>I like the new ikea a lot. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because one of the employs told me I got the wrong cover for a couch and gave me the "correct one". Well I got home and found out I was right he first time, so that meant a second trip.... so get a third opinion next time< /review><Rating>4< /Rating>< Name>

<text>You can't go wrong with a good buy at this place.  There is always something good to buy weather you are looking for something small or something big ikea has it all.   Don't expect to have  something to last a lifetime, keep in mind most items are made from compressed material wich might break easily.  Treat your item accordingly and carefully.

The staff is always helpful and knowledgeable to help people with anything they might need and help you find just what you are looking for.

I often find small things that turn out been very helpful.

The meatballs at the food service area are my favorite< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

It is a huge Ikea.  They have everything you can find online and plenty of parking.  Occasionally hard to track down a human being and the drink machine in the restaurant is almost always out of flavor, but those are minor inconveniences.<//text>

IKEA Burbank doesn't keep their promise. IKEA is a big liar. The service of IKEA is really bad. It offers the worst service you have ever experienced anywhere in the world. What if you have to wait a few days just to get a bed? But be careful when you buy something in IKEA Burbank because it is true. Their delivery service and customer center have a big big problem.<//text>

It is always an adventure in this store. I love dining here and getting my free coffee/tea from my ikea family card. Also, look for deals with the ikea family membership. I got two hundred off a mattress I swear by here. Also, there is a clearance section by the check outs (hidden on the right side) if you're looking for a super deal.<//text>

If you have been to this IKEA before, you know the shortcuts, and they are good to know, since this IKEA is only split in 2 levels. This can be a bother if you aren't looking to explore every section of the store to get to the kitchen accessories.
Other than that, its as easy and annoying to get around, like any other IKEA.
This particular one has an aggravating parking lot that is normally full and full of grumpy locals, me included, trying to find a spot in the multi level structure. Drive slow and don't go here hungry cause it'll make the entire experience worst.
If you buy large items, you will have to park your cart at the exit of IKEA and go get your car to park it in the designated loading lot, which adds to the headache of going to any IKEA, so again, avoid coming here if you are having a bad day.< /text>

<text>Bought a bookcase & had them deliver to my office.  They gave me Sat 1-5pm delivery window.  Around 2:30pm the delivery guys called & said they will be here in 20 minutes.  At 3:40pm I called them, they again said they will be here in 20 minutes.  After 4:30pm they did not answer my calls.

I called Ikea a few times, each time holding more than 30 minutes.  Finally I called Ikea's complain department.  After 90 minutes I got thru.  She told me they will try to deliver it in 20 minutes & that its a third party & there is nothing she can do.  That was at 6:30pm.

Its 7:15 pm now, I have wasted my whole Saturday waiting over 6 ours at my office & there is no sign of the delivery people.  This is the worst delivery I have ever had in my life & I still don't have my bookcase.<//text>< Gmap_id>

The new location is excellent, very easy to get in and out, lots of parking, a much bigger store. It makes for a stress-free experience, compared to the old, crowded location with limited parking. Will come to shop again.</Text>

<review>Great! Loved it!

We spent 5 hours shopping & we loved every minute. Ikea figured out shopping & priced thing's right. The products look well made & Ikea has something for everybody. We ate in the Ikea cafeteria & I was impressed! For $3.99 I had veggie meatballs, served with a grain side dish & vegetables. They also serve their famous Swedish Meatballs, chicken meatballs, salmon, sandwiches, salads & more. Kid's meals were only $2.49 & nothing was over $7.99. I highly suggest you try their Lingonberry soda or something from the soda bar, Ikea soda has 1/2 the sugar compared to one of our sodas. They were all fruit flavored, no caramel color, they were tasty & only a buck, with refills. They even have organic juice boxes. And if you care about eating GMO's, you can rest assured because Ikea brand food is all GMO free (per Ikea company website).

I recommend a trip to Ikea but I highly suggest you allow yourself at least 3 - 4 hours your first time.

I like Ikea!</review></record></dataset><record>

If you have been to this IKEA before, you know the shortcuts, and they are good to know, since this IKEA is only split in 2 levels. This can be a bother if you aren't looking to explore every section of the store to get to the kitchen accessories.
Other than that, its as easy and annoying to get around, like any other IKEA.
This particular one has an aggravating parking lot that is normally full and full of grumpy locals, me included, trying to find a spot in the multi level structure. Drive slow and don't go here hungry cause it'll make the entire experience worst.
If you buy large items, you will have to park your cart at the exit of IKEA and go get your car to park it in the designated loading lot, which adds to the headache of going to any IKEA, so again, avoid coming here if you are having a bad day.< /text>

Massive.  Great value as always.  New floor maps really suck though.  You can't figure out the short cuts.  Probably intentional.< /review>

I have always like this store, now that they move it feels almost the same as the old building, maybe more spacious and the staff always helpful so that's good.</review>

The experience in the cafetorium is quite spectacular too. Remember what a mess it was after the grand opening? Showroom, dining, marketplace, as-is section. That's the routine and now I can do that in this location.

Edit: Upon a visit on the night of 09/12/17, cafeteria workers seemed impatient, unwilling to make eye contact or hand your food to you after ordering. Just a generally unpleasant experience compared to past instances.</text>< Pics>

It's an IKEA. Amusement park for those in search of home furnishings and houseware.
Awesome restaurant with prices that can't be beat. Breakfast for $2.99</text>

The lines to check out are way too long. Getting to the pickup location is crazy. The restaurant is too small and not well laid out. There is no parking nearby. Wait until February and go to the new store. Still in Burbank. It will have its own parking and a huge restaurant.</Review>

< Review>
I wish there was a -5 or a zero stars.  I've gotten smaller orders from Ikea   for years that have gone moderately well, but this past experience was beyond disastrous. The customer service was antagonistic. The process was harmful.  And the systems were non existent.  I was treated as if I wanted something unreasonable.  I just wanted the merchandise that was supposed to be delivered from a warehouse and wasn't delivered. I was setting up a small office and ordered about $14,000 worth of furniture. It was delivered and put into a big pile in one of the open areas of the office and the delivery guy left.  When I looked at the paperwork, I noticed that he had written some numbers next to some items...I checked the box area and it seemed that for 18 desks, I only had legs for 4 desks. I was also missing some doors for some cabinets.  It was hard to see what else was missing since it was all piled up and I couldn't move it. The messed up system in order to get things put together forces the customer to go back to the store and show a receipt that the items were delivered and then they will come and put them together.  I had to go back to Burbank, explain that things were missing...they made me re-buy all the missing items and said when they figured out where everything went, they would refund my money. They gave me a case number and then made me go into the stacks to pull almost 1000 pounds of merchandise and bring it to the register and then to the home delivery area to prep for the guys to deliver and put together for the next day. This took 3 1/2 hours.  The next day when the TFORCE crew arrived with the merchandise, they asked me where the 6 credenzas were.  I thought they were in the pile.  Nope. I tried to call, but no one answers the customer service phones, so I went back to the store again.  3 more hours and I was told that they would order 2 credenzas from another store and send me the 4 they had in the store. This manager refunded the 4500 dollars I spent re-buying everything and also, I was overcharged by 1850 dollars for assembly so I got that refunded as well.  I called for 45 minutes on Friday morning and was told that the credenzas were arriving between 3 and 7.  I waited and at 7 they still didn't show up.  I went back again. Two hours later I was promised again that the 6 credenzas would show up on Monday morning.  I was given 7 extensions to call and promised that they return calls.  On Monday morning, after 45 minutes of calling the 7 extensions,  I got someone on the phone who said that the credenzas would show up between 10 and 2.  at 12:30, TFORCE arrived again...with 4 credenzas.  I tried to call again...I couldn't go back....And it took me about 5 hours of leaving messages and even getting an email saying I would get a call (it never came)  to get someone to give me an answer about the other 2 pieces of furniture.  That person curtly  promised a Tuesday delivery. One Tuesday, the other two pieces finally arrived.  Has your head exploded reading this????The wasted time is insane.  Not once while I was waiting at customer service for the 3 hours did anyone even offer me a glass of water or a one dollar yogurt cone.  I was usually made to feel like I did something wrong and was imposed on them to get my furniture delivered that I paid for.  All in all, never again.  There are plenty of other places I can go for inexpensive furniture and they'll deliver it and assemble it.  Try Wayfair or Hayneedle.< /Review>

<Text>Every Ikea is a mad house. Disneyland version of cheap furniture/home decor shopping. Not very handicap friendly but they do have wheelchairs at the customer service in the front doors. Non-fat vanilla ice cream is probably the best food/snack there! No after xmas sales.< /Text>< pictures>

It's an Ikea. You're either there for a reason, or you're looking to waste a Saturday. Bigger than any Ikea needs to be, but it probably has that thing you saw on the website in stock.<//text>

If you call, you're on hold for 45 min. then you just get tired and hang up.  Very poor customer service.< /review>< Pictures>

This IKEA is huge! Lots of parking available, and the selection is much larger than at the previous location. You feel like you're entering another planet, the IKEA planet, when you go through the parking and enter the building.< /text>

< Review>
First of all i was shocked that there was a picking fee of 30 bucks at the store. Thank God I did all of my self service myself. It was my first experience with ikea. You should have seen the smirk on one of the employee's face when he saw that i have already gathered all of my furniture parts. Second of all home delivery was insanely costly. 60 bucks for nothing even though on ikea site it was said that delivery fee was from 9.99 to 39.99. Unpleasant experience, Robot called me on friday and said that delivery would be from 1 pm to 5 pm on saturday. guess what delivery came at 9 am in the morning when i was not even at home. Very unpleasant experience . I feel ripped off.< /Review>

It is always an adventure in this store. I love dining here and getting my free coffee/tea from my ikea family card. Also, look for deals with the ikea family membership. I got two hundred off a mattress I swear by here. Also, there is a clearance section by the check outs (hidden on the right side) if you're looking for a super deal.<//text>

Everything under one roof. The inexpensive items however are awful quality-wise. You do HAVE to spend no less than $600 if you want quality which is unfortunate.<//text>

This place has everything. Beds with drawers under the mattress, couches that transform into beds, kitchens, office furniture.
If you get hungry from shopping in the thousands of square feet showroom, Ikea cafeteria has a great selection for all, their veggie options are deliscious.</review>

<text>My experience at Ikea in Burbank is that they have nice stuff for most everything's made out of the United States and I'm kind of concerned about that and a lot of this stuff is very cheaply made other than that if you like quick disposable stuff that would be a good place to shop that's my experience 😋< /text><resp>None</resp>< name>

They have a good selection of things and the store is huge! Make sure you know what you are looking for before you arrive. Check out their website and call to ask if the items are available, first. Be prepared to assemble your pieces when you get home.< /review>

IKEA is a cheap furniture store. This store in particular is brand new so it is clean and the items on the sales floor are neatly put. IKEA is still a really boring place that you would not like to spend time in.<//review>

< Review>
UPDATE:

After my bad experience Brandon contacted me, and he kindly explained me that I can get a refund, because delivery company supposed to deliver if there is a representative as mentioned in Delivery Terms and Conditions. Then someone called Maria contacted me by phone, asked me again very nicely; if I would like to reschedule delivery without any extra fee, or cancel and get a full refund. I really appreciate all this effort, Brandon and Maria tried to address the issue nicely and professionally. But to get there I needed to go through a very frustrating week and write a review online. This time I decided to cancel, I still believe there are serious things need to be addressed by IKEA about customer service, very inconsistent behavior. However as a result of getting responsive help at the end, I would like to update my review and rating.

OLD REVIEW:

I went to store and made purchase and requested for home delivery. And I've scheduled it with my apartments management, so they would let the company into my place and assist them until they do their job and sign.
But when the company arrived, they called me they told me that I have to be there for them to get in, and I insist them to let my manager them in, but they didn't accept. I don't have much to do on phone, they just didn't want to get in with the manager. However, Delivery Terms and Conditions clearly states as
"1.3 Who needs to sign for my delivery?
Either you or your representative, that is 18 years of age or older, must be present to receive the merchandise at the agreed upon day and time window." They didn't care.

So after the failure I called the customer service throughout the entire week, and they were keep telling me that they did their part, they attempted but I wasn't there. They don't have any legal and logical argument. They were keep asking for rescheduling with extra fee. At last today I talked to that person called from the store Raul, it was a similar conversation, and I finally cancelled for refund. But they are going to keep the delivery fee, A FEE FOR A SERVICE THAT THEY DID NOT PROVIDE.
It is so unbelievable to me for a person or a company casually holding the money without providing any service.</Review>

<text>Today, It’s been 10 days that I’d returned a couple itens to IKEA.
Belen, a adorable person who helped me with my case told me it would take up to 10 days do get a mailckeck.
When turned 5 days, I decided to call because I know for a fact the lack of customer service IKEA has it and the person who talked to me provided the same information: you’ve to wait 10 days for your mailcheck.
Today, when the 10th day complete, I called to IKEA, talked to MONICA at the administration office and she told me it would take UP TO 4 WEEKS to receive the check. ( FOURS WEEKS ) a completely diferent information those two other employees gave to me.
I asked to speak to a manager but now not regarding my check but the training those people are getting to work there and talk to people giving whatever information comes up in their mind.
I was not surprised anymore by this lack of training, when MONICA - from the administration office, told me she COULDN’T transfer her manager but what she COULD DO is let her know my opinion. Let her know that I was not satisfied with the information that was gave to me.
Really?! Is this real?!
According to MONICA, her supervisor manager is ELZIRA.
So if ELZIRA exists, and if she is Monica’s manager, that’s what I wanted to talk. Is it really worth it sending people to social media to voice out internal issues from the company you are working?!?
IKEA, looking at all the complaints is that what you’re proud of. The way your employees represent you to the world?!?< /text></record>

Walking around the new store doesn't feel as claustrophobic as the old building. They did a great job using the new building's extra space to make the shopping experience more pleasant instead of just cramming more products.<//review>

Store was NOT designed for the level of traffic, be prepared for frustration and anger. Many items were unmarked with NO signage, so you can't know how much most of what you are getting is. You cannot buy the food there without making a special separate trip because it's hidden on the wrong side of the registers.<//Review>

<review>The new IKEA in Burbank, the largest in the US, it is not located at an easy to access location... traffic to arrive to the building is terrifying... and when you arrive you find yourself in a horribly planned parking, plus a horribly organized people trying to control and move traffic around...
It took us about an hour and a half to park, not because there were no free spaces, but because the traffic controllers didn't allow us to reach the plenty of free spaces available.  Instead sending us in traffic loops and useless time wasted behind other cars.
Inside has a nice feeling, HUGE, great eating space (long files also badly controlled and organized)...
We'd have better waited a couple of months until the *novelty* cools off.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I love this place there is a lot of beautiful furniture but the only thing that I don't like is that we have to assemble the furniture ourselves</Review>

I used to shop in IKEA whilst I lived in the United Arab Emirates, so naturally, once I moved to LA I decided to furnish my apartment with the stuff they had here.

They had a wide veriety of furniture and it's all very solid too! I was able to furnish my entire apartment with only furniture from here!

My only complaint would be that theg charge way too much to deliver furniture and assemble it.

9/10, would still buy furniture from them.< /text>

Who doesn't love Ikea? I go all the time, even when I dont need furniture! Speaking of which, that's probably the best place to start. All their furniture is really simple yet beautiful, and cheap! I love all the furniture items I have purchased, and never have had a problem with them. (Despite the assembly, wink wonk.) Another thing I love about Ikea is the fact you can just go their for entertainment, thanks to their display floor. Incase your unfamiliar, the lower floor is a wearhouse, where you pick up the actual furniture, but above they have different house sets displaying how you can use their furniture. It's basically like rooms, and little apartments to walk through. I love this so much. It's always exciting to see. They also have a cafe, and a playroom for kids. Sometimes my mom and I will go walk through the displays and grab a quick, cheap, yet really good dinner in their cafe. Which is my next point. The food their is really affordable, and make solid meals! My mom and I's meal was probably about $20 for veggie meatballs, quinoa, saturated veggies bread, water, and my mom's meal of steak, mashed potatos, veggies, bread, and water. Each meal is hearty, yet well priced. They have a range of food, from their infamous meatballs, veggie meatballs, desserts, soups, salads, and more. You could easily get breakfest, lunch, or dinner there. Overall Ikea has great furniture, nice food, a place for kids, and cool displays. I love that place!</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Today, I purchased a shoulder bag from Burbank IKEA and when I reached the cashier I told her ( she was an old lady called Sandra ) that I nhave a tax exemption card and want to use it . She asked me to go to the row #1, I asked her back what to tell them ? She replied arrogantly and sarcastically: “ tax exemption ! “ and turn hear face whispering “ stupid” ! My wife ,daughter and other two young girls who were so close, got astonished hearing such a thing from the cashier .
I talked to some stuff of the store demanding her to apologise for that impolite behavior, but they refuse to let her do so.
Any way, as a great company and market place,IKEA should not have such un dignified staff onboard.What do the managers of Burbank IKEA think ?< /Text>< Pics>

I ordered the furniture in store 4 days in advance and chose the 10-2 slot time.
I was in an empty apartment waiting on the floor for the furniture to arrive until 7 PM!
I called IKEA 3 times, each time with a wait of 30 minutes and the same response "sorry for the delay. We cannot reach the driver at this time."
They gave me the number of the delivery company, which was just as unhelpful.

People cannot be waiting for 9 hours in an apartment for a delivery whose driver does not even have the decency to pick up the phone and give their status!!!!!!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a</Gmap_id></record>

Bought a drawer set, a vital piece was cut the wrong size and there were several holes that were drilled in the wrong place. It was very sloppily prepared for purchase. Will be returning the item and going elsewhere to purchase a drawer set.<//Review>

<text>BEWARE [[ PLEASE READ..... ]]
First of all IKEA doesn’t even deserve 1 star. Not even a 0..... DO NOT BUY FROM IKEA. We moved to a new apartment and literally bought EVERYTHING from IKEA ONLINE. The whole apartment furniture. When they get here with the delivery they missing the couch, I asked the delivery men about the couch and they seemed lost as if the whole order was complete, I showed them my online order where I had gotten a couch and the name was in the paper but they told it must have been on back order, however this REALLY UPSET ME, as IKEA NEVER emailed, called or text regarding this issue. AND THAT’S NOT ALL!!!  We called 3 days straight and we couldn’t get thru. WE HAD TO DRIVE 1 hour and 45 mins to the closest IKEA in order to speak to someone about the couch. They gave us a (case number) and told us that the couch broke on the way to the delivery and that they were sending a new one within a week. Seven days passed AND STILL NO DELIVERY! We called regarding the case number and still couldn’t get thru.  We had to DRIVE AGAIN back to IKEA with the case number to speak to a manager about the couch, this was 7/20/18 and the manager told us that the delivery was still gonna take 5 days for the delivery on 7/25/18... THAT’S about a month since we made the original purchase. At this point we NO LONGER WANTED THE COUCH.  We requested a refund and the manager told us there’s nothing she can do from the store as it was an online order And THEY COULDN’T GIVE US A REFUND. We said we will not leave the store until we got our refund, that manager then called the store manager, we explained her everything that has happened in details and was told the same thing that they cannot do a refund from the store that it had to be done online or call, we explained to her that we have called numerous time and had been unable to get anyone on the line and when we did get thru the call would hang up, therefore once again we told her that until we get our money back we will not leave the store. She once again tried to talk us off and we had to literally threaten her with suing the company because nothing was being done to solve our issue. Then she said she was going to see what she could do, and now magically she CAN do a refund, but that it was going to be mailed check, we agreed, she sent us to another employee who was going to assist us with this refund, the guy had no idea what he was doing, he was gonna give us another of those (case number) we originally got before and send us home to keep track of it, but that was a no no for us, we then asked him to Call the store manager again and she explained to him a little better, he then gave us a receipt to sign for the refund, and everything ok. The order should be cancelled and we should receive a check by mail. This was 7/20/18.... today 7/25/18 we get the couch that was SUPPOSEDLY CANCELLED. We were not home as we didn’t expect it. And our nice neighbor talked to the delivery guy who told her that if no one received we would have to pay again for delivery and she was nice enough to put it in her garage cause she didn’t know. THIS IS A COMPLETE MESS. We did not sign for that delivery and therefore it should have not been left with someone we did not authorize. What if our neighbors stole the couch?! The delivery company do not know them!(they are very good people actually) We tried calling to send it back and no answer. Also WE STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN OUR REFUND after 5 days....... [[ PLEASE READ ..... DO NOT PURCHASE FROM IKEA ]]  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER had buying something online! Not even with eBay or Craigslist!!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Let me just say that the Ikea experience will never be the same for me. The new building, layout and parking is so extremely customer focused and stress free that getting into the store is a breeze
The floorplan is so much more open and spacious amd much more enjoyable to spend time in< /Text>

<Text>Yep, its huge. But not there is not that much more then a regular store I feel. While its new expect it to be crowded, especially the restaurant.

Tip: There are two lines in the restaurant. Go in and past the drink station and that line will be much shorter.</Text>< Pics>

<text>FRUSTATION!!! is an understatement when I tell you is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to get a real person on the phone when you have a question pertinent to an item you saw on line and like to inquire about it before making a trip to the store, specially if you live 20 miles away.

IKEA customer service is non existent no one EVER answers the phone I waited up to 20 minutes to talk to someone about a piece of furniture I wanted to buy.....a recorded message comes on and it just goes on and on and on forever....

So forget it if you bought something and need to inquire about delivery or anything else IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN YOU WILL DIE OF FRUSTRATION FIRST.....horrible and rude service whats the point of having a phone number on their website is no one cares to ever answer it<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Product selection is okay and the prices are good, but their poor customer service and the terrible delivery service has led me to never want to use Ikea again. Their phone service is especially bad with lots of phone menus, looping recordings, and impossibly long wait times to speak to a human. Don't bother calling if you don't have an unlimited minutes plan.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>i actually come here to buy inexpensive travel accessories. For example those containers that eagle creek luggage sells one can find similar items at a large savings over the eagle creek brand. other travel items i've found inexpensive ponchos, a foldup backpack when i dont need a serious one just need a shoulder bag and frankly i've sometime used it to carry my dslr,  usb outlet chargers for the airport, extension cords</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Finally, I got to see what the hype is all about regarding the largest Ikea store in the nation.

When you drive up to the store, you can tell how massive this store is. It is huge compared to any other Ikea store I have been to. Tons of parking spaces!

However, I was a little disappointed to see that the show room is the same size as the old location. The warehouse area seems to have taken up the bulk of the store.

I was happy to see that the dining area was increased in size with more tables for people to eat at. It's seems to be more cozier unlike the cafeteria style dining area they had at the old location.< /review>

<review>A bit disappointed with the new store. The parking is much better than the previous store, but store is not very impressive. The food area was very disorganized, slow, and the food isn't as good as before. Of course, they still have great prices on home furnishings.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I like this store therre are so many  things that you normally don't see in regular furniture stores. Service desk could have more helping crew, you have to wait for a while. Overall a good experience there.< /Text>

Yep, its huge. But not there is not that much more then a regular store I feel. While its new expect it to be crowded, especially the restaurant.

Tip: There are two lines in the restaurant. Go in and past the drink station and that line will be much shorter.< /Text>

The food court certainly was a huge upgrade from the old one. Many tables and chairs with cafeteria style service. Many crave they meatballs but to me they're meh especially if there's no sauce.
You can spend hours meandering the alleys and you can get a good workout if you're just browsing. Otherwise the furniture themselves are what I categorize as college budget for short term use. They don't seem very durable.
Pros are there's plenty of parking exclusive to this store compared to its previous location.</Review><response>None</response><userid>110354674567407439543< /userid>< date>

With such awful Customer Services IKEA will be eaten up by Wayfair and Huzz. The worst experience imaginable for a 2018 consumer business. Wrong and broken items delivered, it took two hours and fourth minutes for IKEA to answer the phone ----ust to tell me: we cannot help with orders purchased from IKEA store. IKEA BÀAAAÀAÀAÀAD.< /text>

< Review>
I'm not a fan of IKEA due to the setup. I abhor having to go through sections that I dont want to (even with shortcuts) and the customers are awful! I have not been to an IKEA where consumers arent fawning over the furnishings instead of assessing what they may buy.

It's a huge maze of hell when it's full of people. Dont go on the weekend. Avoid the restaurant area if you want to shop. Go eat after or before you shop.

The parking lot is bumper car central and beware of rude drivers. That's anywhere you go but again, avoid this place on the weekend or it'll take an hour to find parking. If you're an aggressive driver this is your place!

What is awesome is the way you pick up your items. You write down the item number and isle then go to the warehouse section and grab it. If that's the standard, my bad, I dont IKEA.

I also liked the parking spots for families and loading. I appreciated that aspect even though the a-holes that dont have babies or "families" take the space.</Review>

FRUSTATION!!! is an understatement when I tell you is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to get a real person on the phone when you have a question pertinent to an item you saw on line and like to inquire about it before making a trip to the store, specially if you live 20 miles away.

IKEA customer service is non existent no one EVER answers the phone I waited up to 20 minutes to talk to someone about a piece of furniture I wanted to buy.....a recorded message comes on and it just goes on and on and on forever....

So forget it if you bought something and need to inquire about delivery or anything else IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN YOU WILL DIE OF FRUSTRATION FIRST.....horrible and rude service whats the point of having a phone number on their website is no one cares to ever answer it< /Text>

<Review>It's a zoo. So large that you can't help but get lost. People camp on the beds and sofas exhausted from searching for the exits. I thought I saw a guy over in one corner cooking a human foot. He had been lost there so long he was forced to cannibalism​.

<Text>I like the store, but the service can be great or awful. Three weeks ago, I spotted a rug, hanging with 5 others of the same kind. After a real quest I finally found a sale associate, who informed me to come back next weekend, because the rugs in display, cannot be sold. The next Saturday I car back, this time only 2 rugs were hanging, conclusion, 4 were sold. This time I felt that I was made fun of, so I ask to speak to a manager, who took 10 minutes to show up. This time I was told that the displays could not be sold on Sunday. We wee a Saturday, following my principle that it is a waste of time to speak with st...d people I left.</Text>< UserId.>

With such awful Customer Services IKEA will be eaten up by Wayfair and Huzz. The worst experience imaginable for a 2018 consumer business. Wrong and broken items delivered, it took two hours and fourth minutes for IKEA to answer the phone ----ust to tell me: we cannot help with orders purchased from IKEA store. IKEA BÀAAAÀAÀAÀAD.<//review>

<UserId.>106741479227321003552< /UserId.>< review>
Tremendous struggle to receive money refund for being billed twice for one item. Make a long story short; it has amounted to two visits to the Burbank store (some forty miles away = 160 total miles = an estimated $30.00 in fuel). The 1-800 number does not have the authority to resolve specific store complaints or even deviate from policy and procedure--which means all cash transaction refunds have to be handle in the original point-of-sale store. But now for whatever reason the corporate call center does not have access to the Burbank store complaints and apparently the Burbank store has never generated a case number (despite my initial visit to fill-out a form as instructed by the 1-800 advisor-and the call center now says that if I want an update on my refund I must return to the store a second time. So in a very real sense to retrieve my $60 plus dollars I have to spend an estimated $30 in gas.
What is maddening about-it-all is that both the store personnel and the corporate call center employees work-off of the identical "word tracks" or "scripts" so it is as if IKEA in its all important quest for efficiency really has become less human and more legalistic and bureaucratic. None of the frontline employees have the authority to do anything where money is concerned--it is always about some unseen entity that cannot be spoken too. In the meantime their famous last words, "We will contact you within 48-72 hours." AGH! I would be willing to believe that if it wasn't for the fact that we are now in the second week.
IKEA is just another corporate identity that sells the myth that it has a soul. This experience has been wasteful, frustrating, wrought with confusion and dead-ends. It is as if I am a thief with a receipt. After a thirty-year relationship that mind you has lasted longer than any single piece of their furniture I am through with IKEA. I hope that bad things happen to IKEA--like horse meat in their meatballs.... oh wait that has already been a scandal in other countries where they operate. They could care less--it is about the bottom line.</review>

Disgusting drop off service.
I ordered the furniture in store 4 days in advance and chose the 10-2 slot time.
I was in an empty apartment waiting on the floor for the furniture to arrive until 7 PM!
I called IKEA 3 times, each time with a wait of 30 minutes and the same response "sorry for the delay. We cannot reach the driver at this time."
They gave me the number of the delivery company, which was just as unhelpful.

People cannot be waiting for 9 hours in an apartment for a delivery whose driver does not even have the decency to pick up the phone and give their status!!!!!!</Text>

Great prices, products, and selection. Sometimes it's hard to find employees for help, but when you do they know what you need. Always very congested though and lengthy waits at the register.< /Review>

Good place for furniture. Bad lilac  of you want to use your cellphone inside. Network coverage on AT&T and T-Mobile is pretty bad. Ikea family members get free coffee.</Text>

Ikea is close to my house. The only problem is the parking. Well looks like they are taking care of that with building a new facility just down the street, bigger and with its own parking structure.< /Review>

<Text>Product selection is okay and the prices are good, but their poor customer service and the terrible delivery service has led me to never want to use Ikea again. Their phone service is especially bad with lots of phone menus, looping recordings, and impossibly long wait times to speak to a human. Don't bother calling if you don't have an unlimited minutes plan.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

In general, Ikea has great style at pretty good prices. However, I'm not in love with this location. The parking situation at Ikea Carson is much better. They also seem to be out of stock more often as well. Could just be that Burbank is a highly populated area. Either way, I still need to go when I need to go and find most of what I need.</review>

Finally, I got to see what the hype is all about regarding the largest Ikea store in the nation.

When you drive up to the store, you can tell how massive this store is. It is huge compared to any other Ikea store I have been to. Tons of parking spaces!

However, I was a little disappointed to see that the show room is the same size as the old location. The warehouse area seems to have taken up the bulk of the store.

I was happy to see that the dining area was increased in size with more tables for people to eat at. It's seems to be more cozier unlike the cafeteria style dining area they had at the old location.< /Text>

<review>I love and hate you Ikea.  I go in for 1 thing and love the rest and end up staying 2xs longer.
1 thing,  if you are injured and can't walk around a lot make sure you have a wheelchair.   There is a ton of walking to get to what you need.< /review>< UserId.>

<Text>The Burbank Ikea is the closest earthly replication of Purgatory that you're likely to come across. Your visit begins by parking in a featureless parking garage with few unique identifiers to help you find your car later. You don't know it yet, but after a day of endless wandering, this will be the part that crushes your hopes when you finally escape.

You enter the store and ascend an escalator from which there is no return. Wave goodbye to your last glimpse of the rest of the world. There is no telling when you'll see it again.

You proceed forward with visions of purchasing some affordable household items. However, you quickly become lost moving from endless  parts of rooms. After turning and turning, unable to find the thing that you were looking for, you find a map. The map suggests an exit is right around the corner.

The map is misleading. Your exit was only another 3/4 room with sensible curtains on a fake window. Sure, you've taken a "shortcut", but it only leads to more departments.

Hours go by. You slowly come to terms with the fact that you will never escape. You live here now, but at least there are many things to sit on.

After an indeterminate time, you finally begin to see signs for the cash registers. Hope swells as your journey is finally coming to an end. You round the corner and see what feels like hundreds of registers. Your hopes are dashed as you realize these registers each have dozens of people in lines that are barely moving.

You pick a line behind a man who seems to be furnishing a hotel with this single Ikea trip and wait. And wait. The line barely moves. (I literally sat in line for 90 minutes).

Finally, you  reach the register and pay for the 4 items you actually wanted to buy but can no longer recall why. You shuffle out with dozens of other disgruntled shoppers who look like they survived a recent trauma.

As you round the corner, you are faced with the escalator once again. "Leaving so soon?" it seems to ask as you quicken your pace to walk back towards the parking garage.

Entering the parking garage, you realize that Ikea's final trap is sprung. You have no idea where you parked and everywhere looks the same.

After 20 minutes, you finally find your car, stow your purchases, and climb into the driver seat. You are in a state of shock resembling Captain Phillips at the end of the movie.

It's ok to cry a little.

tl;dr - The prices may be low, but the cost is higher than you think< /Text>< pictures>

Start at Gordon Biersch just down the street from Ikea. Have some of their amazing appetizers and a few beers. Now head to Ikea and enjoy the circus. After abkut 15 minutes of walking, you will probably be in the chair area. They have a very comfy chair called Poang. Sit down get comfy and people watch. It. Is sort of an upscale 'people of Walmart' experience.<//review>

Strange way to park. You need to park at a far parking lot (Which seems like belong to a different place), and to walk to IKEA. Make no mistakes, there is no parking lot attached to this location.
After all, it is an ordinary IKEA, nothing that you will not place at your friends home ;)< /Review>

It's absolute chaos in this store at all hours of the day.

I really like the furniture from IKEA, don't get me wrong! It's stylish, affordable, and looks good in the home (after the obligatory assembly!)

But this store, is just an absolute nightmare when it comes to navigation. The showroom, warehouse, home supplies shop, and even food court are just a nightmare. There's at least a thousand people in here all day every day. If you need just one or two things, don't expect it to be a quick 15 minute trip to IKEA. The store is designed to keep you in there as long as possible, and so that you walk by as much merchandise as possible.

If you plan on coming here, just make sure you give yourself 1-2 hours, and you have a friend to help you load your boxes in the car. Parking and loading is absolute chaos.< /text>

<username>Cary Brown<//username><Review>Ikea is Ikea. Be prepared for a walk.  A long Serpentine path leads you through a collection of cleverly designed rooms. All the extras are available, lighting fixtures, shelving, kitchen accessories, art, hardware and of course, furniture.  Suprisingly, the cafeteria is very good. Try the vegan Swedish Meatballs. Easy underground parking is a couple of hundred feet away. Elevator and escalators are available.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>We purchased our kitchen counters from Ikea and were promised delivery within 2-3 weeks of having our template made  Apparently they are having trouble with their fabricators because I just got an email saying they are 6 WEEKS behind schedule. I only found this information out because I doggedly hounded the company  IKEA has done absolutely NOTHING to compensate us for this completely unsatisfactory service.

<review>Ahhhh what a nightmare of place
Line took over 25 minutes with a very unpleasant cashier with bad attitude
And worse if all I purchased an item from West Covina branch of Ikea for $14.99 on sale came to Burbank and had to pay double $29.99 since they are not the same (dose it even make sense)<//review>< Rate>

Tremendous struggle to receive money refund for being billed twice for one item. Make a long story short; it has amounted to two visits to the Burbank store (some forty miles away = 160 total miles = an estimated $30.00 in fuel). The 1-800 number does not have the authority to resolve specific store complaints or even deviate from policy and procedure--which means all cash transaction refunds have to be handle in the original point-of-sale store. But now for whatever reason the corporate call center does not have access to the Burbank store complaints and apparently the Burbank store has never generated a case number (despite my initial visit to fill-out a form as instructed by the 1-800 advisor-and the call center now says that if I want an update on my refund I must return to the store a second time. So in a very real sense to retrieve my $60 plus dollars I have to spend an estimated $30 in gas.
What is maddening about-it-all is that both the store personnel and the corporate call center employees work-off of the identical "word tracks" or "scripts" so it is as if IKEA in its all important quest for efficiency really has become less human and more legalistic and bureaucratic. None of the frontline employees have the authority to do anything where money is concerned--it is always about some unseen entity that cannot be spoken too. In the meantime their famous last words, "We will contact you within 48-72 hours." AGH! I would be willing to believe that if it wasn't for the fact that we are now in the second week.
IKEA is just another corporate identity that sells the myth that it has a soul. This experience has been wasteful, frustrating, wrought with confusion and dead-ends. It is as if I am a thief with a receipt. After a thirty-year relationship that mind you has lasted longer than any single piece of their furniture I am through with IKEA. I hope that bad things happen to IKEA--like horse meat in their meatballs.... oh wait that has already been a scandal in other countries where they operate. They could care less--it is about the bottom line.</Text>

IKEA is kind of like a theme park: A labyrinth of oddities and adventures with rambunctious children and impossible-to-find restrooms. It even has theme park food. You know what I'm talking about; it looks and smells incredible, but it turns out to be painfully mediocre. But at least here, it's reasonably priced. And really, that sums up a lot of IKEA's furniture, too. Still, it's kinda fun to just wander around and play in fake kitchens, and despite the common perception, not all of their stuff is complete crap. I must confess to owning a couple dressers and desks myself, and they've held up pretty well. So if you have a Sunday to burn (or a significant other who loves (500) Days of Summer), you should check it out!< /review>

<review>The prices are amazing, but it's incredibly maze like and you should come in with the idea that you will be here for a few hours. Wear sneakers if you can; you will be walking miles.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a< /gmapID></record>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>IKEA is kind of like a theme park: A labyrinth of oddities and adventures with rambunctious children and impossible-to-find restrooms. It even has theme park food. You know what I'm talking about; it looks and smells incredible, but it turns out to be painfully mediocre. But at least here, it's reasonably priced. And really, that sums up a lot of IKEA's furniture, too. Still, it's kinda fun to just wander around and play in fake kitchens, and despite the common perception, not all of their stuff is complete crap. I must confess to owning a couple dressers and desks myself, and they've held up pretty well. So if you have a Sunday to burn (or a significant other who loves (500) Days of Summer), you should check it out!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

This is a great Ikea, although crowded.  The one drawback is that can't push your shopping cart to your parked car.  If you have too many items to cary, you have to pull your car around to a loading area, which is sometimes congested.<//text>

But avoid picking up large furniture from the loading bay because everyone will be there or you'll be stuck in a car cue with everyone else. At least order some 50 cent hot dogs before you line up with the other cars to pass the time and avoid the stress.</text>< gmapID>

even though they're open until 7:00 p.m. today Tuesday they decide to close returns at 3:00 p.m. just because they feel like it.

<Review>It's like a homewares exhibition at the Staples Center met the huge Costco portrayed in Idiocracy, and then they ate each other. For all the aggravation parking and queuing you might as well go to Disneyland for the day.

Perhaps it would have made more sense to simply build a Westside-friendly location in Sherman Oaks instead of this gargantuan temple of literally all things Swedish department store, but I trust the IKEA brain trust had good reasons for supplanting the old Burbank location (located conveniently across from a Barnes and Noble, in the event you wanted some books for your Billy case).</Review>< date>

Check your receipt for every item, before leaving the store.

1.with furniture delivery, i also paid for old couch pick up as well. waited all day, no one showed up, took me so many waitings nd phone calls to finally get the refund. they never pick up the phone. no one knows whats going on or what to do.

This is a great Ikea, although crowded.  The one drawback is that can't push your shopping cart to your parked car.  If you have too many items to cary, you have to pull your car around to a loading area, which is sometimes congested.<//Review>

Check your receipt for every item, before leaving the store.

1.with furniture delivery, i also paid for old couch pick up as well. waited all day, no one showed up, took me so many waitings nd phone calls to finally get the refund. they never pick up the phone. no one knows whats going on or what to do.

2. bought some stuff, i checked the receipt for each. found out they overcharged me. had to wait in line to get a refund. no appologies.

3.bought bunch of stuff, nd got them delivered. two closets were sent instead of one. had to somehow get hold of them on the phone, arranged pick up nd a refund. 2 weeks later, still no refund. calls again, operator says they already processed a refund and that there is absolutely nothing they can do more for me, told me to come down to all the way to burbank store again.

i've been renovating my kitchen lately which resulted in going to ikea around 7 times so far lol ... what i found pretty amazing during those trips was how well informed the staff is. i would ask someone working at the first floor pick-up section for $3 kitchen hooks and they could tell me right away that i had to go to the top floor for that. the answer came to quickly that i was really skeptical how they can know about $3 hooks being surrounded by thousands of different items ... but so i went upstairs and there they were - $3 kitchen hooks just like advised. i had that happen with several other items. every time i was pretty blown away ... i think that type of service is only possible when the staff stays at a given place for longer ... so i guess they must treat the employees pretty well. i hope so anyway.<//Text>

The worst ikea I've been to. Waited over an hour to return one tiny item and all the staff doing returns were rude to every guest and seemed like they hated their life. If you hate your job, get a new one. Will never come back to this location.</Text>

Im an Ikea noob so it was an amazing ecosystem i walked into in this place. $2 meals and furniture? Im surprised its not just swarming with bums and junkies all day long. Bought the sleeper sofa and got it delivered and assembled no problems. Great business.< /text>

< review>
I recently posted a review about the store and I gave it 4 stars. Now that I had to deal with their costumer service I have to say they don't even deserve 1 star. I made an order online, where they charged me 100 dollars for the delivery in 9 days, which I thought was excessive but since going to the store was very difficult for me at the time and I needed the things I bought urgently, I accepted. Turns out they rescheduled my delivery on their own for another 12 days, so I would have to wait 21 days to get my stuff after paying 100 dollars. And this is where the nightmare started. Calling the ikea costumer service is impossible! There is a recording lying to you the whole time saying that your call is important which obviously isn,t! After calling 5 different times and waiting (and I promise I am not exaggerating) more than 1 hour every call for them to answer, they still haven't resolved my issue. In the end I had to call my bank and they cancelled the payment because the ikea costumer service is THE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE IN THE WORLD!

IF YOU ARE BUYING IN IKEA MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT RETURNING YOUR ITEMS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY MAKE SURE YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE NEED TO CALL THEM, BECAUSE THE TIME SPENT ON THE PHONE JUST WAITING FOR THEM TO ANSWER AND THEN NOT TO RESOLVED YOUR PROBLEM WILL SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF YOU!!!!

Below my previous comment:

The good: Very large store with tons of choices for your home. Overall quality of most items ranges from okay to excellent and prices are pretty reasonable, there are some hidden treasures for very low prices. I would specially recommend the fabric area where you can find all sorts of linens and bedding stuff of very good quality and very competitive prices.
We were able to go inside with our companion dog with no problem. I saw other people holding small dogs with no service vests, so although the sign at the door says only for service animals I guess it is okay if you have a small dog.
The bad: there are few bathrooms that are very spaced out throughout the store, make sure to pee when you enter because it will be a while until you find another bathroom. Also the food area is bigger that other Ikea stores but very few people serving, so very long lines... even after a very long walk throughout the store my husband gave up on having a snack due to long and slow lines...
Why not 5 stars: while some of the staff was nice and helpful, majority of time they will say you need to return to the specific location of the item and ask someone there, i.e. If you see a sofa that is in display further down, you need to return to the sofa area for someone to help you. Some of the staff had very dismissive attitude.</review>

It's an enormous Ikea, apparently the largest in North America.  Parking is complicated and can be a bit of a nightmare, but the cafeteria is huge and a great deal.</review>

<Review>It's amusing, and oddly comforting to see how much the American middle class embraces the Swedish Social Democratic aesthetic of Ikea. The company for all its laughable idiosyncrasies, is still a case study of the power of incremental improvement and scalability clearly on view in a well-run, fair-minded business.<//Review>< pictures>

Ikea restaurant in Burbank refused to give me kid's meal, asked me for the baby to be present....!!! in order to give me the meal.  Baby was sick in the car with his Dad, called his dad to bring the sick baby to the restaurant, the cash register did not apologize and threaten will call the police. is this how they train Ikea STAFF..........? You never can call Ikea store for any reason, you can only call the call center ( How come Ikea is not in the top 10 most hateful corporation ...? )   We are taking a legal action. we contact an attorney, there is no such a law that baby should be present in order to get a kid's meal in State of California< /Text>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>It's amusing, and oddly comforting to see how much the American middle class embraces the Swedish Social Democratic aesthetic of Ikea. The company for all its laughable idiosyncrasies, is still a case study of the power of incremental improvement and scalability clearly on view in a well-run, fair-minded business.<//Text>< Pics>

<gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a<//gmap_id><review>Ive been here a handful of times and this ikea has gotten a bigger store and awhole new upgrade its a pretty interesting store. Design as a maze to make you wander and forget what you needed to buy and come out with a big ol furniture set. And since its a bigger place you can get lost but theres always signs to where the exit points you to. But its ikea being lost means having an adventure. My favorite thing is this store has a bunch of furniture from bath to bedroom to patio and etc and its for a super affordable price that no place can beat. Its a trip how you can literally be here the whole day as well without even knowing since theres so much to look at. Also the cafeteria here has the best swedish meatballs ever and swedish chocolate cake can never go wrong with just stopping by and just eat at ikeas cafeteria.</review><rating>5< /rating>< pictures>

Decent, cheap furnishings for the home. Like how they stage things so those of us without design skills can still match things.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Modern simplicity with a swedish touch. This new ikea dwarfs a home depot or lowes in size. This store is HUGE! Ikea knows how to display their wares in a way for it to seem like a stroll on a path. They have a small grocery store stocked with swedish favorites, a cafeteria upstairs that serves quality swedish food at atonishingly low prices (2 dollar breakfast plate) and a place to buy hot dogs and other american staples like soft serve ice cream. Even the soda they have available is all swedish, one of them named as "nordic sparkling pear".</review>< pics>

We made an order at Ikea Burbank on Sunday March 5. They didn't have one item in stock and said that they can deliver everything at once with that item only on March 13. Now that we got the delivery this item was still missing, and nobody informed us that it'll be missing. And it's totally our problem so we should call ourselves and deal with it.
I spent 25 minutes on hold just to suddenly get disconnected. Then I spent other 30 more minutes on hold to hear that somebody else from Ikea will contact me within 72 hours to deal with this issue and schedule the re-delivery.
I didn't hear back form them and called again on March 20 and found out that nothing has still been done on the issue. This time the operator assured me somebody will contact me within 3 days, and guess what ... nobody did, of course. So when I called again today, March 28, the lady hanged up in 5 seconds just because she couldn't hear me clearly when I was trying to find a spot in my apartment where the connection would be better. And this is after 30 minutes of holding! Since I can't contact them through phone (nor it gives any result), I tried to write them an email or their website, and their online form doesn't work! So that's it, no way to contact Ikea. Fantastic.
What am I supposed to do? Call and stay on hold for other 30 minutes hoping I will finally get some result? Horrible service!
The delivery guys themselves were good, but the whole impression is spoiled completely.</Text>

It is now confirmed for me. Will never step foot in an IKEA store again. We were setting my daughter up in an apartment in Burbank after driving from Chicago. Was buying an entire apartment full of furniture for a one bedroom. Despite several conversations about the pieces she was choosing, and being told over the phone everything would be available...about20% was available when we arrived. They tried to send us to their two other Socal locations....we ditched the entire place and gave her business to a small furniture store in Covina. We bought everything at 4pm and they delivered it to her door by 6pm the same night. This was a typical Ikea experience from what I have read.</text>

It's okay. It's just okay. Lots of blue. I don't know, things just seemed like the quality of workmanship didn't deserve 5 stars.</review>

by the recording, you get another recording telling you that
the store is closed. Of course is this also a blunder, because I am
calling during the stated business hours. Then to add to the stupidity,
I get disconnected. I do hope this inefficiency doesn't extend to ikea's
entire product line.              thank you, but who do I call now, Sear's ?<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I adore Ikea's products, but trying to get help in this store is like getting a tooth pulled. I wanted to buy a bathroom sink and for this product I needed an employee, and there is no one is sight. I walk to the end of this floor and ask someone in the garden area and she tells me she can't help me, and that I need someone from the bathroom department. So I start back, past the bathroom and to the beginning of this giant floor space and there are 2 of them sauntering along together. When it appears that you only have 3 people working on a floor, these 3 people should be spread out on said floor...not bunched together...ever. They call for help...and here is a new person that I somehow missed in my search ...so they have 4 people working on this floor that I can attest to. Then let's talk about their pick up area...Jesus, Mary and Joseph....they have NO parking lot of their own so you have to park across the street in the mall parking structure  (if there are any places left). They didn't want me taking their cart to the parking structure so I had to go get my car (because I had so many purchases I had made the 40 mile drive to IKEA in our Suburban...not an easy car to drive). Following the path I entered the parking structure I drive out of it onto a one way street where I can only go right (IKEA is directly across the street from me now, but there are 2 one way streets with a street divider down the middle) to a T intersection that has a no U-turn sign...well somehow I have to get on that street going back towards IKEA, so I either have to go right or left, and turn around and come back so I can enter IKEA's pick up area, and do that while navigating the thousands of IKEA customers and mall customers who have the right of way. W-T-H? I love, love, love their products and I heard they are building a new one in an area not as congested, but I won't be back until they do.< /Review>

I personally don't love IKEA I believe it's hell hidden in a department store. They trap you in the store forcing you to walk endlessly in circles to get to the endpoint. Then you have to wait in the line. Can anyone say Anxiety Attack?</text>

A nightmare to traverse. Always crowded, super long lines, and forget loading your car in a timely manner -especially because the jerk in the VW Bettle is trying to fit 18 boxes into the non existent trunk thereby backing up anyone's chance at doing what they intended to do. The selection is massive but managing atriums the patrons is difficult at best. We always go and then come home and order online for delivery to my house.<//Text>

<text>It was very confusing navigating around.  Can easily get lost.  It's like a casino in Vegas! That's what I thought.

If I had alot mire money, I'd buy one of those tables that you can move up and down as a craft table!<//text><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a</GmapID>< name>

<rating>4</rating><text>Finally went early enough to try out IKEA's breakfast. I had the big breakfast (sans meat, and they actually gave me extra hashbrowns!). The eggs were salty but for $1.99 for a plateful of food, I couldn't complain.

Once I was carbed up it was time to enter the maze of IKEA. I usually keep an eye out for yellow sale tags. And also don't forget to visit the As-is section to the right of the registers! It's slightly hidden out of the way. Good deals can be found here!</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We just spent 30 mins trying to get into this new place...they have parking "guides" that literally guided us to thw exit. You have to drive all the way around the structure to park. Me & my family will never be returning to this location. It was a huge waste of our time. If you decide to go, go when they first open as this place was PACKED today!!!< /text>

<name>Armen Aramis<//name>< review>
I bought 5 kitchen cabinets, everything was designed online in their computer, printed out right in store. it is saved in their system all parts I ordered in my username the lady from the store created. It was given to them to get parts to assemble, and payment was done by credit card. Only one of 5 cabinets they gave was correct. Today I went to exchange get new parts assuming that they have all info, and they are saying - "you have to give us the receipt or no exchange. The what is my credit card printout? What is the stuff in their computer still saved? Who does that? Does Home Depot, Lawes or other place does it? When does the customer prmise or guarantee that just because they may lose a piece of paper they have to pay all labor for showing up (5 people), and throw away thousands of dollars to the wrnog furniture? Is this what they do in Sweden?  It's not even return - but exchange. I paid by credit card, paid extra $200 to labor for wrong assembly. this is not just ridiculous this is absurd.</review>

< Review>
Dont shop at Ikea.  They dont offer spare parts. The customer service rep actually told me to look on ebay. Not even a year having the bed and the so called "wood" just snaps. Sure wont be spending any more money there.<//Review>

<review>It's just too big and too confusing the parking is wonky even though they have parking attendants to help you the place is just too big so if you like that I guess you'll love Ikea but my wife and I were just like this is too much it's just too big but that's subjective and I'll leave that to you it's Ikea they have the same stuff that they've always had just a bigger warehouse and a bigger show floor< /review>< Pics>

It is your typical Ikea but parking is a bit of a pain if you need to take anything home. The loading area requires you to get your car out of the parking structure, drive around, show your receipt then fight for a spot. The weekends can be miserable so I'd suggest going during the week if you can.</text>

It was given to them to get parts to assemble, and payment was done by credit card. Only one of 5 cabinets they gave was correct. Today I went to exchange get new parts assuming that they have all info, and they are saying - "you have to give us the receipt or no exchange. The what is my credit card printout? What is the stuff in their computer still saved? Who does that? Does Home Depot, Lawes or other place does it? When does the customer prmise or guarantee that just because they may lose a piece of paper they have to pay all labor for showing up (5 people), and throw away thousands of dollars to the wrnog furniture? Is this what they do in Sweden?  It's not even return - but exchange. I paid by credit card, paid extra $200 to labor for wrong assembly. this is not just ridiculous this is absurd.<//review>< time>

It is your typical Ikea but parking is a bit of a pain if you need to take anything home. The loading area requires you to get your car out of the parking structure, drive around, show your receipt then fight for a spot. The weekends can be miserable so I'd suggest going during the week if you can.< /review>

1st time here. Whomever manages the front end of the store should be replaced! Only 8 out of 30 registers open on a Saturday. Ridiculously long lines!!!<//Text>

Worst delivery system. Delayed my furniture twice. Even when you want to reschedule you’ll be put on a waitlist for at least 2 hours. Never order online !!!< /Review>

No better than any other Ikea despite the hype when it was built. Staff seemed overwhelmed, customers were rude and check out was ridiculous - a hundred plus customers wanting to purchase and lanes were closed, workers turning off their lights and going to break. I left my items and walked out of the store. I have no interest in ever visiting this location again.< /review>

IKEA closed down the old Burbank site and reopened a newer larger one just a few blocks down. This place is massive and is the biggest store in the region. Parking is a little crazy and is reminiscent of the city-like Disneyland parking.<//Review>

A standard ikea, the parking situation is really frustrating though.  There's only a small area for loading and unloading, and it frequently has a long line.  When I was there it took 45 minutes to get my items in my car.<//text>

The parking lot attendants put out cones to redirect you in and out so if you're coming from 1st, you have to go all the way around. Plus, the cafeteria line is way too long.< /text>

My husband hates that. So do l.  And they don't have enough people on the floor to show you the short cuts.<//review>< pics>

Don't buy stuff there. I spend 1k there, drove 60 miles back and forward because all items were damaged and had wrong parts. They exchanged it and the next set also came defective. Place sucks. Manager gave me 20$ cash for gas... That's why I gave it one star. If it wasn't for 20$ I d give it 0 stars. F**k ikea!!!< /Review>

While I'm sure many people like Ikea, I find it just really crappy quality and it feels dirty and gross there.</Review>

They make this place a maze on purpose. Impossible to get out of and the cashiers aren't friendly.< /text>

Black Friday and they have 11 of 30 cashier stations open.  Came in for six items but four are “temporarily unavailable” (light bulbs?).  Did no one plan for the post-Thanksgiving rush?</review>

<Review>Dont ever buy here if you thinking about the option to return the product.
They let me wait there over an hour in the return department.
They will try to break you so you will just leave without returning the product.
The worst costumer care ever< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I find that Ikea was a extremely large Place extremely large store not understanding how to get where you want to go how to pay where you when you want to pay and how to stop . Getting directions from the employees that work there is very very hard to understand everybody says it's just a little bit of head but you don't know which way to go and there's so many ways to go...</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a< /GmapID></record>

Horrible parking. Not enough parking to support the store of this size.</review>

< review>
Really Disappointed in my recent visit,, not as many fun gadgets,and ,, I am pissed off at you guys,, I bought a PRODUKT stir stick thingy,, not seeing that you have to buy their battery to make it work,, I am a hundred mies away,, why don't you include your battery so we figure out that you can't buy them anywhere but from you,, and the same is with the lights,, you have to buy the bulbs from them ,and the cords,, all sold separately ,,,, and if you live far away it is not practical,, shame on you IKEA for making your products too dependent on your supplies< /review>

<Review>Horrible delivery service. My advice to anybody is that  if you are purchasing a large item that needs to go by truck, go somewhere else. Customer service sucks. They are late, communication is a big problem and there is no way you can track your order, no link that works.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The most frustrating IKEA in southern California! You have to wait forever in your car to get to the loading zone. You can't take carts out to the parking garage to load. Make the trip out to another IKEA.</text>

Understaffed, the parking lot is absolute stupidity. Problems dealing with customer service...after being interrogated by security before even getting into the parking lot its too much. Not even close to what I would call a pleasant shopping experience, won't be returning.<//Text>

worst customer service, bought $5000 worth of kitchen cabinets. Wrong things we're delivered and ordered and then you can't get a hold of anyone to speak to about it. Never going there again< /review>

<text>Don't buy stuff there. I spend 1k there, drove 60 miles back and forward because all items were damaged and had wrong parts. They exchanged it and the next set also came defective. Place sucks. Manager gave me 20$ cash for gas... That's why I gave it one star. If it wasn't for 20$ I d give it 0 stars. F**k ikea!!!< /text>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) They have very good things and very beautiful and not so expensive, but they don't have anything in stock I wanted to buy a mattress and they didn't have it because since they didn't have it, I wanted to buy a piece of furniture for clothes and they didn't have it either, they don't have many things available. warehouses look empty. And the photos are of what I wanted to buy.

(Original)
Tienen muy buenas cosas y muy bonitas y no tan caras, pero no tienen nada en stock quise comprar un colchón y no lo tenían pues ya que no lo tenían quise comprar un mueble para la ropa y tampoco lo tenían, no tienen muchas cosas disponibles los almacenes se miran vacíos. Y las fotos son de lo que quise comprar.</Text>

The only detail I would put in is the way the store is designed, it is like a maze and if you suffer from claustrophobia, it could be a challenge to find your way out and reach a moment of anxiety.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Good store, with a lot of items for the whole home ... and the best its prices ... quite good ...
The only detail I would put in is the way the store is designed, it is like a maze and if you suffer from claustrophobia, it could be a challenge to find your way out and reach a moment of anxiety.

(Original)
Buena tienda,con gran cantidad de artículos para todo el hogar...y lo mejor sus precios...bastante buenos ...
El único detalle que pondría,  es la forma en que está diseñada la tienda, es como un laberinto y si sufres de claustrofobia, podría ser un desafío el encontrar la salida y llegar a un momento de ansiedad..</Text>< user>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) If you want to save and buy a lot of furniture - you here!) But we must understand that this furniture is "disposable", that is, it is not strong and is not intended for relocations.
A lot of everything you need, dishes, protective gadgets, so that children do not get hurt about corners, etc., you can hang for a whole day.
But if you like the designer or you want to calm your nerves or vice versa, then go ahead)

Если хочется сэкономить и купить много мебели - вам сюда!) Но надо понимать, что эта мебель «одноразовая», то есть не отличается прочностью и не предназначена для переездов.
Множество всего нужного, посуда, защитные прибамбасы, чтоб дети не покалечились об углы и тд, можно зависнуть на целый день.
Но если нравится конструктор или хочется нервы успокоить или наоборот, то вперёд)</Text>< Pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>(Translated by Google) It's Saturday, so the queue is very long...
ㅠㅠ gave up in the middle and came back (July 18th)

Three weeks ago, I tried again yesterday (August 8th) of my IKEA shopping, which I had given up because of a long queue and intense California sunlight.

In order not to repeat the humiliation that I gave up on July 18th, I hurried off with my wife at home in East LA, and after picking up an acquaintance from Koreatown.
Arrive at the IKEA BURBANK store at around 10:30 am..
Parked in the underground parking lot and came out to the ground
The waiting line for the store entrance lined up under the unchanging intense sunlight ...ㅠㅠ
There are still about 20 minutes left until 11 o'clock, the store opening time, but a long waiting line filling the ground parking area at Kuyeokku Station...

Admission begins around 11 o'clock, and finally, the time to enter the store is around 11:40.
After arriving and waiting for more than an hour, entering the store is successful. ㅠㅠ

If you are planning to do IKEA weekend shopping,
It is recommended that you prepare drinking water, sunglasses, a hat, etc., keeping in mind the long waiting time in the hot sunlight for at least an hour or more...
(At the outdoor store between the store entrance and the waiting line, IKEA sold 1 500ml bottled water at room temperature for $1, and the refrigerated one for $8.)

Presumably, as of yesterday (Saturday, August 8th), you should arrive at IKEA at least 1 hour before 10 a.m. on the weekends, the store opening time, to avoid the hot sunlight under the shade tent.

토요일이라 그런 지 대기줄이 엄청 기네요....
ㅠㅠ 중간에 포기하고 돌아 왔습니다.(7월18일 )

3주전, 엄청 긴 대기줄과 강렬한 캘리포니아의 햇빛에 질려 포기하고 말았던 IKEA 쇼핑을 어제 (8월 8일) 재도전했습니다.

7월18일 포기했던 굴욕을 반복하지 않기 위해 East LA의 집에서 와이프와 조금 일찍 서둘러서 출발하고,  한인타운에서 지인 한 분 Pickup 후
IKEA BURBANK 매장에 도착한 시간은 오전 10시 30분 경..
지하주차장에 주차하고 지상으로 나와보니
변함없이 강렬한 햇빛아래 길게 늘어 선 매장입장 대기줄 ...ㅠㅠ
아직 매장 오픈시간인 11시까지는 약 20여분 정도가 남았는데 꾸역꾸역 지상 주차구역위를 채워가는 기나긴 대기줄...

11시 경 부터 입장이 시작되고 결국 매장에 입장한 시간은 11시 40분경입니다.
도착하고 1시간이상을 대기한 끝에 매장입장 성공입니다. ㅠㅠ

혹시라도 IKEA 주말쇼핑을 예정하고 계신 분은
최소한 1시간 혹은 그 이상 뜨거운 햇빛 아래서 기나긴 대기시간을 염두에 두시고 마실 물과 선그래스, 모자 등 준비하시는 걸 추천 드립니다...
(매장입구 와 대기줄 사이의 옥외매대에서 IKEA측은 상온 상태의 500ml 생수 1개에 $1, 냉장시킨 것은 3개에 $8에 팔고 있었습니다. )

추측컨데, 어제 (8월8일 토요일) 기준으로 주말에는 매장오픈 시간인 오전 11시에서 적어도 1시간전인 10시쯤에는 IKEA에 도착하셔야 그나마 그늘천막 아래서 뜨거운 햇빛을 피해 입장을 기다릴 수 있을 것 같네요.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMn4LJKX-yyA98MK_yMkAIQWbVTreM1_1Bglj4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29545037103ff:0xdb7bbf19e31c916a< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) There is a waiting for any day, not just the weekend.
But wait a moment and you can get in.
Compared to other places, this place has a scale and there are no products.
For those who are waiting, we have also set up an athletic meet.
Conclusion: The inconvenience of waiting is minimal and I like this one.

주말만 아니라 어느 날이라도 기다림이 있습니다.
그러나 잠시만 기다리면  들어 갈수 있습니다.
다른곳 보다 여기가  규모도 있고 제품도 없는것이 없더군요.
기다리는 사람들위하여 운동회 탠트도 쳐 놓았습니다.
결론 : 기다림 의 불편함이 최소 이고 여기가 가장 좋아요.< /text>

(Translated by Google) It's great you can eat inside the store and if you liked it at the exit you can buy products in the line of boxes to prepare that food at home.
One week it would take me to build all my house there, because there is everything!

(Translated by Google) It is a good place to see things for the home, the prices are not high, but I do not recommend going for example on January 1 (especially in a pandemic) long lines to deliver, to pay and many products although they have them on display there are no In the warehouse, therefore, you walked the entire store to find at the end that what you wanted there is not at the moment.

(Original)
Es un buen lugar para ver cosas para el hogar, los precios no son altos, pero no recomiendo ir por ejemplo  un 1 de enero (sobre todo en pandemia) largas filas para entregar, para pagar y muchos productos aunque los tienen en exhibición no hay en bodega por lo tanto caminaste toda la tienda para encontrarte al final que lo que querías no hay por el momento.</text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>(Translated by Google) What's not written about IKEA already? Millions of people around the world buy there, so of course it's always fun to go to IKEA and make a round to see ideas and designs, find some perfect item to fit any corner of your home, or alternatively buy all the home's furniture in one go without having to walk around in full,
The only downside is that the quality is not in the sky, but on the other hand the price is not very high and with global success you can not argue.

מה לא נכתב על איקאה כבר? מיליוני אנשים מכל העולם קונים שם, אז כמובן תמיד כיף להגיע לאיקאה ולעשות סיבוב לראות רעיונות ועיצובים, למצוא איזה פריט מושלם שיתאים בול לאיזה פינה בבית, או לחילופין לקנות את כל הריהוט של הבית במכה אחת מבלי להסתובב במלא מקומות,
החיסרון היחיד הוא שהאיכות לא בשמים, אבל מצד שני המחיר הוא לא גבוה במיוחד ועם הצלחה עולמית אי אפשר להתווכח.

<Text>(Translated by Google) I love that store !! Only that I always lose myself inside her and sometimes I realize that I only walk in a circle and I can't get out without getting lost.

(Translated by Google) Huge store with household goods and furniture. Great parking! It is convenient to choose furniture in the showroom and then pick it up yourself or order delivery. We found everything we needed there! A lot of different good dishes and household utensils. Great prices, there are very cheap things of good quality. Great staff. Delivery is not expensive. Everything was brought to us quickly, on the same day in a few hours. And also very tasty food in the cafe! And cheap! Now I love IKEA!

Огромный магазин с товарами для дома и мебелью. Большая парковка! Удобно выбрать мебель в шоуруме и потом забрать ее самому или заказать доставку. Мы нашли там все, что нам было нужно! Много разной хорошей посуды и домашней утвари. Отличные цены, есть очень дешевые вещи хорошего качества. Классный персонал. Доставка не дорогая. Нам привезли все быстро, в тот же день уже через несколько часов. А еще очень вкусная еда в кафе! И дешево! Теперь я люблю IKEA !</Text>

(Translated by Google) The first boxes are to pay 5 products or less. They should place an advertisement for those boxes, as many customers are formed in normal boxes. I recommend you go during the week in the morning because there are fewer people and enjoy more shopping. 😁

Las primeras cajas son para pagar 5 productos o menos. Deberían de poner un anuncio de esas cajas, pues muchos clientes se forman en las cajas normales. Les recomiendo ir entre semana por las mañanas pues hay menos gente y se disfrutan Más las compras. 😁<//review>

(Translated by Google) I went to IKEA to buy a T-shirt. They said, "We don't have a T-shirt." I think they are sold out. I said, "Give me pants." They said, "We don't have pants." What? I think people like their clothes. Although they don't have pants, they said, "Look at AMAZON." But I can't find the store.

(Original)
我去宜家买T恤。他们说,“我们没有T恤。” 我觉得他们卖完了。我说，“给我裤子。” 他们说，“我们没有裤子。” 什么？我觉得人喜欢他们衣服。虽然他们没有裤子，可是他们说，“你看AMAZON。” 可是我找不到商店。< /Text>

<rate>4<//rate><text>(Translated by Google) In general, the store is good, a lot of interesting things. There is a pritenziya to a fast food cafe that sells pizza. The son loves pizza very much with them, but lately the service leaves much to be desired. The tables are dirty. Previously, if you have a store card, then the coffee was free, but now they take money for it, but this is normal. Another question is what it is now, but no, tasteless. In general, they grieved us.

(Original)
В целом магазин хороший, много всего интересного. Есть притензия к кафе быстрого питания, которое продает пиццу. Сын очень любит пиццу именно у них, но в последнее время обслуживание оставляет желать лучшего. Столы грязные. Раньше, если имеешь карту магазина, то кофе было безплатное, а сейчас они берут деньги за него, но и это нормально. Другой вопрос какое оно теперь, а никакое, невкусное. В общем огорчили они нас.</text>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) At 3 points only because of the delicious coffee in the restaurant. The rest - the service has become worse, the prices of goods are too high, the assortment in Ikea restaurant has decreased.

(Translated by Google) I do not know why they give it 3 little stars ... It will be that as a good mexa 3rd world world I drool with this store with super good prices (with the dollar still at 18) and useful furniture with a quality superior to many "good" furniture stores in Mexico . It has always seemed the height to me that in CDMX, or you have to buy furniture in Casa Palacio brand Shalalá or if it does not reach you then the option is the CREA furniture. And for a change, where are all of us in the middle?
Yes, yes ... there are several affordable furniture stores, but they are the fewest and they are not sufficient, either with taste or with demand. Well, here at Ikea you don't take anything else to think about the transfer on the plane (I already did it once and it's like a reality show).
For the new ones: Come up, take your blue bag, your pencil, your list and your meter. Walk observing the different "habitats" and write down - and measure - what you like. Go downstairs go to the hall, letter and number and take what you liked. Sure, before you get to the box, something else is glued to them. You cannot leave without trying their famous Swedish meatballs or their famous jocho - all with an unpronounceable name. They also boast of their coffee always for a dollar. Move your car closer to get things up in the unloading area. (There are no chicharitos here, you come-come or any other urban creature).

(Original)
No se porque le dan 3 estrellitas nomas... Será que yo como buen mexa 3er mundista babeo con esta tienda de precios super buenos (con el dólar aun a 18) y muebles útiles con una calidad superior a muchas mueblerías "buenas" de México. Siempre me ha parecido el colmo que en CDMX, o tienes para comprar muebles en Casa Palacio marca Shalalá o si no te alcanza entonces la opción son los muebles del CREA. Y para variar, dónde quedamos todos los de en medio?
Si si... hay varias mueblerías de precio accesible, pero son las menos y no se dan abasto o con el gusto o con la demanda. Bueno, acá en Ikea uno no se lleva más nada más de pensar en el traslado en el avión (ya una vez lo hice y es como de reality show).
Para los nuevos: Suban, tomen su bolsita azul, tu lapicito, su lista y su metro. Caminen observando los diferentes "habitats" y apunten -y midan- lo que les guste. Al bajar vayan al pasillo, letra y número y tomen lo que les gustó. Seguro antes de llegar a la caja se les pega alguna cosa pequeña más. No se pueden ir sin probar sus famosas albóndigas suecas o su famosísimo jocho -todo con nombre impronunciable-. Presumen también de su café siempre a dólar. Acerca tu coche para subir las cosas en el área de carga descarga. (Aquí no hay chicharitos, viene-vienes o cualquier otra criatura urbana).< /text>

(Translated by Google) I like the store is very big the only thing that an office chair made me in bad taste the price was separately. The top for sitting is worth $ 29.99 and the base with wheels $ 22.99 maybe what is worth at $$ is not bad but it is ridiculous !! So how am I going to put the top part? IKEA was surprised with that idea because neither Office Depot has had it

(Original)
Me gusta la tienda esta muy grande lo único que se me hiso de mal gusto una silla para oficina el precio era por separado. La parte de arriba para sentarse valia $29.99 y la base con las ruedas $22.99 talvez lo que vale en $$ no este mal pero es ridiculo!! Entonces como voy a poner la parte de arriba.Me sorprendio IKEA con esa idea porque ni Office Depot la ha tenido</review>
