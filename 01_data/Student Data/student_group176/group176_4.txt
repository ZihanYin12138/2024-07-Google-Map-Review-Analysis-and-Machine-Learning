That place is a real dump! Sorry had to. So palmdale residents get two free dumps a year. You have to time it right if you dont want to wait in a huge line. I usually go at about 8:30. They accept the standard trash (I did a demo on a popup camper and was able to dump the whole thing.) There is also a place there to get rid of old electronics. There is a specific day for paints, oils, and the like.< /Text>

The first time here I was unsure of where to go, but following the signs is a good idea. The staff was very helpful in directing me and was simple to dump my trash. Excellent experience here.</Text>

The staff is always super kind and professional.  It was perfectly structured as far as getting us in, weighed and into our specific landfill area. The direction and signage is easy to follow. We arrived at 1:26 pm (in a Monday) and had a line of 5 cars ahead of us. It went pretty quickly.  As we left the line was now about 11 cars, so time was on our side!<//Text>

I have a company and have several jobs out in the Antelope Valley. Today we had Bad service my employee was turned away with a full load of trash because he was using a company credit card and he was told the owner of the company needed to be there. Which my employee then had to drive back to Riverside County to dump at Waste Management where he had no problem using the same card.</text>

They fail to pick up garbage regularly. Very rude and unhelpful. No ethics, no customer service, and lazy in the extreme. Management is lowest quality in the business. They have a monopoly and din't even come to pick up the garbage every three or four weeks. Don't return phone calls.<//review>

Wow this company has the lowest customer reviews of any I have seen. I am not surprised at all as all my interactions with Waste Management have been not been great. This company needs an internal review to be done about their business practices. I run a business in the Littlerock, CA area and ever since Waste Management took over for Benz, there has been nothing but problems. We have called more times than I can count to pay for 2nd trash pickups and never once did they come. We've paid for each request and they have never once showed up. This has happened a half dozen times. Their regular trash pickups are always late, and super messy - leaving trash all over the streets. Like another customer review said this last Thanksgiving week they never showed up at all. They were suppose to be here on the Friday after Thanksgiving and didn't pick up because there was a tiny bit of snow fall on the ground (but not on the roads by then). They should have showed up and got our trash on Saturday instead and every single person in my entire neighborhood had their cans out all weekend through that Monday. On Monday my assistant called the office and they said they wouldn't be out until our regular pickup day which is Thursday. And no they didn't offer a refund for the service we didn't get, we demanded one and got a mere $11.00 credit. My assistant spoke with Asia, she said to leave out 6 additional bags out and they would be picked up in addition to our three bins. Not surprisingly, the 6 additional bags were left by then bins and never touched. So Asia scheduled a second pickup for the additional bags for the next day. No surprise, they never showed because they never do. And now that I know I am not the only one dealing with bad customer service, I am going to launch my own investigation. I plan to contact the corporate office and get to the bottom of why this service is so bad and the customer reviews are so poor.<//text>

< Review>
I am shocked and saddened for the people of the antelope valley. THey are forced to endure the services of this aweful company!!! They have stopped service at my elderly mothers home and refuse to start it up again. I have paid for three months in advance, they promise that the trash will be pickep. a month late and three hours on the phone trash still not collected</Review>
</record>
</dataset><record>
<text>All I have to say is , WOW!!!! Put my trash cans out front on street on the far edge of my driveway for easy access and so no one will park in front of them or on the side of them  like I always do. My cans did not get emptied today. When I called and asked why, I was told the driver said my cans were blocked. Straight out lie! There’s 3 if us home today. We have been up and inside, outside, and around our house since 7:30 am cleaning. There has been no one parked anywhere near our trash cans. For our cans to be blocked there would have had to be a vehicle parked to the left of our cans, in front of our cans(which would mean they were Double parked since our cans are in the street, and there would have to have been a car parked in front of our driveway blocking our cars in as well. When I told their customer service rep. This all he could say is, well... that’s what the driver reported. I can try and get someone out there but there are no gaurantees. Needless to say I was furious!! I paid for a service, I demand that service is fulfilled. I held up my end of the bargain, they need to hold up theirs. Ended up speaking with a supervisor and basically got the same response. I told her to call me if a pick up is not going to happen. If it doesn’t happen I will go next level. If I didn’t put my cans out in the street or I put them where they could get blocked in that would be on me, but that’s is not the case. Their driver straight out lied !!!! Probably passed our cans up in error and was too lazy to come back to them. This is totally unacceptable!!!! Time to make a trip to the next city hall council meeting if this isn’t resolved in the correct manner.<//text>< UserId.>

There is a terrible lack of communication in the the company and I would have left it at that if the man I spoke to had not lied, allow me to explain.

It started last Wednesday when someone came to remove a bin I had rented until Friday. I stopped him and he checked with dispatch to find out there were conflicting phone calls made about a pick up at my house. I had not made one call but on Thursday I did request and pay for the bin to emptied on Friday, my regular pick-up day, and left for another week. Nobody came and they close promptly at 5:00 PM so I had to wait for Monday.

I called Monday and was told they were sorry and the pickup would be made Tuesday. It was and I thought everything was going to be fine. No such luck. Another truck came by and picked up my virtually empty bin and replaced it with another empty bin except they left it in the street. They know full well you can't leave a bin in the street without a permit and I left my driveway clear so it could be put back where it was. I immediately called them and spoke with a man and told him I had had two heart attacks in May. He was going to say anything to placate me and so he said he would take care of it himself.I guess he thought I was joking since nobody showed up.

Not wishing to get a fine from the city I had push it up the driveway myself resulting in my having to take extra medication. They have a monopoly but I wish Lancaster was big enough to have its own service.</text>

<Text>Horrible company, nothing but lies and additional charges, then they don't even pick up your trash. How can it be that this is the only option we have for this whole area?
I agree with a couple of the other reviewers that the drivers are really great, nice people, but the "customer service" and the company as a whole are really bad. I wish I could leave less than one star, they don't deserve even that.< /Text><Rate>1< /Rate>< user>

I have been with this service since 1990 and have never had a problem until this year.
We had one blue can for waste and one green can for yard clean up recycling stuff.
So in july the trash guy  picked up the green can and. Took it away? I called the next day they told me that my area no longer has recycling service ? So i asked if i can put out one of my personal cans if i have extra waste and was told no not any longer because of my area? So i asked to have another blue can be delivered and that way i could put trash and yard waste in it.
So my bill use to be about $38 a month .
First month with new blue can was $58 the next bill went to $103.45 so i called to find out why and was told i was being charged $32.00 for a delivery charge ?
My original blue can is $14.90 a month and the new blue can is $27.84 a month? I asked why? I was told thats just the way it is .
And if i did not like it they will pick up my cans and i will have no trash service? I asked to speak to a supervisor and she said sorry but he could not talk at this time?
Horrible customer service.<//Text>

If you go past due, and then pay the bill, which is paying for Future months service, you also have to call them and say yes I paid for future service and put my trash out because I wanted the trash picked up.  They literally took money over 2 weeks ago and did not pick up the trash. They contend this information was in my welcome packet 15 years ago.</review>

Been calling about this issue for almost three weeks and have not bring me the a new trash can they promised. All they say is they might be short and that they will swnd me one by a certain day but nothing!</review>

Absolutely the worst service available. I promise you will regret it. 100% incompetent. One hand NEVER knows what the other hand is doing. You speak to 10 people and get 10 different answers. No one will go the extra step to help you...lazy and incapable of any compassion. You can never speak to anyone in charge for in depth answers. Pass the buck to the next employee. Pathetic. We had them come out to pick up our 5 monthly bulky items. They told us to take the largest item and break it down for easier pickup. I broke it into 5 pieces..they counted each broken piece as an item. "There's your 5 items sir.." Lazy employees. Dont waste your time.< /Review>

<Review>Horrible! Customer Service Reps are defensive and lack professionalism.  I scheduled a dumpster rental a week in advance for a home remodel project.  The dumpster never arrived as scheduled.  When I called to get a status update they said there had been a change and it would arrive by 9am the next day. .  The next day AGAIN! no dumpster, Following day scheduled to arrive sometime between 9-4pm.  When I called CS they were rude very defensive that I was inquiring about the service. They said it would arrive when there was availability.  The contractor postponed until the dumpster arrived.  Absolute Nightmare.<//Review><userid>101187365884348388892</userid><rate>1< /rate>< date>

I️ have never had to jump through so many hoops for a “service” to not provide service. Bulk item scheduling is hit-or-miss. They make up rules on what they will accept and how they will accept recyclables and compostable waste, even though they make money on it. They suck.< /Review>

<review>My recycle bin was missing one day after all the trash had been picked up.  I requested a a replacement recycle bin.  I have called back every week for 6 weeks.  They tell me every week that I will get it the next service day.  I still haven't seen it.  6 Weeks!!!  Absolutely unacceptable.  Such poor customer service.  If there was any other option for waste management I would switch.</review>< pics>

This place is a circus.  We moved to the area back in November of last year and was told when we purchased service that our account qualified for two (2) "free" trips to the local dump.  The instructions were you only need to show your photo ID (license) to the operator and they will provide you one (1) free ton.  We loaded up and headed over only to find we couldn't get in (unless we paid).  We called Waste Management and they stated that our account qualifies and they weren't sure why we were denied.  We loaded up our second "free trip" last week and again drove over to be denied.  I called Waste Management and asked to speak with a Supervisor and was told they were all busy and someone would call me back - what a joke, that never happened either.  If they were only as quick to resolve issues or deal with bad information as they were to collect their payment via a "auto draft".  I wish we had options, I would drop this place in a heartbeat!</Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Unfortunately, it is the only company that collects the garbage in this place, the service is terrible, I have already reported several times to the offices that the driver who collects the garbage from the (llarda or the garden) always forgets we pass 8 days with the containers outside waiting for them to collect it, bone in 2 weeks it only happens once for me it is a robbery this happens in Gernet Ln and 26st

(Original)
Lastimosamente es la unica compania que recoge la basura en este lugar el servicio es pesimo ya he reportado en varias ocaciones a las oficinas que sienpre el chofer que hace la recoleccion de la basura de la( llarda o el jardin ) siempre se le olvida pasamos 8 dias con los contenedores afuera esperando que lo recolecten osea en 2 semanas solo pasa una ves para mi es un robo esto sucede en la Gernet Ln y 26st</Review>

I had a issue applying a coupon online. Called the store and spoke to Clair and then Jessie, both helped me out and they did a great job. I love this place and the quality is always outstanding. Thanks for always providing good service.</Text>

Called twice and they blame their franchise, not the one who owns that location! Worst service ever!! Don't pay in cash, credit card you'd get your money back. Call a real pizza company!! Got pictures of this frozen pizza, green pasta, not what we ordered, and management says call corporate!

This Pizza Guys location is my absolute favorite out of all the other locations in the surrounding area. The pizza is always ready super fast and is piping hot. There are always tons of coupons and they have free ice cream if you check in on yelp! Always order my pizza here, never had it delivered though. The shop is always very clean and the soda machines are always fully stocked. Would definitely recommend this specific spot to anyone looking for a good deal and good pizza! Will be back for sure.<//text>

This was My first time to Pizza Giys. The staff greeted me as I approached the counter.  The Young lady behind tbe counter was extremely nice and helpful with the menu and made a few suggestions, which I really appreciated.  The service was fast as it is only a takeout and delivery location. I brought my Pizza home and was very pleased with the quality.  I will Definitely be back and will gladly recommend Pizza Guys #108 to friends.< /review>

Tried pizza guys and food was amazing. We had the thin crust and mango habanero wings. Delicious. Staff was polite and my food was hot and ready when I arrived . I also dropped  my wallet which they found and called me immediately to return it. Thanks Pizza Guys!<//review>

Ordered pizza on Tuesday which is bogo day. Didn’t realize you had to order it online to get the deal. Worker said I couldn’t get the deal since I called it in. I had a coupon from the entertainment book for a buy one get one and he said I couldn’t use that either. Wouldn’t explain why. I tried to get and answer from him but he wouldn’t give me one. Told me to get out if store. Very unprofessional. Won’t be going there again and will tell my friends about the poor treatment. Used to go there all the time but no more. You need to train your employees how to treat the customer because without them you wouldn’t have a business.<//review>

I am really sorry about the experience I had with an angry person. The staff and management were very nice. I have worked in restaurants my whole life. If my friend would have acted that way in my place I would have called the police. I would like to thank you for your professionalism and promise you we will order delivery for now on😎< /review>

<Review>Its just ok pizza. Its nothing great and its expensive for the quality. Its nothing that is going to blow your mind and I would suggest getting something on a special deal or else it will be a big bill. I would suggest going elsewhere for what is considered "football" pizza.< /Review><Time>1573228168309<//Time><userid>107816398906706807579<//userid><Rate>2</Rate><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>My husband and I love Pizza Guys. We usually order from the Elk Grove Florin location, and they always do a great job. This Pizza Guys was horrible. They took over an hour and a half to get to our house. I ordered buffalo wings and they forgot to put the sauce on. The pizza looked really messy and didn't taste good. I will not be ordering from this location again.< /text></record></dataset><record>

When you're hungry but too lazy to cook or don't want to go anywhere. Always get my pizza in a 30 - 45 minute window.<//text>

As I traveled in Mandarin speaking locations in Asia, Taiwan, Shanghai for business purposes, I decided to learn the language. I have been attending Mandarin classes mainly in Winter for about 5 years. First to learn, then to  keep what I learned current when not traveling.
I have found the teachers and staff very accommodating and flexible. I can email them with questions anytime and get an answer in a day, if not immediately.
One advantage of on-line classes is you have access to a recording of the class content, so can revisit the material again if needed.
As there are many classes, I can always find one that fits my schedule.
Overall, I'm very happy with the instructors, material and method employed.

<text>I've been taking Mandarin classes here for close to 2 years now with Larry. It's consistently been a well directed class and Larry is always available to answer questions about the language. They do standard lessons, speaking courses and several for-fun free language events. I'd highly recommend them.</text>< time>

I’ve been taking Mandarin classes taught by Larry for about 2 years now and it’s been a great learning experience. The class levels are well designed with increasing complexity. The lessons are relevant to real life scenarios (for example: how to order food ask for directions, etc) which really helps retain what is being taught.</text>

<text>I love the San Jose Learning Center. I took an introductory Vietnamese language class offered by them in the fall of 2020. Seriously, everything about the class was fantastic: the instructor, the class content, the delivery style, the students, the timing of the class, their professionalism  etc. It seems like they have a real passion for language instruction and it shows in the high quality of everything that they do. Excellent value for money too.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I've been taking Mandarin lessons for the past year from Larry at San Jose Learning Center and the classes have been excellent. Larry is great at cutting through the fluff and teaching what will be practical, as opposed to the very academic ways I've been taught languages before. I set up a corporate class through my work place - classes are easy to set up and they are flexible with the arragement.<//review>

<Text>Larry has been teaching me Mandarin for the past year. A fun class and he attends to the tiniest details that make sure you learn the language so that you can actually use it. 多谢你的中文的课！< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808fcca8ed1ca7cd:0xe364ad1f2a401e13</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<resp>None</resp><Review>As an ABC, my attempts to learn Chinese over the course of my life has been riddled with unsuccessful attempts to learn Chinese. My parents gave up on Chinese school after my incessant complaining, and a couple of classes in college that didn't take.

It wasn't until taking Mandarin classes with Larry that I've found a way to learn and stick with it. Larry's approach is clear, engaging, and funny in a way that has me looking forward to class each week. Each class is interesting, but not overwhelming, and he is very patient and attentive to the class. I've attended in-person (pre-COVID) and virtual, and the transition has been smooth. If you're looking for a way to learn Mandarin, I highly recommend classes with Larry!</Review>< username>

I have been studying Mandarin at SJLC since 2019 as,  prior to the pandemic, I frequently found myself in China in my professional life.  Larry has been a phenomenal instructor in all respects, and has consistently provided an engaging and entertaining environment in which to learn.  From only knowing the most basic of phrases from my travels abroad, Larry's instruction has enabled me to communicate more effectively with my overseas colleagues.  Having attended both in-person and online courses, I cannot recommend SJLC enough for those wishing to expand their linguistic horizons.< /review>

I’ve been taking Mandarin classes here for 6 months now. Great school, fun teacher. With the shelter-in-place, classes are given online now with the same quality of education as before. Highly recommend this school, also if you’re looking to learn something new during the shelter-in-place!! They offer a wide variety of language courses, not just Mandarin.< /Review>

I've been taking Mandarin classes here for the past year (starting at level 2 ~ currently at level 5), and I have been able to learn so much! I had broken Chinese to start with, and was much better at reading and listening than speaking, and these classes have made me be a better speaker as well as learn about grammar structure. I def. recommend enrolling in a class at SJLC!<//Review>

I’ve been taking Mandarin classes from level 1-3 for the past 6 months and I’m so surprised at how much I’ve improved! I’ve gone from not understanding anything to being to listen and breaking down conversations my colleagues have.
The group classes with Larry are so much fun and he’s able to teach at a speed where you can learn if you’re an absolute beginner or if you have some basic understanding already. The class setting is small enough that you start to build a bond with everyone as you move through the levels together. Hands down the best part of my week and a good way to decompress after a long work day.</text>

<Text>I highly recommend the language program at the San Jose Learning Center. Classes are offered every 7 weeks with multiple time slots to choose from – making it easy for any working professional to incorporate this into their busy schedules. The Mandarin program is well structured and organized. The instructors, specifically Larry, creates an engaging and fun environment. Both my listening and speaking skills have improved dramatically and I look forward to class each week.< /Text>< username>

Since 2016 I have been trying to learn Mandarin. I started with Duolingo, and while the app isn't terrible, it was no way for me to learn Mandarin successfully. By the time I had gotten to the end of 2018 all I knew how to say was "hello" and "thank you".

On a whim I decided to look for language classes in the Bay Area and I signed up for the San Jose Learning Center. It was an amazing decision! The classes are very clearly well thought out. They are curated with extra practice, and emphasize learning the material as a whole rather than memorizing words.

Over the last eight months I have by far expanded my Mandarin vocabulary. I have a fantastic instructor - Larry. You can tell he really cares for his students and their success in learning Mandarin. If you are considering learning a new language, I would highly recommend signing up for the San Jose Learning Center. It is definitely worth the time and money!!<//text>

<review>Two years ago I decided to learn Mandarin and I had the fortune of discovering the San Jose Learning Center. The school is amazing, and the staff is efficient, effective and friendly. You can see that Alicia has put a lot of love into this school.

Nevertheless I won't be able to last this long in this journey without my teacher Larry. He is one of the most dedicated and passionate teachers I have ever met. He has made the difference for me and my wife on our journey of learning Mandarin and discover more of the amazing Chinese culture.

Thanks Alicia and Larry for making this possible.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fcca8ed1ca7cd:0xe364ad1f2a401e13< /gmap_id></record>

<text>I highly recommend Larry Xue for Mandarin lessons!  I have been taking classes with Larry for about 7 months and they have really paid off. I spoke no Mandarin before meeting with Larry. Now I can converse on a basic level when traveling in Taiwan and China and I am continuing to improve every week. I will definitely keep working with Larry and he receives my highest recommendation.< /text>< Pictures>

I've taken Mandarin 1-4 and just signed up for Mandarin 5. The instructors as SJLC are fabulous. I've taken classes with Natalie and Celia and both are great teachers, patient and incredibly helpful. SJLC also adapted very quickly to the shelter in place orders for COVID and continue to provide high quality instruction over Zoom. Thank you to my amazing instructors and everyone at SJLC for providing a great space to develop new language skills.< /text>

I decided to take French lessons to "polish" my self-guided audio course. The class is small, altered to the students' needs. The teacher provides necessary instructions and skillfully navigates the students to utilize the skills they already have and to explore the new vocabulary or grammar. The teacher includes history/cultural aspects in the process. I like that the teacher gives lots of opportunity for conversation during the class and also assigns homework that requires creativity and revision of material. Simply put, it is helpful and fun! Also, the staff at School is very friendly and accommodating. Definitely I have very great experience! Recommend at least to try.< /review>

<Review>San Jose Learning Center has a large variety of group classes as well as private lessons to choose from. I haven't seen so much variety for language classes in the Bay Area anywhere else. The classes are very easy to follow and the work is not a burden on busy working professionals. Hope to come back to take more classes soon!<//Review>< rate>

<time>1554415220579<//time><text>I have been learning Mandarin from Larry from level 2 to level 6 through classes offered at work. When I switched jobs a year ago, I found out that Larry is teaching the same level Mandarin class at my new workplace, so I was able to continue, and I'm glad I have stuck with it. He is without question the best language teacher I've ever had, for any language.

I have previously taken Mandarin classes at UCSD, and those classes used an older text and emphasized perfect tone pronunciation from the beginning, and it made things very difficult. In contrast, Larry creates his own up-to-date learning material and he does not stress perfect pronunciation at the early levels. This has made it much easier for me to learn new material, and my tone pronunciation is gradually improving with practice. I also appreciate his sense of humor and his willingness to answer any of our questions on the spot.

Mandarin is a very useful language for me, both at home and on business trips. It has been a great experience to understand more and more of what people are saying, and also to bond with other students/coworkers in the class.< /text>< user_id>

The Center offers a lot of classes, but there are also chances to socialize with the other students. For example, I've taken several sessions of German classes, and there are monthly Stammtisch (social gatherings) open to all. Even better, the school regularly schedules foreign trips, so you have the opportunity to tour with others from the school on adventures around the world.< /Text>< Pics>

As with any learning experience, the student AND the teacher must be motivated and Larry is definitely motivated to teach you Mandarin.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I have taken Arabic 1 at this location and it has been a great experience. The site has free Wifi, snacks, coffee and tea so if you want to review prior to your session you can sit in the lounge/kitchen area. The class size is small, which is my ideal learning scenario.

Regarding Arabic, the focus in learning is extremely basic (which is much appreciated for a complete beginner). In Arabic 1, you'll learn the Arabic alphabet along with pronunciations, simple word construction, cultural topics and basic vocabulary and greetings.

If you do take a course at this center, discuss the reason why you are learning the language with your instructor and which specific region interests you. This is important since in some languages, there is a pronunciation difference based on region.

My only issue about this location is that the parking lot exit is very low so you need to exit very slowly or else your car's "undercarriage"(?) will scrape the street. Other than this minor issue, I've had a great time learning at this center! shukraan! :)<//text><resp>None<//resp>< Date>

If you are looking to learn a new language I highly encourage you to check out SJLC!! I have been taking Mandarin classes here in preparation for a work assignment abroad and I am really impressed with how much we've managed to cover in a 7 week course. The instructor is very experienced and does a great job with structuring the lesson in a way that makes sense as well as giving us time to practice. I know that learning a language can be daunting but the classroom environment is very welcoming and at least in my class, the other students have all been encouraging as well.

I haven't attended any yet but I know that in addition to classes they also offer events and workshops, as well as group trips that you can join! It seems like SJLC wants to bring together a community of language learners and culturally curious people and I think it does just that.< /text>

Fantastic Mandarin curriculum by Larry. If you're afraid of Chinese because it seems hard, Larry can get you through it. He doesn't make it easy, but he does make it straightforward, memorable, and fun.  Online resources, games, physical books, top-notch audio, and challenging homework make the class worth the effort. Also, there's a ton of levels, including ones focussed on conversation, if that's your aim.</Review>

Celia have been giving private Mandarin lessons for over a year. She always prepares my lesson materials and send follow up lesson note after lessons. She is great teacher with providing very thoughtful and customized guidance. In addition, I need to change class schedule due to my business trip. She is very flexible to arrange lessons.

Recently I passed HSK3 exam! because of Celia's teaching. My weakness was listening skill, I am amazed how I could improve my listening skill quickly with her teaching.

I highly recommend Celia's class and I am looking forward to continue taking her class and pass next HSK level!</Text>

The Mandarin class at SJLC taught by Larry is top notch. My Mandarin is improving very fast and I can now have small conversations with native Chinese speakers when business traveling to China. At the time I write this review, I have taken four complete sessions and I’m now on the fifth session. Larry teaches the class in a pace that pushes you just enough to get you motivated and really work on the material. What is best about Larry is that he is a trained and experienced language teacher who really understands the Mandarin Grammar and its hurdles for non-native Chinese speakers. I’m really happy with my progress and I’m having fun learning. By the way, Mandarin is my fifth foreign language. I’ve seen a variety of foreign language methods and teachers. This class is the best I’ve seen in all my foreign language learning experiences. I highly recommend SJLC Mandarin class taught by Larry.<//review>

<Text>A great language school especially if you take classes while working full time! I've been at SJLC for a little over a year now taking Japanese classes, and I love it. Having a place to practice speaking in a foreign language is invaluable, and having a great instructor can make a world of difference. SJLC definitely cultivates great teachers and is very responsive to feedback. I highly recommend Kiyono-sensei for any of your Japanese classes! I hope to continue these classes for as long as possible.</Text><time>1550728567213< /time>< user_id>

<username>Aswini Vijayaraghavan</username><Time>1554317145463</Time><rate>5< /rate><review>I am a student of Mandarin level 2 (Teacher: Larry Xue). SJLC has been great to work with to arrange languages classes at work. My colleagues and I enjoy our Mandarin lessons every week. I personally look forward to Fridays, just because of Mandarin class.

Larry is a great teacher, he provides clear and retainable examples and that helps me learn better. I like the homework activity that makes us interview native Mandarin speakers, this encourages us to speak and improve our pronunciation. I also find the structure of the course and content (for eg: color coding of verbs vs nouns etc.) to be very helpful.

I have learnt other languages from different languages schools in various places and I can say that the Mandarin course at SJLC taught by Larry is in par with the best language schools. 我喜欢SJLC.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>I really enjoy studying at SJLC for more than 2 years. I used to go to another language school for studying German but I finally found my tribe here. The best thing about this language school is the atmosphere or culture that the Christina (German teacher), students and Alicia create.  Let's be honest, studying a new language is not easy, you not only need a good teacher but also a good vibe that you can motivate each other and sometimes hang out outside of the language school to enjoy :) SJLC encourage students to create a community for learning a new language. If you want to learn a new language and want to find your awesome tribe, check out SJLC.</Text>< name>

The San Jose Learning Center is a great place to take language classes. I've taken Italian 2 and 3 with Sara Galli, and the classes were great. It was a small group so we each had a lot of time to talk and practice. Sara is a wonderful instructor and her lessons were organized, informative and she also told us about the culture and history of Italy. She also made herself available by email or text between classes if we had any questions. In addition, I took Mandarin 1 with Liyan Luo. Mandarin is difficult, but she explained things well and helped us a lot with our pronunciation. Lyn's teaching materials were great too. She provided color PowerPoint slides with pictures which was great for understanding the material. The office staff are also wonderful, pleasant and always available to help by phone or in person. I highly recommend the San Jose Learning Center!<//Review>

I recently completed Korean Level I and Level II classes at San Jose Learning Center. I was interested in learning Korean so that I could better communicate with my Korean in-laws. I was initially really nervous and intimidated to learn a new language, but my Korean instructor Nanmo has been great! She broke down the alphabet and the basic structure of the language - which definitely made it a lot less intimidating. The classes are well paced and definitely doable for someone working full time. It has been rewarding to make progress and to be able to read and write basic Korean. The class sizes at SJLC are generally small and everyone gets sufficient individual attention. Both my classes had ~ 5 students. If you have to miss a class then you can do a brief make-up section for a discounted rate (super good deal!).

The other thing I love about SJLC is the welcoming environment. All the instructors and staff are very friendly. They have water, coffee (definitely necessary after a long work day), and snacks for all the students. They even plan group meet-ups and trips all over the world! It's been a pleasure to get know my classmate as well - we are able to encourage each other along the way and hold each other accountable for making it to class. Many of us will be moving on to Korean 3 and planning some future Korean events as a class.

SJLC also has coupons for returning students and if you make referrals. Overall, these small group classes are a great deal for the price and I would highly recommend for anyone trying to learn a new language!

감사합니다 (Thank you) SJLC!<//Text>

<userid>117255418283236636152</userid><Text>I have been taking Mandarin classes at San Jose Learning Center for over two years. I started off in level 1, and have taken all levels up to level 11. I am currently enrolled in Mandarin Intermediate. I'm amazed at how much I have learned over the past 2 years. I can confidently speak with native Mandarin speakers, whether they are my coworkers or when I travel to China for business trips, which is really exciting.

I have taken all my classes with Larry Xue who has been a fantastic teacher. Larry does an excellent job of structuring the classes and covering a digestible amount of material in each class. We practice speaking, listening, and reading through a variety of exercises in every class. We learn new vocabulary and grammar in each class as well. The class sizes are small so students receive a lot of individual attention. The homework assignments are also very well designed, and help students solidify and practice the concepts. Mandarin is a very difficult language to learn, and Larry does an excellent job of making it fun and easy to learn.

I also have found that the time commitment to learning Mandarin at SJLC is very manageable, and I am able to balance the amount of time spent in class and outside of it on homework with my full time job and other commitments. The few times I have not been able to attend classes, Larry has always been flexible and provided make up lessons to cover the material I missed in class.

I can't recommend Larry and the SJLC highly enough! It's a great place for adults to learn Mandarin!</Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Resp>

Our instructor for the last 2 years, 김혜진 (Haejin Kim), is the real deal. A native of Seoul, she worked there (and is still certified) as a teacher, and brings this real-world, bona fide experience and expertise to the classroom.

The class curricula are flexible, tailored to fit individual student interests. Whether you're preparing for the TOPIK exam, seeking insight into your favorite Kpop/Kdrama (BTS or Red Velvet, anyone?), or looking for a deep dive into the language and culture, professor Kim provides just the right level of instruction.

Free cookies, coffee, and tea are provided for all SJLC students. Classes can be attended live or streaming, and makeup classes, if needed, can easily be scheduled.

Give SJLC a try. Once you do, you'll be back for more.

Active Networks runs the school, or at least provides the infrastructure and logistics for the school, including accepting and processing payment for classes.

In their waiver, you have to sign away your right to sue them IF, for example, your personal or financial information gets compromised or stolen.  They EXPLICITLY state that they make NO GUARANTEE that their website(s) are "error free" or "secure" (which is a very odd thing to not guarantee, I thought).  This means that if your data gets stolen, guess what, you're out of luck.  You agreed not to hold them responsible.  It also says more than once to sign up "at your own risk."

I didn't sign up simply because I don't like not being able to sue them in the event my data gets stolen or compromised.  Read, read, read.

For the record, I am not saying I think they're corrupt or scammers.  I don't know.  But they clearly have no interest in ever getting sued for ANY REASON.  This degree of paranoia from a business is a red flag to me.  Just thought I'd share.<//review>< pictures>

Finding a vet you can trust  with a caring staff is unfortunately very hard to find. I've never been to a vet were I can genuinely feel like my pets are being taken care of until I found Habra Linda Vet. I've brought two of  my kittens here for vaccinations and neutering/spaying. I was a mess when I had to drop off my kitten to get spayed but I had full confidence in the doctor and staff.
Laurie is a gem. She took such good care of my baby and she even gave me updates. I'm so grateful to have found a good vet for my kittens. I've never felt like they were just trying to make money off me.< /text>

Good: Quick & inexpensive; very close to where I live (a few blocks away).

Not so good: Recommended unnecessary treatment*; emails go unanswered/ignored; won't pursue Fi Nano microchip I want to pay them to put in my dog, which they will receive for free. I had to go to a different Vet in Yorba Linda to get it implanted.

Annoying: Insufficient parking.

*Specifically, the Vet recommended a mosquito borne illness vaccination for our puppy. I pushed back as it seemed unnecessary to me. The doctor later agreed that is effectively irrelevant here in SoCal and then basically complimented me for thinking logically about it and causing him to question his own presumptions.< /Review>

This office has cared for my family's pets for over 20 years. They go above and beyond to provide quality care. I always leave with a clear understanding of why this treatment plan was selected. A big shout out goes to Dr. Garcia for just calling (not scheduled) to see how my cat was doing. I love this staff so much!<//text>

I took my dogs in for a thorough health check. The doctors were very kind and knowledgeable. I got some good advice to treat the one dog that needed a little extra care. The Financial rates are reasonable. all of the staff we're kind and very caring with the animals. I would highly recommend this Animal Hospital to anyone who wants to get good care for their pets! I will definitely be going back !!!< /text>

Very impressed with the care we received from Brian for our three sheltie. He had us bring all of them in for their flea infestation as we needed a prescription for Nexgard. He had alot to do with other patients but was very thorough and caring with "our boys".</review>

<Text>I adopted my kitten from the high school I work at.  He would be wondering around every morning when I would open up the school.  We caught him in a trap cage and it was love at first sight so I took him home.  I have to say he was a feral cat but with love I'm sure hes getting domesticated.   I took him to habra linda hospital to get neutered,  and vaccinated also micro chipped.  I'm so pleased with both doctors and the staff there.  The experience for my baby was a good one.  Not only did they address his physical needs but also his emotional needs as well.  This puts habra Linda hospital a step above other pet hospitals.   I highly recommend this place for your pet needs.  Warm friendly people who love animals.< /Text>< Pics>

I have been going to this clinic for years.  Two of the doctors are wonderful.  The female vet doesnt seem to be as caring.  I had to put my cat to sleep and the doctor stayed late so I could be there.  He was very caring and sympathetic.
When we brought our dog in he is taken care and and they remember us and our needs.
Dont let the female doctor scare you away ask for someone else.  I do.</Text>

My family had taken our dog here for years and thought they were okay but never extraordinary. When it was time for our dog to be put down due to old age we chose this place as they had worked with our dog for years. My brother went in to do it because he was the only one who could handle seeing our little guy be put to sleep. When he went in they told that in order to go into the room it was going to be an extra $30 on top of the fee they were charging for the euthanasia. My mom had given him cash to pay and he didn't have extra cash so he left our dog to be put to sleep by himself. It was my brother's judgement call to do that but we think it was really ridiculous to charge to be in the room with your pet, who to many are like family, when he gets put to sleep. The thought that my family dog had to die alone in a room scared and alone will never leave me and I hate this place for putting my brother in the position where he had to make that choice without prior knowledge.< /review>

Thank you so much! I greatly love the service that I received from the staff working in this shop. He was very accommodating, nice, and helpful. Honestly, he was the one to help me find the best pet, and I loved it. Their shop was clean, comfortable, and pets were well-arranged. Eventually, I came to realize that I will come back from time to time here. Again, thank you for the service!<//text>

A week ago, I decided to buy two hamsters for my cousin. I was so glad that I found your shop with the help of my sister. As I visited your pet shop, I felt so happy when you offered those pets at a very affordable price. My cousin was so surprised by my gift to her. Thanks much, guys!< /text>

<text>I bought my puppy here for his grooming. I like how their groomer did the grooming of my puppy. She did a great job doing it. The pet shop was so cleaned and spacious as well. The staff was so friendly and accommodating as well. The owner was so courteous as well. I will bring my puppy here again.</text>< Pictures>

They were friendly to me when I was there. I like this place, however, the appearance of the store could use some work because I thought they were shutting down from the way it looked. Overall, I like it.</review>

<Review>One of the worst pet shops I have ever been to. Dozens of animals stuffed into disgustingly tiny tanks. No heaters or enrichment for any of the tropical birds. No air pumps, sumps, or any equipment for the fish tanks (which were all completely FULL of gigantic goldfish). The tanks were egredgiously overstocked and underfiltered. The reptiles had no heat source, many had no hides and were being cohabbed, which is a major NO for animals like leopard geckos, ball pythons, and others that were crammed together when I visited. There were around 10 red slider turtles left in a 3 foot long tank with less than an inch of water in it. There was only one dry area for them, all of the turtles were struggling to sit on the one dry rock under the (I'm hoping it was a heat lamp) heat lamp. No source of temperature control or filter in their tank either. The finches all had overgrown toenails and could hardly move in their cages. Around 6 rats were in each of the 3 tanks for them -these tanks couldn't have been more than 10 gallons each. ALL of the rats had scabs and bloody patches from fighting with one another. The "baby rats" cage (as it was labelled) was completely covered in newspaper, and one of the owners yelled at me when I tried to look inside.

There's signs saying "No pictures!!! No videos!!!" in every corner of the store. If the owners were really taking good care of the animals they have in stock, they wouldn't feel the need to hide what's inside their store. Not to mention, many of the animals have questionable origins. Some of the birds for sale are listed as illegal to own in the state of California, I'm doubtful as to if the owners know this. I'd say it's safe to assume so, unless they're so ashamed of their husbandry that they have to put signs up everywhere saying not to share pictures of their store.

I spent some time talking to and petting their Amazonian blue faced parrot through the cage she was in. When the lady (one of the owners) saw this, she ran over and yelled at me, claiming this bird bites. I'm not trying to call into question the treatment of these animals, but I've worked with very agressive birds before, and this animal nuzzled his face into my hand upon meeting me for the very first time. I really don't see a bird this friendly biting anyone without provocation.

After she yelled at me to stop, the lady ran around the corner of one of the aisles in the store and said something to her husband, who then came around the corner and followed me the rest of the time I was inside. Which wasn't very long, because as soon as I started to look through the goldfish tanks, he told me that the store was closing and that I needed to leave immediately. I asked why, since it was a few hours earlier than the listed closing time on their door. He just said, "No, you need to get out now."

I went across the street (where my bus stop was) and watched as they proceeded to... Not close the store. And let other customers in. For the full 30+ minutes I waited for the bus. Funny how they were so eager to close when I was looking around, but didn't seem to be in a rush once I was gone.

Needless to say, I will not be going back to their location for business. I will do my best to document what I saw and add the photos to my review.

If you've read this far and are looking for a good place to get fish, birds, and other animals, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Age of Aquariums in Long Beach, Reptile Factory in Long Beach and Garden Grove, Hong Kong Tropical Fish in Norwalk, Atlantic Tropical Fish in Norwalk (which sells various fish, birds, and some reptiles), and ESPECIALLY Tiki's Tropical Fish in Bellflower (which sells nearly every animal and all you'd need to care for them). These shops have exemplary quality animal care and stocking, and the owners are knowledgeable when it comes to the animals they sell and how to care for them. Please consider doing a little extra driving to support one of these businesses, they really do care about their line of work. I went into the Ramirez pet shop expecting the same, and left dismayed.< /Review><Time>1527917810181</Time><pics>None<//pics><Rating>1</Rating></record>

<Resp>None</Resp><pictures>None</pictures><Text>Ever find that you're looking for a good cup of coffee- nothing special - just a good cup of coffee, full bodied and rich aroma? Cuppa Joe is THE place To GO!

Even when both lines are to the street, the friendly staff at Cuppa Joe are fast, accurate, and made me feel like there was no line behind me.

Way better customer service than the starbucks. Do everyone a favor and support this local spot. And avoid the harassment you’ll get from trying to go thru the drivethru at starsucks.<//text>

Great service! They help load your truck. Friendly staff. And they help get the best lumber in the stack. Been remodeling a house in Ukiah for 6 month. It is the only place I will go for my lumber and hardware.< /review>

Line moves quick and the limited options  are usually always available. A good amount of food for ~$12, and I can eat a lot. Thee cafateria seating area is very nice. There are some booths, but seating consists mostly of chairs. The views from the big windows aren't bad, either.<//Text>

<Review>The food here is pretty darned good for being just under $10 in downtown San Francisco. I had the mix'n match bowl which comes with your choice of rice and anywhere from 1 to 3 sides.

I picked the eggplant tofu, key lime fish, and spicy country chicken with brown rice. The dishes must've been hastily prepared b/c there was a bit too much lime in the fish and the chicken was a tad dry, but everything else was on point.

The service is very fast and this is a clean place.

If I need a quick Thai lunch, I'll be going here again.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<name>Alice Jou<//name><time>1370832863739< /time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>A cafeteria style Osha! You can mix and match whatever you want into a large bowl for a fixed price of $9.95. If you're not very hungry you can get a small box with just rice and one item for a cheaper price. They carry their popular dishes like pad thai, pumpkin curry, eggplant, etc. They also have made to order items like special noodle bowls and crepes.

Most people take their food to go, but there is some seating available. You can also order online in advance. This Osha location allows you to enjoy a variety of dishes for a great price.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I stopped getting lunch here because of Taylor's repellent customer service.  He's the only Caucasian, stationed at the register, policing orders so that no special requests are honored.  His sarcasm and baditude make me un-hungry so I walk out.  The food's good though.</Review>< Pictures>

The absolute best lunchtime place close to the FiDi. Tip: the pad see ew is way better than the pad thai, and if you want no carbs at all, ask for broccoli as your base. The lemongrass chicken and pepper beef are my fave entrees.</text>

Everything was good except one of the issues I brought my car to get fixed was never touched. So now I have to take my car back a few days later so they can fix said problem.
Update: so when I bought my volt from them they only gave me a 1 year warranty. 2 months afterwards, one of my door locks gets stuck and I have a motion sensor that's always beeping really loud saying I'm about to hit something even though there isn't anything there. They are charging me close to $1,300 just to get my car to shut up and let me unlock my door. If their products were any good they would've slapped a longer warranty on it. But they knew they were selling me a cheap product. I'm alrwady spending more on this car that I did on my old 93 eclipse.< /review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I did not have a pleasant experience with this dealership. It started off fine with my salesperson, but as soon as we began to talk about numbers, the finance people were so rude. After going back and forth reaching a deal, I still couldn't take the car home. There was a system update that the needed a GM tech for (understandable). Well it ended up taking 5 additional days. I had to call and ask for updates and threaten to cancel the transaction completely.
When I finally went to pick up the car (I scheduled a time), it wasn't washed, hadn't been gassed, plated were not on. So what should have taken 30 minutes or so ended up taking an hour and a half with 2 small kids in tow.

Even though I love my car, the service was subpar to say the least.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
Tried to rip me off in service. 800.00 for battery cables not needed. Had to take my car someplace else. Turned out to be a 200.00 crank sensor I had to pay for outta pocket that was covered under warranty. Called the reimbursement number to be told SOL.. No service, no warranty, no respect. Carl in service is a lier..<//Review>

<review>If I could give a 0 star review, I would.  The service department did not call with updates or return repeated calls regarding status of repairs.  They promised same day follow up on the inspection status of my car repair never called.  My husband had to call repeatedly for 2 days following to find out the status.  Calls were not answered or returned.  When finally getting a hold of someone on the 3rd day of trying, the service advisor, Junior (Obdulio) gave a status update on the wrong car and then called back saying he had mistaken my car for another customer's and that they had not done any inspection on my car at all.  All they needed to do was change the oil and then they could not do anything else for another 1,000 miles.  By far, the worst customer service ever.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>Quoted 2 hours for change of 2 tires...which is rediculous in itself but I understood given the early traffic of cars there. Seemed reasonable until I ultimately have ended up waiting 4 hours and counting.......for 2 tires. Absurd.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dd34f60e971a8d:0x864d9b49d26d84be< /gmap_id>< userid>

<gmapID>0x80dd34f60e971a8d:0x864d9b49d26d84be< /gmapID><review>I take my Camaro in just for a courtesy checkup to refill air in my tires, top up windshield washer fluid, and replace my wipers that I bought from their parts department but as I’m driving back home, I get a check engine light and noticeable engine loss of power.

I quickly open the hood to check all the lines and sure enough, the intake hose going to my throttle body is COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED with the hose clamp missing! Lucky for me I had another clamp laying around and I fix the issue myself but then I realized that this possibly was maliciously done due to the dirty looks I was receiving from the same tech who drove in my car and returned it to me. It could just be a coincidence but I’m pretty sure a service department doesn’t tamper with your lines for a courtesy checkup! I contact the service department to explain the situation and of course they denied responsibility.

I don’t bother taking this up any further because I fixed the issue on my own, but for someone who’s not so “mechanically inclined” just imagine the hell that could’ve brought them. For a service department to purposely want to cause harm to your car speaks volumes of the kind of people that work there. I wouldn’t return to this place if it was the last Chevy dealership on earth!<//review>< name>

Though I am a bit bummed that they took out the skate park, the new play park that they put in next to the hall is down right fantastic, I will be bringing my loving family here often. As I said before, the only flaw this place has is that it took out the skate park inplace of having a huge slab of open concrete, so for that I give only 4/5.<//Text>< pics>

Beautiful place to let the kids and dogs run. Very light traffic helps put your mind at ease. Horseshoe pit, playground that used many times in my day, a few locally owned businesses, and a library right by it. Perfect little park for a little town. Could use some sort of restroom, but thats not in the budget</Review>

Find a Museum; not big but, rich in Truth for Tuolumne City. It appears
" The Tribe" is buying the whole town. See the town museum & take a walkabout. It's beautiful here.</Review>

They have so many activities that they do here. I was here for a dog fair. It was a lot of fun. Right next door is the Veterans Memorial Hall. It is a wonderful building.</text>

Nice park, no bathrooms or water fountains, its just a plain open grassy area with some trees, benches/tables and a gazebo. Basic, but nice.<//Text>

You don’t want to go to this store.... unless you are looking for an unprofessional services at the pharmacy. Valid prescription but not allowed to deliver the drug? No, you are not willing to visit this permise.<//review>

Pharmacist was inexperienced and did not find my child’s profile and duplicated it. I was promised that it would be filled in 20 min and many hours later still not done. Delayed care not to mention wasted our time.< /Text>

Purchased 1 package exercise bands, which had already been open with damaged sleeve, and did not notice the fine print for latex content. Store manager strictly enforces Covid-19 no return policy. This CVS new policy only benefits them financially at the expense of the customers. They are profiteering from the pandemic! Go to Rite aid or Walgreen, no more CVS!< /Review>

At this difficult time, most stores are kind to help their customers. Yet, CVS not only does not try to help more, but also make all sales final and refuse for any return and even exchange! The greed is simply appalling. They should not be in the community.< /Review>

Wow. I work at a clinic and needed  to call in a new prescription for a client.  I was on hold for 20mins the 1st time. Called again and was put on hold 3x. Once I got a person I told her how unprofessional  it was to keep people on the phone  for more than 5mins. She then said the pharmacist  was busy. I understood  but was frustrated  because  I was calling on behave of my boss(Doctor) she then put me on hold again without any warning or anything. Basically  hanging up on me after I said I was calling for the doctor. I was then kept on hold for a total of 45 mins EACH time I called. Horrible  service  I will be reaching  out to Corporate  to complain< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>The pharmacists need to learn customer service. Waited on the phone on hold for 30 minutes, the pharmacist answers and says "please hold" so i do so and wait another 30 minutes. The Pharmacist hangs up soon after. I called again and this time he says please hold and hangs up again. After the second time I was mislead, I went in to speak with the Pharmacist in person. The Pharmacist brushed me off. He obviously needs some customer service training.

The only reason I go to this location is because its close by... the experience is getting worse each time. I think you should replace your Pharmacists with people who will listen to the customers and actually help your business.

For anyone reading this, I would advise you go to the Walgreens on the corner of Pico and Robertson. While its still a large pharmacy, the staff there is much more friendly and will actually address your questions rather than shove you off. If not there, there are also a bunch of smaller privately run pharmacies nearby where you can leverage GoodRx to offset the costs of your script.<//review>< pictures>

They haven't answered the phone for 52 minutes this morning. I lost my patience and hung up. Called again this afternoon, already on hold for 2 hrs and 5 minutes. As soon as I run out of my refills, I'll take my business to another pharmacy. This is not acceptable!< /text>

The worst pharmacy branch on the earth! Not in the class of Beverly Hills. I recommend to the CVS HQ to completely close this branch for the sake of their remaining credit! or if yet still want to have this worst branch, change every body at the store, from manager and supervisor to doctors and cashiers....</text>

Surprised by most of the posts.  The customer service for me was very good.  The pharmacy was able to utilize my MedImpact coverage which gave several other pharmacies problems.  Also, the use of text alerts and (at times) the CVS app for pickup makes the process much faster.  I have never dropped off a written prescription as all of mine have been e-scripted, but this is the new standard.  Unlike other places, parking is simple and easy and the store is navigable (like most CVS branches) very easily.

I would recommend this CVS to someone who wanted to have an easy pickup with an e-prescription who lives in West LA/Beverly Hills.< /review>

<text>I called to place a prescription at 7:05 pm 3/10/2020. The pharmacist was "extremely rude and unprofessional", and refused to take a prescription for a patient. I will never refer anyone to this pharmacy.  It's shameful for the pharmacy to hire such an unprofessional pharmacist.<//text>< pictures>

I have spent 20 to 30 minutes in line waiting for prescriptions that have been reported filled, only to find them not filled. Then they are promised ready in 10 minutes. As that ups my time to 40 minutes standing in CVS, I choose to come back the following day. Wait in line again for 20 minutes, and the prescription has not been filled. But can be in 10 minutes.
I suspect it is a management issue, as they are horrendously understaffed.
By far the most convenient pharmacy for me geographically, but I will never be setting foot in it again.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

A functionally retarded lemur would provide better service than these painfully incompetent individuals. There's a long line 100% of the time. There is a 100% chance your prescription will be lost or just not filled. The pharmacists are rude,  bitter, difficult and have the customer service savvy of a group of 15 year old sandwich artists who hate their jobs. I feel sorry for their loved ones for having to put up with them on holidays. The whole staff should be fired. The DMV has a much better reputation for customer service.

The rest of the store is super.</text>

When I asked a question, I overheard the person on the other line mutter "I don't have time for this". I asked when they closed today, and it wasn't for another 3 hours.

The store is disorganized and the help is lacking. The worst part about this CVS is there pharmacy. They give inaccurate information, they have issues with their inventory, they are not timely when giving medication, the really understaffed Regardless if you can go to this pharmacy expect to stay at least a half an hour.  However, the absolute worst thing they do is they always Mitt's boxes. Do not ask your doctor to fax your medication to the pharmacy.</review>

The pharmacy has me on the phone waiting 20 minutes with no answer. How irritating. They tell me, "it'll just be a few minutes." 30 minutes later and still no answer. I will be switching my prescription location because this is just unacceptable. Do not send your perscription here. They need to get their organization together because this is just awful-30 minutes just to talk to ANYONE who works there? Not. Okay.</Review>

Be sure to call them on the phone if you try to use the drive thru. Called after waiting for a few minutes to a rude response of we didn't hear it. They also refuse to check if they can get things they don't have, they just say we don't have. It's across the street from my office and I have to stop going here.< /review>

It's hard to imagine how a national chain like CVS could let one of its higher-profile locations be so poor in every respect.< /Review>

We have someone in the family who can't have salt on fries or burgers.  They were able to accommodate the no salt request for both a burger and grilled chicken burger.  Their charbroiled  burgers are great.  They have a seasonal french onion burger that I highly recommend.</text>

< Review>
Came here a few weeks ago, ordered my food, they told me they would text me when it’s ready. I went to wait in my car as per social distancing, and I sat and waited and waited and waited until eventually I just went in and checked just to find that my food had been ready all along but I never received any kind of text, when I had certainly given it. By the time I had gotten it it was not fresh and I was so tired of wasting my time I decided to leave and not come back.

Today i drove by and thought hey I’m already in the area just need something quick and convenient and my gf suggest this place and I decide to give it one more shot because I liked the garlic fries which I quickly found out they didn’t even have anymore. My gf chose to get a few things anyways because we are already there, she orders, gives them her number, same exact thing as last time where they never text her to confirm her order being ready, she expects it this time and goes in to get it, she tells him her order and he gets an attitude with her telling her she needs a number when she just ordered 5 minutes ago and it wasn’t even that busy, and they ask if she’d like any ranch but then never gave it to her.

Tired of having bad experiences here, I now see this is not one isolated incident, but a regular occurrence. So I will not be coming back ever again.<//Review>

Great place fairly busy. Just as a friendly suggestion, speak up when you order because they have plastic barriers at the register and have a hard time hearing your order accurately. My sister ended up getting a totally different order because of it and they still corrected it for free later.< /Review>

<text>Been going to the Habit for a while now. My girlfriend and I enjoy their food quality and good customer service.  Their bottomless strawberry limeade is the low key star for my returns to this place. And the promotions that come up really make this a good place to eat at and be bank for the buck.</text>< Pics>

Very good I recommend if you like mushrooms the portabello burger. It has an aioli sauce that takes the burger another level and it has cheese so for the money jts worth it over the regular char burger.<//review>

This review is more for the gentleman who took our order. Went to grab a lot of food for family, some complicated orders, and the older man (who looked like he owned or operated the place) was super nice. He was patient with our order, double checked everything to make sure we had what we needed, sorted everything in the bags neatly and explained to us what each bag had, and all around made some funny jokes. Habit food is great but this guy made the experience so much better, didn't get his name or anything but glad they have someone like that.</review>

<Review>Had a terrible experience picking up my order yesterday! Woman behind counter decided to skip over me and help 2 other customers that took a few minutes to help (one wrong order, a kid asking for condiments) and had a major attitude when I politely asked for my meal that was bagged and 100% ready to go sitting next to her. She (manager/supervisor) said "uhhh, it's going to be a few minutes" and rolled her eyes. It wasn't even that busy in the restaurant! I walked out with a melted (completely separated) chocolate malt, cold fries, and a very bad taste in my mouth.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Fries were good, and shake not bad.

The Habit has a great offering of burgers, salads, sides and even deserts. The food is always fresh, prices are great and they're consistent from one location to the next. My go to lately has been the Southwest BBQ Chicken Salad with a side of Tempura Greebeans. Can't go wrong with that. If your looking for a majorly hearty burger, gotta go for the Santa Barbara Char and add BACON!</Text>

They are very good. The debate is still up in the air about whether this place is better than In-n-out. The burgers seem fresh and everything and have good flavor to them. I usually come during lunch which is a bad idea because everyone else has the same idea. The place is new so it is clean.< /text>

This place is a great burger place. Habit Burger has a kids menu which is not overpriced and their burgers are delicious. Their fries are not overpriced either, and are very very good. There is a condiment bar with ketchup, mustard, jalapenos, and other types of peppers to add on your burger! Overall I just love this place.<//text>

<review>The service is usually good. The staff knows their product. It has not been super crazy when we visited, but the parking lot is always packed. There are three or four other restaurants nearby with quality food, and a 24 hour fitness within the same lot. Anything you order, get a side of ranch. Their ranch dressing is on point here< /review><name>E. Len Libao</name><Gmap_id>0x80dd271158d01031:0xbb6a1f47dbcedbc5< /Gmap_id></record>

Not great. One person taking orders and then bagging up other orders. Fries not under heat lamp, so they were almost cold, just not good at all. They needed someone else bagging up orders or getting them on trays faster. No likes cold food unless it's meant to be cold.< /Review>

This is a pretty new Habit place along with this whole plaza so everything is really clean and neat. The service is good as well and all the items were well stocked when we went there. There is plenty of parking in the lot although could be packed at times with the 24hr fitness.< /text>

Like others have said, this place is waaay better than In-N-Out. The meat patties are thick, great quality, juicy and full of flavor. Plus they have the usual sodas plus strawberry lemonade with cucumbers and other drinks with a condiment bar of 3 different peppers. This place is above all other places I've been to and is reasonably priced. Will be coming her a lot more from now on.</Review>

The Habit Burger, imo, is better than In N Out. This location is excellent. It's pretty large inside with plenty of seating. There's also a large outdoor seating area as well, so you can enjoy eating in the cool evening.
As for the food, the hamburger  was excellent. The meat was so hot and juicy, not dry. Fries  were equally delicious, and not too salty.
They have shakes here too if you want a desert drink.
The cashier guy was very friendly, all the staff will greet yo<//Text>

<Text>And yet, another gourmet burger establishment. It's not unique but the flavors we're good and it was a juicy burger unlike some places. There were some different combos of ingredients to try there but the cheeseburger was certainly tasty. Something to give in and out a run for their money<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dd271158d01031:0xbb6a1f47dbcedbc5< /GmapID></record>

I would rate In n Out higher but it was not bad. Cost is very high, over 12 dollars for a single cheeseburger. Onion rings and a shake.< /Text>

<text>I was there on 5-13 20min till closing and there were hardly any ppl there. Tell me why my food took forever to come out? And the buns to my burger were burnt. I'll tell you why because the damn staff was too busy screwing around laughing yelling and making a ton of noise. It was a horrible experience.< /text>< pics>

We ordered 3x meals (fries and drink included), they input 2x meals and a sandwich + extra fries + extra drink!

The foods quality are okay but not special. Bunz in Bella Terra are significantly cheaper and also taste better.

We live very close to this one but probably never come back again.<//text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>First of all, this year they took out pinks hot dogs, they were to die for they took you back to the old days when a hot dog was a real hot dog. Second they replaced it with smash hamburgers which is just expensive and the people in the back cant even boil water or get your order right.

For the casino itself, is okay with lots of tight video poker, some what okay slots,    most of the time only one poker table most of the time( very good bonuses and 10$ an hour just for sitting there) and decent table games with decent rating system, much better then vegas harrahs propertys.

Most important only bring what your willing to lose and leave the atm and credit cards at home and if your staying there space your time out by taking regular breaks to walk around or watch tv.

The pools are nice and if you like to hike there is a trail out back and fishing close by with good weather all year around.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Loved the grilled chicken sandwhich on a french roll with terriaki sauce, lettuce and tomatoes .. The chicken was VERY tender and juicy and the French roll was surprisingly soft. PERFECT !  Yummmm.</text>

Burger was good, table was dirty. They need to clean tables on a regular basis. No customer should have to sit down to eat at a table that still has bits of food from the last customer on it.</Text>
