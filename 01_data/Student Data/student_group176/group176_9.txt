<Text>Walked in to get an estimate on my first tattoo so I decided to stay local and give this shop a try. Unfortunately when walked in for pricing the guy simply led me towards  computer typed my message and didn't even acknowledge my first question. I then asked if I could add a symbol he angrily got on computer and looked up image as he threw the mouse towards me. I felt uncomfortable at that point and said maybe I need to wait and his response WAS MAYBE YOU NEED TO DO RESEARCH. It is extremely disrespectful that on my first experience trying to get a tattoo people act rude and as if they are doing you a favor when I'm seeking their business you would think there would be more customer service. Anyways don't come here very dissatisfied.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I wanted to get my first tattoo and this place was highly recommended.  I met with the owner Leslie and she made me feel so comfortable that I booked my appointment on the spot.  Besides her professionalism what impressed me the most was how clean the place was!! It was impeccable. They are taking their profession very seriously and most importantly proper protocols during Covid times.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone testing the waters in the tattoo world.  It will be a great experience.</text>

So I went in July 2nd to get my upper lip pierced. Emo is the person who helped and left my piercing slanted and off entered.

I went back today, 7/7/20 to get it fixed and Emo helped me once more. This time he pierced it straight but off centered. His question to me... “isn’t it centered?” So after getting stabbed with a needle for the second time, he took it off and told me to let it heal and come back. Both times his attitude was as if he was not interested at all and didn’t want to be there, let alone be helping me fix his mistake. I’m out $40 and no piercing to show for it. I will definitely not be going back a third time! I’ve had many piercings before, and this was by far the worst experience. I’m sure there are lots of talented people in that shop, but I would definitely not recommend Emo to pierce anyone.< /Text>

<Review>I saw Chavo for my septum piecing (my first piercing) it was quick and well priced. Shortly after saw Burner for a very meaningful tattoo that I needed to be perfect! He exceeded my expectations. Well priced and the staff is very friendly. Most definitely recommend to EVERYONE considering this place!< /Review>< user>

Cool guys but they have no professional ethics towards there business. A bit over price so I suggest bargain for a decent price. I would suggest having a bit consideration towards the customer and what they want, and to show a bit of perseverance to the finish product.<//text>

I read shop reviews online and not much negativity so I went in on saturday to get my septum pierced was tended to by Ivan, thats what he told me his name was and what his card read. He and the place were overall very clean, hygienic, hence the 1 star. But the piercing he did was TERRIBLY CROOKED, WAAAAY OFF/ SLANTED. It looked ok at first when it was flipped down but i went in the next day on sunday to get a smaller hoop jewelry for it to make it easier to flip up for work. I again was tended to by Ivan, he went ahead and changed the hoop for a smaller one and flipped it up himself and shamelessly charged me another 15$, (i dont mind paying for a good job but this was the second time him having an opportunity to look at his terrible work, hes still stayed quiet and didnt alert me of his horrid job) Once i got home i noticed myself it was completely crooked and slanted. I had to get a second opinion as to what to do, went to another shop and there they told me the obvious that they had indeed done a HORRIBLE JOB AT SIN CITY, and that they recommended me take the jewelry completely off, clean and let it heal, then go back to repierce in anout 3-4 weeks time. And theres my review wish it couldve been a good one, but i feel people need to know the truth and have above all professionalism, honesty and experince from the people we trust to pierce us or tattoo us.
WILL NEVER BE RETURNING TO SIN CITY FOR ANYTHING.< /Text>< Time>

First off the dude named Frank is completely unprofessional, he was high when we went in and never gave a set price when the deposit was made and turned me down because I thought the tattoo was going to be cheaper instead of negotiating with me, m.f wasted my time and caught really bad attitude, like I said completely unprofessional, t his place is not recommended for anyone<//Review>

Recently dined here and had the surf and turf plate. It consists of two skewers, one steak and one shrimp. It also comes with seasoned rice and roasted vegetables. There are two small pieces of pita bread and tzatziki sauce. The food was good, but the steak was a bit too chewy, at least some  of it was. The total tab with tax came to about $18.<//review>

Today I tried their Greek salad for the first time and absolutely loved it. The cashier who helped us was helpful and very friendly. This is a great casual place to grab a great tasting meal. We are moving out of the area in a few days but I definitely plan to go back one last time.< /Review>< pics>

We have been here at work developing options that are a modern take on what the “original Daphne’s” served as we understand that there are many loyal guests who enjoyed us when the concept was first created. Please send me your ideas to tsalazar@daphnes.biz and I will happily discuss with our corporate menu development team. Thank you for your feedback.\n\nTim Salazar'}<//Resp>
<review>This place has changed since the franchise was sold. Menu is challenging to understand, food was just ok. There are lots of better Greek options that would not leave you wanting... #bringgeorgeback</review>< userid>

Gyros were exceptionally good. Lemon-egg soup was very tasty. Good menu choices at reasonable prices. Quick and pleasant service.</review>

I always love Daphne's chicken lemon soup.  I also ordered a children's falafel meal for my kid, but the falafel was a little too greasy.  Another pet peeve, as this was a take out order, was they forgot to give me the milk that I paid for with the kid's meal. I didn't realize until I got home, so it wasn't worth it to go back.<//review>

Daphne's is great no matter which one you visit but this particular location was exceptionally delicious. I had the falafel pita and it was wonderful. Fresh veggies and pita plus the most perfect crispy on the outside warm on the inside falafel balls.  Yumm!<//review>

<Text>Food was burnt took about 30 minutes to actually get when I got my food it was cold didn't look good. Customer service is terrible the night shift is horrible Hugo always has an attitude. For being slow it shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes. They always get my order wrong and I probably won't ever come back here. I want my money back because this isn't the first time this has happened.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Would give 0 star if could! Just had dinner and found LIVE BUGS in our salad. Bug crawling around on the plate. Hugo who says he’s the manager laughed and told us “the lettuce comes to us that way”. He laughed more and argued that’s the way lettuce is when we asked for some kind of compensation. Offered nothing, not even an apology!< /Review>< pictures>

The food is fine, but the wait can be absurdly long for what it is. I've had a couple of times where I've gone in with a group and have had a 45 minute wait between ordering our food and having it served to us.< /Review>

Great food but the costumer serves was horrible cashier had no one in line but us and didn’t want to wait for us to make a decision left the front and went to the back tuck so long that the cook had to go get him once we placed are order the cashier as really rude and even when we thanked him he still didn’t respond or acknowledged us bad service to the max and will not be coming here any longer.< /Review>

I had recently brought my PC in when it was failing to start up. I was helped by Jesse, who was very informative and professional — He did diagnostics on my PC and was able to provide me with several options. I decided that I had wanted to build a new PC to which he was also able to help me with. We were able to get the parts ordered and my new PC built. Since then, my new PC has been great and running very well. Thank you for all the help< /Review>< UserId.>

Our laptop could not be turned on
We went to this store and informed diagnosis done with 1-2 business days

After two days no response and school will start next day. We went to the store and the manager said still on the waiting list and not showing any sorry sign

We decided to take our laptop back and called my friend who recommended this store to us

We won’t want to enter this store and see that innocent face nothing wrong with them attitude

Cheap is not good on service quality< /Text>
<response>{'time': 1610139507044, 'text': 'Your review comes at a shock. Jesse clearly explained we have a free 2 day diagnostic to which you agreed. I do wish we were informed upon check-in that you needed a rush so your son would have his computer for school. Jesse would have gladly accommodated.\n\nWhen you decided to pick up early Jesse loaned you a tool so you could swap out the battery yourself at home. You said you’d return the tool and bring back the computer for us to fix. I am very confused by your review. You were not charged at any point.\n\nRegardless we are extremely sorry you had a bad experience with us. Jesse will be contacting you to resolve the situation.'}</response><gmapID>0x808fccbd28ce1c73:0x939d12dfa19eaacc<//gmapID>< rating>

Jeremy the day after I purchased the remote service and within a few of hours my laptop was fixed. I had quite few viruses and once they were removed my laptop was back to normal. Great experience and recommend Jeremy's expertise if you're having computer issues.</Text>

<name>bruce chia<//name><review>Reasonable price for checking custom build PC issues. Gave detailed feedback about what could be wrong, what tools they tried (such thermometer gun) although they did not have enough time to determine if it's motherboard or cpu issue or both.

Would recommend parking next to the park nearby and walking over if driving over as it's hard to stop directly outside their shop.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Time>1599963683580</Time></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The guys there are very nice and helpful. I sent my desktop to the shop today because it couldn't connect to a monitor. I thought the problem might be some loose connections inside of the desktop. It turns out the monitor should be connected to graphic card directly instead of mother board. And they didn't charge me anything because nothing needs to be fixed.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fccbd28ce1c73:0x939d12dfa19eaacc< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had a good experience with The Cheap Quad. I have been there twice and I could say they are so amazing. I have always walked away 101% happy and satisfied with their service.

I first used their service last year when I had an issue with my fan. Yes they were able to fix it within 2 days. The second time was last week after I accidentally dropped my laptop from my lap. Cracked screen, malfunctioned software and I couldn't even shut it down. They are so professional because they were able to find the problems so fast and I got my laptop over the weekend. Thanks to the whole team!

Service price was reasonable and they were great at calling and updating customers about the status of their devices. I am so glad having them as my laptop repair team and it feels so good knowing someone I can trust with.<//review>

The Cheap Squad is an awesome place to get your computer, cellphones and tablets repaired. Fast and Reliable are the first 2 words that come to mind when describing The Cheap Squad, even before the word cheap!</text>

<Review>Great guys!  My daughters built a desktop and could not get it to boot up.  After a lot of frustration and tears, they decided to take it to The Cheap Squad.  Turns out that they had not plugged something in to the power supply, as it usually is with these builds, the simplest mistake!  The Cheap Squad did a free diagnosis and actually fixed the problem.  No charge.  They could have charged for their time and we would have been happy to pay it to have it work.  We will definitely use them for any computer issues in the future!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fccbd28ce1c73:0x939d12dfa19eaacc</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Oh me, oh my, Mr. Joshua is one hell of a guy!
Brought my old IPhone 7 plus because I spilled coffee all over it. Josh explained everything in advance, and got it done. My new "go to" place.</Review>

The Cheap Squad are the best.  We have had three computers fixed by them over the last couple of years, they do not charge too much but do a wonderful job!  If you go to Staples or Best Buy they want about $300 just to look at a computer, these guys don't charge anything until they have looked to see what needs doing.  Then they let you know cost and it's your decision whether to have it fixed...

I would recommend them every time.  Reliable, honest, and do a great job.< /review>

Wow what great service!  I really felt like I was in good hands when handing over my computer.  They really took the time to explain what was wrong and what needed to be fixed.  Quick, professional, and affordable!< /Review>

I frantically explained how terribly urgent my situation was. Josh heard me, and not only did he jump on my iPad right away but gave me a laptop to work on while I waited to see if my device could be fixed. Not 30 mins later my iPad was cleaner and worked much better than before. Thank you Cheap Squad and a special thanks to Josh.<//review>< Pictures>

Excellent customer service. Reliable. Anyone with a computer problem should go there. No charge for diagnosis. Will let you know the problem and cost to fix upfront. No hidden costs, no pressure.< /text>

<text>Very knowledgeable and helpful staff.  I came in here a while ago with my laptop, complaining about a loose power jack since my laptop wouldn’t charge.  They called me back ahead of schedule and explained there was nothing wrong with the power jack after they looked inside.  As it turns out, I needed a new charger.  They have this policy that they will only bill you if they fix something.  So I got my laptop back and I didn’t have to pay anything!  I hope I’ll never need the services of Cheap Squad again, but if I do this is where I’m coming.<//text>< Pics>

Best customer service ever! Super helpful and friendly staff helped me find the perfect jeans and even offered discounts on the ones I wanted. I'll probably come by again next time I go over the Grapevine. Definitely worth the stop if you're passing through.</Text>

They do not honor their prices marked on tag! Found Jean's on clearance and they decided to try to charge me double the price even after I pointed out their tag . Needless to say I did not buy the pants and I will not be shopping here again .< /Text>

<Review>They didn't have the my size at their store so the manager Anne ordered some them from the Tulare store. I never recieved an receipt or email. It has been two weeks and I haven't received my shorts but my card was charged. I drove 45 minutes to the store today and they claim the shorts were received the day after they were purchased. They would not send me new shorts or refund me. I left empty handed. I order stuff online constantly and don't have any problems receiving them from other stores.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Very Well Customer Service. The Store Associates exceeded my expectations. The Store Manager deserves a recognition for how good the Store is ran. Definitely coming back!<//Review>

It's been so long ago, there wasn't even internet. I've studied there in 1995. Why not leaving my impression? I can say it was much more than just an English course. It has changed my life. I was 2 and spent 3 months there. Great experience! Excellent books, methods and teachers. Definitely recommend them. I want to visit one day. By the photos it is quite the same. Happy environment. Of course a business open for over 30 years can only be very good.< /text>

#Flashback I was in San Diego, California for 5 months improving my English from February 11 to July 1, 2018. IT was just AMAZING. The city is wonderful, where you can visit a lot of beautiful places and meet a lot of people. I lived in little Italy and went to Converse in Downtown. I had received recommandations from 3 friends who have studied here, and they were right ; It is probably the best school in SD.

First of all, the staff is very friendly and always available. Tamara, the director of the school, is always here if you need help. Joseph, is at the same time the Assistant Academic Manager and an excellent teacher (I was lucky to follow his lessons for 3 months) too. If you have any question, you can ask Heather at the reception, she is always smiling and happy. Sonya is the activities coordinator, thanks to her, I could do skydiving and surfing. She is so sweet !

Finally, Jessica will help you if you want to change classes or lessons. During these 5 months, I definitely improved my English, because of the lesson's quality and the availability of the staff when you want to practice, practice and practice your english :) So don't be shy and talk with them because they could give you a lot of advice about food, places and activities !

For all of the reasons, I definitely recommend you CISL and San Diego. It was the best experience of my life ; I have realized my dream of living in the US for a while, and I don't have regrets, or, maybe yes, just one : I should have stayed more time ! I miss these guys, and I will be back soon to visit them !

See you soon CISL

<Text>I have the best time studying with Converse! Met so many nice students and most of them I keep in contact ( and it was 5 years ago). I always say I wish I could be back to that time.
I had the best teachers. Lovely and very patience.

<date>1519115130426< /date><review>It was totally amazing experiences in San Diego! I could have so many chances to practice English with teachers and classmates. Cause there were only 4 students in my class! That was unbelievable!
I took Cambridge English classes at Converse and I would highly recommend this class for everyone who would like to learn and practice English properly. It was great opportunity to improve my speaking, listening and writing skills. Thanks to my teacher Joseph (I miss you so bad Joseph! You are the best teacher ever I have met.. seriously) I could feel confident and get used to using proper English as time went by.
I think I was so fortunate to get really good memories there. I miss all of you! Especially so many activities with Sonya were definitely unforgettable experiences for me. She was so friendly and nice. Converse has so good Activity plans and they try to make it every month differently for all of the students. Those were so enjoyable and I had fun with Sonya! I hope I can visit there again someday and have fun with teachers once again. Take care, guys!<//review>< user_name>

I was at the CISL from March 2018 to June 2018 and I had such a good time. I was in the Cambridge Course (FCE) and I had the best teacher ever. Joseph help us with everything and I felt never lost or uncomfortable. The activities with the school are super cool and all the people are very kind and helpful. I would recommend the CISL to everyone how wants to go to San Diego in a language school. It was one of the best experience in my life.</Text>

On the one hand, Converse International School of Language is a very serious and very concerned about their students and about increase their english level. On the other hand, CISL is an amaziong school where they worry a lot to show you the city organizing extra activities for free in the afternoon where you have the posibility to continue practicing English with more international students and teachers at the same time you do amazing things around the city.
Thanks for everything and I hope to come back next year!< /review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) We are French and our children have been participating in the Converse International School of Language junior summer camps for several years. They usually leave for 3 weeks in July and always come back delighted… with a great American accent. Since 2015, they have stayed at the Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New Haven campuses. The next trip will certainly be to San Diego. I would add that they never wanted to go to the same campus together so as not to be tempted to stay together. On the other hand, during each stay they befriended other young people from all continents and several years later, they still correspond with some.
CISL's programs are well balanced with English classes in the morning and activities in the afternoon. The price of the internships is not excessive because the courses are of high quality, the supervision is very friendly and the accommodation on the university campuses is great. Most importantly, our kids loved going to amusement parks, exploring Hollywood, surfing in Santa Monica, and sightseeing in New York or San Francisco.
In short, at the end of a stay at the ICFTU, the children speak English, learn more about American culture and have had the best vacation of their lives. A great experience!

Last clarification: for those under 15 who are traveling as Unaccompanied minors with Air France, Converse sends a manager to the airport to pick up the young person on arrival. For the others a taxi awaits them. Everything is planned!

(Original)
Nous sommes français et nos enfants participent aux camps d’été juniors de Converse International School of Language depuis plusieurs années. Ils partent en général 3 semaines au mois de juillet et reviennent toujours enchantés…avec un super accent américain. Depuis 2015, ils ont séjourné sur les campus de Washington, de Los Angeles, de San Francisco et de New Haven. Le prochain voyage sera certainement pour San Diego. Je précise qu’ils n’ont jamais voulu partir ensemble sur un même campus pour ne pas être tentés de rester entre eux. Par contre, à chaque séjour ils se sont liés d’amitié avec d’autres jeunes venus de tous les continents et  plusieurs années après, ils correspondent encore avec certains.
Les programmes du CISL sont bien équilibrés avec des cours d’anglais le matin et des activités l’après-midi. Le prix des stages n’est pas excessif car les cours sont de grande qualité, l’encadrement est très sympa et l’hébergement dans les campus des universités est génial. Mais surtout, nos enfants ont adoré les sorties dans les parcs d’attraction, la découverte d’Hollywood, le surf à Santa Monica et les visites de New York ou de San Francisco.
En résumé, à la fin d’un séjour au CISL, les enfants parlent anglais, connaissent mieux la culture américaine et ont passé les plus belles vacances de leur vie. Une super expérience !

Dernière précision : pour les – de 15 ans qui voyagent en mineurs Non Accompagnés avec Air France, Converse envoie un responsable à l’aéroport pour récupérer le jeune à l’arrivée. Pour les autres un taxi les attend. Tout est prévu !</Review>

Couldn't even get a chance to purchase before I was treated rudely and when I decided to walk out the security guard tried to follow me and then gave me the finger when I said your service is terrible. This place most likely sells bootleg products. I wouldn't trust any company that tries to act like they can talk down to customers.<//Text>

Love stopping here when I am in L.A.  The selection and product never disappoints.  If you're uncertain about dosing or desired "experience" Chelsea is your girl.  She is knowledgeable and always friendly.  Her expertise makes all the difference when shopping for the right product.  Please bring back La Familia.  Love their edibles!<//Text>

The best dispensary in Los Angeles hands down. Sapphire is seriously the greatest & most professional. Actually knows she’s doing compared to a lot of other dispensaries out there. Can’t recommend enough.< /Text>

< review>
So overpriced!!!! Lazy staff, probably hate helping customers. Not honest about products. Asked for a tincture &  they said it not MADE ANYMORE in size I wanted. Sold me something 2X as expensive, said me it was "much'" better. It wasn't. Disgusting tasting, ridiculously hard to open top, which makes me nauseous. Gave to 2 friends, sick stomach too. Eighty two bucks wasted. Came back and same person said "yeah, lots of people complain about that one, but WE WERE OUT OF the one you wanted"! SO they DO still make it. They're close to home & open late, but had 3  experiences and all BAD. Already found several better places.<//review>

They also became Ruth Alternative Care when the Netflix series came out. So cool! 🤙✨</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Amazing place to be. Between the hugs and the nuggs I left feeling renewed and loved. If you’re near by, stop by. Even if you aren’t,... it’s worth the drive.</Review>< Pics>

The 1st dispensary I bought from & they sucked at service. Spoke to 2 sales ppl. Neither had much product knowledge. Talked to 2 others employees (not sales) & none seemed to like working there! Customers seemed an "inconvenience" to them. Buyers complained about the staff, which did nothing to improve it. So glad I found better places in the area.  Medmen is my fav. AHHS is probably cheaper, but selection is limited and staff sucks. You can do better than this place.<//Review>

Definitely better dispensaries around here... this one was way over priced. Kind of a long wait, 30 minutes, made sense because their check out process is long and they didnt have much staff working. There was a cool Disjointed Netflix show theme to the lobby but once you go through the door it ends. Don’t even get me started on the wax lookbook flipbook, also hope you’re a weed wiz before you come here because you’ll need to know what you want. The staff isn’t too suggestive or informative! I guess you could go to sign the cool board in the lobby and watch a disjointed episode while you wait, but that’s all I thought it was good for.< /review>

Great skating rink!  Reminded me of the skating rink I went to when I was a kid.  They even sell skates along with wheels, laces, stoppers, etc.< /review>

Fun for kids and adults...accommodating and friendly staff. The shoes can occasionally bite. The DJ was willing to quickly modify her list when I said it was my daughter's birthday.<//Review>

This place is great -- the atmosphere is awesome and quirky, people are friendly, and its an excellent date night. As others have mentioned, be sure to bring cash! If you have experience from another sport that requires balance, like ice skating or snowboarding, you might just be a natural. I plan to go back next time I'm in the city.< /Review>

<text>It's a throwback. Retro fun. Daughter had her first go around. And now she wants to go again. I will happily pay the $14 admission fee for the 2 hour open skate versus her playing more Minecraft. And I get to relive my youth, except with way worse knees.< /text>< userid>

< review>
I arrived at 9pm with my 11 year old daughter and my developmentally disabled sister-in-law in hopes of giving them a fun night out with the family. On Friday nights, they require ALL patrons to pay full admission ($19) regardless if you are going to skate or not (that means it would have cost $95 for two skaters, their elderly grandparents and a single adult to supervise).

I haven’t decided if this place is being used to launder money, or they simply don’t care about making a profit. Charging a smaller admission fee ($5?) for non-skaters would limit the place from turning into a playground while still creating a safe environment for youth in the community to hang out. There were a group of young ladies sitting in the outdated, wood paneled straight from the 70’s lobby who were denied entrance to their friend’s birthday party, despite the skating rink being almost empty.

The teenagers who work there shouldn’t have to hold the burden of management’s ridiculous rules and complaints from parents who don’t want to leave their children unattended. We definitely won’t be coming back.

Aside from non-existent customer service, the bathrooms were filthy and the strip club music left a lot to be desired.</review>

It's hard to find a skating rink nowadays...this is truly a diamond in the rough. If it took plastic (cash only, and of course they have their own atm) and if it were slightly more economical...like $160+ for 10 admission and rentals. No hats allowed in the establishment.</review>

<Review>This place is really old, but it's a lot of fun for kids. If they upgraded some of their seating area and decor, it would make a world of difference.

The Golden Skate is especially good for birthday parties. When you have one there, they take care of Pizza, cake, serving and cleanup.  It's not cheap, but it makes things very easy for parents.

Note that if you bring your own roller blades or skates, make sure you have wheels that are somewhat hard.  I used to play roller hockey and I have wheels rated at 72A.  The Golden State has a painted smooth surface, so I literally could not stop, my wheels would not skid at all, so it felt sticky to skate on their surface.  I have a set of outdoor wheels that are 85A and I think they would have been much better for this place.<//Review><user_name>Mako J< /user_name></record>

I had a blast with my kids and family even my 2 year old was able to skate! I am only giving them 4 instead of 5 stars because while picking out our skate sizes they did not have 3 out of our 6 sizes and we had to wait and return at the end we ended up just having to get out money back on one set because they never had the size.<//Review>

This place could be awesome.  Saturday night's there's no DJ. The music sucks. They hardly ever turn the lights off. The floors are worn down. There's always stuff on the skate floor.  Very disappointing.<//Text>

I took my two teen kids and one of their friends here. It was my first visit. I gladly paid for the kids and told the cashier I was only there to watch my kids skate. She said that was no problem, but when I tried to go inside, I was stopped, with a kid telling me I can't come in without a wrist band...which costs $14 bucks.

I spoke with the manager, and she told me I have to pay to watch my kids skate. I paid and went inside, and then I spoke with the manager again, telling her it was poor business to charge a parent to simply come in and watch their kids skate. She told me that I was "free to leave anytime," if I didn't like it...After I Paid!

So she waited for me to pay to just watch my kids skate, and then told me to leave if I didn't like it!

What a SORRY place this is! Avoid it like the plague!</review>

<text>It was decent. they should re-do the skate floor. There were a few bumps in the rink. Also, what's the reason for the police officer outside in the parking lot, the searching through bags, and a metal detector? It was off they were trying to send a message, one with certain undertones.  I'm not sure I will be back per se. It rubbed me the wrong way.<//text><Date>1615304079458</Date>< Name>

Nice place to go to with friends or for a date. Friendly atmosphere, especially for those just learning to skate. Check their website to make sure you arrive near the beginning of a skate session, or else you might only get to skate for an hour or less. There's a little snack bar that serves typical bowling alley food. It's pretty pricey; expect to pay $15-20 for admission and rental.< /text>

<Review>Took a few of the Saturday all-ages lessons to get back into skating; totally worth it to get a little advice and lots of rink-time when falling is expected, getting my wheels back under me.  I think the few kids at this lesson time liked skating rings around my friend and I.  Finally started feeling confident enough to stay for most of the free following session and I'm really glad to have come back.  Not too crowded on a Saturday early afternoon, quite a work-out, good fun like I remember from back in the day.  Almost brave enough to hit an adult night.< /Review><GmapID>0x808ff2d099a2b65d:0x4b88b4e9f7bf6994</GmapID><Date>1342497759335</Date><response>None< /response><user_name>Sidhe Unseelie< /user_name><rate>5< /rate>< userid>

<review>Like most of the other comments, owner is rude!!!!!!!
I was dropping my kids of for a birthday party. I had...prepare yourself for the trauma...a hat on. Yes, people I had a hat on. After 2 employees bothered me, then The owner, guessing it's the owner, some older guy, comes yelling at me in front of everyone and my kids. " get out, no hats!!!!" Over and over again. I said I'm leaving in a few minutes and I'm not skating, please stop doing this in front of my kids. " teach your kids how to respect rules, take off your hat!!" I walk away to take my 7 year old to get a skate mate, he comes flying over..." no, they get nothing!!!" He yelled it several times. They refused to give. Kid a skate mate. Thank fully we had brought our own skates. I would have taken my kids out, but it was a birthday party, I didn't want them to miss hanging out with friends.
By the way, there was another man in there with a hat on, not sure why it was ok for him but an issue when I did. I was there for 10 minutes and then left once my kids saw the rest of the group. Another parents got a skate mate for my kid.
Don't bother with this place!!!!!!!!! Old, worn down anyway. We will not return, ever.<//review>< pics>

Sunday afternoons can be a little wild with the small "speed-bump" kids and their roller frames to help them skate, but at least it keeps most of them upright.  Decent varied musical selections and they will take requests. Wednesday night adult skate is crowded but terrific senior skaters are very safe if you are more of a beginner.  Overall, nice folks and a diverse crowd.<//text>

I have been twice in last two weeks. Nice folks I have dealt with. I really like the floor but not the newer age music, I am used to the older jam skate music. Anyhow it seems to be a nice mix of folks younger and older. I do like the dress code being enforced.<//review>

Really wish they would play more upbeat music on adult night and have more that one adult only skate night. I went on a Sat night after one of the staff members recommended it for better music but it was terrible!! Yes, the music was better but it was too crowded with a lot of people who couldn't skate and tons of little kids. (Keep in mind I went to the 8:30pm-11pm session) I would have expected kids that little to be at home and getting ready for bed or asleep. I grew up in the area and I would 100% say Golden Skate was waaaaaaaay better back in the day!</Review>

Every other month our family gets together for some type of activity.  This time we chose The Golden Skate. The music selection was not exciting and the music was too slow most times. The atmosphere was fun, the staff were friendly and the No sagging pants rules were good and funny. Their website and phone instructions were misleading and if you aren't careful you'll get ripped off.  Their website states that there is a $13 admission fee whether you skate or not. The cashier only asks you how many people not how many people are skating. We had a group of 8 adults and 5 children. After speaking with the manager we were refunded our admission fee for 4 adults. And the snack bar prices were extremely high priced and cash only! However, you can pay the entrance fee with credit.<//text>

This place is ok. I took away a few stars bc they charge $14 for a parent who accompany his/her children. Although I didn't skate, I had to pay to sit and watch my child. Was not happy.< /review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>From the time I got to the door it was an awful experience! The girl at the booth asked me how many tickets I wanted I said 2. How many to skate 1! She asked me again then charged me wrong. Then charged me again! Gave me no  receipt, went to get my skates and was told no. Then I was stoped by some old man who told me she gave me one. I went to the booth she told me she gave it to me and the old nan said I was cause a problem and he was going to kick me out!  They never offered an apology and afterwords the girl said she gave the receipt to the second person even though I paid her with a credit card.  I calmly asked her why did she give my receipt to someone else when I paid her she couldn't answer, but I was the one causing the problem that needed to be kicked out.  The old man got Mad game he five dollars out of his pocket and said you want to argue over five dollars !  And then they proceeded to harass my kids. My daughter came in for her birthday with about 15 other kids they got a lot of money out of us tonight and we got nothing but problems in trouble. 😤< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>This place does not offer good customer service at all. Im actually surprised to see that they are still in business. In this day and time with all the competition to buy key real estate and to have the owner/manager walk up completely ignore you as you stand in the window attempting to get his attention. Then over hear him mention to another mgr how people like me don't understand good English. Dont understand the rules. After I'm clearly stating that I've never been hear before as i spoke to my children who are confused as to what's going on.

I have three children. As a parent I'm always looking for great locations share with others. This is not one that I would recommend. There should be a class held here on customer retention and customer service as of right this establishment is lacking in both areas.
There are other skating rinks that are in the Bay Area my suggestion would to be to look elsewhere.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I take my daughters there regularly (aged 10 and 13) and we always have a good time.  The owner has made many improvements in the last year or two -- and we have never had a negative experience there.  We usually attend the 6:30-9 sessions where there are younger kids.  The 9-11 sessions tend to have an older crowd.  Don't usually go to the early sessions, but I've heard they are good for beginners.  Come check it out!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

<text>The worst rink! The owner is SO rude to his patrons and employees. We got out and skated for about tens minutes before he was yelling at us for stopping and threatening to throw us out. Very small on the inside. The owner scolded all of the women in the party. SO rude. Do not go here. Antioch is WAY better.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None<//Response><pictures>None<//pictures><review>Been skating for about an hour, I go to get a slice at the snack bar. Then while watching my friends skate I hear a gruff voice say "you need to put something on!". I turn to a midle aged guy crossing his arms at me and looking mad. I look down at my long pants and tank top (halter top with sports bra, no belly exposed) and say "excuse me?" He says I need to cover up there's a dress code. (I saw the sign by the door, the picture was a girl in tiny shorts & a crop top)I look over the the woman next to me, also in a back-bearing tank top and say "what about her?" He says no it's different just you. There's women skating around in crop tops with their full stomachs showing. I've been skating for an hour, I'm buying food at the snack bar, and there's other women more exposed than me. He could have been nice and not shamed me for what I was wearing, or not singled me out. Oh! It was also 9pm at an adult roller disco night. There were NO children even in the building. I told him I was going to finish the pizza slice I paid for, then I'll go sweat to death in the sweatshirt I had, and leave a bad review. He stood over me and glared until I finished my pizza. Pretty much ruined my experience.< /review><name>Zoe L< /name>< user_id>

The rink is pretty old. I would not be surprised if it has changed in ages. It has a snack stand and arcade games. They play music loud and have flashing lights to set the mood. They have skate mates so kids can learn to skate. The place has an expensive entry price of $14 during weekend days but we all had fun!< /Text>

Couldn’t even get in to be able to skate. They have this unwritten dress code of “no hats, no “see thru” shirts (meaning white shirts), & no strapless tops”, most likely even more dress codes that we just weren’t informed about. It wouldve been helpful if they had some rules writen on their website so I could’ve known before driving 30 minutes to get there & not being let in.</text>

DJ led one game the entire skate session. Emphasized a very strict dress code but unfortunately was not enforced. The surface and skates were fine.< /Text>

Horrible owner ...nasty attitude! Holes all in the floor.  Dangerous, kids falling because of holes.  Nasty bathrooms. I don't recommend! Ruined my granddaughter's birthday.  All the parents said they won't come back.<//Text>

Very unprofessional management, me and my family got to the rank at 7:45. And was not informed of the sessions policy they use. So after the season was over I talked to the manager. And he said pay or get out. I asked why didn't they say anything at the time I was paying. He then said they dont have to pay or get out. After spending $51.00 I had to pay 16 more only reason I stayed was for my son.<//Text>

<Text>This place is an absolute rip off. I had my Daughters Birthday here. I pre paid $300 plus dollars,. As I was getting ready to leave a young employ there ask me if I'd like to discuss the bill now, I was confused being that everything was already paid for.. So he pulls out the receipt, and on it was $45 additional  dollars for the walkers to help beginner skaters. They apparently charge $5 dollars for one of these cheap little plastic walkers. It wouldn't of been such a big deal if they would have informed me about this from the beginning but they didn't . In my opinion it should be included in the Birthday package.
Also a couple of the employs were rude..< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating><gmap_id>0x808ff2d099a2b65d:0x4b88b4e9f7bf6994</gmap_id>< Pictures>

A good place to go if you have no where else with a smooth floor to skate. It's a pretty small rink so it gets kind of crowded, especially on Sundays. A lot of really little kids, which is great if you have kids, but if you're an adult it's a bit of a challenge trying to dodge all the little ones - either stopping or going the wrong direction. It has the same feel as a bowling alley, a little dingey and under staffed, but it works. Dress code is also a little strict. No midrift showing allowed, no hats. They have both rollerskates and rollerblades to rent. 13$ for entry and $5 for skate rental. Also make sure to bring lots of quarters if you plan on using the little cubbies for your stuff (your outside shoes,wallet, keys,ect.)< /text>

Witnesses a man being harassed for wearing a hat and treated like a criminal is beyond me. A warning should have been given due to the fact of no hats allowed not calling the cops and having him and the whole party thrown out!
I WILL NOT RETURN AND I WILL NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE I KNOW TO AND THE PRICE IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!<//text>

Took take my 10 year old son and a my girlfriend and her sister there on Sunday for all you can eat pizza 3/26/17. We planned the day to this event so we didn't eat and figured we eat and skate there. Now when we get there they have this policy about hats, no hats allowed.. I figured there'd be no pro Len since I'm an older guy and the hate is apart of my faith (Rastafari). So this older man maybe 70ish says no hats! I explained it was religious and he asked me what religion and I told he and he said he never heard of it and started to walk away. Then my girlfriend asked what was the reason for no hates he just said because it's on the sign and just closed the door on us and walked away. Not polite very rude and then I had to explain this to the kids. Whatever the reason for their policy I don't know but they could have explained themselves as I did when asked my reason for a hat. My son was upset and didn't understand so I had to explain to him about integrity and discrimination. This place gets zero stars from me and I will never return and I'd hope that if you read this you'd not go there either. A place like this should not operate and stay in business when they are rude to customers and can't give a good reason for what they do. I will be escalating this to more levels such as the news. Maybe no big deal to you but for me and my family it is! Do not support this place!</Text>

<text>I thought this was a nice roller rink and the kids loved it, but that place just scares you going inside. You have signs saying no hats and other stupid rules then u have a damn security guard checking people as if he was a TSA Agent..i mean is this a place for kids or a place for violence..this roller rink needs to do a better job at welcoming people not scaring people with rules and security. And the older white guy i dont know if hes the owner but he kind of guards the enterance give off the impression as if he doesnt care for colored people. Im not black but am colored and i was treated like a criminal while taking my two kids (5yr and 6yr old) to skate there.<//text>< pics>

<Text>I wish I could give less stars. We went with kids and they weren't allowing us inside without paying 18$ even though we weren't skating. Once we went inside, they didn't accept credit cards, so I wanted to go to my car to get cash and they said I have pay again for re-entry . It was a nightmare experience with horrible support staff. Wouldn't recommend and would never go back again, especially with kids.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>This place is nothing like I remember as a kid in '78 - '80. Back then the Golden Skate ruled! All of us Danville and San Ramon kids spent many good hours skating on Friday nights. I suppose things change, kids dont seem to be interested in skating anymore. One thing that hasent changed is the carpet. Vintage '70s.<//Text>< rate>

My family & friends have come here for the past 11 months. BUT today there is a security guard checking bags & not allowing my water bottle nor any snacks be brought in. (*Said snacks are for my food allergy child.) It's actually against the law, ADA, to do this! Golden Skate just lost my business.<//review>

I visit this place a lot since I work in the area. I got to say their service is always good and they keep the place neat constantly. Prices are affordable and they serve generous portions.< /Review>

< Review>
After one drink in the w hotel, we tried to visit the frolic room at 10 PM on a Sunday and were asked to leave before we got one drink by some extremely rude bartender!  Apparently this establishment doesnt serve people who have plenty of money and are ready to have a good time. Major bummer on my trip to LA. Back to the W hotel lobby! Dont waste your time!<//Review>

Cool place and although it's at the back of a hard to find parking lot...the view there can be very pleasing (to the male eye) where you can also enjoy a beer or hard alcohol (or a "massage" next door after a few drinks) ;-) and there's a nice smoke shop right there too!</text>

<text>I made an appointment online to get a troublesome tire looked at and repaired. I had stopped in a few times to get air added, and they were always courteous and quick. Came in for the appointment and was told 30-45 minutes. I made sure to ask when the vehicle would be taken back because 30-45 minutes from when you walk in the door and when the vehicle actually gets up on the rack are totally different. I was told it would go back shortly, so I said I would wait. An hour later, I see it get pulled in. Nobody ever came to check in or give any updates about wait time. Another 20 minutes later the rep checks me out. I sign for it, and have to ask what they found on it. The repair was free of charge, which is nice. The shop was clean and waiting area was comfortable. They provide WiFi so I was able to at least get some schoolwork done while waiting.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Very nice ,caring people, I had to get new wheel, do to another place not tightening the lug nuts on one side so it wrecked the wheel. We bought new ones, after my son applied for credit to pay for them. One gentleman told the cashier to make sure she adjusted the amt.of credit line so that the credit bureaus wouldnt ding his score. They made sure that the line of credit was extended more on paper. I thought it was really nice for them to care. They got a sale ,so they really didnt have to. Nice job!!< /text>< pics>

Took my 2015 Chrysler 200 with a flat tire. They came running to greet me at the parking lot. (since I have never been here before I thought he was trying to tell me they were almost closed) John assured he will get this sorted for me. Minutes later I drove out with an used tire, installed to get me through. Nate explained it was free of cost and gave me a quote for a new tire, even though it was after closing hours......I was in awe! It took me a while to realize this was really happening. Talk about customer service...it can't get better than this! They called me the next morning as per my request with a better deal for a tire! They were not trying to push or sell anything, genuinely helpful!! VERY HELPFUL, COURTEOUS, POLITE & PROFESSIONAL!!!!<//Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>Les Schwab continues to amaze me with their FANTASTIC customer service.

They maintain a database about their customer vehicles that they can access from any store.  They know what has been repaired or installed, and what might need to be serviced.

Honestly, these folks have fixed flats for me, done inspections and repairs, and (I hesitate to say this) most work was free or low cost.

Yup, their plan worked, I am a customer for life, and highly recommend them.

Les Schwab, stay the way you are...  you've done a great job.< /Text>< pictures>

If i could give the Reedley les shwab no stars i would. The wanted me to pay to change my brake calipers and it didn't need to be changed. They wanted to charge me $532 parts and labor. Im on a fixed budget. After that i told them i couldn't afford it at the time and the man told me "ok now we got to put the tires back on" as though i shouldnt have wasted there time if i wasnt going to fix the brakes right there and then. Somewhat rude. I had a family friend change my brakes and rotors for $170 parts and labor after all.</review>

I took my 2001 Chevy S10 Xtreme in for a FREE brake check and the performed past my expectations and explained the reasons all my problems I was having and gave me a FREE quote for all the parts I need. For a full repair or replacement service on all my brakes was quoted for $198.71 for all of them. An alignment repair with the part I need is $177 and some-odd cents. All of the crew was extremely helpful and and very well mannered. I am more than Satisfied with the service they provided.<//text>

It's ok as tire as tire shops go but you better be ready for a heavy upsell. It's one thing to find needed items that need replacing or repairing and bringing it to the customers attention. But I would bet that everyone who goes in will be told that they need something else besides what they came in for! To some of you that may be a good thing to others not, you decide. The work that they do for you is good they are not cheating anyone it's just do you really need it!< /text>

<Text>Eh....I stopped by once just to check it out, and hmm...well anyways the attendent or what ever you call them, pretty much gave me your everyday talk, it went somewhere like this” what brings you in today” so I just told them, that i was getting low tire pressure on one of my wheels, they quickly briefed me on what services they offer, and as well as what they can do, and I’d say a few mins later they call me up to the front, and they briefly tell me that I have a flat tire, and that my brakes are low, so i say ok, can you give me a a quote to refer to it later, and then that pretty much wraps it up and they soon brings my car out, and well before I leave, I follow up with them about the flat tire I had, they further explain that it was  a complementary repair....I wasn’t expecting them to get on it right  away you know , but I guess for being my first time here, well I guess it was their way of saying “we hope you come again”. So I’m impress with my first experience there, i don’t know if anyone else had a simlair experience like that...but I might come around if I have any tire and problems again, who knows...also I will leave them a 3 out of five because I didn’t buy any of their services, but if one day I do decide to, I may change it...LOL<//Text>< Rating>

I will be purchasing my next set of tires from Les schwab Tires because of this experience.  These guys are great!  I took my daughters car in because she ran over a huge nail...not only did they fixed the tire in under 10 minutes, but they did it for free!  Super helpful, super professional service advisors made this a great customer experience for me.  Highly recommend!< /review>

<Text>Went in for a routine tire rotation and balance which was done as I waited. All was fine but as usual they tried to sell me something. This time they were pushing a machine that cuts extra groves in your tires for added traction in rain(like that's needed) and also make your tires run cooler thus adding life to the tire! I have to call BullS#*t on this gimic. They just sold me these tires 7000 miles ago ,why do they sell tires that need extra work on them to make them better! And all for the low low price of $51.00!  Makes you wonder!</Text><user_id>108271230684094822027</user_id><Name>Stan Reed</Name>< response>

Manufacturers do build their tires with factory siping, and it is for added traction and reduced heat build up.  The siping service we offer just adds a little more than what is done when they are manufactured.  As always, it's just an option, and the choice is yours to make.  Thank you.  - Nate"}< /response>

Went in cause front brakes were worn out. One was metal to metal (my fault)... I was told i needed new everything and my calipers replaced. Coming out to $577 and i would have to wait 5 days for parts to come in... I passed went to Pacific Tire in Dinuba they fixed it same day. About 1.5 hr wait most of that was waiting for parts to be delivered.... LS's customer service is good though. They lie to you with a smile..</Text>

Had a flat on my 2500 chevy and took it in to the new Les Schwab and let me tell you the service was great! Every one was polite and very professional. Even the assistant manager John is a great person came up to me and introduced himself to me and my wife. I thought that was a special touch. I would refer them to any one for service. Glad to have them in Reedley.< /text>

Alignments: If a customer is asking solely for a 2 wheel alignment, quote, complete, and charge the customer for a 2 wheel alignment.

I really don't know how people get ripped off, and then give four stars or five stars because of the great time they had. I needed new tires, so decided to give them a shot. Reminded me of a used car lot. Fyi, the guy who meets you in the lot is just like a dealership salesman. While very friendly and helpful answering questions, he could not help himself from bringing things up like: "if we replace all four tires today" or "if I could go outside and check out the truck, we could get the process of replacing those four tires started right now while you shop". Even though I told him in the lot that I was there for the first time, and wanted to go inside first to see what brands and services they offer. He asked, "Are you looking to buy today?", to which I answered "Most definitely, I have to because I had a sidewall fail. As long as you guys treat me right, I'll be buying them here." He then took a while showing me the tires, was very helpful and informative, but could not turn off the sales approach. I get quotes: Cooper High Country A/T LT265/75R16, installed for approximately $1,116. Toyo Open Country A/T, for approximately $1,201 @ list price of $259 each. I have $2,000 burning a hole in my pocket. Decided that Toyo is a great brand, I could spend the extra $90 dollars for those. First though, I ask for a quote for Bridgestone Dueler A/T, same size. His manager has to call it in to get it. He asked if I was actually looking to buy tires, and was there a reason to why I would want these Bridgestones over theirs. If you're a tire guy you would understand why. I tell him that I've owned them several times, and was impressed. He asks the salesman a few things, and finally makes the decision to call in the quote. I'm thinking give me the quote so I can make a decision here, and it seems like he is complaining about giving a quote. He gets a quote, for H/T. Not A/T, because he says they are unavailable. So he has the quote, sits down, goes to find my file, asked for my phone number assuming that his salesman had already collected my personal info in order to provide me the first quotes (you would understand if you ever worked for a bank or used/new car dealership, not to). I tell him I didn't feel comfortable giving his company my phone number yet. He asks, "He just gave you those quotes without getting your personal information (or whatever jargon)?" slightly incredulously. He grimaces and tells me "Well we just went through all this work to get that quote, and I would like to be able to save it for you." and just stares at me. I look down at his nametag real quick, say his name. He asks "yes?". I ask "So you need my number to save my quote?". He says, "Yes.". I say just to give it to me. He says, "Ok.", goes to the computer and clicks few things. Asks, "May I have your name?" I tell him "Sure, it's Michael." Out of courtesy. He sits there for a moment, doing nothing. Then, "May I have your last name". I look at his screen, he has my first name typed in one of the fields on his screen. I just chuckle, shake my head at him, and give him a fake last name. He types the name in and finally hands me my quote after printing it, with a smile on his face. $1000.  It was all just too sales oriented, so I go out to my truck to check some things. I look up the Bridgestone A/T, $154 retail price each, well that's only 620. Say $100 for install, that makes $720, round up to $750. I look up the Toyo A/T, $137 to $181. Well that doesn't make sense, what's the extra $450 for?! Fed up and not happy, I go to a store that starts with W, with a tire center. $154 each tire, for the exact Bridgestone A/T 10 ply 118mph tires I wanted, $81 to mount them all, including $10 a tire for the national service plan that Les offers. I even gave personal info for that. Also, there are more Ws around then Les. I found out later that my mom had bought tires at Les. One had exploded very soon after her purchase, tearing apart her fender and bumber. They used zip-ties to fix it. Do people 4 & 5 star getting screwed, while being treated this way?< /review>

They put my spare on for me when I went in with a leak that couldn't be patched and didn't charge me, this location is clean and has a coloring station that my 2 year old enjoyed and complementary popcorn and coffee, the staff is very friendly and I would definitely recommend this place.</Text>

Well they lied to me by telling me I need new bolts or else my tires will fall off, and they charge me for tire rotation. Which is free. Im going to make a complain. Also they didn’t give my original bolts back.<//review>

<Review>Wow their customer service is awesome my favorite sandwich so far is the Turkey bacon avocado croissant. They didn’t have anymore later in the day and the girl helped me pick the squaw bread one which was amazing as well. I will continue to come back here this is a hidden gem right here thanks guys.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Text>A Stone in Orange! Little Deli place having a fantastic taste!  The generous part of sandwich for the more compact size!  No wonder folks prefer to get theirs ... No suggestion jar nothing in the invoice.  What you receive as a regular client is free salad or biscuits.  Yum.</Text>< UserId.>

< Review>
A gem in Orange! Small Deli place with a great taste! Generous portion of sandwich even for the smaller size! No wonder people like to get theirs here... No tip jar no nothing in the bill. What you get as a frequent customer is free cookies or salad. Yum..and they even give away free chips from time to time! My favorite is corned beef sandwich on squaw.  Hubby loves pastrami on rye. We share a green salad.  Go get yours!<//Review>

<Text>Great food. Been here 3 times already in just under a week, couldn't help myself. Unfortunately the last time I went I order a fish burger, plus a San Francisco burger and BBQ beef hot sandwich, but instead of a fish burger I got a Frisco something idk what it was and I didn't know until hours later when I gave the intended eater the food. And yes ik I could've checked but I was in a hurry to catch a bus and that's the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars as it was only mildly busy and a man a few orders ahead of me also was having some difficulty with his order, fortunately it was just late getting to him.</Text>< userid>

My new favorite lunch place. I've had the Cobb and the BAM salads. Both delicious. And their tamarind kombucha is replacing my afternoon coffee break.< /Review>

Excellent service and food! I ordered sandwiches and salads for my grand-daughter's birthday party. The party was on a Sunday, so I had to pick-up the food Saturday afternoon because the deli is not open on Sunday. I was a bit worried the salads and some of the sandwiches may be a little soggy due to the 1 day refrigeration, but to my delight, everything was extremely fresh and delicious!  Amazing friendly staff and great prices! Orange Tree Deli is definitely on the list for my next event.<//review>

<Review>Orange Tree Deli is our family's go-to restaurant. They have daily specials, fantastic breakfast burritos, amazing sandwiches, delicious Mexican food, incredible salads and so much more. On Thursdays they have a turkey plate that is basically your grandma's Thanksgiving dinner, and the best BBQ you've ever had on Saturdays. If I could give OTD 10 stars, I would!!<//Review>< Date>

A cheap place for a large sandwich. I normally take the turkey sandwich, which has creamy mayo, loaded with turkey, lettuce spread across the outside of the turkey, and tiny chunks of tomato but not too small.<//text>

<text>The sandwiches are alright, too bad the service is horrific!!! Do not order a sandwich to pick up, you'll end up waiting 15 minutes just to get to the counter to pick it up and pay for it. The owner(s) are obviously out of touch with providing good service. Here's a tip, have a second line just for call in orders.<//text>< pictures>

Consistently great service with market rate prices. Can be backed up at times, but you will be satisfied with service. I break phones REGULARLY and never been hustled to upgrade or told what wasn’t possible.</Text>

These guys have saved my bacon twice this month first repairing my iPhone X and more recently today my 5th generation iPad. Not only do they have great customer service but their technicians are fast too. If I ever have a need to get repairs again this business will have my business<//text>

Very friendly also can multitask and get the job done in a very professional way. Was polite to all of her customers that came in asking questions.  Very honest about what she could do with your product.  I will tell others about the place of business</Review>

But if I do, I know where to go.
Thanks

UPDATE: yes, I broke my screen For the third time

I called first, Dominick answered the phone and were very professional. He answered all my questions, upon my arrival he took the phone, and my information. I tired to pay for it, and he insisted that he fix the phone first to make sure everything works properly.

First off, I didn't think it could be fixed at all, but I was wrong. The phone was fixed in less then 30mins.

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! BEWARE!

Day 1: bought my Apple Watch in to get a battery replacement. The lady (heavyset black woman) at the counter was extremely rude and seemed tired. She told me apple watches are a lot of work & she’s tired & not trying to take it apart if “she don’t have too”.  She then tried to quote me $20 extra then what her assistant quoted me when I called before I came in. I advised her that Infact it was the battery and to please change it , she stated it would take about 40 minutes so I left that watch with her. I came back about two hours later and it still wasn’t repaired, she said she was too tired to fix it and would do it first thing tomorrow so I left it with her over night.

Day 2: Came back the next day to pick it up, the guy at the front desk told me the battery was changed and I was good to go. Got home and realized the battery was still dead & they never changed it after they took my $85.

Day 3: Came back in to get the battery replaced forreal this time. The lady at the front desk still looked tired and was extremely rude just like before. As soon as she seen me she stated “we just gon give you yo money back”.

So after 4 trips & 3 days and wasted gas and time they refused to fix my watch or even call me to update me, simply because the heavyset lady is LAZY. Who ever owns this business needs to fire that lady & if she does it needs to be shut down. Will be contacting BBB next!</Review>

I would like to start off with unprofessional, 2 days with my Apple Watch no repairs made at all , lady inside had no knowledge of how to repair asking where I bought my watch from?!?!? Ummm did that even matter the point was to replace with my battery that I brought in myself and still nothing this is a scam place that will just take your money real pieces of s.h.i.t. Sorry not sorry I Warned you!!!!!<//review>

<Text>If they would have provided the service offered the price would have been great. They never follow up with any phone calls after they promise the work should be done. I believe for simple fixes this is a good place. Screen repairs and things of that nature but anything to technical I found both of my devices returned to me still broken and one worse off then when I gave it to them. I believe in some ways they went above and beyond to try and fix my devices however because of poor communication and lack of knowledge or maybe equipment they fell short of my needs. Honestly I will still bring my devices there to be fixed but I won’t be counting on having them back any time soon and only for minor things. For example I have a virus of some kind on my laptop and I think this would be something they could handle.</Text>< Pics>

This business simply works, simply and effectively! I called to verify they were open under COVID restrictions and if they had the correct battery in stock. They repair and fix glass screens too, with a good stock of quality accessories for phones, pads etc.

The two employees, Noah and Dominic were professional and efficient. The job was completed on time after leaving it there for a couple of hours, as promised.

The store was busy - and safely following all COVID  protocols.</review>

Knowledgeable, caring and considerate. I was informed of the cost of repair and estimated time of completion. All estimates were accurate and repair was better than I expected. All for a great price.< /Text>

Within an hour, i had my phone back with a new screen and opted for the screen protector.
All said and done, i was out the door with the added screen protector for a bit less then a competitors quote for just the screen.
I’ll definitely recommend this place!</Review>< Pictures>

I have become pretty close to the staff there.... reason being..... (clearing my throat) I seem to break my screen on my iPhone so often, Repair All just automatically gives me these great discounts.... it’s kinda bad that I’m bad with my devices 🤔🤔... but this most recent time, I got to know Isaac and a newer manager (to that store) they were both kind and very pleasant to talk to and get to know.... we laughed a lot because of how many times I’ve broken my screen in just a years time.... They ALWAYS  take care of me in a matter of minutes.... and they were gracious enough to let me use the land line to contact my daughter to let her know I was ok and I’d pick her up as soon as I was done.... (after they cleaned the phone) ... with so much division in the world right now... we need more people like these two.... to lighten the mood just a tad... lower the temperature some and see each other as what we are.... HUMANS.... I would absolutely continue doing business with Repair All... and most certainly will refer ANY AND ALL THAT MAY NEED THEIR SERVICES!!!! Thank you guys again!!!!

<Text>It was a bit out of my way but considering most stores were closed or unable to accommodate my same day service needs, it was worth the drive!

Very timely and I appreciated them calling to communicate my service was complete and ready for pick-up

Very professional and friendly Staff.

Albert (really both guys) were super friendly, funny and very efficient. I came in stressed about my phone being cracked and Albert put me at ease in seconds.
He assured me he would fix my phone in no time and did just that while keeping me laughing the whole time I was there as a bonus! I would definitely recommend RepairALL to anyone that has phone troubles and Albert is the man that will take care of you. Thanks again guys!< /review>

I came in today to replace my cracked screen protector. Dominick greeted us as soon as we opened the door. He was knowledgeable with their products, was able to replace my screen protector while answering a call (he was by himself), and went out of his way to clean my phone. THANK YOU!<//Review>

<Review>I just stopped by thinking I may have to make an appointment to get my iPhone 6s screen fixed but they were able to fix it right away in 30 minutes. I was able to drop off my phone, get gas at Costco and make a Target run and then go back to get my phone. Very friendly and reasonably priced. I would definitely come back if I crack another screen.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>Today was my first time ever walking into this repair shop and hands down, best repair shop ever. I'm not saying this to just give the shop a good fake review. I'm just mindblown of how fast my screen for my iPhone 7 plus got fixed! The tech that worked on my phone, his name is Dominic, or Dom. He's very friendly and he was so passionate about his job. I have a new repair shop to come by if I ever need to have my phone fixed. 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🙏🏼</review>< Name>

<Text>Over priced  - Don't  take a galaxy  s8 there they'll quote you 200 , charge you 230   . When you can buy a  refurbished s8  for 200

that said they did it quick . So  unless you need  your phone repaired , right away   it's a  big rip off</Text>< gmapID>

Alberto was very professional and kind.  I told him I thought my iphone 6 s was not charging because of the port, but he suggested  checking the battery as well.  He ask for my number so he could let me no if it was both.  He was done in less than the hour he quoted. He also let me in before 10 am when he saw me standing out side he was a gentlemen he open the unlock door for me.  I could praise him all day for an outstanding service. He even gave me a small discount on the iphone accessories.  This has been the best experience I have had with a phone tech in a long time.  I told everyone at work and I gave out his number and address.  I will be back. Thank you so much.< /Review>

<text>Dominic, he prefers to be called Dom, was very professional and very efficient. He greeted everyone who came into the store very warmly. He told me the repair would take about 40 minutes. I came back and watched him put the finishing touches on the repair.

He gave the customers who came in after me an approximate time their work would be completed.

I was very impressed by this young man and how he handled the customers that I observed.< /text><Name>Ed Brounstein< /Name>< resp>

<text>I went here after Comcast could not help, even though they tried to fix the problem I had on my LG phone! So I asked if they knew of a phone repair shop near us and they found Repair All Phone Repair! This place was just great really if I could give them more than 5 star's I would, their service and hospitality was so out standing!! My phone problem was fixed so fast by Dominic, and he really showed a lot of passion for his job, and he showed great customer service!!! I'll always come back here this is a great place if you need your phone or tablet fixed!
Thanks again Dominic, you're company is really blessed to have someone as talented as you!!< /text>< pictures>

Great place to go of you need your phone fixed in a jiffy...versus sending it out waiting 2 weeks for the same price. Thanks again Noah!!!</Review>

< Review>
For the most part the people working there are nice and I feel bad saying any of this but I feel like they messed up my phone battery when fixing my iPhone. My phone will start restarting and shutting off abruptly every.time. It gets to 30%. It gets in a cycle of turning off (or “dying”), I’ll turn it back on and it will go from 29% to 9% once it’s turnt back on. God forbid it gets to the 9-10% mark cuz then it will loss a percent by the second and I promise I’m not over exaggerating. It will obviously die again after 1%, but this is when it gets weird. I’ll try to turn it back on (was 30% 5mins before dying no way it’s already dead, low battery on, low light, all apps closed, not in use) And it will be back to 25% and it will die again, go back down to 9%, then it will be at 20%, so on, until it does finally legitimately die, like dead dead.< /Review>

<Text>I have full confidence in the capabilities of the staff at this quirky operation. If you want your phone fixed quickly and properly at a very reasonable cost go here. If you want to pay more and need some hand holding or maybe some hugs go to one of the big expensive places.</Text><userid>111049694385974161515<//userid>< Pictures>

< Review>
I thought my phone was dead.  Barry took a look at it and said he could get it to work again.  Since I have best buy insurance I checked with them too.  Best buy $149 and a used replacement with none of my stuff on it.  Barry said $200 that would include a new screen and some body work.  Plus I get to keep all the stuff on my phone.  He had it ready by 5:30 the same day.  I am thrilled with their service.</Review>

The service was good and the price was reasonable; your staff is knowledgeable and helpful. But I went by four times and either the store was temporarily closed (gone to lunch, gone to the bank, just gone) or there were too many devices already in queue. You either need to hire more people OR allow people to queue up online. I live in South Vallejo; it's a hardship to drive across town, wait 20 minutes in the car for someone to finish lunch and then be told, well, there are 5 phones ahead of you. You could manage this better without changing your service menu.</Review>

<review>The day started with me dropping my laptop and the screen broke. I was working on a important document at the time. Long story short  I went Repair All and there customer service and mannerisms were top notch.  I actually left the store with my much needed document, smiling and laughing.< /review>< Pics>

Went on a Friday to get my Mac book repaired, it has now been 2 weeks since and no call back. When I did call I was told they would call me back shortly and they never did, so I called them again only to be told I have to wait 3 more days because the computer screen hadn’t arrived. I chose this place because of good reviews and walking in knowing my computer was in good hands and would be back with me in no time so I could finish my school. I just believe they shouldn’t give  a time and day if they aren’t even sure when it will be ready that was very unprofessional.< /text>

First time here to get my tablet screen fixed. When I came in I was helped right away by Brooke. She said it would take a few days or so to get the part in and explained all that would be done when the part came in. Got a call a few days later saying the wrong part was sent and it would take some time. No big deal for me. I liked that they notified me right away. About a week after that I got the call that it was ready. Brooke helped me at checkout. Overall, it took a bit of time because of the wrong part but my experience with them was great. Brooke was very helpful and friendly and seemed to know what she was doing. The price was fair. I will definitely be going back.<//Text>

This business (RepairAll) namely BROOK, had a chance to take advantage of me by charging for work I did not require but thought I had.  She honestly could of charged me over a hundred dollars and then some but yet choose to be honest and tell me and my wife the truth saving us money.
Thank you for being truthful.<//review>

<Text>These guys are amazing. I was looking to get a new phone, but heard about them from the Verizon store. They told me other customers were happy with RepairAll. I gave them a try and did not regret it. I even decided to stay and watch them work on it, and enjoyed their pleasant personalities. If you need your phone fixed, take it to them, I am glad I did. I am even thinking of going on Yelp and giving them a good review.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>There was some confusion on the part of the intake person (no longer there) about whether or not to collect a deposit which resulted in order cancelled and ensuing delay to obtain parts. I have to go out of my way to get there when they're there. In the end the employee on duty realizing the inconveniences to me, promised that my iPad would be ready by first thing in the morning and it was and I'm pleased. My device was seriously damaged, deliberately by a vindictive individual and I had no faith that it was repairable.
I was and I am still pleasantly surprised. I felt compelled to leave a liberal gratuity.
Realizing that stuff happens, it's nice to know where to go for this type of problem.
The next best thing to a replacement warranty!

That was my previous experience with repairall, this time is pretty much the same. You have an outstanding crew that do outstanding work, with an outstanding attitude and all at a reasonable price. Keep it up!!< /text>< pics>

<Review>My phone was so damaged I didn’t think it could be repaired. When I came into the repair store the representative was very professional and was up front about repair cost  and how long it would take them to repair. The gave me their card and informed me to call if I had any questions. I felt so safe with them and felt great  when I left the store. I later on pick my phone up a it looks like a brand new phone!!! The price was great for the amount of work I had done to my phone. I definitely recommend going here.<//Review><gmapID>0x8085732a49f07abb:0xcf8369b4aa88c1e2< /gmapID><Pics>None</Pics>< name>

Got my screen fixed on Sunday & left thinking things were good. When I got home my screen started turning red, then yellow & green, then completely black when I shut it off & turned it back on. Went back in on Monday & had to wait 3 hrs in the store just to get my original cracked screen back. Should of just went to Apple from the start, but I also shouldn’t of had to wait 3 hours just to find out your screens aren’t compatible with my iPhone X (after paying for a repair) & then getting my old cracked screen back. Anyone reading this should definitely just go straight to Apple to avoid this process.<//Review>

They are called RepairALL. they say they will repair any phone, however, today is the second time they say they cant service a device of mine. If you own an iphone or galaxy phone, you'll be ok, otherwise, you should probably look elsewhere for service. Probably would recommend a name change.</review>

Couldn’t be any happier. Saved me hundreds of dollars if I would’ve upgraded my phone. Thanks to Carlos at AT&T for recommending Repair ALL! I highly recommend this place for all your phone repairs. They fix anything,  PC’s, tablets, iPhones, etc. A+++++<//Review>< Pics>

Manger was great service was great! They desperately need to get some help doing the paperwork getting checked in & out then she can use her skills to fix phones while anyone can do the paperwork.. people will be more satisfied it will be more efficient & company will make way more money.. spent an hour in store while she was checking in more phones took her 15 min to do repair while she was helping other customers.. if there was one more person there she could of fixed at least 4-5 phones in that hour not just one.. company loosing a bunch of money on the table.. but very happy with her knowledge & service with what she had to work with.. nothing!< /review>

I was very very disappointed with RepairAll. I came in to get my camera repaired on the phone. They ordered the part and I left a $45 deposit. It would come in and one week and the repair should take 1 hour. They will call me when the part came in. In 20 days I called three times simply because they never called me the previous time I called the part haven't come in. Finally I got a chance to bring my phone in and get my camera repaired. When I dropped it off I was informed it would take three hours cuz they're a little behind. I came back in 3 hours and they haven't even started to repair my phone they need another hour. I told him I'll be back in the morning. When I got there the next day I said is my phone fixed they replied yes. He turned on the phone he goes what!!! The camera didn't work. After a few minutes he got it to work. He said the bill was $85 which I paid. When I got home the camera did not work. I went back to get it fixed. After another hour he says I can't get this phone to work I told will I get my money back cuz nothing was done he says he has no control if it has to be done by corporate. When I check my bill they charged me for the part twice, so they overcharged me did not fix my phone, and I am out $125 with a camera that doesn't work and no refund. I will never go to this place again.<//Review>

The workers were very nice and were quick to help me out. I did have an issue with my home button after a screen replacement and they immediately tried to figure out the problem, including replacing the new screen they just installed. In the end she showed me how to use the Floating Home button for just in case I had any further issues with it.</Text>

Very unsatisfied. They received a screen that was defective for my phone. At that time they assured me another screen would be there within 3 to 5 days. It took over 2 weeks to get in another screen. All that was offered was a sorry. I had to call them every couple of days to ask about my phone. They really dropped the ball for me and I will never go there again or refer any of my friends or family to them.<//Review>

<review>This place was an absolute dream! I have the worst luck, I’m always breaking my phone screen because I never have a case on my phone. However Miguel Macías helped me out so much! He fixed my screen so fast, recommend a fabulous case with a rocking screen protector! Ive dropped my phone many times now and it hasn’t broken. The best thing yet is the environment its full of positive energy. I highly recommend this store especially getting your work done by Miguel Macías, trust me you won’t regret it.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>i love this place! Miguel left my iphone 7 looking brand new like it never had a scratch on it! and on the plus side it was such an affordable price. I highly recommend getting your phone or any device fixed here! they treat you really nice and give you super cheap prices on anything! they also repair your phone in less then 25 mins which is super convenient even though you will not want to leave because they have a lougne set up with netflix and they have complementary coffee or tea and chips! so you will feel right at home while getting your phone fix! thank you Miguel for such a great experience!< /Text><Name>Ana Paola Chavez< /Name>< Pictures>
