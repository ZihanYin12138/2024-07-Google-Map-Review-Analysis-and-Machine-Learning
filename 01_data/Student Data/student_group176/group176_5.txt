<review>Despite its looks and location, it's got one of the cleanest and nicest smelling restrooms! Beautiful faucet with evenly flowing water. And I'm only talking up their restroom so much because their food is actually just ok.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpCERNX3IdAJ-fOSeLke65Pl8sx7h55jPLxTJc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><name>Quan Dang<//name><Date>1501814699268<//Date>< rate>

<text>I got the zetton soy ramen which was nothing special besides being the restaurants moniker. The broth was a little to strong and just didn't blend together well. The chashu was good and they give you a decent amount especially if you order extra. The noodles were chewy but the ramen as a whole wasn't perfect but good for a ramen fix</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnYbRu5HpNfQC7SOBcNJIK1cSd5BJG50TZHCsU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNyyGrVbIv8X2yaZ7nUBKMSGl4WEdylv5ZbPLs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

I lived in japan for about 2 years as a United States Marine. I missed the culture and the food, and honestly every time I enter in I'm always greeted with a smile by the staff and always given a welcome in Japanese. I know a tiny bit of Japanese and I try my best to respond in Japanese. (I hope the staff don't think I'm being rude :P). But anyway the food taste exactly as If I was back in japan. That's why they will always have me comeback again and again. Rated 5 stars.< /Text>

<Review>The noodle wasn't cooked completely, had some crunchy taste. The inner part of the pork on the soup was cold. The soup itself tasted awful, it was smelly. The restaurant was full with some gas smell.  I really don't recommend this ramen place.<//Review>< rating>

First time visit.  Great customer service and big portions, with good prices.  Ramen noodles was smooth and good flavor.  However, the soup was bland and the habanero dipping sauce wasn't even hot. Chili oil tasted stale.  The meat wasn't fresh.  It tasted like it was prepared several days earlier and then warmed up with the microwave.  BTW: I don't think this is a Japanese Ramen restaurant because the wait and cooking staff were Latinos and they were speaking Spanish.< /Text>

<Text>It was finally open after coming several times at the wrong time, don’t know if it’s new owner or what but it wasn’t as good as before and now you get sat down with menu, get up to order and pay, get up again to get your ramen and  get up again for forks, hot sauce, water, to go container. Definitely not coming back...</Text><username>Hi-D Spnz</username><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

I live by the college, and make sure that every Thursday night after class, I stop in and grab myself a bowl of ramen with my friend. I've haven't skipped a week in two months and have no plans to stop any time soon. Great service, great food, great prices.< /review>

My wife ate pork salt ramen and I ate bibimbap early this afternoon.

Both order taste good and the servings are geneous. Price is reasonable.
We share food as we always do.

We plan to be back pretty soon.<//Review>

That have a good ramen.

If if you are around the neighborhood and crave for ramen, this place is a good option. Although I believe their original location in costa mesa tastes better, this place serves a decent bowel of ramen.

Tips: if you go during lunch hours 11:3 to 3 pm, you can enjoy a small bowel from a few choices for 2 dollars.<//review>

First time here and I will be back. Several Veggie options. I had the vegetarian kimchi ramen. It had a lot of veggies. The only thing that they can improve is that the tofu and mushrooms were a little sweet.</review>

This restaurant was highly recommended by a friend who lives here locally so we had to try it! There are a few different options and they all sounded great. We ordered 2 different types of ramen bowls and a wide order of the chicken fried rice. All of it was absolutely delicious!! Best fried rice I've had in years. The green tea wss also awesome, we ordered one hot and one cold and both were refreshing. Staff was very friendly and accommodating . Service was quite fast as well. If you like pho or ramen this place is a MUST TRY!!<//text>

It was just okay. There are defiantly better ramen places near by. I personally didn't care for the broth and as much jabanero miso as I added, I never got it to be any spicier.< /Review>

Fantastic!! I just had the miso ramen. I substituted the pork broth and it was amazing! If I lived in LA, I'd be back at least once a week. Glad I gave it a shot.

The menu has an extensive list of ramen varieties, including Korean themed bowls and vegetarian broths. They also have donburi and Japanese curry options.<//Text>

Zetton on it!  Zetton on it!

Ramen Zetton, the popular Costa Mesa ramen shop, has a new branch nearby me in Cypress.  For their soft opening, Ramen Zetton has priced their ramen bowls from $5 - $7.  Being a ramen lover & not one to pass up a discount, I hurried down to Ramen Zetton, eagerly awaiting slurping up some piping hot ramen.

The traditional ramen condiments are well represented - chili oil, white pepper grinder, vinegar, red chili pepper & house made spicy miso chili paste.

The house made spicy miso chili paste has a definite kick to it.  Not for spice weaklings.

I went for their signature Sesame Miso Tantan ramen ($7, reg. price $8.50)-

The tantan ramen broth is thick, almost curry-like.  Adding the entire jar of spicy miso chili paste, the broth became almost akin to marinara.  Plus, a splash of vinegar, some chili pepper, a drizzling of chili oil, freshly ground white pepper & a splash or 2 of vinegar. The vinegar is what really kicked the flavor profile up a notch.   Hearty & rich, the sesame miso tantan consisted of a special blend of sesame & miso, chicken broth, green onion, ground pork & vegetable puree.  The ramen had a good bite to it.  My preference would've enjoyed them more al dente, but I was not disappointed with the wonderfully thick broth & juicy chunks of ground pork.  At $7, a delicious bowl that's a must get!

Not feeling soup today?  Ramen Zetton's simplistic menu also has various rice dishes & gyoza for your consideration.

Service was good.  I arrived a few minutes before opening.  The father of the owner of Ramen Zetton was running the place.  The cook called in sick & one from the Costa Mesa location was brought in to save the day.  My water was refilled on a couple occasions & I was even given containers of the spicy miso chili paste to take home, w/o asking.  Not a place for large groups, seating is minimal with a few tables, booths & bar seating.

Parking is in private lot.  Hard to spot from the street, Ramen Zetton is located behind Oodles of Noodles Pho Restaurant & adjacent to Poki Roll.

Hurry & get down to Zetton!  Ramen Zetton serves up soothing bowls of ramen that are priced cheaper than their competitors.  The sesame miso tantan ramen was a winner & I'm eagerly anticipating trying their other ramen offerings.  I can't procrastinate, though, as I want to take advantage of Ramen Zetton's soft opening pricing.  Hungry for soup? Check out Ramen Zetton!

Highly recommend!

Former place for Cambinos and Teriyaki Monkey Wave rises Ramen Zetton. If you've been to this location, you would know how small this kitchen and seating is. I would say it seats about 24-30 people max.  Lots of parking in the lot, near by Icon (For you craft beer people)

As for the Ramen, prices are still discounted for Classic ($5), Old School ($5), Special Salt ($6), Special Soy ($6). Of course, we tried one of each.  The noodles for the $5 are thinner (Chuka-Soba), while the Ramen for the $6 are thicker. The broth for the Classic tasted packaged, the Old school Shoyu had a light soy (my favorite) and the Specials had this Vegetable broth which was a bit too much I thought.

Non of the broth tasted in depth, unlike those day long tonkotsu broths but for what you get, it's okay. The chicken that does come with the noodle tasted like shoyu braised with sugar and that was just okay too. Kitakata is nearby, personally I would go there instead.

Service here with one person is pretty awesome I have to say, even with a packed house.
Yep check in gets you free soda currently.  I will have to make another trip to try the other noodles.</text>

Husband and I both are originally from Cali, and so our friends and family could all be with us on wedding day we loaded up the toyhauler and came to cali. They offer all inclusive packages which made it very easy for us being states away. They made us feel like family, our wedding was above and beyond what we imagined. We will forever keep this day in our dreams. We come from a ranch town and have horses of our own so Sweet Pea Ranch was just for us, we felt at home.
We would like to celebrate an anniversary here down the road (if they allow that)</Review>< pics>

<Review>Working with Sweet Pea Ranch for our October 12th wedding was an absolute dream. I was incredibly nervous going into the wedding planning process. The idea of having to coordinate everything was just overwhelming and I was sure where to begin. I stumbled upon Sweet Pea on The Knot's planning app and instantly fell in love with the photos of the venue. Then learning that it was all inclusive, I knew that that was the way for us to go. We had a long engagment but knowing that everything was set and waiting for us to be ready for our big day, was such a stress relief. The fact that all we /had/ to do was get ourselves dressed, get someone to take photos, and someone to marry us (which now is a package option at Sweet Pea as well!) made the few decisions we did have to make so much easier! Our day was beautiful and went off without a hitch, though it did seem that the DJ didn't play many of our requested songs which was a bit of a bummer (but the music he did play was fun!) but I'm so grateful that I found Sweet Pea Ranch! We could never have planned the beautiful day that they gave us!<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxCmN_gFoBN7cVVgprjoQeKEnMIYdmvMTX1QB5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4horivlToE7Dm2vvVrpQRGvseU5so9W9l8RV7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6JyQOHwqMqIF1aIDFOZ9--oF6IjOsgv2DdsQG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOy7Ue-Pu28ex7GSnp3ATZuSLcvhEqOocNF2Bl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrZ2T9COaKhSrJ8J1DszXfp7S1v4t0wdIlk-6Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCof0j3vrDUZWqXs67av2nn-HCd7IEXbCDZ-xN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
My daughter and new son-in-law were just married at sweet pea ranch. Their wedding was the fairytale wedding my daughter has always dreamed of. From the first time we went to the ranch an met Tess, Jen and Chelsea my daughter knew it was a perfect place for their wedding. I just can’t say enough about Tess, Jen and the entire staff. Jen was our coordinator and she did not miss one detail. Jen and Tess went above and beyond to accommodate a few extra requests we have made.   Not only is the ranch an amazing place for a wedding, the animals added the perfect extra touch. I will recommend this venue to everyone.      I am one happy mama.< /Review>

<Text>Just recently went to a wedding here and it was okay. The ceremony spot was small and cute. The layout of the venue is a bit odd and I didn't care for the uneven terrain every few steps. I saw a few people trip which didn't seem very safe. The reception area was very rustic and well themed but they only had port-a-potty's which was such a turn off for a wedding. So gross to use in our wedding attire. I wouldn't come here again or book them based on that alone. One of the staff members said this place has been here for several years so you would think they would make indoor bathrooms a priority but I guess not. Food was okay but no vegetarian entree option and nothing was super tasty. Near the end of the night, the bartender cut off my friend who was drinking and she was not even drunk. She was so embarrassed because of that and they went to so far to tell the Bride that she was cutoff. I would have been livid had I been the Bride. You don't interrupt my night to tattle on a friend. She hadn't been aggressive nor rude to anyone when they cut her off and yet they still seemed to make a scene about it. It really turned me off to this venue. I felt really bad for my friend since she had actually gone up a couple times for me and the Groom's mother for drinks as a good gesture. Overall, this venue left a sour taste in my mouth for recommending them to anyone.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>
{'time': 1584488758378, 'text': "Hi Mandy, we are sorry your experience was not what you expected. I'm not sure which of our Bride and Grooms wedding you attended however, I can tell you how much effort they put into making their selections for their guest to enjoy. Deep Pit Bbq with brisket, bbq chicken, scalloped potatoes, mac and cheese, grilled vegetables and  two type of friendly vegan and vegetarian salads, A four hour hosted bar service (free to the guest) fully loaded dessert bar, coffee bar, beverage bar, smores and popcorn by the fire pits are just a few of the amenities. Please don't forget the Dancing and music by their chosen DJ! He is the best! I know that our couple would have wanted you to have the best time ever! They carefully chose each guest in order to keep them in their budget. On average, couples pay over $100.00/per person for each guest they invite. The portajohns you mentioned are actually solar powered airplane type restroom with flushing toilets and sinks to wash hands. We have recently purchased a beautiful 8 station restroom trailer with hard wood floors, stereo and a fireplace. I'm sure the bride and groom are sad that you did not have a good time and that you were were disappointed with their Venue selection. As for the Bar cutting off people who have over consumed, we have a responsibility and obligation to abide by liquor catering guidelines. Our brides and grooms are in full support of that prior to the event. They want their guest to be safe. Please know that we wish the best for you. Tess Mercer"}</resp>

We recently had our wedding here and it was absolutely amazing. The staff from beginning to end was so accommodating and really went above and beyond. I have to give a special shout out to Chelsea. She was our point person through out the whole process and she really was such a delight to work with. We enjoyed her services so much that we even had her as our photographer. This place is magical and beautiful.  All of our guests couldn’t stop talking about this unique venue. The ranch is so interactive and that’s the kind of wedding we wanted. Thank you to Tess the owner and her staff. You made our wedding so memorable. We will be back to celebrate our 10 year :)</Review>

Absolutely gorgeous venue. Country chic. Attended and April wedding here. Perfectly situated, felt like it was far away from everything but was an easy drive and not too difficult to get to. A hidden gem tucked against the hills. Tons of beautiful photo spots. There was a concern for rain and tents were put up, they still looked beautiful.

All of the attendants and waiters were great.

One of the smoothest run weddings I've ever been to.< /text>

Good times!  I've been to 3 different events here and they have been great!  Love the location,  the views,  the property, and the staff. Also they are open to a lot of different uses there.  I saw a production company use the entire place as their base camp for a shoot up on the mountain. So cool.  Really fun,  and the pictures you take during the events come out really cool because they have props all over. I know their pricing is competitive and you would most likely need to plan pretty far in advance for popular days.</text>

I was nervous to board my Dog and felt bad for leaving her behind, however from the get go of booking my appointment they were very helpful and reassuring that my sweet dog would be taken care of. They went above and beyond and kindly communicated with me while I was away to reassure me that all was going well and that my baby was having a great time. They sent me a picture and video of her smiling and being taken care of. No one had ever done that before and it made such an impression on me. I highly recommend them!< /review>

<Text>The staff was very friendly. Because of the pandemic, I wasn't allowed inside, so I have no idea what the place looks like.  My dogs were overdue for grooming. I have two (brothers) Maltipoos.  Their cuts were just okay. I asked for poodle cut. There were places that was cut too close to the skin. Their faces weren't cut close enough & their feet were not shaved.
The price was right at $50 each & the groomer himself was very nice.</Text>< user_id>

<text>I took my beloved Female dog to their boarding camp for the first time and when I picked her up she looked very happy.  She was definitely tired for all the playing and she didn't have the bad smell from regular kennels.  I will continue to use their facility and I definitely recommend this place.  Five stars  😁.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>So far great experience. Well priced and don’t have to pay extra for daily exercise that should be included in their stay. Very clean facility. Can be a little difficult to find, I wish they had a more obvious, taller sign. It is easy to miss. Either way, we brought our dogs here for an extended weekend and picked them up happy and exhausted. Added bonus is that they offer military discount.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>We just boarded our Belgian Malinois with them for a week. She was happy, well fed and well groomed (we ordered the full groom when we pick her up) groomer prefers cash or check but since it wasn't told to me at the time Camp Schultz added it to the general bill with no problem. The whole staff was lovely and we will definitely board with them again. (They took care of our German Shepherd on several occasions before she passed away of cancer last march). We have always been happy and have always returned.</Text><GmapID>0x80d950233d9e091f:0xaa4f82af08c3f87d<//GmapID>< time>

< review>
It’s the first time we have ever left our Belgian Malinios, Harley. I was a little nervous, but after picking him up, I saw it all went great. He seemed very happy and excited. He had a bath before. So I will definitely use Camp Schultz again. Prices are great. Our Harley was happy and the staff is so nice. They went over everything with me before dropping him off. I know I can leave Harley here again.<//review>

We boarded our 4 dogs for 12 days. When we picked them up, they were happy, healthy and looked great. They have boarded before, elsewhere, and came home smelling badly. Camp Schultz is so clean, without the odors typically found in kennels. Our dogs came home smelling just as good as when they had been dropped off. We will be happy to take them there again because we are so confident they were well cared for.<//review>

<Text>My dog has severe separation anxiety and he is a jumper. Camp Schultz made me feel safe as their facility is designed for athletic dogs. My Whippet was happy as I picked him up at the end of the day!! I will definitely recommend this facility and will be bringing my baby back.<//Text>< time>

<Review>Best boarding kennel near chula vista - hands down! Been taking our pets here for over 5 years and they never disappoint. Doggies are well cared for and come home well rested and not anxious.</Review><username>Jannette Garcia< /username><Time>1561501390412<//Time></record></dataset><record>

This was the first time we used Camp Schultz and we boarded our dog for 5 days.  Personally, I recommended using Camp Schultz if only boarding your pet for a day or two.

Camp Schultz doesn’t offer any web cams in any area of their facility.  There is no way of seeing how your dog is doing either during play or rest.  The facility will remove your pet’s collar and tags upon check in which I thought was unusual.

I had asked one of their employees, Christian, if it would be alright to call in and just see how our dog was faring. His response was, “honestly I will be really busy but you can call if you want to.”  As a first time customer, this response did not leave me with a feeling of confidence or that they cared.

The following day I called in towards the end of the day and spoke with Alex.  Alex was wonderfully understanding and gave me an update on our dog.  Alex provided wonderful customer service and made me feel my dog was being well cared for.< /text>

Camp Schultz is the one place that we feel safe leaving our Rottweiler who is not good with other dogs.  He comes home clean, content, tired...but most importantly he comes home in one piece.  We love that the people who work at Camp Schultz are consistent and they know our pet by name.  I highly recommend them if you are looking for a great option close to Bonita.  They have saved us a lot of grief over the last few years.</Text>

Camp Schultz staff are friendly towards our pet and us. The facility is very clean and professionally run. Whenever our dog stays with them, she eats well and returns home happy, which are signs she’s been treated well. Our pet only stays with Camp Schultz.<//Review>

<Review>This was my first time using Camp Schultz and I am impressed. My  baby was  happy and energetic when I returned  to Camp Shultz to get him.
He was the same way I left him when I picked him up. So that makes his mama happy.
I did pay for the extra pampered pooch service because I knew that's what my Bentley would need. Some family members questioned... why would you hey them for an extra service and you don't even know if they're actually going to provide that one-on-one service for Bentley. I said yes I would know.I know my dog and I know what he needs and I know I will be able to tell the difference.
I am interested in their doggie daycare service except I have to be to work at 7 a.m. and they don't open until 7 I wish they would consider opening a little earlier so I could provide Bentley the care he needs while I'm at work.

Only used it twice. The second time I headed their with my little dog he started shaking knowing where I was taking him. Poor little guy reeked of urine when I picked him up. I had also requested bedding, and when I saw him in the enclosure, it was just cold HARD cement. The small interaction I had with the staff, they seemed money driven than pet oriented. I'd be careful with that establishment.< /Text>

<GmapID>0x80d950233d9e091f:0xaa4f82af08c3f87d</GmapID><Text>So Camp Schultz has a nasty case of flagging anything negative towards their business on Yelp. Anything under 3 stars, a business can "flag" and it will get removed.
I did not invest money in this business and due to how my client's dog was treated, I left a review because they kept removing the client's review as well. Before you take your dog to this establishment, know their reviews arent as honest as they are making them out to be.
They gave a dog a razor burn on her genitals and a painful hair cut. My first review was removed within a few days. The second one was removed almost immediately. I have screenshots of both reviews and yet they cant be found on their page due to flagging inappropriately.
I've tried calling the establishment and asking for answers, but I'm continuously hung up on. Not a good business for handling dogs.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

24/7 they're confined to a kennel with the exception of THREE 5 minute potty breaks; 7am, 10am and 4pm. If you pay for a "suite" kennel they get enough space to pace around but there are only about 20 of those available, the rest of the dogs go into a crate which forces them to lay down their ENTIRE stay. These kennels get stacked up to the ceiling when its busy because they do not have a maximum capacity.

They have extra services available such as play time, walks and extra treats with their meals. WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. They don't provide your dogs with any of that, they just take your money and sign off that it was done.

I've seen dogs get picked up or dragged by the ears, choked due to how tight the slip leads are being pulled, another employee quit due to witnessing a dog being PUNCHED in the face to break up an altercation.

I have pets and this is not a place i would want my pets to stay, not even for daycare. If you take your dogs to daycare here you're paying to have your dog locked in a kennel ALL DAY. Buy your own kennel and leave them in the comfort of their own home.< /text></record>

Our dog has previously hated boarding at other facilities so when we had a house flood and HAD to board him, on short notice , I was sick with worry!

Camp Schultz not only helped us out when no one else could, but our dog loved it! He was happy when I visited him and didn’t whine when they walked him back. Usually he pulls and cries for me when taken from me, so I know he was not stressed!

He did the extra play time to help with being in boarding for so long. He loves other dogs.

We would absolutely reboard him there. He is a newf mix so the outdoor kenneling does require a grooming after but we groom him regularly as it is, so itwas no burden. And he had an insanr amount of fur, so your pet might not need anything but a bath :)<//Review>

<Text>The best part of this place is the decor. The bathroom is very fancy and well-maintained. The food is fine. Not the worst but not the best Thai I've ever eaten. (e.g. the flavors were good but noodles weren't quite right)
Pro: they allow dogs in the outdoor seating area.< /Text>< Pics>

<rating>4</rating><review>My family loves it here! My parents, grandma, and I used to meet here for lunch at least two times a month, pre-COVID. It is a popular spot, and the food is phenomenal! I always get the Street Fair Noodle without bacon (allergy), and it is always delicious.

Honestly though, the biggest highlight here is the fact that my mom can order more than one dish, and it isn't a plain salad. She has some fairly severe food allergies, and this is one of a handful of restaurants in the entire county where she can eat. We are so excited and thankful that they are willing and able to make the modifications she needs, to be able to enjoy Thai food again!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

There's something for even the pickiest of eaters on their menu. I highly suggest the fried rice. I have been to dozens of Thai and Chinese restaurants around the United States, and none of them can even come close to comparing with this place.</review></record>

<Review>SEA Thai Bistro has excellent food, wine, and cocktails. The atmosphere is fun and interesting.  I typically sit at the beautiful bar counter for dinner. The other patrons at the bar are always friendly and everyone discusses their food. The service is great and I have never had any issue with my food or service. The only problem I ever have is that they extremely busy and if you are there without a reservation, it can take an hour to be seated.<//Review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

Mains are in the mid teens but that doesn’t include rice.  White and brown rice are $2 to $3.
They have a sampler appetizer that was excellent.
So were the Pad Thai, drunken noodles, and chicken and cashew nuts.   However I asked for medium spicy and it was very mild (to me at least)  so if you want spicy, make sure you tell them “very spicy”.
Nice atmosphere in the restaurant and the staff were helpful also.<//Review><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80844876f85fd6ad:0x64110fd659a3245c<//Gmap_id><rate>5< /rate></record>

Can we put more than 5 stars?  I have never had an experience like this in my life!  Came in right before they were closing.  Big wedding party.  Sat us right away.  Service was fast, efficient and superb.  Everyone ordered something different, EVERYTHING was exceptional.  And to top it off, they didn't even charge us!  We still don't know why they did this for us...beyond flabbergasted!< /review>

This place is POPULAR!! We went on a Thursday for lunch and it was PACKED! Reservations are a must - we didn't have a reservation, so we decided to sit at the bar rather than wait for 45 minutes. We tried the appetizer sampler. The Thai bruschetta were THE best! I had the chicken eggplant with brown rice and it was delicious, brought some home for lunch the next day. The glass jellyfish and sardine school lighting was the perfect decor - wow!< /text>

The tofu ball had a golden crunch outside, which was the perfect complement to the soft tofu texture.  There was no side of sweet Thai chili sauce, which I detested anyway. The tofu was however very cleverly paired off with a sweet, sour and tangy cucumber relish sprinkled with toasted cashews. That kicked off an amazing contrast to the tofu when savored together and created a huge day and night difference!< /review>

<review>We always get the same thing... peanut noodles, satay, and Thai bruschetta.... so great! This time I also got the cucumber salad and added grilled chicken. Everything was excellent. Great flavors. Expect to spend over $50 for lunch for 2 though! We had lunch here with our two year old granddaughter. We decided to sit outside. The service was good and the starter platter was so very delicious! Even our two year old enjoyed the food. My cocktail was yummy too.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>The wait staff was excellent.  They were slow to deliver the soup then delivered my meal immediately.   The tuna was cooked perfect but the presentation was poor with too much sauce.  The sauce is so strongly flavored it over powered the vegetables.  Maybe it was a poor entree choice or a bad day in the kitchen.  I will try again.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80844876f85fd6ad:0x64110fd659a3245c</gmap_id></record>

Every dish has flavors that are deep and rich.

This place has always been one of my favorite Thai restaurants. I love the whole menu but recently I’ve been loving the fire curry with vegetables. You can get it with rice or I like it with the fire rice too. The lark dish is unreal - so tasty. The wine list is good. They have TVs and will play sports games. The bar is super cool. Plenty of parking. There is something food wise for everyone too.</text>

< Review>
This is our favorite place for date night and to take family when they're in town. The food NEVER disappoints and the restaurant itself is stunning! They have a good variety of options, everything I've tried is delicious, and for the most part they're consistent when it comes to flavor and portions, although sometimes things are much spicier than a previous time having the same dish. Drinks and desert are great! However, we do have a big complaint when it comes to some of the service. The host has an attitude and gives us a hard time about seating. They always say we'll have to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to hours... really, HOURS?? The ridiculous part is that there are ALWAYS empty tables and we end up basically demanding to be seated in one of the several empty tables after being brushed off either to the bar or to the patio when it's freezing out. Mind you, we try making a reservation every time and the phone is either busy or they say they aren't taking any, yet there remain several empty tables each time they say this. The waiters and bartenders are usually pretty nice, so we tip a good amount. I was also disappointed that after our waiter (well, bartender since they never sat us at an empty table) offered to box up the half of my meal I hadn't eaten, and found later when I opened it that she did not put the tails from my prawns that I had set aside in the trash and instead MIXED THEM WITH MY FOOD. What?? It had to have been obvious to her and it was just plain rude or laziness. We are easy to please and courteous, so after having the same problems so many times after coming here and spending $100-200 each time, I'm pretty disappointed and ready to find a new spot.</Review>

Their menu is greatly pared down since they moved from the original location and I will never understand why they refuse to put Thai iced coffee on the menu. They serve hot coffee, so what's the problem?
The food is well prepared, but it's very limited. It's also a noisy crowded space...< /Text>

One of the worst experiences I have ever had. We made a reservation but were still forced to wait for our table. Once at our table we were ignored by our waitress for 30 minutes. My friend and I happen to be the only minorities in a Thai restaurant that was otherwise completely white this evening. After 30 minutes our waitress finally comes to take our orders and apologies saying "it's my first day". But somehow she managed to check up on nearby tables around us multiple times while we waited the whole time. We voiced our displeasure and then were told "you guys are the ones being mean". At that point we were already in a bad mood and the food was nothing special. I left a 10% tip to reflect the service but was chastised by our waitress despite me explaining we had horrible service and my tip reflected it. The restaurant seemed very elitist and it's hard not to believe this wasn't a race issue based on the evidence. I would never recommend this place again, there are better hole in the wall Thai restaurants in Santa Rosa, ones that are able to serve you without the subtle racism.<//Text>

Oysters were good.  Decent beer selection.  Their version of larb is different from larb I've had before but it was a dish I would order again.  My friend ordered cashew chicken and said it was great.  It was busy so I'm not sure why they close at 9:30 but no big deal.<//review>

<Review>The food is great but the front desk people are incredibly rude.  We had confirmed reservations through open table at 3:00pm only to have our party arrive for my Father's Day lunch to be told that they close from 3-4.  No apologies.  We asked them to correct open table and we were asked to leave.  Sea Thai went from my favorite restaurant to one I will no longer patronize.<//Review>< pics>

<time>1551919060983< /time><rate>4<//rate><Review>This is definitely my favorite spot for Thai food in the area. They are almost always busy but luckily I order mostly take out. Very aesthetic decor on the inside. My go to is always the yellow chicken curry. 4 star simply because I think they could expand on their menu with how much success they have. Everytime I go to eat here I want to try something different but nothing usually catches my eye so I always order the same thing. Their happy hour menu is great if you want to just order a bunch of appetizers and try a lot of stuff. Their sister restaurant SEA Noodle Bar in Coddingtown has a better menu and easily the best oysters I've ever had.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Review>spectacular flavors that build on traditional thai. pumpkin curry is famous but all the curries are great. they are not afraid to really make it spicy which is a relief. mysteriously they don't do sticky rice, which is a disappointing, but they do have brown rice which is nice. excellent attentive service. open kitchen is fun and i have yet to experience smoke issues cited by other reviewers.< /Review><rating>4< /rating>< GmapID>

I am only a few times a year in SR. I walked by this place at lunchtime and thought I need to come back for dinner. Friendly service, excellent beer. While not exactly Thai the food was some of the best Asian fusion I ve ever had. Highly recommended. I ll make it a point to come back.</Review>

<Text>One of my favorite places to eat. Location is pretty good since Montgomery Village is rarely totally full on parking. Customer service is nice. Green curry is great, pad thai is great, lamb shanks are great (even though I was skeptical about the Sriracha choice at first). The salad was a bit salty. I love the firecracker shrimp as a starter. Tempura is good, fire chicken is good (maybe a little salty). Portions aren't huge, but with sharing an appetizer and eating a meal, I think it's enough. I see other people leaving with boxes regularly, so I assume I just really REALLY like the food.

Good desserts too (not sure if they still do desserts since last time I got one was a few years back).<//Text><pics>None</pics></record>

Great food and decor, this place was busy but not full, yet they wouldn't seat us immediately (15 min wait) even though there were numerous tables prepped for diners ... so we ate at the bar. Food is a bit pricey, still it was very enjoyable.< /text>

<text>Very nice ambience, different from many other Thai places whose ambition is to simply blend in and get by.
This was our first visit. We just dropped in for a quick lunch. The wait was reasonable. Staffs were pleasantly professional with none of that family run business vibe. This is a good sign and one that set apart Sea Thai from being one of the average Thai restaurants.
We ordered the northern style curry noodle, aka the famous "Kao Soi" we have heard so much from youtube peeps; ..and Spicy beef noodle soup.
For the spicy noodle-I call this the Thai Pho, it consisted of rice noodle, pieces of green, bean sprout, sliced jalapeno, and basil in clear broth. The broth (ahh )had that lovely depth of clean naturally obtained pork/chicken bones flavor. This was the best part and the most important element of this Pho. My eyes popped at first sip..Mmm..yum. the noodle was a tad overcooked but ok; the beef slices were plentiful but a bit too thick and therefore tough. This can be easily fixed by slice that beef thinly when it is half frozen, then place the beef slices on top of noodle and drench the hot beautiful broth from the top...voila! That's how I like it..I don't know about you. :)) (cost $16)
As for kao soi, there's much adjustments to be done. Let's start with the choice of egg noodle. It was too skinny! and, therefore, could not withstand the steamy curry. As the noodle continue to be cooked in that hot broth, by the time we could handle the noodle it was already overcooked. Also, all other components were lost in that thick stew like curry, so thick. The chicken slices and shrimp in it too were tough and chewy. (cost $20)
Between the two I might go with Pho again, perhaps asking for tofu or chicken instead, if allowed.
a Friendly FYI to staffs: when serving noodle dishes, please provide chopsticks as soon as you know there will be noodle, since it's the utensils appropriate for noodle consumption.
To be continued.</text>< gmapID>

The food was excellent. Love the decor and the lights. I'd give them a 5 but no one who worked there tonight cracked a smile. Getting a glass of wine or a bottled beer took a really long time to get delivered to the table (about 15 minutes). I don't recommend the outdoor patio with the heat lamps unless you are dressed in your snugglies. They turn them off when it's time for you to quit lingering. Did I mention the food was excellent? Will definitely go back.<//review>

<Text>This is not real Thai food. It's a very westernized version of Thai. The beef was like a stew soup and the drunken noodles were very sweet, not spicy at all. Definitely did not enjoy the food.</Text>< userid>

<Text>The new place rocks !! Great layout, variety of table options, (large island bar, outside patio, high tables, corner booths etc) quieter now too inside. The same great food and service, with a fun decor inside. If you've been to the old place, your jaw will drop at the new one.<//Text>< user_name>

Oh yeah!
Frequent diner's card here would give us plenty of miles, but it doesn't exist. We love SEA Thai and it may be telling that they always recognize us.OK so it's only a few blocks from home - but that doesn't stop us from enjoying the fare and service here.
It really is SEA Thai Bistro as the SEA is an acronym for South East Asian...
They have an excellent menu and wine list as well as some tasty micro-brews.
It is not all Thai cuisine, but Asian-pacific fusion presented in artistic fashion.
The flavors are always extraordinarily pleasing. The specials are just that.
Do NOT tell all your friends about this local gem - it's very nice to get a seat easily and enjoy the personalized service. Just kidding really - take your friends thaty will thank you.</Review>

California fusion food.  Designer interior - Chihuly style glass. Extensive alcohol menu and bar in addition to the food.  You do need reservations.  You might be able to walk in at an odd time but if you want to sit outside you need to call ahead.  Some of the seats are romantic but this is an awkwardly shaped restaurant with a lot of tables near the kitchen.< /Text>

< review>
Loud and unfriendly. The Hostess, while dressed to the 9's, seemed to busy and above lowlifes without a reservation. The food was delivered fast, but with a rush. The whole place seemed too rushed to care. We received the wrong bill. I ate at SEA Thai many times when it was at the Tomatina location. It was DIVINE. Either we got unlucky or it has changed. On the plus side I love the Chihuly inspired sea creatures dangling from the ceiling.<//review>

I was at Dale and Tony's restaurant, Thai Ginger Bistro when it opened in a tiny space in downtown Petaluma several years ago. A few years later they sold that  and opened SEA Thai.

I have eaten countless times at SEA, and I will really miss them when they leave Petaluma. But I will have no problem driving to any of their other locations (Santa Rosa, Marin), because it is so worth it.

Tony is a genius, it's that simple. The food is sublime - so fresh, so beautiful, so flavorful. And the service is genuinely warm, welcoming and friendly. They greet you with their lovely smiles, and really do everything they can to not only please you, but to surprise and delight.

I can't recommend SEA Thai Restaurant highly enough. They certainly deserve every accolade, and I look forward to their continued success.

This a MUST visit dining experience!</review>

I have been eating here for a few years now and I have noticed a serious decline in the Pad Thai noodles entree. The last time i had it the noodles were gummy and stuck together the sauce was a bit strong, and I had only 2 prawns in the whole dish! I don't personally like how the alfalfa sprouts or whatever they are, are not tossed in the entree. I wont be eating here anymore, it was good when it was good:(< /review>

Amazing food, especially the appetizers!!!! Doesn't look like much from the outside, but worth the trip in. Service was friendly and fast, great wine selection, but it's the food that really sets this place apart. For main dishes, we oredered the red pumpkin curry and the green curry. The pumpkin really stood out. If you like spicy food get this extra spicy. The appetizers that are to die for: panko-crusted tofu, mushroom potstickers, deep-fried mushrooms with peanut sauce, and spring rolls which you wrap in lettuce and pile up with topping and sauce. Super yum! We'll be back here every time we come to Santa Rosa.<//review>

We were on vacation in Santa Rosa and looking for a new seafood place to eat. Sea Thai Bistro was perfect. The entire decor was right for the seafood place, flying fish and jellyfishes by the ceiling added very cool atmosphere to the restaurant. Bistro has a very cool patio, we had to wait for our table there but it was worth it.
Dinner: we had an Alaskan halibut with steamed veggies + green beans, they were super tasty and all dish was presented with the spicy green sauce.
The entire food was phenomenal, full of flavors and spices. We loved it. We also ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc from Balverne winery at Russian River Valley- an excellent complement to our exotic sea dish.
Dessert: we had a panna cotta
presented in a very elegant way and it was delicious also.
Our weiter Tom did a great job, we had just one misunderstanding about bottled italian water but it was fixed right the way. The water was amazingly smooth and very good. Overall we had a very good experience and we will be back for sure.
Tony Ounpamornchai ,you and the entire team did very good job, thank you all.</Text>

<Review>This is not Gabrillia Belmonte ... She is my grandchild..... they recommended this place since we re new to the area....
First: my drink was wrong but I drank it with no problem!
Second :we came in at at 8:00 & the person at desk said she would seat us when table was ready, did not happen!!!!
Third: my husband had to remind her that we were still there at bar and there were numerous tables open, SHE SAID "I FORGOT" :(
Fourth : the food was great but by that time we were seated we were passed being hungry.....
Know you have moved & great comments on your new place but maybe you should look what is taken place cause it is not the same!

We will be back but hope it is not that we sit at bar for 45 min!!!!!!
This review is not GABRIELLA BELMONTE , thats my granddaughter and they recommended this!!

Maybe you should not have moved, reviews were not so good :{<//Review><response>None< /response>< Pics>

<review>Sprint is a joke!! Honestly I had Metro before and the service was more reasonable and better customer care. $290 per month for two lines?? They are a joke. I prefer investing that money towards my mortgage! They had us on line for 2hrs when trying to cancel our account.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

My experience at the Encino sprint store location was absolutely perfect from the moment I walked in, to the moment I left. The manager Felipe, is a true professional and made sure to go the extra mile to ensure my satisfaction. The store technicians were very helpful and knowledgeable. The representatives at this store really went above and beyond my already high expectations. I couldn't be happier with my experience. Thanks, Felipe!! If you plan to go into this store make sure you call and see if you can set an appointment with Felipe.</text>

Awesome!!! This store has great customer service! Everyone there was super nice & professional.
I drove out there to get my cracked screen fixed, although they had an issue and ran out of the same color face plate that i originally had, he didn't repair it. When I went back to pick it up 30 minutes later, they were going to close. He didn't fix my phone but had to drive back the next day! Bummed.....
Otherwise everything was great & may switch over to Sprint service because they are currently having a great deal!!!!< /Text>

There was a Sim card error just came up and I could not get on the internet.  I was asked if I needed any help by Mounir and he was able to resolve my problem immediately.  Mounir was very oriented in excellent customer service. I left very happy and grateful that he resolved my problem.

Would definitely give negative stars if it were possible. I’ve been to this location on many occasions. There are always 5-6 employees available, but when you arrive and check in on the iPad, no one greets you, approaches you, or even acknowledges your existence for 20 minutes—minimum!! AND, the employees are often not handling clients, yet you wait and wait and wait and there is just an overall feeling of employee indifference when it comes to customer service. Awful.< /text>

Eliseo is the best person to go o when your lucking to get a new line. I haven't experienced  this kind of service in so long it is really refreshing that there is still people who truly care about their jobs and the service they provide

Aside from opening new lines I have also fixed my Galaxy s9+ which shut down on me out of no wear and I had gone to 2 different stores that told me they couldn't do anything about it but the tech Hank was able to get my phone up and running in such a short time I definatly  suggest you ask for Hank and Eliseo when coming in to Sprint<//Text>

Let me start by saying THANK YOU FELIPE a true professional. Was referred by a friend to ask for him. Switch over 4lines from verizon. Felipe was very knowledgeable and helpful. Best feeling is when it feels like you being help by a friend/family member. My recommedation is if you can schedule an appointment with him do so. most importantly i left with great devices and was able to save almost $100 monthly. I will definitely be referring friends and family over.<//text>

I went in one day because my phone lease was up. I didn't make an appointment ahead of time but I got in when the line was short.
This one woman was upset and taking it out on one of the sales reps (which I cannot help but think this happens a lot based on reviews).
My turn was next and the gentleman she was yelling at was Elisio who was nothing but kind and helpful to me so I have no idea what the other woman was upset about.
I picked out a phone with much assistance because I was between two phones.
Elisio and his crew were really nice to me, made sure everything went smoothly, that I was happy with my phone, and that I had a good experience. They even have good jokes if you have a sense of humor.
After that one woman peeled off in the parking lot and called to speak to a manager I couldn't help but feel the need to post this because her behavior was atrocious. Bad days happen but doesn't mean being a decent human being goes out the window.
I've been to this sprint store before and had great experiences every time, by myself and with family. They make things simple so everyone can understand. I've tried out other Sprint stores due to unsatisfying customer experiences and stopped at this one.
Common courtesy goes a long way!< /Text>

I changed my 1 star to 5 star because Stacey helped me with my concerns and fixed the mess. 1 star for Ms. M. I thought all transactions went well until we found out that Ms. M didn’t really explain everything to us properly. I was so disappointed and felt embarrassed from my Auntie because we got tricked by her (FREE this FREE that. Then boom your paying for everything FREE that she talked about in your bill) Just be honest with your customers and transactions please.<//Review>

<review>Very Rude staff. They convinced me to add a line with auto-pay to give me a cheaper monthly price but after a few month the charges got doubled and they told me the promotional price got expired. They never told me it would get expired. Now I am paying for the line that I don't even use.. NEVER trust them. Get everything in writing.. they cheat customers to get promotions...<//review><Date>1551905557812<//Date><user_id>109866608804726854221< /user_id><user_name>Soheil</user_name><GmapID>0x80c2999c09ac6387:0x28de3e69f3349379</GmapID><Rating>2< /Rating>< Pictures>

Unbelievable. Truly the worst experience possible as we were given a contract and an estimate of $221 per month. We are now paying $351 every month. Staff keeps telling me they have reduced it and given me a credit. No reductions and no credit. Manager on down just want to move on and do nothing even after i provided them our initial contract and documents…They simply want to tire you out and get you off the phone and then do nothing.< /text>

Very Rude staff. They convinced me to add a line with auto-pay to give me a cheaper monthly price but after a few month the charges got doubled and they told me the promotional price got expired. They never told me it would get expired. Now I am paying for the line that I don't even use.. NEVER trust them. Get everything in writing.. they cheat customers to get promotions...< /Text>

The staff at this store is very rude and do not care about their customers. They cannot provide the right product or warranty information to to their customers. If I could I would have give them no stars, but unfortunately, that is not a choice. When my contract is up, I will switch to another carrier!</Review>

<review>My old phone broke down and stopped working about two months ago.I went to a sprint store to fix it they offered me another new phone and just put the old one on standby plan. The standby plan was offered for $8.99. I got the iPhone X and they put my old iPhone 7 on seasonal plan after I got my bill for the first month. My bill went up over $200. I checked my bill...guess of what!? I was still getting charged for my old phone and plan and also insurance on my broken phone, for standby seasonal plan for $14.99 instead of $8.99. My total bill was $391 while I was told my bill will be for only $86.
I am very dissatisfied by sprint. This company never stands on its word. You’ll get different bill every month! They have hidden charges and surcharges which are none sense. The sales people just get excited to sell you something and mess your bill up. This is the last thing you wanna deal with, SPRINT!<//review>< user_id>

I did contact Sprint before going to the store and requested a note be put on the account. I do not know if that is something that made a difference in customer service or I just got lucky this time.

<Text>This is the worst corporate sprint store I have ever been to. They are all rude as heck and do not deserve to have a job. I can not believe that sprint employs people like this. Shame on Sprint for letting their workers do this, to the customers that keep Sprint working. They all just sit around and let Sprint customers sit and wait for hours at a time. When they do call your name they are so rude its unbelievable. I will never get another phone with Sprint because of this. As soon as my lease is up I will be going to another carrier.</Text><Resp>None<//Resp><userid>112202531920882541137</userid>< time>

I wish I could do less than one star, way less. This store has buunch of unknowledgable young kids leading by an unkowledagble manager that doesnt know who to help the clients.
I have been getting extra charge month after month and spending time on correcting the issue that needed to be done at the first time.
Unfortunately there is no upper managemenr in reach and noone know who is whom.

They lie to sell you products and services and after that you are on your own.

Please stay away as far as you can or you will get burned like I did.< /Text>

In a nutshell I could just say my experience was horrible I thought about canceling my contract with them
There was 2 people in the store a staff member  made me sign in and wait now there were 3 members of staff there and 1 was assisting a customer the other one was just finishing up with a customer then one was just on the computer as one of them finish up they said just wait one more minute sir and proceed to have a complete conversation about their plans the evening got up and walked out then the same one who told me to wait came out the back 15 mintues later and said sir have you signed in to be helped I told him I checked in when u told me to and watched you guys proceed to carry on a full conversation dropped of my phone came back later to pick up my phone and was told to wait now there was 5 members of staff in the store 3 were helping customers 2 were just on the computer the one who helped me gave me a complete attitude to get my phone< /review>

<Text>I hate giving reviews because the public can be seriously difficult to deal with and idiots in general.  I get that!  But I have to say,  this is not the best place for people to go.   The reps speak like 13 year old kids.  Uneducated and lack of appropriate customer service skills.  (not saying 13 yr old's are dumb for you sensitive ones, I just wouldn't hire 13 year old's to run a sprint store).  The reps are difficult to talk to.  They are busy but they also don't seem to work very hard.   People are just another number to them.  I sat in the store for about 2 hours within my 3 separate visits and watched them and how they communicate.  It was kind of entertaining seeing the level of rudeness and lack of care they show their customers.  I'm sure their hands are tied with rules and regulations, however better training could give the reps the knowledge and people skills on how to deal with people and phone issues.
Pick another store...You might have to still go through the same process but the employees have to be better.  Cant get worse.  I would hope!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><user>104598366266889318194<//user>< Date>

Terrible customer service from the Asurion Manager, who wouldn't allow me to keep the loaner phone for an extended time while my phone is being repaired by Samsung.  Why would you want to leave the customer without a phone.  I called Asurion customer service and they said that it is not up to them, it is up to the Manager.  You think the Asurion Manager at this location would have had compassion and consideration.  I guess being kind to others is out the window.< /text>

< review>
I went there to get 3 new phones as I was due for an upgrade on my business line. I have a business account with Sprint that has been grandfathered in, and nothing comes close to that pricing. The salesman, "Justice" did everything in his power to persuade me to change my plan to a new lease plan, and when that didn't work he tried to charge me $100.00 extra for each individual phone ($300.00). He kept telling me that my plan would more expensive than his plan. I left the store and called Sprint directly and got the phones for $300.00 less. Why would the price for the actual physical store be more than online?. "I have no idea, so just beware of this scam".<//review>

<Review>We have been Sprint customers for a long time and since we hold business account we have around 20 phones on it. I wanted to upgrade my phone today to get a new one. The only options what sales person offered was lease phone and pay $20 each month or buy it for $200 but in this case they must add $25 to the bill (still don't know why). So basically I have to take a lease because it's cheaper but after 2 years you need to return phone. I called my sales representative and he said that its a bull sh... And we can order phone online for $200 and don't increase our bill. We spent 2 hours waiting for the manager because we wanted to ask WHY they make their employees make customers get a lease or they'll make them pay more. Manager's response was that there many ways how to buy a phone and retail store has its own rules and regulations.
And that loud music (actually two different stations at the same time)...
When we finally went outside it was such a pleasure to see angry sales person face in the window.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Ohhh, where to begin on my woes with this place.....  Overall and in a nutshell they desperately need a strong ops structure revamp to optimize their processes, which speeds up wait time, which in turn yields happy customers..... who spend more money!!  Yet, time and time again I venture to this sub service shop due to it's proximity to mi casa.  Guess it ain't all that bad after all....lol</review>

<review>This place made me leave their store crying at least 3 times. The WORST customer service EVER!!!! They ALL act like they own the store. Go to Lacienega or Westwood instead. They treated me like a human and would give them a 5 star anytime. This Encino store deserves ZERO stars. They hurt me BIG time. Made me feel like CRAP!!!!!!! They ban together.</review>< username>

<Review>I never write reviews, but this is one of the worst customer service I have dealt with in a long time.  There always rude.  WORST WORST WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE INCLUDING THE MANAGER.  They made a mistake with putting us in an appointment and really didn't care that we took the time out of work to make it to the appointment time and said they never set that appointment time.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Inexperienced staff, no follow through, passing the buck mind-set. Average wait time is over 40 minutes and Go look at the seats they want you to wait on.  This multi billion dollar company hasn't changed those old decreped seats since 1998.< /Review>< pictures>

These people simply give wrong information to sell their service.

My advice is to find other store.<//Review>

I called 3 times and finally I got to place an order. The lady said 45 min to delivery. It’s been 1hr and 15 min and they haven’t even cared to call me to let me know what was going on. I called again and they said that the delivery guy is leaving now 🙄 really? SO UNPROFESSIONAL!!!</Text>

Cheap, cheap, cheap! ingredients so cheap the pizza wasn’t even worth the price. The service was... weird (best way I could describe it). Save yourself and stay away from this place.</Text>

<Review>Valentino's Pizza location is one of my favorite pizza restaurants in Costa Mesa. It's conveniently in a shopping plaza on Fairview and Wilson, so you can't miss it. I have ordered from here many times both dining in and for delivery. The portions are generous and made with fresh ingredients. You can really taste the difference when compared to other pizza restaurants.

Some of my reasons on why I choose this location rather than others is because of the quick friendly service, generous portions, and price. If you decide to for carry out, it takes about 15 minutes. Other places I am waiting for 20 - 25 minutes, which is absolutely ridiculous. There are also no gimmicks at Valentino's Pizza, just friendly service and quality food.

My favorite pizza here is the BBQ Chicken. The pizza is packed with so much flavor and is just an amazing pizza. I also recommend the calzones. Go with the steak and you won't be disappointed. I heard good things about the desserts, but I'm generally stuffed because it's so much food.

I highly recommend Valentino's Pizza. The food is delicious and they provide quality service. Keep in mind they also offer pizza delivery because other locations do not. There's is no other pizza restaurant in Costa Mesa that compares!</Review>< Pics>

I've ordered on a walkin basis and the owner's always pleasant and the pizza is ready and delicious.  I ordered for delivery for the 1st time. Wait time was 25 minutes after being told it would be 30 to 35 minutes.  I highly recommend this pizzeria.< /Review>

Valentino's Pizza has a great pizza and Italian cuisine menu.  They have super fast delivery and a friendly staff.  You can even grab "Pizza by the Slice"  deal at lunch.  Their dinning room is comfortable and has a flat screen TV.<//text>

It's about time we got a place that has pizza by the slice!!!  I was at the Laundromat at Fairview & Wilson and tried Valentino's Pizza.  It's about time we got a place that has pizza by the slice!!!  The pizza is delicious and the service is super friendly.     Also, they have a huge menu including Italian entrees and deserts.  Next time I need a pizza for delivery, I'm calling Valentino's.</text>

<Review>Do NOT order from here!!!! I am from out of state and when I ordered my pizza an hour before they closed it was never delivered and no one even attempted to call me!!! They claimed that a male called after me referred to my number and had the pizza delivered to another address. Even if that were the case I didn’t get my dinner and I’m six months pregnant.

< review>
I schedule an appointment for 6:00pm after 11:26am ad Mitchell responded to my disputed claim.
Where he lied was that I never called to cancel about 30 minutes later.  He also lied that I provided my credit card information, which is when the receptionist provides cancelation details. '
They had my credit card on file from 7 months prior and never had stated anything about a cancelation fee when I called, or I wouldn't have booked an appointment.
I can respect a cancelation fee for the employees, but without mentioning it to me when booking an appointment, and me trying to be respectful and cancel within 30 minutes to an hour of my initial call that was 6 hours ahead of the appointment. I think you should read a book up respecting your customers because I will forever tell every person I talk to about massage to avoid your location and your competition .02 miles away would be a better choice.</review>

Deborah is the esthetician at this location and she is wonderful! She did a truly amazing job and she is such a kind person.  She went out of her way to make me feel comfortable throughout my service. My skin looks great and I’m so pleased with my treatment. I will be back to see her again soon.</Review>

Sandy is AMAZING!  She is not only incredibly welcoming, but she is so knowledgeable and definitely the best (and I sincerely mean this) deep tissue masseuse I have ever been treated by! Glad that Massage Heights opened (safely!) so that I could join.< /text>

<Text>I was surprised/impressed at the overall quality of experience at Massage Heights. This was a comprehensive massage, they go so far as to tailor to your specific needs, giving massage "therapy" a new meaning for me. This was an unbelievably clean establishment with friendly interactions from start to finish. If you are going for the first time, ask for HANNAH, not only was she a great massage therapist but very nice to interact with and created a comfortable environment. Most of the massages I've had left bruises but this was above and beyond no pain what soever. This so far has been the most superior massage experience I've had. Highly recommend. Also there ample parking. 2 thumbs up.< /Text>< pics>

I have been coming here for over 3 years. When my favorite massage therapist left it took a few tries before I found the right fit.

Thank goodness I found Hannah! She gives the BEST deep tissue massage. She is great at her job and is the nicest human you will ever meet. I always look forward to our monthly sessions.

If you haven't been satisfied with deep tissue massage you've received in the past, look no further. Book an appointment with Hannah today!<//review>

Today was my first time at massage heights and let me tell you their service is phenomenal!

It is a very relaxing and good experience to get a massage. They are able to stretch the muscle in a way that can't be done by yourself, so it kind of loosens you up for a few days, and is a relaxing thing to look forward to. Cera is the person I go to and she is good at doing massages.</Text>

<text>I've been taking facials for 20 years. The 1st time facial here was average. The 2nd time I visited I took elevation which was charged. I saw the same lady who did the 1st time facial "Tonya".
When she started the elevation 1st I told her I was feeling burning sensation, the room is super dark so she can't see a thing. She said it's normal. My skin being brown you can't see the effect of a reaction if you don't pay close attention. This elevation elsewhere is done post the facial. Next she choose to start the facial, I felt my skin was bleeding. I asked her to stop and can't take it anymore. So unpaid for facial and elevation. When I mentioned politely about what happened, the lady at the front office asked me to visit elsewhere and that I already signed. This was pretty rude. I was so scared since then that I didn't go anywhere. My friend recommend a place at newport and when I shared my experience she mentioned that the elevation I opted should be done post facial. This place has inexperience staff. And the front office is very rude. You guys I not doing any favor for me, I'm paying and you are giving the services. And if you want a particular race to visit your place, do mention it on a board.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I’ve been getting regular massages for several years. I recently moved to the area and spent months trying out various expensive spas, and was so glad to finally stumble upon Massage Heights! I was a little skeptical of the membership program to be honest, but it’s actually a great value and cost savings. The location is very clean, nicely decorated and provides a relaxing environment. And even better, the massage therapists are fantastic (Grace is the best!). Plus you get discounts if you want to exceed your monthly massage or even throw in a facial every now and then. Highly recommend this place!<//Review>< Pictures>

I got a massage for my father to surprise him but when I asked how it was he said it was the worst massage he's ever had, and that the therapist didn't even know what he was doing. That might be a bit of a stretch but the point was the therapist wasn't really good at all. Disappointed. Not to mention the price was insane🙄< /text>

Went in with 3 of my co-workers for a mini retreat from work and they were able to service all of us without making an appointment. I would highly suggest making one since its difficult to get a spot before of 3pm. Overall the massage was great and my co-workers enjoyed themselves as well. Would deff return.< /Text>< pictures>

The girl that did my massage was super chatty and focused on areas I had asked her not to worry about. But, I let them know when I left and they called me and asked me to come back and get a second massage. The 2nd trip was SO GREAT. Quiet, relaxing, perfect pressure. Was thrilled. I still think their monthly program is a bit pricey for what they offer, but I like the location of this place.< /Review><Name>Audrey Hougan< /Name><time>1408725867526</time>< Gmap_id>

< review>
So far I've paid $360 for two mediocre massages--clearly not a good deal.

Mitchell Simon, the owner/operator of this branch will make every attempt to talk you into buying a membership, but then make it very difficult to cancel.

The only way he will allow anyone to cancel is if you visit him in-person. I've made repeated attempts to cancel over the phone and he refuses.

Even though the contract I signed states that I have 90 days post-cancellation to use my credits, Mitchell lied and told me that I will be unable to use my credits unless I continue paying him $59 a month.

Should I have thought twice about giving this guy my credit card information? Yes, I absolutely should have. Does that mean I should refrain from warning you of making the same mistake? Nope.< /review>

My wife and I have been members here for a while, and I want to pay this business back in a small way, so here I am. We alternate between scheduling our massages 5-10 days in advance and booking the day before or the day of our appointment depending on what our work schedules are like and how much stress we are currently experiencing. In any case, the staff is helpful and accommodating. We of course can't count on booking with a specific therapist when we book with so little notice, but luckily every therapist we've met has done an admirable job, and we have never had a bad experience here. This tendency to occasionally book at the last minute has in fact been beneficial, as my wife and I have both met therapists that way that we probably would not have otherwise met, as we both met therapists fairly early on that we were quite happy to continue booking when they are available.

I'd like to specifically compliment three therapists - Scott, Briana, and Hernan. All three are friendly, really know what they are doing, and are responsible for the best massages I've received in my life. All three consistently work extremely hard during their massages, and strive to make sure that the customer's particular needs are met. Much of my work is physical (I do extensive field work as a scientist and work as a SCUBA instructor on the side) so I frequently come in with deep knots, extensive muscle soreness, and heavy tension. With all three of these therapists I've felt like my mind was being read, so intuitively were they able to isolate and dig in to each knot and tense muscle group. All three are also quite strong; I like heavy, hard pressure, particularly in my back and arms, and I have never been disappointed. Scott, Briana, and Hernan - if you see this review, you have a very satisfied customer, and I think you three are awesome!

The operation itself is well-organized and efficient. Booking can be conveniently done over the phone, online, or in person, and I've never failed to receive an emailed reminder before my appointment. The rooms and bedclothes are clean, the music is soft and pleasant, and the general ambiance is quite relaxing. The aromatherapy scents are pleasant without being overpowering, and the lotions used don't seem to leave an unpleasant scent or residue. The owner, Mitchell, also makes it a point to talk with the customers to ensure we are happy and to make us feel welcome and valued.

I look forward to being a patron here for a long time to come!< /text>

I enjoy my membership here, like the great ambiance and massage therapists. Have been coming for more than a year now, I had a favorite therapist and felt upset when she left. However now I have Wenzhi and Stephany, both amazing! Nice conversations, relaxing massages, even though a little pricy, I guess we just have to pay for all the good stuff.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I have had two facials with Masayo and really enjoyed both of them! She is very gentle with her work, but makes sure the facial does what it needs to. She makes sure to talk to you about your skin beforehand so that she can choose the right product for you during the treatment so nothing stings or burns. I also enjoy that she tells you the type of product she is putting on your face before she does it so you know what she is doing and what to expect. Also, the Dermalogica products are fantastic. I have had no bad side effects after either facial and plan on receiving some more!< /review>< Pics>

Great friendly transaction.  10x15’ drive up unit reasonably priced & then found out special for 1/2 off for first 2-months no contract.
Answered all questions and read through agreement completely.
Seems strait forward transaction.
The location seems safe & secure.</review>

<review>As often said, people always can complain but never give a comment when due. I currently have a nonprofit with limited space and use E Street Storage to house our additional product and equipment material.  Now renting from this company for over 2 years; I am beyond pleased with the quality of service this company provides.   I sincerely appreciate their responsiveness and the way E Street conduct business.  Not only have I recommended this company to individuals but to others business as well because of their outstanding satisfaction with services and low rates. The grounds, office, storage units and bathrooms are super clean and I personally enjoy Mike (Store Manager) friendly and courteous attitude. I look forward to doing business with them for years to come if need be. I would also like to add; on one occasion I needed additional equipment to be moved from one location to another and was able to reserve their rental truck free of charge by being a tenant at e street storage!!!!!  Now that’s a deal!!!!<//review>< pictures>

<review>Always love the prices however I am happy they have updated this location with 3 cars per lane. Now..only if everyone followed the sun with pulling up versus failing to use the middle pump.

It's a madhouse. There's worse, more crowded Costco gas stations. But really, when you can park after you gas up........ Because you know you have to have a polish dog on the way home.
It's worth it.< /text>

<Text>Best prices on gas in town. The 91 octane costs less per gallon then most places 87 octane.

Costco does not offer an 89 octane fuel.

I have fuelled a 2008 Chevrolet Impala and 1996 Ford Crown Victoria with Costco's 91 octane and have had no performance issues unlike at some cheap gas stations.

A Costco membership card is required to fuel any vehicle at Costco.< /Text>< pics>

Excellent prices and top quality gasoline. You can pay with debit cards, visa or Costco cash card.  No cash accepted here and need costco membership to pump the gasoline. They also sell Diesel here< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The best place to load your car with gasoline still very accessible price and easy to fill from any side of the car and to avoid finding so many people, it is preferable to go between 9 to 2 in the afternoon, which is when the place is more unoccupied and Will not take long .......

<Text>If you value your belongings at all, DO NOT rent from this location!!!! I cannot stress this enough. I had my storage broken into one day and only a few tool bags were taken (stuff they could carry out by hand). The NEXT DAY my storage was hit again, this time they got everything worth taking! All that was left was couple totes with old clothes and one with random cords, basically stuff that was worthless to them. Anyways, the storage has a camera set up outside the door where my unit was located so I told the employee the timeline of events, n said she only needed to review one day to find out who it was, she would either see someone coming out with my belongings (huge husky tool chest on wheels is pretty noticable) but if she didn't see my belongings coming out then that means they are still in there, but in someone else unit. Its not that hard to figure out, I did the investigative work for her, but she did nothing except waste my time. I even filed a police report, but thanks to public storage lack of consideration and willingness to help out, I lost any chance for me to get my belongings back. She was rude, inconsiderate, constantly changing what she said the previous day, the company overall did ABSOLUTELY nothing to help me out! Just look at the pictures I'm posting. You can clearly see the lock was cut, 1st pictures are showing that just a few tool bags were missing, then you can see how much they took the 2nd day. With how uncooperative the employees were, I wouldn't be surprised if it was an inside job. Or they just don't care about their customers at all!</Text><Name>Christina Hall</Name></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Heidi and everyone I've talked to on the staff are incredibly knowledgeable, polite and professional.  Heidi was the representative that took my initial call, after talking to her I felt less stressed and never once did I feel mislead or she was 'hiding' anything.  She listened to my scatter brained questions answering them all without hesitation and by the end of our conversation I felt so much more at ease.
Yes, the gate situation is annoying but I know she has done what she can.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x809ad8e27cffde1d:0x1c903a593d301f76< /gmap_id></record>

Getting everything moved into a storage unit can be very stressful. People like Sam make it so easy! She was incredibly friendly and helpful.

The grounds are clean and the units are secure. I highly recommend this place.<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>5 stars for Cinnamon and staff! Amazing, helpful, and courteous. 4 stars overall because more dollies are needed. Ive never seen more than 2 out and theyre always being used. Also, it would be helpful to be able to have MORE access hours. 930-6pm, but closing at 5pm on weekends? 6 or 7am to maybe 7pm would be great. The storage place were moving to (another city) has hours from 6am-10pm Everyday!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This facility is fantastic, not only does it have good deals for move-in specials but the customer service is outstanding. Brian and Heidi are both very personable people who not only listen to the needs of the customer but take the time to find just the right storage space for you. I did not expect such great customer service and friendly people and when I was faced with it I was pleasantly surprised. I give it five stars but, i'd actually give it 10 if 10 were available.  Thank you Brian for all your help.< /review>

<review>I went to the facility at 4900 Roseville Road Sacramento California were I was welcomed by Heidi and Taylor. They were very warm and attentive to all my needs took me out to see the storage space. Upon seeing it was much too small so they continued and found me the perfect size storage. As my belongings or being offloaded into the storage space we went back to the office to handle the paperwork they were very professional all the items that I didn't think about such as mattress and bags tape. As I left their office I felt very secure and leaving my items in their care. So in closing I would like to give a special thank you to Heidi and Taylor☺</review>< pics>

It is NOT $1 for the first month. Your next month will also bounce the payment on their end, gaining a late fee and charged me double the rent, and threatened a preliminary lien on my unit, in under a month.

I used to work for a mini storage, so I know personally, this is NOT correct business practices for storage facilities. GO ELSEWHERE!!! I'm moving my things.<//Review>

<Text>Amazing storage spot!! Best experience at a Public Storage ever (have been a renter on and off for years!) I was helped by Denver- she was lovely- so knowledgeable, professional, upbeat, and kind!! It was pouring rain, I was late for work and I'd just moved to the area- she helped me feel right at home getting my things stored safely and quickly in a new town! She was even able to give me a great deal on the unit!! It's been a dream so far. This has genuinely been the best business experience I've had in North Highlands thus far. I felt as if they truly cared about me and the safety of my belongings. Their security and monitoring system seems on point too- which was important to me in the event I ever visit alone. Highly recommend!!</Text><gmap_id>0x809ad8e27cffde1d:0x1c903a593d301f76</gmap_id><user_id>115233962385176510294< /user_id>< resp>

The ONLY annoying thing is that their exit gate doesn't work, so u have to get out your car, go through the side gate, punch the code in, walk back to your car hop in, & try 2 beat the ENTRANCE gate before it closes. Other than that they are cool...great customer service</review>

< Review>
I needed a unit to store things while in the process of selling a home. I went to the Roseville location of Public Storage near my home because my son had a good experience with Public Storage in Santa Monica, CA. I am very happy I chose them because the excellent customer service I received from Julia Panasiuk was above my expectations. All the legalities were explained to me in language I could understand. Checking out  was so easy. Julia took the time to explain to me why I should keep the lock I purchased and what uses it could have. She went above and beyond in every way. The unit itself was just the right size and it was clean and easy to access. I will use Public Storage again when the need arises.</Review>

Was looking for a storage to store extra items I had in my garage. Went by the public storage in north highlands. Ben was extra helpful in finding me the right size space I needed. He also showed me the packing supplies that I would need to make my move in easier. I highly recommend this property to everyone who is in need of storage. Thanks Ben!<//text>

Really liked using this place. Lots of cameras and pretty tight on the hours (no late night tweakers walking around). The staff was great and the property was clean. Will definitely use this facility in the future.< /Review>

Great facility conveniently located and well staffed. I had my doubt's about getting a storage since the person I had talked to off site scheduled my appointment after hours. Seeing the postition I was in the manager offered to stay late the following day to ensure I got my unit. Great customer service , there's a lot to be said about someone willing to go above and beyond what they are required to do in order to accommodate a customers needs.</text>

<Text>Had my stuff stored here for about a year, initially I was worried considering the surrounding area but month after month without incident put my mind at ease. Rent is due on the first but they have a grace period which saved me plenty of times. Heidi was the one who helped me get everything setup and despite my frustrations with the reservation inaccuracies she was calm and collective and ready to help with a can do attitude. When all was said an done I had everything I needed thanks to Heidi. Even my move out was smooth and had no troubles at all. 10/10 would get a unit here again.<//Text>< resp>

<text>I am throughly satisfied with the customer service at this PS site, the management,and employees are all so personable, and it is a pleasure to give them my business. The site although not the most modern is well maintained, clean and very secure. If you need storage space definitely check out their business.< /text><gmap_id>0x809ad8e27cffde1d:0x1c903a593d301f76< /gmap_id><Response>None< /Response>< pics>

Ryan was professional all the way through and although he hasnt been doing this long he acted like a real professional thats been doing it for years. There was 5 storage units on the way here and it was his personality and his willing to find the right answers that made it worth it.< /Text>

<text>Setting up my storage in advance on-line made the selection of a storage facility easy! When I arrived, they were ready for me and they showed me the storage spaces they had available, which was what I had in mind. It was spotless, with no signs of insects. Access is great. I got all the necessary papers taken care of, including auto-payment on-line so I need not worry about being late. It just gets paid on time! The property managers, Linda and Christina were very polite and helpful, making this a great experience.I would highly recommend this facility to my friends, should they need storage space.<//text>< GmapID>

I'm not sure if the same manager works there.  But if she does, don't get your storage there. She's incompetent, not to mention, fat and ugly. The facility is fine, I've had my stuff there for quite awhile. But, I seriously i hate that manager. Pick another location if possible.</review>

Christina was great!!!!   She was polite, very knowledgeble. Answered all my questions without hesitation.  Very welcoming. She made my expierience so much more easier.  We all know how moving can be.  I have used other storage facilities and never have i had an experience like this.  I would recommend her location to anyone i know that needs a storage unit.<//Text>

We only need the storage for a month and Christina found us a dollar deal for a 10x30 unit. Both Ben and Christina are professional and we would highly recommend this storage location to our friends or anyone who's in need of a storage unit. Thanks you two!<//review>

The staff are very nice and friendly. I have 2 reasons for giving a low rating. 1. The restroom which USED to be open to the public now has a restroom sign on the door, but is padlocked and not available for storage renter's use. So for the past month or so, whenever I go to my unit to go thru it I have to either leave what I've taken out outside of my storage or try to hurry to put it all back into my unit (which is a large unit FILLED) and drive to the Starbucks or Panda Express on the corner before I piss my pants. 2. The dumpsters are locked now. Have been for almost a week. I see no point in this. It's like the people running the facility want it looking trashy by making their customers put their garbage BY the dumpster. Just a FYI, that's how it looks. Trashy. These 2 problems are very rude inconveniences that make me want to take my business else where and not recommend this facility to anyone.</Review>

My experience at Public Storage was one of relief. Kae and Michelle made it easy to work with them and not being pressured when what I consider valuables are in their storage facility. Bad experiences in the past led to unjustly relinquishing me of my storage when all I wanted was my personal pictures and paperwork. When the storage (not Public Storage) is going to auction my things anyway, why not take at least half of the storage cost to get my baby pictures and classwork, sport medals, etc., priceless memories. To think that all the person who buys the storage is going to do is throw those things in the dumpster was disheartening. I am ranting because you can guess that it has had an impact on me. But Public Storage made it easy for me to downsize if needed be and made it a simple process to move out. Thank you very much.<//review>

My experience at Public Storage was one of relief. Kae and Michelle made it easy to work with them and not being pressured when what I consider valuables are in their storage facility. Bad experiences in the past led to unjustly relinquishing me of my storage when all I wanted was my personal pictures and paperwork. When the storage (not Public Storage) is going to auction my things anyway, why not take at least half of the storage cost to get my baby pictures and classwork, sport medals, etc., priceless memories. To think that all the person who buys the storage is going to do is throw those things in the dumpster was disheartening. I am ranting because you can guess that it has had an impact on me. But Public Storage made it easy for me to downsize if needed be and made it a simple process to move out. Thank you very much.< /text>

< Review>
Heidi & Earleen are by far the greatest Public Storage people I've ever met m

my transaction went so smooth I cannot even believe how easy and smooth Heidi made it for me and I would recommend this public storage only not the other ones cuz I've been to the other ones I checked like 4 of them before I got to this one and this one was nowhere near where I was but I did it because Heidi. Obviously doesn't matter which facility cuz they're all the same and what have you but it's the customer service. I'll tell you that It don't matter where I'm at I'm coming back to this one</Review>

<Review>Christina helped me today I have nothing but positive feedback to give on her ,she does awesome work, but there is a man that lives on the property that always walks his dog.and always look in people's unit asking questions like he works for public storage but doesn't ,he makes me feel uncomfortable and like I am being watch on what I'm doing,not a good feeling to feel that way.   No privacy.  !!!!!< /Review><user>113787730510881202322<//user>< Pictures>

<Review>The manager here (Heidi) is simply wonderful.  Every problem I have had has always been quickly and kindly solved due to her knowledge and patience.  The entire staff is knowledgable, friendly and helpful.  Heidi and Sierra are the 2 who have been most involved in my problematic move-in and within the facility.  The grounds are clean and these ladys keep everything running smoothly 24/7.  The prices for their storage units are competative (well worth it too) with rules invorced and grounds kept clean.  I highly recommend this location of Public Storage for anyone needing to store a few extra items or an entire house.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x809ad8e27cffde1d:0x1c903a593d301f76<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<date>1378412870003< /date><rate>5< /rate><Review>My boyfriend and I were looking for a storage during this stressful time of moving houses. And we came into Roseville Road Public Storage and we met Christina and Kae. When we first walked in we were already irritated from looking at previous storages and their pricing. We mainly came in to look at the Public Storage prices on their units. So Christina urged the fact to go look at aunit so that we could get a better feel for the property. After discussing all of the features that Public Storage has, we definitely wanted to rent there.< /Review>< Pics>

They cut your locks for no reason and expect you to not have a problem with that. Slap liens when you were paid on time. Public storage your contact yes but it doesn't make it legal<//Review>

Dear Public Storage:

I have had a unit since November at the roseville road, north highlands, CA location #20214.  I want to give a big "Thank You" and thumbs up to my Tres Hermanas, Michelle, Kae and Christina.  These ladies individually have strong positive work ethics and great interpersonal skills. They work well together as a group and individually.I have had a chance to talk to each individually, and they all are incredibly hard working mom's who all have great leadership qualities and are confident in their individual strengths, but also are very supporting of each other and that lends for a really positive and super charged energy in and around the office and these girls are knowledgeable, friendly and have all the answers to all the questions regarding the who, what, where, whens and whys of the facility! YOU ROCK LADIES!!  Keep up the good work, and keep working well together, u r a great team!!

Sincerely

Erica Lieberman<//text>< Gmap_id>

John Calderon and his apprentice came to my rescue today! After a string of bad experiences with plumbers who were recommended to me or referred by my home warranty, I decided to venture out and find my own. Anderson Plumbing was the first to pop up and had the highest rating in San Diego. When I called, they answered immediately (last plumber hung up on me) and had someone at my door WITHIN AN HOUR (last plumber waited seven days before coming to my condo). John was so knowledgeable and friendly. (Both of them showed my dog lots of love, so bonus points there.) He was able to diagnose the problem immediately and even showed me the exact issue (so I knew he wasn’t just trying get me to replace a bunch of parts to drive up the cost). Although the fix was pricey, he was upfront about the cost and talked me through my options. They had the parts on hand to fix the water heater and waited until the hot water was running throughout the house before they left. Although larger companies can be a bit more expensive, it was 100% worth the extra money to use a reputable, legit company who came to my aid immediately and had a mini warehouse in their truck with everything they needed to fix the problem. Paying a couple extra bucks was worth avoiding the hassle I’ve been experiencing with 2-star rated companies who took a week to get here in the first place. John converted me to a loyal customer and I will only use Anderson Plumbing in the future. Also - John spoke volumes about the owners of the company and how generous they are with their employees and are wonderful people to work for — that’s the exact type of company I want to support!!<//Text>

<Review>I had to replace my water heater. I returned to Anderson's Plumbing because they made a very  strong impression on  me with their work about 11 years ago.  I phoned them again and Fernando and Abel performed the work.  They  were courteous, amicable and professional.  I will keep Anderson's Plumbing in my phone directory.  You can trust them to listen, perform the repairs with professionalism, good humor and friendliness.  Thank You for having an excellent business in our San Diego community!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Anderson Plumbing is on my speed dial and will be out go to for all of our plumbing needs!

Great job, extremely pleased!<//Review>< response>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>Gated valve failed on main irrigation valve. Digging required. First estimate came in at 535 for digging and replacement with 1/4 turn ball valve or plastic. Anderson came in at over 1500 for the same repair. I verified that it was the same exact repair. How can the same job cost $1000 more? It wasn't an emergency fix. How can prices vary so widely? Unbelievable. I guess OK in an emergency, but a grand more for a valve replacement? Are these industries regulated on prices? Seems like a free for all in the trades as far as prices. Just unreal.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFQWBbpllEZ5gK9J12oIMZxM4vQVSLfUrHsJ8n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJRsFMk_BmHD0BIgHplMVKn4zNAy3TvJT3KVIG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1580765254395, 'text': 'Thank you mbez110 for taking the time to describe your experience and for bringing your dissatisfaction to our attention.

Highly recommend Anderson for their excellent service, professionalism, and extremely competitive pricing. The repair tech was  here right on time, explained the situation completely, offered a few maintenance suggestions and put everything back in place when he was done. Will definitely use their services if/when the need arises.<//review>

We had Rudy out to give us a second quote for drain repair and value replacement. He was fast efficient and honest. The qoute we had from the other guys was double the price and work. Anderson plumbing is the only company I trust for a fair honest price.<//Text>

Re pipe of the gas system in my mobile home.
Drew, the technician did a great job replacing my old gas piping, risers and shutoffs.

The furnace, water heater are performing well.

The stove is not working at this time. I’m not sure what happened there?

Thank You Drew!< /review>

We've used Anderson's before with good results.  This time they sent a self-professed "drain" guy to install a new kitchen faucet on a Friday.  On Saturday, we discovered a large leak under the sink.  I called customer service and the first answer was "we like to have the responsible installer do the repair, is that alright?"  Uh, no, what part of large leak don't you understand?  Turned out the earliest they could get anyone out was Monday!  All weekend appointments were "booked".  As a VIP member I expected better service than this when the leak was caused by their installer.
The gentleman who came on Monday initially intended to charge me for the visit, but backed off when I explained (again) who had caused the issue.  He was competent and knowledgeable and fixed the problem to our satisfaction, but I still contend that I shouldn't have had to spend the weekend with a leak that was caused by their employee.  And next time, if there is a next time, please don't send a DRAIN guy to do a PLUMBER'S job. I also told the dispatcher to have a Supervisor call me on Monday to discuss (no supervisor available on weekend).  That never happened.  This is not what I call VIP service.

Edited based on the prompt response I received from Erin in CS. She took responsibility,  both personally and as a company, for the issues I identified and resolved the situation to my satisfaction.</Text>

I wanted to do an update on my 5 star review. Change it to 1 star as I was charged 202 bucks to relight my water heater. I figured it was standard for the business but was shocked to learn was way overcharged. I was not present at the time. My girlfriend was and she definitely was taken advantage of. She was just happy to have hot water. Then I was given an estimate to replace a 2 year old water heater and they wanted 3300 bucks. You can get water heater for about 650 to 750 at home depot and get it installed for 200 bucks. This company really does wow with sticker price. Shocking. They did say they would apply the 202 towards install. Wow. Definitely do your research.<//review>

We have preferred service for the tankless water heater and scheduled for service today. Service technician arrive 3 1/2 hours after agreed upon time.
The water pressure was checked and read 150 psi which is above the serviceable psi of 50(?). Technician quoted a price of $745!! To replace a regulator that cost less than $100?!  There is an adjustment screw that reduces the psi and could have been done or at least recommended versus a $745 replacement. Extremely poor customer service after waiting for hours for technician to arrive. Not a pleased customer whatsoever. There motto of making you smile is not today rather the opposite.<//Review>

Very prompt and courteous but the estimate was crazy high.  Paid $42 for estimate that could have been given over phone and saved us both time.  All we needed was a new toilet installed. The toilet  was already purchased and probably would have taken 30 minutes to install.  The estimate was over $700.00!!<//Text>

<text>“I’m going to wow you with 5 star service”. Unfortunately that didn’t happen.  Didn’t even come close.  My plumber was having a bad day and instead of making the matters better he had excuses and didn’t want to do the job.  Was easily frustrated and definitely wish another person was called out.  I always use Bill Howe but in need of a plumber emergency we gave Anderson a call.  That was a mistake. They had a chance to “steal” my business from them and they did the opposite on that night.</text></record></dataset><record>

Working with Anderson Plumbing was great. They were very nice and courteous on the phone. They sent me text message updates keeping me updated about my plumber's schedule. While here, the plumber was respectful, and he talked me through his entire process to keep me informed. I will absolutely go back to them for future needs.</Text>

<text>The service was great! Plumber knew what he was talking about. He had to deal with the city water management and made sure they came in a timely manner to resolve an issue. The plumber had patience and was well organized. The repairs looked great and working well! He kept areas nice and clean. Definitely will be using them again!!< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Great service. Fernando and his helper were very professional. Quality and fast install of new water heater. They also installed a water regulator for the irrigation system.

I would have given 5 stars - except the price was very high in comparison. Especially that we plumbed the whole house with copper before. Anderson did the work ...<//Review>

Enrique and crew installed my new heater and air conditioning system. A very, very professional installation. They were very professional and very attention to detail driven. This is the second major job I've had for Anderson, the first being my tankless water heater installation a year ago. This is my go-to group for any of the quality of life utilities that I need for my homes.</Text>

You can always count on Anderson PHA to do the job correctly the first time. Our technician, Dave, performed the annual inspection and servicing of our recently installed furnace. At the end, he provided a detailed report of the tests and measurements he performed. He took the extra time to answer all of my questions and even repaired a leak on the hot water vent on my roof. Just like all other Anderson employees, Dave left the area cleaner than he found it. I joined the Anderson VIP program and found it to be financially beneficial in keeping my furnace, hot water heater, and plumbing in good working order.< /text>

While the initial inspection went great and was conducted in a professional manner, the quote received for a new heat pump and air handler were among the highest we saw from any vendor.

However, the rating given takes into account Anderson's incessant marketing emails that I swear I've unsubscribed from multiple times and still receive. Marking them as spam hasn't worked either for some reason.< /Text>

<Review>Repaired Shower Faucet.
I was led to believe it would be a more extensive job to replace a standard Moen valve (with a plastic handle)."Once I open up the wall it could take a while(paraphrasing)." Over $500 and 30minutes later he was out the door. Appalled, I dug a little deeper. Apparently, it's a very common valve and easy to fix, based on results. Of course, I called to complain several times and never received a callback. I did receive an email stating their policy and they would extend courtesy with a $126 discount. So the result is 1 valve $50 and 30 minute labor $324.  ***Buyer Beware<//Review>< rate>

<review>Overall, the service was good. The only discrepancies were that the Free HVAC Sanitizing Service mentioned on the mailer reminding me that it’s time for your VIP HVAC TUNE UP did not specify that I had to mention that I wanted the free sanitizing service in order to get it done with the tune up. Now I have to schedule another appointment to get the Sanitizing Service. It would of been a lot more convenient to get it done in one appointment. Last, the technicians used my garden hose and got it all muddy. It would of been nice if they could of swept the mud off the hose!< /review>< pics>

We reached out to many plumbing companies but Anderson had the best price. The technician Drew was amazing and patient with us. He came masked up and listened to all our concerns. Drew replaced our tankless hot water heater within 4hrs. Drew was polite, friendly and quick. They even gave us a military discount.

Thank you Anderson for sending Drew Grant! Yayyyy! We have hot water again. 😊

<Text>While "Katy" was very professional in her demeanor and seems highly versed in the technical aspects of my furnace, I was surprised by the lack of specificity in the diagnoses. It could be this, this or this.  Which leads me to question, do service tech earn commission on repairs? In other words, the more parts and labor they sell, the bigger their paycheck?

Is this ethical?  Sadly, I ran into this same issue about a year or two ago with Anderson and my AC condenser. The repair estimate was $6K.  I ended up fixing it myself for $200 and it's worked perfectly ever since.

Today’s repair estimate  $1,788 + $68 for the service call. The parts, which I found online, are less than $285, and I question if they are both necessary. Labor time to replace these two suggested parts, or three suggested parts is 45 minutes for an experienced tech,  double for a novice.

With this second instance of what I believe are questionable at best business practices, and more likely unethical ones, obviously supported by management I will not use your company for any service or future sales.

UPDATE - March 2021
Apparently my review struck a nerve. Received a call and a full refund of my $68 service call fee. I still feel it’s a buyer beware situation, but I acknowledge the company did the right thing when they were called out.<//Text>< pics>

All of my interactions with Anderson were phenomenal from calling the main line to meeting the technicians. We had a surprise leak that turned into bigger issues at every turn due to water damage- they assisted during each step and even were able to coordinate with the restoration company to help us get things fixed. James & Drew were amazing technicians- both friendly, on-time and knowledgeable. I appreciate all the advice, hard work and communication. Thanks, Anderson!</text>

{'time': 1613773677015, 'text': 'Thank you Garrett for your review and bringing to our attention your dissatisfaction with your service. After reviewing your  services, I found that our first technician did waive the fee at the time of service. And on the second call, our drain camera specialist found nothing to be wrong with your drains, removing only clogged hair. There were no repairs to be made or suggested, as the home and drains are under 1 year old and in working order. This service call also was performed at no charge to you. We apologize that you were not satisfied with our service, we do not have any record of you trying to contact us  to discuss your experience. We do take all concerns seriously and if you would like to discuss further or have a field manger out- please contact Erin, our Client Relations Manager to schedule. She can be reached at 619-449-3852 x445.  Thank you, Anderson PHA'}<//Response>
<Text>Despite my reluctance to deal with a huge plumbing service, I requested a plumber from Anderson to come out and evaluate why my bathroom sink drain continues to clog only 1-2 months after having it cleaned out. I was clear when booking the appointment that I did not want an 'unclog' service but for an actual plumber to come assess my issue.

Afternoon appointments are supposed to be from 12-4pm but the technician did not arrive until 5pm. When she arrived I explained what I was looking to do, just as I had explained it to the dispatcher. I proceeded to show her the issue and she removed the drawers from my bathroom sink in order to look at the plumbing.

After looking at the plumbing she indicated that she could clear the clog but it would happen again due to the drain. I explained that the purpose of the service call was to evaluate and take the steps needed to permanently resolve the issue and I was happy to replace all plumbing if needed to resolve this issue.

She continued to recommend that I have her fix the issue so the drain flows for ~$150, and have someone else come look at the drain with a camera. When I explained that I didn't want to spend $150 on a temporary fix when I was going to pay to replace the plumbing, the technician gave me attitude and left without reinstalling the drawers into my sink cabinet.

It has been difficult to get ahold of anyone at Anderson to resolve the issue. I have requested my money back and will use a different plumber to complete my project.</Text><rate>1< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Took tech about 10 minutes start to finish. Cost $291 and they did not connect to my router. Unable to use feature on smart thermostat. I guess i did get wowwed! Price versus what was actually done. I emailed Anderson Plumbing and i will wait to hear back. I wonder how much it would cost to have the thermostat to work as a smart device. WOW

We had Anderson come out and do a complimentary cleaning on our furnace. We were told we needed thousands of dollars in cleaning, repair, and upgrades to bring it up to code. We had a second opinion without mentioning any of the issues brought up by Anderson from another reputable company. They only quoted us one part to bring the unit up to code and it was a fraction of the price. We won’t be using Anderson again because of the prices and unnecessary services offered each time.<//Text>

Bernard replaced wall heater thermostat. Before entering our residence he put on booties over his shoes. Comprehensive  check of wall heater.  Discussed the Lifespan of heater and the importance of CO detectors. Added a little chemistry lesson. Gas is lighter than oxygen so the detector needs to be mounted high.</Text>

Awesome first time experience using Anderson Plumbing! Both techs Jesse S. and Peter V. Were the absolute, consummate professionals.  I truly appreciated their workmanship and knowledge.  My thing is when you're refinished with the job and you leave it cleaner than what it was when you started, that speaks volumes for the company they represent! Thats why I'll be a returning customer!... and i just happen to be doing some remodeling hmmmm.<//review>

<Text>I was so impressed by the level of professionalism and courtesy.  They were able to come out in 12hrs for no rush charge, they called a half hour before arrival, sent me a text as well with a small bio on the technician in advance.  Extremely courtesy technician wore shoes covers and a mask the whole time but I had no problems understanding him as he spoke very clearly.  We had a pleasant chat as he worked and I learned that they will send the same technician out to the same house next time so you get to know them.  He seemed so happy with his job it was spoke well for the way they must treat their employees.  He took the time to look at another pipe I was told I needed to replace by a house inspector.  He went under the house and is having the office contact me to schedule an installer to come give me a quote.  But the whole appointment was quite fast!  Most pleasant experience with a plumber ever.< /Text><rating>5</rating>< Pictures>

We discovered 2in. Of water on the garage floor. Called Anderson at night and the tech helped us shut everything down over the phone. Jamar came the next day, explained what needed to be done and got to work. I chose the sticker shock option because I knew it would be 100% trustable and quality.

I have used Andersen Heating and Air for 8 years. They took out an old gas wall heater, dry walled to perfection and painted the area; they installed & have maintenanced the mini split ductless units, they have installed a new water heater, a new garbage disposal, cleared a slow drain. Their service is top notch, and the technicians are competent, friendly, and leave the place clean. I highly recommend.</Review>

<review>Wonderful from start to finish! The company called 30mins before to let me know when they would arrive! They also texted a picture of the man coming to fix my shower! When he arrived he had a clean mask on an put booties over his shoes as he walked into my house! He was good with my dogs. He did a very good inspection of my shower wall and found the leek behind the broken handle! He gave me options on fixing it with different prices so I could make the best decision!! Super professional and I will use them again!<//review>< pics>

<Review>Scott is a great technician.  He explained the entire water heater flush process. He also checked our faucets and drains throughout the house.  He made a couple of recommendations of things we could consider for lasting value of our existing fixtures.  Professional and friendly service.</Review>< pictures>

Eduardo and Jake were excellent!!  It was emergency call and they arrived same day as promised.  They took care of the perceived water leak underneath the mobile home.  Identified what was going on and supplied photos on the status of all the piping.  Much appreciated and both gentlemen were ver professional!</Text>

Anderson P&H provided the annual (and free) inspection and maintenance on the Lennox Mini-Split AC that I had installed a few years ago by then.  Brian was extremely courteous, on-time, and competent during this service call.  As is usual with Anderson, I am very happy with the service.< /text>

Replaced a leaking faucet outdoors and replaced my worn out bathtub and shower fixtures. Mike, from Anderson Plumbing did an excellent job. He inspected the problem, explained the repair (and why he chose that option), showed me the progress through the repair so I could see what was behind the walls, flushed the lines, ensured I was OK with the finished product, and cleaned up as if he were never there. I am very satisfied with Mike and the entire Anderson’s team from initial call to completion. I will use them for all my plumbing and HVAC needs. I would recommend Anderson’s Heating and Plumbing.<//review>

<Text>I received a call from Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air to advise me that I was due for my annual, no cost, service on my two heaters that Anderson had installed 4 years prior.  They indicated they had a technician that could perform the service the following day.

The HVAC Maintenance Technician, Haley Wegman, called the following day to say she'd be arriving within the half hour.  She was on time--we're off to a good start.

She inspected both of our heaters and provided an easy to follow assessment of what she'd found and done.  Haley was very professional, reassuring and a pleasure to work with.  Anderson has done an excellent job with recognizing the unique talents that military vets, like Haley, possess.  If I were to rate my satisfaction with Anderson and Haley on a 10 point scale, they would receive an 11.<//Text>< pics>

Micheal was very nice and checked all areas for a leak. He didn’t locate the leak in my toilet and referred me to advanced detection who found the toilet valve was leaking. I think Anderson should have found and repaired the leak before I had to pay $240 to have the tank cover lifted to reveal the slow leak. Now I have to pay for another visit by Anderson to make the repairs. This is an expensive mistake by Anderson</review>

We are so appreciative of Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air! We had a leak within our wall/ceiling. I called and Mike arrived within the hour. Our plumbing issue was complicated and it took Mike two full days to fix it, but he was dogged his problem-solving. When you're in this type of situation, it's a little overwhelming and it was a relief to have engaged with such a responsive, reliable, professional company.</text>

Wanted 2800 for a 40 gallon Bradford white.  Ridiculous price.  Should cost between 1200 and 1800 for parts and labor depending on the situation.  They hope the home owner doesnt know what a basic water heater should cost.   Unreal.  Should be a crime.  Dont waste your money.< /Review>

<text>As part of Anderson’s comprehensive home maintenance program, I was delighted to have them call and schedule a checkup of my water heater. This is part of their service after the sale that helps to set Anderson apart from the others.
The technician came by on schedule and Preventively serviced my water Heater and explained how to help it last as long as possible.  Offered No pressure to make any Upgrades but gave me options to consider if we wanted to improve our water quality.
I think I made an excellent decision to go with Anderson when we installed our AC system. I’m confident they will take care of us for years to come.<//text>< pics>

I Just wanted to let you know that the service technician you sent,  Michael Gaskill, did an excellent job for me on my A/C system. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable and diagnosed and got the deferred maintenance and repairs accomplished all in one appointment. He even spotted and corrected some prior installation defects from the original installer and cleaned my permanent air filter in the unit for me! I would not hesitate to have Michael perform heating and cooling repairs for me at my home in the future.

Mario and Blake (supervisor)  installed a new Trane Furnace in my home. They were on time, had the correct tools and completed the installation an hour earlier than estimated. They both were personable young men who clearly demonstrated technical skill and knowledge

I've been an Anderson Heating and Air customer for over 15 years. The quality of the installation and inspection work performed during their visits left no doubt in my mind that my family would be safe when operating the systems!<//Review>

<Text>We have had Jose come out to our house twice and he is really friendly, professional, and informative. I love that Anderson Plumbing is do prompt and reasonably priced, and they give a 90 day warranty on clogs, they also will send a camera down your drain for free. I've dealt with other companies that charge $100 for that. I won't use anymore else.</Text>< user_id>

<username>Samantha Corbin</username><time>1616170769089</time><rating>5<//rating><Review>I wish I could give Jacob and Humberto 10 stars instead of five!  I had a gigantic hot water leak in the slab of my home and called Anderson Plumbing to check it out.  After hearing a wide range of repair options and learning about the benefits of repiping the water system through the attic (no future slab leaks and no tearing up the floor!), I decide to go for the whole home repipe.  Jacob and Humberto started work the next morning and completed the pipe fitting within three days.  I was blown away by the quality, speed, accuracy and cleanliness of their work.  They communicated well with me, each other, and their main office so there were zero hiccups.  A huge bonus was that we had running, cold water and at least one restroom available at all times, until the last three hours when the system changed from old pipes to new.  A VERY well ran project and professional company from start to finish!  Please don’t hesitate to call Anderson...or have your home repiped by them!<//Review>< pics>

<review>I had a water leak emergency in my house, and I am so grateful that Anderson Plumbing was able to fit me in, and very quickly, too.  The first two plumbing companies I called said they were booked solid, and wouldn't even try to help.  Anderson did a fast, courteous job and even gave me the senior discount!  What a lifesaver they were!<//review></record>

Anderson Plumbing helped us with a last minute issue. In having our floors replaced we needed a plumber to check for leaks as our concrete subfloors had some moisture on them. We got very quick appointment with Anderson Plumbing and Joshua showed up the next morning, early and checked everything for us thoroughly. It was quite a relief to have someone come out with such short notice and still be very thorough and not cut any corners! Thank you guys so much!</text>

<Text>First time customer and will use again.  Always saw their commercials and received flyer on specials (yes, they work).  Had a leak in kitchen clean out and James came out same day.  He explained the problem, gave me options and then proceeded to work.  About 20 mins later work was done and price was reasonable.  Wonder why I waited so long?  Next time will call them first!</Text>< gmap_id>

<review>First off, our technician that showed Josue was not only the most professional, but also timely plumber I’ve used in a while. He was incredibly courteous and mindful of our very expensive tile throughout the bathroom where he had to unclog a drain.

I can’t speak so much about the company as I’d like to comment on how amazing our technician Josue was. If we could give six stars we would, Andersen is fortunate to have someone like this on their team.<//review>< Response>

<Review>Update:
Erin, Anderson's Client Relations Manager reached out via email and explained their policy of flat rate per type of the job.  She offered 15% off on the water pressure regulator job and removed the charge for accessing the valve. While I recognize the effort to provide good customer care (along with multiple text, email and phone call asking for feedback)  I cannot say I'm remotely happy about this flat rate charge that's 3-4 time higher than being reasonable.

===========================================================
Anderson Plumbing's charge is absurdly high! I had a technician come to fix a leaky waterline going into the fridge. while doing that he also found the water pressure was high and I agreed to have the water pressure regulator replaced.

He had to cut a small hole on the drywall to access the pipe, which took him 30 seconds, and the charge is $323. Note this is only for cutting the hole, not including any repair work, and they will not fix the drywall afterwards. The actual repair work of replacing the water supply line's connection valve is another $323, which I'm ok with, since at least the technician spent 30 minutes on it.

The most ridiculous one is the $1,485 charge for replacing the water pressure regulator. The part is $180 according to the technician, and it's a quick job taking him literally less than 10 minutes using only a plumbers plier. I found out afterwards a reasonable cost for this should be in the $300 range including the part, and feel quite bad not doing enough research and being an informed customer beforehand. I wish everyone else considering calling them have the chance to read the reviews beforehand and be aware of their practice of overcharging to an outrageous extent.

I do agree that it was easy for me to make the appointment, and the technician came on time and finished the job quickly in a professional manner. But I'd not be able to recommend their services to anyone due to the extremely unreasonably high cost.< /Review>< pics>

Both technicians Ismael and Peter were very professional on time very informative very courteous and very knowledgeable of the job I would highly recommend both of them and I had a choice between three plumbing and heating companies and I thought I had already made my first choice but after I met with Debbie who also was very informative and professional.i was so impressed i decided to go with Anderson heating and plumbing to install a New Heater and A/C unit.  It was the BEST CHOICE!!< /Text>

I was really wowed , Ken was so kind, helpful, professional, informative. Knowledgeable and went above and beyond to fix and repair,
He repaired a shower diverter that the original contractor i hired messed up. He was so respectful and didn't wanna step in the shower to keep it clean
Then I asked to replace a kitchen faucet so he took care of it although he had to cut the rusty part and also fixed all the plumbing mistakes originally was made by some bad plumer, that  eventually ended in my dishwasher working again after I was about to buy a new one.
I can't say enough about Ken, he cared about my house like its his<//Review>

I called to avail their promotion for mini split tune up. Joe was the technician who came to perform the job. He did a thorough inspection of my unit to make sure my filters are clean, the coils are producing much needed cold air, pressure is ok. Keep up the excellent job Joe. He is also very respectful and friendly.< /Text>

Aug 28  rPlumber was great, gave estimate $300+ to pull toilet. Did the work and found a broken flange which he didn't have.Would reschedule for Sat 29..... Sat 29 someone  calls in sick, will schedule Monday fine with us. ...Mon 31 a tech arrives but says he is her to do a complementary  camera inspection of our system.Never said specifically he was their to finish the job....estimate now $660+. We send him off they will reschedule us now for tues Sept 1 Agent for Andersen call us on the phone agent is finally on the way estimate ..$1,500 to finish seating our toilet had her repeat it so my wife could hear $1,500! My wife is handicapped with Parkinsons so the toilet is essential .So after 5days after pulling the toilet and the estimate doubling every time. We definitely felt we were getting burned.The job is not done  we are going elsewhere!</text>

We had an old water heater that started leaking.  Anderson was able to come first thing the next day to give a free estimate.  We had several companies come out and provide us quotes to replace it with a gas tankless water heater.   Anderson came in at a reasonable price but the technician, Drew (Andrew), included additional incentives that persuaded us to go with them.  Drew had everything with him and was able to get us the appropriate water heater that same day.  He relocated and installed the water heater outside of our garage by the end of the day.   We were impressed by how efficient and clean he was with his work.  We had previous copper plumbing done in our home before and Drew was impressively quicker than the other guys.  He had to come back another day to finish up other work to our house but was equally as efficient and clean with his work.  He also set us up to have our drains scoped for free.  The technician, Brent, came out to scope our drains and was equally efficient, timely, and customer friendly.  I would highly recommend Anderson, Drew, and Brent for future plumbing/heating projects.</text>

Octavio was awesome! Very professional and helpful, even giving me tips on how to never see him again for a clogged drain! My only snag is that they reel you in with the $53 unclog deal but it really only applies in very limited circumstances. I ended up paying $141 to get my clogged drain running.< /text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Worst ever customer service and plumbing knowledge. We called them for detecting a leak which had resulted in the floor flooding. The plumber came visited the house and charged us for the visit. The plumber had no clue, he could not detect the source and wrongly advised that the leak was coming from the bathroom upstairs. They charged us $365 for nothing and never send us a report. After multiple follow ups still till date no report has been given. We ended up calling another plumber who very quickly detected the leaking dishwasher at almost $100 cheaper. He also help fixed the leak and helped us with drying company and dishwasher company.

I would never use Andersen Plumbing ever again and advise everyone to stay away from them.

Subsequent to this review I had a very good follow up from Andersen and they have since rectified their response and have successfully resolved the matter to my satisfaction.

Thank you Andersen for prompt followup.</text>< pics>

Tech seemed very knowledgeable and walked me through his process. At the end there was a pitch for a service maintenance contract and a $12K replacement of my entire HVAC system. Both of which as asked for them to send as a quote and didn’t want to commit upfront.

The tech had booties but walked to and from his truck with them on so not sure they helped much. My wife needed to ask the tech to put on a new mask since his wasn’t covering his alface completely- he was nice enough to comply.

Overall positive experience with a few minor bumps.< /review>< pictures>

<gmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</gmapID><Name>James Maddalena<//Name><Review>Used To service my heater. Tech seemed very knowledgeable and walked me through his process. At the end there was a pitch for a service maintenance contract and a $12K replacement of my entire HVAC system. Both of which as asked for them to send as a quote and didn’t want to commit upfront.

The tech had booties but walked to and from his truck with them on so not sure they helped much. My wife needed to ask the tech to put on a new mask since his wasn’t covering his alface completely- he was nice enough to comply.

Overall positive experience with a few minor bumps.<//Review></record>

Terrible.  Had a guy out on July 6 to look at our shower faucet/fixture for repair.  He disassembled and took the parts to try and find new ones, saying he would be in touch in a couple of days.  Crickets.

We called 3 times and were told the technician would get back with us soon.  More crickets.

Called again and were told that technician had a "family emergency" and would be in touch when he returned.  More crickets.

Called today, July 31, and was told the technician quit.  He still has our fixture, which I can not now repair as they are an uncommon brand and hard to find.  We have not been able to use the bathroom shower/tub for almost a month.  The manager is "going to look into it" and was supposed to call me today or tomorrow.

Unbelievably unprofessional for the "nobody wows clients like we do" company.<//review>

<Review>I've never used Anderson Plumbing until yesterday. My technician Josh was a plumbing maestro. I had a hard to find leak in an older home and he was able to determine exactly where it was and how to fix it in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately, he had to use a jackhammer but I feel very confident his work was done expertly and I will not have any more issues. Moreover, he was professional, present and respectful.</Review>< user>

Had a leak on my hot water valve under my bathroom sink. The valves were super old and I tried to close the valve which caused the issue. Andrew with Anderson Plumbing showed up within 20 minutes. He replaced both hot and cold valves and was out the door within another 20 minutes. He was very professional through the entire process. I will definitely be calling him back for any more plumbing needs.</Review>

I was quoted to replace a 40 gallon water heater at 3990. Of course this must have included a waterless system which I wasn't given both options. My wife had to meet them being I got held up and I'm starting to think maybe a little hoodwink was in place when wifey opened the door cause do the math. 40 gallon brand-new water heater is no more than 600 home depot, search online and find an installer for 200 to 250 tops, now we at 850 and this is a high 850, it could be at least minus 200 from that depending on thriftiness in ones blood. However, of course the water damage was way to extensive for Anderson plumbing so they needed another company one they suggested to come dry out sheet rock in the garage, hehehe. Not sheetrock in the breathing area within the home but off in the garage that was hardly bad, my house fan could dry it up in 5 hours . However, to get all done we were looking at 4000 to 5000. Oh us military have a whopping 3 percent discount , ooohhhh. Just keep that 3 percent and invest into a little moral dignity and remember what it was like when you started out Mrs Andersen, not everyone has la jolla strip mall money, and to be women owned part of a special population you would think they wouldn't try to get over on a wife filling in for husband or 3 percent might actually go to 10 percent for another special population in military and that 5000 is 2 military paychecks just to get water hot, hell I could rent two recruits from mcrd to sit and blow their hot breath on the tank and it be more morally inline than 5000 dollars for 40 gallons of water but wait they were trying to upgrade our whole system cause they must have insider scoop my housing area is turning into a strip mall where 5000 seems bout right when it also has a 24hr fitness inside the mall, ridiculous, .I just paid 75 for a water heater and 250 to install from facebook marketplace, Anderson you ought to be ashamed of the robbery you just attempted .

<Text>Have used them before on a clogged sink drain, this time it was the toilet. They give you plenty of time to be ready before a technician arrives. My technician Chris made quick work of the issue and was very professional the entire visit. I will choose Anderson again any time when faced with plumbing related issues.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Anderson plumbing heating & Air - came to service my AC - but arrived without a new filter
They installed the entire furnace and AC unit -
In Covid times - it would be nice to be prepared with essential items to avoid entering homes unnecessarily- now they’ll need to come back
Again - Just a waste of their time & mine
The filter was in serious need of replacement..</review>

The slogan ‘How can we make your day a little better’ is exactly what u receive.
My heater was wintered checked at no charge, & the service rep Jeff was true to the 5 star service the company represents. Jeff was courteous, friendly, an expert in his field & walked me through the services he was providing, explaining all facets. As a senior citizen I truly appreciated his time & patience with any questions I had.
Thank you Anderson Plumbing, your techs r the best!!!</Review>

Appointments are easy to make and the technicians are professional as well as congenial.  Aldo just serviced our AC.  We bought it from Anderson one year ago.  Aldo was very tolerant of our questions throughout his visit.  He also suggested items to enhance the performance of our AC.  He knew his stuff!<//Review>< pics>

Bernard, Eugene, and Morgan are talented plumbers, knowledgeable, trustworthy, and efficient.  They are very fair in what needs to be fixed, promptly diagnosed the problems with a great at explaining exactly what needs to be done as they proceeded.  Everything was well done by the team and no dirt was left behind.  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the company to my families and friends<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Anderson is overpriced manipulated company.  The technician opened up my sealed ac unit even though I specifically said my AC is fine.  I was fortunated done a lot homework and went with airmaxx.  They were abel to fix my AC blower fan capacitor via Anderson pushed me into replace my whole heating system for $6300+.  Please stay away from them.

Just to update.  My AC was ended fixed for $237.  One honest mechanics replaced capacitor and that's it.  Anderson teared my AC and heater all apart.  It would cost even less.</Text>< name>

< Review>
They sent workers out right away. Very impressed with their knowledge & “yes” to getting my pipes fixed same day. They also referred an excellent contractor for drying spaces & repairing drywall damage(Apex). A final call to see if I was satisfied was a plus in customer satisfaction. I would definitely call them first.</Review>

<review>Aldo Lopez, HVAC tech from Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air came to do a routine check-up/maintenance on our Air Conditioning unit today. Aldo was polite, wore protective gear and practiced good social distancing. He fine tuned our unit, topped off the refrigerant and changed the filter and anything else that was needed. Even though it was raining and muddy, he didn't make a mess. He did give me a couple of recommendations for the future life of our A/C. I would like to have Aldo perform any future HVAC repairs.

We have been using Anderson Plumbing, Heat and Air fir several years, and have never been disappointed.< /review>< gmap_id>

I requested toilet repair service.  I was shocked at the very, very high price for the service that took less than one hour to fix.  I will use a different plumbing repair service next time as this company is too expensive for a  senior person.<//Text>

We were contacted by Anderson to let us know that our technician would be arriving shortly.  Johnny was on time. He listened to our concerns and answered our questions thoroughly.  He showed us a feature of our system that would have it run more efficiently and would save money on the power bill.
Johnny conducted our servicing quickly and shared the results with us.
He was friendly, knowledgeable, and professional.  He is a great ambassador for the company.</text>

<Review>I have had an outstanding  experience having Anderson's plumbing do my central  air conditioning.
The men, Jason, Mario, Peter and electrician, Christian were hard working, respectful group of workers!  Jason was an excellent supervisor. They cleaned up and left my house better than when they came.
I couldn't have asked for a less stressful  project in my home.  JOB WELL DONE!!

I've had other plumbers do work for me in the past but none compare to James from Walter Anderson Plumbing . He was outstanding at cleaning out our backed up drain clog. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and went out of his way to not make a mess and informed me about everything he was doing and about W. A.'s policies. I highly recommend Walter Anderson if all of their employees are anything like James.
I recommend that you look for "Specials" on their website to save a few $$.
Thanks James and Walter Anderson.<//Text>

Our tech Mr Johnny came to our home on time to perform our yearly VIP check up on our thoroughly happy unit we purchased 2 years ago. He gave us recommended ideas on how to better improve our use and up keep in maintaining our flow of air to last forever. At this time we chose not to purchase more filters but we may do this online at a later time. He has come to our home 2 times and i hope he can come again when we do our next system check up.  Mr Johnny still knows how to give customer service and we really appreciate it. Thank you!< /review>

Michael, the technician came in and was so friendly. Knowledgeable on what he is doing and very professional, he explained to me what was going on with my furnace. He recommended things that I should do to keep my furnace, air conditioning, and plumbing up and working.

The only thing that I wish was lower was the price of the parts and service that was changed and charged. But other than that, the service was excellent.</text>

After our plumbing backed up into the house, we called Anderson’s to help. The technician was very friendly and kept me up-to-date on the arrival time. When I explained the issue, James was very knowledgeable and knew exactly where the issue was. It was simple and easy for us, he took care of everything. A fair price and quality service—we will definitely use Anderson’s for future needs.</text>

<text>I am super satisfied with my drain clearing service with Anderson plumbing. I liked that they call before heading over, and the plumber that came answered all the questions I had. He also cleared my drain very quickly and told me about what he found in there. I am happy I was able to use a $53 coupon for the service, and I will call them again if I need a plumber. Would recommend.<//text>< Pics>

<review>So I am usually not one to write reviews …. but I just had a great experience with Anderson and their pro plumber Ron Miller so here I go.
On the road while my wife deals with a plumbing fiasco long brewing under the sink.  I get home and dial for help.  They said most likely a night call, I was fine with that.  One day turnaround great by me.   Instead, they call back in an hour or so and someone is free now … yea!  Plumber Ron Miller is highly recommended by me.  He is our plumber now..  A pro , not a kid (sorry kids) he has experience and fixed us up, plus another issue I surprised him with.  No problem.   Thanks Anderson and especially Ron!  Highest recommendation from a tough old guy who can't fix anything by himself!< /review><Resp>{'time': 1527894909488, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, Greg!

<Time>1540607283995< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I had issues with my heating, plumbing and air conditioning all on the same day. The representative that answered the phone when I called made sure I had an immediate appointment the next day and I was kept apprised of when the technician(s) would be arriving and also whether there was an earlier slot available so that I wouldn't have to wait.

All 3 of the technicians arrived on time and made me feel comfortable that they would resolve the problem.

Donald and Reggie, who handled the plumbing did a wonderful job! They explained everything to me and had me watch as they were doing the work. I have additional work to be done and they gave me options so that I could choose the most cost effective solution for my home and made an appointment to finish the work as soon as possible. Both were very competent, professional and personable and managed to resolve my issue, which gave me peace of mind.

The same was true for Mike, who handled my heating and air conditioning issues. He took the time to thoroughly diagnose and troubleshoot the problems and to make sure I was satisfied with his work before I left. I felt the pricing was reasonable given the fact that the work was warrantied by the company directly and none of them tried to pressure me into choosing a more expensive option. Reggie explained the rationale behind why it would be better to spend a little extra when it came to replacing two of the faucets in my bathroom.

All 3 left their contact info with me so I could reach them if there were any further problems and assured me that the company warranted their  work. They all also talked to me about the company's current promotions but didn't push me into going for any of them.

I had a very positive experience with Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air and I would definitely work with this company again!<//Text>< Pics>

<review>They never ask if we think it is a slab leak or outside of the home. They do not do anything for a leak outside a home and refer a company with no major web presence (business website or social media account). Offers to replace a sighted leaking valve for several hundred instead of a simple fix of torquing the gland nut.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Johnny Castro made a courtesy call to fix wiring that was left exposed by an electrician from another company. He did a great job of addressing that and making an eyesore look professionally covered. He upgraded the batteries in the outside unit for the wireless thermostat, and did a thorough visual inspection of the furnace in our attic. Lastly, he gave me a quick overview of how our new wireless thermostat works. This is the third time he has been here, and he is always professional, courteous, & taking the time to listen & explain things. He is an excellent representative of Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air!

Amazing service, our technician Andy was the best most respectful person we’ve had in our home. The other company who was at our house yesterday was out for a buck, but Andy took time to explain what was going on, was conservative with a treatment plan and went above and beyond what was required of him. As a small business owner, I understand the power of a good experience, and I will be telling EVERY SINGLE PERSON, business owner, friend and acquaintance about how wonderful of a company Anderson is. I am truly blown away by the service. Andy needs a raise, bonus and vacation. He is a gem you have working for you. A true gentleman and an honest tradesperson—qualities that are as rare as a diamond.< /Text>

I just wanted to leave a review of the billing practices of Anderson Plumbing & Heating, that is the only portion of their work I find to be sub par.  We called them for a leaking toilet in a rental, they showed up at the appointed time and gave us the options of repairing or replacing.  We chose to replace and the work was completed on time and with what appears to be high quality.  My only complaint, the bill.  Parts and labor for an entirely new toilet was $518.98, reasonable.  The total bill was $1179, overhead & profit $660.02, which I think is too high.  They were contacted regarding the bill and they would not offer to cut any of the profit or overhead.< /text>

The two young men who came to work on my drains were very professional and did a quick job while still fixing the issues. James, who was so knowledgeable explained everything he did and what would need to be done in the future. I'm pleased to recommend Anderson's and to keep them as my family provider<//Review>

Plumbing problems are never good, but weekends seem to be when they happen to us.  We were concerned that we might have had to wait for hours for someone to come, but that wasn't the case.

James arrived in less than an hour after we called Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  He listened carefully when we described our situation, and promptly diagnosed the problem.  He got to work and in no time at all cleared the drain and everything was back to normal.

James took care to make sure no dirty water spilled anywhere and he described everything he was doing and why.  It was like getting a mini-plumbing lesson as a bonus.  He cares about his work and it shows.  He is simply the best.

We can't recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air enough.  When we had air conditioning work done previously, we joined their VIP program which we also recommend.< /text>

<name>Lisa Duffy< /name><Date>1541810879021< /Date><text>I began my search for a plumber to fix a blockage somewhere in the line by looking for a small, family-owned business to do the job.  I previously had a bad experience with a large company and didn't want to repeat that experience.  Although I found many wonderful plumbers to chose from at reasonable rates, everyone was busy and I was getting impatient.
My mom told me she used Anderson a few times with great results so I gave them a call.  Amazing service!  James was at my door within an hour or two, was polite, skilled and seemed to genuinely enjoy his work.  He spoke highly of his company and represented Anderson well.  Mine was not an easy job.  It required much troubleshooting and James was able to see it through with success!  With an online special they were running, I received and absolutely extraordinary deal.  Also received a nice warranty for the work.  I can't tell you how grateful I am.  Icing on the giant cake-Anderson donates a portion of proceeds to Susan G. Komen for breast cancer research on Fridays!  I am wowed! :)< /text>< Gmap_id>

Brian Blanchard and Justin B spent a very HOT, busy week rerouting our pipes through our attic due to a hot water leak in the cement slab in our La Mesa home. They were role models for what you WISH your plumber could be. They were very professional and involved US in the decision making needed to resolve our problems.  They treated us and our house with respect and consideration. EVERY evening they cleaned up the areas where they had worked diligently all day.  I cannot IMAGINE what the temperature was in our skinny attic!  They didn't just cut off at a respectable closing time, they worked well into the evening hours. They each have an incredible work ethic and take pride in a job well done.  They arrived on schedule and were personally neat and clean.  It is too bad you can't clone these men, because they treated us and our plumbing issues the way YOU would like to be treated.
Thank you for having the good sense to hire these two fine gentlemen.
Sincerely,
Dick and Sally Sweet</review>

<Review>I am very pleased to recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air. Everyone I have dealt with has been exceptional. The staff is very professional, efficient and friendly.  My first experience was with Justin who came to service my disposal. He did an excellent job and I was confident when I later scheduled to have him replace my water heater. Justin is very skilled and knowledgeable. He has a friendly manner and is able to explain all options and answer all questions thoroughly. Justin helped me to obtain the best deal and to use the credit I received from a previous service. When my water heater was installed Justin was assisted by Bethany who was also very professional and knowledgeable. I asked Bethany lots of questions, some of which I thought might be silly, but she patiently and knowledgeably answered each one. I felt very confident in her skills especially as I watched her performing her work. Both Justin and Bethany worked to make sure everything was done perfectly. I was very impressed with the quality of their work. I am very happy with my new disposal and water heater. I can relax knowing they were installed by technicians with exceptional skills using quality products. Thank you Justin and Bethany!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<time>1544503668661<//time><text>Eric Weismann at Anderson Plumbing is amazing!! My entire experience with Anderson Plumbing was perfect and their office staff is right on par with the way customer service is supposed to be. This is probably the only company I have experienced in San Diego who makes the customers concerns an actual priority. Before I contacted Anderson plumbing I had spent 3 weeks working with my home warranty to get someone out to look for a hard to find water leak. That company spent 2 days trying to find it and were very unprofessional. I kicked them out and called Anderson Plumbing. Within 3 hours of calling they had a technician (Eric) at my house! An hour later, Eric was able to tell me exactly where the leak was (under the slab in the garage) and walked me through the house to show me the route of all my water pipes. Eric with Anderson gave me a quote that was roughly $2000 less than the company my home warranty provided. That other Company ended up being off on the location of the leak by about 30 feet and wanted to jack hammer the slab in my bathroom. Thank God for Eric and Anderson Plumbing and their quality leak detection equipment and skill. If you want it done right you had better call Anderson Plumbing!< /text>< username>

They took care of a 25 year old HVAC unit to make it last for another 5 years which I had Anderson replace a few months ago when the old unit finally went out.  This past weekend I had my "VIP" plumbing inspection which was very detailed.  Dylan, my technician, was very thorough checking all of my plumbing including the hot water heater, water pressure valve and explained things as he went along.  A couple of days prior to my inspection my garbage disposal went out.  Dylan, reminded me that Anderson could do the work while he was there.  He took the time and had the new disposal readily available to install. Every technician I have had over the past 5 years are highly trained, qualified and professional.  Their office personnel is as well.  It is nice to have follow up after a service is performed and they do just that to make sure the customer is always satisfied.    I highly recommend Anderson for any of your plumbing, heating & air needs.<//review>< resp>

Donald was professional, intelligent and answered all my questions.  He was friendly, personable and honest.  He's truly an asset to your company and would be to any company he works for in the future.  I would like him to be my Maintenance Technician on a regular basis.  Because of Donald, I renewed by VIP membership for 2018.  Thanks for having such a capable man on the job.  It was truly refreshing.<//Review>

<Review>Called on 9-5-19 spoke to Tasha and she told me that there is a open window after 12pm but no guarantee. On 9-6-19 I told them I will be home after 330pm. Got home at 4pm and called and spoke with multiple people and every hour and was told I was next. Finally after 4+hrs I got a call and girl who called said that I was not on her list.

I called approximately 6 times and each I was told you will be next you will be next you're next in que the technician is on the way. We really felt let down again.

I stand by what I said above based on what we went through. But I am man enough to say that my man Johnny saved the night. This dude is top notch and really knows his "S"...super cool like the other side of the pillow👊. I wouldn't mine him lending his expertise in the near future. And too the dispatch supervisor thank you for your concern.</Review>< pictures>

Our technician Dylan was very knowledgeable and efficient. He got to work right away and got the job done. He gave us a detailed assessment at the end and answered our questions fully. The final bill was what I was quoted and what I felt was fair for the work. He added additional value by presenting us with coupons for discounts on Anderson services and recommended further work. I am completely satisfied and would happily recommend Dylan and Anderson.< /text>

I have had two remarkably excellent experiences with Anderson Plumbing. Both were large jobs requiring experience, knowledge, and skill to perform. I can report that both jobs were performed with professionalism and at a reasonable price. I am quite satisfied and recommend Anderson to anyone needing small or large plumbing problems resolved.

<text>Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air was responsive and professional. They fixed my AC system right before a record heat wave. Took him about 20 minutes. I will use them again with any future AC issues.<//text>< gmapID>

Ken, the service representative, was very knowledgeable and friendly. He clearly explained the various options for repairing/replacing our water heater so that we could make a informed decision. I was very happy with the work done by Anderson Plumbing.<//Text>

Katy and Ariel were thorough, professional and friendly. They explained what was going on with my furnace and a/c unit and how to read the diagnostics. They also provided guidance about things to look out for to determine if repairs are needed. The system is working like new!</Text>

<Review>I was out of town and my pet sitter let me know that the AC was out. I called Anderson plumbing and Heating and they were able to set up a service call the day I arrived home. With it being so hot I didn't think they would be able to come the day after I called. I was grateful that they were able to come service my unit and get us back up and running with cool air immediately.</Review>< pics>

I have had two remarkably excellent experiences with Anderson Plumbing. Both were large jobs requiring experience, knowledge, and skill to perform. I can report that both jobs were performed with professionalism and at a reasonable price. I am quite satisfied and recommend Anderson to anyone needing small or large plumbing problems resolved.

Ron Miller came to our house to assess and replace our leaking water heater.  He was on time , professional, and friendly.  He quickly removed the old water heater (under warranty) returned it with the replacement.  Ron installed the replacement and explained the operation.  He did an excellent job and I would highly recommend him.

<Text>I am very impressed by your responsiveness and communication.  Anderson had Michael come up quite soon after we called, sent a notice of his arrival with his picture (a great safety technique), and his work was clearly professional.  He knew what he was doing, was clear about the issues found, and well informed as to our options.

Very pleasant experience with Anderson Plubming! I had an issue with my dishwasher and they were able to send an expert pretty much right away! Dylan was very professional. He diagnosed the issue and explained to me what needed to be done. Then he and his associate fixed the dishwasher within 30 minutes of not less. I would certainly use them again if needed.</Text>

Erik went above and beyond what he was called out for. Couldn't have had a more informed representative from Anderson. Appreciated his honesty, his patient explanations and sound advice. Very friendly and respectful. He checked all around the house, tested water pressure, checked the water heater, and even crawled into our crawlspace to make sure we didn't have any leaks. He recommended a new water heater rather than flushing out the existing. (We have not flushed it in a very long time and the valve is plastic and the risk of cracking wasn't worth it.) Our tank is quite old and it's time to get a new one. I trust his recommendation! Thanks, Erik, and thanks again, Anderson Plumbing, for taking care of us as VIP members!< /text>

Live in a condo & had a leak inside the kitchen wall. The leak damaged the ceiling downstairs. Called Anderson Plumbing, technician James Padgett, and he is so professional. Compared to other plumbers, his knowledge & people skills are excellent. He opened the wall, diagnosed the problem, offered options & estimates, then proceeded to repair everything that needed repaired. The quality of the work is first class & no debris was left behind. I'd rate the service 10 out of 10. Then he came back to install a pressure regulator. Again, extremely friendly & professional. The quality of the work was awesome. I really like my experience with this company, will advocate for them, & will use them again in the future. Patrick..</Text>

<Text>After spending a day trying to unclog a toilet I realized I needed a plumber!
I noticed that Anderson Plumbing had a special of unclogging any drain for $53.  Seemed too good to be true, but it actually was the case, and am so glad I called them as they had the correct toilet auger and the toilet now works as it should!!
Thank you Anderson Plumbing, you really did WOW me!!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

My plumbers were very meticulous and thorough. They had clear explanations of the problem and steps to fix them.  I was especially pleased with their attention to detail regarding cleanliness. Even though our house is not the cleanest in the world, they still took time to put their booties on every time they came in the house in order to prevent tracking dirt. I really appreciated that detail.<//text>

George, my technician, provided outstanding service during the service call on 12/6/17.  He was prompt and courteous.  He was neat, clean and his uniform presented the company well.  He was proficient at his job, ensured to maintain cleanliness at the work site, and took care to protect my floors and home from any damage.  He thoroughly explained what the problem was and the repairs he was making.  He offered good tips on dealing with the water issues in San Diego.  He thoroughly deserves the 5-star rating.  Thanks George.<//Review>

Anderson Plumbing is the best.  They are ethical, competitively priced, a pleasure to work with.  Specifically, Ricardo Sandoval is the best of the best.

< Review>
They made a very messy plumbing issue a no problem issue. The guys that came over were professional and a enjoyment to spent several long days with. I was quoted a price on the first day and that’s the price I paid on the last day, there was no added expense. From what two of my friends told me I got a fair price for the mess and I mean mess that had to be fixed. I would use them again and tell my friends to call them if they needed a plumber fast.</Review>

The repair team was courteous and knew what to do.  I appreciated that
they explained everything as they went along, even showed me before and after pictures.  Katy is an excellent technician, and takes the time to be sure you understand what they are doing.  I highly recommend this team!< /review>

Rudy performed our annual VIP plumbing inspection.  He inspected all of the toilets and sinks in our home.  In addition, he drained our two water heaters.  We also requested him to clear a bathroom sink drain, repair a kitchen faucet and re-pipe a drain in our laundry room.   From the time Rudy arrived, he immediately went to work and completed a thorough inspection.  It was a difficult task to clear the bathroom sink.  It required full disassembly and replacement of parts.  He diagnosed the back-up problem in our laundry room and was able to resolve the drainage issue.
It took three hours to complete all of this work.  We are very appreciative of Rudy's high quality work and commitment to fixing each problem correctly.<//Text>

Our family has been a customer of Anderson's since the days of Walter
Anderson.  There's a reason these folks are always voted best in so many consumer polls: Top notch service from initial contact to completion of any job.  As I VIP customer, I receive regular inspections on the plumbing and HVAC in my home.  The techs are prompt, courteous, professional and always willing to answer any questions or concerns.<//Text>

Ms. Katy,

Katy was the best technician I have ever had work on my AC unit.  She found the back wiring connection and had the unit back up and running after troubleshooting the problem of freezing up.  She came after 7:00PM the very same day I called and was working when most people were off and home with their families.

I appreciate her for her effort.

James was on time, as I told them that I had just got off a 12 hour shift and had to work tonight.  They worked with me and I really appreciated it. The work was done quickly and efficiently. James was very polite and explained all that was going to take place. I will recommend this company to everyone that I know. Great employee and great work!!!

<review>First if of , I appreciated the fact that the technician came early in the day, and not 30 minutes prior to the end of the "morning" time frame. I've lost hours of personal leave from work due to the service provider's inconsiderate scheduling tactics.
The technician, Johnny Castro, was prompt, professional, and knowledgeable! But most of all she displayed sincere empathy to my situation.</review>< pictures>

This has been a long drawn out process. We had 4 quotes for our new air conditioning. Although Anderson did not come in the least expensive we liked the professionalism and warranty. But things went downhill from there. Communication was horrible. We were to have our install Monday morning and I had to call Friday just before 5 to find out when they were coming. Upon install they could not get the wireless thermostat to install and said they were going to send someone back out to connect it. I again had to call 4 days later to find out when someone was coming to fix or replace it. He could not fix it- and had to come back again with a new unit. Sooooo we thought everything was great and  then we got a call that they installed the incorrect (Lower power) unit. So we had to schedule another install date. Again no one called to let us know when they were coming out- a “discount check” was promised to be mailed or brought with the technician and of course it wasn’t so they had to send a runner with the check. Bottom line we are super happy with the product and all of the people that come to our home. But the people in the office lack all sorts of professionalism.<//review>

<review>Larry was courteous and professional and educational when teaching my how to clean/maintain my own plumbing needs if I choose to.
Because of his expertise, we tried to actually find more work for him to fix to get his opinion on other issues, besides my initial dishwasher drainage problem.

I am very grateful for his work , and he actually saved me a lot of time.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

James B from Anderson is a fantastic plumber. I thought the drain from the toilet to the main line was blocked but he ran a few tests and determined the blockage was actually in the low-flow toilet itself. The problem was that the flush handle was not being held down long enough with the result that  the bowl was getting insufficient water so  toilet paper was not being pushed through the trap (located in the toilet) to the sewer pipe. On these low flow toilets you can't just press and release the handle- if you do the flapper valve will close prematurely. You must press and hold the handle down to keep the flapper valve open until all the water in the tank has entered the bowel.</Text>

Justin replaced our water heater.  His work ethic was remarkable, and he worked straight through without a break until the job was done.  He was extremely pleasant and enjoyable to talk with.  His work was thoroughly professional and careful, and the finished installation looks perfect. I would be happy to have him perform any plumbing job in my home.< /Text>

When Eric left, everything was working fine.  No problems.  Easy to work with and very neat and orderly.  Communicated well as to what he was doing and what he was thinking.

Justin did a great job fixing the broken water heater and also dealing with the high water pressure issue. He was patient with our landlord and took the time to fix the much needed repairs. Glad to have everything up to date and Anderson was able to respond to our issue so quickly and effectively.</text>

< review>
I am Wowed once again!  We have been using Anderson Heating and Plumbing for several years, not only for our own home, but also our rentals.  The technicians are always courteous, knowledgeable, and efficient. Years ago we went through several plumbers, that on the face of it were cheaper, but they took much long and often did not do the job correctly.  You get what you pay for.  This is a top notch firm, that often prices out much better because they know what they are doing and have the supplies with them. Thank you!  Kuddos to James who found the problem today, and fixed it in no time!!!!</review>

I  needed a new furnace and air conditioner.  I am a VIP member of Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  I was thoroughly impressed with everyone I came into contact with.  Megan was personable, knowledgeable and clear in her explanations of different systems and prices.  Sal and Mac who came to do the installations were friendly, efficient, and very conscientious about clean up.  Thanks also to Kathy at Customer Service  for great support.< /review>

From the initial phone call, which made me smile, to last hand shake, working with Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air was great!  Alex arrived, assessed the situation and clearly explained all of my options.  He was clear and answered all of my questions, and I ask a lot of questions.  He quickly took care of the necessary repairs and made sure I was in great shape before leaving.  I am incredibly happy with their honesty and way of doing business.  Thank you Alex and thank you Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air!<//Text>

Jason, our plumber saved the night. He was professional and competent. Rate was reasonable, considering we needed after hour service to unclog the seeer line to get toilet and tub working again.
Thankfully my husband had already removed the toilet from the floor to access the sewer line, bit clog was too deep for him to get to, but if if he had not removed toilet and then replaced it after Jason left, then gets much more expensive.< /review>

After finishing some remodeling/refinishing on our house, we needed our duct system upgraded to better fit our home. After using Anderson numerous times before (and signing up for their VIP program) they were the only company I wanted to come do the work. Samson and Pauly were punctual, courteous, and immediately put on their booties and laid down drop cloths to protect my floors. They explained to me what they would be doing today before even bringing their tools into the house. They were focused in their work, respectful, and had the house cleaned up before walking me through to show me the new changes, as well as turn the system on and off to ensure everything was spot on. I will continue to use Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air for all my plumbing, a/c and furnace needs!!<//Review>

Anderson does good work, especially if you need repairs within a short period of time. They are very expensive. They do give you upfront pricing, but not itemized pricing. It seems that the hourly rate can work out to $500-600 / hour on top of a trip charge. The tech also jumped into trying to sell several other high ticket items, before wanting to discuss the issue to be repaired. It is also not professional to drop hints on how much he earns, while you feel you are being overcharged. Had we been able to wait, our $1000 job could have been done for about $500.< /Text>

We had our annual furnace inspection done by Eduardo A from Anderson. His service, attention to detail, and patience were exceptional. He put shoe covers on his feet before entering the house,  answered all questions asked of him regarding specs on the furnace. He was polite, professional and his work ethic is commendable.   Excellent decision in hiring him,  continue the great work.<//text>

The technicians were prompt, professional, friendly and kept their work area clean. The job was completed within the time that was estimated. Any concerns I had were addressed, and all my questions answered. I will definitely refer people to Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air</Text>

<review>They used to be fast and efficient.  but this weekend they lost a customer.  Friday night, with 12 guests at the house, my Mom's drain backed up while washing dishes..One they had worked on in September.  As  VIP customer, we were told the earliest appointment was Thursday, 5 days away!  Needless to say we called another company and got someone out the next morning.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I have had Mike G. check my furnace and ac for about 8 years now.  He is always professional, pleasant and efficient.  He comes in, does his job, cleans up after himself and explains what he has done and why it was necessary, if something needed repair.  He is a pleasure to have come into my home.  I wouldn't have anyone else!!< /Review>

Cory was concerned about what I wanted from the moment he walked in the door.  He kept me apprised of what his plan for installing a new air duct in my guest bath and installing an air cleaner on my heating and air unit.  He took great care to keep the work area clean and swept up anything that was still on the floor when he finished.  All in all a great experience.</Text>

I have been using Anderson Plumbing for a long time.  I have found all the technicians to be courteous and professional.  On the last maintenance call for my furnace, a wire to the compressor came loose after the tech left, but she battled the traffic at the end of the day to return and fix it...much appreciated!</review>

Brian Dudley did a 6-month inspection of my heating system and was very thorough and informative. He showed me all the things he checked, changed the filter, checked the air ducts and thermostat and even fixed a broken light switch that I'd been told couldn't be fixed! (The light switch was NOT on the list of things he was supposed to check; he went over and above the call of duty there!) Thanks for the great work, Brian!<//text>

<Review>I just had my furnace and air conditioning unit replaced by Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air.  My installer's name was Zachary Brock, and his assistant was Marcus.  Zac was very professional, friendly, and was always happy to answer any questions.  Both he and Marcus worked extremely well together and completed the install in a very timely manner.  They left the work area spotless and were always considerate to wear booties when walking in inside of the house.  I could not be happier with both of them.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I called for service and Sylvia went out of her way to get a Technician the same day I called. At first she said there were no appointments left for today. Sylvia consulted dispatch and told me a Highly Trained Technician would be arriving within 45 minutes. Tim Drumel arrived in 35 minutes! Tim's exceptional rapport and made me fell at ease right away. He performed a preliminary check and quickly went to work. He completed the job in an hour! (Clogged Toilet. Toilet had to be removed to snake sewer drain) I could tell that Tim was a professional. Quick, efficient, and great attention to detail. I am very satisfied with Tim's work. I forgot to mention that Sylvia also sent me an email before Tim arrived. It was a profile of Tim including a photo so you know exactly who is arriving to do the job. Thank you once again Tim for your good work ethic! Wow Thank you Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air!

I have been using Anderson Plumbing for a long time.  I have found all the technicians to be courteous and professional.  On the last maintenance call for my furnace, a wire to the compressor came loose after the tech left, but she battled the traffic at the end of the day to return and fix it...much appreciated!</review>

We’ve had Anderson perform a regular maintenance on our entire HVAC system. It’s not the newest system (ok its old!).  Usually we request Johnny Castro as he’s become familiar with our system and it’s quirks.  He is thorough, knowledgeable, professional, trustworthy, and great at explaining exactly what needs to be done, what any future concerns are and what’s working ok. Anderson is very fair in what needs to be fixed and how to keep it in the best condition they can for an old system. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them and especially, recommend tech Johnny Castro.< /Text>

Sal & MJ installed an air scrubber. They were efficient, meticulous in preparing the house by placing protective tarps on all floors. Also, they were friendly & very courteous. They worked rapidly & were finished much sooner than I expected. We are extremely pleased with all Anderson personnel who have worked on our Heating & Air.<//Text>

Ricardo came out to our house today to give us a second opinion on broken sewer lines in Spring Valley showing us with the camera that there was actually no damage done, we just had a block up in the sewer line. The other company was telling us that there was major damage and it would cost 17k to fix.

He kept me apprised of what his plan for installing a new air duct in my guest bath and installing an air cleaner on my heating and air unit.

<Review>Miguel one of the Drain Specialists at Anderson Plumbing and Heating was a pleasure to work with.  He was always available to explain various options for how to fix and improve my drain system.  He also pointed out ways we could save money.  Thank you Miguel!

Herman was the man on the job who did the work.  That guy can do anything from hammering thru a slab to the finesse work like soldering copper pipe supply lines.  My old 1959 house has awesome modern plumbing and drain system now.  He knows his stuff and explains everything in a friendly informative manner.  He came up with some great suggestions for improvements that I hadn't thought of.  The guy is pure gold!  Thank you Herman!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

He tried twice to reach it through an undersized cleanout, hoping to save us the cost to remove and replace the toilet - but this old house would not give up the fight so easily. James then consulted with me and I agreed to remove the toilet to give him better access. James doggedly refused to give up until he had a tricky reclosing congestion fully cleared. This was not routine (nothing in our old house ever is), but James rose to the challenge.

He was professional and courteous and communicated pricing and expectations clearly and honestly at every stage. In the end, he left us feeling the service was top notch and the price paid quite reasonable.

Anderson is lucky to have James Blacker. So were we.<//text>< date>

The technician was on time (actually early), resolved the problem quickly and fixed our air-conditioning system.  He taught me how to take the filters out and clean them every few months.  It was a very satisfactory service.< /Review>

<review>When my sixty year old cast iron pipes needed to be replaced a friend recommended Anderson Plumbing. I called them and Ricardo came out and looked at it. He explained what the problem was, what my options were and gave me an estimate. He was informative and professional. I decided to use their company. They were able to start the work in a couple of days,. Ruben and Michael were here every day on time and I have rarely seen men work so hard. In 100 degree heat. They had to dig up part of the slab in the garage, part of a sidewalk, my kitchen wall and big holes in my front lawn. Every night when they left everything was safe and tidy and put away, they were friendly and personable and knew what they were about. When the job was finished, everything had been restored, they even cut sod out of my lawn and replaced it perfectly. Ricardo made sure all was going well, which it was. They were respectful of me and my property, put up with my yappy little dog and all in all did an excellent job. I wholeheartedly recommend them and won't use anyone else. Top notch company!!</review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Anderson Plumbing, Heating, and Air has been great for each of the services I’ve used them for- and I’ve used them for all three!
Every time, the technician has arrived on time, and has been very nice, courteous, and respectful. I have never hesitated to let a single technician into my home. They seem like really nice people. Very professional.

Most of the time, there’s no upsell or extras… They come in, assess, and give recommendation options based on what they see. They provide hard facts and data to support their recommendations. There’s never any pressure to do anything. As a homeowner, I appreciate that. I appreciate each technician’s honesty and integrity. They always do good work on my house- and I definitely recommend Anderson PHA!< /Review>

My visit today from Quinton, was a perfect experience in every way!

Best check of the heating system ever. He  could and did explain the problems and also what the  could be done to solve them, in a way I could understand.
I will request him for future appointments.

Thank you Anderson  co< /Review>

<Review>Horrible service,  I called Anderson Plumbing service and they sent someone-who without looking where the leak said that he was going to charge $717 and later said that he will charge me less. He is not fix the leak and wanted to pay for $717 and the second day wanted an additional $717.< /Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< GmapID>

<review>I love Anderson Plumbing ,Heating and Air.
They have rescued my plumbing more than once. I have an older house and it is always needing something.
I can call and speak to a real person. I can have the same person who is familiar with my plumbing come out. They have all records of previous jobs.
You receive a warranty for work done. They are careful of your property and leave it clean and safe each day when they finish.
This is who you call when you want the job done right.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Time>

During installation, he discovered the previous toilet was installed incorrectly and rather than leaving it as-is, he informed me and fixed everything before installing the new toilet. Even gave me good carpentry advice, in addition to good plumbing advice! Will be getting a call from me in the future for any plumbing jobs.<//review>< Pictures>

Outstanding from start to finish.  Could not have been a better experience.  I will continue to use this impressive company.  Ken S. was our technician.  Exceptionally professional and thorough explaining what needed to be done, how he would proceed, and demonstrating the finished product.

<Review>I called Anderson to inquire about completely replacing my HVAC system in my home. When I scheduled the appointment I was assured someone would be at my home at a specific time, and that person would contact me the day of the appointment to confirm. On the day of my appointment, I never received a phone call, and even at the time of my appointment no one showed up.  20 minutes after when my appointment was going to be I had to contact Anderson to find out what happened. The operator for Anderson said "yes I see you at an appointment set for a specific time, let me see where our person is" then I was told "they will be there in 15 minutes". Well 25 minutes later and still no show, so I had to contact Anderson again. This time the operator started out giving me attitude saying "you don't understand, we don't set specific times for appointments, we give time frames".  I was then placed on hold for about 10 minutes while the operator called the person to see where they were. When the operator returned they said "Our man is at your front door right now". I about snapped because I was standing out front of my house waiting and saw nobody.  I wonder how a company that says they have great customer service can treat someone like this who isn't even their customer, and is looking to them to become their customer. If a company is this unprofessional, rude and disrespectful I would not want them doing any business with me, let alone in my house.< /Review>< Rate>

Every time, the technician has arrived on time, and has been very nice, courteous, and respectful. I have never hesitated to let a single technician into my home. They seem like really nice people. Very professional.

Most of the time, there’s no upsell or extras… They come in, assess, and give recommendation options based on what they see. They provide hard facts and data to support their recommendations. There’s never any pressure to do anything. As a homeowner, I appreciate that. I appreciate each technician’s honesty and integrity. They always do good work on my house- and I definitely recommend Anderson PHA!</text>

<text>It was a very nice experience with Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  Our water heater was leaking and upon calling Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air - Julie answered the call and was extremely nice and helpful. She took the information and informed me that a Service Technician would be calling within the next 4 hours prior to coming out that afternoon.  Within 10 to 15 minutes, I received another call back indicating a Service Technician would be able to make it out within 1/2 hour to 1 hour. Ruben Reyes arrived within the hour - extremely fast service.  He promptly reviewed the situation and provided the options for replacing the water heater.  He was able to replace the water heater that same afternoon. In addition, to replacing the water heater he provided additional great customer service by looking at our water filtration system that was installed by Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air 5 years ago and it checked out ok.  Ruben even added additional piping outside where the water filtration system drains so it would go further away from the house and actually water more of the outside bushes when it does drain.  Great for us and the area especially with the local water issues.  Thank you again to a Great Staff at Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air - keep up the good work.</text><Date>1435881277366<//Date><user_id>105473894379743638814< /user_id><user_name>John Sorahan<//user_name>< resp>

Magil Duran came out late on a Saturday and really went out of his way to identify where the water was leaking from the units and then rectify the problem.  He was extremely professional and efficient.  We really appreciate all he did and he reassured us that Anderson would do everything they can to fix the problem.  It’s frustrating when there’s problems with your new unit but it’s very comforting to know that the Anderson VIP service is going to make it right as soon as possible.

Johnny from Anderson Plumbing and Heating came over at 9 pm the same night we found a huge ceiling leak.  He fixed our HVAC problem and put us at ease!  We are so thankful he answered our calls when many other companies were done for the weekend!!!

A++ experience.  I had pipe start to leak about 1 month ago.  Called Anderson Plumbing and they were able to get someone out to my house quickly.  Chris B. fixed the leak and then recommended a whole home filter system to prevent future leaks.  I called this week to have the system installed and they still honored the quote given to me from a month ago.  Chris came back out to my home and installed the system in a timely and professional manner.  The work was top notch.  I am very pleased with the whole experience.  Recommend Highly!!!<//text>

We were very pleased with the prompt and exceptional Customer Service we received from Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air. Being that it was a busy Saturday; they still managed to fit us into their schedule on short notice.
From the moment we spoke to the technician Michael Probst; he was very friendly and willing to answer all of our questions without rushing us off the phone. He arrived at our home in the time frame he said he would be here.
I would highly recommend this company to anyone.<//review>

Donald did a great job, answering all of our questions and informing us of all the options with maintaining our HVAC system. He went the extra mile to put a huge smile on our face! He's the guy we'll look to for keeping our house cool in the summer and warm in the winter! Thank so much Donald, and thank you Stephanie for the easy appointment setup!!</Review>

Would give no stars if that was an option. I made the appointment and the scheduler told me it would be a warranty job.  As soon as Ken got to the house he started arguing with me about warranty work etc...  Ultimately wasted my time, didn't offer to perform the job and argued with me all the way out the door. I was astounded with the fact Ken argued with me the whole time.  Lazy and not helpful at all.  Oh and they are the most expensive in the city.  ASI worked on my tankless heater for 80 dollars.  Anderson wanted over 200 plus a diagnostic charge of 200 despite the fact I told them the code was just to descale.</text>

When I first called Anderson Plumbing it was to fix the thermostat on my air conditioner. They told me that the unit was old (7 years old) and could not be replaced. That I would need to put in a new unit with new air conditioners. Having spent thousands of dollars with this company I figured that I had enough experience with them so that I could call them to fix a simple problem with the hot water in my shower. When they came I was told that I needed a new water softener unit for another few thousand dollars but my shower was fixed for the time being.
A couple of days later,when I had the same problem with the hot water in my shower, I made another appointment. At this appointment ,with another technician, I was told that I needed a different unit ,for another few thousand dollars, and the unit the first technician told me I needed wouldn't work. At this point I decided that I needed a second opinion from another company. In the meantime I found that the last guy they sent out had broken the hot cold water mixer on my shower. They escalated the problem to a repair supervisor who came out that week. He told me that they would have to replace the mixer on my shower, at no cost to me, and would call me in 2 days with an update as well as the exact cost of the new water softener unit he said I needed.
Two weeks later I still hadn't heard back from him. On the third week I received a message on my machine stating that the mixer had to be ordered from the manufacturer  and he would call me back the next day to discuss it. He had already tols me that it had to be replaced and I had foolishly assumed that he would do that first thing not three weeks later.
Three months later I still hadn't heard back from Anderson when I received an email message telling me it was time to make a service appointment on my air conditioners. I wrote back that I wouldn't be making any appointments with Anderson and to please remove me from their mailing list. That day I got a phone call from a very nice understanding lady who stated she was new to the job but that she was trying to straighten out problems that customer had had. She told me she would call Jose,the supervising technician who had come out the last time, and get back to me. True to her word she called me back the next day and informed me that she had ordered the part. She offered to call me every week to keep me updated which I declined.
Finally,after months, I got a call from her that the new part had come in and we made an appointment to install it.
The next time I tried to use my shower I found that only scalding hot water was coming out. No cold water to mix the hot water with. I called them to tell them what the situation was and she offered to send Jose back out to check on the problem. She informed me that since I had a tankless hot water system sometimes it took some time for the new unit to adjust. Now this explanation made no sense to me and if it makes sense to you then I'd suggest Anderson for your plumbing needs. It seems that in fixing one problem they always create a new one. To have them come out to try to fix it would be free but even at free it's far to expensive for me.
I wouldn't recommend Anderson to anyone  They're always   trying to sell you something new and can't seem to be able to do what they are hired to do correctly.
Stay far far away from this company.

I called Anderson to inquire about completely replacing my HVAC system in my home. When I scheduled the appointment I was assured someone would be at my home at a specific time, and that person would contact me the day of the appointment to confirm. On the day of my appointment, I never received a phone call, and even at the time of my appointment no one showed up.  20 minutes after when my appointment was going to be I had to contact Anderson to find out what happened. The operator for Anderson said "yes I see you at an appointment set for a specific time, let me see where our person is" then I was told "they will be there in 15 minutes". Well 25 minutes later and still no show, so I had to contact Anderson again. This time the operator started out giving me attitude saying "you don't understand, we don't set specific times for appointments, we give time frames".  I was then placed on hold for about 10 minutes while the operator called the person to see where they were. When the operator returned they said "Our man is at your front door right now". I about snapped because I was standing out front of my house waiting and saw nobody.  I wonder how a company that says they have great customer service can treat someone like this who isn't even their customer, and is looking to them to become their customer. If a company is this unprofessional, rude and disrespectful I would not want them doing any business with me, let alone in my house.</Text>

By 9:30 the problem was fixed. Amazing service! Very professional and polite. I would highly recommend to anyone in need of plumbing or HVAC help. I will definitely use them again.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1544550001601, 'text': 'So awesome to hear we were able to help so quickly Craig!

Kevin did a great job explaining in detail the problem with your A/C unit.  He came in a timely manner from when we received the phone call of when he was expected to arrive. He was thorough with his assessment and took his time with what he recommended. We did not feel any pressure to move decide or move forward right then and there. He laid out all possible options and left reassuring us that either decision Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air would accommodate. Thank you for great customer service!</Text>

Our A/C went out on Monday, we called Anderson for service and they came out on Tuesday, flipped the circuit breaker, it came on and they left. The temp didn't change with the motor running, so they came out again on Wednesday to install a new thermostat. The next day it still wasn't right, so we called them again and they couldn't get back to us until the following Monday! After a heat wave over the weekend, Monday arrived and they had to switch out two more thermostat's before it worked correctly. We would have been "Wow'd" if they fixed it correctly the first time and didn't make us wait four more days to help us out.<//text>

My visit today from Quinton, was a perfect experience in every way!

Best check of the heating system ever. He  could and did explain the problems and also what the  could be done to solve them, in a way I could understand.
I will request him for future appointments.

Thank you Anderson  co<//Text>

I am a VIP customer (cancelled) who had three problems in my bathroom.  A very knowledgeable technician arrived on time to bid on repairing problem.  Prices quoted were absurd, like an automobile repair,
Each item was individually priced: e.g.  $200 to put flapper on toilet and reinsert flush handle (I had the parts); $200 to look under sink to repair leak ( loose plastic nut on drain lever) and no quote to repair leaking faucet as he didn't have the part on truck even tho when I made the appointment I specifically stated the the make of the faucet handle.
Just beware of prices quoted.  Make sure you that you are able to do the work yourself, I did and saved $400 for less than a 20 minute repair.<//Text>

<review>I contacted Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air to set up appointments for maintenance of my A/C and water heater. The staff and technicians were all very helpful, pleasant and efficient.  During a check of my home water pressure the technician, Ken Slater , discovered that my main water valve was not operating correctly which resulted in my water pressure to be approximately 115 psi, almost double what is recommended.  Ken was very helpful and courteous and I am glad he caught this before any major damage was done to my water lines.  Many thanks go to the Anderson employees.

I had my AC maintenance check and Mr. Johnny Castro was my HVAC Maintenance Technician.  He was very nice and professional and addressed all of my concerns and questions.  My AC unit was using excessive power which can effect the performance over the longterm so I purchased a fairly inexpensive device that significantly reduced the power demand into well within the normal range.  I really appreciated this suggestion to help extend the lifetime of my AC unit.  I was also using more air filters than I needed which was affecting the efficiency of my system.  I really appreciated the education about my AC system.  Johnny is very knowledgeable and personable. Having a technician that is highly competent and knowledgeable and who seems to care about me as a client is why I stay with Anderson Plumbing.  I am really thankful for their care for my home over the past years.  Thank you!<//text>

John W. technician was very professional and thorough in solving our plumbing issue. He gave the plumbing issue in detail which gave me a better understanding of the problem. He fixed the plumbing problem within the hour. I will definitely recommend Anderson Plumbing to other people. Thank you again for fixing our plumbing issue quickly.<//Review>

Justin was professional and did a great job installing a new water heater. He explained in detail why we needed a new water heater, the features of the new water heater, and how much it would cost. He gave us three estimate for the water heater alone, and then the water heater and some plumbing work. He never forced the sale and we felt comfortable with him the whole way. Anderston Plumbing, Heating & Air is a great company and employees like Justin are the reason why.< /Text>

I am a VIP customer (cancelled) who had three problems in my bathroom.  A very knowledgeable technician arrived on time to bid on repairing problem.  Prices quoted were absurd, like an automobile repair,
Each item was individually priced: e.g.  $200 to put flapper on toilet and reinsert flush handle (I had the parts); $200 to look under sink to repair leak ( loose plastic nut on drain lever) and no quote to repair leaking faucet as he didn't have the part on truck even tho when I made the appointment I specifically stated the the make of the faucet handle.
Just beware of prices quoted.  Make sure you that you are able to do the work yourself, I did and saved $400 for less than a 20 minute repair.</Text>

Eric Teran is a real pro! he's very personable and easy to talk to.  from the beginning you feel right at ease.  he explains everything clearly and takes time to answer any questions you have, even while he's working.  he did everything that was needed, and he left the work space very clean.  afterwords, he showed how everything was done and sat down to explain how everything works.  we're extremely happy with job.  it's so nice to have a QUIET hot water heater. there is no more banging coming from the garage and it works great!  you can send Eric back out anytime we need something fixed.
THANKS again eric

<review>After a number of calls to various plumbing companies I got in contact with Anderson plumbing.  I had a leaking pipe and all companies were booked for the new week out or longer.  Anderson however took the time to check for any cancellations on a Friday and said they could have someone out later that afternoon.  My technician was Ken and he was super friendly and helpful with all the questions I had.  Our leak was in the attic and we have a tankless water system.  The area where our leak was had been over complicated with a number of bends and unused feed off points.  Ken replaced the copper piping and simplified the water flow for less stress on the piping.  He took the time to turn on all the faucets after repairs to flush all the air in the lines and showed me the new piping that he replaced to make sure he answered any questions I might have.  Anderson plumbing and Ken were very professional.  From talking to the booking agent on the phone to having all my questions answer to finding someone to come out so I didnt have to worry for an entire weekend.  Great company and I highly recommend them!!!!< /review>< pictures>

Had Miguel and Bethany install a water heater and pressure regulator for the house. Very professional and friendly. Kept us informed every step of the way.
Contacted Anderson via web-site, did not get reply within 24hrs. As advertised. I called a few days later to get the service we needed.

<review>WOW -I had a problem with a tank less water heater.  I needed a "before noon"  appointment the next day and they made it happen. They were on time and very courteous and professional. They gave me 3 different options  to solve my problem.  Not a "you need this" attitude.  A picked my option and thought they would come back in a day or two to do the job.  That did not happen!! They ( Eric the tec ) went back to the shop and picked up everything need for the job. He returned and did the job right away.  That is customer service at it's best.  I will definitely be calling Anderson Pluming  in the future.  (that is if the need arises)   Thank's so much for your quality service.      David<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Oh my goodness!! This was my first experience with Anderson Plumbing and I hope I have to use them again!! Every step of the process was easy and I got an appt quickly. I received a heads up when they’d be there and then a call about what needs to be done and if I authorize the work. Then I received a follow up call that the work was completed. Which is the goal, but then I was educated on how to prevent it from happening again. Given tips on what to do if it does. It was just so nice to deal with someone that genuinely cared and not just going through the motions. Having things go wrong when life is already busy and full of stress sucks, but now I know if my sink clogs again and I call Anderson Plumbing they take of the hard part!!

Thank you again sooooooo very much!!!<//text>

My technician Justin B was a true professional and knowledgeable with a passion for his job. I son’t know why I waited so long to call Anderson PHA for any issues around my house. I’ve called other big names companies on weekend and was told they couldn’t help since I wasn’t a previous customer.  I hope my neighbors enjoyed seeing the PINK truck in front of my house.  I’ve already passed the word onto my neighbors and co-workers.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I had a clogged sewer line at my home. Anderson was able to provide a prompt appointment. Larry F and Dylan were the technicians who came to my house. They were very professional. They explained the issue and walked me through the intended work. The pricing was upfront and accurate. I would recommend using Anderson Plumbing to anyone with plumbing issues.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

He appeared knowledgeable and completed the work efficiently and effectively.  The place was left clean.  He replaced a shower/bath combo fixture set which included opening up the wall and doing some pipe work.  I have confidence that we will love it for years to come.  He also replaced a valve under our kitchen sink.  So happy with the work.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<userid>110603913851782269625</userid><time>1535235701368</time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>After a number of calls to various plumbing companies I got in contact with Anderson plumbing.  I had a leaking pipe and all companies were booked for the new week out or longer.  Anderson however took the time to check for any cancellations on a Friday and said they could have someone out later that afternoon.  My technician was Ken and he was super friendly and helpful with all the questions I had.  Our leak was in the attic and we have a tankless water system.  The area where our leak was had been over complicated with a number of bends and unused feed off points.  Ken replaced the copper piping and simplified the water flow for less stress on the piping.  He took the time to turn on all the faucets after repairs to flush all the air in the lines and showed me the new piping that he replaced to make sure he answered any questions I might have.  Anderson plumbing and Ken were very professional.  From talking to the booking agent on the phone to having all my questions answer to finding someone to come out so I didnt have to worry for an entire weekend.  Great company and I highly recommend them!!!!< /Text>< Resp>

Anderson Plumbing was one of the only companies to return our call when we needed immediate service for our AC over the holiday weekend. They returned our call within 24 hours and had someone out to service the AC the very next day, (Maria really knows her stuff). The AC was up and running within a couple of hours. Everyone from the dispatcher to the office staff and our technician was professional, courteous and responsive.< /Review>

I recently had a new water heater installed in my home. Ken S was the installer, he did a great job, was courteous, neat and clean. When finished, he cleaned up what little mess created and left the work area spic and span. I was very happy with the service.</text>

He is articulate and cogent in his discussions with me at every step he was taking on the Air Conditioning system he was servicing.

He is the type of young man which expresses what your Logo says.  I actually though he said, "Nobody loves clients like we do" and of course I though, how perfectly it suits the person Jacob is.  That was until I went to your site and realized that had said the word "Wows", not "Loves" and had myself a good laugh, because I have hearing aids that sometimes do not pick up intonations or certain verbal cues.

Next year when I have my system serviced, I would hope that you send someone like Jacob who helps me feel very confident in their capabilities and willingness to share their knowledge.

I am very particular about the types of service people I have work on my stuff, whether it was my new roof, or having my car service, or my plumbing work done.  Anderson has proven so far that they will be my go to company to take care of my STUFF !!

I had a clogged sewer line at my home. Anderson was able to provide a prompt appointment. Larry F and Dylan were the technicians who came to my house. They were very professional. They explained the issue and walked me through the intended work. The pricing was upfront and accurate. I would recommend using Anderson Plumbing to anyone with plumbing issues.</Text>

<Text>The technician was punctual, courteous, clean and knowledgeable. He explained everything he found, gave us options for what we could do now, what needed done soon, and the pricing. We called and got a tech on the same day which was a blessing. We are very pleased with the speed of service and the technician they sent.< /Text>< time>

Larry was professional through and through. He explained what he was doing—and proposed to do later—thoroughly. I received full documentation and price quote. We've used Anderson Plumbing for quite a few years and plan to continue.</Text>

<Text>WOW -I had a problem with a tank less water heater.  I needed a "before noon"  appointment the next day and they made it happen. They were on time and very courteous and professional. They gave me 3 different options  to solve my problem.  Not a "you need this" attitude.  A picked my option and thought they would come back in a day or two to do the job.  That did not happen!! They ( Eric the tec ) went back to the shop and picked up everything need for the job. He returned and did the job right away.  That is customer service at it's best.  I will definitely be calling Anderson Pluming  in the future.  (that is if the need arises)   Thank's so much for your quality service.      David</Text>< Rating>

Jamar was unbelievable.  Friendly, professional and went the extra mile.  I had a water heater replaced and he also installed an electronic device for eliminating scale in my pipes.  A very good thing to do if you live in So. Cal.

GREAT JOB!</text>

<rate>5</rate><text>After a number of calls to various plumbing companies I got in contact with Anderson plumbing.  I had a leaking pipe and all companies were booked for the new week out or longer.  Anderson however took the time to check for any cancellations on a Friday and said they could have someone out later that afternoon.  My technician was Ken and he was super friendly and helpful with all the questions I had.  Our leak was in the attic and we have a tankless water system.  The area where our leak was had been over complicated with a number of bends and unused feed off points.  Ken replaced the copper piping and simplified the water flow for less stress on the piping.  He took the time to turn on all the faucets after repairs to flush all the air in the lines and showed me the new piping that he replaced to make sure he answered any questions I might have.  Anderson plumbing and Ken were very professional.  From talking to the booking agent on the phone to having all my questions answer to finding someone to come out so I didnt have to worry for an entire weekend.  Great company and I highly recommend them!!!!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<review>I just had a LOT work done on my heating and air conditioning system and couldn't be more pleased. A fantastic job was done by John C. and Donald M. They were extremely courteous, efficient and patient in explaining what they were doing. It took them a couple of days to give you an idea of how much work I had done and not because they were slow. They worked quickly and expertly. They covered all the areas that they had to work in and when finished, you wouldn't even know they were there. Anderson Plumbing has several employees that I have had the need for service and they were ALL TOP QUALITY in what they had to do. These two men were even better than that. Anderson Plumbing is the way to go!!</review><date>1475099773371<//date>< user>

As always Anderson Plumbing sent out another terrific tech Ruben R researched the problem and was able to fix it in a timely manner.
We have had so many issues with plumbing and heating in one unit. All has been resolved very professionally. You are a great company there in San Diego. I'm glad that I saw one of your trucks outside of Home Depot on Sports Arena Blvd.and called.
Thank you

< Review>
Dick Crandall was the representative that came to my house and gave me a bid, and explained to me exactly what  work was going to be done. Jacob and Adrian were the installers. They were professional, knowledgeable, and very courteous. They both possess great people skills. I was given a job time estimate of 3 days, but the guys were so proficient at their job, that they finished the whole job in only 2 days. There were also 2 other great young men that came out and did the electrical work for my heating& AC upgrade, and they also re-ducted my whole system. I am completely satisfied with the job. I am 100% satisfied with the whole Anderson team effort. I would recommend this company, and their great employees to anyone.</Review>

<review>I was impressed throughout every step of the experience. I filled out an online request for an appointment on Sunday, Monday at 8:30am I received a call to schedule an appointment. during the scheduling I was informed about Anderson Plumbing Co. I felt comfort right away in my selection, My appointment was book the next day. I received a call 1/2 hour before arrival and they were right on time. The tech James was knowledgeable and professional. He discovered the source of leak within 5 min, and completed the faucet replacement in 45min. What a difference Anderson Plumbing was to it larger San Diego competitor. I won't be using Howe Plumbing anymore.<//review>< gmapID>

Anderson PHA is fortunate to have an excellent staff working for them. They took care of our major drain repair with skill and confidence, and explained the steps along the way.

They also recently did a faucet repair and did an excellent job.</text>

<Review>Donald did an excellent job of installing the air-conditioning unit. It took two and a half days to complete the job and during that time we did not experience any major interruptions to our daily routine of caring for our eight month old granddaughter.  Donald was extremely courteous and very polite.  He always had a smile for our granddaughter and would let us know when and if we needed to go to an area of the house where there was less noise and dust in the air.  He would check with us if he had a question and keep us informed of the progress of the job. I can’t say enough good things about Donald. It was a pleasure to have him and his coworker in our home.  Needless to say he and Jose were very professional and extremely proficient. they are  a beacon to others in the profession. It is with deep appreciation for a job well done that I write this review!</Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Anderson Plumbing is my new favorite plumbing company here is San Diego. I've used them twice now and have been happy both times. The office staff are courteous and helpful. Both times they sent someone right away even though it was not an emergency. Both technicians were so great. They made good future suggestions and fix the issue at hand quickly and gave us the best price possible. I actually have several plumbers in the family but in other states. With Anderson's nearby I no longer feel bad that my family plumbers are not around. Tim was so sweet to my mother (a bit of a talker) patiently listening to a story or two-LOL
Thank you Anderson's for making a bad plumbing situation into a pleasure! Susan<//Review>< pics>

1st, EVERYONE I came in contact with from Anderson was HAPPY, Friendly and appeared to enjoy the job.  Positive people make everything OK.

Our Sales Consultant Javier C was one of the only Sales people I remembered. We got several quotes.  He listened to me...I had a lot to say.  He was knowledgeable without throwing out all of the jargon from his industry.  Javier did not bug me...respected my space let me make decisions.  He did not manipulate our time.  He DID not bash his competitor.  He is sharp!  I did not feel like I was being ripped off.  Javier was honest.  Note: to Anderson competitor's bashing ones competition is a very unattractive tool to use, so stop it.

CLEAN no one looked like a worker.  One of gentlemen John C. very nice got his shirt dirty in our attack (who does not have a dirty attack) and let us know he was going to the truck to change it!  This group made me feel good about paying!  Another gentleman seen my darling dog get out and let me know even while my husband shushed him. Wonderful!

The best compliment I can give is to recommend Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air.  Which I will do!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>My husband, Russell and I were extremely pleased with the Customer Service we received from Brooks S..  Excellent Customer Service is almost unheard of anymore.
He answered both of our questions to the point where there were no questions left.  Both Brooks and Steve were very courteous.  There is no way that you can be paying them what they are worth.

We originally started with a new Water Heater with you and this was a return visit.

Thank you kindly,

<rating>5</rating><text>Smelled gas coming from beneath our stove, which is very alarming. Shut off the valve underneath, aired out the kitchen, but hours later still smelled a bit of gas. Called something like 5 different plumbers asking for help as I have three young kids in the house and a wife who is due to have our fourth ANY MINUTE! Very much a serious situation. Despite this, every plumber I called either didn't respond or they were too busy to help. Then, I realized a family member recently used Anderson and she gave me the name and number of the actual technician that helped her out so I gave them a call and asked for James by name.  They appreciated how urgent this situation was, and James came out right away. He and his teammate arrived and were pleasant to work with from the start. They were always professional, and obviously experts at what they do. Throughout the entire process they communicated with us frequently so we always knew what was going on, what progress they've made, what their recommendations are, and what options we had. They were also very clear and direct with the costs associated with each option, and we never felt pressured into paying some exorbitant amount for optional services. They worked hard the entire time, being very sensitive to my family's particular situation. After the gas leak was fixed, James came back a few more times in the following days to do further tests to make absolutely certain things were done right and that everything was still holding up after they made the repairs. He even came out personally to meet with underground leak detection services (a third party), spoke to city gas company on our behalf to get our gas turned back on, and worked directly with the city inspectors office to get all the appropriate inspections and paperwork in order. Now, my family has gas service again! More importantly, this means we have a working clothes dryer, furnace, and HOT WATER. I could not have asked for a better experience in an otherwise really difficult situation.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

This was the first time I called Anderson for my plumbing needs.  Larry was able to come out the next day.  He explained in detail how the drains worked, where problems might occur and offered suggestions on ways to extend the life of some of our new fixtures.  Our plumbing problem is pretty extensive so he crawled under the house to identify the problem.  We had to clean up the sewage spill and he was able to recommend a company to do it before they could repair the damage.  In the end, they appeared to know their business inside and out and I felt comfortable using them.<//Review>

< review>
Anderson Plumbing has completely unreasonable prices. Honestly, I really can't understand how they can have so many 5 star reviews unless people really don't care how much they pay for plumbing service.  Here are the facts of my case: I had a plumbing leak which they located for $262 when two other plumbers where quoting $130 for leak location.  I went with Anderson since they were the first to be able to come to my house.  After they found it they quoted $900 to repair a simple copper elbow. Another company quoted me a third the cost over the phone. Then came and fixed it in less than 30 mins.  It is sad to think some customers unfamiliar with plumbing rates trusting a company's quote as fair and paying literally $1800 per hour for a simple job, but if you go with Anderson be prepared for that sort of sticker shock.  Funny their tag line is "Nobody wows customers like we do."  Wow!</review>

Very happy with the speed of response, friendliness of the of the scheduler, and the professionalism of the technician (Ken) sent to take care of my leak. This is the second time we've needed a plumber due to a water leak/failing pressure regulator in about a 5 year span, and Anderson has done well for us both times. As a return customer, I felt confident in what to expect, and I wasn't disappointed.< /Review>

<Text>I had my VIP AC service done a few days ago.  The technician was very nice and respectful.  After he had left, I noticed a strange hum coming from the vent.  I called Anderson the following day and reported the hum.  They came out today and discovered that it was the type of filter that was installed.  It wasn't the type I had used in the past, so it was making a different noise.  He replaced the filter and the strange hum disappeared.  The technician apologized for the unpleasant noise, even though it was not due to an error on his part.  Anderson really appreciates my business and I am very happy with their service.  The VIP service is great.< /Text><username>Alice Smith<//username><Response>None<//Response>< user_id>

<Review>I called Anderson plumbing to replace a water heater. Their bid was $2100 for a simple 40 gallon in a garage. Don't use this company!!! Way too expensive! Twice as much as I ended up spending! He said it would take 1/2 a day...it took a better part of an hour! This company has inflated prices.< /Review>< gmap_id>

< review>
Water line sprang a leak within the wall saturating the dry wall this past Sunday in my Mom's condo. George came to the rescue, repaired the leak in a professional manner. He was friendly and answered all my questions. Anderson is a great company so I always think of them first for all my plumbing needs.</review>

In addition, I mentioned a possible plumbing problem that causes noises throughout the night and he diagnosed a problem with my toilet flapper seal.

I am very grateful for the way in which he answered my questions with such detail; he was not rushed and was very patient, in addition to being professional and knowledgable.</review>< Pictures>

We called Anderson to fix our master bath shower.  While we were using our guest shower, it started leaking.  Anderson fixed that as well.  They called to let us know when they would arrive.  Technician arrived on time.  He answered all of our questions.  Was fast and efficient and knew what he was doing, many years of experience.

I would recommend Anderson Plumbing.<//text>

I had a plumbing leak.  Bernard came from Anderson PH&A.  He was on time.  He was very pleasant.  He was very smart and knew exactly what to do.  He finished the job promptly and cleaned up all mess.  It wasn’t cheap, but the quality was excellent.  I’d use him again.</text>

He did go to the attic to check the furnish. He did spend a lot of time checking the unit outside. Refrigerant is in low charge and added a solution  or something in the system (3.++ lbs). He also put some dye to the system for leak search and will follow through on a scheduled appointment on Aug 6, 2018. He will also come back on Sunday for the right size of the filter to put in.
In the past, last year when they installed the unit there were quite a bit of issues. There was a kind of leak in the system but did not do a leak search in particular to find where it's coming from.
So far today, we are pleased with what Mr. J. Castro had instituted. Job well done, thank you!
We are looking forward to solve this issue, and enjoy the rest of Summer months!<//text></record>

<Text>We have always had good results from Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air.  If we had a complaint, it was always fixed right away.

Reggie came to our home to fix a plumbing problem we were having.  His work was impeccable on other items repaired; however, the repair on the flusher and flapper on the toilet needed a minor adjustment and that was taken care of the next day by another technician (Sorry, I do not know his name).

Reggie did find the equipment attached to the water heater to push hot water into the master bath had not been turned on.  He gave me instructions as to how it turns on and how to regulate the timer.  Not sure if it had ever been turned on since it was installed several years ago. It is working perfectly as the hot water comes in immediately.  We installed this equipment to save water instead of running the water ahead of time in order to take a warm shower.  I gave Reggie five stars as he went out of his way to show me how to regulate this equipment.  He went above and beyond.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>We had a slow draining kitchen sink.   I hesitated calling a contractor, as many times in the past, we have had issues with calls not being returned.   This was certainly not the case with Anderson Plumbing.  I requested an appointment online, they called me shortly, and our appointment was set for that afternoon.  Larry called and said they could come earlier, which worked out great!  We also received an email with pictures of the technicians and said they were on their way.   We received a complete explanation of the work before they began and upon completing the job, Jimmy explained their findings and that our issue had been resolved.   Job well done!!!   I will never hesitate to call Anderson Plumbing if we ever have any plumbing issues in the future.   Thank you Larry & Jimmy!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The technician was punctual, courteous, clean and knowledgeable. He explained everything he found, gave us options for what we could do now, what needed done soon, and the pricing. We called and got a tech on the same day which was a blessing. We are very pleased with the speed of service and the technician they sent.<//Review>

As always Anderson Plumbing sent out another terrific tech Ruben R researched the problem and was able to fix it in a timely manner.
We have had so many issues with plumbing and heating in one unit. All has been resolved very professionally. You are a great company there in San Diego. I'm glad that I saw one of your trucks outside of Home Depot on Sports Arena Blvd.and called.

Larry is an outstanding ambassador for Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.

<Review>Mike G was not only pleasant but very informative about my system. He diagnosed the problem by ruling things out. Turns out I needed a new thermostat. I have a smart one and even that didn't throw him. The thermostat was under warranty. The repairs were free.

I have always been very happy with the techs from Anderson Plumbing that have done work at our house. They know their profession and are very efficient. On 5/12/14, George P. was not only these, but was also an extremely hard worker! In 7 hours he installed a new garbage disposal, toilet, and water heater by himself.<//review>

The 2 installers that came to our house (Jacob B. & Maurcus C) were very nice and friendly.  They went above and beyond what was asked and kept us informed of everything being done through the entire project.  They made sure that we were completely satisified with the work before leaving.  I would recommend the company and these 2 installers as well.< /review>

<Text>This was my first time contacting a plumbing company for a repair on my home and couldn't have been happier.  I really appreciated the upfront pricing - they explained this over the phone.  Eric T. arrived a few minutes earlier than expected and after hearing my explanation and looking at the PRV valve he knew that was the problem.  He also suggested replacing the main shutoff valve because of the age and I knew it was an honest recommendation and not just trying to sell additional services.  Eric did a great job with the repair and everything looked just as it did after he left, with the exception of a nice new pressure regulator valve.  I'd definitely use Anderson again!< /Text>< pics>

The installation of my Lennox air conditioner went smoothly without any problems. If it weren't for the cold air coming out of the vent ducts, you couldn't tell that the unit was running.

<Review>I was very pleased with the experience thanks to the expertise and proficient technician. He explained all the steps that was needed before he preformed  them and answered all my questions. This was very important to me because I know nothing about plumbing matters. He completed the job in the timeframe that he gave before he started the job. I am impressed and will recommend Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air to all my friends and co-workers.<//Review>< user_name>

Junior (technician) came to our home to evaluate our non functioning furnace. He was here several hours, and did great work in figuring out the problems, by replacing burned out circuit boards and other parts.  When he left the furnance was working.  He was concerned that something else might have been wrong. He called back in a few hours to check on its functioning, and by that time, it was not working correctly.  He had suggested we consider evaluating the need for a new furnance, since we were replacing so many parts.  We greatly appreciate his honesty and helpfulness with our whole situation.  We did in fact, talk to an Anderson advisor the next day, which helped us make the correct decision in replacing the furnace and original duct work.  We were unaware that the duct work was inefficient, and appreciated the information.
We now have a new furnace, with new duct work, which already appears to be more economical for us.
Thank you Anderson for employing great employees, like Junior, who was professional, courteous and very knowledgeable.</Review>

<resp>None</resp><text>I called Anderson Plumbing to repair a bathroom sink drain that was leaking.  I also had several small plumbing related jobs that I really did not want to do myself so I decided to have them perform this work in addition to the repair.  I had never contacted a plumbing service before and decided on Anderson Plumbing because they have been in business for so long and had a great rating with the BBB.  I can honestly say that it was a pleasure working with this company.  The phone representatives are polite and courteous.  The technician showed up on time, treated my home with care, and conducted himself in a professional manner.  The visit started with a walk through and discussion about the work to be performed, some Q&A, full disclosure of the charges (the forms they use are very detailed), and lastly a time estimate to complete the work.  The plumber, Reggie, did a wonderful job.  When he finished we performed another walk-through to review the repairs.  He answered all of my questions and provided some helpful tips.  I would definitely use this company again.<//text>< name>

<Text>The technician was pleasant and seemed knowledgeable about plumbing. He worked hard to fix my leak. However, it took three times for the problem to be rectified.  I spent close to $1000.00 and I am unemployed.  It was a lot of time and money.< /Text>< user_id>

< Review>
We were in a crisis with an unsuccessful attempt to snake our kitchen drain.
James arrived when they said he would; he was very professional, putting on booties over his work shoes to protect our carpet. He explained everything he could do, and the cost, etc.
Our problem was resolved well and I think my husband and I feel a little more educated about our own plumbing issues which are unique as the kitchen had been remodeled by the prior owner. Needless to say, the owner had made several errors!
We'll definitely use Anderson again!
Thank you James!< /Review>

< Review>
I had an excellent experience with Anderson Plumbing & Air HVAC service technician Michael Probst who quickly diagnosed the problem  with my non-operating  home heating system. Michael also was helpful in giving me information regarding the replacement of my old thermostats with more up-to date digital thermostats; but with no hard sell.</Review>

< review>
We called Anderson Plumbing because we had a slab leak.  Erik Egerstrom,  the plumbing technician came out in a timely manner.  He spent a lot of time looking for the leak and explaining everything to us.  He recommended that we call a leak detection company, which we did.  He followed up with us, and came out to give us a quote on repair.  He worked with us on pricing and was very professional and honest about what we needed and didn't need.  When he came to do the work, he and his apprentice got here at 9:30 AM and worked until 10:30 PM  because he wanted to make sure we had water for the weekend.  He then followed up after the weekend and finished the rest of the work.  Erik was professional, very knowledgeable and best of all honest!!  The drywaller and office staff were wonderful as well.  Thank you Anderson!!</review>

We have used Bernard on several occasions, the latest being last week.  He is always very professional, knowledgeable and helpful.  Very trust worthy - you do not feel like you've been taken.  Anderson Plumbing guarantees its work and it is a pleasure doing business with it and its employees.  Thankfully we now have a great plumbing company we can trust and feel good about calling whenever we have plumbing problems.

Thank you very much!

A group of young men named Joe Smithey, Brent Phillips, and Johnny Castro were the team of technicians who helped turn my house into a refrigerator.They were very courteous, knowledgeable, professional and hard working. The installation of my Lennox air conditioner went smoothly without any problems. If it weren't for the cold air coming out of the vent ducts, you couldn't tell that the unit was running.

< Review>

Michael P, the technician, was excellent.  He carefully analysed a complex situation with my HVAC and ultimately found the source of the problem, without having to replace a very expensive part that would have cost me more than $1,000.</Review>

I have used the services of Anderson for over 10 years and always recommend them.

<Text>Ron, the plumber was great! . I told him the property was in the middle of selling and we needed this I spection for the buyers today. We had requested a non intrusive camera scope to verify if there was a leak or moisture inside the wall. When he walked in empty handed I asked if he had the camera with him, he replied no, then I went off and reacted terribly.  Even though I was a l irrate, he remained calm.  I told him the owner specifically requested it when she ordered them to come out.  He immediately called his office to see what the issue was and found out that for some reason, whomever took the appointment did not put that in the call notes.
He calmly recommended some options of cutting into the wall and what that cost would be, or would have to wait until the plumber with the scope could be scheduled. We decided to remove a piece of drywall ourselves so he could look in and he thoroughly inspected the area visually and what he couldn't see he stuck his arm in the wall to feel around for any water or dampness. He was gracious the entire time and explained everything so clearly and calmed me down.  He also wrote up the findings on his tablet and emailed it directly to us while he was still on site. What a fantastic man and employee you have!  Sincerely, Denise Lisa, the owners realtor. I will definitely recommend your company to all of my clients. However please make sure your schedulers understand what the client is asking for, what type of plumber they need and write everything the customer requested, verbatim, in the remarks!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1539616748382, 'text': 'Thank you Denise for your 5 star review of Ron, and sharing your experience.

Outstanding customer service!!! Dave Grollman was right on time! Professional from the start to the finish. Did the work as promised, and did an outstanding job! At a great price too!!! Did a free inspection for me with one of the bathroom fixtures. Made excellent reccomendation's and replaced a leaky shut off valve under the kitchen sink free of charge! He brought me up to speed on some of the services offered by Anderson for A.C. and Duct inspections. Looking at A.C., and Anderson is in the lead at the moment.!!<//text>

I expected them to try to sell me a new one because mine is about 10 years old.  My Service Specialist was Javier. He was professional and friendly. He explained what he would do and why.  He checked out everything, and I could see that he knew what he was doing.  He checked out the unit inside and changed the filters and even vacuumed out the closet it was enclosed in.(it was really dusty)  He finished by installing a booster to the unit to get a few more years out of it.  I could tell the difference immediately!  I will continue to use this Company for all of my future needs. I felt that they are knowledgable and honest, and I will ask for Javier because he exceeded my expectations.< /Text>< Rate>

<review>Had problem with a toilet wobbling and leaking water from under base.  Problem was caused by previous plumber incorrectly setting a new toilet in place by trying to use two wax seals to make up for the flange being lower and not flush with the finished tile floor level.  Alex installed a new flange, level with the finished floor, and a new wax seal and then set the new toilet in place, using shims to eliminate any wobbling, and finally caulked around the entire base.  Alex was professional, courteous, and explained fully what he had to do, what the cost would be before he proceeded, then did the work and thoroughly cleaned up after himself when the work was completed.  will certainly use the company again if and when the need arises.<//review><Response>None</Response>< user_name>

< Review>
My 95 year old grandparents that have lived in the same house since 1953 had their water heater go out. They are on a fixed income and when something like this happens our family steps in to help. I am a general contractor and was working in LA at the time. Andersons Plumbers assessed the problem and fixed it within a couple of hours.
This company has the best interest of their clients in mind and no doubt I will be using them in the future.
Thank you to everyone that turned this nightmare into a pleasant experience.< /Review>

<review>Today was the 2nd time I have had Anderson Pluming Heating & Air to my house for repairs.  The first time was in June for A/C repair.  Today was for plumbing.  Both times I have been thoroughly impressed with the technicians’ knowledge and ability to complete the job quickly and efficiently.  This time I signed up for their VIP program because I know that I have a few more plumbing issues coming my way over the next 12 months and after today’s service, I wouldn’t call anyone else to do the job!  The technician that did my plumbing repair today was Ken Slater.  Ken was very professional and friendly, as well as being an expert plumber!  Ken gave me some recommendations to try and avoid the same situation in the future.  Thanks Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air for being a fantastic and reliable company!  You’ve got all of my future business!<//review><time>1412701800404<//time><user_name>Lauren Baker</user_name><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</GmapID><userid>106285754269245009736<//userid><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< Review>
The technician from Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air, sent to my house was Victor Jimenez.  He was thoroughly professional and knowledeable.   He treated me with respect and courtesy.  I am very happy with the work done.  I have been using Anderson plumbing since 2010.  He knew exactly what the problem was and proceeded to fix it in an efficient and correct manner.</Review>

<Review>Outstanding customer service!!! Dave Grollman was right on time! Professional from the start to the finish. Did the work as promised, and did an outstanding job! At a great price too!!! Did a free inspection for me with one of the bathroom fixtures. Made excellent reccomendation's and replaced a leaky shut off valve under the kitchen sink free of charge! He brought me up to speed on some of the services offered by Anderson for A.C. and Duct inspections. Looking at A.C., and Anderson is in the lead at the moment.!!</Review>< pictures>

Ken Slater was very knowledgeable and helpful! He explained the problem so we could understand the issues and provided options on how to fix the problem! He explained the installation and why some items had to be added to pass inspection. He installed the new water heater and cleaned up very well afterword. Ken answered all the questions we had so we could understand them.</review>

<date>1542905571324<//date><Name>Giovanna Thomas</Name><Review>I used Anderson for their plumbing services and I was satisfied with that work.  Despite being over priced, I liked both of the technicians who came to my house.  However, I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with HVAC services that I received.  The technician came to my house and instead of assessing all possible options (which I later learned there were other, cheaper options), he went straight to the $1300 blower motor option, which knowing nothing about HVAC, I figured that was what was needed.  The technician installed the blower motor and it worked for less than 24 hours.  Anderson came back and this time brought back a salesman who tried to pressure me into spending 9-10 THOUSAND dollars on a completely new system.  I felt very uncomfortable about the sales tactics and I could tell that my technician was also uncomfortable.  Eventually the salesperson left and the technician agreed to try a simple remedy, adding refrigerant to the system.  They were originally going to try to charge me $200 for this, but decided to spare me the expense.  The system worked for only a few hours.  I eventually changed the outlet and that got the system working for a couple of weeks.

It broke again, and after talking to other professionals in the area and my family friend back at home about it, they explained that I was completely ripped off and completely overcharged for something that failed to work.  They also explained that the prices that they were quoting me for a new system were completely absurd.  I feel completely taken advantage of; the company realized that my spouse and I were not savvy in the HVAC realm and they pounced on the opportunity to make as much money from us as possible.

I ultimately hired a new professional to fix my broken system and they explained that the motor that was installed by Anderson had already broke and also that there were other fixes to try prior to replacing the blower motor originally.  I tried to get some or all of my money back from Anderson, but they were very difficult to reach, have given me the runaround, and refuse to do anything because I did not give them the opportunity to fix the problem.  I explained that I know that they took advantage of me and that I was uncomfortable with their sales tactics and they just choose to slander the professional that I used to fix the problem and try to affix the blame on me in any way possible.

If you cannot tell, I am completely dissatisfied with the assistance that I received from Anderson and I will never use them ever again and will be sure to tell anyone who will listen to never use them again.  They just want your money and will pretend to be helpful and charming in an attempt to get you to trust them and spend all kinds of money on things that you do not need.

While searching for another plumbing company, their name came up and I saw the good reviews so I decided to check it out. They had a 49 dollar internet special for camera inspection and drain cleaning, but a little out of my area, so there was a 41 dollar extra charge. Appointment was immediate and Tim showed up early in the morning, did his magic and viola, everything was functional. He didn't have the camera with him so he gave me a free camera inspection coupon along with some other specials. I am more than happy for their prompt service and no hidden charges, affordable charge with everything was disclosed, like how much it will be (total was $91 as opposed to 240 dollars that Roto Rooters was giving me the estimate for) . I would highly recommend them.<//review>

<review>I am so glad I had Anderson Plumbing , Heating & Air service my air conditioner. The Technician was respectful and clean and knew his product very well.

What I really appreciated was they offered a service and did just that. I mean I was not told I needed all these extra parts or service from Quentin the tech who came to work on my air conditioner.

You really love it when you do not feel pressure nor feel you're being scammed.

Anyway love, love this company will definitely use them again.

Kind Regards

<Review>I called Anderson Plumbing because they had a discount rate for Air Conditioning check up.  I expected them to try to sell me a new one because mine is about 10 years old.  My Service Specialist was Javier. He was professional and friendly. He explained what he would do and why.  He checked out everything, and I could see that he knew what he was doing.  He checked out the unit inside and changed the filters and even vacuumed out the closet it was enclosed in.(it was really dusty)  He finished by installing a booster to the unit to get a few more years out of it.  I could tell the difference immediately!  I will continue to use this Company for all of my future needs. I felt that they are knowledgable and honest, and I will ask for Javier because he exceeded my expectations.</Review>< Resp>

Unclog main drain from property to city main line.... roots.  Called on a Sunday, technician was to our house within one hour.  Zak was professional and knew what was wrong immediately.  We have used Anderson's for our heating/air installation.   Everything has been great with this company.  From service to employees.<//Review>

<Review>We had a major problem when we got up. Anderson was able to schedule a visit within an hour of our call. The technician arrived promptly. It was complicated, but he knew exactly what to do to remove the obstruction in our sewer pipe. He cleaned up the work area and scheduled a camera inspection to see if additional work was needed.</Review>< Time>

< Review>
Im very happy with their service, we had to do a major fix and Ricardo told us the problem and showed the video of our pipes, there were roots  giving is trouble for months! (I had several plumbers coming in and this company is the only one who showed us the video)

After a week of them fixing it, the water backed up again, so I called them and they sent someone immediately and took care of the problem right away, under the lifetime warranty.

Thank you Anderson plumbing! And Ricardo the project manager.</Review>

<text>Just now wrapping up the installation of a completely new HVAC system. These guys were one of three  companies to quote us and by far the least professional,  knowledgeable, and affordable. When Paul  came and to take a look at our systen back in April for a quote,  he immediately said he had never seen one as old as ours and didn't know what to do.  Old? Yes.  Not knowing what to do even when you are the expert? Not a good thing.  His recommendation was to ask my neighbors (who just got theirs replaced) what they did and then call him back. Needless to say,  I was livid. Once pressed, he emailed me with an estimate on something he "thought" would work for over $12,000. So, beyond the horrible service and lack of professionalism, they were also really overpriced. I went with a different, extremely well rated family owned company who was literally HALF the cost; same quality system and similar warranty; and knew immediately what to do when they saw our outdated system. I can't speak to their other services, however I would strongly recommend NOT using this company for HVAC needs.</text>< Pics>

<review>Ryan was our technician, he arrived early, explained to us what the cost would be.  He had our problem fixed in a matter of minutes.  We have been searching for a plumber and heating and air company for about 6 months. I am so happy we found Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air. We will be using them for all of plumbing, heating and air.

Finding a company who cares about the service they perform these days is very rare.  Anderson is that company.<//review>< pics>

<review>Contacted Anderson Plumbing for a slab leak. Brian was the tech that came out, and he gave us a recommendation and the cost. Did a copper re-rout that led to the kitchen. A week later another copper pipe leak showed up in a different area. Requested that Brian come back out to investigate. Found a pin hole leak in the copper pipe which he spot repaired to stop the leak. Based on the two leaks we discussed a full copper re-pipe of the house. We decided to go this route as we have been spared of water damage up to this point. We requested that Brian do the work. Brian does excellent work. He plans things out, does not rush, keeps the house clean by using plastic around the work area, and makes sure we have use of some running water while replacing the old piping. At this time (because all the plumbing was being disconnected) we replaced a toilet  and some tub and shower valves. This was a big job and we appreciate Brian's dedication. If by chance some plumbing needs to be done in the future I will request Brain as the one to repair it.<//review>< pics>

Drina was excellent tech in doing HVAC checkup. She's conscientious and relentless.

Anderson's will be returning, because they were unable to resolve one problem today. One anticipates that their depth of talent will enable them to identify the right person rapidly and be able to schedule quickly, since it's a follow-up and it's taking a good bit of extra customer time.

The one surprising thing is that Anderson is retro in their communications. They rely on telephone as if it's in the 1980s. Even when requested to use email, they use very little of it. This is a costly problem for those customers who have businesses, for example, and can readily multitask with emails, but are unable to justify the various costs imposed by unnecessary phone calls. Hopefully they'll be updating this aspect of their vital customer service focus.<//text>

Ridiculously expensive, went with another company that charged us $525, Anderson Plumbing estimate was $2200, plus they tried to talk us into an annual fee of $238. The plumber could not tell us what was wrong with the toilet, he just said it needed replacing of a cost of $958.  The other company we went with replaced a $20 part. Check around!< /Review>

< Review>
Larry was very courteous, answered my questions and tried to trouble shoot the problem.    He was on time, respected my property.  What he did not do was remove the trap.  I did not ask him to but when he ran water and could not reproduce the back up of water in the sink, he might have thought of that.  I thought of it later the night and asked the next person who looked at the sink when it backed up again to do that.  We found a child's toothbrush which had obviously been in there for some time.  I am not faulting him but the next time I would definitely make sure the trap be removed from a sink that is backing up.

I also had Zak B. out for the same problem.  Again he ran water, tried to reproduce the blockage.  We went over everything that had been done the day before, we checked the clean out on the side of the building and then I asked him to remove the trap on the sink.  He did and we found a child's toothbrush in the trap.  Again if I had not asked to have it removed the problem would have recurred.  I am happy I asked but I think the technician should know to remove a trap if they can't reproduce the blockage with running water.  Something has to be causing the sink to backup several times.< /Review>

They know their stuff and their staff is most excellent, every one. We have used them for years and just threw them probably their most challenging and frustrating job ever!  We're SO sorry. They pulled it off with efficiency and were good natured and professional all the way through to the end. We wholeheartedly recommend them!</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Called Anderson Plumbing at 8:30am, was promised a plumber would be here between noon and 4:00pm.  Ricardo and Jesse arrived at 1:30pm, about 20 minutes after a phone call from the office that they were on their way.
These guys were great.  Very professional, and, with an added benefit, fun and informative.  Had a written estimate within a few minutes of their arrival after a survey of the problem.
Job was competently completed in about an hour and the job site left perfectly clean.
Will always call Anderson to work on any of our future household plumbing issues.<//text></record>

I called Anderson to have a broken disposer replaced. Calling the job in already a great experience - ''How can I make you smile today?'' just works! Scheduling was without problems and I got called 30 minutes before the technician arrived. Justin M. impressed me right away, because he listened to my problem description, then assessed the work involved, presented me with the options available. I chose, he did the rest - a sizable job as it turned out. In-between and after having finished, he warned me that, perhaps, another unrelated problem might arise in the near future. He counseled me on the work to be done, if that were the case. Justin explained everything very well. He also asked me if there were other problems and, on me mentioning one, he took care of it. The parts that he needed were on the Anderson truck - they are fully stocked as the advertisement says. Justin left the job site clean and tidy. The part that he had mentioned might be on the brink of failure actually did fail a few hours later. I called it in, the time was set and Justin took care of the rusted out part the next day, same time. No fuzz, no huff and puff, Anderson and Justin just did it. I had used this company before, and was happy, but it has gotten even better!</Text>

The technician did a good job on explaining work and cost , and and the work execution as well. He cleaned up nicely after done. However, the price was a real shock for me. Anderson charges by job, not by hourly. The job was categorized as cat 8 of 3" cleanout. The real work was replacing a fall-off 1 foot long 3" drainage pipe connector. The entire work was done just about little over 2 hours. I was charged $1149.40. I am not sure that this is a normal charge or I was just rubbed.</Text>

With sluggish drains, the fear of water backing up was a real threat. I was extremely happy when Dylan cleared our drains and scheduled a camera scope appointment, which was completed today by Miguel. And we are finally (literally) getting to the root of the problem -- roots in the drain line is the problem. Next step is a resolution. Everyone has been very professional. Thank you.</review>

Start out knowing a plumber won't be cheap and there will be some difficulty arranging for the plumber to come when it is convenient for you. Once you are past that, Anderson PHA was great! Ryan (drains) and Ken (plumber) were both courteous, friendly, professional, competent, and very loyal to Anderson PHA. A positive experience having them repair our drains and fix an outdoor faucet (and a pressure problem).< /review>

my appointment was between 8-12 and I received a phone call at 7:15 saying the tech would be here in an hour.  Ken S arrived exactly on time, wore booties in my house, explained the problem to me, and did a very professional job on repairing my toilet.  He left my bathroom as clean as it was, and told me about a coupon I could use for the service call since I am a repeat customer and happened to have one.  He was very nice and also showed me how to reconnect the chrome dishwasher vent that had become unscrewed on my kitchen counter.  It was a very good experience, and this is why I always use Anderson.< /review>

Rueban , the technician from Anderson Plumbing was very courteous and informative while inspecting our plumbing problems . He was courteous and his suggestions on our next step were professional and well appreciated ; I will use Anderson in the future and recommend the company to all my business friends.

Thank you

Mike B. repaired the air conditioner later the same day and it was a grand experience,  he was very knowledgable about the product and very pleasant to do business with. I highly recommend him him and Anderson P H & A.
Thank you again.

Let's get this out of the way first.  The service was just fine.  However like with all trades they have gotten out of wack with the Amount they charge you.  Knowing more people aren't going to tackle plumbing or electrical issues  doesn't give them the opportunity to gouge the customer.  All i needed was a trap under the sink replaced. 20 dollars maybe in materials.  Yet I got charged $372 for 15 min. job.   Shameful...again Anderson plumbing isn't the only one but would be nice if they stepped up to the plate and maybe be a step above the rest!<//Review>

< review>
I Have a 5 year old central AC system that kicks out cold air fine, but have had problems with occasional water dripping from above. CJ ( technician) arrived at the 1PM requested time and immediately began his diagnosis of the problem. Within 10 minutes he figured out the problem (which was two-fold) and began the fix. After a time on the roof to check out and adjust the system, be began the repair inside.
His cleaning of the main drain hose from the air exchanger and the hose below to the drain was completed successfully. All is now Good!

As a side note, I've been in business successfully for a number of years.  I was very impressed with my technician (CJ).  He is a remarkable individual on two levels.  He has extraordinary people skills combined with very strong technical ability.  That's an excellent combination that's difficult to find in employees today!< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>They used to be my go to company great people  but recently took an estimate from them which is $6000 more than the actual work performed by another licensed plumber. Now I wonder if I went with another company last year to do my sewer lines, I could have saved at least 4000. But I learnrf  this time to get three other estimates. Sorry Anderson you have great people. But way too expensive!

UPDATE!!! Got an email today, they reviewed the quote and dropped it from $6900 to $4951 after I posted this review.  I got other estimates a lot lower for exactly same work, with liability insurance, worksmen's comp coverage and same credentials for $1786.00 .  I really like your people Anderson Plumbing, but your company charges too much.  Last year you charge me over $7000 for sewer repairs which could have only cost me $3500 according to the company I hired to do the work recently in my home.  Thank you for having great staff but your company is OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE.< /text>< pics>

<text>So, our central house air conditioning packed up yesterday. We were very keen to have it repaired quickly so we used homeadvisor to find local contractors. Anderson arrived about 3:10 today and prepared a quote of $1811 to replace an $18 capacitor!!!  Scandalous, egregious or what?  We found a local contractor (Air Time) shortly afterwards, they arrived within less than two hours of our first contact, repaired the system in 10 minutes, and for less than 10% of the price i.e. $180. They (Air Time) were amazing. If you care about your money, do yourself a favor and call someone else.</text><response>{'time': 1532450353673, 'text': "Thank you Mr. Walley  for your review and bringing to our attention your dissatisfaction with our quote for repairs of your air conditioner. As no company wants to get a bad review, we do want to know about our clients experiences. I was able to pull Graham's service call and I found that we provided same day service, even though we were booked due to the number of calls coming in at this time. Our technician detected the issue with the system, and provided an upfront quote for repairs. Our technician actually did not quote $1811.00 for only a capacitor replacement, but along with 3 other repairs and our service fee. We are glad that the problem was fixed, however our recommendations did include other items that would keep the system running more effectively, not just a quick fix. If Graham would like to contact us and discuss the matter further or have a field manager out to go over the recommendations in more detail, we would be happy to schedule at his convenience.\nThank you,\nAnderson PHA\nErin Hanson, Client Care Manager\n619-449-3852 x445"}<//response></record></dataset><record>

Tried Anderson Plumbing, Heating, and Air for the first time. Having only one full bath, it was a bit of an emergency when the shower wouldn't drain, and dripping faucets were rapidly filling the shower stall. Technician James, attempted to clear the blockage, but only got 2 feet into the drain. After informing him of old cast iron pipes in the crawl space beneath our house, he called a camera specialist, Ricardo, to determine the problem. We needed a new trap and 10 foot length of modern-day "code" pipe. James was able to temporarily stop the dripping faucets. Unfortunately, we weren't able to schedule the fix-up for a week later.

One week later: Larry, a very knowledgeable man with plenty of on-the-job experience, and a supervisor as well, arrived about 8:30 AM (on time), fully explained all of the work that was to be done, and answered all of our questions. Then he went right to work. The beneath the house work was accomplished pretty quickly, but the new, Moen, single handle faucet kit was a bit of a challenge. Larry had to remove an area of tile, and saw through 2-inch concrete and lathe in our "vintage" shower stall. When the job was completed (by mid-afternoon), the shower drained well (with its modern, 4 inch pipe), and we had a shiny Moen faucet/plate and shower head. They were so well-installed that one couldn't tell that they were replacements. No damage to the existing tile and well-sealed.

On the same-day that James and Ricardo came out, (at different times), I was only charged $42. Ricardo prepared the cost, with options. In my opinion, the fee for the option that I chose, was fair, considering the time, labor, and parts involved. On repair day, no attempt to oversell, no surprises. My white tiled bathroom was left clean, and undamaged. Larry even wore shoe covers to protect my dark hardwood floors and oriental rugs where he had to pass through the house.

I definitely will call Anderson again for its caring, knowledgeable, experienced, professional service for plumbing repairs on my OLD house. Thank you, James, Ricardo, and Larry.< /Text>

<Review>Sorry for the duplicate, but I think I posted this on a site that feeds into Google.
WARNING! Outrageous prices. Confusing and complicated fee schedule with “up front pricing” (Stupid me, for not reading the reviews before calling them.) I discovered a slight leak from one of the toilet tank bolts. I checked online to see what needed to be done (remove tank & bolts, sandpaper the hole, replace). The cost of the bolt & gasket kit online, $8.55. Instead of DIY I called Anderson. I told the plumber there was a leak from the bolt…I guess he took a look at me and thought, “female, old, dumb”, or else the plumbers are pushed to upsell. He said, “oh no, it’s leaking from, etc….” I told him to put his finger on the left bolt and feel the water. I didn’t need or want anything else because I had just a few weeks previously changed out the “innards” of the tank. So he quoted me…$657.00! A rip-off. We hassled over the price (I really should have just asked him to leave). After “calling his manager”, the price was reduced because I didn’t need a “full tank rebuild”, which I never asked for. I still was overcharged. Less than an hour work, plus a $8.55 part. He tried to impress me that I was getting a 2-year warranty (on a $8.55 part).
Their fees are based on 9 levels, with a price for each individual item in each level. As an example, for the work I myself did previously: In level 2: toilet flapper, plus a tank trip lever. My cost $38.00 online, plus 5 minutes of work. Their level 2 pricing: Flapper $269; Trip lever $269 = $458. As I said…beware.<//Review>< name>

Michael Gaskill did a great and thorough job inspecting our HVAC system.  HIs step-by-step explanations were helpful in better understanding current problems as well as what we may see in the future.  I highly recommending asking for Michael when contacting Anderson PHA San Diego.< /Review>

Drina was a dream. She quickly identified problems with the original installation of our AC/Heating system and then took the extra time to correct them and get my system working properly. She stayed with me until we were both satisfied that all was ok and I had a handle on how to use the system and also how to use it wirelessly. Fantatic employee.<//Text>

<rating>3</rating><text>**RESOLVED** I called Anderson on 7/16 about my mother’s a/c since it was not functioning properly and not getting enough cold air upstairs. The person who answered said that there’s availability in the afternoon. I said Ok and said if I need to cancel, I will call because I initially wanted another company that I trust to fix the AC but they were booked all day and not sure if they could come the same day. Since Anderson charges $68 just to come I called to cancel the appointment but the person who answered said that they would not charge additional fee and it will go towards the repair. So I said ok, hoping they would be reasonable. The repair man named JUNIOR arrived and looked at the AC and took about 2 minutes and said the unit was “unfixable” and need to replace and it would cost about $10k-20k. My mother is in her old age and she wanted it to be fixed at least temporarily until she could replace it( add a coolant/ Freon) We could clearly see that he did not want to even try fixing and had a really bad attitude. then he said to do that there’s no guarantee and there can be a leak, etc, etc.. trying to sell a new one. Then he said it will cost $1850 to just add Freon to fix it temporarily or if you don’t want him to do that for that amount to pay $ 68 for coming. We’ve fixed our AC units in our homes and never paid more than $300-$400. This man was so unreasonable and cruel. He insisted that We pay him $68 for 2 minutes he took to look at it and try to scam my old aged mom. So we did pay $68 and let him go. We got the other company to come the same day and fix the AC with the coolant and charged only $300 and the AC is working fine. I am so angry that this man from this “reputable” company is scamming people trying to sell their AC units and giving unreasonable, unreal quotes so they rob money from people.

UPDATE: A few days later we contacted Anderson customer service and told them what happened, they refunded the $68. They agreed that it was unprofessional and not how they train their employees.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>my appointment was between 8-12 and I received a phone call at 7:15 saying the tech would be here in an hour.  Ken S arrived exactly on time, wore booties in my house, explained the problem to me, and did a very professional job on repairing my toilet.  He left my bathroom as clean as it was, and told me about a coupon I could use for the service call since I am a repeat customer and happened to have one.  He was very nice and also showed me how to reconnect the chrome dishwasher vent that had become unscrewed on my kitchen counter.  It was a very good experience, and this is why I always use Anderson.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Called for bathroom double sink back up and guy shows up. He then says he forgot the main tool in Escondido. He comes back and breaks snake cable off in the drain, but the sink "Should still work." I need to pay him $142, he leaves and I check bathroom and 1 inch of nasty smelly black water is in tub, where I set all my stuff from under the counter. I had to call him back and all my stuff was dirty. He said someone needed to come out with a camera on Friday morning. So now I can't use my master bathroom at all. New guy "specialist" comes Friday morning, never gets a tool out and tells me he doesn't need to because he knows what it needs. Off his head, with no calculator, he says it will be about $2700 because they need to cut up my walls now. I tell him he needs to write up an estimate and I will get a second opinion. Writes it up for $2400 and tells me he's "Hooking me up." I let him leave and call 2nd plumber. Guy comes and says he can't do anything with Anderson's broken parts in the line. Trying to make sure so I don't get forgot about for the weekend, I leave several messages, and I FINALLY get to talk to a manager at 4:49 on Friday night. He tells me they have no liability for breaking their cable off in my line and leaving it there. He is rude an condescending - I wish I had never heard of these people and I hope to spare someone else the same hassle.</Text><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015</GmapID>< Name>

<response>{'time': 1513976040509, 'text': 'Good afternoon Ms. Cummins,\nMy name is Erin, I am our Client Care Manager here at Anderson Plumbing Heating & Air. I first want to thank you for your review and bringing to our attention your dissatisfaction with your service. I did receive your concern from our CSR regarding we hadn\'t shown up as of 5pm last night. I was able to pull up your account and confirm via our phone recordings, that you called for service on Tuesday at 3pm, and were scheduled for service Thursday in our pm slot. Which was explained that we would arrive anytime after 12pm. You confirmed this was ok with you as we were booked at that time. I do sincerely apologize that we did not have anything sooner at that time, and that our scheduling time frames were not satisfactory. We recently changed our windows of scheduling due to our technicians were often delayed on jobs- therefore we would be late for the next clients window. We have found that giving an "am" appointment, arriving before 12pm, and a "pm" appointment arriving after 12pm enables us to not be late for appointments. We do keep our clients updated half way through the morning or afternoon, as well as call them 30-45 minutes prior to arriving. This enables our clients to go on about their day and not have to wait at home for us to arrive.\nI do see that we offered you an afterhours appointment, but that was declined due to the service fee was higher. I do wish I was made aware of this concern at that time, I would have honored our regular fee for you. We by no means want our clients sitting in a cold home waiting for service. And after listening to your explanation of the problem- I too believe it was a relatively simple fix. Also, I would like you to know that our technicians run calls 24 hours a day, and can work in the darkest of areas- Again I wish this was discussed with you before hand so maybe we could have kept your appointment last night and gotten this taken care of for you before you had to leave.\nIf  this has not been taken care of, or you have questions or further concerns- please call me directly and I will do my best to get you immediate service.\nSincerely,\nErin Hanson\nClient Care Manager\nAnderson PHA\n619-449-3852 x445\nerinh@andersonpha.com'}</response><GmapID>0x80d95825767feffd:0x9128f1cbf9c2d015<//GmapID></record>

Their techs are always clean and professional.  Our latest experience was actually 3 jobs for them that snowballed into another problem so while the bill was more than we expected the tech explained everything he needed to do and why and cleaned up after he was finished.  We have never had a bad experience with them but I would bet if we did they would try and make us happy.  The tech that we had today was Eric T. and he was awesome!!!  Again we've never had a bad experience with them but they can send Eric to my house every time if they want to.

< Review>
Our A/C died on July 2nd. Normally I wouldn't be in a rush to fix it but my wife was delivering our first child on July 7.  I called 3 other companies before contacting Anderson. 2 of those companies never returned my call and the third couldn't meet our schedule demand. I needed the AC fixed by July 6th.  Anderson stepped up and squeezed us in. Mike our tech was fast, professional, and knowledgeable.  Thanks for helping us being a new born back to a cool house. It would have been a nightmare otherwise.<//Review>

Rueban , the technician from Anderson Plumbing was very courteous and informative while inspecting our plumbing problems . He was courteous and his suggestions on our next step were professional and well appreciated ; I will use Anderson in the future and recommend the company to all my business friends.

Thank you

Mike B. repaired the air conditioner later the same day and it was a grand experience,  he was very knowledgable about the product and very pleasant to do business with. I highly recommend him him and Anderson P H & A.
Thank you again.

<text>I Have a 5 year old central AC system that kicks out cold air fine, but have had problems with occasional water dripping from above. CJ ( technician) arrived at the 1PM requested time and immediately began his diagnosis of the problem. Within 10 minutes he figured out the problem (which was two-fold) and began the fix. After a time on the roof to check out and adjust the system, be began the repair inside.
His cleaning of the main drain hose from the air exchanger and the hose below to the drain was completed successfully. All is now Good!

As a side note, I've been in business successfully for a number of years.  I was very impressed with my technician (CJ).  He is a remarkable individual on two levels.  He has extraordinary people skills combined with very strong technical ability.  That's an excellent combination that's difficult to find in employees today!</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Unfortunately , my experience was not the same as others. When the tech came out , he gave my wife three options varying in price from $3640 for refrigerant test and repair  to replacement of system for $12.087.00. A suction line they were asking $394.00 for has a cost of approximately $35.00. Further he told me and written on his proposal that the compressor was not working and needed to be replaced.

As it turned out, I did not need a compressor and our freon leak was repaired. ALL for a TOTAL of $701.00. !!!!!!< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Starting this review and will make sure to update it upon service completion.  I was truly amazed by the level of customer service I received when calling in to inquire about service for the drain line of our air unit.  The previous company was not responsive and could not answer my questions when I called, but wanted to schedule me three weeks in the future and mentioned they couldn't tell me what the problem was until they got a technician to the property.  They told me they would have a technician call me back and .....NO CALL BACK.  Within minutes of asking the same questions to Anderson, they got Robert on the phone with me.  He was able to explain the issue we were having based on the information I gave them, and they were able to get me in their schedule within a couple business days.  Great job thus far Anderson!  In a day and age of instant gratification you all should pat each other on the back for having an outstanding customer on-boarding process in place.  More to come after the service visit on Monday!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I sign up for VIP membership September 2017 and yesterday I had an emergency sewer back up problem. I called the Anderson plumbing and the lady O talked to could not even tell me a timeline when can a technician can call me beck to determine the timeline they can come over to fix my sewage back up problem. Finally one hour plus the technician called me and stated that they could not respond until 3 hours later around 5:30 PM- I said ok because it's fourth of July- but when I tried calling another plumbing company (Roto-Rooter) they were consistent with the timeline- even the representative told me that the technician will call me in 15 minutes they the technician show up in my front door and able to clear my mainline sewage by accessing my clean out in less than an hour. I called again for the Anderson plumbing to come in just to place a camera and do a Plumbers Report- at first the guy told me it's $270 and when I told him I want a report to show to the city the price went up to $490 and the first available is not until three weeks later 24July2018. What a waste of VIP membership. This place sucks with all the good reviews above failed to response when I needed the most. This should say a lot when you have to chose your next plumbing project or problems.

Thank you Mr. Roque for working with me to get this taken care of for you. We hope that your situation gets handled, please let us know if there is anything further you need.\n\nThank you Mr. Roque for your review and bringing to our attention your dissatisfaction with your call out to us. My name is Erin, I am our Client Care Manager here at Anderson PHA. I was able to pull up your account and research the details. First I would like to apologize that we were not able to get out to you sooner, we were very busy due to the Holiday, and we sincerely apologize that you had to call another company out. We are very glad I was an easy clearing for you. Our intentions are to be able to get to every client that needs us, unfortunately that isn\'t the case always.\nI also was able to get information on the estimate given for the camera and report requested. Our normal camera charge is $250.00, and an additional fee to place findings on a flash drive for your records. However, when a client needs a "Plumbers Report" there is more to just the camera-ing of the line. Because the city will not take the report from a homeowner, only a licensed plumber- our technicians have to camera the line, place the findings on a disc, write up an official findings report, take these to the city and file the report along with their form- this is why the price increased. I was also informed that the city will not do anything regarding roots in the line, corrosion or build up. There has to actually be a break, or collapse in the line for them to come out and repair/replace. If the line is able to be hydro-jetted to clear out roots or buildup- they will expect the homeowner to take care of this at their expense. I hope this gives a little more insight to your concern. I know it doesn\'t help that we were not available sooner to come out, please call me directly if you have another issue and I will work directly with a technician for you.\n\nSincerely,\nErin Hanson\nClient Care Manager\n619-449-3852\nAnderson PHA\nerinh@andersonpha.com'}< /Response>< rating>

Yes, I was "wowed"!  I was expecting 65 guests to my home last Saturday and that morning, the handle on a toilet broke.  I called Anderson PHA and they sent out a technician with just a few hours.  At first Ken thought he might need to order the part, but was able to find just the right one on his truck and repaired the toilet. very quickly.

Thank you Anderson PHA!<//Review>

Very happy with my furnace and AC system including a new state of the art thermostat!  John Baer did a 5 star job listening to my concerns and was patient with my tenacity to ensure certain issues were resolved.
Areas that could be improved:

1.  Electronic contract administration.  i.e. could not open email to print/save contract which we changed a few times and called twice for a final copy which I still haven't received.

2.  Training on new products.  i.e. a snag installing the new thermostat which didn't get resolved until the next day, but they did resolve the issue professionally and was diligent in training the customer and ensuring the software was functioning on my cell phone.

3.  Patchwork to drywall.  i.e. we relocated the thermostat and the hole from existing location was poorly done.

These are easy things for the company to fine tune in their administration/installation process.< /text>

Reggie needed to visit 5 different plumbing supply outlets to find the spud and washers needed and, in the end, worked hard to successfully repair the leaks. The only problem was an unexpected flood of tank water after he had picked up the old towels we laid down so that I had to rush to use my good towels to mop up the flood onto the hardwood floors just outside the bathroom. No permanent harm done. He did a nice job and cleaned up afterward. HIGH recommendations to Reggie and to Anderson PHA.

< Review>
The purpose of this letter is to commend the Anderson Plumbing and Support Team for the Team’s superb performance and assistance.

On “day one”, I submitted an email request to the Anderson website for a replacement of toilets in two bathrooms and a repair to an additional bathroom toilet. I received a courteous call from the Anderson Team and arranged an Anderson “on site” visit on “day two” at 8AM.

On “day two”, a few minutes before 8AM, I looked out and saw an Anderson Truck parked at the curb. Anderson’s Plumbing Service Technician, Jesse Salcido, arrived at the door exactly at 8AM. He was ready in every respect to discuss our needs and his recommendations for the replacement of the two toilets as well as the repair of a third toilet. My wife and I agreed with Jesse’s proposals. Jesse was prepared to head out and pick up the new toilets and materials and return the same day to install the toilets or to return the next day after picking up replacement toilets to do the installation work. My wife and I decided it would work best for our schedule to have the work done the next day on “day three” beginning at 9AM.

On “day three” Jesse arrived on time and completed the following efforts:
a)	Replaced both angle stops for hallway bath toilet and master bathroom toilet.
b)	Removed old toilets in both bathrooms, installed new wax ring and bolts and replaced both toilets with new Toto Drake 2 ADA
c)	Rebuilt guest bathroom toilet with new flapper and replaced toilet seat
d)	Also installed a 4” clean out cap in front yard.
Jesse worked “non-stop” and completed all the jobs listed above in less three hours. (Thinking back, I believe it was closer to two and one-half hours.)
Jesse is a professional in the finest sense of the word. He represents the “best of the best”. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and an outstanding representative of the Anderson Plumbing teams that serve all over the San Diego area.
The entire Anderson experience was a very positive experience beginning with the courteous office staff members, Brittany and Kimberly who provided a telephone response my calls confirming work dates. In  addition, I want to commend  Stephanie P  and Devin C. for the way they processed the billing for the work. One word describes Anderson Plumbing –
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Very respectfully,  Dennis</Review>

< Review>
We had a blocked toilet that we couldn't fix with a plunger or a toilet auger from Home Depot.  Turns out that a piece of plastic wrap from some cold medication fell into the toilet, and though liquids could get by, it blocked all the other fun stuff that goes down that way.  Anyway, everything turned out well.  Mitch had to remove the toilet for this, and then put it back with a new wax ring.  Not sure if this is too much information, but Anderson Plumbing wants us to review them, so here's our review.  I called them this morning, and they sent someone out early in the afternoon.  It cost us $454 for this service, including the VIP discount we had paid when they installed a new hot water heater for us.<//Review>

We set up an appointment for Anderson Heating and Air to come out to fix a leak we had coming from the overflow pvc pipes on our system.  All the service people were extremely courteous and helpful.  When the technician evaluated the issue and removed the pipes to determine the problem he gave us an estimate of $1000 to replace the pvc pipes and install a valve.  We were appalled.  He was able to get us a price of $800 which was still too high.  Since he had already removed the pipe we agreed to pay the lower cost but shared our dissatisfaction and the fact that we will never use their services again.  The cost was outrageous.  This was our first and last experience with them.< /review>

Tim was great! Not only was he very knowledgeable but he was efficient and very friendly. I love the fact that Time was able to reach past the 100 foot drain problem by putting two snakes together. This was great to see, an thinking man!

Jerrad was very professional and showed up on time every time to continue working on it until it was resolved. He continually checked in to let us know what the status was and what needed to happen next.

Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air is lucky to have him as part of their team as he is a great representation of their company. Kind, helpful and they always follow up on what they say they will.

< review>
Called Anderson because one of my neighbors recommended them and couldn’t have been more disappointed. Bernard showed up and was very nice but tried to gauge me on price. I hit my water line in my yard while I was digging and needed a small piece of copper pipe coupled. I already had the pipe dig out so all he needed to do was cut the pipe and install the coupler. He even admitted that the job would take 30-45 minutes but once he input everything into his iPad he wanted to charge me $650!  I know a Saturday call may cost a little more but it was only 3pm and for less than an hour of work and maybe $50 in parts this seems like trying to gauge someone who you know doesn’t have water right now. I told him no and he preceded to charge me $99 just to come to my home.  So if you don’t agree to their way inflated price you still get charged.

I just called a local plumber in the neighborhood and he finished the work in 30 mins and only charged $300. He was gonna charge less but I insisted on giving him that much after my experience with Anderson. Make sure you shop around before using these guys. They try to take advantage of you when you are in a tough spot without water service.<//review>

<username>Angela Campanella< /username>< review>
In my 50+ years of owning and maintaining a home, I must say that the service provided by Larry Fawcett of Anderson Plumbing was outstanding.  He patiently explained what caused the huge leak under my sink.  Both the washing machine and the sink are connected to the same cast-iron pipe.  When the pipe becomes narrowed from lint and debris, the water backs up and floods under my sink.  Quickly and efficiently, he reamed out the pipe and meticulously cleaned up after he finished.  He pointed out a potential problem and suggested a solution to avoid another leak.  I am very impressed with the efficiency, patience, and professionalism exhibited by Mr. Fawcett.</review>

<review>Mike Gaskill did an outstanding job fixing our air conditioning unit!  The previous technician (from a different company) had not been able to fix the problem.  In addition, Mike brought us with him and explained the diagnostic and repair process step by step.  We learned lots of useful information about air conditioning!  He helped us understand what our future options were and gave us useful facts to consider as we decide whether to continue maintaining our current system or to purchase a new one.  He signed us up for a very valuable maintenance plan and gave us his cell number if we ever have any questions.  I would recommend Mike Gaskill's service to anyone!  Outstanding experience!!< /review>< rate>

This is a wonderful company - they sent a person to fix an emergency very quickly, and he did a fine job.  The next day, the same person installed a new water heater - again, he did a great job.</Text>

<Time>1528143115430</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Anderson Plumbing Heating and Air we have used on numerous occasions. Dave Grollman arrived (on schedule) and assessed the possible water leak. He was very professional and came to the conclusion that there was no leak, just a bad drywall patch. He could have taken me down a far more expensive road but he investigated all options, suggested the repair and even adjusted the low water temp in one of the baths. Thanks Dave and Anderson PHA. Will be calling you soon for an A/C tune-up.

I did not have a good experience with this company. I had them out to move a gas line and repair a leak coming from one of the fixtures in the upstairs bathtub. I usually try and stay home when people are working on the house for supervision and to answer questions, but this time I couldn't. Upon arriving home after work I found a 1 ft by 2 ft hole in the bathroom ceiling that was in the room adjacent to where the gas line was being moved and I received a message saying that I could not use my bathroom shower as the pipe below had been cracked. I do realize things happen on a jobsite, but this was a bit ridiculous. And to top it off, when I reached out to the plumber for clarification, he stated it was my fault and that I would have to pay to get everything fixed. He said he would "work with me" on the price but that he is "covered and took pictures." Being in the medical field, I liken this to a surgeon repairing a ACL, but in the meantime cutting the MCL. Apparently the gas line had fallen when he cut it which caused the hole in the spare bathroom ceiling and when he was unscrewing the drain plug, he broke the pipe below. After much argument, the plumber did agree to fix the pipe that was broke but I had to supply all of the parts and the hole in the ceiling I would have to fix. Overall, if you want your house to be in worse shape after you pay $1500, call this company.

After my review for this company I noticed that they had responded with a "we do not have you in our records, please call this number." I proceeded to call this number and express my concerns with their work. After leaving a message and waiting 2 weeks, I have now determined this must be an automated message by the company and this "we do not have your records on file" is a way to make them look like they care. Bad all around!!!<//Text>

<text>Anderson replaced our water heater and they did an excellent job.  The technician (Ken) was professional and courteous, and he arrived early.  It was a difficult job, because our old water heater was rusted and heavy from years of hard water build-up, but the work was completed in a timely and efficient manner.  I'm not sure how their rates compare to other companies, but the price seemed appropriate for the amount of labor involved.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Doing DIYs'  is really satisfying if you   get your home fixes done and actually works, but this time I got frustrated because  even how hard I tried using my rigid motorized drain cleaner I failed this one . I also checked every online recommendations on how to unclogg a bathtub drain. Giving up  is not an option, but that was I just did. Get professional help my wife told me, you can't  fix everything. So we called Anderson plumbing and they sent a young technician by the name of Daylan David, who is professional in every way, he checked  the bathtub , kitchen and bathroom sink to know  what is going on. This time I asked him, if you will do it now how much time are you willing  to spend on this one .........he said an hour, with his pro snake, rags and tools.He  started his snake and in maybe less than fifteen minutes he made the bathtub drain worked again . Thank you LORD for leading us to Anderson PLUMBING and the young technician named DAYLAN DAVID for an outstanding job you guys did for us, we got our shower back.<//review></record>

These gentlemen were absolutely amazing from the moment they arrived!  They accessed the situation and found the issue right away.  As they worked on the leak, they looked further into the entire scope of things and made the appropriate repairs while having a smile on their faces and explaining in depth the problem and how they will proceed with the repairs. (in the past we had another company come out and they did not do any of this.  Hence, why we found Anderson to come out)  CJ also suggested an Air Scrubber for a cleaner environment in our home, so we purchased one and we are super happy with it!  Our AC is working the best it has ever worked...Thanks again to CJ and Jeff, you guys should be proud of your awesome work!  I will definitely recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating & Air!!!

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>I was introduced to Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air through a Groupon.  It is always a little nerve-racking using a company for the first time but it turned out there was nothing to be nervous about.  On the first visit, Service Specialist Jerrard, clearly explained the issues with my air conditioner and options for repairs.  The follow-up visit went smoothly as well.  Repairs needed were reviewed and when complete, Jerrard walked me through what was done and shared the recommended service schedule for regular maintenance.  All in all, very good experience.  Based on my experience, I highly recommend Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.</review></record>

This was my second experience with Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  I was having issues with my upstairs bathroom sinks not draining.  I tried to fix it myself, but to no avail.  I decided to call Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air because my previous experience with them was an excellent one.  I called a little later in the evening and was pleasantly surprised  that someone was there to take my call.  I was greeted with a warm, "Thank you for calling Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air, how can I make you smile today?!"  What a nice way to greet your customers!  Right away, you know that you are going to be taken care of.  I was easily able to schedule an appointment.  The first appointment offered was on a Sunday.  That is so great that they could send someone over the weekend.  I knew I wasn't going to be home on Sunday so I made the appointment for the early 8-12pm window on Monday.  Usually when a company gives you a window of time, you can usually count on them coming at the end of the time, if not much later.  This is really inconvenient when you have to take half a day off of work just to wait for a technician.  Not the case with Anderson.  I got a call at 8am saying that the tech would arrive by 9am.  And he arrived by 9am!  Larry introduced himself, shook my hand, and asked for permission to enter my house.  Before he entered, he put on his booties without being asked.  After I explained my plumbing issue to him, he clearly explained what actions he needed to do and explained in detail what the cost was going to be.  I asked Larry if he would mind if I watched so I can learn how to fix a clog in the future.  He said, "Sure" and proceeded to educate me and explain step by step what he was doing and why and how the plumbing worked.  He was happy to do it and appeared genuinely proud of the work he was doing.  Many techs want to be left alone and don't want to be bothered.  Turned out that my drain issue was a bit complex.  Larry used his industrial auger, which put my 20 ft hand auger to shame.  When that did not work, be broke out the beast auger and that fixed the issue.  Despite having to go back and forth to the van to get supplies, despite having to go up and down and stairs, inside and outside the house, Larry stayed calm and collected, didn't mind removing and putting back on his booties.  When he finished his work upstairs, he cleaned up the entirety of his work area and then some.  He sprayed down the counters and glass with cleaner and he made sure he left the bathroom area nicer than when he arrived.  He even thanked me for my help, even though I was there observing to learn from him.  Larry recapped everything that he did, explained the warranty of his work, and made some recommendations without being one bit pushy or salesy.  I was so impressed by Larry's work ethic, professionalism, integrity, and passion for his craft.  Coincidentally, that day was "National Hug a Plumber Day".  To show my appreciation, I offered Larry a tip so that he can buy lunch or whatever.  He graciously said, "No thank you, it was my pleasure to serve you, use that to take your kids out to lunch."  What a great guy!

The next day, based on Larry's recommendation, William came over with his nifty video device.  In order to make sure that there were no other issues with my pipes, William fished his video camera down into my pipes.  We were able to clearly see inside the pipes, maybe 20 feet or so.  This was displayed on the video monitor.  When he was done, William said everything looked good, there was no additional blockage.  He recommended hydrojetting (washing) of the pipes, but at this point it was not an emergency, but should be done at some point in order to avoid future clogs.  I appreciated his honesty when he could have easily tried to upsell me.

This is a testament to what a great company Anderson is.  Built upon family values, they really take the time and effort to show that they care and appreciate their customers.  If you have any plumbing, heating or air issues, I recommend Anderson without reservation!</text>

michael and matthew were excellent and represented your company with the highest level of service.  they were on time, courteous and very informative.  during the home inspection, they addressed every area of plumbing and rated it as good, in need of service, or something to watch.  they even fixed a rattling pipe by simply adjusting a valve that was not completely turned on.

I have signed up for the annual service program in great part to these 2 young men.

< review>
I had to have a complete repipe of my entire house done. Bernard and Enrique did a fantastic job!  I couldn't be happier. Bernard did the repipe and figured out the least invasive way to reroute everything. I do have to admit I was a little nervous after seeing all the walls and cieling drywall cut out of all the different rooms, but Enrique was an artist with the new drywall and you literally cannot tell anything was done. The drywall, paint and texture match perfectly.I would defintely recommend Anderson Plumbing based on the quality work that Bernard and Enrique performed. They were on time, no surprises, very professional. Anderson also provided a 20 year warranty. They really did WOW me !< /review>

<text>This is my 5th or 6th review.  I've been with Anderson's for more than a decade now.  Love those folks!  They're friendly and professional.  They contact me proactively for various service and maintenance on my systems.  They NEVER try to oversell me!  Their prices are very fair and reasonable for high quality items and even higher quality service. I get a follow up phone call after every visit.  I am a committed customer and will remain so.  If you want the best HVAC/Plumbing vendor, contact Anderson's!

6.1.18. Just wanted to add another comment about the GREAT service yesterday by Kevin and Aries for my annual A/C maintenance checkup.  As always with Anderson associates, these men were a delight to deal with.  Thank you, Gentlemen!

6.17.18.  Justin is another example of Anderson's commitment to customer service.  He came out at 0800 hrs on Father's Day for an water heater that went bad and spent all day, and I mean ALL day, replacing it with a new tankless water heater.  Great sense of humor to boot.  He's the latest in a long line of Anderson professionals who've worked with me and he was SUPERB!  I recommend him to you.  Believe me, you will be doing yourself a HUGE favor!</text>< rate>

< Review>
I needed some minor plumbing/fixture work done on my home to get it ready for a home inspection.  My typical plumber did not have availability within the time frame.  I remembered the AWSOME trucks I had seen around, and being a professional female myself, I thought I'd give them a try. Calling and scheduling the appointment was great--super professional without a long wait for service. The service charge was extremely reasonable as well. The guy arrived on time and was really nice.
Before entering the house, I showed him a water spicket that had a stripped handle on it. He said he would look at it before he left but it would be expensive (odd  I thought). One of the jobs was to have a "sticky" diverter (from bath to shower) loosened because it was gritty and difficult to manipulate.   No parts, not major work.  Problem:  the quote to have that done was $550!  Really.  $550.    I declined and showed him another bath tub  where the water stopper was not attached to the Kohler lever so the water would not drain.  He did not know how to fix the Kohler but suggested a toe tap drain.   This, I had to do because I needed it for an inspection. The charge: $330.  Really.  It took him 5 minutes.
He overheard me on the phone telling my real estate agent that the charge was too expensive and he apologized  stating that he didn't set the prices, he only enforced them.

After he left, I got a squirt bottle with vinegar and soaked and manipulated the gritty diverter.  Works just fine.  Really, Really disappointed.<//Review>

I am having Respiratory/Allergy issues which my Doctor has been dealing with. I thought I  would have to buy 3 Air Purifiers to be able to deal with breathing. I called Anderson, who I have always relied on to take care of my Plumbing & Air, and out came CJ & Nate to solve my problems. I have had a Contract with Anderson since 2007 and I have never been unsatisfied. All the way from Troung Le who made my appointment & wrote down details of my problems but also called back to tell me that he took care to write down for the technician, CJ, all that he may need to help me. I have had CJ take care of me before so I was so happy to see him pull up to my house... I felt so comfortable. I also must say everyone that has come to my house over all these years has given exceptional service. CJ also has that ability to make a customer feel "taken care of" in a special way. He is also a great mentor to those he is training. Nate is new but I can tell you that he will be yet another great addition to the company. In conclusion, thank you Anderson!!!!</review>< date>

Russel and John got tasked to correct a difficult Return Air ducting issue with a new install of a Lennox 4 ton HVAC unit in an older existing structure. The original Return ducting consisted of a single 12" round duct. The unit needed at least 1500 cfm, when it only had 600 cfm. I thought we could get another through the lower story into the mechanical room, but only a 6" was able to be installed due to framing and other mechanical systems interference. The solution,  since I did not want the exterior of the structure opened up, was to have the service tech, Russel, crawl up through a small opening in the ceiling of the outside mechanical room; upwards through a 2 story chase, in order to remove the existing 12" and cut in another 12' round to double that capacity. Both Russel and John never hesitated when evaluating the job. They jumped right in, finished in a remarkably short time, made the connections in extremely tight areas, worked cleanly and neatly. The A/C unit now produces the full 4 ton capacity with no problem. Kudos to these guys for their work and extremely positive attitudes, and know how; to be able to get a difficult remodel situation solved.
Thanks Guys.</Text>

A very rewarding experience dealing with CJ, an Anderson hvac tech. Came on time, NO high pressure upsells,and very knowledgeable in his craft. He gave us good recommendations for improvements to our system in a DIY format.. We rec'd all this for just the price of the furnace tune-up special.  In this instance Mary Jean was right, her team and CJ wowed us ...  I will definitely ask for CJ again!< /review>

I had an entire Lennox XC16 and SL280 2 stage variable HVAC system with duct work registers and a new thermostat installed under the HERO program.  Jacob B and Adrian R were my installers and I couldn't be more satisfied with their work.  The system works great and is so much more efficient than my old Rheem. They were careful with my personal possessions, cleaned up after themselves and explained all their processes as they progressed.  They did everything they could to make the install and inconvenience of a 2 day job acceptable with the least amount of disruption.  The price estimate from Erik was reasonable/competitive and I loved being able to use the HERO program.  I had estimates from other companies and chose Anderson for their exceptional service reps, equipment and installers.<//Text>

CJ came to my house to repair both ACs in downstair and upstair, because they took a long time to cool down. CJ was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He allowed me to watch what he was doing and explained what and why he was doing it. After a long investigation and analysis, it turned out that both ACs were over-charged. There were fixed after extracting the extra Freon from both ACs. He even washed the units before he left. Good job, CJ!< /Review>

<review>I contacted SDG& E about a gas smell in my foyer.  They came out and found no gas readings in the home yet checked out the system and found it was changing pressure enough to warrant a complete gas turnoff and lock.  That was on June 2nd.  That same evening I contacted Anderson Plumbing on the web and was contacted that same evening to schedule a technician to come out.

Chris B was very professional.  He and his associate went through the system thoroughly and methodically assessing the situation.  Unfortunately, with this older structure finding the problem was difficult.  But through a process of elimination, Chris was able to narrow it down to an single location and had a theory on the possible issue.  He then proceeded to let me know of the delay in completion do to the fact that he wanted to be sure and not demo my home any more by using a helium test to pinpoint the problem.

The next day the problem area was found and the repairs were down quickly.  Unable to get the County to move faster they were not able to come out on Friday to sign off on this.  The whole weekend was a "no Hot Water"  weekend.

On Monday we got the County Inspector(if you can call him that.)  He immediately treated you staff as if they we amature Craigslist Handymen.  Telling them they did the repair all wrong and used the wrong hardware and proceeded in accusing Chris of not being "qualified"  to do the work because he didn't have a certification card.  He even said this work wasn't finished,  made them change a flex line in the furnace to a hard line( not why he was here by the way) and walked out as Chris tried to explain to him where was mistaken and that he is a professional at his work.  Chris was then, after at least 15 minutes convinced the inspector that he was right.  The inspector basic conditionally approved the turn-on.  And wanted Chris to return to shut off everything later this week so he can come back out and inspect the fixes himself and the pressure reading as well.  Preposterous Crap!

Well Chris got the job done and he and his associate(sorry I for got his name) was supurb, and after six days my wife can now washer her hair.  That's all that matters.

Thanks Chris
Thanks Anderson.

<review>So my air conditioner stopped putting out cold air, at least so I thought when it wouldn't cool my house in 30 minutes on a hot, hot, humid day. I called Anderson plumbing for no other reason than I like their television commercials (especially Mary Jean), and boy was I pleasantly surprised by the service call I received. The technician, Jerrad Hortum, was extremely polite (yes, he wore shoe covers in my home), knowledgable, articulate, and competent. He diagnosed my AC condenser issues in about 20 minutes and he gave me several repair options to consider. While I know it's one of their sales slogan, Jerrad did NOT pressure me in the slightest to make an immediate decision. For that reason alone, I will absolutely call and use Anderson plumbing for my future plumbing and AC needs. (And I sure hope I get Jerrad again. He really was FANTASTIC!)<//review>< resp>

Anderson Plumbing came out to fix leaking toilet tanks in my condo. Brian wasn't happy with how the new parts were functioning so he took the extra time to perform a leak test and he re-replaced the parts. Thanks Brian!<//Review>

{'time': 1517276612163, 'text': '***RESOLVED*** We were able to reach the clients and send another technician out to the home after hours. The clients water heater is still under warranty and they have requested the parts from the manufacturer. We have suggested that the clients go through the warranty company as this will be the best way to get the water heater up to code and not cost them anything in the long run.\nWe appreciate them giving us another chance to make the situation right, and do wish them all the best. We will continue to be of service as needed.\nSincerely, Anderson PHA\n\nWe thank you Mr. Gitesatani for your review. My name is Erin, I am our Client Care Manager here at Anderson PHA. I have left you a voicemail and spoken to Mrs. Gitesatani as well.  We are extremely apologetic for the way the service call was handled and would like to speak to you as soon as it is convenient for you. I have given your wife my cell & desk number in hopes to hear from you this evening and get a supervisor out to get you hot water asap. It is never our intention to leave a home with no hot water, or upset our clients as we have you. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you very much, Erin Hanson 619-449-3852'}</Resp>
