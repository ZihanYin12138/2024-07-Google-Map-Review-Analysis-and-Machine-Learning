Great customer service but got a bit duped. I was working with one of the salesman for my over a month. I had to wait for my taxes to come in so I could pay the down payment. I had picked a car but unfortunately it got sold before I had the money. So, I found another one, even a few grand cheaper. Since I’m rebuilding my credit, this seems like maybe a better choice because of price. So, I finally got paid and take several different forms of transportation to get there(  I live in San Diego). Once the deal starts they inform me that because of the financing they have to use for me ( I have bad credit) there are all of these extra charges this particular finance company requires, it made my nice $6,000 vehicle go up to almost $9,000. On top of that the finance charge is 28%. I knew that the APR would be that high but I didn’t expect them to include almost $4,000. So now my vehicle is going to cost me almost $20 grand when it’s paid off in 4 years!!! I almost left and forgot about doing the deal but I needed a car so bad!! So, they were very nice and helpful but I definitely got taken to the cleaners!! Just be aware when buying from them....</text>

< Review>
This is the best dealership i have ever been too!! If i could rate more than 5 stars I would. David and Erik were super super helpful and patient. They are very understanding and will do the very best they can to help you get the vehicle you love. David, I got to say thank you very much for your patience, kindness, and positive energy. Erik thank you for kindness, help, and patience. I highly recommend this place they are  honest and helpful. They don’t rush you like other dealerships, i felt welcomed. All the staff are nice and welcoming I am super happy with the vehicle I purchased from them  and the pricing is perfect.</Review>

<Review>This company is fraud !!! I bought a vehicle with a pre authorization from Capital One (who i have also filed a complaint with on your company and requested that Kar Genie be removed from their list of providers) I bought a vehicle in July received my plates 2 wks later . They expire in 2 mths really? I paid the fees for a year but because stg auto didnt register the vehicle for the time they had it the registration will expire in 2 mths. I called to speak to the manager he was arrogant and tried to street slick talk me. I'm from the south side of Chicago there will be NO slicking me. And said No he would not be helping me. So as I go to all streams of social media to let you all know of my experience.BEWARE oh i almost forgot i had to buy 2 tires already not a month since i bought the vehicle. For full encounter check out podcast #myblackdollarcounts   This company is soo funny he called as if i would change my review. All I can say is that for him to post all that, why send me a check later for 117.00?<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr-UQtVx4375mDYOdimx32l4KuTuHQWh-x2pCK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>
{'time': 1596648588201, 'text': "Qiana, we discussed this over the phone already. I gave you a very crystal clear explanation as to why your tags were due so soon. I hope you can try to understand that EVERY DEALERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA operates this way and we are no different. License and registration is the responsibility of the BUYER NOT THE SELLER. That's why EVERY vehicle advertised states the price PLUS tax, title, license, registration, etc... The only difference is that if the tags on the car you are purchasing are still valid for 90 days (which yours were still valid), its not added into the financing. Either way, you would still be the one to pay for it, whether it was added to your financing or it was paid out of pocket 90+ days later, YOU have to pay for it, NOT the dealer. This is NOT FRAUD, this is DMV regulation. I'm not quite sure how else to explain this to you, Qiana. I'm sorry you are upset about this but I hope you can do a little more research to see that what I'm saying is true. I hope this doesn't stop you from shopping with us in the future. Have a blessed day."}</response>

It was a great experience over at KarGenie. I was able to get a great deal on my trade-in and the new used car that I purchased. I applied for financing online and the paperwork process went quick and smooth. I was in and out in about 1.5 hours.</Text>

<text>My expectations were low going in to this dealership because I had such a horrible experience with the last dealership I went to (KarPlus Warehouse). Not only was I met with hospitality, refreshments , and just an overall warm and inviting atmosphere at the dealership, I had an amazing experience with my salesman Cesar. He was very funny and very prompt. Not only that, he was extremely friendly and welcoming to the point that while I was talking to him, I forgot I was in the midst of buying a car- which is usually a draining and uninteresting process.

I was very upfront with Cesar - I didn’t want a cosigner, I didn’t want a high monthly payment, I had great credit but lack of history since I’m only 18 but still wanted everything in my name and only the specific car I requested. Cesar wasn’t pushy and suggestive like most salesman are, he made sure I was MORE than satisfied! This was the only dealership that would work with me and my lack of history and i an so grateful to them for that.

I drove about an hour just to come to this dealer and I was extremely impressed. I would recommend this dealer to anyone looking to purchase a well maintained used car.

Also wanted to throw out a special mention to Art and Angel. I didn’t get to meet them in person, but the days leading up to my visit, they made sure to reach out to me about the car, reassure me on the process, and make my experience going in to the dealership very smooth.

I received great customer service and I had my loan approved by the most professional personnel. I am very happy about my purchase and I can say I received the best deal around
If you're looking into purchasing a vehicle then I suggest you ask for Harry, he is a super cool person as well as a professional, made me feel comfortable and provided me with anything and everything needed!!</review>

KarGenie is amazing! I asked for details on a car I loved online and they reached out fast.
When I went to them they greeted me big a smile and all staff was very nice.
Angel and Harry very humble and down to earth. They took their time to help me out and kept me smiling and laughing throughout my visit.
Hands down one of the best experience I’ve had in a dealership.
GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!< /Text>

< Review>
I never thought I could have had the car Eric and Caesar got for me. I had my eye set on a big truck for my mom's wheelchair, but I have absolutely no credit. 0. They called and said Earl, what do we have to do to get your business?
Try me, he said.
I walked out with not the truck originally wanted but a newer, nicer, less mileage and what I actually dreamt about having but never thought I could afford.
And I got it cheaper.
Maybe we are wrong about salesman...
I know I would have been wrong about them.
Come get yours'
You know what the best part about this review is?
Its all true.< /Review>

When we arrived, our appointment was on-time. The car was exactly as advertised our sales person Allan Infante did not try to upsell us or get us interested in any other car. We negotiated. Far price. He was very easy to work with. Very highly recommend him.<//Review>< pictures>

Angel worked with us and made us feel comfortable and confident in our car buying experience. Very transparent and was able to get us a great deal on the vehicle and warranty. Felt like a winner leaving the dealership. Would definitely recommend working with him, thanks Angel! 👍🏽 👍🏽<//text>

Cesar introduced himself while I was sitting in my car not wanting to get out because I was discouraged about being denied for bad credit. He said don't worry we specialize in reestablishing your credit. Long story short I drive off with my dream car a 2016 Dodge Challenger

I went there because they had the truck that I like , when I contact the dealer the assigned Allan Infante to help us the guy was very unprofessional he left us for like 2 hours waiting in the lobby,  becuase it was more important another clients,  when he finally decided to help us he made me fill up my application I guess he was to busy to do it un very unhappy with the costumer service.. even that the next day we had to bring the truck ... Alejandro the mechanic was very nice guy , I appreciated the help but I'm gonna give a bad review for the help that we received...< /review>

< Review>
We had came to this place looking to come out with a car, unfortunately when we asked to speak to the general sales manager Mike Saseung about the pricing. As soon as he sat down he spoke to my husband and I with an attitude and turned us down before we had even started negotiations. When we had told him okay that’s fine we’ll look somewhere else he responded with “Okay fine get out then”. He then proceeded to tell us we were not customers and that we were trespassing and being very rude. The vehicle we saw online had no issues and seemed to be in perfect condition until we had actually seen it in person. Not only did it have exterior damage all around the car, but the turbo was covered with a piece of tape, not replaced. Oil was also leaking, when they had told us it was just replaced and maintenance. The other salesmen were polite and everything was fine up until we spoke to Mike. If you are looking for a vehicle, I would not recommend this place.< /Review>

<resp>{'time': 1614923715986, 'text': 'I\'m sorry you feel this way Stefany. However, I spoke to your husband on the phone prior to coming out. He asked me about the pricing. I told him that our vehicles are priced to sell, they DO NOT include taxes and fees, and they are firm. It\'s tax season. All of this info is stated on our website and this is also a recorded call that I\'ll gladly let you listen to if you\'d like. He shows up and demands a SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR DISCOUNT because this used 2015 with almost 60k miles wasn\'t in mint condition. He then proceeds to demand that every little scratch on the car be repaired and calls me rude when I tell him that it\'s completely unreasonable to expect me to discount the car AS WELL AS fix all the cosmetic issues . I show him all of the people scheduled to come look at this car and he responds with "Well we\'ll just go look somewhere else." I\'m sorry but your husband threw childish tantrum in my showroom floor, attempted talked to every customer in my building, some of which didn\'t care because they heard the entire conversation, so I asked you guys to leave as any business manager would. All of this on camera by the way. You asked for my business card, I gave it to you. You asked for the owners contact info, I gave it to you. I\'m sorry you had a bad experience, so did we. I wish you the best of luck in your search. Let me know if you change your mind about my this car, I\'ll gladly shake your hand and give you a do-over.'}</resp><GmapID>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I rarely write reviews but I wanted to share my experience.  It was a fun and easy buying a car from Kar Genie.  I found a car I was interested in on Car Gurus.  I filled out the contact form on Car Gurus and had a response within an hour.  Joe Miranda helped us out and promptly answered a few questions I had.  We arrived about 30 minutes late for our scheduled appointment.  It wasn't a problem and Joe was ready and waiting for us.  He had our vehicle up front and  ready to go for our test drive.  Joe was very easy to deal with during the test drive and purchase process.  He answered all of my questions without hesitation. It was nice to have a dealership honestly answer questions about various fees associated with purchasing a vehicle.  Everyone at the dealership was very friendly and helpful.  They made us feel very comfortable while we were there.  Joe didn't use any high pressure sales tactics.  In all of my dealings with dealerships, this was one of the best experiences I've had.  Again, I'd like to thank Joe and everyone at the dealership for making this a great shopping experience.</Text><userid>100855340314063444001<//userid><Time>1603321660419< /Time><pictures>None< /pictures><gmap_id>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac</gmap_id>< Resp>

<Text>I got my 2015 Honda Civic at this dealership. I met with a salesman named Angel Moreno. I must say, he was extremely helpful, thorough, and patient with my dad and I. I've been to a previous dealership (CA Motor Direct, Santa Ana) and not only was their customer service absolutely terrible, but so was the car I got from them. I got to test drive the car and it works BEAURIFULLY, not to mention that the price was unbeatable. I highly recommend that people shop here for their cars because the people here are nice and the car I got is excellent.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1605547083750, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the feedback and your business.'}</response><gmap_id>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac</gmap_id></record>

Such a wonderful experience. Angel the sales representative, what can I say but very professional, polite and enthusiastic. My wife and I purchased our 17 year old a 2011 Toyota Corolla today (his first car) I would definitely refer people to purchase a vehicle here at KAR GENIE and see Angel.< /Text>

Great service, quick response, the sales team was very friendly and I would definitely come back. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because they don't have contactless card reader. With most of my cards being on my phone this is a must.
Big thanks to Cesar!!!!<//Text>

I showed you a breakdown penny for penny, you didn\'t trust that the payment was accurate. You accuse me of inflating the payment with some shady back door tactic. OK, no problem. I tell you to download an auto loan calculator, there are hundreds of them in the app store and they all use the same mathematical formula. I even showed you the one I use. The numbers CAME OUT THE SAME. You still didn\'t believe it. OK, no problem. You Googled an auto loan calculator and used Google\'s auto loan calculator. The numbers CAME OUT THE SAME. You STILL didn\'t believe it. OK, no problem. I found an article online and text it to you. It was titled "How to calculate an auto loan payment in 3 easy steps". You followed the steps and the numbers, well, guess what? THEY CAME OUT THE SAME! lol. The payment is high because you have very very bad credit not because anyone was trying to lie to you. The problem is not with us being dishonest brother. There seems to be a bit of an intellectual problem with you my man. Hope you figure it out some day.

If you have to try and run game to make a sell, I’m out.

I may have “very very bad credit” but that didn’t stop the owner from desperately begging for me to go along with the sale 😉</Text>< user_name>

Stay away from these shady and dishonest people! I live 2 hours North and was interested in a 2012 Black Mazda3. Pictures online showed pictures taken in a showroom and the car had custom black rims, car looked amazing! I called Jacob the day before to make sure it was still available, he tells me “yes, but we do have other Mazda’s for sale” hmm🤔 I show up the next day right when they opened. Jacob was there and shows me the car, bait and switch!! The car was missing all four hubcaps, wait what? It has “Auction” written on the window. What happened to the custom rims?? The car at the dealership was not the same car advertised online! What an absolute waste of my time and how dishonest this dealership is!! Buyer beware!</Review>

My daughter was looking for a nice and affordable car, we looked around and we were able to find KarGenie by just driving by and I'm glad we did.
We were help by Jacob a nice and great young man that as soon as we walked into the lot we were greater not like some other dealerships that we visited that same day, he made us feel welcome and was able to convince us to drive away with a new car for my daughter, thank you Jacob.</review>

Amazing service. Angel was one of the best sales reps I've ever had while buying a car. He was attentive to my car buying needs and helped with all my questions. I will definitely buy my next car from Kargenie because of Angel. Thank you!

Update: My vehicle turned out to be a lemon and once I returned it there was nothing they can do to help me finance another one. Considering what I've gone through trying to purchase another vehicle I was sure they'd be more helpful but they werent.< /Text>

<Review>Wow! So let me tell you this. This of course is an individual experience. I went to this car dealership initially talking over the phone with one of the representatives. I was told that I would receive a car for a certain price... I also have text messages to support that***. I told them if I could receive this car for a certain price in cash because the drive was 2 hours away!. They responded with let's make that happen.Upon arriving I was told to sit down and they were bargaining me a price higher than what I was told over the phone. The thought of (sketchy car salesman) was constantly going into my head. They disregarded the messages I sent prior and further said things like "do you even know how much this car sells from other markets!?" -manager. He even tried to make me sit down to look over other cars, I guess trying to prove his sentament. While walking away "clearly bothered" one of the salesmen said "you don't want it for a higher price?"..Do yourself a favor y'all, don't come to this facility if you want to buy a car from honest people. If anyone would like I can even offer the screenshots of my message list.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1602732986995, 'text': 'Hello Noeh. I\'m sorry you had a bad experience. However, our salesman NEVER told you that your low offer was feasible. All calls are recorded and so are the text messages. We NEVER responded with "Let\'s make it happen" as you claim. I think you and I both know this. But look, it\'s ok. I\'m still willing to make you a deal but you cant make us an offer for THOUSANDS less than what they are currently selling for and get mad at us and call us liars when we don\'t say yes. The reason why I was trying to sit you down to "look over other cars" in the market was to show you what they are selling for, something I\'m sure you already know because you already did the research yourself. Look, its a Honda Civic. These cars are a dime a dozen. You don\'t have to drive 2 hours away for one but you still have to pay them dime. I was even telling you that I would give you the best deal you can find. Show me one for less and I\'ll still beat it! Pretty fair deal if you ask me. If you change your mind and want to make a reasonable offer, let me know. Still would like to earn your business.'}</Response><gmap_id>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Response>{'time': 1606842155276, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the feedback and your business.'}</Response><review>I have to tip my hat to Harry/Harout for his assistance with buying our new (to us) car.  He was pleasant, provided great conversation, and had surprisingly good product knowledge for a used car that he didn't sell brand new. The car that was sold was given a perfect bill of health from our Mercedes specialist mechanic who mentioned that it is the cleanest used example he's ever seen. The process of buying was painless, and Harry was able to facilitate delivery to our home in Upland, where we signed all papers and conducted the final transaction. This is a smooth operation, just make sure you take your time to negotiate and arrive at the deal you want. Standard asking price has some room for negotiation - take your time to work a good deal, and you'll leave with a fantastic car. I give extra points for facilitating delivery at home (a big deal for my significant other due to COVID paranoia their part)... overall, I give them extra credit for their adaptability and willingness to go the extra mile to get a mutually beneficial deal made. Good job, guys!<//review></record>

At KarGenie not only did they help me find the vehicle I was looking for, but got a great deal compared to other known dealerships. Service was great and got in and out with a ease. Do yourself a favor, if your looking for a vehicle KarGenie is the place. Thanks KarGenie.</review>< pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I want to personally thank Angel Moreno for helping me purchase and finance my first car! I came in after looking at CarFax, and I went to three other car dealerships today looking for a car. The people weren't as friendly and quite honestly made me feel like they were trying way to hard to get me to buy one of their cars, whereas Angel made me feel like he was helping me find the best car for me.

Big thanks to Angel, and his manager (I believe) who was named Sam for their care and effort put into helping me get back off my feet and back into a car. I would highly recommend them for their friendliness and financing flexibility, as well as the cleanliness of the site. Great experience!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

had bad experience with this company.  firstly, their cars are in poor condition and very dirty.  They will sell you a car without even a vacuum salon.  In place of this, they will say good words to you and smile, and they will laugh behind your back.  Secondly, they will try to sell you the protective systems you do not need at a cost of $ 1000 !!!  Read the description below, they don't even hide it.  I understand that the company wants a profit.  But in my opinion this is just the imposition of something you do not need for an additional fee.  It would be better if they put their cars in order.  And in the third and worst, even if they make an appointment for you, you can easily come, but you will not be warned and at the door they will say that the car is sold.  Of course, the main thing is to sell the car, the main thing is definitely not the service.  In general, be attentive, managers in white shirts will smile at you, offer water or coffee.  It's all just to create an elusion of the alleged service.  Instead, to any cost of the car, you will additionally add the price for their security system at a cost of almost 1k.  By the way, you can check it yourself, I have not seen this from other dealers.  I daresay if they are unable to vacuum from the dog hair, I doubt they even check anything.  In general, be careful.  I really do not recommend buying a car here.</review>

THIS PLACE IS THE WORSE PLACE TO GO BUY A USED CAR!!!!! I had the worse experience I have ever had purchasing a car.  I was there for over 4 Hrs and when i finally said yes ill take the deal they then said there is one issue.."we have to keep the car and you will get it tomorrow" they said the car needed a smog. I said ok that was fine, the next day came and no one called me to give me an update. I had to call them and they would just text instead. I worked with Angel, Jacob and Pouya the sales Manager.  Kept getting the run around. I ended up getting a car a week later after I had to call every day to check the status. I got the run around every time!! They lie and are quick to take your $. When i finally picked up the car it did not have the stocked speakers that they said they would put back in, which we had agreed on! the car had no speakers! when I brought it up some other guy MIKE came out talking about oh i will have my friends at the stereo shop call you for a discount , never got the call. When i called to ask for him never got a call back! I had also given a hold deposit of $250.00 and have not received it back they said the accounting department was working on the refund. I would not recommend this place to anyone! its all lies .so unprofessional< /text>

Stay away! They use bait and switch tactics, they try to lure  you with supposedly low interest rates by asking you to fill a form and without your permission they do a hard inquiry on your credit report. I clearly stated and I would not go ahead with filling that form if there would be a hard pull on my credit report and I was promised that it would not be a hard pull. These crooks did a hard inquiry without my permission. I have asked for the manager and they didn't get back< /review>

<review>Just a warning for any unsuspecting used car buyers these guys are SHADY..

They listed a vehicle at $17500. I asked for a quote knkwing there would be sales tax and some fees and it comes to over $21000. Now you're gonna pay sales tax and some dmv fees, maybe even a couple hundred for documentation, but That's OVER $2000 in dealer fees.

I pointed out the fact that $2000 in dealer fees is not gonna fly.

The salesmen then listed: $395 for window tint, $395 for LoJack and $295 for door guards. Stereotypical used car salesmen. See the attached screenshot.

This vehicle was tinted by the manufacturer. What used car dealer installs Lojack and what even are door guards???

Just advertise the actual price guys.< /review>< Date>

I'm a difficult car buyer and want the world.  These guys took it in stride and treated me well from the beginning.  I had a great experience, the car was cleaner than expected and the experience was positive.  I will make a return trip for my next used car from this dealer.  Low pressure sales, no BS games, used their financing with very competitive rates, just solid and got exactly what they advertised.</Text>

Had a great experience at Kar Genie today!!! Was able to finance my Audi with no credit and a first time buyer thanks to the help of Christopher Rodriguez. He really understands you as a buyer is very honest. He treats people with respect and is an honest man.< /text>

Was driving city at low speeds & “Check Hybrid System” popped up on dash.. After further investigating I got a P0A80 code & it’s a bad battery. And further proves my point of their inventory not being properly inspected or serviced... I cannot believe this AT ALL CAR ONLY HAS 82,000 and purchased in February this year. I’m so disappointed & will now have to spend over $2000 to replace the hybrid battery. Worst car purchase experience I’ve ever had!!!

Salesmen say anything to sell you a car!

Allan mentioned that they changed everything that has 70% or less in wear and tear items (Brakes, tires, suspension etc) After inspecting the car brake padslooked like sand paper rotors were warped, tires were cracked, all wiper blades were trash, cabin & air filter were filled with dirt which lead the car to smell like mold & spark plugs were fouled. Also I purchased this car in February 2020. Allan said they would honor the first year registration fee , since they expire in June 2020. Now they are saying that they only honor it when they are 2 months from expiring. So just please don’t take their word for it, do your own due diligence!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

It was a nice, swift experience. Called to check availability i was there in an hour, test drove and finished the whole process in an hour. Angel was great and very open with all the details. They have a great selection of cars. It was a very good experience for purchasing a car. i hablan español. I bought a Prius, it was in great shape and at a good price. MD< /Review>

I came in to look at a car and knew I wanted to leave with it. I’m gone through a LOT over the last few years so I knew it would be a long shot. Will and Pouya were SO helpful in making sure I got the car I wanted at a price that fit my budget. I didn’t  feel the pressure to buy like most car places and felt they really worked with me to get exactly what I wanted.<//review>

<text>UPDATE: 8/4/2020

After everything that has occurred, the dealership was willing to work with me and sort out the issues and get me into a safe vehicle with pretty fair terms.

Thank you, Mike, for helping me sort through the problems and for ensuring I was a happy customer.

Giving four stars instead of the one for upholding to integrity and customer service.

Structural Damage!!!!

UPDATE: 8/2/2020
I found out that my insurance company is not willing to cover vehicles with damage like mine after being notified by them after we spoke "rhetorically". With my insurance not being willing to cover a vehicle like this, the bank loan is probably going to be affected, and I'm just in a whole mess.
The authorized dealer that did my inspection reported the damage which will probably end up changing the title of the car which is a whole other mess.
I told my lawyer that id be willing to try and work things out with the dealer if they are willing to work things out with me. The problem at this point is that I've been put in an impossible situation. I've lost countless hours, thousands of dollars, time at work, time at school, and have been beyond stressed trying to sort this mess out.

So. After speaking to the dealer, they offered me to switch vehicles. Okay. Fine and dandy. But I wanted reimbursement for the work I put into the messed up vehicle they gave me. I'd only had the vehicle for 3 weeks and literally one day after I drove it off the lot had to get new tires (they had different tire sizes on it), and had to get the oil change. They said, "we don't know. We have to work the numbers."

So I'm here trying to work things out with them despite my lawyer telling me to fight, and obviously they're still trying to make the most money they can out of me despite all of the losses I've had. I will update my review after the situation is either unwinded or not.

Previous Review:
Highly do not recommend this place.

I've had my vehicle for two weeks and took it into an authorized dealership to get an oil change (because they lied and told me they did the oil change and they didnt.)

The technician and manager of the place I took my car to brought me into the back and told me that they had serious concerns. The car has severe structural damage underneath and it has to be fixed for my safety. They said that the person that tried to fix it welded the parts incorrectly to make a "quick fix it" type thing and that essentially it was all done very wrong and that the damage was severe and was a safety concern.

At Kargenie, when I purchased the vehicle, there was no point in time that they stated to me that the car had structural damage. I ASKED them straight forward and they said that the carfax is clean and reports are clean and that the car has no issues. Trust me, I would NEVER pay as much money as I did for a car with structural damage if they would have actually told me. No one in their right mind would have done that.

Think about this for a moment: if the owner of this dealership is okay with me driving a car that I paid over $20k for off the lot, knowing very well that it could be an issue to my safety, and didn't care about that. Imagine what else they would do to sell to you.

I would recommend that you do not purchase a vehicle here. It is unfortunate, sad, but the truth. Your safety and well being is a lot more important.</text><Rating>4</Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><gmapID>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac</gmapID>< user_name>

<text>Wouldn’t recommend going to Kar Genie unless you want them to waste your time. Talked to a salesman named Angel and scheduled an appointment to look at a car I was most definitely going to buy , and after driving over 160 miles to see it he was on his day off. I ended up talking to another salesman named Santiago and he was ok at first until it came down to talking numbers. After test driving the car, He was supposed to call me to negotiate after my family and I had lunch after and never called. I ended up calling him to see about negotiating and he said he would get back to me and never did. Total waste of time. Definitely do not recommend< /text></record></dataset><record>

Buyers Beware - Bait and Switch
Spoke to Angel on the phone and he confirmed vehicle was available. I confirmed there was not going to be further fees as they have in small print below all vehicles that -
"All advertised prices exclude $495 Theft Patrol antitheft device, $395 3Mﾮ Door Guard, any Aftermarket Wheels, Lift Kits, Lowering Kits, Tint, Accessories, government fees and taxes, any finance charges, any dealer document preparation charge, and any emission testing charge."

Angel confirmed that this vehicle does not have these fees and that statement is only for a select few vehicles. I drove an hour to check out the vehicle. I Liked what I saw, test drove it, and we both went into the "dreaded office" where the games begin.

Going back to before the test drive, Angel made sure to let me know that their biggest problem as a dealership is selling the car before the customer can test drive or purchase (LOL -  this is the set up for the bait & switch. Don't let them fool you into thinking they sell 12 cars a day).
So now we're in the office talking numbers and he brings his offer to the "boss." Angel then comes back in the room and asked me to switch rooms because the cleaning lady has to clean his office (LOL, really????). So now I'm in a different office and Mike the sales manager comes in and says "So the vehicle you want to purchase was just sold - someone in the next room just put a full offer on it." Now I'm just laughing inside because it is all very clear what is happening at this point. Mike goes on to mention he wants to sell me a car. He might have a "similar" vehicle on his lot but he needs to check (because the lot is so big he has no idea what he has for inventory (sarcasm) LOL). He checks and wow he has a similar vehicle he can sell me right now. A MIRACLE.... Really?

Long story short these guys are complete scammers. They will be reported to BBB and any other site I can find to help other potential customers avoid their pitiful attempts to cheat and scam people.</Text>
<pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1596038925872, 'text': 'I\'m sorry you feel this way Mike. You were given a fair opportunity to purchase the vehicle just like the other customer that showed up a few minutes after you. You were advised that another customer was here to look at that same car and you even watched as they drove off for a test drive. While you were busy asking for a RIDICULOUS discount on a $6000 car, the other customer simply told us he wanted the vehicle and paid the asking price in cash.  You even walked by the office where they were sitting as they were counting the cash. Despite the fact that this car was priced AGRESSIVELY cheap, it seems your greed got the best of you. The fact that you call this a bait and switch is rather laughable, Mike. Come on lol. We both know what really happened. Two young men made a gentleman\'s deal on a great car and Im happy for them.\n\nBy the way, thank you for highlighting my disclosure about our added accessories. You\'re right it\'s listed right below the car features and its the very first sentence you see. I gotta say, it\'s rather odd that you call that a scam when its listed RIGHT THERE and its the very first sentence you see. Lol. Isnt a scam something that I would try to sneak in unethically to steal money from people? I don\'t know, maybe we have different definitions. Also, we offer a 2 day no-questions-asked return policy in case you simply just change your mind. That doesnt seem very "scammy" to me, Mike.\n\nLook, we get in A LOT of inventory on a regular basis. Mustangs like the one you wanted come in all the time. Tell you what, when I get another one, I\'ll reach out to you and lets make gentleman\'s deal ok Mike? I still wanna earn your business but most of all your trust. I\'m not a big big dealership. I run an honest business and my success depends entirely upon building healthy relationships. Just read all of my great reviews, they\'ll tell you. Especially during these troubling times, leaving a bad review for a business simply because you didn\'t get your way just really isnt cool man. You even went to the BBB, lol! But hey, to each their own. I still want to earn your business. Hope to talk to you soon, Mike. Til then, stay safe, stay healthy, and God bless!'}</Response><gmapID>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac<//gmapID></record>

<Date>1584736006862<//Date><text>Manny unfortunately didn't really seem very knowledgeable about the car or the services offered by this dealership. Though he does seem to be a nice guy, it felt like I needed to keep checking things to make sure I wasn't getting screwed.

They didn't tell me about the structural damage to the car until the very end, though I had asked about damages. (Use CarFax, it's really worth it. Don't make the mistake of trusting any dealer like I did.)

The car was dirty and had duct tape residue on the outside of the car. Manny assured me that it would all be cleaned. The vehicle was taken out of my sight for a little over an hour... but then nothing was cleaned. What were they doing with the car? I have no idea.

They also are pushing Portfolio Protection really hard. It's not really clear what is covered by this "warranty" as the actual documentation on what is NOT covered appears to be... most things..? It's a couple thousand dollars to purchase.

I was able to get them to knock off the almost $500 charge on tinting the windows of the car by pointing out that they didn't include any means to charge the plugin hybrid I was purchasing. (Charge kit or anything like that.)

To end it all, both Eli and Manny cornered me in the sales office asking me to give a good rating on Google. They said that they didn't like asking me to do this, but the implication was that I wouldn't be able to leave until I did so. To be clear, they didn't say I HAD to do it, they were just blocking the door to the office and not letting me change topics that I wanted to wait until the transaction was complete. I gave them a 5 star rating, but that wasn't enough. Eli came back to tell me it needed text. Keep that in mind when you're checking the reviews here that are 5 stars. It's always irritated the hell out of me when people beg for reviews before the completion of the purchase, I've knocked off a star for that.</text>< Response>

I’m mad that you actually have to at least give them one star. Just bought a car with kargenie within a week of having the car the check engine light came on.  I went to the dealership they said that they would have somebody from service call me and that didn’t happen. Then I’ve been calling them almost everyday since then. I took the car to ford for a diagnosis and they told me that my cylinders were flooded with coolant , that there was no way it would’ve passed a smog test and that I need to take the car back to wherever I got it. Everybody keeps giving me the run around And all I want is my money back. At this point I wouldn’t even want another car from them. Bought  the car June 5, 2020 and am still waiting til this day for a response or something from this dealership. How is it ok to sell messed up cars and then ghost your customer.< /review>

After visiting several dealerships and being told I couldn't get financing for a BMW, Jessie at Kar Genie made me a very happy girl! I'm driving home in my 2011 BMW 328i Coupe. Thank you Jessie!👍

*Update* Still love my car but hate the dealership. I am embarrassed to say, I have been seriously ripped off by the "optional products" that were added on to my sales contract. I accept responsibility for not reading everything that was put in front of me to sign by the salesman, but $3,000 worth of useless products that weren't installed or activated isn't just shady...it's disgusting.  Also, after I complained to the salesman, he told me to bring the car back, other people were interested in buying it. I would have to pay them a contract cancelation fee of several hundred dollars though. A few days later, I received a text message from my salesman telling me to bring the car back or they would have it repossessed. At that point, the loan had already been funded. They had their money and no reason to threaten repossession. BTW, I emailed the owner, Tony Bacily twice about my purchase, I never received a response from him.< /review>

<review>I bought my car from kargenie dealership. The salesman that took care of me was William and he was very good at what he does.i would recommend him for salesman  of the month. Really if I had to grade him from 1 to 10 he would be a 10. So please dont let him get away cuz he's a great salesman.

Came to kargenie expecting to get turned down since my credit is not all that great , but working with Allan he made it happen I'm driving off the lot with the SUV of my choice! So if your looking for a your next car come to KarGenie and ask for Allan he will work with you and make it happen! Thank you Allen</text>

Brought in my recently replaced old gold crown for a estimate.  Based on research, my expectation was about $40 for 10 carat scrap gold.  Jessica reported that the crown was 14 carat gold and told me that Cashco jeweler said that they could buy my gold crown for $80!  Sold!  No hassle.  Jessica was pleasant, polite, and professional.  Recommended.<//text>

<user>101720241489257072928</user><Review>I was referred to Cashco Pawn from a friend (Audrey Jacobs!), and was very pleased with the experience. Moris contacted me right away and we scheduled an appointment the next day. His staff greeted me with a friendly can-do attitude, and I was treated with courtesy and respect.

This was my first time in a pawn shop, so I was pleasantly surprised by the layout, quality of the merchandise and selection at hand. I felt as if I were browsing a quality consignment shop.

The personal attention and the prices Moris offered me for the items I wanted to sell made me feel as if I were a valued customer, though this was my first time! I highly recommend this business and will visit again - to both sell and buy. Thank you Cashco Pawn!<//Review>< Pics>

Kristina is always friendly and professional. She is very knowledgable of their inventory. Today I accidentally locked my keys in my truck and my phone was in my truck so Kristina assisted me in calling my roadside service. Excellent customer service.<//Review>

WASTED MY TIME!!

I called them before making a 35 minute drive to them just to verify what they were charging per gram for their 10k and 14k Gold Miami Cuban Link Chains. One of their employees told me a prices over the phone which intrigued me to go take a look in person. When I arrived about 40 minutes after our conversation over the phone, the rep I spoke to had already left for the day. The gentleman that attended me was trying to charge more than 2X more what they originally told me over the phone. Even after I explained what I was quoted over the phone he did not want to honor the price. Literally more expensive then buying brand new jewelry online! Over priced and unprofessional staff. I will not be coming back here, and I highly encourage others to check out other pawn shops first or online stores.< /review>

<review>I can’t even really express how thankful I am for the help that Christine and the owner who I had originally thought was a manager at this location was able to help us. This morning our power went out and being a contractor I don’t get paid from certain jobs until the owner of any given project submits their payment(s) sometimes takes anywhere between 2 to 3 weeks I was able to pawn one of my sprayers and get enough to be able to pay the balance owed to SDG&E and get the power back on. We’ve pawned little things with Cash co before but Today their help tremendous and greatly appreciated we will definitely be paying them back and getting our equipment out but not only that would like to do something special for the owner as well. We appreciate all your help and thank you!</review>< Pics>

I'M a gambler part time. No gamblers anonymous here. 15 years in. Remember the saying " easy come, easy go".  I've use a lot of pawn shops over the years and l like the easy interaction with the staff. No judgement. They have a friendly attitude with a sense of humor. If I do get lucky at the University (casino) they have great sales on jewelry.</Text>

I read great reviews about this place. Unfortunately this was not My experience. The tablet I brought in, she said she’d never heard of. Told me it sells new for $30. They must get their price ranges from eBay. I know it Sells new on amazon for $60. I know this because that’s exactly what I paid for it & it’s only a couple months old. She did however offer me a loan of $5.00. NO THANKS!
Definitely won’t recommend this place to anyone.</text>

Lillian Contreras is my G, it’s not easy to get rid of memories and what better if you get $$$ for it. It took me 15 minutes to go in and come out. She was friendly, polite and professional. Her service is greatly appreciated and her manners were over the top. Customer service to the teeth. If you ever need to go their ask for Lilian she was great and very fair in pricing</review>

Today was my first time at CashCo Pawn. The customer service wasn't what I expected. The gentleman who helped me actually listened to my story and engaged in conversation as if he could truly relate to my situation. I was given the best deal along with clear information on the details of my pawn. Thank you so much. If you are reading this and debating where to go, I promise you will not be disappointed.  Head over to CashCo.<//review>

**UPDATE**
Willy, the manager at CashCo. Pawn is awesome! They were able to locate my charger, but not my case...however, he did give me a gift card to purchase a new case. Excellent customer service and the only reason I'll return.

Truly upset and disappointed by my most recent experience at CashCo. Pawn Shop. In December, I was struggling to pay bills, so I got a loan on my laptop (case and charger included) to alleviate some of that hardship. I actually had misplaced my charger for my laptop, and in order to pawn a laptop, you're required to have the charger...so I purchased a new charger to be able to get my loan. Everything seemed to go smoothly, and I left the pawn shop without my laptop, case, and charger, but with money in hand. Flash forward to today when I went to pick my stuff up...the lady at the counter was extremely nice and helpful. I paid my dues, and she retrieved my property. Immediately upon receiving my property I noticed 2 things:  1)  There was no charger included with my property, and 2) The laptop bag they returned to me isn't even my bag. The nice lady called her manager, William, over. He was very kind and respectful and told me this is not the first time this has happened with the employee who pawned my property.  He gave me another charger to take home tonight, along with the incorrect bag (which I feel must belong to  someone else), and told me that they are having a meeting tomorrow morning, and that he would not let that employee leave until he located my bag and charger. No compensation was offered for their mistake, and the manager assured me he would call me in the morning. The customer service at this location is amazing, but I give it one star because they lost my property, and when I entered into the agreement with them, they expected certain things from me (i.e. interest), and in return, I expected to receive  my property. I will update this review pending a positive outcome. I am beyond disappointed.</Text>

I have been a client of CashCo Pawn for over a year now ...

I must say positively they are most definitely the absolute best, amazing, awesomely blessed people I have ever met in a Pawn Shop ...

From day #1 ... Ms. Kristina has continuously been the most polite, friendly, kind and caring person I've had the pleasure of meeting ...

Also Mr. Edward, Ms. Reina, Ms. Yolanda and ALL of the wonderful employees there always are as friendly and outgoing as well!!

If you are looking for a Pawn Shop ...
Look NO further ...
I HIGHLY recommend CashCo Pawn Shop 100%+++!!!
Guaranteed you will not be disappointed.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all of the wonderfully awesomely blessed people at CashCo Pawn Shop ...

May God continue to bless each and everyone of you ...

Thank you so very much for everything ...
You are ALL appreciated more than you know!!

I've been to many pawn shops in S.D. and so far this one tops them all.. especially the great customer service I received from their employee Kristina Middleton. She gave me her card, and said I can always ask for her if I have questions regarding my loan. That's never happened anywhere else. I'll stick with cashco for that reason! Thanks you guys!<//text>

<Text>I’m not too big on pawn shops so when I first went to CashCo I was a little hesitant but I was helped by Christina and she was awesome ! We were talking about my jewelry and I told her about some hoops I had and I thought the jeweler took advantage and had me pay too much for my earrings and she offered me to bring them in whenever and they could let me know what they were worth . Which made me feel good. She also said that they themselves make customized jewelry which I had no idea ! I went again yesterday and saw Christina which made me happy because I like dealing with familiar faces 😊 She has just finished up with a customer and I asked could I come to her and she said Sure ! No wait at all 😊 she even remembered me from months before which I felt was great customer service skills because I know they probably see people all day! I had a great experience with Christina both times and I’ve also come to learn CashCo has special loan rates for military families which was also awesome! This is my go to pawn shop now 😊<//Text><user_name>breanna Foderingham< /user_name>< Response>

Just wanted to say how friendly, honest and fast the service was. You will not be disappointed. While you are there you will find yourself looking at what they have in stock that is for sale. Items that are up to date and at a shockingly low price< /Text>

<review>This review is for the lovely Veronica J at Cash Co on University Ave. I would like to thank her for being so helpful and recommend asking for her when visiting Cash Co. I was recently very worried about a financial hardship I had experienced, and I needed a certain amount of money loaned to me. After going to other places and seeing how much they were offering me for my jewelry, no one compared to what she was able to do for me. Initially she offered me x amount, but after she noticed that it wasn’t what I was I hoping for / needed, she asked me how much I really needed and she made it happen after speaking with her manager. Overall her customer service and attention to detail was amazing. Thank you for understanding my needs and for being so helpful. You understood my situation and you have no idea how much you really helped me out. Everyone should definitely consider cash co before anyone else. Cheers !< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>I love this place! I brought my mom to shop for some earrings and we ended up finding much more. Yohana was the one that helped us, and her customer service was just beyond good! She was never pushy like most sales people. She was patient, informative, and genuine with all her answers! Would highly recommend to come here, and please ask for Yohana as she loves what she does and does not mind helping out the customers!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Cashco is the BEST!!!!!!!! I highly recommend them for a variety of reasons. They are a one stop shop! They buy and loan on gold, platinum, diamonds, watcheS, electronics, tools, musical instruments, designer bags and more! They also sell those items! I love the jewelry because after all DIAMONDS are a girl’s best friend! They have a jeweler onsite too! All the staff are super nice and always professional! I can’t wait to get my holiday shopping started here!!!

Today I happened to find a piece of Dodgers Mike Piazza memorabilia that I knew my Dad would LOVE to add to his collection. After getting a great deal from Moris and the look on my father’s face when I gave it to him I can say today was a great CashCo kinda day!!! Thank you Moris and the Cashco Pawn crew for making our day better!! I look forward to coming back soon!!!</text><userid>103680261681527254306</userid>< gmap_id>

Came here to unload some history (jewelry from ex bf's). This was maybe the third time I've been to a pawn shop as a seller and I had read positive reviews about this one so each time I have had a good experience. This time though, the employee who took care of me, Alfredo, was fantastic. He explained the process and options in lay man's terms. And gave me a great deal more than expected.
I hear he is known as the money man or the deal Maker or something like that.
Anyhow, totally cool guy with great willingness to help. And he loves getting his picture taken lol😉
Thanks Cash Co!</review>

CashCo’s amazing customer service and extremely knowledgeable staff is another.  They have a wide knowledge of SWISS watches, high end handbags and fine name brand designer jewelry ! Whenever I need a quick same day cash loan I will bring one of my fine swiss watches to CashCo for a loan. CashCo’s staff is well trained to authenticate and evaluate Movado , Tag , Cartier ,  Breitling , Rolex and many swiss high end watches I’ve never seen before.   CashCo should be your one stop Pawn shop for quick cash or the best deal on designer jewelry.

They break your stuff and then ghost you so they don't have to pay you back. If there was a zero star I would give rate it as that, even a one star is too much.

<review>CashCo is simply the best: best customer service, best deals, best offers, you name it. My mom and I went over today to pay for a necklace we had loaned and bought a pair of earings for a great price (currently an on going promotion). Alfredo was a great help with assisting my mom pick out her earings and also helped me get my necklace back without a hassle. Alfredo's customer service is impeccable and I applaud him for that! CashCo never fails to make you feel at home and welcomed! Thank you Alfredo!

p.s. Thanks Abby for the candies and raffle tickets!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

You're doing yourself a big favor for coming to cashco I found that out when I met Yohana. Every time I come into the store the associates that work there greet you with kindness and respect especially Yohana.
I recommend using cashco and the associate Yohana every time you need to either need cash diamond jewelry gold tools pretty much everything you can ask for with a great smile friendly and respectfully.....< /Review>

< review>
I had some severe unexpected expenses this month, and I found myself needing to make some additional money happen. As a musician, I have several assets lying around, and as much as I hate parting with my prized possessions, I had to do what needed to be done. This is usually where I have to suffer the indignities of a pawn shop: pedantic appraisals of my professional equipment, insulting low-ball offers, ignorant statements about my equipment, and condescending attitudes from the moment I walk in to the moment I leave. I couldn’t have been more pleasantly surprised than I was with Cashco Pawn.

Not only was I offered about exactly what I’d asked for for my professional gear, but the service was friendly, professional, and even enjoyable. The fact that I was laughing and having a good time with the shop employees could not differ more from every single experience I have ever had in a pawn shop. I worked with Kristina Middleton, and she was an absolute pleasure to work with, making the experience as painless and even humorous as possible. The entire vibe of the place is one of working with you and looking to earn your continued business. As far as I’m concerned, there is no other pawn shop I’ll do business with in San Diego than Cashco Pawn.< /review>

Everybody here so so nice. Love the environment when u just first enter this place. Pawn..my brand new laptop for some quick prize and they gave us a fair prize. Beside this dude try to give us 50 bucks for it. Rayna and Eduardo are so so nice. Especially Rayna is so sweet nice and very helpful. They're the best. So pls I reccomend this place. Also it's my first time ever do this and I'm so happy I came to this place. So 5stars it is.</text>

Best Pawn in CA! I am not from San Diego but I will not shop from anyother place exept CashCo.  In person or on the web but I make my purchase there only.  The customer service is EXCEPTIONAL. All staff memebers are courteous and attentive specially Elizabeth.  She always greets you with a smile and I can tell her first priority is costumer satisfaction.  She always privides a high quality and ethical service!!!< /Text>

<date>1545080534972<//date><review>I'm a camera lens collector and enthusiast, with well over 100 lenses and out of all of these maybe 5 or 6 of them are considered "modern" or built in the last 15 years or so, with only half of those having autofocus. So the rest are considered "vintage" but even the newer manual lenses(some of which are in production today) are considered "worthless" to pawn shops. I shoot manual and value the mechanical fortitude and high quality glass that lenses used to have, and I know I'm not alone with a huge resurgence in popularity due to mirrorless cameras. This was one of the few shops that even gave me an offer - for starters my crown jewel is my SMC/Super Takumar(aka Pentax) collection: f3.5:28mm, f2:35mm, f3.5:35mm, f1.4:50mm, auto f2:55mm, f2:55mm, f1.8:55mm, f1.9:85mm, f3.5:135mm, f4:200mm and if anyone knows anything about these its that they sell easy due to their high build & image quality. Same with Nikkor, same with Zeiss, same with Meyer-Optik - they're all legendary and sell easily, so not worthless. I had to of had 20 lenses that would easily sell for $100 and then a lens like an 85mm f1.9 or 35mm f2? Closer to $200-300. Well I had to hand over 35 or so lenses, my audio interface and my Tascam DR22 for a loan of... $185. It started off well: as he looked at them he was nodding his head before he said "wait how old are these" and I said "why?" To which he said "because they look new." Screw mount Super Takumar's were made in the 60s and 70s. Out of a bunch of different pawn shops I was able to get a loan here, was given an offer after the manager had even said no - the guy helping me saw they were worth something, especially to me and I at least appreciate that (as well as it being a zero interest first time loan). If I had been given even 25% value I'd say 5 star but I was loaned maybe 5% (if that) of their value so 4 star.</review>< user>

Everything seems fair. I didnt feel ripped off nor better paid for my items pawned...the customer service was 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍. Altho she did offer me a great deal..giving me the same amount for pawn as if I was to sell it.
The wait time was fast. Atmosphere was clean and organized. I was greeted as soon as I stood in line. The process was pretty quick. She answered all my questions and explained everything clearly that i needed to know. Ive been to many pawn shops around San Diego and I recommend Cash Co.
Before any other pawnshop. 😊< /text>

This place is a scam. They offered me $10 dollars for a $200 dollar drill with charger and extra battery. I went to the other pawn shop few streets down and they offered me $40 dollars. Check out other pawn shop they will offer you more money.</Text>

I always knew pawn shops as sketchy, grimy places but CashCo is the exact opposite. It is so nice inside, I feel like I am walking into a bank. I have credit problems so I don't usually like working with a big banking establishments so I frequently visit pawn shops. I had never been to CashCo before but after seeing the inside and the way I was treated I will only be coming back to this location!<//Text>

<review>I went in trying to sell a ring I have. They offered me $30 for something that was bought for $500.00 & worth more than $850.00!!! I understand it would be lower, but not of that much difference!!!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< review>
Just had our garage burglarized and called to ask if a very unique item was there. They wouldn't tell me over the phone if they had it or not. What's the difference between telling me over the phone if it's in the shop or me just walking in and seeing if it's there? Very sketchy.<//review>

I had ordered a square cut pizza for my nephew, who for whatever reason loves square cut pizza. Didn’t get that, got regular. However, they offered to fix the problem but hands me back double sliced regular. Where is the square? Then on top of that they were using their hands to sprinkle the cheese. If you ran out of gloves, close the shop until you get more especially during covid. Won’t be ordering from here anymore.<//Text>

Today I ordered an online Special that included Cheese Sticks. I specifically requested that the Garlic Sauce come with the sticks, instead of the default pizza sauce. When I received the order there was pizza sauce in the box, although my receipt and the order sticker attached to the box clearly stated Garlic Sauce. When I showed the "large, heavy-set" elderly fellow--clearly one of the pizza makers, based on his attire--the box label and pizza sauce he replied "Oh, you want something else?!" I told him I just wanted what I ordered. So the now clearly disturbed pizza maker grabs a garlic sauce container from under the counter, and without making eye contact chucks the container in my direction. When I thank him, he ignores me and walks away. So I say "it's 'You're welcome', Sir.", he tells me "You're done. Goodbye". I guess the Garlic Sauce was coming out of his check or something! To add insult to injury, the "All the Meats" pizza I ordered had not one sliver of pepperoni or bacon on it--just sausage, ham and cheese! In any event, it would seem the rumors were true. My firm will be cutting off any continued donations to any Papa John's programs and this location will be recognized via letter sent Papa's Corporate Leadership. The 'customer' only asked for what was ordered, guys. It's only a sauce container, yet the 'employee' made it into an issue. Missing toppings is unacceptable, especially when there is a chart regarding which toppings go on Specialties posted above your pizza prep station.<//review><rate>1<//rate></record>

We called in and ordered under the name Thomas, Hannah. When we reached the store; there was no order in that name. The items we ordered was under the name Thomas, Brittney. Had to wait for a few minutes!! Why to call and order, if we have to wait. Because of the COVID situation, I waited outside the store where they could see me. They should have called me or waved at me when the order was ready. They did not. I went in and inquired. They handed over the box which was ready for full five minutes. I asked them for extra pepper. They said they would charge 81 cents. A dollar for one single Jalapeno Pepper !! That is too much after I paid 25 dollars for a Pizza....
The Pizza tastes good but, the attitude of the Pizza girl left a sour aftertaste!!</review>

The young lady that took my order of a bbq chicken Papadia, she was amazing. She even brought it to my car to keep the store empty. She didn't give me a recept, so don't know her name, but she was great. Thank you.</review>

It's best if you pick up, delivery is a option but both times I got it delivered I was last to receive my food and had to reheat it. Doesn't make me very happy since I usually have a 4:50 delivery fee from Papa John's and then I also usually give the driver's about 4 bucks so that's 850 to be last in line I wasn't happy<//Text>

Phenomenal Food... Horrible Service... The Manager on duty tonight informed me he's new to this location. Barely transferred here 6 months ago. This explains my whole experience. Well it looks like they lost a longtime local customer. He didn't wanna give any names or numbers to his superiors so it's fine. I'll take my business elsewhere... Grade D+< /text>

<text>delivery boy: pretty cool
food & service: very poor, they sent my business the WRONG ORDER and the Manager of Store#1993, BRENDA was rude and did not even seem in the slightest to care about making my order correct.  WHAT HAS BECOME OF PAPA JOHNS!!!!???? I HAVE LIVED IN RANCHO CUCAMONGA DAMN NEAR MY WHOLE LIFE and never been treated this badly!!!!!!  she didnt remake the items they didn't send ranch for (i payed extra for this rancho 2, which wasnt there)    ALSO they sent me some girl named megan's pizza (which was pretty gross btw megan ur not missin out on much, but i was so hungry i still ate half)

i wasted an hour and a half of my peaceful life stressin about papa johns pizza.

LONG STUPID STORY LATER ->  just goto a different papa johns not the one on foothill blvd very fkn horrible experience with the Manager BRENDA   !

after all that they sent me the ranch i originally ordered, an hour late.  and also they sent me the pizza i originally ordered, an hour late.  but i have a stomach ache from BRENDA and the first crap the should have shipped to megan!

<Text>Easy appointments, clean, quiet salon. Customer service is the best! They fixed my eyelash extensions at no charge when they fell off within days of application. They went above and beyond of accommodating my schedule and saw me after hours. I recommend this place.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2d5d5c184a2e1:0x7c5cea8c24d9193</gmapID><date>1616731376628<//date></record></dataset><record>

Went to the Hacienda Heights location this time. Disappointed the technician was not as through as my technician at the San Gabriel location. She didn't wear gloves nor did she cleanse my lashes and eyelids before applying new lashes.<//text>

I recommend Sumi Beauty Station to anyone who is looking to get good quality eyelashes. My eyelash technician did an excellent job. When she was done I was more than happy with my eyelashes. I can’t wait to come back :)</text>

<review>All the technicians are very friendly and do an excellent job. I more specifically love Bin’s work I was super excited when he moved from the San Gabriel location to Hacienda Heights. Love how clean all the stations are. I have recommended a few friends and family members and they all have loved Sumi Beauty.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2d5d5c184a2e1:0x7c5cea8c24d9193<//Gmap_id></record>

< review>
Better off buying a good mascara that will last longer than two weeks. They use cheap material.  Also I woke up to my eyes burning and stinging because of the cheap glue that was use.  You get what you pay for a cheap job and average lashes. I even paid extra for better lashes and still not what I expected.  My lashes were all one length it look like my own lashes with mascara.  Total waste of time they said they would fix them and then they wanted to charge me more absolutely ridiculous.I asked to speak to the owner Or manager Unfortunately due to the language barrier it was like speaking to the wall.  This is my first time ever posting a negative comment in my entire life.</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Only two days after receiving the false eyelashes, one-fourth of the false eyelashes have fallen off, and some of them are still hanging on them. According to the rules, they did not stick to water for more than 10 hours. The grafting speed is fast, but the effect is really not very good. A bad eyelash extension.

(Original)
才接了两天假睫毛掉了四分之一，有几根还悬挂在上面，按照规矩做10多个小时没有粘过水的，嫁接的时候速度快，但是效果真的不是很好，最差的一次接睫毛。</Review>

My wife had a performance scheduled for Sunday, so naturally her bow died on Saturday about noon. We called Loveland and rushed down to see if they could help. Julian was very helpful and said he would take a look and see if he could do anything. Unfortunately the bow expert was only available on Friday and Tuesday but they had a reasonably priced backup so all is good.  They have a beautiful selection of instruments and are very knowledgeable. As newcomers to Santa Rosa, we’ve found our go to place for stringed instruments.</Review>

I am writing after reading the other review and having had almost the opposite experience.  I went into to Loveland (highly recommended by many people) for a repair on my cello after being told by another instrument repair that I should replace all my pegs and should probably get a new instrument.  But, Loveland said my instrument was fine, they fixed the problem in a few minutes for 5 dollars and I have had no problems since.</review>

I recently decided to take up the violin, a friend gave me his old one and I took it to Loveland to have it checked out. I was immediately given the hard sell about how I should replace this "piece of junk" with a new $450 violin from Loveland, with custom this and special that, they hand cut the bridge for every violin! I felt like I was being sold a car by a smarmy dealer. I decided to rent a violin instead from another local company.</text>

The staff at Select Therapy is amazing. Valery checked me in and evaluated me for my range of motion to set up a plan to treat my pain. Front desk staff always greet you when you enter and when you leave the facility. Every staff calls you by your name as you enter the workout area. Valery Is really calm and knowledgeable about what you need along with Zee that makes sure the proper equipment for your treatment is ready to go. The staff all work together and make you feel welcomed, they are funny with many quick jokes. They are always asking how you doing and encourages you by saying things like you are doing good or so much better. I’m very impressed with the operation and how organized the team operates. GREAT People and and awesome service to do many. I say a BIG Thank you Select Physical Therapy Team.👍🏾< /Review>

<text>Physical therapy isn't anyone's favorite thing to do, but I'm "enjoying" it at Select Physical Therapy. The place is clean, the staff is very welcoming, and the general atmosphere is very warm. Because of all that, the folks receiving physical therapy tend to be friendly. And, of course, the therapists are knowledgeable, and I'm seeing and feeling improvement in only my first 3 sessions!< /text>< user_name>

Dana was instrumental in helping me strengthen my core for an upcoming surgery. She was diligent in ensuring my exercise plan would help my recovery, current pain and balance issues. At each session, Dana spent time introducing  new exercises or working on my balance and massaging the area that was causing me problems.
I am in recovery now, and look forward to heading back to Select Physical Therapy when I get the thumbs up from the orthopedist.
In addition to Dana, Ashley did a great job in keeping  me motivated and prepping me for the session.</Review>

The front office staff was friendly and efficient. I never had to wait more than five minutes to get into my appointment, to schedule my next appointment or to discuss payment and insurance information. Physical Therapist Michael Kubota was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, professional and witty.  My experience with him has been fabulous.  He identified my problems or addressed my pains/concerns quickly and worked diligently to alleviate my pain.  He was generally interesting and funny and was good with conversation to help distract me from the painful procedures. The PT Assistant Ashley was exceptionally fun and friendly.  She always had a smile on her face and was very attentive, friendly and interactive. I highly recommend Select Physical Therapy and will definitely return if i ever need PT again.<//Text>< GmapID>

The staff is fantastic. I’ve worked with a number of them and their work is great. They are caring and focused with constant communication and direction on how to quickly get to the next level. I had PT in the past and they are by far better trained with a more organized plan and approach to quickly make improvements each day. They were recommended to me - and I am finding for good reasons. I will recommend them to any who asks.<//text>

I have had the unfortunate need for PT twice in the past year, however I have had the good fortune to have my PT at Select Physical Therapy.  I've worked with two different teams and each time I have had the best care.  They listen, are empathetic and considerate.  I highly recommend this team.</review>

<text>Working through the rehab process of an occupational injury and this team are on the ball. Four sessions in, plus following the program laid out for me at home, is already paying dividends. The staff at Select are attentive, intuitive, will completely work with you and they are hilarious on top of everything else.

Mike is hands on, I feel as if I have already improved after one visit.  I had knee surgery in the past, went to a place in Los Alamitos but pretty much did all the rehab exercises on my own as the staff seemed very disengaged.  Rarely did I see the PT.

I have been helped immensely through receiving PT here. The therapists are always very kind, considerate, compassionate and helpful. I've never seen such a HAPPY and CHEERFUL group of workers! They are conscientious to not only my needs, but everyone around me. I see the compassion and consideration expressed to everyone. Kenny has done things for my neck that NO chiropractor or other therapist has ever tried. I've benefitted tremendously!
After arriving yesterday to a very strong and unpleasant odor of tar from them fixing the roof, even though they were ventilating the area with open doors, I was still moved to the other gym area. Then after my session, when I was heading back over to the reception area to make another appointment, Jim decided to personally walk me outside, and back around to deter me having to smell the nasty aroma again! He then very kindly told the other patients in the waiting area to get up, and follow him to the other gym. Once again being very conscientious of the  patients,  and the smell!
This is NO huge surprise to me, as these are things I see demonstrated in this office consistently! Every one I have ever encountered is very sweet, kind, helpful, professional and friendly. I absolutely recommend ALL the staff very highly!</Text>

Their staff is knowledgeable, professional, and competent, and makes sure you are well taken care of when providing services.  You never have to wait long to be seen when you arrive, and they send you appt. reminders.  Dana assessed me and worked with me on various exercises, carefully explaining what I was to do, and she also gave me very clear home exercises to do when leaving.  I  did them, and noticed my pain had already diminished.  So glad I chose to go to Select Physical Therapy!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><rating>5< /rating><Date>1554164121566< /Date>< Name>

As a retired RN and now as a customer, I can honestly say this is the very best place for PT.  Dr Jim and Bobby are both so experienced and human in their approach.  They head up a fabulous staff, front desk works very hard to meet your scheduling needs and entire PT staff is excellent.  You won't find a better place to push you toward desired outcomes within your limitations.< /text>

<Review>I’ve been to Select Physical twice for different issues. Each time, Jim Pelonis has taken the time take your history down to the last detail. He takes his time to be sure you receive the correct exercises. His assistants are wonderful as well. The front staff is friendly and helpful. You are NEVER rushed at any point in your therapy. I would recommend this group to anyone in need of PT.</Review>< name>

I've just started working with Jim Pelones after rotater cuff surgery.  He is clearly an experienced professional.  I'm confident that I will make excellent progress in my recovery.</text>

I have been a patient at Select Physical Therapy of Long Beach, twice in the last few years.  Both times I was offered surgery or to give P.T. a go, first.
I am on my second go round of P.T., and thanks to the knowledgeable staff, and careful care, I am having great results, again!  I would recommend anyone who has the option of P.T. pre or post surgery to go to Select and give their knowledgeable and caring staff a try.  I am thrilled with my results!< /Review>

This is such a great physical therapy place! The therapists are knowledgeable, kind, personable and get results! After 3, separate surgeries/injuries, they have been amazing every time, returning me to good health. Thank you Mike, Jessica, Ashley and Joslyn! You're the best!<//text>

<text>I have only been to a few Physical Therapists in my life, but I think this is the last one.   I would not go anyplace else after going here, Mike and the crew got me moving again, and made sure I knew what to do once done with PT with them to keep me moving.  Highly recommend them!<//text>< Pictures>

Select Physical Therapy is the best.  They really listen to what you say and customize your workout to your abilities.  Not only do they show you how to do the exercises, but they also tell you what not to do at home so you do not re-injure yourself. Would recommend them to everyone.<//Text>

I wish that I could give less stars for this facility. Unprofessional and undignified are the two words that come to mind to describe this facility. What kind of place will sit there and make fun of their patients while they are trying to get better. This place does that. They decided that a good use of their time was to make fat jokes and how many of the people in their facility remind them of those jokes. All these people are trying to get better, they can't exercise because they are broken. The job of the physical therapist is to heal not be a righteous @$$hole and make fun of the people who came to you for help.<//Text>

The employees are very patient nice and helpful with customer service attitudes. The store has been neat and organized. Pretty decent parking available at no additional cost with handicap accessible parking spaces. Etc. If you like low cost shopping for home decor, miscellaneous items, men's and women's and children's clothes, shoes, linens etc. this is your go to store!< /Text>

However I do feel that sometimes it does get overwhelmed with the amount of people. It seems they over pack the place with people from time to time. Please be mindful of others safety by covering up with a face shield if you don’t like a cover mask. There were serval people inside the store without the cover mouth. The prices seem good. I got good priced items. The cashiers tend to be quick to check out but some are new to the system so it is a bit of a slower process. Overall I don’t mind this store. The items seem to be good but within a few days of opening the customers kind off already flipped the place up side down in some areas.< /text></record></dataset><record>

We just went there to pick up a gift card for a birthday. Everyone seemed to be doing their job. It always amazes me how in certain neighborhoods customer service is so different. Everyone deserves great customer service</review>

I went to this DD’s an hour before closing time, there were less than five customers in there so I thought it would be a pretty easy shopping trip. I was wrong. The entire time that my friend and I (we are both black women) were looking around one of the associates kept staring at us but we ignored it. After finding what I was looking for I went to the checkout line, there was no one in line but me. The associate who was supposed to be at the register was handling some merchandise with his back towards me, when he decided to turn around he looked at me and turned back around to continue what he was doing. About a minute later a couple came from the electronics section and he asked them if they were ready to checkout. They had a lengthy conversation while he was checking them out. When it finally was my turn to checkout my friend decided to complete the purchase for me because the associate made me uncomfortable. The associate (who’s name is Abraham according to his name tag) didn’t greet us, he acted as if having to check us out was a burden for him. His demeanor was very off putting. When he was done he told us to have a good night but he sounded very annoyed that he had to tell us that. After this experience I’m never shopping at this DD’s again. Abraham made it very clear that people like my friend and I (BLACK people) aren’t welcome here.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The store is good but the service is terrible as in other dds, what can we do if there are no more candidates for the dds stores. Poor employees work without passion at their work.

(Translated by Google) Good prices and service, although it will be that they have been opened for a short time, but I think there is a lack of variety in articles and clothing in general

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Came here with my girlfriend recently and just planned on sitting and watching her do her thing.  However, a pair of grey shoes  caught my attention when we first walked in and before I knew it, I was the one at the checkout line buying shoes.  She ended up not getting anything, but I’ve got a great pair of kicks!<//Review>< Name>

Two stars, but is anyone really surprised?  There’s a reason this place is so cheap!  You really get what you pay for (which in my case was poor service and crappy shoes).< /Text>

They say you eat with your eyes but I was drinking with them. I had their mystique tiger boba latte, very sweet, so if you like it less sweet let them know. I wanted the full sugar rush. They do tell you to mix it before drinking but as a true Google I had to take a pic, drink from the top to taste the blue water and then taste from the bottom.... yes I have my own steps. Anyways once I mixed it, it all came together.<//review><Rating>4</Rating></record>

Our absolute favorite boba place in the area. All the drinks I’ve had are good and they use real fruit in everything.

Favorites: taro milk tea (real taro!), jasmine milk tea, strawberry green tea

Really appreciate the mask requirement too!< /Review>

Their tea is very good. I do enjoy going here. But they are a bit more expensive than my tea places that are closer to me. And they don't have any place to sit down and just relax and enjoy my tea.< /text>

I appreciate that you can customize your drinks from the sweetness level to the account of ice, and for some drinks, non-dairy options.

We decided to try this place because it is rated 5 stars and we can definitely see why! Customer service is on point and the tea is fragrant and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. The drinks are flavorful and the toppings plentiful at a great price. I only wish there was a bigger size because my wife and I guzzled our drinks in a matter of minutes!<//text>

<text>There aren't too many tea/boba places that I return to, but this shop is definitely worth it. You can adjust sweetness and ice levels, the tea quality is good (which I can't say about a lot of other places), and they also have coffee and seasonal offerings (I loved the fall pumpkin drink!). Grapefruit green tea is a winner if you like grapefruit (I usually get 25-50% sweetness).< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

We ordered three drinks, the Princess Lychee with lychee jelly and grass jelly, strawberry green tea with aloe and lychee jelly, and an oreo brulee.  The girl cashier was very friendly and patient with us as we were a little  undecisive.

This was our first time here and it was worth the drive.  The girl who made our drinks told my daughter if we didn't like our drinks to let them know and they'll remake it.  It was very nice for her to offer but it was all perfect.  Everything was delicious and we found our new boba stop.<//review>

< Review>
I went for my first time tonight (9.29.2020) and I'm so glad I did. I wish I got the names of the two girls that were working because they were so helpful. I went in wanting pomegranate green tea or something similar. They helped me decide on the grapefruit green tea and it was so good! I added aloe toppings and it made it even better. I will definitely be going back I just wish that they were open on Sundays too.</Review>

<Text>This place is near my work, and I’m quickly becoming obsessed. The first time I tried it I literally had it every day that week, everything I’ve had there has been amazing. I got the princess peach drink and my only complaint is that I can never get enough. My coworker also got the grapefruit tea and that was delicious!! I also tried their watermelon tea and that was also really good but definitely not as good as the grapefruit green tea and the princess peach drink (but watermelon isn’t in season right now so I’m sure that was a factor). This place is super cute inside and I can’t wait to try more of their delicious drinks! Their boba is always a perfect texture and not overly sweet. Overall its just great and everyone should try it!<//Text>< pics>

They recommended I try their Nutella drink based off what I was craving and it was really good! The whole team is super friendly, the ambience is calming, and the place is really clean. They even tell you if you need any changes to your drink or anything to let them know. And when you leave they all tell you to have a great day/ night.

This boba shop does not have a Brown sugar milk tea, it does have a classic milk tea so you have to add Brown sugar to it and the flavour changes depending on the one making it. Otherwise it's a good and tasty drink 😊< /Text>

So good! first of all staff is so sweet and are willing to make any changes to your drink if it didn’t meet expectations. However that is not going to be a problem because the drinks taste so yummy!
Love the Nutella Boba Slush and my bus and loves the iced coffee. If you are wanting a refreshing sweet drink definitely go with the fruit bomb or the orange green tea!< /Text>

<review>Dr Faisal first treated me in year 2,000. I can honestly say that Dr Faisal saved my life. He is a medical professional who truly cares about his patients and their well-being. He is very attentive, patient, thorough, compassionate and, most importantly, extremely knowledgeable. He has extensive education in the Neurological field and it shows. His office staff cares about his patients. I highly recommend Dr Faisal and his practice.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>I have pain and feels like walking on pins and needles. I went for nerve tests in my legs. While the doctor who performed my tests was very nice but unfortunately, he wasn't allowed to tell me what is wrong with me. The front desk refused to give me a follow up appointment with doctor Faisal. My primary doctor never received the tests results from this center. I had to ask the center's receptionist twice to please fax it again. 3 weeks went by and it never happened. Meanwhile I am in pain. I had to fax them myself to my Primary doctor making sure, he got them OK. Then, I wanted to discuss the results, but my primary doctor said only the Neurologist Doctor Faisal will be able to discuss my tests results with me. I called the center asking for an appointment but none is available before 2 months from now. I told her I really can't wait that long with so much pain. So, I kindly asked if a doctor could at least call me for 5 minutes to discuss my tests results, but the receptionist was so unaccommodating and so very rude with me yelling "SO DO YOU WANT THIS APPOINTMENT 2 MONTHS FROM NOW OR NOT?" I said I am sorry but I am in pain and cannot stay 2 months like this so please arrange for a neurologist to call me. She answered very abruptly: " Just discuss the results with your primary doctor" when I had already told her 3 times that my primary had told me, he has no knowledge of understanding the nerve tests results and was told that only a neurologist can. She did not care at all and hang up the phone saying sarcastically "bye, have a good day". I can't believe there is not a single doctor at this center who can discuss my results over the phone. The pain in my legs is getting unbearable...  HORRIBLE PLACE. DO THE DOCTORS AT THIS PLACE REALIZE HOW INEFFICIENT AND RUDE IS THE FRONT STAFF? This is beyond my understanding.<//review><date>1626133045111</date></record>

Our appointment with Elaine Chen PA was wonderful.  We came to see her for my father’s advanced Parkinson’s disease.  She was compassionate and very informative. We are happy to have found her and on the right path  as we had horrible past experiences with other facilities.< /Text>

<Review>IAM A HEART  Patient and a Brain Aneurysm Survivor. The Experience I had with this office was HORRIFYING!!!! Specifically with ELAINE CHEN PA. No one thats going thru strokes and  Neurological problems should ever deal with her. She is Rude,Cold, disconnected, and  Pompous!!!! She doesnt need to be a Doctor. The people working in the office are not competent  to run the office</Review>< pictures>

I scheduled a sleep study approximately two weeks before my appointment. An opening came up to meet the doctor and discuss it prior to the study. My GP sent a prescription for the study and I called the day before  to confirm they had everything they needed and was told they Had everything including insurance authorization and that somebody would call me to discuss the procedure. No one ever called and.a few hours before I was supposed to come they called and said they couldn’t find anything and I had to cancel. I have a voicemail stating that they mistakenly Scheduled the study. Totally on organized. And I still never received a call to follow up and probably wouldn’t come if they did at this point.<//Text>

Absolutely amazing clinic. The staff is welcoming, efficient, kind, and welcoming. The office it self is in a nice part of town and is clean and kept well, and Dr. Chen is absolutely great. I felt listened to as a patient and she heard out all of my symptoms and told me the course of action we will take, and provided me with everything I needed to get me through while my insurance approves for an MRI.<//text>

< Review>
Dr. Faisal is very sharp and efficient. However, his support staff are not up to  par in customer service and follow ups. He was recommended by my PCP Dr. Lorie Kashkaryan of Cedar Sinai Holywood Medical Group. I went initially due to concern on memory loss. After a series of questions and tests he deduced I so not have symptoms of dementia and ordered sleep study and referred me to a PT for my nerve pain on my wrist and my right knee pain. He also ordered an MRI for my brain and cervical spine since I have a chronic neck and shoulder pain. Staff are too busy one time I waited for over 45 mins. only to find out that the technician was also waiting for me and was about to report me as no show because the receptiontist forgot me waiting upfront. Today I called to request for the referral that the PT needed. The staff was short since she was expecting me to give her the fax number of the PT office. She cut me short and said she will find it and hang up. I like Dr. Faisal but I recommend that the front staff be re-evaluated for customer service and courtesy.< /Review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Western Neurological was an entirely efficient and professional experience. The booking staff was helpful and pleasant when booking an appointment.

My doctor was Elaine who was fully informative and had great bedside manner while dealing with me. She was incredibly knowledgeable, putting me at ease about my symptoms and knowing that I was in good hands.
I left feeling secure and hopeful about the help I received from this center. I highly recommend using Western Neurological as your provider.

NEW REVIEW ADDITION:  Fast forward to 2 weeks after my appointment:  Someone in the office gave the wrong code to my MRI so I received the wrong MRI!!!  It was in the same area of the body so it wasn’t obvious, but the facts are that somehow the wrong code was given to the MRI place so I now have to get another one!
Mistakes happen, but I would think there’s a better system involved for something like that.
Thankfully, I wasn’t getting my leg amputated!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Been seeing a neurologist at this office for 3 years. I've never actually met Dr Faisal, and it seems many who go here do not either. Writing this just because as most other reviews here say, the office staff are pointless. I've missed medications because they cant/always forget to get messages to the Doctor. They always leave you on hold for simple things and the ladies in the front don't seem to care that they work in a medical office where many might need accommodations. Dr. Elaine is great though, she should have her own practice.</Text>

Dr. Fasial has been my mom's Neurologist for over 20 years. He is an excellent MD. He is a great listener and helps in any way he can. He cares about his patients like they are part of his family! He is a good human being. I recommend him to all who need a Neurologist!Thank you for all that you do for my family!</Review>

<Review>Absolutely pathetic people! Refused me services because I can't wear a mask. I was just at their office for nerve conduction test on 8/28/20 with no issues. I wear a face shield that gets me in any doctor appointment, or public gathering. Office is 30 mile drive! I'm forced to give one star when they deserve a negative -5 rating! Absolutely unbelievably pathetic to deny people with disability!<//Review>< gmap_id>

The office staff was super friendly too and made me feel welcome and comfortable. The only reason I'm doing four stars instead of five is because it is very hard to get an appointment here and you will wait a few months to get in.

I have been going to Dr. Faisal for over ten years since moving from another state.I have suffered with severe migraine headaches since high school. Dr. Faisal has been my savior by helping me manage my migraines through recommending  and having me try different medications to find the ones that work most effectively. When I had issues come up Dr. Faisal and his staff addressed them and still do to help me work them out so I can continue my treatment and my medications seamlessly. He is caring and I feel very comfortable about going to see him. He listens to my concerns. He and his staff over the years have been very accommodating to special needs that I required in regards to medications and insurance issues. He also helped me get through some horrific environmental issues which exacerbated my migraines.

To me Dr. Faisal is reminiscent of the best doctors I have had and I highly recommend him</Review>

< Review>
I have been seeing Dr Faisal since November for Chronic Migraines. He’s busy and his front office staff is busy BECAUSE HE IS AMAZING!!! Be patient, sit down and wait. Give the front office staff some grace, their phones ring OFF THE HOOK. Dr. Faisal takes the time to listen, to adjust medications and treatment as needed, to go over what’s been going on since your last visit, etc. he gets backed up because of emergencies, a new patient that had a stroke and needs extra time, whatever it is, he takes the time to treat each patient with the dignity and respect and attention they deserve!

The front office staff is also amazing. They are busy, like really busy, but they always take the time to help with an insurance question, scheduling issue, etc. Next time you are there, take them a box of treats and say thank you instead of running and writing a horrible review because you had to wait.<//Review>

They kept me for an hour trying to figure out if they are working with Oscar Network. They never heard about Oscar Insurance Company even though it's listed on Oscar website under network profile. Finally, they said you covered and I were able to see the doctor after 2 hours of wait time. I'm very frustrated now becuase I just received a bill from Western Neurological saying Oscar is not in our Network. I'm seeking a help from Oscar to resolve this Fraudulent !< /review>< pictures>

Don’t expect the office staff to be competent, you’re place on hold for at the very least 10 min. Which is unexceptionable. The women of the front office seem very impersonal, inefficient and incapable. It gets even more frustrating when you witness them not working and only talking about personal issues.
They overbook so when you’re there you’re waiting in the waiting room for 30 min to an hour before even taking  you in a room for about the same about of time before you ever see the doctor.
When you make an appointment (A month in advanced), they will reschedule your appointment because their office staff booked another appointment before you that overlaps your appointment so they will bump your appointment instead of correcting their mistake which is unprofessional. How about marking that space off permanently for consultations so all the staff knows not to make regular appointments within that time.
They have no sense of compassion for anyone else’s importance of time. You’re treated like cattle being ran through a shoot. And usually when you do see the doctor it takes only 15min.
The office staff needs to learn more organizational, scheduling and phone skills. Additionally, if they are so busy, then they need to hire more people to handle the work load.
Our time is just as important!<//text>

I have been seeing Dr. Faisal for 20 years now and I can't imagine a more competent Neurologist. I am an RN so I know a good physician when I see one. Many of the reviews here are regarding his staff. He is just a phone call away. Just ask to speak with him. He is compassionate and knows what he is talking about.  Everyone has a bad day in the medical profession. Having been there. Give him a chance.< /Review>

<Text>I don't usually put too much stock into these negative reviews because too often they are based on one bad experience, one bad day, etc. Well, this is not one of those reviews because I've been coming to WNA for nearly six years and I will not be going back. Today was the straw that broke my back.

For nearly 6 years I would appear 10-20 minutes early to an appointment only to end up in the waiting room for at least hour (I waited 2.5 hours once). And this wait time was not done, they would just take you to your own personal room where you would wait another 30 minutes. Not a peep from me, I needed this doctor and as long as I get to see him that day, fine, I'll deal with it.

But today traffic was bad so I ended up getting to my appointment 10 minutes late. I am able to check in, however. I take a seat and everything seems fine. 30 MINUTES LATER, the technician burst through the door and tells me he is unable to see me today because I checked in late. Hey jerk, what the hell have you been doing for the last 30 minutes?

What makes this worse is that it takes me over an hour to get to this office. I have asked a couple times about seeing a closer specialist but my current doctor has consistently advised against it because he claims to know me well enough to make my care better.

When I think of all the time I patiently waited in that damn waiting room I feel like such an idiot. And maybe I am...DON'T BE AN IDIOT LIKE I AM...DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE.

As for the other staff? If you need to contact them by phone you better hope they pick up. They rarely called me back after leaving detailed messages on their answering service. When I follow up with them during office hours they act like they don't even know they have voicemail.

Seriously, avoid this place like the plague. I got a new doctor and I finally feel free.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>The doctor met with me one time when I was hospitalized. He did not listen to my description of what was going on but instead decided I was having seizures despite no supporting evidence. Prescribed Keppra which has done nothing. In subsequent visits to his office I met only with the nurse practitioner who increased the Keppra dosage, again with no results.  They have billed me incorrectly twice. I would strongly suggest that you find a real doctor. Highly dissatisfied.<//Text>< pics>

This Dr. could not get done fast enough with my test. I'm sure he covered everything but was quick to get done and not because he had patients waiting but because he wanted to get on his cell phone for whatever reason. No personal skills it seems.< /Review>

I’m on the fence about this place. Dr. Faisal is good, but his staff very unprofessional. Not all I must add, but I’ve been here couple times and 4 out of 5 of the girls who work here are pretty rude. Every time I call for anything as soon as phone is picked up they put you on hold for at least 15 minutes! I’m always early and 2x I’ve waited at least 1.5hr. If it wasn’t for my chronic migraines I’m sure I’d given up by now😩<//text>

Dr. Faisal saved my life. Not literally but just as profoundly. I had been diagnosed 2 years prior to becoming a patient of his. In that time, my insurance refused to cover the cost of a specialist and sent me around to other neurologists. Every single one of them said, they don't specialize in my diagnosis, I'm too severe, they don't know beyond the basic treatment protocol for my diagnosis and I needed to see someone specialized.
I spent years struggling, being beaten down by an insurance company who thought I'd give up. I nearly did. I nearly gave up the fight and went to live with my family and stop taking the minimally effective medicine.
When I first saw Dr. Faisal, he KNEW about my diagnosis. This was a first for me! He knew less common treatment methods and the hell I was living in. He took a great deal of time with me and came up with a plan WITH me! When I got my brain scan, he asked me to come around the other side of the screen to look at it with him.

Beyond that, his office staff are literal angels. They never stopped pushing my insurance company even after multiple denials. I don't know where they get the patience but I cannot express my gratitude enough. I have left here crying tears of joy on multiple occasions. I have my life back. My diagnosis does not dictate every thing I do anymore.
Keep in mind - because he spends individual time with you, you may wait in the waiting room longer than other doctors. Just deal with it because Dr. Faisal will give you the same attention he's giving someone else while you're waiting. Bring a book.
Also, he's still a doctor, and while I think he's the best I've ever been to, he still has all the typical doctor pragmatics, i.e., doesn't make a lot of eye contact, will cut you off mid-sentence, minimal small talk. These don't mean he doesn't care, it just means he's a doctor and spent years specializing in neurology while other people were honing their social skills (like every other neurologist).

I hesitate to write this because it will make his waitlist longer, but other people deserve the same level of medical care. So here you go :)< /text>

<review>Great sleep study BUT very poor customer service.  If you wish to speak with someone on the phone and happen to finally get someone, the receptionist has poor phone skills.  Also, when I was told I would receive a call back, I never did.
Then, when I left messages on their VM they never called back.

This is not a professional business, but unfortunately in network.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I spent hours there doing test.
Came back for my next appt for more test and they had no knowledge of my testing or appointment. I lost a days pay to make my appointment. They treated me like I was lying and had never been there. I got the MRI they ordered but never gave me the results. I had to go to another Dr.to order MRI redults.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

This has been one of the worst experiences i have ever received. The office staff will tell yoi 5 to 10 business days  for results each and every time you call. I have severe sleep apnea and they are treating me like a joke after the Dr. Faisal told me how serious this condition is. I started process on Jan 31st it is now April 19th and still nothing. They never call you back when they say they will. I only get updates if i call. Stay away from this office. If i could start over i would. This is one of the most unprofessional staffs ive ever had to do business with.< /text>

< review>
My experience supports the many Yelp reviews, mostly of the office staff.  Trying to get a referred sleep study was almost impossible because of telephone hang-ups, not returned calls, and cancelled or mis-scheduled appointments.  Once I went through the entire process of having a sleep study and diagnosed with serious sleep apnia, the ball was dropped again.  Five months later I still have no c-pap machine, despite numerous calls and visits to the office.
Be wary of this facility!< /review>

<text>It's such an AMAZING skate park!!! It has a cool skater  area, a quad roller skate area, AND a park with some cool equipment for the kids. Gorgeous park! There is a gas station/convenience store CONVENIENTLY located behind the ample parking lots. It's an ALL in ONE location!! I will definitely be back with my skates!</text><user_id>108589180935697629984< /user_id><Rating>5< /Rating><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfhC4K-C-tpzEp-XE76qHldCbFnez3SOoGLmsK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics></record>

Cool park with big playground, bbq areas for different size groups. Also has a sweet skate park and lots of pick up games at the basketball courts.< /text>

<Review>Fun little spot next to the skate park and basketball courts. There are some at least two excellent grills available for some light to heavy duty grill work to be accomplished. Bathrooms are on site, as well.

We may have arrived a little too early (9AM), as the overnighter were still on the premises, gathering their belongings to leave. You are close to the gas station and main road (1), and the hospital is a few blocks away. It didn't seem like a safety concern to me, but if you are uncomfortable in these situations, you should take this into consideration.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Super awesome place to take the kids to skate. But a good amount of the local kids were rude towards others....kinda disappointed on that part. Other than that totally cool spot!!<//text>

<review>The skatepark is so cool! There’s a bunch of different bowls and ramp and the snake run is so fun! That giant wave makes the skatepark more picturesque. Love that park</review>< pics>

Pretty much a campground for homeless people. don't take your kids there unless you want to take a chance of your child stepping on hypodermic needle. Or listen to the crazy homeless people scream at each other.</review>

<Review>SLO skate park has everything you'd want if you're looking to take your skate-fu to the next level. The people I see here are friendly and respectful. Ideal place for a picnic, reading books and exercising in town. I give Santa Rosa Park a 5/5; would definitely dislocate my left elbow again.a</Review>< Pics>

Playground is minimal but fun for younger kids. Definitely a hotspot for homeless individuals who are scattered throughout the park, sleeping on sidewalks, benches, grass. My son was playing by some bushes and the maintenance man approached me and suggested I keep my kids away from the bushes due to homeless throwing trash and syringes in them. Wasn't too thrilled about the thought of that. I did see one city police officer pull in, park for 15 minutes and leave. I'd probably feel better if there was more of a police presence around. It can be kind of unnerving if you're there alone with your children, even during the middle of the day.<//review>

<Review>Horrible! It's a shame to see this filthy conditions in a city with so much revenue. The picnic tables were nasty and at least a dozen homeless encampments along the fence occupying the park facilities. Do not let young children go there alone. It is definitely dangerous. Very sad situation for a city known as a touristic route. I will never stop there again. I"ll just keep driving thru.</Review><resp>None< /resp><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

While it's a very big park w picnic tables, shade trees and plenty of parking the local homeless have made it their night time hangout. During the day you'll see them sleeping on the tables, grouped up around trees, and loitering at the stores next door. Not the ideal park for kids.</review>

The park itself isn't that great and the location isn't very safe for the children. It's ambiance is very rushed and fast paced for my liking. It is near the creek however the creek is unkept and not very sanitary to say the least. I would not recommend to anyone. Especially tourists. You will be disappointed.<//Text>

<Text>The park was nice. Not too hot not to sunny with a nice cooling breeze. There were people enjoying the skate park the green grass and the shade of the tree as well as others playing with their children and making use of the roller hockey rink to practice. There was a lost fawn hopping around on the baseball field that seemed to draw a nice crowd if interested and curious new fans. I enjoyed it.< /Text><rate>4</rate>< date>

Skate park, Basketball court, baseball diamonds, horseshoe pits, kid play grounds, large picnic and barbeque areas, huge grassy verges and a creek overlook.  Roller derby try outs, sword guilds, volleyball, Pokémon Go 40+ players at once, I've seen so much fun happening in this park.  Plenty of parking, with two gas stations and mini-marts right there, and Taco Bell, Tacos Acapulco, a breakfast espresso place, Jack in the Box, Mr. Pickle, Ha Ha Sushi Bar and an emergency room and hospital all with in 2 blocks.</review>

This place is typically host to little league baseball and adult softball games. There's also a nice play ground, a roller rink and a skate park. It's always full of people and seems like a great place for kids and teens to hang out.

The only downside to this place is the bathrooms are absolutely HORRENDOUS. I NEVER use these ones.< /Text>

The park itself is on the smaller side then what we are used to but very nice and a fun place to visit. Definitely worth stopping by. Park was clean. Bathrooms were close enough to play structure. Plenty of kids of different age groups played here and had a blast. Also i think they larp here some weekends.

The skate park that was added a while back is pretty awesome even though I've never used it. Just going by the word on the mean streets of San Luis Obispo. If you can hang, drop on in and show your skillz. People seem to be pretty welcoming for the most part. Other than the significant transient population that tends to congregate here at times.<//Review><rate>5</rate>< date>

I had never before visited this park.  It's a lot of fun, and right next to the hospital where we were visiting someone.  There's a sort-of-secret entrance right across the street from the hospital, too.  That way you don't have to drive to the park--just park at the hospital and walk to the park!  Fun playground for the kids, and there's an awesome skate park!< /Text>

<Review>As far as parks go, this is one of the best in the city. It has restrooms, a great newer playground, large grassy area with trees, sports fields, dual purpose basketball courts/roller hockey rink, and a new skate park! Your kids will never run out of things to do at this park.<//Review><GmapID>0x80ecf1ab3de0104b:0x9142ba9dee8ec8db<//GmapID></record>

The park has a large grass area, a baseball field, basketball courts, picnic tables. There are public bathrooms right next to the little kids play area. There is a nice structure for playing on.
This is also a great skatepark. There is a large area specifically for skateboarding and tricks.<//Text>

This park has an awesome skate park and a decent skating rink. It is a great place to have a party, play a sport, bring your kids to play or just relax. It has the usual barbeque set up with ample table seating near the play structure and a huge baseball diamond area as well. On the weekends you can find people LARPing and other cool stuff. Could use another restroom more conveniently located near the skating area and baseball field.< /text>

<review>You got done homeless peeps or they have homes and pose to be homeless so they can hang out in the park and all for food and money. You also got some people on drugs now and then just walk on to the field during a softball game, they the in field, in the dugout and keep on walking... Trip out. Other than that, the skate park is very very top notch and a street hockey court... Out is it called a field...hmm it's on cement.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80ecf1ab3de0104b:0x9142ba9dee8ec8db</Gmap_id></record>

Great open space with plenty of infastructure and fields for all kinds of activities. Theres a playground and a horseshoe pit! The best part about this park is that on the weekends there are people who dress up and fight each other with swords. This area is truly built for peoppe from all walks of life.< /Text>

Came for the skate park ... no bikes. But that didn't stop me:) The bowl is amazing. The other areas are also great. Good transitions, overall great quality park. Cops came within 30 minutes of me being there but I have a feeling it was because of the transients smoking pot.<//Text>

Has a fancy skate board ramp setup, has a little league baseball field, just a great park to eat your lunch or just kick back In the sun. Oh, and don't forget the horse shoe pits< /text>

(Translated by Google) In that park you can find bowl base camp, basketball and skating courts and it is nice and relaxing to be lying on the grass, a very quiet place.

En ese parque puedes encontrar campo de base bol, canchas de basket bol y de patinaje y es bonito y relajante estar tirado en el pasto un lugar muy tranquilo.</text>
