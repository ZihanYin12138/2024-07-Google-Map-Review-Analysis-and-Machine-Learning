<Resp>None</Resp><Text>What a delightful taco spot! Absolutely delicious food at a reasonable price. Masa clearly done in house which instantly makes the tacos something special. Meat all tasted fresh and high quality. Guac was ON POINT. Special habanero hot sauce made in house they can give you upon request(love my HOT stuff).

Taco Neza is a WeHo GEM!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Great new taco spot a short walk from Runyon Canyon! picked up a lil dinner on our way home after an evening hike - highly recommend going with the tacos Alambres as it's the best bang for your buck (unless you're trying to go for a variety of flavors and then a la carte is for you)!
highly recommend the tomatillo guac - Also the chips are legit; nice thick, homemade tortilla: yum!

We got two orders: the Shrimp and Veg (mushroom) Alambres and chips n guac. Take away came with all the fixins to build street tacos at home. Ingredients were delicious and fresh tasting -everything is made to order. A light but filling dinner for two for under $30.
Looking forward to trying the chilaquiles!

Very clean and friendly service at this family owned spot. Highly recommend popping in for a bite!

*as of 06/2020 they are unable to open earlier than 11am, however the gentleman at the door said they are there and taking phone calls if you just can't wait and may be able to accommodate a late breakfast or early lunch order prior to officially opening at 11a (obvs on a case by case basis).
*That being said, this seems like a very nice family and like any new business that opened right as Corona hit, they are doing they best they can to assess and accommodate the needs of the neighborhood; happy to have 'em around especially as so many businesses are shuttering on that block.<//review>< Pictures>

The Vegan tacos are awesome. The Taco Plate is great, the Salsas are why I keep going back. Also if you mix the Lemonade with the Hibiscus Tea it is the most refreshing drink ever. The onion salsa is also awesome. The Mole taco is superb. Very vegan friendly. All the staff is really nice and really knowledgeable. I live around the corner and it has been my staple for Lunch and Dinner during this whole pandemic. A must try in LA.<//text>

As I drove home the aroma from my bag of tacos was intoxicating. Oh my goodness! I ordered the 2 taco beans/rice plate; pastor taco, carne asada taco and as from another review I read, the beans were in fact creamy. I did order a vegetarian Rajas taco wrapped in cheese as suggested by the nice cashier. I Was not at all disappointed. Very good meal. I look forward to trying more from the menu.  Thank you Tacos Neza<//Text>

Sorry to hear that about the pastor taco, I completely understand what you are saying, we are changing the way we build the trompo so we don't risk serving a taco with a disproportionate amount of fat pieces. We are glad to hear that that at least you liked the flavor of it! And we really hope to see you again."}</Resp>< text>
Very friendly staff. Nice decor. The egg, bean and cheese taco, I was very happy with.
But the pastor taco was strange. It wasn't like any other pastor taco I've ever had. Didn't seem like a classic Mexican pastor taco. Tons of huge pieces of fat in the meat, and the meat chunks were huge too. I know some people like their fat, but I can't stand it. For this, I had to give only 4 stars. The flavor of the pastor taco, of the pieces I was able to eat, was surprisingly good though.< /text>

This place has been through it (a car crashed into their front door right before the quarantine) and we’re so happy to see them reopened! First time and I loved the Chicken Mole burrito! Lots of great condiments/salsas and delicious Tomatillo Guac! Definitely going back soon to try more!</text>

<Text>Home made corn tortillas are ethereal. The kind of flavor you can usually only get in Mexico from good quality corn masa. They make them fresh to order. And it shows. So so so good. Breakfast tacos are sublime. As a Texas transplant, I can’t undersell how excited I am to have a breakfast taco spot like this in the hood. The refried beans are fantastic.

Also had the al pastor which was equally delicious. Nice thick cuts. Not dried out. Plump and juicy. The tacos are served with a nice accompaniment tray of chips, three salsas, limes, pickled onions, and diced pineapple.

I’m so happy they opened here. Don’t listen to the detractors. Gringos with no taste. This place is fantastic. Go.<//Text>< pictures>

Place is spotless and staff is nice. The tacos are unique, high quality meat and spartan. Upcharge for cheese and avocado, which is normal for a 2.50 taco, not so much for a 5.00 dollar taco. They are huge though and fried perfectly. Interesting local art on one wall,   two tvs that blast sports on the other. Volume a bit high for casual conversation. Decent food, great staff and if you are an NFL (I actually hate TV) fan something to drown out the street. The other nice thing is that there is no soda machine. Horchata and Mica plus fresh filtered water on one wall and Mexican bottled soft drinks behind the counter.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1575239427148, 'text': "Hi Chris, thank you very much for coming we really appreciate you taking the time to comment on our place. About the chips I want to let you know we don't fry anything on the fryer rather than chips, we don't even fry tacos, you can check our menu there is nothing fried in there. The shrimp and the ahi tuna we sell are both grilled and we even grill then on a special pan not in the full grill precisely to avoid any contamination. I am very sorry you felt like there was some fish in there I really don't know where does that comes from and don't know what could we do to prove it to you. If you ever want to come back we can talk about it. Again thank you for coming and taking the time and we hope to see you soon."}< /Response>< gmapID>

<text>I only write reviews if a place was amazing or horrible. I had to write to let people know the food here was horrible! The ambiance and people were nice but Nothing had flavor! we ordered al pastor, asada, guacamole, rice and refried beans. Everything was flavorless! The chips , the sauces, honestly tasted like cardboard and spit. Honestly never experienced this in my life, I only ate it because I paid for it and I was hungry. But wow never coming back. I feel bad because the people were nice but I’ve never had worse Mexican food in my life.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

We can only say to you and everyone reading this review that we guarantee that we only use natural and fresh ingredients, we cook everything by order, even the tortillas; and work really hard to represent the real and traditional flavors of Mexican culture. Again sorry for the bad experience, we can only hope that is more the people that like what we do than people that don't, and luckily for us most comments we have received represent exactly that.

I am a regular at this gas station it very clean and well lit up (safe) compared to others that are near by. I would say it's pricey but gas is pricey everywhere. If you like treats or something to quench your thirst they have plenty and always have deal, Good place to fill up</review>

NEVER AGAIN. Entered at 3pm today to grab a quick bottle of water with my 10lb service animal in my arms. Was yelled at and told to leave immediately by a mid 20's staff member with a name tag that read Judith but said her name was Christina when quieried. Note they have a walk-up window, but instead of kindly offering a solution to complete my transaction via the window, she instead fired off one comment after the next with absolutely no consideration for my "situation". I explained that it was nearly 100 degrees and it wasn't possible for me to leave the dog in the car. I explained that I simply needed a quick moment to complete my transaction. She refused. When I asked if she always treated people with service animals this way, she told me it was my fault because I didn't explain myself. She begrudgingly agreed to ring me up while continuing to fire off sharp and disrespectful commentary.  Keep in mind, at entry I wasn't asked..... she simply began yelling at me from behind the counter. She went on to tell me I should have tied the dog up outside. I expressed to her that there wasn't a suitable place to do so within view of the check-out counter and a small sized dog is easily capable of being taken. She then told me that was rediculous and expressed ZERO regard for me as a customer or an individual.  I'm a working professional, polite, and engaging with nearly everyone I encounter.  Thankfully I'm not routinely treated this way, but what I experienced today was downright harassment, verbally abusive in tone, approach, and bias. Service personnel who behave like this are why we're in a culture where people feel compelled to video disparaging and disrespectful treatment. It's wrong and it shouldn't be happening, period. It's easy to provide good customer service in nearly every situation, even when you feel a customer is doing something you think they shouldn't. I can respect whatever policy has been dictated to this employee, but use common sense and offer sensible solutions to someone who's just trying to spend money at your place of employment. I will be following up with the Chevron Corp regarding my experience at this franchise. Personnel should at minimum be transparent in identifying themselves, especially if they're going to specifically use another person's name tag and or identity to avoid accountabilty for bad behaviour. I wouldn't tolerate being spoken to this way by a stranger on the street let alone by a person representing a place of business.</text>

They blast non-stop advertisements at you while you're pumping gas. Very annoying. I won't be back here.</Review>

<text>Not only was the girl on the phone rude but she was also a poor communicator. She said this was a walk in service and would be back open at 1 after cleaning.  Upon arrival, the Barber was obviously happy to rudely share that he was closed.  Don’t waste your time with this place. I would give it no stars if I could.</text>< pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Excellent service.  They take seriously Covid issues, both the customers and those cutting hair.  No one has ever been remotely rude during the many years I have been getting my hair cut there.  Nameless reviewers always raise red flags about their complaints being authentic and likely are based on some slight they may have experienced.  It is afterall a small town vendor struggling to survive - and adapting to thei changing business models forced on us and driving the small town businesses out of business.  One trip there will make a believer out of you - best place in Auburn to get a haircut.</text>< Pictures>

<Time>1596439943616< /Time><pics>None</pics><Review>It was alright. Only one person working there so I had to wait for a bit, and when I got my haircut there was nearly no conversation to be had. I would initiate, "hi, how's it going" and no response. Could've just been an off day for the barber, or you might have a different experience with a different employee...

Tldr: good cut, minimal social interaction, kinda awkward</Review>< UserId.>

I really wanted to like this place, but I was horribly disappointed. The barber cutting my hair seemed like she did not want to be there and she butchered my hair. It was like she was halfway through and she just decided “f it, I’m done.”< /text>

The lady who works there does not wear a face mask. Nasty. I wouldn’t let them cut my hair. I just left.<//Review>

< Review>
its like the barbershop in Gran torino, but Steve is much nicer....  He cut my hair until i moved away but always remember his wit and charm.   the pictures of war planes and the great specimen donning the back wall for decades are all a bonus.< /Review>

This was a cool location and fit the bill. It reminded me of the Barber Shop I use to go to as a kid, so that was cool. I got there when they opened and the gentleman was ready for me. The place filled up quick, so I must have picked the right spot. I like going to these types of places much more that the big chains, but they are getting harder to find these days. Will come back next time I am in the area and need a haircut.</Text>< Time>

<Text>The younger lady that cut my hair seemed very disinterested in her job and her customers. The haircut wasn't that good either. The airplane pictures on the wall are delightful, so I'm sad that I probably won't be going back to see them.</Text>< date>

While the shop was neat. I took my 5 year old in and the gal was less than patient, repeatedly told him to hold still and as her frustration grew so did his fear.< /Review>

Couldn't ask for a better neighborhood pizzeria. Our usual order is the BBQ Chicken pizza - it's the perfect size for a hungry couple to finish off for a meal. Aside from the pizza being tasty, consistent, and very affordable, Sarah at the front is the sweetest. We're always greeted with enthusiasm, kindness, and a smile - she even takes the time to ask us about our life and follow up on conversations we had during our last visit. We really love being regulars here and look forward to coming by the restaurant to pick up our meal and say hello. If you live in the neighborhood and want to support some of your local businesses, I definitely recommend giving Slicey's a try.</text>

Don't go to Dominoes or Pizza Hut, they are advertising cheap specialty pizza, but we can agree that it's often too greasy, cheese seems like plastic and or our bodies feel gross after eating it. But now that I have found Sliceys. Rare to find such an all-around delicious and humble pizza place that isn't only staffed with some of the nicest people but also that they do their menu well. Every time I go in and grab a pizza, I'm fully satisfied with the uniquely tasteful and perfect thickness to my pizza dough and crust. The sauce isn't overwhelming which leaves all the flavors being compounded into the party of toppings. Hawaiian, well,some thinks it's a blasphemous pizza, i think it's flipping legit! They do it right at Sliceys. I've had the pepperoni (fav) also, not too greasy and delicious every bite. In ktown, best pizza place.</Text>

<text>5 stars for SLICEY'S PIZZA.
I love how the top layer of cheese get crispy. I'm not a huge fan of pizza in general and typically eat 1 maybe 2 slices, but when its 5 Star pizza, I'm taking down 4 at the least. No complaints.< /text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<text>The actual pizza was good... I got a half supreme and half BBQ chicken.  The crust is on the thin side so a large would feed about 3 people (2 really hungry people). The pizza took a while to get out even though it didn't look like there were many orders on front of mine.  The restaurant is very small so if you want to done in during a busy time you might have a long wait for a  table.</text>< Pictures>

Great pizza and very friendly service. Highly recommend their Carnivore pizza for those meat lovers :) A bit bummed that I moved out of the area recently, but always enjoyed the pizza every other month we had it. Their shop is a bit on the small side (but they have a neat action figure collection), but since we lived close by, we always did take-out. They also have a parking lot with ample space every time we dropped by.</text>

Shorter summary: Daughter of an exceptional Korean specialty restaurant, she can make exceptionally tasteful pizzas at exceptionally young age, except that the business hours may not be so reliable.

Okay, so this pizza joint is run by the daughter of the most famous specialty restaurant in Koreatown.

Let me put it this way.

To Koreans living in Los Angeles, if I give my address they do not know where I live. When they put my address into the google map, they still don't know where I live. But as soon as I speak the name of the specialty restaurant - they all knew. All Koreans knew. To some Koreans, they simply come to Los Angeles for her mother's restaurant. And Slicey Pizza is right next to that sanctuary.

And whenever I passed by it was closed 90% of the time. So I always wondered the nature of this pizza shop. How come it's closed all the time but still here? Why don't the Korean restaurant buy this pizza joint and expend and accept more customers so I don't have to wait on line for the lunch hour? That kind of stuff.

Then, I ran Airbnb and I realized that my Airbnb guests loved that Korean specialty restaurant(there, you can get super boost to your testosterone due to the exceptionally highly concentrated protein of mudfish embedded with special Korean herbs), I had no choice but to photograph that exceptional Korean restaurant for my Airbnb listing.

That was when I met this early twenty or at the most mid-twenty-ish Korean-American woman who inquired why I was photographing that exceptional restaurant. So I gave her the exceptional reason above, and I inquired who she was. She was the daughter of that legendary restaurant. And also happened to be the owner of that Pizza place.

So I had to try the pizza.

After all, her mother's restaurant just occupies very special place for Koreans in Los Angeles - there's basically sentiment amongst Korean immigrant that original stuff from Korea's better. That could be true, but sometimes, stuff in America could be equivalent or better. Her mother's restaurant defines that claim amongst Korean immigrant and their visitors from S. Korea. That restaurant was the PRIDE for Korean immigrants in LA. And, I happened to just encounter the daughter who happened to be running the pizza joint.

So I had to try it.

And my verdict is - okay, yeah, pretty good. Solid. Yeah, the dough is crisp and there's just the right amount of tomato sauce - making pizza tomatoely and instead of cheesy or oily. And enough cheese and topping to fill for the most part. Homemade feeling for sure. Definitely better than franchise goods or iced pizza. My friends love it, too. So I could easily conclude; just like her mother, the young owner of this pizza parlor knows how to make solid pizza. The nature vs. nurture issue does not argue here; they become twin.

EXCEPT I WAS WRONG.

This pizza place hardly opens. And somehow, at certain extend of time, you cannot even order the pickup from the app. You could have only ordered for delivery and that kind of stuff. So for the last month or so, I tried at least five or six times to order a pizza from here and was not either possible. That freaking app almost gives you - the restaurant will open in another 11 minutes? Freaking bs. I wasted a lot of time. I even ordered from the grubhub once, and I got the notification that it was ready for pick up and when I went there the restaurant was not open. Yup, it was not open contrary to what the app was telling me. I was pissed, so many times. Some of my friends came over with some real good beer, and I wanted real good pizza and app simply freaking pushes the opening hours on and on...

Today, I ordered again, and this time, I called first to make sure that the restaurant was open. It was and as soon as I went there, I was slightly worried that it was not opened, as the sign was off and etc. It was open and I got the pizza and man, it was what I missed in life!

Taste.

If you find it open, make sure you get some. Others, be cautious. They may not be open for the most part.< /Text>

The pizza was delicious. We got a cheese and a veggie. It was only $20 and it was genuinely the best pizza we have had in LA. On the veggie, the mushrooms were extremely tasty and the tomatoes were really delicious. And the cheese was special. We have a picky kid so we usually get a cheese for her. They work rosemary into their (very) delicious crust. It made polishing off the cheese pizza easy. Add in the fact the service was incredibly friendly and this really made our day. Great find. Definitely try it out even if it is a bit of a drive. It's worth it.<//Review>

<Review>If you like attitude with your pizza, this place is the place for you! Be careful, if they get your number, they will call 5 times in row for fifty cents, this was for extra red sauce on the pizza for an order over $50.  A little cray cray! As far as their pizza goes, it’s alright but mixed with a bad attitude, I’ll find another place next time.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2b860363f4567:0xeaf4687129a14166<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Pizza's A quality. They just need to update their prices on their website. Ordered take-out and noticed the cost was higher when paying in person.< /text>

Decent prices, great pizza, and the folks who work here are very friendly and accommodating. They started carrying Mineragua Club Soda and Mexican Coke after a few requests.

My new obsession is their garlic Parmesan wings, I cannot get enough of them!< /text>

I was down in Mid City visiting family from Oakland, Ca. I was stranded and looking for quality pizza at a reasonable price. I called up Sarah, the co-owner of Slicey's Pizza, and she was very friendly, generous, and hospitable. Upon my arrival, the owners then shared local things to do, places to visit, and offered a lot of insight on community development. I felt I was back home in Oakland. The love and respect I received here was note-worthy. I told all my family and friends about the place. Premium pizza, amazing prices, and first-class customer service! I have a place to stop in when I come back to LA.<//review>

Worth a try

The place is tiny but tidy, well-lit, and inviting.  The two folks behind the counter were friendly.  I got the 'date night special' with barbeque chicken; the pizza looked ... pretty, the wings were appealing, and the churros were good for dessert.  It was the perfect amount for us and our 14 year old son (but just barely).

It's like, my people opened a pizza restaurant, and I finally found them :-)

The crust seemed whole-wheat, which isn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad.

I'll be back to try them again.<//Review>

This is not only the best pizza place in the koreatown/mid city area, it is the only one worth ordering from. Their pizza tastes great, fresh, and is reasonably priced. And the service is even better, as it's run by the two most genuinely friendly people you coul meet.<//review>

<Time>1515365980650</Time><rate>4</rate><response>None< /response><text>(Translated by Google) GUESS brand store located in Las Americas Outlet, usually the stores in that square everything is very chosen and mixed, in this store no, I don't know if for the prices not very cheap or because they do not sell anything spectacular.
Very X clothes and accessories for the prices they handle, especially the ladies' bags, too ugly to pay $ 100 plus TAX for them.
Otherwise, sometimes saturated parking and in high season it is a martyrdom to enter and exit the plaza and the San Ysidro area.

(Original)
Tienda de la marca GUESS ubicada en Las Américas Outlet, por lo regular las tiendas en esa plaza todo esta muy escogido y revuelto, en esta tienda no, no se si por los precios no muy barato o por que no venden nada espectacular.
Ropa y accesorios muy X para los precios que manejan, en especial los bolsos para damas, muy feos como para pagar $100 dls más TAX por ellos.
Por lo demas estacionamiento a veces saturado y en temporada alta es un martirio entrar y salir de la plaza y del área de San Ysidro.< /text></record>

Talk about great Customer Service; Connect Hearing is in a league of their own.  Ms. Jennifer you’re awesome and Erica u are a gem and an asset to this business.  Appreciate and thank you so much for all the time and patience you gave to our complicated case (insurance issue).  Your professional attitude and kindness are exceptional and I wish u ladies continued success.  I obviously highly recommend this business and their awesome staff — oh and we received the hearing aids really fast and they work great!!!   Can’t say enough about this place and their staff.   Thank you thank you.</Review>

LIFE-CHANGING!!!!! Jennifer Dixon is a top professional audiologist and the moment I tried on the PHONAK hearing aids I was a convert. But up to that moment I was dead set against the idea of wearing hearing aids. talk about a miracle!!!!!!!!</Text>

Connect Hearing is the best. My wife & I took our 8 year old here, where Jennifer treated us all with both kindness and professionalism. Our daughter received hearing aids which have made her life much more enjoyable and better. Thank you, Connect Hearing. You have been and are a blessing to our family. 💗< /Review>

<text>Excellent experience. I have severe tinnitus and moderate hearing loss. Jennifer helped me find the best hearing aids and fine tuned them over several visits to exactly match my actual usage and needs. Their pricing and purchase options are excellent.

Connect Hearing has been my provider for about ten years. Service is always top notch. I really appreciate the superior communication about my hearing needs and how to best provide what I need. If I need a repair, Monica is "on it" to get it done as soon as possible.<//Review>

Jennifer is an excellent audiologist. My hearing aids fit and function so well I forget I’m wearing them. Janet is very helpful. When my husband’s hearing aid stopped working, she sent it in and had it back to him the next day! I highly recommend these knowledgeable and friendly professionals at the Indian Wells office.<//Review>

<Review>After having a terrible experience with another Audiologist in the area I was thrilled to go to Hearing Connect. The Audiologist Jennifer is wonderful. She listened to all my concerns and needs and suggested the perfect hearing aides. Every time I have a question or problem Janet the Office Coordinator is helpful each and every time. If I need to see Jennifer she gives me an appointment right away. The whole process have been a wonderful experience because of Jennifer & Janet.This is a terrific office. I very rarely give a 5 star review.< /Review>< pictures>

I wish there were adequate words for my appreciation for the Audiologist and staff here.  They have kept my hearing in fine fettle for over a decade and that's essential to me, as I am a therapist!  Perfect personal service, great guidance, excellent follow-up.  Five Stars!</text>

I didn’t quite believe my hearing was in need of aids and worried about the appearance. It’s a great relief to hear everything clearly again. The aids are very discreet and I don’t need to keep asking people to repeat themselves. Thank you Jennifer< /Review>

I am traveling through the area in our RV. Janet was able to work me in at a convenient time to look at my Phonak right hearing aid. That aid will not charge correctly, will not turn green, will not connect to Bluetooth, doesn't always turn on and when it does it lasts an hour or so. Jennifer put it on her machine and says it is working ok and has a 75 % charge. I guess if the machine says it is okay, I must be wrong. I was told the green light is broken. She can send it off for $150 (Phonak cost, not so sure about that, it's under warranty) plus $75 to ship it to another address where we will be in a few weeks. I left with my broken aid, $25 poorer and disappointed.<//text>

I was fearful when we move to the desert and I had to find a new audiologist.  Never fear: Jennifer and Janet are here..  As the son of a Dr. and trained as a neuropsychiatric specialist I am somewhat used to reviewing the qualifications of medical personnel.  This Connect Hearing location has the creme, not to mention the most compassionate and well trained staff I've ever encountered.  Do yourself and your hearing a favor and enjoy the services of Ms. Dixon and her efficient co-worker, Janet.

When I first called I was greeted by probably the most friendliest receptionist I have every encountered, Ashley, she was well spoken, had exceptional knowledge about products and services. She had also was very accommodating with helping me with setting my appointments to the hair stylist I was needing.

When I arrived I was again greeted by Ashley with positivity and welcomed vibes. My first stylist was Makaela who was also amazing and friendly. I also really appreciated that she knew how to work with curly hair and totally transformed my uneven hair to a perfect cut. I also received an amazing essential oil scalp massage.

I went to get my hair colored by Joel. Oh Joel, you truly transformed my hair and my attitude to a more confident and sexy women. He was thorough, he explained everything he was doing well. And I left the salon feeling amazing!!

I am so happy with my experience there and I would highly recommend this salon!! They are all so happy and friendly. It was completely worth the trip to Redding.</Text><resp>None< /resp></record>

<Review>I got side swept bangs and they turned out terrible. I cried when I left. They were so uneven and she didn’t even wet my hair she just started cutting. I had to have my mom fix my bangs never again!!!! Also I made is pretty clear that I didn’t like them too much and she let me leave disappointed. She was also arguing with me when I asked her to add more hair In to make them thicker. She said that it would make my bangs shorter. How? You just add hair and cut it the same length.<//Review>< pictures>

Not the best at males hair cuts but I am also very picky! They also usually will give you a free touch up when you pay for a haircut<//Text>

Being new to Redding, I didn’t know where to go or who to trust with cutting and styling my hair. I ABSOLUTELY loved having Ashley today and highly recommend her and this salon to anyone! The woman that checked me out was knowledgeable on products that may help with what I was looking for to take home and support me with my goal of having my hair be healthier and less damaged. 5 stars all around! ❤️</Text>

Everyone was very friendly. The place is very calming and pretty. Megan did my hair. She was very helpful and answered all my questions. She gave me a lot of good ideas on making my natural curls work for me. It was a great experience.< /text>

I did my research before going to this hair salon. I wanted to go to the place that everyone says is the best. According to good ol' Google reviews,  Boheme was it. So I went. And I LOVED it! I had the best experience I have EVER had in a salon. It definitely was more spa like, hence why it is called a hair spa. All the staff were so friendly and eager to help, you know, actually good customer service! I had Caitlin do my hair. She is an absolute doll! She gave me the best hair I have ever had. Isn't that essentially what we're all looking for? If it is, you need to gry Boheme, you'll fall in love. Wonderful products too, clean and welcoming space. And they offer yummy coffee, tea and water. Such a nice place!<//Review>

<text>Elaina the Hairdresser is awesome.  She listens to what I wanted.  The "relaxation moment" and scalp massage are to die for!  She even shampooed my hair after the cut....the warm towels w/aromatherapy are a luxurious touch...I felt very pampered....I want more!!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Pretty disappointed with how my hair turned out. I went in for a perm, showed a photo of what I wanted, and walked out with very very loose curls and the front mostly straight - not at all what I had wanted. I called back to see what my options were to fix it, and they brought me in, shampooed it, put a ton of product in it, and said I needed to work on styling it. I left with wavy hair that went straight by the end of the day again. I was told it just didn't stick in my hair, but I've had a perm before with no issues (and no need for product to keep it curly all day). They mentioned doing another half perm as a last resort, but I'm not sure I want to go back since clearly they don't think there's an issue with how it turned out.</Review>

She listens to you and then offers great advice, which is just what I wanted.  The front desk and scheduling was also well done, friendly and accommodating.  Will definitely be a regular here.<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Boheme turned out to be a huge disappointment and I won't ever go back. I had a color done and ended up going back to correct it , which they did for free and I appreciated but both times I felt really rushed and the way she styled my hair was down right awful. I was shocked that a trained stylist would make her client walk out the door looking like that. I was thankful I didn't need to stop anywhere before I got home, where, both times I immediately wet my hair and restyled. Elana offered no customer service when it came to listening to my request for my hair. Hopefully I'm the only one who experienced this with her!</Review>

< review>
Went here for the first time a couple weeks ago. I made a hair appointment last minute and was told that the only stylist available was Janie (sp?). As it turns out, it worked perfectly! I enjoyed a wonderful conversation with her while she cut my hair to perfection - and that's not to mention the lovely scalp and neck massage with essential oils and the conditioning treatment. I'm extremely picky with my hair stylists, not because I'm a difficult person, but because my hair is so difficult! I truly have pity on anyone who has to work with my thick mane. But I was pleasantly surprised to find someone who was ready and able to deal with my hair so well. Aside from her incredible skills, Janie is a lovely person, and it was truly a pleasure getting to know her. I will definitely be back soon.</review>

I am so sad about the way my hair turned out. The stylist cut off all the areas I asked to keep the legnth on,  and didn't do what I asked for in the back. I have a pixie cut, so it's pretty important to be listened to when it comes to what I want in regards to the shape.
When I showed her a picture if how I wanted the back of my hair to lock ( when it didn't turn out how I had asked) she told me that that style wouldn't grow out well and that what I currently had was better.  She was very nice, but didn't listen at all and my hair looks terrible for my face shape. I left in tears, and I feel so unfeminine with this cut. I'm sure she's wonderful at her job, because there's nothing wrong with the technical aspects of the cut, it's just not what I asked for.  Also it was more expensive than what their website States and there's no warning until you hand them your card.<//review>

My husband gets haircuts here and they turn out well, but I went here for my bridal hair and makeup and thank God I did a trial first. Ended up cancelling the services for the wedding because the work looked nothing like the pictures I brought in... I asked for curled hair with one braid in the back, which turned out sloppy. The makeup I asked for was simple (even the makeup artist said so), so I'm not sure why it turned out to look nothing like the picture, especially the foundation which was terribly cakey. Ended up doing it myself and liked the results much better, as did my bridal party and the groom. Thankfully I was able to talk to a manager and get a "refund" for the half of the services that I didn't actually receive on the wedding day since I cancelled. Yikes.</Review></record>

<Text>I'm so sad, I went in wanting flowy blended layers and it just looks chopped and not what I wanted I went in a second time to have her fix it, I showed her a picture and everything,  she asked me if I want to keep this length as a v look and I said yes, she cut it a lot shorter than what I agreed to and she gave me the smallest v in the middle instead of a big long v shape for my layers,  she blow dryd it and "styled it" but when I woke up the next morning to really see how it'll lay it still looked choppy so I'm really dissapointed I spent $40 on my cut and I will never ever go here again. I've never been somewhere where they did such a choppy job. Huge Rip off</Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I went there as a walk-in for a brow waxing. It was later in the evening and Ashley, the waxer (I'm sorry I don't know the technical title for her Profession) has already shut down for the evening but totally reheated her wax just for me. Super comfortable room and atmosphere. Great job, totally felt like a pampered, spa experience. Waaaaay better than the standard waxing facilities! I cannot stress that enough, spa experience. Ashley was a sweet pea that I immediately felt comfortable and at ease with. Seriously considering my first bikini wax after being too uncomfortable to do it at any other place.
A couple days later, my guy and I got manicures at the sister location. ALSO a great spa, pampered feeling experience! We're going to book pedicures next week. Highly recommended, we will being going here for all future needs.<//text>< pics>

I have been looking for a new salon to have my hair done and was very impressed with the service provided not only by Ricki (the stylist that did my hair) but the rest of the staff as well.  I have had several bad experiences in the past at different salons that I went to in the bay area so I was nervous about trying another new place.  I am so glad I did.  I have made this my new place to go; I have even made an appointment to go back for one of their spa packages!!!

Made an appointment on the fly and they got us right in. The lady who cut my thick mess did such a great job thinning out and layering my hair and styled it great. All around great service.<//review>

My experience at Boheme has been outstanding! I've been going there for facials, hair color/cut and product for over a year. Natalie knew what I was trying to do and gave me the results I had been searching for and hadn't found even in other Aveda salons (which I've always went to). I've never had such a great chair experience. I always leave feeling uplifted. I also have had facials with the owner - Aly. Wow! My face had never felt better nor have I ever felt more pampered. I've had acne for years and she helped clear me up and advised me on proper skin care. The product line - amazing! Damage Remedy does for my hair what the stuff on the shelves of the health food store can't all while being the natural products I love! I highly recommend Boheme to anyone and everyone! Great people the place!< /text>

I can't say enough about the amazing experience at this salon. I was immediately drawn to the salon because of the Aveda products and having previously gone to Aveda salons while living in San Diego for four years. This salon continues to prove why I stand by their training and their products. The staff is amazing from the always peppy greeting from the front to the professional and bubbly demeanor of my hairstylist, Jana. I've been going here for two years and every time I leave I am more than satisfied and refreshed from the experience.<//review>

I am getting married and chose to get a true radiance facial, and false eyelashes put on. Ashley did both my facial and my eyelashes and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!! She did SUCH an AMAZING JOB!!!!!! My skin feels like butta, and my eyelashes are without a doubt the BEST MONEY EVER SPEND!!!!! Ashley took her time to make sure everything was perfect!!! Very thoughtful regarding my skin as to NOT breaking out before I get married, AND to discuss different possibles regarding the length and look of my lashes!!!! SHE CARES!!!!!
I cannot give her enough props and hype!!!! She may be young, but she is SO well versted in skin needs and what products are best for those needs!!! A++++++ for Ashley and A++++ for the spa!!!! It wasnt as expensive as expected, but I still spent as much as I would have just tipping Ashley!!!! SHE DESERVES IT!!!! Thank you Boheme Spa and Ashley for making me look AMAZING for my wedding!!!!!!!</Text>

They fit me in with no appointment. In less than 30 minutes I was in a chair, which was very impressive. My stylist Mikayla was absolutely amazing. She knew exactly what I wanted after only one explanation, I know it must be difficult to interpret exactly what a client wants but this girl was a pro. She colored my hair perfectly and cut it just the way I like it. The price was very reasonable, I was served beverages while I waited, and I was amazed at how expedient this stylist was at her craft. Very talented. Loved the whole experience. Definitely will be making boheme my new regular spot, and hopefully mikayla can be my stylist everytime!

The products work really well. The results are immediate. I think that’s the difference between this product and over the counter products. After one day of use, I literally look five years younger.< /review>

I had used this product before I bought it a few times in Europe.  I bought it again at arden mall and it was a very bad experience the saleswoman a young woman who says she is from Egypt sold me a totally different product from the one I was looking for.  The quality of the product I think has changed over the years because the product that I bought is a product that really burns my face. I do not sincerely recommend using more gold gold products.</text>

<Review>Walked in to the store and I was greeted right away! I love to come here to buy their Deep peeling gel. I noticed a difference in my face right away, my face felt smoother and pores looked smaller. The staff there was very helpful and friendly. I DEFINITELY will be buying more as soon as I run out.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The people that work here are super friendly! Some are also bilingual for anyone who doesn’t speak English. I went in to the store and they had great costumer service! I’m Hispanic and I was able to speak to them in my language without a problem. They don’t try to track you down and sell they actually care about the product going to the right costumer! Great place I encourage people to go here!</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It is so hard to get off my face that I have to scrub my face to get it off, which isn’t healthy for my skin. These fast talking sales people are super pushy and I will never go in one of these places again.< /Review>< Name>

<text>I was pulled into this store by a man with an accent. He asked me what kind of moisturizer I used and before I could answer, he was leading me to one of the vanities he had in his store. It was a matter of seconds before he had me sitting in a chair, explaining his product to me, talking my ear off with flattery and such. He showed me this cleansing gel that would immediately clean my pores as long as I used it once a week. Then, before even asking me if I had any allergies to anything, applied the gel and a cream to my skin. To sell the “magic” of the visit even further, he told me he’d throw in multiple things for free, all I had to do was buy the gel for $178 +tax. He even gave me a card for a free facial, saying he was the manager, and that we just wanted to make me happy. He called me things like “friend” and asked for big hugs. All in all, he was very friendly and made good conversation, but the biggest problem came when it was time to check out. Long story short, my bank declined the purchase because they have the store flagged as a scam in their system. So, when an attractive, foreign man at Orogold offers you a deal that seems too good to be true, don’t waste your time.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

She supposedly gave me a deal.   As I was about to leave,  that Michael guy stopped me to show me some eye stuff.  He said it was 5.95, and threw in some free stuff. After I paid again, I left,  ended up lookingat the receipt.   Thank God I did because it wasn't 5.95, it was 595.00.  WHAT!!! I quickly returned to return the product.   They tried talking me into a voucher, but after saying no a few times, they gave me a refund.  I won't be going back to that place,  because it's very hard to get out of there, and it's way to expensive.< /Text>< pictures>

<Date>1559936396943<//Date><text>Sitting outside watching these pushy salesmen pestering women to get them to buy stuff. One guy said to a group of women and I quote, “Are you the Charlie’s angels?”, that must be annoying. Then another guy is asking all the women who walk buy, where did you get your glasses because they look good on you, then saying Hi gorgeous! Where did you get your sunglasses from, can I see? How annoying it must be to be a woman walking by this store in the mall. Geez guys should stop being so pushy.<//text>< username>

I came in and she gave me a free demonstration of scrub and anti wrinkle cream that would work perfect for me. They were very busy with customers and she gave me her full attention. Never did I feel pressured to buy but the product sold itself, as I instantly saw results. The store was clean and the prices are very fair! I have been using the product for 2 weeks and I can already see a noticeable difference in my skin. Thank you orogold for your hospitality I will always be a customer!!</Text>< Resp>

I WOULD GIVE A ZERO STAR IF I COULD!  HORRIBLE STORE AND HORRIBLE SALES PERSON!!!!!!!!  THERE IS A MALE WITH AN ACCENT AT THIS STORE NAMED MICHAEL., HE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF YOUNG FEMALES.  HE IS A FAST TALKER AND A PRO AT LURING PEOPLE INTO THE STORE AND PROCEEDS TO DO A DEMO ON YOUR SKIN BEFORE ASKING AND BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN THINK! HE THEN CLAIMS TO GIVE YOU A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE HE IS THE OWNER, THEN PROCEEDS TO RING YOU UP BEFORE YOU KNOW WHATS GOING ON! NO REFUNDS EITHER....WHAT A SCAM!!!!</review>

Similar experience to what others have reported.  I was pulled into the store by Michael.  He was extremely sweet.  He was a touch flirty and charmingly abashed when he heard I was engaged.  He asked me a few questions about my skin care routine and then demo'ed the exfoliating gel.

I had mentioned that my skin is VERY sensitive, and he claimed the product would make my sensitivity go away.  I didn't believe that, but figured it was worth a try to try the product anyway.  It did exfoliate quite nicely, and I was seriously considering making the investment.  However, Michael kept ramping up the aggressiveness of his sales pitch.

I don't make any large purchases without talking to my S.O.  It's not an independence thing, it's a respect thing.  I am terrible with money and my S.O. helps me make responsible choices.  I also ALWAYS wait about 12 hours with new products to make sure I don't have a reaction.  But Michael wouldn't listen when I said I wanted to take some time to think about the purchase--which at that point was a "discounted" bottle of gel for $178 and some "free stuff".  He said he wanted me to be independent and empowered.  Um, okay.

I also don't tend to have large amounts of money in my account--learning responsible spending habits starts with baby steps!  I was at the mall for a specific purpose and had to make sure I had enough to cover those purchases.  When I informed Michael that I didn't actually have enough to cover the cost of the gel--even at his "discounted" price--he asked me, "How much do you have?"

I don't think a salesperson has ever been so rudely, blatantly greedy to me.  I literally ran out of the store.  I will not return, and I recommend that others approach this store warily.< /text>

<text>I had a great experience here today.

Was shopping with my wife at the mall and walked by here for the first time last week.

We were greeted by funny and positive people who were handing out free bags and what looked like lotion packets.

At first I waited outside while my wife got her face done.
However, my wife convinced me to step into the store.

Orogold gave me some lotion for my hands when I sat down on their comfy chairs.
It smelt good but I don't usually use lotion so I'm not sure how it effected my hands.
The definitely felt soft so I figured they did their job lol.

However the mask they gave me is why I wrote this review:

We bought two masks that were on sale.
When my wife and I came home, we tried them while laying in bed.
It was sooo relaxing.
They were so good we went back this morning and bought more.

We used it today before our pregnancy photo shoot at the capital.
Definitely glad I did because my face was hella dry lol.
A great place stop at in the mall!
5/5 stars.

Awesome store and amazing people in the Arden mall.

Definitely worth the visit!!!!< /text>< Pics>

<Text>If I could, I would give a negative star. When I was passing the OroGold store at Arden Mall, CA the sales man that stopped me was a manager of the store (according to his name tag). Told me he was the owner of the store and that he 6 other stores, was super pushy and kept on giving me crazy discounts. Basicly for for half the price of one bottle, he gave me 2 bottles. Kept on saying u look like u can use this and ur skin desperately needs that and so on and kept pushing me to buy things... I'm easily convinced, so I bought it and was told that I will b able to return it for full refund if I wasn't completely satisfied. Well I came home, was all excited to try my new super expensive face products that promised me so much... after a few uses, my face started getting swollen and peely. I wasn't able to use anything on my face. The skin became tight and red, I immidiately stopped using the products, called the store and was completely disapointed. I wasn't able to return it at all, they did offer me a discount on my next purchase or to bring my bought products to the store and exchange them for another product. But if I had an allergic reaction, why in the world would I want another product from the same store?? Salesmen are super pushy for u to buy, discussing customer service. Can't wait for the entire company to close down. I am using Origins and Im really satisfied.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The best Mexican food I've had. Authentic Mexican food not tgat commercial taste. The a special Quesadillas are like no other . I also love the family that owns the place. When my family visits this restaurant after driving 200 miles they always make  us feel at home. A Must try .</text>

<text>Best.Mexican.Food.Ever!  I lived on the base for over 7 years in the 90's & I ate there regularly.  I still go twice a year on vacation to see friends & always eat at Celia's.  There is no other Mexican food better on the planet!  My favorites are the Special Quesdilla, Machaca Plate (dry) & I love their beans, rice & guac.< /text>< pictures>

Not sure why this is so popular.  Food was very bland.  Chili verde was very tastless.  Rice was cool and no flavor.  Beans also cold and just powdered cheese.  Had much better mexican food elsewhere.</Review>

It's been a while that I've eaten at an Authentic Mexican Restaurant. Not to mention it's in my neighborhood, real close to our home. We ran into it one day, just walking by, going to a local market. My boyfriend and I decided to listen to the aroma coming through the area, calling our name. It's something we don't regret.The staff were all so courteous and friendly. The food was so delicious! A taste that reminded me of being young and in my grandmother's kitchen. I recommend the taco plate... Something I always order in any restaurant as a test to check the authenticity. The beef was so tasty, the right amount of salt and garlic. Tacos fried medium, with beans and rice.The Guacamole is also excellent! With homemade fried tortilla chips, it made my dinner complete! My  boyfriend's chili colorado plate was his favorite. So thank you Celia's Restaurant for having true Mexican Food and having a wonderful chef, and of course your friendly, hard working waitresses.<//text>

<Text>Great food, tastes great, machaca plate was excelente.
Meat was juicy and spanish rice was warm.
Service was excellent, fast and waitress was polite.
The restaurant has easy access to the Street, plenty of parking spaces, and three entrances to the parking lot from Imperial Avenue, Adams Street, and Barbara Worth Street.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Service is fantastic!! But the food was relatively bland and mediocre. The refried beans were very good. The Chile Colorado I had was also pretty tasty but I've had better at other establishments.</Text>

I really did not like the food to be honest. The service is great yet the food not. I got the #3 plate which has a taco, sope, enchilada, chile relleno, tostada & frijoles. I asked for it because it has most of the things they mostly serve there, but it was not good. The only things I liked was the taco, and the sope. The tostada did not have meat, the enchilada sauce was not so good and the chile relleno semed to be from the day before. The chiles rellenos at IVC are bomb just letting you guys know lol 😂 also they do not have a viarity of food. They have been open since 1994 they should have a more extended menu and more drinks of course. Not going there any sooner.</text>

I've lived in the valley since before Celia's came here.  When my family, relatives and friends first started going here, the food was good, but service was non existent.  If you want a refill or any other item, forget it!  The waiters/waitresses will not only not come back to your table, they seem to purposely avoid looking your way so they don't have to be called over for assistance.  They don't greet you when you come in, or thank you for your business when you pay and leave.  I went in today with family after a few years of eating at another better choice Mexican Restaurant in the valley (El Zarape in Imperial, Ca.), only to find that refills are no longer free, there's a charge for sharing food on your plate, and there's a charge for to go containers.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  I don't know of another restaurant in the valley that does this!  We called the waitress over after getting our chips and drinks to tell her we were leaving, and where most businesses would ask why to make improvements, she had a care less attitude and didn't even want to know why.  We won't be going back, ever!!!  There are too many other quality restaurants here in the valley who value paying customer's business by giving free refills, free to go containers and free sharing, not to mention GREAT customer service, so there is never a need to support a GREEDY business that has the attitude that they could care less!!!  Take my advice....avoid this place like the plague!!!!!  Go to El Zarape, it's great!< /review>

Really liked the special quesadilla and chile reyano sauce. Wasn't a fan of the enchilada sauce. The prices are fairly low, but they have a lot of "extra" charges (i.e. no free refills, charges for more chips) that can add up.</text>

Want chile rellenos? This isn't the place for them. Hot plate, greasy egg wash, not as warm cheesy center... hmm, microwave maybe? The shredded beef and sauce used for the beef enchiladas was good though.  The service was inconsistent. Polite and attentive up front but inattentive mid meal for refills, napkins, dessert, etc... Want Mexican food? Go eat somewhere else if you can. I wouldn't go eat there again unless the party I'm eating with absolutely wants to eat there.< /text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>The food is ok but not authentic. Since the majority of their customers are anglo, they alter their recipes to them. That's fine but it takes away the authenticity of mexican food.

I think most will agree that service is very lousy unless you are a regular customer. Don't plan on sharing your plate either, the waiters and waitress's will tell you that there is an extra charge if you do.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Another surplus store dedicated to America's heroes. Super friendly staff and awesome products. This place is a great pitstop to check out.

I'm retired military and it was such a pleasure to walk in this morning. It's been about 28 yrs since I've been in there. Their supply and displays are a 5 star and can order online as well.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Stop buy they have everything you'll need I promise you.< /text>

This is a good place to get some great stuff  and if you wish, you can also buy pins and patches. They also have a selection of knives to choose from. Plus, for you veterans, they also offer veteran's discounts.</text>

I've been shopping here for years!  Amazing inventory and they have some of the most unique items,  both new and surplus. Its shocking how much amazing stuff is housed under their roof.  To top it off, the customer service here is exceptional. Ask for Jonathan,  and if you are current or former military,  LE, or first responders,  they'll give you 10% off to thank you for your service!  I love these guys.< /Text>

Distinctively American store. All kinds of military surplus (as you might imagine) however the place is packed to the rafters with historic artifacts, new knives, survival gear. Shirts and other clothes with attitude for men and women.< /review>

By far the largest and best quality pocketknife collection in the Monterey Bay, as well as a solid array of your general surplus store goods. I've always thought surplus stores were pretty cool, and they seem to be less abundant these days vs in the past. So I try to support these guys when I can. Also have some paintball stuff, which is a sport I'm trying to get back into, so that's cool too.</review>

Definitely go check this place out. Just walking around is fun for the curious at heart. Got some coin hats for my sisters and some spy glasses, definitely going to stop by again. Staff is friendly and welcoming.
Do yourself a favor and stop by.</review>

<Text>A must visit Monterey destination for outdoor and survival gear. Staff are knowledgeable. I needed a small machete for backpacking; went to 3 stores that only carried 1 type. At J&S they had multiple options at great prices. If you ever driven by it and wondered if you should stop. The answer is yes.<//Text>< rating>

First off I'm a veteran so I love this store.  Generally I would have given this store five stars every time, I always enjoy myself there. This time though I put some stuff behind the counter cuz I want to look at other things. When I went back to get everything one thing was left out so they got four stars instead of 5 cuz I didn't get to bring my coffee mug home with me other than that thumbs up to this place to.<//text>

Its more like it just scrounges up random items and tries to sell them at a insane markup, but i guess the memoribilia is pretty cool.

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Stopped by here after eating at Phil's fish market, heard I had to check this place out. We spent about an hour here looking through all the storage containers filled with odds and ends. Some very interesting history here, such as old radio equipment and electronics I've never seen before! Tons of ammo containers and old uniforms! Two things impressed me the most: first their knife selection is huge! Second they have a duece and a half on the property and it's for sale!!! Staff was very friendly and there was more here than I could discover in one visit! The only reason for the four stars instead of five was the pricing. Prices are pretty high, but I like to support small businesses!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><user_name>Kyle Lawson</user_name></record>

<text>Way overpriced like 250-300% more than online. I knew it would be more expensive, but I was expecting like 50-150% at most. I was also specifically recommended a set of throwing knives that broke on their first use. I called them but they would only refund me if I came on a certain day which I couldn't do. I've been going to this place since I was a kid, but now realize to never buy things here, although it is awesome to look around. Some of their surplus stuff is alright, bought a bunch of movie props there back in the day, but avoid knives, axes, airsoft guns, etc, etc, etc.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Prices are a little steep but overall a nice place with a lot of history. If your offended by items their then you need to grow the hell up and stop being so sensative. It's a part of history.

<Review>Great store, huugee selection of everything you could possibly need for camping. Also they just got a new paintball and airsoft guy, and he does repairs IN STORE! Can't wait to come back, always a favorite place to stop. Some things can be expensive, but you're paying for quality items so it's definitely worth it.<//Review>< Pics>

Excellent variety of goods and friendly helpful staff. Great place for hikers, fisherman, backpackers and the out doorsy types. A little over priced but a great place to get an idea of what you might need or be looking for.< /Text>

Swastikas and confederate flags. It's like a tribute to forces we've beaten. If I had taken my grandpa in there, he'd have been embarrased. Is this what we fought for? How many swastikas are sold in a year? Is it worth it? If you looking to gear up for your alt-right interests, this is your spot.< /Review>

Instead of spending too much at traditional stores, I'd suggest going to this Surplus store first.<//text>

(Translated by Google) A place with everything you need for the hunt, and of course to acquire some personal protection weapon. I saw different shotguns and sports rifles like 22, of diabolos for sport shooting. Military style clothes, boots, knives, knives and if you need ammunition for your personal defense weapons in that same place you find it. Good treatment and friendly service

(Original)
Un lugar con todo lo que necesites para la cazeria, y por supuesto para adquirir alguna arma de protección personal. Ví diferentes escopetas y rifles deportivos como  22, de diabolos para Tiro deportivo. Ropa estilo militar, botas, navajas, cuchillos y si necesitas municiones para tus armas de defensa personal en ese mismo lugar lo encuentras. Buen trato y servicio amables</text>

Wait time was a little longer than usual, but they had a lot of mobile orders coming in, so were extremely busy. No worries though, I love the smell of fresh brewed coffee. :)</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80940b9c16454ff7:0x81e9d40e67c4c0d7< /gmapID></record>

Saw my food and drink sitting on the counter yet he instructed me that he would be with me in just a moment. What's the point in ordering hot food if you're going to make me wait 20 minutes to be able to get it?<//Review>< pics>

Starbucks is starbucks either way you look at it .. But an understaffed starbucks is hectic especially if you can't mobile order. Better have patience just saying.  P.s 25 minutes from order to getting my 3 drinks.   And FYI the guy  said sir there are other drinks in front of yours. So I told him you are giving drinks to people who ordered after me  and 3 minutes later my 3rd drink arrived.<//Review>

Best Starbucks location in Madera by a wide margin. The staff are always friendly, drinks are made quickly and consistently, and the atmosphere is much better than the other locations. Plenty of space that's conducive to getting work done or meeting up with others. Grateful to have this location in our city.</Text>

Most Starbucks that I visit have pretty good service, based on my experience.  The Madera branch on Howard Road is no exception.  I went in for a simple coffee so that I could do some work at one of their tables.  Since they were brewing a fresh pot at the time, the barista was kind enough to bring it out to me a few minutes later when it was ready.  Very pleasant attitudes by all of the staff there!!  I'll be certain to visit again when I'm in the area.  Keep it up, folks!</review>

Very slow. Drinks were fine, but they were short-staffed or something on the day I was there. Took 10 minutes for me to give my order when only one party was ahead of me.</review>

My daughter ordered a drink they made it wrong and then told her they didnt have anymore to remake her drink and didnt even give her a refund when she asked for one they said it wasnt their fault they made it wrong and ran out of product. Usually we always go here and this hasnt happened before but this isnt right for what they did.< /review>

I love the service, I receive at Howard location in Madera CA. I especially like the evening crew, they know my name and my favorite drink. I feel like they are part of my family. This Starbucks is the best, that's why I go at least once a day.<//Text>

<Review>The sinkhole that opened up in the street has not slowed down business here.

The service level is what you would expect from a Starbucks.

Do not sit facing the parking lot. The sunlight glare reflecting off of the parked cars is a real drag on the eyes.< /Review>< rating>

They have the recipe down, and business as usual. But we believe in supporting local. Small coffee houses</Text>

This is a very uncomfortable location. Between the cold, the acoustics, and people popping in and out from lack of a drive-thru, I cannot tolerate being here longer than 10 minutes.< /Text>

Always good service. I'm new to ordering via the app and had an order not go through (operater error lol).  I was sitting at the starbucks waiting for my (unordered) drink for a while and a male barista recognized that there must have been a mistake and ended up saving me so much time by having it made in the fly!  Thanks guys!</Text>
