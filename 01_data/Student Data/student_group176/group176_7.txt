I was so excited to have a choice other then Frontier in our area and even more excited when I heard so many great things about Succeed. I put in my order last week and today they came and did the install at both my business and home, I can’t say enough good things about Gabe and all of his hard work getting my new internet and phone up and running. Thank you Succeed and thank you Gabe!< /Text>

Gabe was great, very professional was very thoughtful in asking about dish placement and doing the least amount alterations to my home. I can also say that this service is more than 500% better than the service I had with digitalpath, save yourself frustration and money choose succeed...</Text>

Succeed.net services my residence, my business, and my neighbor's residence.  Their internet connection is much faster than my wired connection at my previous residence.  I would recommend them to anyone who struggles with internet connectivity in rural areas.<//text>

<Review>So I was having problems with another company, I called because my neighbors are VERY happy with their service with succeednet. I like that they are local so I can support businesses in my community.  Cody came out today to install new service for me. He was great, answered all my questions & let me know what he was going to be doing. He was very respectful. He also made sure my devices connected to the internet before leaving.<//Review>< Time>

Been with Succeed.Net since it was Pulsarco.Com. They continually upgrade their equipment and service with out raising prices. If you live in a rural area, their wireless service is the best.  High data limits and very good speed for the cost. The few times that I requested support, they were responsive and completely solved the problems.  Highly recommend!</text>

I have had succeed.net for 10 years  or more . I live in the foot hills and I am lucky to be able to get your fast service from a tower behind my home near Oregon House. when  I have   had a problem I have called your customer  service People and they get right on the job and fix the problem in a very timely manner .  The price is a little more then I would like to pay but it is worth the speed I have . I can stream and watch Netflix  no problem  and that is when my wife and kid are also on line.  Thanks Steve W.</text>

James was my wireless installer, and he was amazing!  He explained every step of the installation process and was very patient answering my bazillion questions.  My internet connection is strong and the upload/download speeds are impressive.  I shut off my Comcast Xfinity account (after being an Xfinity subscriber for over 10 years) the very next day, and am happy with my decision. Keep up the great work, James and the rest of the Succeed.net team!!< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I searched for 8 different ISP and the only one that seemed like it could come close to Comcast, which is what I was coming from, was Succeed.net. I called and spoke with Michael on 2 different occasions, about a week apart, and he was very helpful. Michael even informed be about business options and speeds which was very helpful. The tech that came out was Tony. My wife was home during the install to accommodate the dogs around the tech. She said he was very nice and professional. He made sure to connect everything and he also made sure the connection was at its best. He ended up extending the pole the dish was on to improve the connection. I am very satisfied with Succeed.net and would highly recommend their company for anyone within range of their towers and who has Satellite connection to give them a try. The speed and Latency they offer is impressive compaired to Traditional Satelite internet. Thank you again Succeed.net.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1597505323638, 'text': "Thanks for the review Ryan.  I'm happy to hear that you are happy.  It's hard to match a cabled connection, but fixed short range wireless is the best technology that's available.  We are using the latest models on all access points and towers and we upgrade as new tech comes out.  We hope to be able to offer 100mbps or higher service in rural areas in the next few years for similar prices based on some new technologies and frequencies coming.  Stay tuned!"}< /resp>

<text>Suceed's technical support and customer service are excellent.  I am always able to get a person on the phone, and the technicians take time to listen and understand my issue.  They promptly return calls, and have always been able to resolve my technical support requests.  Great team, great service.  Highly recommend them for your IP needs.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
Went through the steps to set up home internet here over a week ago, they showed it was available for my home. Plugged in the next 5 days for best times to set things up. After over a eeek if no contact, I reached out to them to see what was going on and was informed they could not supply internet to my area. Scumbags wasted my time, don’t give them money.</Review>

{'time': 1529627784094, 'text': "We humbly apologize for any lack of communication that you did not receive in a prompt manner.  You should have been called or emailed within 24 hours to be told if your location doesn't qualify after a manual sanity check.  Our service uses radios that require a clear line of sight between a wireless radio dish and one of our towers so unfortunately not all locations in the coverage zone can get service. I think we found the communication problem internally and are fixing the apparent communication failure so it doesn't happen again.  Fortunately you were not charged anything during any part of this process.  The problem with your location is that our service requires clear line of site between a dish mounted on your home or building and to one of our towers or hilltops.  Unfortunately you appear to be in an apartment and they are more difficult to service due to restrictions on antenna mounting, cable runs, etc and in many cases being lucky enough to have a porch pointing in the right direction.  We are working on a low cost gigabit fiber solution for Apartment complexes in the area coming later this year, but the apartment owners will have to allow us to build these in a partnership.  Very sorry this was frustrating sales experience before you even could become a customer.  We will work to improve this."}</resp>

< Review>
I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! Meridian Day Spa is what I would imagine heaven being like. The baths are relaxing, the rooms are clean and warm and the therapists are skilled. I've been coming to this place steadily for three years and I've tried many different therapists and have never once been disappointed. I feel completely confident in their hands. I hate to do this in such a public forum but... Meridian Day Spa, will you marry me?</Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>The best way to describe me after an hour-long massage at Pho-Siam is "satisfied".  Forty dollars for a Thai massage is a STEAL!  I don't know how these lovely ladies work all day long because they really do put a lot of effort into the sessions.  I felt so good after I left my cabana that I just wanted to crawl back inside and fall asleep.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>The receptionist, young lady with a lot of tatts, was very friendly from the fist time I called to make the appointment.  She explained the check-in process, several times since I was having a 'blonde moment' and didn't understand getting prepared.  She gave me a clear bag with a robe and flip-flops, told me how to secure my belongs and the aesthetician called me when the room was ready.  She was very polite, answered questions, shared few stories and I felt comfortable.  The whole experience was very nice and for the $99 microderm and facial plus 5 hours to the pools (small), sauna, steam room,  and theater room was a pleasant surprise.  Def would do it again.< /Text>< pics>

If I could give a lower score I would by far the worst place to play black jack. If your a true player stay away they got $5 to $25 tables with rotary shuffler, pay commission of $1 per hand and on top of that black jack pays 6/5 your odds of winning here are the worst your better of buying a lotto ticket.<//Review>

Meridian spa is very reminiscence of a Korean spa but with a pretentious fancy facade. I can't fault them on their decor, as it requires a few photo opts with the upside down tree that is suppose to act as a chandelier. The interior designer gets a A+ but whoever the manager is needs to really double and triple check on the quality of everything else !

I walked into a room upstairs to lay on a typical massage bed that seemed to be the ones massage students use to practice on. The room was freezing cold and the 3 different sheets that were suppose to act as"blankets" did nothing to make the goosebumps on my body go away.

A huge no no in massage 101, is to have a Cold hand touch your warm naked body as you lie there naked in the freezing cold room.

I didn't understand the process of lifting every single THIN sheet up one at a time wasting about 2.5 minutes each time of my precious massage moment! I sound annoyed right? Well , tell me how you would react when you have goosebumps all over your body! How can I be relax in a cold ass room with cold ass hands rubbing you down with cold ass massage lotions? When the shaking body wasn't giving her a clue i was cold, I decided to say it out loud... She than added on with another thin ass sheet that added on to my sheet flipping time!< /Text>

<text>Great place for a Spa, I saw some bad reviews but people should be less naive with expectations.
This place gives a great Spa pressure points and around joints. This is a more relaxing massage than therapeutic.
The special right now is $30 bucks for an hour, which is a awesome deal.

I took one star away because the person giving me my massage answered the phone a couple of times, not a deal killer considering this is a small shop and both people there were busy but still an annoynace.

Definately coming back and definately worth trying if you haven't been.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Hidden gem in the middle of Los Angeles. Uber spa quality everything at crazy low prices. Have been coming here for a while, so worth the drive for this quality of massage. You can park for free or valet for $2 - crazy cheap. You'll be blown away if you visit it for yourself.</text>

Horrible customer service. Been here a few times now and staff has been friendly and helpful before but not tonight. The lady at the front desk (on Wednesday night 3/14/18) was rude and threatened to charge my card when I was upset at the bait and switch I was given. I had bought a Groupon a couple years ago for a special deal and was denied by Meridian to use it because they sold out on that deal. Really?

All this because of an expired $79 Groupon I bought a couple years back (right before I was pregnant & delivered my baby). The deal I bought the Groupon for was sold out but we were not told until after the purchase. So I lose $79 because you could only accommodate so many people and deny the deal for rest of us? I was told to come back for any service and use it since the cash value on it is still good. No refund given by Groupon so I had no choice but to hold on to it until the next good deal. Fast forward to today, I called to set up a reservation, for tonight, for the $95 massage/facial special. Cool, I can finally use my cash right?

I reserved also stating I would be using my expired Groupon value since it states the purchased amount on it is still valid to use. I was not told I could not use it. I was not corrected. Had I been told No, I would still be upset but I would not have booked the services or just booked the massage. I have a new baby and do not have much time or money to go out. They (tonight's manager via phone) claimed I could not use a coupon with a coupon.  An expired Groupon is not a coupon. NO DISCOUNTS were ever given or applied here. It's straight cash.

The fact that I was treated rudely and swindled out of my money by being forced to pay AGAIN for the services originally booked as a combo. Twice now. NO deal.

So they gave me 10% off the 2nd service after using My Groupon to pay for 1 service and was forced to pay the 2nd one at full price. 10% off is taxes. How is this a discount?

I still tipped the ladies that provided my services because I enjoyed my massage and facial. I wouldn't deny them their well earned tips. However, my afterglow was marred by a business that does not know how to treat their customers. A shame too. I liked this place.< /text>

I seen the employees just wiping down the bath tubs with a towel and no proper sterilized cleaners!!!!  gross don't waist your money! water containers aren't even washed everyday seen the same dirt mark the second time I went "DON'T DRINK THE WATER'...!  My husband said he saw the "Supervisor" ""BEN"" laying in the Netflix room instead of cleaning SMH.... How responsible is that. No towels in the women's spa and robes are kinda see through and old. Heard the ladies in the front desk talking about customers while I was sitting in the lobby waiting on my husband to come down very immature and unprofessional.... I believe that's what threw me off I will definitely go somewhere else...< /review>< Pictures>

<text>I absolutely looooove this place! It is my favorite restaurant! I drive 45 miles just to pick up food from here. EVERYTHING is delicious, fresh, good for the tummy and soul.  Although, my must have is always the Tom Yum soup with the soy Chicken replacement instead of Tofu. Not to mention, they have the freshest, most authentic Thai tea with coconut cream. Simply what the body needs and taste buds.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

H.O.P.E is our all time favorite vegan thai restaurant in LA and we have been there over 40 times. Their taste is exclusive and definitely well blend with fresh organic veggies. Sea weed roll, Pad thai. Pannag curry, spicy mint noodles are amazingly satiety & full of flavors.</text>

Even in LA, it is so hard to find places I can dine at. With my chronic health challenges, I’m avoiding a lot of harmful ingredients and H.O.P.E. is one of the only 3 restaurants I feel safe dinning at due to their substitution options. And substitution DOES NOT reduce flavor one bit! I get the Spicy Noodle and veggie soup.

Also to note, Postmates screwed multiple times tonight forcing the restaurant to deal with this inconvenience. The chef was so helpful, empathetic, and professional. I’m so happy that I can count on this place.<//Text>

Amazing food. Wonderful staff. They even babysat our 3 months old. The flavors are authentic Thai and you can’t even tell the chicken and beef are vegan. Def recommended.< /text>

<text>Amazing vegan restaurant with a central location. The menu is versatile with different multi cultural vegan diet that is suitable for all season. The restaurant also offers lunch and dinners combos. The portions are big and the food prizing is fair. The beverages menu is unique particularly the organic lemonade with ginger! Customer service is very friendly and food preparation is quick. I highly encourage vegans and non vegans to drop by this place.</text><user_id>111534951562588909820</user_id>< gmap_id>

I’ve been eating here for 5 years now and i don’t know why I haven’t left a review. Hope Thai is the most delicious restaurants in studio city. So good I order from them at least once a month. Dining in or ordering take out it is consistent and always amazing. I’ve tried so many of their dishes; Kai Ga Tiam (my favorite), roti dip, steamed dumplings, Muay Thai wings, pad Thai, nachos, spicy noodle, Mac n cheese, all of it is TASTYYY. You’ll never be disappointed eating here. I wish I could give them 10 stars.</Text>

I ordered delivery from H.O.P.E. and was very impressed with their dishes. Light, vegetarian, and absolutely delicious. I order a bunch of dishes and my family loved it. I would highly recommend it. Give this place a try.< /text>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>***** MOST DELICIOUS VEGAN THAI IN LA *****

I’ve been coming here for years with family and friends and meat eaters and vegans love this place equally that’s what makes it such a great place you know it’s never lacking flavor!!!

Might go to order:
- fresh rolls add avocado ask for a peanut sauce and hoisin sauce and a side of chili paste to make it spicy!

- Green curry dumpling appetizer
- Mui Thai wings (spicy) 8 out of 10 level!
- kale and quinoa salad!
- crispy Orange chicken (SOOO GOOOD)
- pumpkin curry with roti bread!
- Fried banana spring roll! + Add the coconut ice cream with chocolate fudge!
- fresh coconut
- Thai tea with coconut cream

The owners are very humble and kind always had great service and a great experience I miss dining here!!

Be sure to directly support if you can please pick up food and save restaurants around LA delivery applications take up to 30% and it really hurts! :)

Amazing vegan food, probably the best I've tried. Each dish was very flavorful and the synthetic meats taste very similar to the real thing.< /text>

<Time>1578971105045<//Time><resp>None< /resp><Review>H.O.P.E. is an Asian inspired restaurant which brings its flavors and implements them so well that it makes me feel like being back in Southeast Asia and having dishes that bring me back there are the curries. There’s something to a curry that blends all the spices and ingredients together to make this paste combined with coconut milk to bring the sweet and spicy together like a marriage. The combination of the products that burst with flavor that hit all your senses to wake them up and embraces your flavor profile.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2be07e233af91:0xddb3ce9b066f16fd< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>My favorite restaurant in the area! It’s great for vegans (which I am), but I take all my non-vegan family and friends here too and everyone loves it. The prices are fantastic for LA and it is quick to get in and out. It’s totally a hidden gem. My faves are the mac n’ cheese, the orange chicken, the curries and the new “fish” fillets. Oh, and the Tom Ka Kai soup. Really, everything is amazing. Parking can be a pain, but it’s worth it.<//text><Rating>5< /Rating>< userid>

<Review>As a family that keeps kosher and eats vegetarian out, we are delighted to be able to eat everything on this menu... and when we go out to Hope, we *do* eat everything on the menu.   as a young child, our son mistakenly call this restaurant Joy. It is an apt name. our kids are always excited to eat here, and when we are done we leave full and happy.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2be07e233af91:0xddb3ce9b066f16fd<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>H.O.P.E. kitchen is an all vegan thai food place with plenty of tasty meat substitute and gluten free options for every diet. Okay, full disclosure, H.O.P.E. stands for “Healthy Organic Positive Eating” which is just the other side of new-agey for my general comfort level so I was a little skeptical going on…but everything we had was delicious and we weren’t made to answer any “questions of the day” or required to order our food using words that indicate what mood we were in…so great start!

We started with the crispy chicken side-dish. This was as good as any fish and chips dish I remember having…the “chicken” was battered in a gluten free batter, and was tender on the inside. Although it was more like a fish dish as I said, it was super-super-delicious and I started to fantasize about adding a lemon squeeze and some properly cooked fries and, done!  This is crave-worthy

I had, from the House Special menu, the Kai Ga-Tiam & Sticky rice. This was okay, but the side of sticky rice it came with was not my favorite sticky rice ever (it was a little dry to be sticky), and the chicken was a bit over cooked and reminded me of vegetarian “beef” I’ve gotten elsewhere. The broccoli this came with was perfectly cooked, and the hot sauce it was served with was nice in moderation

My wife had the See-Ew (gluten free) which I tried a little of and we both thought it was among the best tasting “Pad See Ew” dishes we’d ever had. Again with perfectly cooked veggies.

Our kid who has more basic tastes got a Veggie Lovers with “beef” on the side. The beef was a little too crispy and dry, and he didn’t like it. He did order it on the side and we think it might have been better cooked with dish so it was moister.

They brought our side of brown rice on the side in the shape of a heart which made us feel the rice loved us. :)

Everyone was friendly including our server…and we liked that the menu, which we already knew was all vegan, had labeled each dish that was gluten free.

There’s plenty more to choose from here with an extensive soups, starters, noodles, curries and more sections of their menu…I’d come back based on crave-worthiness of the “Crispy Chicken” (Which I’ll forever think of as fish and chips) alone. (and they do have french fries to so I can roll my own!)</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5Ez-wsTturvlfY_gtg42rO5TWNH8Qfrefrdpj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnp0H8_oj5cjvSLDhZTdcmhra32bMTNdbSmOPa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsXdrQBdN1Dr_FCG4UsFO6LpCXCR-7qqlpCiC2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIXF66NV5xvzQt_VbBqmgEgHIPpIkAVhaCvibO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDq9jQndkx3mXu7ApfA8BeV3ITl2e-7XnH2_zU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3rKcCDf-_cNj6hH98I7U4wOhAwLMnhtUhitQ5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

Highly recommend. The place is on the smaller side so it can get pretty busy. Only downside is that it shares parking with Lala's so parking is either via valet or street parking. I say it is worth that inconvenience<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>Ordered delivery last night, and was pleasantly surprised. The food was exceptional, with delightful flavors. The green curry was amazing! The chicken choices were incredible, and the very berry smoothie was delicious. It was delivered in a reasonable amount of time, and they got the entire order correct. It was a big order, so I was impressed by their accuracy. The food was still hot, and it was hands down the best vegan place we have ordered from. This is now our go to vegan restaurant for Asian food.</Text><gmapID>0x80c2be07e233af91:0xddb3ce9b066f16fd</gmapID>< pics>

Placed an order through grubhub, the driver went to the restaurant and didn’t pick up the food because it wasn’t ready and he goes off to do another deliver. You’d blame the driver/ grubhub but once you put in another order 15 minutes later the restaurant cancels it.
Okay okay fine. But after i sent another order for pick up, i arrived at the location (1.5 hours later) they gave me my forst order that was eventually cancelled. Now i’m eating my stone cold food because at this point i’m starving. Get your act together HOPE because this was not the first time.< /review><Rate>2</Rate></record>

<user_name>Zach Gor</user_name><text>Excellent vegan dishes with many delicious options to choose from. Standard Thai restaurant fare is served with a twist, and it tastes really good. I strongly recommend the Curry Dumplings—along with the yellow curry tasting sublime, the dumpling's texture is so moist that it melts in your mouth along with the creamy filling.<//text><UserId.>115551881872866310808< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

<review>This is a really awesome vegan Thai place.  I've been here several times and have never been disappointed.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  The food is amazing!  I highly recommend the Muay Thai Hot Wings.  I've taken a few non-vegan friends here and they've really enjoyed it too.  They do lunch and dinner combos that come with a salad, rice, and a spring roll.< /review>< Pictures>

The food is so good, I still have to think about the "beef" with beans 😃
The staff is very friendly, especially the waitress from Alaska, a very lovely person! Would definitely recommend<//Review>

<text>I made H.O.P.E. my new "home". At least once a week I must to go there to eat the spicy buffalo wings  and the beef-less jerk and tried a new vegan gluten free dish every time. Its so awesome to have a vegan with a lot of gluten free options place to go, with a very very nice atmosphere, the decor is wonderful. There's valet parking for $6 after 5 pm and paid street parking before 8pm.< /text>< Pics>

One lucky evening had us stumble into this piece of Heaven on a cloud of sheer bliss. We had gone to Universal Studios for the day; and, being Vegan at such a general public establishment was torture! We were hangry! Yet  once we entered this authentically welcoming refuge, Patrick made sure that we felt at home. That night  we devoured their menu options. How does Maude create such mouth-watering flavors? Wow! From this night forward, H.O.P.E. is our all-time go-to for everyday life celebrations. The quality of the food, service, and overall ambiance is beyond compare. Plus, their prices are great! We are hooked for life! We found our new family filled with H.O.P.E. Brava Chef Maude! Brava!</Text>

<review>I'm not a vegan and usually avoid vegan food but this place was good and I would eat here again. That is saying a lot already. Did not like the mac and cheese. Some people said it reminded them of lobster bisque but i thought of cardboard. The lunch and dinner special food was enjoyable and did not seem super vegan-ey< /review>< Pics>

Highly recommend this vegetarian/vegan fusion thai place. Dishes are creative and the plating memorable. Taste is quality! It has won awards in the past. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Parking's limited but I've parked in other lots on a Sunday without issue.</text>

I love me some H.O.P.E! my go to lunch every time my friends come to visit me at work. None of my friends live in the area so therefore this place is the perfect spot for me to treat them and it never Fails. Food is always delicious, service is always great, never do I leave here disappointed. :)<//Review>

The food is so delicious. You have to go back and try everything. I'm possibly addicted to the beefless jerky and pad se ew, but I've heard wonderful things about the curries and other noodle dishes. Staff is lovely, particluarly Patrick and Iana. The inside is cute and cozy, too. Could not recommend this place more. Go eat here!</Text>

<text>I was there for my daughter who prefers to eat vegetarian. I didn't really even want to go, but I'm so glad I did. This is basically a Thai restaurant of very high caliber and  I didn't miss meat at all. The "beef" product was incredibly good in both texture and flavour and so was the chicken. I'd go back happily any time. So very good!!!<//text>< UserId.>

Unbelievable. I worked right beside this very unassuming restaurant for 6 years and never tried it. I have been blowing it. Hard. This is some of the best Thai I've ever had. Its a Vegan paradise... I got the kale and curry quinoa w/ soy chicken... The Curry recipe is out of this world. Service is great. Atmosphere is warm and comfortable. Definitely coming back here all the time.< /review>

The past couple of times we ate here with my friends, most of us got severe diarrhea.  Not sure if it's the food or sanitation issue.  Another thing we observed was that their servers are always picking up trash from the floor with their hands including other people's used up napkins and then they immediately serve your plates with their thumbs in your plate.  That's just gross!!!!< /Text>

<Review>Best place Ive been to! Ive been to Thailand and this is just like that. Modd the owner was our host and also served us the best tasting dishes Ive ever had. Shes beautiful, funny and cares about her customers. Her husband seems cool too! Get there ahead of time to find street parking if you want to avoid vallet parking. That lot gets packed. :)< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I absolutely love this place. I cannot get enough of H.O.P.E. I have been here several times and have been checking off my list of menu items. So far I have had the orange chicken, the Muy Thai wings, the hot wings, the pumpkin curry, the green curry, spring roll, and salad. I seriously cannot get enough. I have enjoyed all of it. The orange chicken I did find to be on the heavily breaded side, but I can't say I still didn't eat it. It's a big shareable portion. Really, this place is delicious.</Text>

Best Thai food EVER!!! Everything was so amazing. The curry dumplings were WOW. I really wish I could have tried more food but I don't have much of an appetite. The Thai ice tea is definitely the best I have ever tasted. My standards for Thai food are so high now thanks to this place👍🏼<//Review>

< Review>
I am from out of town and am not vegan but I am seriously considering it after my experience at Hope.  Every single thing we ordered was absolutely amazing!  All different flavors and spices.  Do yourself a favor and check it out. Very reasonably priced too!<//Review>

What a great find! We just had the most satisfying meal. Healthy food with enough variety, well spiced AND using super fresh organic produce- really couldn't ask for anything more. The setting was comfortable but not fancy. Prices were very reasonable too. Only complaint- the parking lot was jammed on Sat night, but they have a quick valet. This will become one of our go to places to eat out.< /text>

<Text>Tonight I came out here with some longtime friends and had a leisurely, restful meal. We shared several dishes, and would especially recommend the pumpkin curry and the mango rice for dessert. The mango was truly one of the most ripe, delicious mangos that we have had in years. We would highly recommend this restaurant for people who want to be leisurely and focus on enjoying flavors and nutrition in a clean, simple setting.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>I only went here because my friend has been trying some new holistic diet, but I can see how the restaurant was earning a high score.  Having never been to a vegan restaurant before, I was a bit skeptical.  I had the pineapple fried rice and it was quite good.  My friend tried one of the salads, I don't remember which one, but she said she really enjoyed it as well.  All in all, a pleasureable experience.<//review>< Rating>

<Review>So I order their 3 chicken tacos, and it was the worst experience ever. Specifically when tacos have a simple and easy finger food reputation to eat. But NO! My tacos had so much lettuce, tomatoes and cheese that it overwhelm the presentation of a traditional Taco. It literally was messy to eat that I just couldn't enjoy 3 simple tacos.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1539752543071, 'text': 'Dear Jay,\n\nThank you very much for visiting us at H.O.P.E.

I am a heavy meat eater and I loved it! We had it delivered but it was still awesome. I recommend getting the Pad Thai with soy chicken or the Curry with soy chicken.<//Review>

If you're looking for high quality organic vegan food, this is the right place to be. Every single dish thay we tried (wings, orange chicken, yellow curry) tasted superb. And if that wasn't enough, the customer service was fantastic beyond my expectations. I'm glad I've discovered this place and I look forward to coming back again.</Review>

<text>My friends and I like the food here, but we really don't enjoy watching the person serving our food literally grabbing trash and other people's nasty dirty napkins off the floor and then going straight into the kitchen after that to serve our food while their contaminated dirty hands are swimming in our curry and inside our plates.  Get someone to sweep your floor with a broom and make sure they are not the people serving our food.  This has happened way too many times, and that's it for us.<//text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Everything was well seasoned and delicious, and also really cheap. The food had consistency and pleasant bite - a good example that even vegan "meat" can be processed into authentic dishes. We were there twice and would gladly come back!

Alles war gut gewürzt und sehr lecker, dazu auch noch  wirklich preiswert. Das Essen hatte Konsistenz und angenehmen Biss - ein gutes Beispiel dafür, dass auch veganes "Fleisch" zu authentischen Gerichten verarbeitet werden kann. Wir waren zweimal dort und kommen gerne wieder!< /Text>

<Time>1467769209195</Time><rate>5< /rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Great place !! I'm relatively critical when it comes to a restaurant - but it definitely comes down to 5 stars.
Beyond the excellent service, fast and hot - the food was amazing !!! At a really high level. I am personally vegan and really enjoyed it, and my friend is not vegan and also really fun and impressed (and he is more critical of me when it comes to food that is not meaty)
I really really recommend !!!!!!! Whoever comes in - recommends eating the banana dessert fried - it's not deep frying but still crisp and melted.

(Original)
מקום מעולה!! אני יחסית ביקורתית כשזה מגיע למסעדה- אבל לזה בהחלט מגיע 5 כוכבים.
מעבר לשירות המעולה, מהיר וחם- האוכל היה מדהים!!! ברמה ממש גבוהה. אני אישית טבעונית ונהניתי מאוד, וחבר שלי לא טבעוני וגם ממש נהנה והתרשם(והוא יותר ביקורתי ממני כשזה מגיע לאוכל שהוא לא בשרי)
אני ממש ממש ממליצה!!!!!!! מי שמגיע- ממליצה לאכול את הקינוח של הבננההמטוגנת- זה לא טיגון עמוק אבל עדיין פריך ונמס.!<//Review>< name>

<Text>There’s a barber, first seat at the right when entering in the barber shop. He doesn’t wear a mask while cutting peoples hair theirs also a sign saying that everyone must wear their mask upon walking in. He clearly didn’t listen. This is not the first time I’ve seen this he needs to get a ticket.< /Text><response>None<//response><userid>116514665883924679372< /userid><GmapID>0x80dd35a89b23356b:0x451d8b9e39b45211</GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

This is a nice little plaza with a 99 cent store, Domino's, liquor store, Chinese food, nail salon and even a work source place, so it's pretty unique.<//Review>

terrible place, everyone has an attitude and treats you like garbage. favoritism goes on between certain usual customers over those just needed a haircut. they lack quality in trying to cut your hair and are too busy with the tv they have in their and random chatter back and forth.

Their prices suck even for how retarded they attempt to make at cutting your hair. your better off going some place else then waste your time at this hole in the wall place.</Review>

Stood at the front counter for 10 minutes and was ignored. Sat down thinking there was some kind of informal line or something. Watched every other person get served, in addition to a few people who walked in after me (regulars I'm guessing). After 30 minutes of being completely ignored, I left.< /Text>

<userid>115817980871462475675< /userid><Date>1542919011011<//Date><review>(Translated by Google) I went to get my hair cut on thanks givig day and as expected it was packed. I have been to this place before but today it was my turn for the lady who is on the left at the back of the place to cut my hair. First she was all sick with the flu that did not take even the slightest precaution to even wash her hands after touching her nose or even covering her mouth. Well, the problem was that the lady barbera "professed" when she was cutting my hair, I started to believe that if I was going to let my hair grow, that at least I would take care of it according to her, well the old lady continued and continued until the point where she I said that he would only dedicate himself to cutting me that was what I was. Immediately after seeing her said that, she finished cutting my hair and the truth was that everything was wrong, nor did it seem that a professional cut it off. Now I understand x that this lady has no clintes. If this is read by the owner or manager of the place, it would be good that they call your attention or something about it. The other bibs look more professional than that lady.

Fui a cortame el pelo el dia de thanks givig y como era de esperarse estaba lleno . eh ido antes a este lugar pero hoy me toco que la senora que esta a la izquierda al fonde del lugar me cortara el pelo. Primero estaba toda enferma de gripa q no se tomaba ni la mas mina precuacion de tansiquiera labarse las manos deapues de estarse tocando la nariz o de cubrirse la boca tan siquiera. Buemo el problema fue que la seño barbera "profeciona" al estarme cortando el pelo me emposo a critar q si me iva a dejar el crecer el pelo q por lo menos me lo cuidara segun ella bueno la viejilla siguio y sigui asta el punto donde le dije q solo se dedicara  a cortame el q a eso fui. Inmediatamente deapues de averle dicho eso ella término de cortame el pelo y la verdad quedo todo mal nisuiquiera parese q me lo alla cortado una profecional. Ahora entiendo x que esa señora no tiene clintes. Si esto lo lleguaa leer el dueño o manager del lugar seria bueno q le llamen la atencion o alq agan algo al respecto. Los demas babrberos se miran mas profecionales q esa señora.< /review><GmapID>0x80dd35a89b23356b:0x451d8b9e39b45211< /GmapID><pics>None<//pics>< rating>

< review>
We just love this place for the below reasons:

1. John and Eric, and their technicians - how professional they are, and the clean and neat service they’ve provided.

2. The price is fairly low compared to the BMW and Jeep dealer (we fixed/maintained both of our vehicles here). Oil change, tire fix, etc.

3. The parts they provided were authentic - don’t ask me how I know I might have less hair left but I have eagle eyes.

4. Professional is professional - all were wrapped up and cleaned during the COVID time. Rest assured.

5. John dealt with things thoughtfully - now the service reports (receipts, fully detailed inspection notes) along with the appointments were confirmed and shared electronically.

How is this not as good as BMW/Jeep dealer? It’s closer to my location, it’s clean, it’s fast, it’s as cheap as it can be. It is even better.

Full disclosure: I am NOT writing this review with any coupons! LOL. I wish this business “long and prosper” so I can always go to John when I broke my BMW/Jeep.</review>

Anyway I ended up bringing my car to University Tire and I couldn't be happier. They are transparent, outstanding work in parts & labor  (pictures that helped me understand about cars), excellent customer service and most importantly they deal with that insurance company that was stressing me out. I am definitely coming back. My car looks like brand NEW!<//text>< pics>

<text>Brought in my 2008 Mazda after realizing that the brakes were not working as well as they should. After a thorough inspection of my car, they diagnosed other critical problems that I was very thankful to have them bring to my attention. After their quick yet excellent work on my car, I feel much safer and more confident driving it now. John and his team are friendly, professional, and above all, always looking to give you their honest opinion on what is the best for your car. If you're in the USC area and need your car serviced, I wouldn't look anywhere else besides University Tire and Auto.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Our daughter recently relocated to Los Angeles, and we knew at some point we'd need to find a qualified mechanic for her car. We didn't plan for it to be so urgent, but when her brakes needed immediate replacing, University Tire and Auto Service took care of it. Unfortunately, the wheel lock had been lost from her car, so they had to deal with that big inconvenience before even starting work. They did so, and were professional, helpful,  communicated with us frequently, and left us knowing we now had a qualified local repair shop for our daughter. We highly recommend them.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1615821415456, 'text': "Thank you, Teresa!

< Review>
I was searching around for a place that would be able to replace a flat that I had received from an accident the night before. I was stressed because I don’t know the area, I called a more well-known company and they weren’t able to help me. I called here and they immediately told me to come in and that they would be able to replace my donut with a new tire today and I wouldn’t have to wait for another day. As soon as I came in they immediately helped me, replaced my tire and I was good to go after about 30 mins. I am so thankful for the friendly and quick service I received, and will gladly return if I am in the area again! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!<//Review>

<Review>This was the worst experience I’ve had in any auto shop.  I would not recommend  anyone to come here. The reason is because  I went in to fix my breaks spent over $2500. When my car was fixed and I took it home I noticed the front wheel was lose. I took it back, got it back, they did not resolve my problem plus they messed up my battery. Now I need to pay more for those repairs, not to mention they did not take responsibility. I haven’t ride my car at all because it is not mobile whatsoever.  Worst auto shop ever!!! Expensive, waste of time and does not meet customers satisfaction. Do not recommend!</Review>< Pictures>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>I can’t complain enough about this place. Do not bring your car here. I took my car in for regular oil change service in the summer. When I left all my service light indicators were still on. I called and they assured me it had been done so I let it go. I spoke with the manager this time to ensure proper service, and he assured me they would take care of it and also check my engine lights to pull the codes. After leaving my car there for almost five hours causing me to miss an appointment, I picked the car up and the engine codes were not checked, I did not get the inspection report until I asked for it (they usually tell you before they do anything) and a day later my engine coolant alert (which should have been topped off during the oil change) has come on saying I need to add it to my car. Had to take it to another service station two days after paying them. Never coming back here or giving them any more money.< /Review><response>{'time': 1612295956872, 'text': "Alexsandra, we're sorry to hear you were dissatisfied with our service.

Nice guys. Clean. Don't go here for anything important. Just throwing money away.
They're good for quick fixes, get your oil changed, new wipers, not much else.
You'll  be overcharged for unnecessary parts and the work that is necessary won't get done. Offer free diagnostic, they couldn't find anything with the free version, charged for a better diagnostic, they still couldn't figure it out.
I brought a used car in for a general diagnostic, check engine light on, wheels constantly losing air, A/C problems, bad handling and suspension.
Over more than 10 visits and over $1,000 wasted all these problems were still problems. ALL!
Unnecessary parts were replaced at the highest parts and labor rates. Unskilled mechanics couldn't diagnosis or repair any of the real problems. Finally got the car to better shop and got results and fixes.</text>

<Review>My partner and I just moved to this part of the city, and immediately needed a slew of car service. University Tire was well reviewed, so we took both our cars in, and they did not disappoint! Very fast, professional, and they guarantee many of their services with warranties.

They’re not the cheapest, but you can trust that they’ll do the job and they won’t upsell you with peripheral issues. Really happy to have them in my hood!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>This is actually 4.5 star review. I've taken my car to John several times over the last few years and now that I'm back on this side of town, I have found myself turning to him again. He's a good and honest mechanic. Prices are a bit high sometimes and they can get busy, but they've always taken good care of me. Thank you!<//Review><response>{'time': 1606747506308, 'text': "You're very welcome, Chae!

Took my care to this place and ask for a simple alignment and for a body quote to replace a door. As Ali said simple right? Except it wasn’t. I would told by De’ontea that my car could not be aligned because the tire was too far out and that a body shop would have to repair this issue before any alignment could be done. What a coincidence they have one. I was promised a repair and quote from the body shop the next day. No surprise that didn’t happen. When the body shop finally contacted me. Stating there was nothing wrong with the tire from the body side. Meaning It was either a mechanical issue or I was lied to. When speaking back with the mechanic he wanted to change me $500 dollars to look into the reason again. I declined and asked for the alignment, I originally ask for. I received a call two hours later. Stating my fairly bad tire was flat and that couldn’t do the alignment. That is unless of course I payed for new tires before. This place is not about its customers, only money. Seeing how they charge you for every time they lay a finger on a car.< /text>

OK, these guys are fantastic. I went there on recommendation from somebody in my office building after having frustrating experiences going to the "big box" auto repair place nearby. I couldn't be happier. Jaime is a master mechanic and will never steer you wrong. Frank is an honest and engaging owner. The prices are always reasonable, and the work is done well. It's also done quickly! I can't recommend them more highly.<//review>

University Tire & Auto Service absolutely gives top notch service. I had to bring my car in to be repaired after an accident and they took care of everything and helped me out with the car rental and my insurance company. Peter, Aaron, and Johnny were so professional and helpful. The entire crew at University Tire & Auto Service is friendly and professional. They explain everything in detail from start to finish and keep you informed of the progress. I highly recommend them!<//Review>

Worst place ever!!! Do not come here, I went in with one problem my car came out with multiple problems. They charge a lot and they do not take responsibility for what they damaged. Better off taking them to the small local auto shops.< /review>

<Text>In my opinion this is the most professional alignment shop I've been to.  While the price per alignment in other shops range fron $50 up to $70 ... here is a little bit more but it's well worth the extra bucks. In addition, the alignment is performed to factory specs and the technician test drives the vehicle before returning it to you along with the print out of the alignment results. Definitely way superior service than other shops around.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Went in to see what leak my check engine code was referring to and they fixed the issue in a timely (albeit expensive) manner. Definitely worth the money for the speed, professionalism, and quality service. Dropped it off on a Wednesday afternoon and it was ready for pickup the very next day (Thursday afternoon).

<Text>Took my car in on Sunday , I was the first car In. I had some leaks in my engine. The gasket was leaking as well as my car was misfiring. I have an old car 2007 Chrysler that hasn’t had much big work done to it from its last owner, I saw the reviews with university tire online and decided to give it a shot. I wanted my car to be touched by real professionals and I wanted the job to be done quickly. Which university succeeded in doing so. I Took my car in at 8:00 am and it was done by 2:30 pm. The great thing about going to this place is they actually care about your car , they give you suggestions on what you should up keep to keep your car running beautifully. If you’ve already gotten what they suggested to your car repaired then you’re already one step ahead. I was helped , listened to and service was quick and my car is running beautifully. The only thing is ... it’s expensive , but hey I like the finer things anyways, and you pay for the service you want. Any other mechanic would’ve kept my car for three four days. Thanks y’all !</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>This is the second place I called when I found a flat. They had great weekend hours and were able to pick me up some uniquely sized tires. They’re also in the area, which was important because my EV was low on power when I brought it in. They explained everything clearly over the phone before I arrived, which helped me make an informed decision on service. Very kind and professional.</review>< Pics>

I made an appointment to get my tires replaced, and when I arrived I also requested an oil change, which they accommodated with no problems. They even inspected my car for free and fixed the problems that were starting to occur with the vehicle. Everyone was really friendly, and the service was great! They also have a great use of technology so you can store/access everything digitally. I would highly recommend!< /Review>

The crew was professional and prompt with the repairs. I received text alerts at various stages which made me feel like I was a priority for them. My car looks great, they definitely went above and beyond. I will be coming back for any future repairs.</review>

<text>Yesterday I bought a vehicle from a dealership. Today I found out that dealership was shady (see dealership review under my profile).
After finding out the dealership I bought the car from completely lacks ethics, I was of course concerned about the shape of my car, no longer willing to take their mechanic's word for its condition.
Knowing that I have 5 days to return the car, I called up Sunset 76 for an inspection. They got me in same day and were done in an hour. They were able to give me peace of mind that the 5 year, 20k investment I'd just made wasn't a lemon. Cannot thank them enough for that and will be back anytime my car needs something, highly recommended!</text>< Rate>

<Review>I had walked in to ask for price and they were able to help me out without my car being there. The guys at the front were friendly and informative and quoted me $450 when at Toyota they were asking for $633 for tires and alignment. Obviously I went with this establishment and the price was only a bit different from original quote and they were super professional. They also informed me that I didn't need the alignment that Toyota was pushing. I would definitely come back here and recommend to others.< /Review><rating>5</rating><username>Linda Alonzo< /username><pics>None</pics></record>

The ability to replace hybrid batteries at a reasonable price in LA hard to find. The dealer wanted 3 X more for the same job.

I found JP Auto Body Shop on Yelp when AAA recommends Chilton (I read the mismatch paint review on yelp so I will stay away.)  Thank you fellow Yelpers.  JP Auto Body is superior!  Everyone in the shop knows each other's customers.  When I pull up the rental car on my pick up day asking the guy where I should park, he knows my name even though he did not work on my case.< /Review>

<review>After an oil change at my Audi DTLA dealer, I was advised that there was a number of issues with my vehicle due to wear and tear. The estimate was over $5000. Luckily, I had warranty on the vehicle and University Tire & Auto Service was one of the listed partners they worked with. I had the pleasure to work with Erick and Deonte throughout the process of looking into what my warranty covered and didn’t as well as what actually needed to be done on the vehicle as a second opinion. Both of them were very professional in allowing me to drop off my vehicle for a couple of days and provide me with details on costs of repairs and labor covered by my warranty company as well as my out of pocket costs. After everything, it took less then a week to repair 4 major issues with my vehicle and only paid $460 of the $4,800 total cost and $280 was to diagnose the car which my warranty didn’t cover. Overall, great communication from the team as well as results. I wish I could do more than just write a wonderful review but they will be the first I go to for any issues or needs in the future. Highly recommended! Thanks again Erick & Deonte.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>5< /Rate><Resp>{'time': 1602100586812, 'text': "Hi, Mike! Thank you so much for taking the time to review us.

The first time I came here, I was a litte shock to see the Owner at work with his employees.. That's is trust and respect and communications with each others.. .. So, I trust the relationship they all have with one another.. This is my third time coming here because, I need something else done on my car.. I try looking else where, but it I didn't feel the realness of the company that I was going to.. So I when back to the Professionalism and they did a great Job on my car.. That's guy, I really appreciate y'all and I will be back and I will let my family and friend know John and his team are honest, loyalty and trustworthy..<//Text>

<review>I am very disappointed about their service system as well as the attitudes towards customers - it is about trustworthiness and responsibility.

I needed to replace a splash shield. When I ordered the service yesterday, I wanted to make sure that the new part would be genuine. So I asked the front desk about it and he said it should be genuine. However, when I got my car back, I found that the part was a third-party product (OEM) even though the invoice said it is a genuine one.

I complained about it, and the manager said it was a miscommunication. This reminded me of another issue that I experienced several years ago. At that time, I ordered several services including replacing wipers. When I got my car back, a similar situation happened. I found that the wipers were not replaced even though it was charged. I complained about it and the same manager said it was a miscommunication. What a coincidence!

I did not want to believe that they did this intentionally (because I am an international student, not a native speaker). However, if the miscommunication is repeated, it means that the service system is seriously problematic. Furthermore, the manager did not apologized for the inconvenience that they made to me.

I claimed that they should replace the splash shield with a genuine part. The manager promised that he would replace it by today. I will watch how they are going to handle this issue, and I hope I can receive a sincere apology from the manager after he fixes everything.< /review>< pics>

The good: Brought my vehicle in after getting rear ended and was greeted immediately by one of the staff members. Everyone I spoke to is very nice and willing to help when asking for updates, asking questions etc. The professionalism is there, giving you a sense of security in the work. It took just over a month to complete the repair, and it was impeccable. Definitely worth the wait. Very impressed with the attention to detail, and quality. They even cleaned and waxed the whole vehicle. It looked off the lot. I had previous damages to the vehicle and they were able to get more than I thought possible fixed from a previous claim. John, the owner, is great and happy to explain the process and what's happening. No condescending or dismissive behavior whatsoever.

The bad: Some of the updates I received via email were a bit poorly written and had to call in to get further details. I wasn't given a clear idea of the timeline but with the steller results I can forgive that.

The ugly: Nothing.

In a nutshell, love this place. They are reputable, great to work with, and have the quality to back it up: highly recommended.< /text>

I have been to this place a few times for Wheel Aliment.
They do an outstanding job in a reasonable time at a reasonable cost, the guy on the service counter is a nice guy, and he does find what a customer wants by short conversation, I am very thankful for that experience led skill.
I highly recommend everyone who needs quality wheel and tire service.< /Review>

My car was hit but covered by their insurance. I had my choice of repair shops but chose University Auto. I love being able to utilize neighborhood services. They are very professional and helpful there. I would recommend them to anyone. My car looks brand new again and I am extremely pleased with the way they took care of everything. Thank you again John. I used to take my car there when it was owned by Mr. Kim. I am sure that he too, would be pleased that good service is still available at the corner of 29th and Vermont.</Review>

I got a flat about a block away from here on MLK day and AAA was going to charge me $90 to just change my spare tire(I had already used up my 4 services for the year😳).  Luckily I remembered there was a tire shop down the street and was able to get my tire replaced with roadside warranty for just a little over that.   The owner John and his staff went out of their way to assist me in saving me money and found an alternative way to safely get my vehicle to their facility without having to get a tow.  I greatly appreciate the time they took to assist me and find the other option for me even though they were very busy on that holiday.   I would greatly recommend this facility for their amazing customer service and cost.  Thank you again☺</Text>

Without hesitation I highly recommend this place! Genuine people who are honest and down-to-earth. They are willing to go the extra mile to make sure you are taken care of in everyway. I called in and ordered a sideview mirror for my car, which was ready and waiting the next day! I arrived without an appointment and they immediately put someone to work on my car while I waited. As a courtsey they even washed and vaccumed my car, touched up a dent I had, and helped me back out as I left! Finally, the price was nearly half of what the dealership wanted just for the part! Noe, Olga, and Jani rock! I will never visit another body shop again.<//Text>

My car got broken into and my rear passenger window was smashed. I called numerous autoshops and everyone gave me a ridiculous price. I finally got to University Tire only to find out that they offer half of what other places are asking for. They did a wonderful job repairing the window and cleaning up all the broken glass in my car. They were also able to fix my broken headlight without charging me because “it’s just not connected.” They’re running a charity here and I really appreciate the helpfulness and friendliness from all the staff!<//Text>

Service okay. They are friendly. I feel the fee for diagnostics should be credited toward the repair. Audi dealership applies it to the cost of repairs. *From here this edited review is from today's experience (10/16/20), which was a call to the shop to get an estimate for brake pads. Guy who answered the phone couldn't give me an estimate for brake pads without inspecting my vehicle per policy he says. Not sure how the findings of an inspection would change the cost of brake pads. Strike 2.<//Review>

Fast service. Very clear about the costs ahead of time. They send me a full inspection email soon after I dropped off my car and called me to see if I wanna do any of the additional recommend services. Perfect for USC students. You can just drop off your car and walk to campus and pick it up after school- which is what I did</text>

Friendly and professional staff. Prompt service. I was late but they gave me a heads up on the wait (two cars ahead of me). I called my mom to pick me up because I had a Webex meeting and I was on my lunch hour. By the time the Webex started, they called me to tell me it was ready. I didn't need a new tire. They safely patched it up and told me it was safe to do so. The place is pretty spacious and clean. I also liked how the workers had masks and they had signs set up to remind customers to observe the six-feet distance rule as we are in COVID-19 times. They also had the credit card swipe machine set up so as to not have to exchange hands and I was given the choice of having a paper copy of my receipt printed or emailed. I will definitely patronize this business again. They thought of everything. I read the good reviews and am happy to say they lived up to them. This was my first visit and certainly will not be my last.</Review>

University Tire & Service Center has treated me well both times I have been there. I have gone there for repairs and maintenance. The team is very friendly, knowledgeable, and communicative. The prices are reasonable. As someone who is not a car expert, I feel that they explain things well and have my best interests in mind. Logistically, it is helpful that they are located on a major street near public transportation and USC if you need to leave your car. I plan on going back there for my automotive needs and would recommend it to others in the area.</text>

Turns out my transmission was completely shot and instead of just going ahead with the flush, taking my money and sending me on my way, John (the owner) personally called me to explain that because of how bad my transmission was, a flush may not solve the issues I was experiencing and may even make it worse. He let me park my car at the shop for several days before I eventually decided to have it towed to my family mechanic. If I didn’t live so far from them, they would be my go-to shop for all my car service needs. A trust-worthy shop for sure!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I've had several positive experiences with the dedicated and professional staff at University Tire.  Most recently, I had a full brake service on my 2017 BMW X1.  I initially went in on Saturday and Dante was very forthright with me about the scope of the job.  While the warning message on the car demanded brake pads, he informed that the with BMW vehicles, rotors and sensors must also be replaced so that the alert goes away and the vehicle performs at ideal capacity.  About an hour after performing a no-cost inspection, he confirmed that the full service was required, but that all available shops that sold the parts were not opened and I would have to bring the vehicle in on Monday.  During this exchange, I gave him a ballpark budget.  He went line item by line item ensuring that he priced each one at the lowest bid possible, bringing the overall cost to a point where I could not forsake the offer.  I know I saved at least $300-$400 since the dealership would have been way over what I ended up paying at UT&A.  When I went in on Monday, the staff was ready for me and I was on my way to work.  I received a text message AND followup phone call later that day to inform me that the service was complete.  Close to 5 PM, another call came in to ensure that I was in route and they even offered to wait for me should traffic prove to be an imposition.  I've never had this level of attentive care from an automotive service agency ever!  The payment/hand-off was smooth and drama free and the manager informed me that the service/brakes had a two-year warranty that accompanied the vehicle, no matter the state of residence.  Given how auto service businesses can be insufferable, this delectable experience is one I would repeat in a heartbeat.  I unreservedly recommend this place with gusto and delight.  As a resident of the North Area USC neighborhood, I am proud we have business like this to vaunt and share with other Angelinos.</Review>< rate>

I will start from cons because it was only few besides so many pros. Will do my service there since.
I came Saturday for oil change and general check, the crew, John met me first, was very helpful, welcomed me from the moment I entered the facility.
So I was expecting that it will take maybe and hour - hour and half at the most but it took about three hours, wasn’t expecting that but I didn’t did previous reservation so maybe that’s why.
Also I was checking my brake pads and my wheels wrapped in plastidip so somebody did couple scratches on the plasitdip. It’s not a big issue but I preferred this to be avoided in future.
And finally... pros.
The crew is super polite, intelligent, professional and helpful. Really liked that they explained me everything what and why they doing this and that.
Showed for me brake pads, what actually happening with them etc ( I’m myself car enthusiast and know something but they showing you everything and explaining that simple that any newbie will be able understand).
Plus they send an e-report about your car with photos which I found super cool and a relevant.
And the last thing - fare prices and they not trying to add or repair “something else”, straight to the point.
Definitely will continue with those guys.< /Text>

Quite overpriced service. They charge ~$60 for the full synthetic oil change and the other services also are towards the higher end of the market prices. They also have a complementary check which I guess exaggerated the required repairs. It recommended immediate flushing of several fluids while I have done that last year less than 10,000 miles ago and the fluids looked reasonable to me for at least another year.</text>

I've been here for vehicle service and tire repair/replacement couple times. They are friendly people and I love how everythings are always  done by the end of the same day.

Update 9/5/2020:
Been here again before a road trip, nice people, professional service. Although my car is 2016, right now I feel like I'm driving a brand new car. I again enjoy driving now. Truly appreciate it!</Review>

<Review>I bought the set of 4 tires for a van this year. It was going well and after 2 weeks a bubble appear on one of the front tires. I took the van back in and they changed the tire at no cost.

Three months later another tire has a bubble I was getting frustrated and I thought maybe I’m hitting too many curbs but you could see no damage to the tire. I took the van back in and they said they wold change the tire.

The next day went to pickup the van and we received a great surprise all 4 tires were changed. Even though we were frustrated at the beginning what they did was great and great service!!! So we will be back and we do recommend this place.

Thank you!!!</Review>< pictures>

I visited them for a pre-purchase used car inspection. I was attended to quickly and the person I spoke to, Mr. Diante, was very professional. I had an appointment for the base version of the used car inspection. Based on the results, I wanted to decide on whether or not the car needs a more expensive but detailed inspection before I decide to buy the used car. I was suggested that the car is in great condition and I may not need the detailed inspection and I felt so too! I appreciate the honesty and it made me feel great. Also, I received an e-report with videos and pictures to explain the condition of the vehicle. The report also suggested urgent and non-urgent repairs to be done on the vehicle. I found this extremely helpful and Mr. Diante gave me some more helpful suggestions along with the report. I will definitely visit them for all my auto needs once I buy the said vehicle.<//text>

I trust University Tire & Auto wholly and completely. John, Diante, and Al are forthright, honest, considerate, and approachable. The work they’ve done for me over the past seven years has always been top notch, they have frequently gone out of their way to provide exceptional service, and going to a mechanic staffed by people you have faith in is pretty much priceless. I will continue to be a loyal customer.

One recent example: at 55,000 miles, the computer system in my Honda started to give out, due to excess moisture getting into it, of all things. The cost to replace the necessary parts: $1,500. Al and John went out of their way to contact Honda dealers in the area to see if the vehicle qualified for the California extended emissions warranty, as the vehicle was out of both engine warranty and powertrain warranty. Long story short: they took my Honda to a reputable dealer while I was on vacation (!!!) and got the work completely covered. My car is fixed, I paid nothing, and they most definitely provided service that was intensely above and beyond what was necessary. Let's just say I'll be going back.<//review>

<Review>I brought my car in for a "check engine" issue. I think John and his colleagues at University Tire did a very good job identifying the issue, recommending repair and overall being very clear and upfront of the options and associated costs. I have an old car, so I'll likely come again.</Review>< gmap_id>

I had my car service twice work was done excellently but they are way overpriced you could take your car to the dealer and it might be cheaper you must have for a breakdown prior to giving your consent both of my jobs could have been done in one hour each so for water pump cost a $160 a radiator flush to go with it total price of materials $200 plus the labor total 953 out the door that should have cause for $450 Max my 1st time I replaced a compressor $500 for of materials cost me $2000 out the door.

They are reliable the do excellent work And it's great to have them in the neighborhood.< /review>

Friendly service, great work on the cars, thoroughly explain everything that’s going on. They even send you an inspection file with pictures that you can keep for your own records. Their prices are much lower than taking the car to the dealership.</text>

<Text>The service was great. Staff were knowledgable and friendly. My only issue was being (what I feel is) overcharged for a part. I paid almost $180 for a lightbulb that cost $100 in AutoZone. Yes, compared to the dealership, the part is cheaper. Next time, I know to bring my own part(s) if possible and just pay for service.

I will definitely go back to get my car serviced again in the future.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1581434853817, 'text': "Hi, Kimberly! Thank you for providing us with your feedback.

My A/C was not blowing cold nor working, Charlie was very helpful and fixed my ac problem. Everything was checked in detail for leaks,old freon/gas taken out and put in new freon. It blows ice cold now.
Highly recommend this place and the price is affordable for the detailed work they do. Keep up the good work!<//review>

I've been taking my Mazda to University Tire & Auto Service for almost three years now and each visit I am treated to quick, comprehensive, and affordable service. I would highly recommend using them from all your auto needs.<//review>

I had a awesome experience, thanks to STEVE!  We started with a tow set up by our insurance company  in the middle of the night from the freeway to their shop (also recommended by our insurance company).  The tow company caused damages to my transmission during the transport requiring it to be rebuilt.  Steve was awesome!  He worked for 3 weeks with the insurance company to prove the damages were related to the tow incident.  This shop is professional, reliable and very reasonable with their pricing.  They work to help and satisfy the customer and I am so grateful for care and tenacity that was in my best interest!  Thank you Steve, John and Team at University Tire & Auto Service!  Hands down, I recommend this shop to anyone in need of auto service!  Virgie<//review>

I went in because I needed my tire to be patch. I was charged $40 which I considered to be to expensive for a simple tire fix. I’ve been to other places where the charge has been a lot less. To top it off they took an hour to get it done. Very unhappy</Text>

<text>I came in with the AC not working. Got a text message saying that the AC issue was diagnosed and I should call back to confirm the estimate ($308) which I did. Later I get another message saying that actually the compressor is broken and the repair will be additional $992. Now, maybe it's a simple miscommunication, but I work in the medical field and 'diagnose' definitely means that you know exactly what the problem is, which clearly was not the case at the time when I got the message with the $308 estimate. Unfortunately, my AC got misdiagnosed, I paid $308 for nothing and the AC is still not working hence the poor review. Next time please do not overstate in your communications that you know what the problems is when you do not. Saying that you diagnosed is very different than saying that you have no idea and it will take another $308 to figure it out. It feels like I've been extorted and lied to.<//text><rating>1< /rating>< name>

<text>Jayleen and Deonte were absolutely amazing ! I’m so sorry if I spelled their names wrong. But this dynamic duo saved my day twice ! I came in very close to the end of business and they both helped me and provided recommendations on what to do if I had any troubles. They welcomed me to come back the next morning if needed. I had my car towed to this location and they coordinated my service swiftly while I was at work and had my car fixed within hours. I am still amazed. Thank you so much! Customer service at this location is most definitely five star. You will be seeing me again! Thank you so much for your excellent care.< /text>< Rate>

This is THE best auto repair shop in the city!  The owner, John, is a truly good guy - very sincere.  He's probably the most honest man I've ever met in the auto repair world.  I wouldn't think of taking my car any place else.< /review>

My car seems to be running fine after the service, but I don't plan on ever returning because of the customer service. I brought my car in at 9:00 a.m. on a Friday for an oil change and general check. They called me back at 1:00 p.m. to report a couple issues, which they said they could have fixed by the time they closed at 6:00 p.m. That sounded fine to me, because I had plans 13 miles away that night and was counting on my car. When I called back at 5:30 p.m., they said it would not be ready until the next day and they had no loaner cars to offer me. So I ended up having to take the train and an expensive Lyft that night. Don't make promises you can't keep, it's no way to run a business.< /Review>

I like this shop for their convenience to USC. They have a good selection of tires, and their prices are competitive. I will use this tire shop for anything tires and maybe oil changes if you have the time and $$ as oil changes can be pricey even for basic options. Anything beyond tires and oil you should go somewhere else, it can also be tricky to get out of here they are usually quite busy, and they do not have the space to accommodate complicated auto repair. To their credit, most places are super expensive to get oil changes nowadays, and this site can be convenient if you live in the area or running errands nearby.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I'm actually submitting this review for a friend because they have her number and she is afraid of harassment if she posts it under her own account:
My car broke down over the summer and ended up being towed to university tire. They were about to close, so as myself and my friends were from out of the area we had to find a place to stay the night. Right off the bat, the woman at the front desk told us (8 minutes after closing) that we needed to hurry up because she was usually home by that point. Our Lyft arrived and we left for the night. The next morning, I called at opening to check on my car and was told I would get an email detailing what needed to be fixed and how long it would take. When I received that email, I was told that my car would be ready to go at 2 p.m. My friends and I had had to check out of our hotel at noon, so in the meantime we were three young women with nowhere to go in L.A. I called at 2:30 after hearing nothing and was told they needed three more hours to complete the repair. I reminded them that we did not have a safe place to stay, and had to drive to school the next day. They were not at all sympathetic, and the time they had told me was very close to closing. I left a one star review on this page detailing their failure to communicate and their insistence that we were overreacting. Within 15 minutes of posting this review, I was called and told my car was ready. When we arrived at University Tire, Dina spent about twenty minutes yelling at me until I cried for posting a bad review. She said they had been too busy to update me, but were obviously not too busy to check their reviews. She continued berating me until I took down my review and changed the rating to four stars. 30 minutes after leaving University Tire, I had to pull over again due to the same issue. They refused to believe me, despite receiving pictures, and I had to be picked up by family in the area. This is the worst customer service experience I have ever had.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1522793586846, 'text': "Hi Summer,\nThank you for your review.

They have the best customer service around. JOHN The service manager is the best. They always tell you exactly what is expected rhey have your vehicle ready when they say it's ready. They are located down the street from USC on vermont ave. And 29th.st across from one of the best hardware stores in town. Let them service your vehicle you will be very satisfied.
Thanks Steve mumphrey<//Review>

<Text>My car was suffering from a suspension problem, and needed immediate help. I had it towed to them first thing Tuesday morning, and they checked it out while I was at work. They picked me up at the end of the day and went over the damages item by item with me.
In addition to the suspension and resulting tire damage, they highly recommended that I replace the serpentine belt (cracked with age) and engine valve cover (leaking). I had been to see a mechanic earlier in the month for issues related to both, and they didn't catch that.
What gets them 5 stars? They gave me a complementary car to get home to valley and to work the next day. A big deal for someone who isn't old enough to actually rent a car.
My car was fixed by the end of the next day at the estimate cost. Thanks, University Tire!<//Text>< Pictures>

Totally unprofessional and all they want is get your money into their pocket, if I can give 0 star, I will. I went there for oil change for my new bought second hand car and they couldn't finish the task and charge me fully(about 70$)... Their reason is the filter is block by the bottom of the car, after I check online, it turns out the filter should be changed from the top for my car, and everyone on Youtube can easily do it. I was totally shocked by their unprofessional skill, totally waste of money. One of the tall staff is so rude and still don't admit his mistake of unable to change the filter.
I then went to "Vermont auto center", they change my filter easily, I strongly suggest  "Vermont auto center" where the owner is honest and full of skill.< /review>

Great pricing on tires to replace on my minivan.  When my other commuter car broke down on the freeway I had it towed here, they did a great job to repair it and check all the usual maintenance items.  John, the manager, is always friendly and helpful.  Free wifi too when you are in the waiting room so you can bring your laptops, phones, etc.

Highly recommend.< /text>

I had the BEST experience ever dealing with University Tire and Auto.  Not only did Dena the Manager take care of me with such professionalism she eased my pain about any inconvenience by giving me a rental care. My stress was eliminated immediately since they had to keep my car for a couple of days, HUGE!
Once getting my quote then Diante the Sr. Mechanic stepped in to help me understand my repairs and costs which was great.  Not only explained but took his time to really show me concern, that really mattered to me.  Being a woman in a repair shop is always scary but I have to say they didn't take advantage of me and I left feeling confident that I was truly cared for.  In fact, I am making them my permanent mechanics as long as Dena and Diante are there!   You cant go wrong....:)< /text>

Helped find out what is wrong with our car and were very prompt and helpful. Repairs costs were reasonable and they took good care of us. I would take my car here if I lived in the area.</text>

I came in for an oil change and he asked if I wanted a full synthetic oil or regular when I asked what the difference was he said he wasn’t going to waste his time explaining oil weights to me. He said that I should have asked those questions at the Hyundai dealership.< /review></record>

I usually take my car into a dealership but was in desperate need of tires and an oil change.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the prices and customer service exceeded my expectations.  John was especially helpful and didn't try to upsell me anything and took his time explaning the warranty they offered.   I was in and out, no hassle, waiting room was clean with wifi.  I will definitely bring in my car again!</Review>

<Review>They lied about a fixable tire. Saying it can not be fixed because it’s not in the middle of the tire.(See picture) However the tire was fixable, I showed the picture to a certified dealer. University Tire charged me over $700 for the two tire(for two tires since it’s all-wheel drive). Don’t go to this place, they swindle!

See the 2nd picture, he pointed out that is where The tire got the puncture, and it’s right in the middle!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOS5qb4u3P4eq6AEfoTCMXmRgueCwlTHRLqSB4X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures></record>

<review>Took car in for speedometer check, charged for a scope fee, after going back to them the following Monday, for them to finish checking car, I sat for over an hour waiting (in total). Mechanic drove car somewhere, came back and parked car and I waited some more. Finally car was brought to pickup area, was told I would have to pay over $300 for new instrument cluster but it was very clear to me that they never touched the instrument cluster. Paid for what they said they did and left.</review><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I was impressed. I had the beef chimichanga, and the flavors were awesome. It was my first Mexican food outing in Eureka since I moved here 2 months ago. The waitress was friendly and professional. The food had the flavors of homemade awesome. I will definitely come back.<//Text>

Chicken salad was fresh and delicious. Giant tortillas made fresh on-site. Frijoles de la olla were cooked delicately with cilantro and onion and were just right. The dining room and restrooms were well maintained and very clean.<//Text>

Amazing food & Service! I ordered a lunch for 15 for our staff a few days in advance & it was hot, amazingly fresh & so so so tasty. Our staff had more than enough for lunch and dinner.  Payment was quick and easy, they even had someone help put all the food in my car. Thank you so much, we can't wait to have  your food again.<//text>

Belim and her family and crew are the best Mexican food cooks, with my favorite (two day meal) being the burrito rellano. My husband loves the layered enchiladas, and he also loves when I offer him dinner from there as he does all the cooking at home. Calling in a to-go dinner is perfect as we live 15 minutes away and the food is just done as I walk in. Highly recommend Pachanga!< /text>

Couldn't find anything to eat in the area so I stopped by here with my cousin that was visiting.
Been a while since I ate here, I've always enjoyed the food...
Boy o boy was I impressed, their burritos are all huge though it was hard to choose what to order on the menu so I went with something basic an I got the fajita burrito...
they also have a pretty decent selection of shots to choose from and import/domestic beer as well...< /Text>

Love them. Authentic with lots of homemade items, like the salsa's that are wonderful!  I never would have thought to stop here if I didn't mix something up and go by mistake, and what a great mistake it was. It's now my number one Mexican spot in Eureka, with lots of veggie/vegan options, great portions and prices. Super cool margarita options. Owner's are friendly and helpful.</text>

Great burritos and chimichangas. I tried their nachos for the first time the other night and some of the best nachos I have ever had.

Check it out!<//Review>

The waiter was really nice and friendly and funny so I was expecting my food to be pretty good. Cabbage is their favorite ingredient. They put it on everything! Even the salsa lol. Anyways our food came pretty fast but everything was sorta bland. My chile relleno was delicious but everything needed salt. 40$ we paid for 2 people. My advice share a drink. Maybe even a plate.</review>

Best Mexican in Humboldt hands down! Clean and often locally sourced ingredients. BEST jalapeno poppers I've ever had. Super staff! I can't say enough good things about Pachanga. We don't eat Mexican anywhere else!< /review>

The bus boy departed and our server was already setting the table as we arrived. Flawless execution of expedited table service. Waters were constantly refilled, chips replenished and check promptly given. FOOD WAS BETTER THAN THE SERVICE, IF THAT'S POSSIBLE!</text>< resp>

One of my favorite Mexican places here.  The service is almost always quick and the food is so delicious.  Try the Jalapeno Poppers they are amazing but sometimes can be very very spicy.< /text>

The food is unique and has authentic flavors. As a bonus, I deal with local Health inspectors, and they have suggested that Pachanga is one of the cleanest kitchens with the freshest meats and produce.< /text>

About my only complaint is waiter communication, but the food here is great. Some Guatemalan food also. Prices put most dishes at nearly 13 bucks after tax with no drink, so that sucks. If they'd make prices realistic I'd visit far more often.</Review>

Organic and made fresh daily. The Burrito Ranchero looked incredible but I got the chicken flautas instead. They were excellent! The best I've ever had, seriously, and I know good Mexican food. Presentation was beautiful and added to the meal. A MUST TRY restaurant!< /Text>

Very good Mexican food. We showed up about an hour before closing with a party of 13 people and they gave us excellent service. Very friendly staff and the food came out quick! The margaritas were just ok but the food was way better than expected. The cabbage in the salsa was definitely interesting. I had the chicken mole and enjoyed it.

If you're in Eureka and want Mexican food, eat here!</text>

I had a great Ranchero Enchilada. My Pachangarita was a little tart and certainly festive for a change . Sope was a bit dry but still flavourful. I like that they are friendly to vegan/vegetarian options.< /text>

Over the top for GREAT food & friendly service. You should try the Poppers. (Incredible). If you don't like the food at this place, then you don't like (REAL authentic Mexican food). The only good Mexican food in Eureka.</Text>

When I order something that should come with a fresh salsa cruda and doesnt will weigh heavily on wether, or not, I order that dish again.  I won't order fajitas there.  Fajitas without pico de gallo, is like caramel apples, without the caramel.  Three stars is an ok rating in my book.</Review>< Pics>

This is the best Mexican food my husband and I have had in Humboldt County. The service is was amazing. Everyone working seemed to be part of a family, they were so nice and prompt. And did I mention the food was the best. We had jalapeño poppers that were out of this world, carne asada plate that was killer (the flavor of the meat was the best), a burrito and flan for dessert, also great!! Highly recommend this place. They also had a Dia de los Muerte table that was beautiful.<//Review>

This is one of the very few restaurants open in Eureka after 9pm. The staff was friendly even though we showed up 15 minutes before closing time. We ordered to go instead of opting to dine in, but two parties (4+ each) came in 3-5 minutes after us and they seemed fine letting them dine in, so that may be something normal for them.

Meals are a bit on the pricier side of the scale and seem to average $15/meal. The good was delicious though, you're able to choose vegetables and meats for most of the entrees instead of each item having a fixed list of ingredients. My taco salad was piled high with vegetables and had a tasty base of rice, beans, and small chunks of potato.

TLDR; restaurant staff is totally cool with you showing up near closing time, food is a bit expensive but delicious, and it's open past 9.</text>

Food was decent
the bill was 29$ for 2 people and we thought it was a bit expensive for the amount of food on the plate. We even got the cheaper items on the menu (13$) ranging from 11.50 to 22.50 with an average of about 14$ per plate.<//text>

O.M.G.
So let's just admit it... A lot of restaurants in Humboldt disappoint. Pachangas does NOT. Everything my family or I have ever ordered has been high quality, flavorful, and generously-sized portions.
My personal favorite is the sampler (pro-tip: add mushrooms to the quesodilla) because you get a little bit of everything. The cheese sauce that comes with it is absolutely divine.
No matter how full the restaurant gets I have never waited long for my food. The chips and guacamole are ALWAYS fresh, which I am very picky about.
Anyways, I can't say enough good things about this place. Family feel, impecably clean, and reasonably priced. The best!< /Text>

<Time>1620596921108< /Time><rate>4< /rate><review>Pretty good food. Went there for Mothers Day. Not sure if the entire menu was available but we ordered off the much smaller menu they gave us. Each mother was given a rose which was a very nice touch. 5 star not given for small reasons. The Mother Trucker omelotte and potatoes needed a little more taste.....like maybe adding bell peppers to it. Ketchup handed out in packets.....we like it out of a bottle. Coffee came in a paper cup......we prefer a real ceramic mug. Definitely worth a visit. Black Bear Diner still number 1 around here.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1620598384721, 'text': 'Thank you so much, so glad you enjoyed!

I love T&A Cafe, their burgers are out of this world and the salad oh so fresh!! They have daily specials, home made soups and pies! It's only open seasonally so they close in November for the winter months<//Text>

This is a great place to eat.  The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed with plenty of TRUCK parking.  Prices are reasonable.  I would give here 5 stars but my only complaint is their opening hours on Mondays...10am?  And the rest of the week is 7:30am?  Overall a great place to eat.</review>

burgers... so great. Great ambiance & decor. There was fast and courteous service. Bring your appetite because portions are large. My apartment is far from here, so I can't visit often.</review>

When you first come in to the parking lot of the diner you're welcomed by the singing sheriff. He's a great guy. When you get inside there's a big menu with amazing food. The prices are reasonable. Staff is friendly.</Text>

<time>1556346496568< /time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Had to pick up a load down the street and stopped in because I saw all the reviews and it was convenient location because there is truck parking. Got the Bandit breakfast sandwich, came with country potatoes. Was hardly worth the price, similar to a grand slam sandwich from Dennys but twice the price and the potatoes were mushy, not even fried like they're supposed to be. Don't waste ur time, only good thing is the convenience factor for truckers.< /text>< user>

<text>Truck Stop Cafe located inside large T&A Produce Company location in Spreckels, Ca. Plenty of food. Breakfast today was disappointing. The food has always been good in the past but I haven't been there in quite awhile. Owners, Don & Cherl Ferch, are usually hands on & Don is a Cordon Bleu chef. They weren't there today.< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< rate>

Hubby is a truck driver so everytime we're in the area we come here! The food is always soooo good and the bathrooms are always clean (if you live a trucker life you know what I mean) lol....My 3 year old ordered a pancake and he was given one in the shape of Mickey mouse which he loved :)< /review>

Stopped in for business lunch. Surprised with complimentary flatbread from manager after waitress asked if it was first visit. Generous sized ginger salmon fillet, well prepared. Waitress was super.<//Text>

I ordered the bacon & blu burger and garlic fries this time and was not disappointed. The burger is cooked to order and all the produce is the freshest to be found. The service is good and the facility is clean. I would recommend this joint to anyone who craves a good burger.<//review>

Its okay, when your hungry. Its a little pricey for whats being served. Its better than the food in my truck....Barely!! Carne Asada fries are at best below average. They need real cooks in this place!<//Review>

<text>Food is ok. Overpriced in my opinion.  Fries shouldn't be $1.50 extra with the sandwich.  Who wants to pay over $10 for fries and a plain old burger. Need more variety such as chopped steak, or spaghetti.  Even hot turkey or roast beef sandwich would do the trick.  The breakfast is not too bad. Pancakes are overpriced.  Dennys has better priced and tasty pancakes< /text></record>

<text>When this place was in Terminal 2, it was much swankier. Now it’s a bit more cramped and lacking showers and space to spread out but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. Some of the nicest people work here and make you feel welcomed and invited. They keep the drinks and munchies stocked. No, they’re not serving sandwiches — not a single Maple Leaf I’ve been to does that. However, they have some nice soups, hummus, salsa, tahini/yogurt, two different salads, edamame and cookies. Thanks to Maria and Alexis for making travel that much easier!<//text><Name>Eric Mayfield</Name><GmapID>0x80c2b0d7fd9d0357:0x80a7fabad23c773f< /GmapID><Date>1557799079848<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Clean.  Bright. SMALL. And VERY slow elevator. Definitely needs more seating. Quiet relaxing space.  Decent snacks and beverages.</Text>

<Text>Small lounge, there’s not enough seating and it’s cramped.. sitting areas so close to one another that you hear all the neighbors conversations. Food selection limited, and ran out 2.5 hours before lounge closed. Only apples available as fruit option. Departure screen at back hidden behind some decorative wall, so you have to get up and walk all the way across the lounge to see info. I literally scraped the dish to get the stuff that’s in my picture.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPmhkPVh2vZfg4pgqFVEanAh4MRE94QVtJO8YU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<text>The receptionist is not kind enough to help me verify my status even though I show a valid star alliance gold , ask to go out and only able to go in after calling copa airline customer service and they have direct contact with the receptionist. The food is not as expected, maybe because it is early in the morning around 6:00am. Ambiance is decent but a little small.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
The old MLL in Terminal 2 was much roomier and spacious.  This one is small and cramped.  The elevator up to the lounge level is very slow and is often crowded.  The lounge is still a good place to relax, grab a quick bite, a beverage and get some work done in a quiet place.  It can be crowded at times but the majority of my flights out of Terminal 6 is at 6:20am for the LAX to YVR flight so there are few of us in the lounge at that time.<//Review>

After 2 hours in LAX customs for what was meant to be a simple stopover, we wound up missing our AA flight to Toronto. Qantas kindly booked the next available flight through Air Canada. Wonderful service with wonderful staff. Meals and entertainment were simple but for a last minute 'hook up', we were grateful for tbe connection.<//Text>

<review>It needs more hot food with meat/ fish dishes for afternoons and evenings. Lunch is mainly vegetarian pizza slices and some pasta salad, and soup. Otherwise always great to get away from the hustle and bustle of the airport terminals.</review><Name>Darryl Eason<//Name>< userid>

Listed online as open from 5am and onsite as 430am. And yet there is a whole queue of tired business class passengers queueing outside a closed maple lounge door at lax at 545 am. Are service standards so low that even premium service hours are subject to an employee's waking timing?? Appalling< /Review>

Arrived at the lounge at 8am and it was not very busy.  The pros are there are many coffee choices, some juices, and limited fruit.  What I qas mot impressed with the choices of food, there was not much to tie you over.  There were limited newspapers and magazines, so after an hour we had to leave to grab food for our connecting flight.  The Air Canada lounge at YYZ offers a lot more options, food and drinks wise and many magazines to pass the time.  This was a stark contrast and not a lot of consistency.  Would have loved to stay longer, cleaner bathrooms and relatively peaceful.  The staff were very good at LAX lounge.  Always coming around to offer to take things away, they were very pleasant.<//Review>

<review>Nice setup.  Bit smaller than some of their other lounges.  Usual fare - salads, soup, nachos, cookies.  Free beer and liquor (as opposed to United LAX club where only some alcohol free).< /review>< user_name>

The food selection is pretty minimal. Really off putting when the front desk does not acknowledge you... pretty sad customer service skills. The ladies working in the food area were fantastic and the reason for the 2 stars. Not keen to fly air canada out of LAX again.< /text>

REALLY great food! We had fun sampling beers we would normally never buy, but the wait to get somebody to acknowledge our need for a box was sad. The even longer wait to receive the check was even worse. They removed our plates. They removed the beer samples. My husband left the table to have his after dinner cigarette and then waited in the car before our server FINALLY brought the check. Then the wait for him to pick it up was excruciating. My husband finally had to come back to find out if anything was wrong. In the time it's taken us to be checked out, my review has gone from 5 stars to 3 stars, and I'm still waiting.</Text>

One of the best fried chicken sandwiches out there.  If you dare, try their reaper wings.  Very tasty while being extremely hot.  They are the smaller sizes wings so you can order more than 6 if you can handle it.

The beer is also great with a very nice variety.  We did a flight of 6 with 4 oz pours.</text>

Staff is extremely friendly and the food is absolutely amazing! If you ever go, I highly recommend the elote nachos and tacos. Beers are not bad. There's bound to be at least one you'll love. Went to Lagunitas the other day and I would, hands down, prefer this place. LOVE IT.< /Review>

<review>Amazing! Used to frequent this place often before moving to Idaho. Made the 10 hour drive to come back for the Federation Giant release and some amazing food. By far my favorite beer in all the land. Cannot wait until I can have this beer delivered to Idaho!</review>< user>

Our favorite so far is the Passion Fruit Macaron sour. It was the perfect fruity sour blend. My fiancé loved the Stardusk Juicy IPA. Staff were super knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. They had a good amount of comfy outdoor seating and large menu which we will have to try next time. We can't wait to try the rest of our haul</review>

<Text>Everything about the experience worked and was what we were looking for. Great atmosphere outside despite Covid and the   cold. They had some heaters outside, which was great. The food was incredible. Patty melt with the deluxe black garlic fries. And the fried Alaskan cod tacos with arugula order. & a beer each, of course. Yum. Service was fast and team worked together to get everything done. Thanks! We will be back for the same prder.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We showed up about 2 right after the lunch rush. The food was different and good. Nachos are good for the Spicy crowd. The pretzel bites were tasty too. Beers were good and service was great. We’ll definitely be coming back!</Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>The food is pretty quality. Tasty and quick so thats a plus. Service is friendly as well. The beer is good. Last visit they were out of mutiple regular beers which was a bummer but overall they do a good job and its a good set up. Great spot to grab lunch and a pint.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwSQhqY8M-FKWiEwsm68fKoeDVedd0GBGGaA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFBLUmdksk5LKqEu5ORtfzruIPRJOBRCYdrA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>A great place to come and hang out and enjoy beers. They always have awesome beer and food pairings. A few months ago it was beer and macaron pairing... very interesting and delicious.   Their beer selection is varied enough to something for everyone. The food is always delicious and changes with the season. I highly recommend the fish tacos. Staff is friendly and attentive. There has always been plenty of parking any time I've gone. The art featured on the walls is really cool. Definitely come for a good time and great atmosphere.<//Text>< UserId.>

<Date>1582165443504< /Date><review>Great place for a brew.  They have an excellent food menu, awesome appetizers, great pairings that rotate, like beers and marcons, beers and bacon items, etc.  But the beer is the main event and is great without any foods, beers rotate often, and vary widely, so there is something for everyone<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Solid beer choices at this brewery :)  I like lighter beers typically and they had 6 or so Blonde/Wheat/Amber options and they were all very good.  The interior is well appointed with several options for seating, and they have a small outside section with tables and benches as well.
The food was pretty good, we got a charcuterie board, and some pretzel bites.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.

Definitely worth a stop.< /Review>< UserId.>

<text>This hidden gem keeps cranking out original ideas and original craft beer on such a regular basis that you'll always leave pleasantly surprised.  From friendly bar staff to monthly pairings (such as this months Slider & Beer Pairing, the blackened alligator being my favorite) to trivia nights hosted by the charismatic Kyle, you will fall in love with this constantly evolving brewery.  Great beer, great good, good service.</text>< Resp>

<Text>A great go-to place.  Good selection of tasty beers, has happy hour and great snacks (butter drenched pretzel bites are very decadent but go with a crisp cold one), and I always find a seat.  In warmer months it is dog friendly outside.  Staff is always friendly inside or out.  When the line at Russian River pisses you off, come here.  Or just visit anyway... Spread the beer love.<//Text>< Response>

<rating>5</rating><Text>They serve great food and their own excellent brews. I prefer IPAs and their Del Norte is my favorite. The entire staff is super friendly and always helpful. Order anything on the menu and you'll get three things: prompt service, a generous portion, and delicious food! I've enjoyed lots of great things (most of which I've had multiple times) street tacos, sliders, garlic fries, but I first ate here because a friend told me they have great burgers. He was 100% right!
Great place to go solo or with whatever size posse you choose.
Mr Universe behind the bar is Kyle and the good news is, he's as nice as he is jacked, lol! Introduce yourself and tell him Big Mike sent you!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Small but friendly brewery pub in Santa Rosa. I was on a work day so no beer review. The lamb sliders were fantastic! A great little side salad nicely done with olives and blue cheese crumbles...very tasty and not a nap time burger when finished. Washed it down with a really good bottle of root beer. Dog friendly and easy goin...yep...next visit an actual brew or two! Audi the bartender/server is a delight. Cheers!<//Text>< UserId.>

<UserId.>102254803433746077307<//UserId.><Review>Some hits and misses. Atlas (Blonde Ale) although having a bready malt presence in the finish was too hop forward/bitter for the style. Adjuncts in Painkiller work in harmony but nutmeg is prominent and distracting. Wishbone is spot on for style with glowing golden haze and intense hop aromatics and flavor bit restrained bitterness. Helios is like a Red IPA. Ferm character is clean but is a touch syrupy and sweet in finish. Del Norte is a brilliant example of the style. Best beer of flight. Godwood finishes with harsh alcohol burning in the throat. At 10+ % it is high for the style and it shows. Didn't even finish the taster.<//Review>< Pictures>

It's a great local brewery. I like most of their beers. My only drawback about their place on Cleveland is that it's one of the noisier places to try to sit with your friends and family and talk. The staff is friendly and easy going. Excepting the noise level it has the air of a comfortable place.</review>

<text>Some really good beer from this brewery.  Not sure if it was a daily special or something they sell all the time but the bacon pairing had not only good beer but some fantastic bacon samples as well. The peppered pork belly is unbelievable.

5 star beer, 5 star food, 5 star service! We've been here a few times now and each time has been perfect! The burger is amazing. The Ban Mi wrap is delicious. If you upgrade any meal to include pulled pork smokehouse fries you can split with a friend/love and both be full. The Hazy, Red, and Wit are the best beers, but they have new brews each time and the Belgian Double was worth trying too. Dog friendly patio with leash tie spots and spent grain dog treats. Happy hour deals are a buck off pints and select food deals.< /text>

Excellent food! Everything was tasty and the beers were good. The wings were not the fried type, and the order of one will do just fine for one person. (12 will get you leftovers!). I'll most likely go back on my way through town again!< /text>

Visited on Sunday, hungry for brunch.  Enjoyed the 3 beers at the bar waiting for my order.  The food served all around me looked good.  Didn't want to be impatient as they were busy so I waited a half an hour before I asked the bar tender how my corned beef hash was coming.  That's when I found out he forgot to place my order.  Had a nice dinner at Third St. Ale on my way home.</Text>

I have been coming here for years. Revisiting the review. Just came for beer today. Still have to say this is some of my favorite beer in the county. I would rather drink a Screaming Giant (the house double IPA) than most any beer I can think of. The staff are really friendly. The atmosphere is laid back and welcoming. I love this Brew pub. The menu is still somewhat limited, but there are some excellent options available. Bumping it up to 5 stars.

Really delicious beer, friendly service, pretty darn good food.

Not the most elaborate menu, but tasty. The butchers platter has some really good choices, though I  miss the smoked tri tip.

Good selection of beers and they have wine available so my wife (serious non beer drinker) can come and have a nice time. They have games available including a set of dominoes. Nice way to while away a few hours on a Sunday afternoon.

Clientele a lot less annoying than at certain other overly trendy brew pubs.</review>

<text>Brew is reasonably priced. They do have sours and saisons if you're into that kind of thing. Happy hour Monday thru Friday 3-6 pm!<//text>< user_name>

Good beer selection with a cozy, friendly atmosphere. Outdoor seating gives options. The food is good (especially the maple deviled eggs), but somewhat limited, even for pub food.</text>

<text>Walk in and you are immediately facing the bar where you order you food and drink.  Just like any bar, if it is crowded, expect to spend a few minutes trying to get their attention. Take a moment to watch them as they brew the beer. Pretty cool.</text>< pictures>

Really fun new brewery! They have a sampler and food (which is not cheap) and lots of places to sit inside and outside. It's also in a little shopping center with a couple wineries, so you can make a day of it (just don't drive home after all 3!)<//Review>

Restaurant week menu was delicious and presented well so good job to kitchen staff. But, ordering at the bar was seriously awkward and not customer friendly. Our friends waited at bar for over 10 min to order a drink and we're completely ignored then one of the bartenders snapped at them when they were trying to get their attention. So they left. You need more staff and you need to remind the bartenders that their job is about customer service. The employee that was bringing out the food was great but I wish he could've had some help because he was all on his own. Overall,  good food but service needs a lot of work.<//Review>

<review>Visited this place as my wife and I often do. Showed up and discovered they had live music Outdoors sounded awesome was really excited to see that. As the music was Outdoors most of the patrons were as well went in and sat at the bar and there was a few people inside took about 10 to 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there finally asked for menus and we were given menus only to be told 10 minutes later with the kitchen had already closed so I asked why we were given menus and we're told oh we thought you wanted to see the beer selection  uh? as if it weren't clearly posted on the back wall in large print. Considering the many places to choose from to have great beer in Sonoma County below-average service is unacceptable and will not be tolerated this place needs to get it together I don't know who the manager is but I suggest a quick review of their staff's attentiveness to the customer is in order. I really have enjoyed visiting this place and will not stop due to one bad experience will see if there is been any Improvement on my next visit before this place gets chopped!
I would like to add that this place is a third choice (in Santa Rosa) and I visit only when the other two are overcrowded so below average service is not really an option for them.

I rate this place Four stars for the beer and atmosphere Two stars for the service and attentiveness of the staff.</review>< pictures>

They pronounced it "del nortay" instead of del nort (if you know anyone from the emerald triangle, that's the way you say it). Good beer and food, worth a stop.</Text>

When I first visited, the staff was able to fit us in a table and make sure we were able to get some food before they closed.  Such great service and a fantastic meal I had to go back the next day and made sure to take some beer home! Definitely a spot I will continue to visit!< /Review>< Pictures>

The epidemic is related to outdoor dining areas. I arrived around 1pm on Saturday. There are still vacant seats, but most of them are occupied. During the meal, people will come to eat and drink.
The food part is quite delicious, among which the chili sauce prepared by the store is very flavorful and it goes well with all kinds of food!
Of course, the beer is very fresh, which is the most important thing, and the taste is rich, you can taste the beer! Passing nearby is quite recommended!

疫情關係所以都是戶外用餐區域，我大概是週六下午一點左右到，空位都還是有不過大部分都有坐人，用餐當中陸陸續續也是都有人來用餐喝酒算。
餐食部分都還算好吃，其中店家自調的辣醬很夠味，跟各種食物都蠻配的！
啤酒當然是很新鮮這是最重要，再來口感豐富，都可以嚐出啤酒香！有經過附近是蠻推薦的！<//Text><Rating>4<//Rating>< pics>

I don’t know where to start. I found them on accident because I was desperate for a good juice for my vape. As soon as I come in I’m greeted respectfully and the person behind the counter went straight to showing his selection (they have an endless selection so be prepared !). I ended up buying the Nord 4 that night, really amazing price! The next day I came to buy some juice, keep in mind I am very picky and indecisive with my flavors. The person behind the counter had so much patience with me and even let me try each juice I looked at and gave me some recommendations. I finally chose the one I liked the most and he was more than respectful through the process. If anyone is looking for TOP NOTCH QUALITY devices, glass, gear or juice, HEAD OVER THERE IMMEDIATLY! You won’t regret your decision, and as soon as you come in, you’re a part of the family! Thank you guys for the pleasant experience, this is my new go to shop and I’m not saying that lightly.< /text>

Bought a Puffco plus today and it came with a bad battery, I went back in they swapped the faulty battery no hassle and apologized for my inconvenience. Thanks again Marwan! I hope your boss knows his employees do an excellent job for him as I will be a returning customer for many more years to come.</review>< pics>

<Review>Love this place! For all your smoking needs, vapes, juices, hookahs, CBD products, cigarettes, specialty cigars and so much more and the staff is all very friendly and very knowledgeable on it all! And the shop is set up so well and the renovations in their new shop on panama is like night and day from the smoke shop that used to be there. Definitely recommend this place as the go to smoke shop!!< /Review>< userid>

Disappointed.  Was looking forward to great food on our way home from Avila. QR menu ordering was convenient,  but promotes lack of service.  Asked for water 3 times, didn't receive it until after we received our food. Food came out fairly quickly,  but medium rare burger was Rare, hence the quickness. Burger was bland, needed charbroiling, smoking,  something. A bit of Montreal seasoning would've gone a long way.  Chicken Tinga tacos were OK, nothing special,  and over-priced.<//Review>

We went to Firestone on May 15th 2021. They have redone the patio area in the front. Lots of open area seating covered with a partially shaded pergola. It's a really nice area now outside to enjoy the valley weather. This location has switched over to the "ontap" ordering system. We really liked this system. You essentially use your phone to place orders for food, drinks, etc. This is nice because you can queue up your drinks instead of having to wait for the waitress/waiter to come by and check in on you.

The staff was friendly, quick to bring out the drinks and the food was delicious. The crispy chicken sandwich is my favorite. Sweet with a little kick! Goes great with the Double Mind Haze IPA!

This was a great spot and we are so glad we picked this location for the weekend to enjoy getting out of the house. If you enjoy great craft beer and wine, you won't be disappointed! Highly recommended.<//text>

<review>Top notch service!! We were treated like we owned the place the minute we walked in and thanks to the staff for being so accommodating 😀 beer selection is perfect, outside dining options are wonderful. We sat next to the fireplace outside and enjoyed that area all evening while dining and tasting all the beer options. We the Bear Burger, wings, fries, chicken caesar salad, fisoh tacos and all cooked perfectly👍👍👍👍< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9AptSJUiLGJDLiyE0YSiN6OiKjawgNY-ICAf3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgdF_m45-7jIQW1u1QG5wrhhxcIzmrCdwTa5l1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNPYZEgPjS3n-Nedj2AS5L8bHVUW9hkeoHvYUl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlPObW7lgJY0dMpO1Zy5tdJEtIV_Px3x0Z8f4c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9onprpTqZvJf1E6-KSCIYToH6Lg0HfzL7Am2r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCMD26VQY8KO4eiTDzm5DPzEr1U2ECokSeCnZ6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjWQLwa0oWYsLpMvDPqCoxCXuum2PlqCzcw-SG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8JoIzHFsYla6JbqxsA6lfJSMtzEeb3PLz_NT7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJT3I9Cz6OEFE8uMFnhzb1t5egGI0W-TZyu2l2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb3LN4Lu2E9ACxrPXlvlqTwltr-SK6mXP01vz1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO20EXHP4bRntPHWBHiWQgFIukXVBXLIU0gE-HG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoDDhYMu46zbaCMibQCWRTl72AtLwS_YTGkaqc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8fIfStOBoeBJ-If1ZX0cTDKtxQPd5gPR2WYDl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_WJV4T1psf7wZLEdCNzYkk5T6t1IhNsBl7c92=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Time>

Food was fantastic, I think however it was just a little over priced. We had the wings 7 for 14.00 bucks, fish n chips 4 fish sticks for 19.00 and a double burger for 17.00. These were lunch prices, sound more reasonable for dinner prices. Like I said it was all good but not somthing we can afford on a regular basis. They need like a happy hour or something. Would like to go back for wings and beer but need a special of some sort.< /review>

<Review>I was staying at the hotel next door and took a stroll over. Nice environment but food options are a little limited whixh I guess makes sense its a brewery.

If your in a wheelchair as I am, be very aware that you may not get in or out of this place. They have to handicap parking spaces however the ramp to get on the side walk sits in front of a parking spot a couple spaces down. So if a car is parked there you will ne blocked. I got in but had to hop the curb into another spot to get out. I have no idea how this places passed i spection for ADA compliance.< /Review><username>Anthony Roadman< /username>< pics>

Love 805 brews and this place has super yummy food too!  Not thrilled with the new way of ordering but can't blame the restaurant for that... they're making it work in these weird times.  Be sure to check their hours on the day of your visit though, they close early!</review>

<Review>Understaffed.  No variety in menu selection. You have to scan the code for menu. I was with my 91 year old mother and 75 year old aunt. Both own flip phones, so that was an epic fail. They had no wait staff so you either order on line or at the bar. Hostess was very pleasant.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I must admit, that like many other restaurants we are short staffed right now, but are actively looking for new employees. We also do understand the mobile ordering process is not for everyone, and hope that with time we can bring back some full service dining areas when staffing allows. We do hope that you will give us another shot in the future. Thanks - Scott P.'}<//Response>

Incredible. Well worth the 45min drive from down town Santa Barbara. Awesome aging room (so it appears)that you can walk in with all kinds of wooden barrels. Huge to small, a few clay containers and regular sized barrels. Quite a sight. Nice little gift shop and all kinds of hard to find beers. Had some great aged and regular flavored beers. The food was very good. Chefs special burger. No complaints. Great atmosphere. Very creative seating in the restaurant section. Go sip your beer in the gift shop. Best view of the old barrels.< /Review>

<text>Great food and excellent selection of beer. Ahi tacos, Fish and chips are amazing. Bring a jacket if you plan to visit for a dinner. It's windy most of the time and there are no heaters on the patio. Once you get seated don't wait for a waiter to take your order. You need to place an order yourself by going inside the brewery.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUAqqqAe7wKRQZzsl7xqrN3iuN0M9sP4hwjkCv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLtuohhaFvilmxRiPzqFU1tWyLqEMm_cZk04b6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZMZsodKe5K6LbLU3HYjx0mPRqpFpZ2ct3Xiom=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUTZXAFxgE0Kp6CbM_VqocL99lNyoRKV_2_y6N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvuFcXJISPtsKsrEqTYm45Ie7aPCjj22eBB4ZD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80eeaba39ac328b9:0xecba7aa0c4f95cc2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Always fantastic. Tried their mudslide which was a strong ale with flavours of chocolate, caramel and maybe vanilla? We also tried Cow Bell, Big Mood and Britta Weisse, all very good. I wish the Blue Love wasn't sould out but if it's good it's gone!</Text>

The food was way better than I hoped for.  The crispy Brussel sprouts truly were!  Deep fried, seasoned, and then briefly roasted, they were the best I've ever had.  On the edge of the Santa Rita Hills AVA, they actually had local wines.  Amazing for a brew-based place to have anything but unknown cheapo plonk.< /review>

<Text>This is a beautiful location, lots of wood and open space.  The separate barrel room bar was really cool as well.

The food was solid, and the beer selection was a pretty standard variety for Firestone.  Totally worth a stop.<//Text>< gmapID>

Great brewery environment and appreciate the eat on patio only rules. Easy to order as well using the QR code on the table.
Couple things that disappointed me:
1. The Brussel sprouts were seriously lacking in quantity (picture was after I had literally eaten just 2 pieces). For $8+ I expected more.
2. My wife is gluten allergic and specifically asked for her burger without buns thru their fancy online QR code ordering method but ended having to take the bun off herself. It's okay for her as she is only mildly allergic to wheat. But if you're more gluten allergic, I recommend ordering in person.

Other than those issues. Food was great (my spicy chicken sandwich was really good).<//Review>

Delicious beer and delicious food. Pretty expensive though, at least in my opinion.<//Review>

Service was pretty bad - we walked in and stood at the front counter for 10 minutes before we had to walk in to find someone to recognize us. Then service throughout was just delivering us food. Then they added 20% tip by default and we couldn't change it.

Food was mediocre - wings seemed like they were sitting for 10 minutes. Ahi wonton tacos were ok. Sent brussel sprouts back because they were cold and soggy. Came back hot with no seasoning or anything.

Beer was good - only reason this isn't 1 star

It almost seemed like they know people know who they are, and the beer is pretty good, so they don't need to care that we are there. Very disappointed.<//text>

WOW!! Awesome place for craft brews. The food is also great! Make sure to get the rotation tots, as they constantly are updated with new specialty versions. I had the special burger that was great so many flavors and a huge meat patty. Must have been a 1/2 lb at least!<//review>

If you can't make it to the primary location, come here.

Upon walking in I was greeted immediately. My party consisted of 7 people in total.

We chose the table next to the door. The restaurant was amazingly clean and the service was immediate.

First I will talk about the food and what we ordered. Then I'll speak about the brew. What we ordered is as follows. Calamari, French onion soup, fish tacos, taproom burger, basil chicken sandwich and last but not least the pretzel.

The calamari.
Not your traditional calamari. Asian infused with a honey glazed slaw. Is it bad by any means? No. It was tasty, but sweet. So be prepared for that.

French onion soup.
Just like my other review stands for their primary location. By far the best French onion soup I've ever had in California. Maybe even the states in general. That's saying A LOT! It's fresh. Perfectly caramelized onions, bread and broth soaked. With perfectly melted cheese. I HIGHLY recommend it!

Fish tacos.
Not your average fish tacos. But I have to be honest I didn't quite get to try them as much as I should. Because the table eat them so fast!

Taproom burger.
Not a frozen patty of any kind!
Loose meat patty seasoned perfectly. Asked to be cooked medium well.
It was absolutely perfect.
Raw onion, lettuce, tomato, avocado, bacon and I picked cheddar cheese.
The way a burger should be anywhere you go. THIS is a burger just like you'd take your time to make at home. To perfection.
HIGHLY recommend it.

Basil chicken sandwich.
Again I didn't get to try it as much as I'd like. It was eaten far to quickly. Which is a GOOD sign. My whole table was very picky eaters and everyone was satisfied.

Moving onto the brews.

I keep it simple usually with the Union Jack IPA.
But I did get a chance to try some sours.
Primarily "krieky bones"
I don't like sours much.  But this one is a must try.
As for the Union Jack? I'm sure many have written about that beer particularly all over online. As it's one of their most known beers ever made.

The atmosphere here on a early Sunday ( 11:45am ) was great.
Staff was amazing as was the cleanliness and presentation of the entire establishment.

With that said. I would highly recommend coming here. You won't be disappointed.

Food: Above
Decor: updates. No issues.
Staff/customer service: Excellent service. No complaints!
Cleanliness: Clean, no issues.
Bathroom: Clean. But only has air dryer for hands no towels.<//text>

Very, very simple food menu. Service is underwhelming.  You go inside to place your order,  they bring it to you.  Patio is like an oven. No fans or water sprayers, while the temperature was around 104'F.  The beer is great.  Funny thing -- my hotel has the same beer (on tap) , better foor options and I can eat in the comfort of a cooled room!<//review>

<Text>Successful round of tasters (for 2).  Tried the Buellton location this time. (Huge fan of the original in Paso Robles). Great pretzel for appetizer. Loved the mustard dip, and I'm not a fan of mustard!  The burger and salmon dinners were delicious. Ambiance is great.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdVsVMQtcZmbrJEKWHI1eXiuahy3TMLLSjx735=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK5Wr9Trv-6k9ZcIS6KvCnjDBhaWgMQSfvS5X0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGmcYcevSlkDwGwZH_uLDLwfV6l2Dbv5Vv3ZpF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD_GHcZGbhWsq8Dqxgo1p-uS0z8GnJ-2SAiZbF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80eeaba39ac328b9:0xecba7aa0c4f95cc2</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The Rotating Tots were amazing. We had some crazy version called falafel. The hot Wings are amazing too. Snuck in the back door, called the ‘tap room’ and surprise! Really nice staff and decent service. Highly recommend. Enjoy!</Text>

<Review>My boyfriend surprised me for my birthday with a trip to Solvang and we ended up checking this place out. Everything was insanely delicious.

We ordered beer and wine, mac n cheese, and the short rib dinner.  After dinner they even brought me a sundae with a candle in it, just to make the night even better! I highly recommend this place. I wish it wasn't so far from home because I would love to go back.<//Review>< user>

Came here for snacks one night after drinking at another place in town. Food was good beer, was good as all are from FW. I’m sorry I can’t remember much as I was somewhat buzzed.  Hopefully the pics will help.<//Text>

Come here for the beer, skip lunch. The food was quite overpriced for what you get, unfortunately. They forgot the fried chicken on my $18 chopped salad, no big deal but when I finally got it it was pink. We really enjoyed our beers but next time I'll just go to the barrelworks instead.< /review>

Awesome establishment and vibe. The beer 🍺 types are plentiful and with Social Distancing being able to order from your smartphone is awesome!
Many yummy 😋 food choices, including great pretzels 🥨 and Beyond Beef options!

Highly recommend as an a break to wine 🍷 tasting!< /Text>

<review>It was a pilgrimage of sorts. I have always loved Firestone Walker beers and been a fan for years. I have always looked to visit their brewery for many years and I finally had a chance to do it yesterday. It was definitely worth the visit. Great beer was assumed but the food was delicious as well. The wait staff were courteous and very helpful. The visit to the taproom was definitely better than any of the wine stops we made in SY valley. I will be back for sure.< /review>< Pics>

A more casual and noisy ambiance then say the Stone Brewery (Costa Mesa).  Beer selection is top notch.  Service while not quick was very professional especially with dining companion's not common food allergy.  Extensive menu.</Review>

Unfortunately, we dined in during the pandemic but it was a great experience. Their menu was mostly burgers and pizza but the food was delicious and the service was great. I cant wait until they open up to get the full experience.< /Review>

<Review>Awesome establishment and vibe. The beer 🍺 types are plentiful and with Social Distancing being able to order from your smartphone is awesome!
Many yummy 😋 food choices, including great pretzels 🥨 and Beyond Beef options!

Highly recommend as an a break to wine 🍷 tasting!<//Review><rating>5< /rating><UserId.>115739961408510113520< /UserId.><gmap_id>0x80eeaba39ac328b9:0xecba7aa0c4f95cc2<//gmap_id>< Pics>

<Text>They do a great job with social distance-ing mask enforcement and friendly service.  They really were so friendly!
The food was delicious - I had the Ruben and husb had a burger - both were fantastic!  ( We sort of shared!)

They should have a better system. Is a big place though. Next time if they haven't improved on this, I'll put a flag on our table, the flag with the words PLEASE HELP US!.

Good food. Nice people. And the beer.  Lets not forget the beer; Its a barrell aged playground of mind blowing ideas and flavors. Really super fun for anyone, but a real treat if BBA or experimental brews are of interest to you. Check it out.<//Text>

Was in town for work and a bunch of us came here for dinner. We tried a bunch of appetizers, which were all very good. The pizzas particularly stood out! My main course was the beef short rib. The meat was tender but where's the bone?! You gotta leave the bone in... everyone knows that. Overall though, food was good and they have a load of beer opinion (obviously) for everyones taste, so your gauranteed to find something you like.< /text>

<Review>We visited from Philadelphia, and I wish we had a place like this near us. Every single beer on the taplist was delicious. All 18 we tried. Got to chat with one of the FW sales reps who was there for a drink, and some other people at the bar who gave us some great advice on places to visit in the area for the craft beer scene. Service was helpful and very knowledgeable.This place has amazing beer and incredible people. Can't wait to return one day!< /Review>< UserId.>

We were passing through from Los Angeles to Pismo Beach.  So we stopped for dinner.  We were seated very quickly, the waitress made some suggestions based on the kind of beer I liked (she was very well informed).  After choosing my beer she also made some quick suggestions on food pairing.

Over all the food was pretty good and so was the beer.  I'd definitely go again if I'm in the area just to try more of their beers.<//review>

<Review>Extremely knowledgeable server. Very interesting & varied tasting beers. My first experience with sour beer(usu. a stout or porter beer drinker, but really loved several of the sours. I advise going for 2 tastings, separating stouts from the sours, as they are very different beers that don't complement one another in the same tasting.</Review><user_id>103596279712558080597<//user_id>< GmapID>

Great beer, if you are not going to get any food make sure you go to the bar around the merchandise display. The bar at the back is way better than the one by the entrance as you avoid the restaurant traffic and the staff is very knowledgeable.<//review>

<Time>1569473580458< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><review>AKA "The Taproom"? First time customer so my honest first impression was a pleasant one. Great atmosphere, genuinely friendly service and an ingenious menu. I ordered the Ahi fish taco appetizer. Loved the concept and the Ahi was en point! I thought perhaps the Wonton taco shells could use some oompf! but then again, what do I know?  Oh and I'm a Guinness girl with an affinity for Belgian beers so Merlin's Milk Brew was right up my 'ale'y! Bad dad puns aside I'll definitely go back to try out the next menu innovation (then pick up an 805 tee on my way out).<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Love the strong ales, and the food is great! Short ribs and roasted Brussel sprouts are amazing!

Also I highly recommend checking out the barrel room - they have a section that they allow customers to look at, and you can chat with them about the production process.

They have several prior years anniversary ales in barrel works right now, including XIII (2009) surprisingly.</review>< pictures>

Great beers. There IPAs don't have that harsh flavor. Am not a fan of IPAs. But how they add those ingredients together make them taste great. You will at least like one of them if you try there 4oz flights. They range from 2 to 4 bucks.  Great services when we got there, are server was named Sheldon.

Dependable place to stop and eat--I love the pulled pork sandwich and always get a flight of their darker ales, porters and stouts.  They also sell limited run beers in a fridge in the tasting room.  Great spot for photo opps in the room where many barrels are stored that you have to walk through to get to the tasting room, if you like to post on social media.< /review>

Great destination for craft beer lovers and even the general public.  I've been here 3-4 times and each visit I'm amazed at how many barrel-aged wild ales and fortified stouts and blended strong ales they offer.  Barrelworks, by Firestone Walker, is the experimental version of their regular beer offerings and is next door to the regular brewery/brewpub.  Highly recommended if you enjoy bourbon-barrel aged Belgian quadruple ales, Russian Imperial Stouts and Wild Sour Ales.< /text>

They have a great selection of beers and you should try their barrel works, which is their limited unique brews. Besides their amazing beer, food is delicious!! We had their burgers and they didnt disappoint, juicy, culminating, and amazing ingredients.</review>

Food is great, atmosphere was great.
Our group of 8 arrived, we were seated quickly. It was very busy when we arrived, but died down quickly after. It took a really long time for our server to come to us for our drink order. Once we ordered our drinks and appetizers, it took 25 minutes to get two small appetizers, and an additional 45 minutes to get our food. It was an enjoyable time. If you have time to wait, then this is great. Great place to visit if you aren't in a hurry.<//Text>

<Review>Had a great time sampling the sours and double barrel ales in their "Barrel Works".  Drinks were great.  Barman was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Had a great bluecheese burger for lunch.  So glad I made the detour from Lompoc to check this place out.<//Review>< pics>

We had a great experience! Terrific selection of beers (& ciders). And good food to complement a good brew. We also had them fill my custom growler (I happened to have with me:). Nice staff and easy on/off the 101 Freeway. Looking forward to another visit.</review>

We always go there for my birthday and the food is delicious. Our waitress was fabulous the only complaint that I would have is the girls in the front two seat we're too busy having a conversation amongst themselves to even greet us and seat us then when my friend came in she said she waited in the front where the two girls run the conversation and decided to walk the restaurant herself to find this other than that it was a good experience< /Review>

<text>Always an incredible time. Beer is always on point. The staff are friendly and anticipate your needs. Its very fun to walk around between the Taproom restaurant and the Barrelworks.

<Text>I stopped in for a bite to eat.  I sat myself at the bar and for 10 minutes the wait staff passed by without saying a word, not a I'll be with you in a minute, not would you like a drink or a menu, nothing.  The wait staff was very chatty with the regular patrons, but unfamiliar faces get ignored.<//Text>< pictures>

Ok, busted! Here I am again at yet another brew house. Do I like beer - yes. Just any beer? Well, no. I’m not an IPA fan, and that’s mainly what they have here. They always have a selection that’s not quite so hoppy, and today it’s their Lager. A very well balanced beer. The food here is actually excellent. Pizza, excellent burgers, great sandwiches like their pulled pork, super appetizers, and more. Great service, great food, great beer. If you’re coming through Buelton or Solvang, make it a point to stop. You’ll be happy you did.< /text>

<Review>This is the best place for great beer in the area. They brew a variety of styles, including sours and barrel aged beers. They also have a barrel room inside the brew pub that specializes in their barrel aged beers and sours but you can get quite a few of them in the brewpub proper.

The kitchen is pretty good as well, with a bit of a seafood oriented tilt. It's relatively affordable when compared to the restaurants in Solvang but I would definitely not call it a bargain.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Great sours, good food, average service.  It is a big and busy restaurant.  Noise level is fairly high.  Don't miss the tour if you want to learn how sours are made.<//text>

This place is a nice little gem while driving through the middle of nowhere.  They serve some tasty appetizers and meals, and always have plenty of beers to choose from.
They actually have two different areas for different types of beers; the main brewery/ restaurant which serves the mainstream Firestone beers; and Barrelworks, which serves more of the craft and specialty beers.
This was my second time visiting Firestone Buelton, and I have to say I was impressed with the menu and service both times.<//Text>

I really enjoyed tasting all the unique ales and beers. Knowledgeable pourer made the experience great and helped me pick my selections. Later we switched to the dining room to eat and had great tater tots, pizza, pretzels, and other. Liked the options for beer tastings from small to full pints.</Review>

We have visited the Firestone Barrelworks quite a few times over the years on our way to Santa Barbara, but our last visit was lackluster at best. We must have had a server who either was brand new or who shouldn't be serving. He messed up almost all of our drink orders, bringing us incorrect beers. The food was so so and it was absolutely freezing in the place. Unfortunately, we probably won't be stopping here in the future.</Text>

Stoped here for a bite with some friends and this place was ok but definitely not great. Our server was nice but inattentive very slow and took for ever to serve us. The food took an hour to come out and I ended up getting the wrong dish. Food was ok, real small portions and ok quality but nothing great. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're in a rush to get food fast. For a first time being here it was ok but nothing to brag about. I probably wont come back anytime soon.<//review>

<Text>I really like their beer, and their tap house is definitely a fun place to eat dinner and have a couple beers. However, I'd say their food has perhaps gone backwards a bit. We've been coming here once or twice a year for a while, and each time a little less impressed with their food. It's still pretty good, but it's been better. I hope they renew their attention on the food. Everyone knows their great beer, and coming to their house to eat and drink should and could be top notch, yet it comes up a little short.</Text>< user>

<review>I've been here twice for dinner. First time my steak was over cooked, had to send it back. Second time my pasta was under cooked, super chewy. I try not to be picky, but this place isn't cheap and I would expect more... At least the beer is good.< /review>< rating>

You've got to come here. Great Atmosphere. Sort of an industrial California-English pub. The beer selection is great. The food was great. Standard pub fare, but done really well - with an unexpected twist.  The fish and chips are so light. Chicken nuggets all breast meet and spot on. The caramalized onions on the burgers a re perfect.

Glaze on the salmon. Wow.

Most importantly, you'll leave here happy.<//Review>

Some of the food was very good but some were mediocre quality. Pork tacos made one person sick. The spinach and Brussels sprouts salad was excellent. Just be careful what you order.< /review>

<Text>I believe its still under the Firestone Walker family so of course the beer is fantastic and the food is also very very good. Very nice restaurant is unexpectedly large for this town. Comes down to service and training.   Recommend to not sit in the large bar section anywhere past 830 pm even on a friday!  D grade service, and the chairs may be stacked up so bad around you its a challenge to get out.  Next visits will be better im sure and its still great choice in this area.<//Text><userid>110734021545195430485< /userid></record>

First time visitor, arrived at 10 minutes before closing on night prior to labor day. Was told to order before last call, so ordered milk stout to later see they had Java brews also.  Enquired about tasting coffee brews, but was told they were closed even though they were still pouring other brews??? Didn't make any sense.  Needless to say, not in a hurry to stop in again.</text>

Pretty pricey! I really love 805 beer and coming here was on my bucketlist. I felt let down after the service i had and also the high prices. My waiter knew nothing about the menu and prices. If she was new then i understand but when she would try to get help, no one would help.</review>

<Text>Great beer, awesome food and fantastic service. You can't beat that. We also hit the Barrelworks for some samples of interesting choices. None of which I enjoyed, but my coworker seemed to like a few of them. It was a fun adventure anyway.</Text><GmapID>0x80eeaba39ac328b9:0xecba7aa0c4f95cc2< /GmapID>< Pics>

<review>Smaller than the other Firestone properties but this review focuses around the Barrelworks portion.  At this location they have a room that focuses on  barrel aged ales and sours.   At almost any point they will have a bunch of offers for you to try and often will have selections that are one off or from a specific barrel.  This can be neat to try the same beer but from different barrels.  I have also never seen the place very busy. I hear it is busy on release days but the times I have been are non-release and never busy.</review>< Pictures>

Our server was nice but inattentive very slow and took for ever to serve us. The food took an hour to come out and I ended up getting the wrong dish. Food was ok, real small portions and ok quality but nothing great. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're in a rush to get food fast. For a first time being here it was ok but nothing to brag about. I probably wont come back anytime soon.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

805 on tap at Firestone tastes much better than on tap in bar elsewhere. The citrus notes come through better and it's not quite as bitter. The burgers are really really good. It's a perfect place for lunch on a long trip down the 101 between San Francisco and santa Barbara.< /text>

One of my top three favorite breweries! You MUST go to their Barrelworks tasting room if you want to sample their best beers! Strong ales and really good sour selections. The location is a bit out of the way, but the place is well worth the trip. Many top rated award winning beers to taste and take home. If you like craft beer you will love this brewery. They have two separate dining areas with different menus, and two separate tasting bars with different taps.</review>

< Review>
Very nice indeed 👍! My kind of style. From the exterior when you're parking and or walking up to open the entrance door for your special person or even for the very happy, fat, and I mean that in a good way, and forfilled patron and their party. It's a mix of both  rustic western and modern industrial architecture. Expect the same whenever you're inside with the obvious introduction of the well anticipated main attraction. The Ale! It's born right here inside this building. Take a deep breath and then relax. You know right away that you are not in the wrong place! I've seen all the beer flowing from the taps but that's not what overwhelms your senses,oh no, it's the food in the air. You know right then you're more hungry than you ever thought! Whether you're at the bar, in the lobby or sitting down in the dining room, either way, your experience is well worth any other choice you could have made in regards to where to go for a good place to eat , drink and enjoy your time with good people. Barrelworks, Firestone Brewery! Right here in our backyard in Buellton California. You won't regret this place for dinner. Put on your favorite boots and come hungry ! Before you go, don't be shy and purchase a few novelty items and or memorabilia to represent Firestone Brewery and remind yourself  where you have been.! Thank you and yes...there are food and beer Gods, JC.</Review>

<Text>Such a cool spot. The public areas are very well maintained. The gift shop is filled with plenty of cool merchandise. There available beer is amazing and the beertenders are extra helpful and very knowledgeable. Had the Krieky Merlin which was so good! The food was equally as good!

Even if you don't drink, you owe it to yourself to enjoy a meal at that surprising restaurant. We were a group of four, and we ordered 3 shareable starters, which was one too many, because when the main courses came, they were more than generous. The brisket of beef sandwich was delicious and the fries that came with it were crispy outside without being overcooked. One of us has a chicken salad, again, excellent. The Panko crumb breaded ahi tuna was a masterpiece. I never expected food to be this good in a brewery! It was early for drinking, or I would have tried the tasting flights they feature. We did have a glass of wine, and both were very good (at $9 they need to be good!).
Service: without exception, the service was great, whether in the tasting taproom or the restaurant. These folks are trained to be nice, but it seems to come natural to them. Kudos to the management of this place.

<rating>4</rating><Review>Barrelworks is on the right side of Firestone Brewery. They have mostly all sour beers which I don't care for and a few strong ales, as well. I got a saison, but it was still a little sour, so I went through the attached door to Firestone and got their Mind Haze which is their newest IPA which I really like. I didn't eat, but the Firestone side has the regular Firestone menu which has some nice bar food on it.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Firestone Walker is one of the nicer breweries I've been to. It's also one of the bigger craft beer companies out there. Did not expect it to be where it is located. It's like a huge brewery located out of nowhere.

The entire restaurant is super clean. Staff was extremely friendly as well. Food is a little pricy though but pretty good. It's a definitely a ice pit stop if you're on your way either up north or down south.< /review>< pictures>

<review>One of my favorite breweries so far. If you are a beer lover, you should definitely try the list of specials (don't come all the way to get a 605 you ll find on any store shelves). Strong barrel aged stout beers were great, and the Judas Yeast (high suspension brew) looked and tasted a bit like a piña colada...< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80eeaba39ac328b9:0xecba7aa0c4f95cc2<//Gmap_id></record>

Yes please. The bar in the front serves their regular fare, which is great but you're missing out if you don't go to the barrel works just to the side of the restaurant area. Here they serve their strong ales and sours. And to bot the restaurant is pretty darn good as well.< /Text>

<Text>A must pit stop when driving through on the 101. I always stop here for lunch and sometimes dinner several times a year. Service, brews, and food are top notch compared to many brew pubs. Their food is a cut above the typical brew pub fare I've had before and sure beats a roach coach any day. The dinner menu is actually bona fide compared to any good restaurant...not simply pub fare.

The gem of the experience is the back room for specialty batch tasting and gift shop.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80eeaba39ac328b9:0xecba7aa0c4f95cc2</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Food is decent.  Slightly expensive.  Beer is good,  try the unfiltered dba for a beer unique to the tap room.  Be aware that they regularly have no idea how to pour a beer,  but they use imperial pints so I don't complain.< /text>

If you love Firestone Walker brews (like I do) and you're in Santa Barbara County, then travel to Buellton (off Hwy 154) to tru this little gem. They make their wild ales here now, but the tasting room and restaurant are all Firestone Walker. The food (fish tacos for me, chopped salad for ther missus) were both delicious and well done. But it's the beers we came for, and they did NOT disappoint.
My wife sampled two stouts (both I'd had before) and loved them. I sampled five others, including a sour, a wild ale, a stout and two to-be-released IPAs inspired by "Game of Thrones". The Red IPA we bought as a crowler, but the Black was just as good.
Great service, helpful, knowledgeable staff who all enjoy working there: what's not to love?< /review>

I waited to seated at the podium. No one came. We seated ourselves at the bar. No one eay hello or any thing until i requested to see a menu. Slow service. Food is too expensive for the quality. Our food took so long to get to us and by the time it did melted cheese was so hard. Beers are ok not that great. Chef could do better to pair food to beers. I got the naked tri tip sandwich let me tell you. Please go back to culinary school. Or look up da smoked house in oxnard, they are doing it right and sandwich is only 11 dollars. Please hire more people to take care of your business. Need more servers to run food faster and to keep up with service. Even the waitress was complaining that she was the only one on that side of the floor<//Text>

I rated the a three because the bartender was nice.  But the food was not so good.  I ordered the fish and chips.  The fish breading was turned and extremely greasy.   I could not eat the breading at all.  Had to pick the fish out of it. Was not too happy but I chose not to say anything because it was not the bartender's fault.< /review>

Great place for a wide variety of craft beers and the food is fantastic! The menu should have something for everybody. Prices are reasonable. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable. Their Panko- crusted ahi is my favorite entree!< /review>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>We finally stopped by this location on our way home.
Small parking area but pretty decent size facility.
Walking in, it does remind me of the Paso location's look and feel.

We were greeted but not served for over 10 min. Needless to say we were disappointed.  Paso's location has 10 times better service.  People were walking around but no one bothered to see if we wanted a beer or even if we had been helped.   Finally, a lady was walking by and my BF asked if we could get a beer.  She said it wasn't her job but that she would be glad to get us one.   We were going to get another but since our glass sat empty for alittle while and no one bothered to ask again, we just asked for the check and left.

We will not be back.  Especially since we have had way better service else where, even in Buellton.<//Review>< Pictures>

The Firestone Restaurant used to have good food. I heard the old head chef would buy fresh produce and meats almost every day. Not anymore! Had my second bad meal there. Beer good - Food bad.</Review>

I waited to seated at the podium. No one came. We seated ourselves at the bar. No one eay hello or any thing until i requested to see a menu. Slow service. Food is too expensive for the quality. Our food took so long to get to us and by the time it did melted cheese was so hard. Beers are ok not that great. Chef could do better to pair food to beers. I got the naked tri tip sandwich let me tell you. Please go back to culinary school. Or look up da smoked house in oxnard, they are doing it right and sandwich is only 11 dollars. Please hire more people to take care of your business. Need more servers to run food faster and to keep up with service. Even the waitress was complaining that she was the only one on that side of the floor</text>

It takes forever to get just a normal beer from their lineup. The food service was slow and it was just average "brown food". The Barrelworks feels full of itself. All of their artisanal beers taste like poor or incomplete fermentations. Half of the tasting area is full of swag for purchase. Feels more like the store they drag you through after the ride at Disneyland than a proper tasting room or Brewery. If they got rid of the store part they could expand the bar or add more seating<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

As a craft beer geek, this place is darn near nirvana for me. Incredible selection on tap and available for sale in bottles. Tasters are a little pricy and they needed to turn up the AC a bit but besides that I loved it here.</Text>

We had a delicious dinner, however, waitresses shouldn't blindly upsell chopped salad with chicken, steak or salmon without informing guest of added charge, esp since I said, 'oh, I didn't know the salad came with those options.' Sort of dampened our otherwise lovely experience :( I'll be mentioning this in my YELP review as well.
PS. Upselling without informing customer of the added costs, is against the law. You owe me $8.                                                                         UPDATE: I have since been refunded $8 for the illegal upsell. The manager, Kayce, was apologetic and professional. Thx Kayce!< /Review>

<review>Very pleased to have a Firestone Walker brewery in Buellton. Service was great, e.g., they ended up servicing my table with a bartender for beers and waitress for food, so my questions could be answered in discussing beer offerings. They also provided me with some complimentary samples. The food was very good and also accommodated my cole slaw substitution instead of fries. Variety of seating available from bar to bar area to more quiet seating.

As usual, Firestone Walker has a great stable of beers. They are doing some interesting batches of barrel beers (even this type usually isn't my thing). I also have enjoyed their Luponic series. Looking forward to my next visit. Their Paso Robles and Venice locations are also very good.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Come for the awesome beer, stay for the delicious food, friendly and attentive staff, and nice atmosphere! We live in Arizona, and stopped by here for a drink and a bite to eat while passing through, and will gladly come back anytime we are in the area!< /review>

A must stop if you're in the area looking for food and drink. we go camping at Refugio State Beach at least once a year and always stop here to visit the tasting room and try exotic beers. if you're a craft beer lover I don't need to tell you about Firestone.</Text>

<Text>There is no brewery tour here but the Barrelworks bar has some of the most amazing and unique beers you will ever try. There is beer here you can't get even at the Paso Robles brewery.

<Text>I stopped in for their Barrelworks taproom.  It specializes in wild and other barrel aged strong/sour ales.  I've tasted a fair share of barrel aged beers in California, and these are of very high quality.  My only complaint is the price - $3 flat for all tasters is steep.  $15 for a 375mL is also steep.  Other breweries of equal quality are more affordable, but this is a common trend.  The taproom was nice and had a view of the storage warehouse.  Also,they seemed to cater to the wine crowd of the region, and it reflected in their silly flavor descriptions which didn't include the important information.</Text>< pics>

<review>Only 6 of the 12 or so taps open and nothing darker than a pale ale.  For a dark beer fan there was nothing to recommend. I was looking forward to a pint of stout or at least an amber, but if you didn't want a hoppy yellow beer your only other option was tiny shots of their barrelworks stuff.  Ordered the fish tacos.  Disgustingly tasteless. I ate one and tasted nothing but the salt and pepper I put on it half way through.  Left me a bit nauseous and sent away the other two.  No comment from the waitress. The quesadillas with chicken came  with no chicken (didn't get upcharged once we mentioned it). I was really underwhelmed and unlikely to return.  Maybe if I'd gone whole hog and ordered the steak and whatever IPA they were pushing I would have loved it, I don't know. I don't think places should just be judged on their most popular and expensive items.  If it's not good food, don't put it on the menu.

Just looked at pics of tacos on this review site!  Hah!  Not even close!  No seasoning on fish, no salsa, 1 lime wedge, about 1/10 the crema, no cilantro, the beans were mostly a brownish green watery mess with again about 1/10 the cheese pictured.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The craft beers are amazing and there's a great variety but the SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE!! From the time we got there until we left, customer service if obviously not their strong point. We waited 25 minutes before getting up and asking for a someone to take our drink and appetizer orders. It didn't get any better with ordering entrees. In the retail store it continued, we stood by the register with our items and had to ask if we could make a purchase. The girl swiped our card without saying anything, returned it and turned her back to us. We grabbed out items and left. I will never recommend this location nor will we return. This has never happen at their Paso location.</text>

<Review>As to the brewery itself, if you like your 805 or other solid Firestone brews, then you know exactly what you're getting, except straight from the source. If you're like me, you enjoy a pleasant, knowledgeable and friendly conversational bar staff -- which is exactly what you're going to get here when you're ordering from their collection.

However, the true treat here comes in the form of Barrel Works, just in the back. Walk into the main dining area, nod and smile at all of the people, keep on walking, turn right and go into the funky room of exploration and wonderment.

That's right, you're in for a world of sour (beer)! If you've never tried sours or not had any beers crafted used wild strains of yeast, then you my friend, oh you're in for a treat. They have a rotating list of sours (10-15 depending) and strongs (7-10 depending) all of which are worth tasting. If you're in luck, you can get two of the same brews, just different releases, to try back-to-back.

When I was there last, I was lucky enough to get to try the Stickee Monkee from 2014 and the 2016. There is a difference and it's great to get them like that.

Now, if you want to take the unofficial challenge, do what I did, drink the entire list.

Probably not recommended unless you have a designated driver. If you do, then drink on my friend!

Oh, the pours are 3 oz. so you're going to be able to sample quite a few even if you don't have a friend driving you around on your tour, but be safe.

Now, have one for me!<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>I love Barrlworks. Their famous Bretta Weisse and Bretta Rose is excellent and like nothing I've ever tasted. Of course, you can't get this stuff unless you're here in their Buellton location. Most everything are in the barrels, just like what you see when you first walk in as you enter the taproom. It was nice and cool on a hot day walking through. That and a beer in your hand, makes this such a nice stop off the 101.  Tasters are $3 here.

I also recently tried one of their Feral series: Feral Vinifera Component: Orange Muscat. More on the sour side than on what I thought was sweet Muscat. Lovely to drink maybe as an aperitif or dessert., not something you will drink all the time.

So enough about their fu fu sours, if you also like their strong ales this place is a must. I got to try their Helldorado 2014 on tap. Strangely, the ABV on the 2015 is 1% higher. There is some agreesivenss in here, but it does make you want to drink more.  Definitely can taste the barrel taste.  Always a fan of their Parabola, Sticky Monkee, Sucaba.  Good stuff.

There's the fridge next to the tap which you can buy it to go. Of course, the older stuff like the Anniversary 14 or 15 is stupid expensive, I would totally just get the recent release and hope it ages fine at your own fridge.

I hope FW being bought won't change any of their beers, I love their beers and fan for life.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

We didn't get to try the food or beer, but you can't post a review without marking those labels. After being ignored for 30min by the waiter, a large group came in and sat at the table next to us where the waiter promptly served them menus, took a drink order, glanced at us and left..... So we did the same.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Craft beer 5oz Starting from $1.75, it's a great time! It was a pizza dinner that I was tired of eating, but the dough was delicious and I was very satisfied.

(Translated by Google) Pretty good beer. In the menu of 7 grades. I liked unfiltered DBA. Very interesting interior. You can go through the hall where the barrels are stored.

Довольно неплохое пиво. В меню 7 сортов. Понравилось нефильтрованное DBA. Очень интересный интерьер. Можно пройти насквозь через зал где хранятся бочки.</Review>
