<text>Highly recommend Tony’s plumbing.  The technicians were very personable and respectful of my home.  They were clearly trained and good at what they do.  They wore masks to protect us without having to ask them.  Will call again for our plumbing needs.   I particularly appreciated that there was a person, not a calling tree, that answered the phone when I called to ask for an appointment.  Cody is a Fresno State alum too!  Great service!<//text>< Date>

The technician, a young man named Frank, did an outstanding job of unclogging the pipes in our kitchen. He used a high pressure hose to remove what appeared to be an astonishing amount of grease from the pipes. After that, he installed a new J-bend under one of the sinks and explained that water in the J-bend stopped sewer gas from rising out of the sink. We’re very happy with the work he did. Well done!</Text>

Cameron was the man who came to help us with our plumbing and straight out the bat he was an extremely hard worker. He was a very cordial man who knew and spoke with the utmost respect. He was extremely helpful and that is why I'm giving him five stars and recommending him to anyone who needs any type of plumbing work done. I would use this business again in the future if needed Cameron was a very hard-working man and I appreciated everything he did to help us with our plumbing problem.<//Text>

<review>Called these guys on a Saturday to repair a service line leak.  Saw all the positive reviews so figured should be decent service.  Oh yeah it was!  Within an hour Johnny showed up and was assessing the issue.   He explained all options and best case/worst case scenarios.  Polite and patient and explained in detail what he was doing.  I don’t know if they were the most economical option as I didn’t really shop around but at this point it really doesn’t matter.   The service and response was excellent!  If you get Johnny, your in great hands!  I will definitely use them again in the future.< /review>< pics>

<review>Fernando was a really good helper he came in he gave me a good quote he did the camera in the work that needed to be due he fixed the plumbing but there's more issues involved with it like any plumbing is and found out it was the tree so it's going to cost more. to fix but it's a new house so we just moved in so there's more to be bargained for but they gave us a good invoice all very detailed what needs to be done how much it will cost and so on and so forth I can't think of enough for coming in on time instead of waiting a day or two so thank you this means a lot to me.</review>< Rate>

Receptionist was cheerful, patient, and considerate. Put me on the urgency list. Dan Loudermilk was the plumber who solved my home issue. He was professional, informative, hard working and he completed the job without any obstacles.

First of all, the company followed up for an appointment, and Timothy Werner called me to come right over. We were having issues with our water softener, for their was standing water in the tank, and our drinking water began to have a different taste. Timothy tested the water for hardness but it seemed to be working just fine, and replaced our water filter. He was very knowledgeable, and we are confident that if our water softener ever did come to fail us, we would be giving him a call back to get it replaced.</Text>

Everything went great! I really appreciated that Fernando gave me a call before he arrived and he showed up on time, wearing a mask (which is a first for tradesmen that we have called over). He had a very friendly attitude the whole time was able to unclog our drains very quickly and neatly, leaving no trace of any mess behind. He even trimmed the shower drain pipe down so that our drain cover would finally snap on!

I would recommend his service to anyone and everyone who needs plumbing work done.<//text>

<text>I contacted Tony’s Plumbing to help with my leaking kitchen sink that I wasn’t able to utilize at all. They informed me that they had a full schedule, however they would put this down on their urgency list so that as soon as a technician is available, they would contact me. Less than 2 hours later, Dan arrived at our door to save the day. He was so kind & professional. I cannot express enough how grateful I am that they were able to help us so promptly. I will definitely call them again for any water/ plumbing related needs!<//text>< pics>

I had called for service to repair a leak on the main water riser for my house. Spoked with Cameron day before repair. Described to him the   service that I need. While talking to Cameron he was very professional and explained the cost to me. I send him photos that needed repair. From there he gave me a fair price. Next day he came to repair water leak. Cameron repaired leak very professionally and the quality of work was awesome. I will use Tony’s Plumber again if I need of a service.

Our sinks, toilets, showers, and tub all backed up with water while we were doing laundry. We called Tony's Plumbing Services and they immediately dispatched a plumber. Johnny, the plumber who was sent to us, was at our house within fifteen minutes. He was a very positive person and was very knowledgeable. We couldn't find out clean-out so the toilet had to be removed. Johnny was very conscientious about cleaning up the water and any mess in the bathroom. The clog was fixed and the toilet re-installed within 45 minutes of his arrival. I HIGHLY recommend this company for their quick response and professional work!</review>

Robin came to our home today(on time) to help us with some issues with water pressure in our faucets in the bathroom and kitchen. He was very knowledgeable, explained why we were having the issues we were and was able to take care of several problems for us. We will ask for Robin again whenever we have plumbing problems< /review>

I would recommend Tony's Plumbing to anyone with plumbing issues.
The tech, Robin, was punctual, personable, and knowledgeable.  He used the Hydrojetter to clear my pipes and he cleaned up after the process.< /Review>

We had a clog on Christmas Day. Called a few plumbers and ended up using Tony’s plumbing. The best call we made. Talked to Robin and he said he could be right out and he was. He fixed our problem and gave us a quote on a clean out so it would be a lot better if we have a clog again. He was on time very friendly and professional. It’s nice to have somebody come to your house knowing what they are doing. Robin went above and beyond and I can’t thank him enough. I would definitely recommend Tony’s Plumbing to anyone who’s looking for a plumber. The best price in town. Thank You very much Robin Jarret and Tony’s Plumbing< /Text>

I had a clogged double kitchen sink with very slow draining problem so the sink was unusable. The old garbage disposal was also leaking and seemed not very efficient though it didn’t get heavy use over the years. Two great guys came out early the next day and recommended replacement of the 12 year old garbage disposal and snaking the drain using the clean-out under the sink. It all works fine and  everything was done in about 2 hours for a reasonable price. I’d definitely recommend this business.< /Text>

< Review>
I called Tony’s Plumbing Service on a Sunday. Within 10 minutes, Robin was at my house. As a courtesy, he checked my sewer drain/line and detected a blockage in the street. He called the City of Modesto and they came out to remove the blockage. I am totally amazed with the service received! Robin was very knowledgeable about plumbing issue; he was prompt and provided great service! The price estimates  given to me for other plumbing services seemed very reasonable. I recommend Tony’s Plumbing for all your plumbing needs! Extremely professional company!</Review>

<Review>My water heater stopped working and call serveral local plumbing companies. Tony's was the first to response and came out the next day. Johnny arrived on time, was polite and knowledgeable and was wearing a mask! He quickly diagnosed my problem and gave me serveral options. My water heater is now back working. I'll definitely call Tony's again in the future for any plumbing services!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I am very pleased with the service I received. When one finds themselves in a situation such as myself with finding a water pipe broken and leaking, it is quite a stressful experience. I have a water meter installed at my house, and to have water spilling out needlessly is definitely an added cost nobody needs or wants. Luckily I was able to turn my water off from the main valve and immediately I called Tony's Plumbing Services. The call only took about 5 minutes. Shortly after I received a text and an email confirming my request for service with the window of time expected for service to arrive. I was very pleased when Cameron and Alberto showed up 4 hours earlier than expected. I know they had a busy day, and it is much appreciated for their prompt arrival. I let Alberto know my situation and shared whatever details needed. Cameron and Alberto quickly got to working on fixing my broken water pipe. Also upon inspection, Cameron made mention any perceivable issues that might arise because of how short of a water pipe there was left to work with. The issue was all explained and I was able to understand, and we came to an agreement to make sure the job was completed properly. I very much appreciate Cameron's and Alberto's focus on doing a job properly and I am more than pleased to leave this positive review. Especially in this rainy weather we are experiencing today. Great attitudes. Very helpful. And upon leaving, Cameron informed me he will gladly warrent the work and to make sure to inspect the pipe after the rain lets off to make sure the pipe is free of any leaks giving me his assurance he will gladly return to fix any issues. Definitely much appreciated. Nobody likes to deal with emergencies and costs of home maintenance, but I sure am glad to have the professional help available.

If you're looking for a professional, quality plumber, then call Tony's Plumbing. I can't say enough about Robin's customer service.  It was above and beyond any other plumber that I have used.

<Review>Cameron used a 110 ft snake, a second snake with a camera to visualize and locate a soft clog at the main pipe site that held the 14 ft
soft clog, which started in a sag in the main pipe. He then used a tool to locate the sag in the pipe and mark it with green spray paint on the street asphalt. The long soft clog had been cleared by the 1st snake, then visualized by the 2nd snake's camera, then the sag site was located with the 3rd tool and marked on the street. This all cleared my problem, which involved backing up of my master toilet, which backed up in my master shower drain, my guest toilet, which backed up in my guest  bathtub, and both sink drains in my kitchen. Cameron and his trainee, Albert, were fantastic! What a wonderful experience! They were both very respectful and polite. They listened n were very patient and professional. As well, Cameron was very intelligent and knew exactly what to use to achieve his goals. It was a complex issue that Cameron was suited for. I am so impressed, especially since the 1st company (a very well known company and reputable, too) that I called yesterday could not clear the clog after working with a 150 ft snake over 3 hours. Cameron explained everything he found, what it meant,, every step of his process, his solutions, and met goals. Again, I am so impressed with him I will recommend him to everyone in need of his expertise!!! Thank you, Tony's Plumbing!!! Cameron IS A KEEPER!!! He was PERFECT for training Albert!! And, Albert was very attentive, very helpful, very appreciative and impressed with Cameron!!! Cameron will be able to repair my sagging pipe in the main line.

Tony's repaired our leaky shower faucet. It took less than an hour as he had a replacement for the broken part in his van. Was a bit pricey but seems like any repairs always are...< /Text>

< Review>
They were three gentlemen that came into my house. They first asked Respectfully prior to entering If they needed their mask. I told them no. I was comfortable without a mask on if they were. They were all very friendly. Come to find out my pilot light on my water heater was not lighting because they button had not been held down long enough. So they were there for literally 5-7 minutes and fixed the problem. I have not had warm water for 7 days! I was very grateful that it was an easy fix and by a very respectful trio. Definitely referring this company to others in the future!!!!!</Review>

<review>We had our water heater go out and Robin from Tony’s Plumbing was our plumber. He was knowledgeable, did NOT try to oversell me like Brand X came and did, and was detailed in his explanation of what happened and the best way to replace it. He was on time the day of install and was done in a reasonable amount of time and the job looked amazing! I’ve had some really awful plumbers, they either tried to rip me off or they did poor work but Tony’s has been my absolute best experience so far. I refuse to use anyone else at this point! Any company that will give me a tentative estimate over the phone tells you that this company is charging ALL OF US the same amount (minus incidentals) and not trying to overcharge people with less knowledge on the subject like some places do. So if you need a plumber in the 209 area code I suggest you use them! You will not regret it, and ask for Robin to be your tech!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Our water heater went out, and after dealing with our home warranty company (which was a complete and total nightmare), I went searching for someone to fix or replace it as soon as possible. I first spoke with Andrew, and he actually spent the time to inform me about water heaters and their life spans, the factories and where the parts come from, pricing, etc. I am so appreciative of just that time he took on the phone with me when we were in a stressful situation. After going back and forth with our warranty company, we decided to just replace the unit ourselves. We contacted this business to let them know of our decision, and within 24 hours they had two technicians out to replace our water heater. They came out a day earlier than they said they would, were right on time with the window they gave me on the phone, and were so genuine and sweet! They had our water heater totally replaced in maybe 2 hours or less. I will call them and use this business right away if we have any other plumbing issues.

The plumbing tech from Tony's, Sam, was highly recommended by my mother-in-law, and I am happy to report that the recommendation was right on!  Sam was very pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient in the disposal replacement.  He gave some very helpful advice as to what the company could do with our bathroom sinks if a problem should develop due to my previously done makeshift repair job.</Review>

<text>Johnny and Mikeal (sorry if I spelling that wrong) came out to my house after my bathroom from hell started acting up again. Both were very professional and honest about what was going on with my plumbing issues. The resolved it quickly and gave me a recommendation on what else needed to he done in order to prevent the problems from continuing. Their solutions were much more pratical than mine (cleaning the bathroom with dynamite). Definitely will be using this company again.<//text>< pictures>

Tony’s is great! I had an outdoor pipe corrode through and burst early in the morning. Cameron and team came the same day and fixed it all. The new piping looks great and leak free, and most of all, the crew was friendly, professional, and completely transparent regarding the type of work we were looking at. They did a great job explaining both best case and worst case scenarios. Thankfully, it was best case and smooth sailing. Thanks to everyone from Tony’s!<//review>

Dwayne came by to work on a remodel and we immediately connected. He gave good sound advice on the in-wall toilet which also gave me more room. Though he may have regretted it due to the extra work required 😊
He had all the right tools, even though they weren’t Dwalt 😊
He was pleasant and we had a few good laughs. I would highly recommend Tony’s Plumbing and Dwayne and Johnny especially. Thanks guys for the good work and many laughs.< /text>

I called 3 places before this company and I got outrageous quotes and no definitive solutions. This was the cheapest and most thorough business I dealt with. Especially considering this was the only company that solved the issue. They even wiped down the gloors on their way out. Very happy customer here.</text>

<text>Great customer service! They came out to my home to unclog a drain the same day and were actually at my home within a couple of hours from when I first called.

Robin and James were real gentlemen. Robin explained everything very well and had the issue resolved very quickly. He not only solved the issue but was very helpful with additional information.

Very satisfied with the great service!

Tony's Plumbing is a first class organization. The plumbers in site were on time, professional and most importantly they did great work. Tony's is exigencies in my opinion, but I couldn't wait for others to be available just to save a buck or two. If you want it fine right, go with Tony's.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I called Tony's Plumbing Service after having a poor experience with Herk's Plumbing. The person I spoke with when I called was friendly and offered to get someone out right away. Frank came out within an hour of me calling and was able to correct the issue we were having with our toilet that Herk's Plumbing was unable or unwilling to fix. Frank was kind, professional and respected our house by wearing shoe covers and a mask. We will definitely keep this company in mind for our future plumbing needs.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Recently purchased a home in Modesto that came with a tankless hot water heater. It was not preforming like it should, and I assume it was never serviced by the previous owners. I had been looking for an outfit that services these to no avail and most wanted outrageous prices for a simple flush and service. Happened to run into Samuel with Tonys plumbing doing some work for a neighbor. After speaking with him, I felt the price was fair and set up an appointment. He did a great job and now it is running like it should. These guys are fair and honest. You can just tell. Will certainly be using them for all my future plumbing needs.< /Review>

Fantastic service tech, Tim, who was fast,  efficient and really knew his business. Beyond that he has a great personality and fun to deal with. He is a great asset to Tony's plumbing.  Beyond that he knew immediately what needed to be done to repair my loose kitchen faucet and restore the water flow.  Do not hesitate to hire this first class plumbing firm.< /review>

I was having trouble with water pressure from my kitchen sink.  Technician came out & fixed the problem that had been causing us issues for weeks....and it took him about 15 minutes.  I tried EVERYTHING....just goes to show that sometimes a professional is needed.  Excellent service & nice people.  Will use them every time I need a plumber & I suggest you do as well.< /text>

<review>I currently own and operate 3 businesses here locally. First time I had plumbing issue ISAAC came out and helped me fixed my prob. It was little thing but he helped me and didn't charge me anything. But thats not what I was happy w most. What I like about him was his customer service. He was humble and easy going. Kept it real and honest. Second time I called the company, ISAAC came out again. I didnt meet him but I recognized his voice. This kid is what makes this company shine. He was same ol down to earth humble guy. Got the job done and told me thank you. So I wanted to go meet him personally and pay him. When I saw Him I asked if he was the same guy that fixed my other store and he confirmed. I appreciate ppl that do their jobs w a passion. It makes me feel at ease knowing that they'll get the job done right. I gave him a small tip for appreciation. Sometimes its the employees that makes determines the company's outlook. Will def be a repeat customer for all business/house projects</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1612975178625, 'text': "Hello Mai! Thank you so much for a glowing review for Isaac.

<Review>I texted Tony's Plumbing Service yesterday afternoon to see about a quote for a water line installation for my refrigerator. They texted back promptly and were very professional. They sent out one of their technicians, Samuel, this morning to inspect and give me a quote, and by this afternoon I already have running water and ice in my refrigerator/freezer. Samuel worked very quickly and did a great job. He was respectful and professional as well. We will be using Tony's plumbing service going forward! They do great work and the service is very reasonably priced!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Came by right on the expected time, had a courtesy call 15 min prior to arrival. Came inside with floor protectors over shoes which was greatly appreciated. Cameron was our service person, he was courteous and finished the repair quickly and did not leave a mess. Im very happy and i would use Tonys again in the future.< /text>

<review>I'm leaving this on behalf of my dad: he made an appointment with Tony's to get his garbage disposal fixed and to replace the faucets in his home. The guys arrived right on time and were done within a few hours. He's very satisfied with the work done, everything looks and works great, and they left no mess! Absolutely recommend them for your plumbing needs. Nothing like quality work, quality service, and no hassle. Many thanks, Tony's Plumbing! I like getting a call from my dad being happy about good work done at his house 👍🏼.</review><resp>{'time': 1594745874721, 'text': "Thank you so much for the feedback!

<text>I had the pleasure of meeting Robin earlier he came to clear out a root intrusion that caused a break in the under ground sewage piping. Great guy, he was cordial and even guided me on how to take care of problem indefinitely by contacting the city to get rid of the tree that caused the break. I almost wish we have a another reason for him to come back out again!<//text>< Pics>

My 6 year old flushed a toy flash light down the toilet. I called and Robin showed up 30 minutes later. He was professional, fast, and was able to get it out!! This is the second time I had to call. Last time it was a toy car. Same company same kid!! I highly recommend them!< /review>

We had a plumbing emergency and Tony's plumbing showed up promptly, and fixed the problem quickly and effectively. Great communication, and charged exactly what they quoted. I definitely recommend Tony's Plumbing to anyone, and will be using their services again myself in the future.</Review>

Called today for water heater replacement. Had a leak that was working up my walls. Were at my house within 45 minutes, checked water heater, it was fine. Leak was coming from pipe inside wall. Repaired leak, cleaned up, all the while explaining to me what had happened at what he was doing. Dwayne- the repairman, does not get paid enough. I have never been so impressed with a service and the company.<//Text>

Our Technician arrived and immediately addressed the issue and resolved our shower clog within minutes and he couldn't have been more professional. He explained our plumbing situation to us and was incredibly helpful. I wish I could remember his name, but he was such a help. Thank you!!!<//Review>

Johnathan arrived and resolved my plumbing needs and did it in a professional manner, was quoted before any work got done so I appreciated the honesty and integrity of Johnathan in the initial meeting then went straight to work and was able to resolve my clogged kitchen drain which I know was no easy feat as my house is older and has older plumbing, 5 stars all the way, I would recommend you call this company for any and all plumbing needs. Professional, prompt and honest.</text>

<Text>I could not be happier with Tony's plumbing service right now. My water heater system, on the roof of my laundromat business, stopped working. I first called other commercial plumbers and boiler service companies in the area. They either said they didn't know how to work on my system, or just didn't even return my calls. Then I called Tony's. Within a couple of hours, Cameron showed up. He too said he never worked on my exact system before, but he agreed to take a look at it. Within a couple of hours, he had it back up and producing hot water again. The service charge was very fair and reasonable as well. Thanks for your quick response and expert services.< /Text><user_id>104486557607556975926< /user_id><Name>Phread 1</Name></record></dataset><record>

Isaac, from Tony's Plumbing Service, recently installed a bidet for us and he did an excellent installation job. Plus, he adjusted the toilet and it works better than it has in years. :-)

We recently used Tony's Plumbing again for a clogged toilet & faucet repair. And, the service again was excellent!
Review from 8/3/2019: We had a water leak under our kitchen sink. Isaac from Tony's Plumbing Services determined the cause and fixed it within 5 minutes. He didn't even charge us because it was a simple fix. He was great. He took the time to explain the issue, plus he was super-friendly and professional.
Review from 2018: I highly recommend Tony's Plumbing Services. They were able to fix our issues the same day we called. Cameron was friendly, professional, and he did an excellent job!< /text>

Thier prices are fair and they do not try to sell you on things you do not need. They do however pay attention to all aspects of a repair, so you aren't calling them the next day due to a repair going wrong.
I have never spoken to an owner, there are office managers that handle all the tasks at hand. They try to provide service asap, but do get busy on occassion, as all companies do. I haven't had issues with them showing up late or not at all, and I have used them dozens of times, but this is a business that requires patience as things can go unexpected with a job prior to yours. Keep mind you'd want a plumber or electrician to finish your problem before leaving too, so lateness can be forgiven at times. I have received a call to prepare me for any delay in advance as well.
I'm beginning to think that the 1 star reviews they are receiving are fake users made by other companies to bring down thier score. You never see a company get either 1 star or 5 stars. That's a bit ridiculous and unbelievable. Sad really, but I have seen that done before. I think it should be investigated personally. It's too easy to make a google account. I am a real person, if someone would like to email me to confirm.
Thank you Tony's plumbing for being a 5 star company, you will always have my loyalty as a customer.< /Review>< Time>

Called out to plumb multiple units in an apartment building. Plumber did one unit before packing up and leaving, without verifying the job had actually been completed. This has happened over a dozen times over the last 12 months (old, poorly designed system). This is the only plumbing service my management company is willing to use because they are cheap. Pay cheap prices, get cheap service.
Owner also does not know proper telephone etiquette. When he is done talking, he hangs up. Glad to know you think your time is more important than being polite.
After the management company called to complain that they did not verify that the job was completed before leaving, the owner came back to give me attitude. Apparently he didn’t need to make sure the job was done before leaving because he “knew” it was. That’s some real great customer service. It’s always a good idea to try and intimate the people keeping you in business.< /Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>I highly recommend using Tony's Plumbing Services. Called Tony's Plumbing out to unclog our mainline that was backing everything up.

Nathan came out and was very professional and easy to work with. I informed him of what was going on and he gave me his recommendation and some options.

He installed a two way clean out and was able cutout several feet of roots in our mainline and ran a camera to show the results. We are all set for a few years. We will just need a maintenance visit every few years to keep the roots out.

Thank You Nathan and Tony's Plumbing Services!<//Review>< user_name>

Tend to be late and they charged way more than the original quote.  Add that to the low quality of the work and it's a true 1 star company.< /review>

I had fortunately an easy fix.  The serviceman came out promptly and was very friendly.  He was done quickly and explained everything.  He even reminded me of the discount coupon in the phone book.  Highly recommend.</review>

Great service. Called last week (10/13/17) and they did a free estimate that week, this week (10/20/17)they followed up immediately and service took less than two hours. Johnny was the gentleman who came out, he is full of energy and told me exactly what was wrong and what he was going to do to fix it.< /Review>

Sal of Tonys came out to look at my galvanized pipes and get me an estimate. He also said I had bad ABS drain lines, supposedly made during the time my house was built. I never received an estimate for anything, so I called the office and the lady knew who I was but she said Sal never gave her anything for my property. She said she'd get the info and send me a quote. It's been over a month, and I still have not received anything. And the bad ABS he wanted me replace wasn't even manufactured when my house was built; the date codes prove it... they are not from the bad batch of ABS.< /review>

I hired Tony's Plumbing for the garbage disposal and a broken faucet knob that were broken by tenant. I had my cleaner to let Plumber Author in. He fixed the garbage disposal and he said he had no parts for the broken faucet knob and to come the next day but he never showed up. After fixing the disposal, Author called me to tell me there are other plumbing problems and I told him I saw  no other problems when I was there few days prior. I hired my handyman to fix the faucet knob and had him check what Author was saying as other problems and my handyman said there were no problems. Then I called Tony's Plumbing 15 days after for the receipt which was paid prior to the job. Kathy at their office took six hours to email the reciept. I am very disappointed that there are companies out there that under estimate the knowledge of other people.< /Review>

Friendly loving care, curb side pick up. I took my birdie there who had a problem with her eye and was not feeling well,  turned out she had an infection. They prescribed pain medication and antibiotics and it really helped. Thank you.< /Text>

I thought instead of putting pictures of the building or something I put pictures of the patients that's my mama kitty and one of the kittens that I am having fixed by the clinic. It always makes me ask a question were they broken to begin with? As is the case these days since the covid you don't go in the people come out and they take your nice kitties away and they are nice to your kitties while they have them and then they bring them back and put them in your car for you so that you don't even have to carry the carrier! Nice people and Dr Sarah I had previous affiliation with it another clinic so I was relieved to have her do the surgery on my kitties. One down and two to go to get them fixed. I'll share more experience as I get the two kittens fixed out there.<//Review>

Thank you to the entire staff for taking such good care of us during our time in need. We highly recommend Granite Bay Veterinary Clinic!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

We’ve been taking our pets to Dr. Bradley since she took over the business from the previous vet who retired. Dr. Bradley and her staff are highly skilled, professional, friendly and compassionate. It gives you peace of mind when you trust the people who take care of your pets. We can’t say enough good things about Dr. Bradley and her staff.< /review>

< Review>
This place is the best place ever. There is not enough space on this page to say all the good things about this clinic. Top notch Doctors and the people who help the Doctors are the best. It does not matter what you are taking your pet there for big or small problems, they treat each pet as though they were the only one in the world. I would never take my pets anywhere else. Now for the ladies at the front desk, I love each and everyone. They care just as much as the Doctors do about your pets well being. So friendly just a pleasure to be around. Althought I know ther is nothing that is perfect in this world they are as close as you can get.<//Review>

We have been going to Dr Bradley for years. Not only is she extremely knowledgeable, but she is extremely compassionate as well. We would absolutely recommend Granite Bay to anyone in search of a vet, by far the best vet we have ever had</review>

<Review>Dr. Bradley, in my opinion and experience in 35+ years as a pet owner is without peer equal; and that is not knocking other outstanding vets whom we have had over the years.
She and her well-managed and motivated staff are hyper focused on ensuring that our dogs receive the best care possible.
Dr. Bradley is a tireless worker for good.  No matter what time of day I have been in there to have our dogs taken care of, she is fresh, focused and forever attending to the needs of our dogs as if they are her sole concern.
I am always encouraged when I meet with her.  She is upbeat, compassionate, professional, incredibly knowledgeable and extremely pleasant.  Her ‘bedside manner’ with our dogs and with my wife or me is superb.  We count ourselves grateful to have her in the lives of our dogs.< /Review><user>105714707881630066554<//user></record></dataset><record>

We've known Dr. Bradley for many years and have always respected her and her work. She's compassionate and informative and is a wonderful vet. We now live in Lincoln but I will continue to make the drive to Granite Bay to make sure my two dogs will be seen by Dr. Bradley. You can rest assured your animals will be well cared for at Granite Bay Vet! Thanks Dr. Bradley!< /review>

<review>I boarded my dog with them for a couple weeks and found my dog dead upon my return.  No explanation or investigstion, just "Here's your dead dog", and then they still charged me for boarding.  If you're okay with that, then these are the vets for you.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1571091350409, 'text': 'We are very sorry for your sudden and profound loss of your beloved companion.

The main thing on the menu are Cemitas. The name refers to both the sandwich as well as the bread itself. Made from eggs and covered with sesame seeds it resembles brioche, a kind of flatbread. The stuff inside is traditionally made up of sliced avocados, meat, white cheese, onions, the herb pápalo and a sauce.

These sandwiches are amazing. I mean, you think you know what you're going to get from that description I gave before...'everything from a taco, but on bread'...and then it's so much more. The combo of Carnitas, the fresh onion, some unknown chipotle flavored sauce, that bun with insides toasted with butter, all sitting on a bed of shredded Mexican cheese...washed down with ice cold real Coke, talk about a great lunch.

A nice little unassuming restaurant
It's a chill place to sit and have a conversation while enjoying some really tasty food. There's a good selection of sodas...Coke, Fanta, Mandarin...the good stuff. It's also really affordable. For 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks it only set us back $20. There were more expensive and less expensive dishes on the menu, but you'd have to work hard to go broke before you were stuffed. Just one sandwich had me sitting back with a satisfied smile.<//text>

<rate>4</rate><text>Okay so here's the deal. This restaurant is located on 1st street, across the evergreen cemetery. The food is a 5!!
The mole is the sweet type with a nice spicy kick. It's authentic sweet mole poblano as it can get.  I even asked them where they're from and they said  Magdalena. Which isn't far from my parents city.
Their milanesa cemitas are always soft. But a friend once said they were hard once. But the times I've gone they have always been soft. You can pick out your own drink from the fridge they charge after you've eaten. I'd rather pay for my meal before hand. When you go in early you can smell the cleaning products because they mopped/cleaned. Its pleasant.

Okay and this is the reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. Sometimes if you come during a slow time they're not in the front and you kinda have to yell in to get service since they can't hear you because of the loud music. Also when you pay i usually have  to wait  5 mins to pay which is why I'd rather pay before hand</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGwGvWb0Z4zwLCs4neYImEkcv1UDqVHbRYxU4v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhuuDqqz-sN5BEtq8X-cox_RUtz8Gu6qBN_V1O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Great cemita place
You cant go wrong getting milanesa (breaded meat) or pierna
If they ask if you want “papalo” ask for it on the side its a plant that has a strong taste you might like it or not
Also try picaditas they might look sinple but are very flavorful</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< review>
I'd literally go out of my way to eat here, that's how good they are. I haven't had any bad luck here or experience. Maybe one but it was insignificant so won't really count it. The cemas are fkn good. 10/10 for me. They are good size and the huitlacoche ( corn smut, corn truffle) quesadilla is always great because is hand made tortilla. I most of the time get cueritos or milanesa and the consistency hasn't disappoint. They accept both cards and cash so that's convenient but they do charge for using card. They menu is a good size so you got a good amount of options. The men's restroom is inside the kitchen just so you know. Will keep coming and if  anything were to happen, I won't hesitate to update.</review>

The Cemitas are really good and I'd definitely come back here over other local Cemita places in L.A. - however they are not exactly as nicely packed with fillings like in Mexico and the bread is much softer. They don't serve free drinking water - they sell bottled water.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a pleasant service, it reminded me of Puebla since they had Papalo and cheese and that only makes it original, it is true that since the populated Semites there is no place that can be equaled by the difference in bread and meat freshly slaughtered animal) the taste is very different. But I still liked this place a lot

(Original)
Es un servicio agradable, me recordó a puebla ya que tenían Papalo y quesillo y eso solo lo hace original es verdad que como las  semitas pobladas no hay un lugar que se pueda igualar por la diferencia del pan y de la carne (puebla comes carne de animal recién sacrificado) el sabor es muy diferente. Pero igual me gusto mucho este lugar<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Don't waste your time coming to this place. The lady who takes your order has a completely inattentive and very moody attitude. I ordered a cemita of carnitas with little crows. And the little bodies were horrible and tasted like spoiled. I explained to the rocking chair and he just moved his shoulders and said ok. He did nothing to fix it or to check if the meat is really bad. Anyway! The worst experience I have had in years.

(Original)
No pierdan su tiempo en venir a este lugar. La señora que toma tu orden tiene una actitud completamente desatenta y de muy mal humor. Pedí una cemita de carnitas con cueritos. Y los cueritos estaban horribles y sabían a echados a perder. Le expliqué  a la mecera y sólo movió los hombros y dijo ok. No hizo nada por solucionarlo o por checar si de verdad la carne está mala. En fin! La peor experiencia que he tenido en años.< /text>

Ive tried every mexican resturuant in the murrieta/temecula area and these guys are the best. Ive lived here over 7 years and they are the most consistant. Only had a few problems with them over the years but for the most part they are great. And if you like alot of salsa go here. They will never charge you extra for 10 salsa cups. 5 star service and 5 star food :)</Text>

Arrived at the drive thru 15 min before closing time. There were 3 cars ahead of me. Pulled up in front of  the order sign and waited over 10 min. When the other cars were all  gone,  I pulled up to the  window, just a few minutes until 11. was told that they were closed. Would have been nice to have told me that over the speaker. Don't think I will go back and be embarrassed again.<//text>

Place is pretty solid. Huge burritos. Their monster burrito is the size of a newborn baby. Specials for every day of the week. Breakfast is really good too. If you are hungry, hungover, or whatever the case may be, go here for good Mexican food.</text>

<text>I was a little disappointed at first I came in for a cali surf and Miriam told me that she was very sorry that they did not have shrimp  at this time. So I settled for the cali burrito which was delicious but I'm going to have to go back for my cali surf.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Good drunk food only because it's a drive through and open late. Chorizo burrito was good! Gordita, and the original burrito were meh. Very Americanized and flavorless , if you want real Mexican this isn't the place for you. But if you are desperate for good, give it a go!<//Review>

<Text>The Lady who attended me was so nice but as soon as I got my order it wasn't what I expected. I ordered a bowl salad I think that was the name, with carne asada and not cheese and not sour cream. What I got was with cheese and cream and it wasn't carne asada it was shredded beef from can and I don't want to say about what my friend got< /Text><Rate>1</Rate>< time>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>The people are nice here but the food is mediocre at best. It's a bit overpriced for what you get. A lot of the burrito I got was just filler and there wasn't anything special about it. If you're in a crunch at the gas station it's better than the beef jerky buy I would recommend any other place for mexican food.< /Review>< Pictures>

If I could put NO star would be it !! Most disappointing , and frustrating experience. We never had an issue with Primos when we lived in SD. Tonight I went thru the drive thru on Winchester and the order was chicken nachos , bean and rice burrito (NO cheese) ,, the  receipt says it , yet was given Nacho Fries , and 1/2 a burrito full of cheese. So a dinner we couldn’t eat and  Topper I tipped , spent over $30 and tried 10 times calling and NO response! I have photos of what we got with receipt. Now reading reviews they seem to do poor business and not taking care of their customers.< /Text>

When you first walk in the menu can be a bit daunting as there are so many delicious options to choose from! Usually on the side there is a breakdown of all ingredients but if not, the pamphlet menu does. Both their breakfast burritos and regular burritos are awesome. Portions are large so it will take many trips to conquer this menu! They also offer complimentary chips and a salsa bar if you want some. Well worth a stop to eat!</text>

A-mazing food!!!!!  Little hole im the wall place, compared to the chain restaurants, but thats what im always looking for, unless rushed. The food was incredible !!! When we arrived, the place was empty. Then when I looked up a few minutes later, there wasn't any place to sit. No wonder this was so popular! Great food,. nice portions, friendly staff!!<//Text>

First time coming to this location, my children burrito was half cold, the Manzanita soda DID not taste like Manzanita, the torta deal doesn't seem like a deal unless 10fries and half a spoonful of rice is what you expect as for the meat in the torta that was hard, and the Pepsi drink tasted bad too. Came here because of the good reviews but left unhappy.< /Review>

<Review>I live down the street and come here at least once a week. I spend $30-$40 here everytime I come. This time I ordered the wrong burrito and even though I came back within minutes, with the receipt and whole burrito...the lady said she couldn't exchange it because it wasn't there fault, it was mine. I even offered to pay the difference on the other burrito but she said no and then turned to talk to the other ladies. They actually made the other (more expensive) Monster burrito I ordered WRONG...they forgot the sour cream. I had already dropped the kids off at home and didn't want to come back a third time out of principle.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I am beyond upset with this place. Used to be my regular. I always go through the drive thru after a long day and get surf and turf. I waited almost 30 minutes in the drive thru with only one car ahead of me the whole time and they forgot the shrimp. How you forget to put the surf in a surf and turf idk. But after noticing once I got home I had to go back to have them correct it and it just wasn't worth it. Said their manager is on vacation. Spent an hour over a burrito. Never coming back again.< /text>

You guys charge $12.00 for your so called "super nachos" and it's mostly chips and barley any meat, it is a total rip off and at Albertos down the street you pay $7 for a Monster plate of Nachos your guys are a** and overcharge your food that's not worth it. I highly do not recommend
Primos Mexican restaurant.</Review>

I always get good service. I recommend going inside to get your food though due to the fact that the drive thru wait times are usually pretty long. The only gripe I have with this place and it seems to be any of the Los Primos locations is that they don't list drink prices on the menu boards. That's an issue that needs to be addressed.</Review>

As I wait in my car waiting for my food all I can hear is the cooks non stop coughing, as I look towards the back I can see people coughing with out covering up...i hope this isn't normal practice, because this is how people get sick...in the food industry you wash and keep things clean...not coughing all over the place...when I'm at work if you have a cold you take it easy and cover up, if you have a flu you stay home so you don't get everyone sick let alone contaminate and make customers sick... I will never go back...
What I saw was just plain careless and gross...btw I used to visit the place on average 5-10 times a month for the last 2 years...makes me wonder what else goes on that I didn't see</review>

Los primos is usually a good solid go to for some quick and fairly good mexican food to go. The staff was very friendly on my last visit when i stopped in for a breakfast burrito in a hurry.< /review>

About 2 1/2 hrs later I was in the work bathroom stall violently ill. I was so sick that I couldn't even leave the company bathroom to go home. The only good thing to come of this is everyone in our company knows not to eat here. Never eating here again.< /review><userid>118443308458924807084<//userid>< pictures>

This is my favorite place for comfort food and/or my cheat meal. I always get a california burrito either human size or monster (those are the only options). But hot damn it is amazing, the monster burrito is about the size of my forearm and is simply fantastic after a long week. This place also has super great platters and tacos. You can order pretty much anything off the menu and not go wrong. I highly reccomend this place to anyone who wants some delicious late night Mexican food. Also a bonus is they stay open till around midnight usually and are on ubereats. Overall a fantastic place to spend 8-15$ on food.< /Text>

It was my second visit. I ordered adobada Nachos. Thirty minutes later I was having severe nausea. A little after that I was violently ill. I can't even stomach the smell inside the establishment without feeling queezy. Still trying to contact restaurant about it. No response after three attempts.<//Review>

< Review>
This place is a good step above a typical fast food Mexican place. The nice thing about this location in particular is that it does have a drive thru and it's open 24 hours Thursday thru Saturday. They cook to order so don't expect the food to come out fast. The food is decent, but some of the cheese doesn't taste real and has a strange flavor to it. Also, there have been times where the guacamole tasted as if a jar of salt accidentally fell into the bowl. The service is ok. Still it's a great option for late night eats and one of the few in the area.< /Review>

A good Starbucks in a good location. Warm and friendly inside and the service is good. Cozy and quiet place. Wi-Fi is great but they need more power plugs.< /review>

Today was both. I asked for a venti chai tea latte hot, and not only did they take 10 minutes to make it and mess up my drink, but they were our of straws. I am going to start going to the Starbucks down the street from now on.</review>< pics>

It's usually possible to get a seat either inside or outside, and the wait isn't too terribly long for a drink, even if they are inundated with customers from the movie theater down the street, the shops around them in the plaza, and by the teens from the local high school.</text>

Wow wow you can pick flavors and toppings yourself and then they weight and charge you. It tastes good and you can make whatever you want. It tastes great.</review>

My favorite place to go on Wednesdays because they have Waffle cones for free. The flavors are great, and I usually like to go for the fruity flavors so that I can top it off with some of their fresh fruit toppings. I also love to get the popping boba. Sometimes I wish I could go and just get a bowl of the toppings because they're so good and they have a huge variety.< /Review>

Loved it! At least a dozen flavors and at least twice that in toppings! The guy at the counter was super friendly and helpful and he was so sweet to my kid! Unusual these days where you can hardly get a shop employee to acknowledge you. The only downside was that it was cold and a bit sparse - not comfortable with the hard metal chairs and tables and kind of cavernous space. Ambiance aside, we'll be back!!</text>

Menchie's has a self-service system where you pay based on how much you serve yourself. The selections are wide, basic nutritional information is posted next to the flavors, there are various a sugar-free and low calorie options, and extensive information on ingredients and more details are available on request.

The shop is clean and bright with plenty of seating. The staff is very helpful and friendly, clearly management is hands on. I'm going to be a regular.</text>

<text>This place is fantastic. I don't usually like fro-yo, but love their offerings here. ps: My 9year old accidentally left a 1 star review using my computer but he told me he absolutely loves Menchie's-- and asked me to change the review. :-)< /text>< Pictures>

My go-to place for frozen yogurt in Berkeley. The staff is always Pleasant and professional. The yogurt is really good - especially after they mixing some additional goodies.</Text>

< Review>
Easily the best froyo in East bay. Huge selection of yogurt flavors, every topping possible, and even a big selection of syrups! (The marshmallow topping syrup was awesome). Lots of tables inside for groups, some seats out front as well. Parking can be tricky as there is only street parking and lots of students in this area.</Review>

<Date>1539863225605< /Date><review>(Translated by Google) Frozen yogurt shop in other states in the United States and Bicqlo in Tokyo. It's sold by weight, so it's not an easy price, but since we do happy hour every day, you can enjoy it at a great deal. I walk a little from the nearest station, but I think the frozen yogurt after a walk on the university campus is good!

アメリカ国内他の州や東京のビックロにもあるフローズンヨーグルトのお店。量り売りなので決してお手軽価格とは言えませんが、毎日ハッピーアワー的なのをやっているので、それに合うととてもお得に楽しむことができます。最寄り駅からは少し歩きますが、大学構内散歩したあとのフローズンヨーグルトは良いと思います！< /review>< Response>

Beautiful location off the beaten path. Still get cool coastal breezes even when smoking hot in Santa Ynez valley. A little bit of highway 101 drone in the background when outside.<//review>

< review>
Every visit to this winery has been fantastic, including the first visit I made when I became a member.  The staff work hard to ensure that the experience there is like no other.  I have been there twice when the power has been out and each time they handle it with grace and sincere earnestness to make sure my visit is just as good as if there was electricity.  I have recommended this winery to friends who have also become members.  This pandemic has not been an easy transition for anyone but I have to say that regardless of the operating conditions, Folded Hills strives to bring the A game!   And don't forget to visit the Farmstand across the way for produce, etc.!<//review>

I was lucky enough to be at Folded Hills this past weekend for opening day of their new Homestead Winery and Tasting Room. OMG what a cool place this is!! They took the original farmers house - where they used to make pre prohibition wine btw - and completely renovated it while somehow still letting the history of the place shine through. Wow! This place is seriously gorgeous. I had already been to their Montecito Tasting Room (also awesome) so I knew I loved all of the wines, but this place really blew me away. We meant to pop in for an hour or so, and ended up staying all day! Bring a picnic lunch...you won't want to leave. Lots of great areas to hang, inside and out, and enjoy a wine tasting...or in our case a few bottles...of their award winning Lilly Rosé and my favorite, August White! They also have backgammon...bocce ball...cornhole...and even yard farkle!! I'm in heaven. Whoever designed this place is a genius. Grab some bottles to go and don't forget a trucker hat! I've gotten asked like ten times already where I got it! I'll be back soon, I loved it all so much I joined the wine club! Can't wait for the private wine club party this fall!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</Text>

Love this place. You can come and feed goats and pigs. You can also buy their farm produce and more. Plenty of parking space. My husband and I used to come way before it was remoled and bought by a new family. I remember the farm cats that would hang around while you did your produce shopping. Sadly they retired and moved to Hawaii. A beautiful small relaxing place non the less. Worth paying a visit too. Great place to bring the little ones.< /Text>

With a number of fairly expensive homemade products.  On the upside they also feature a L2 EV charging point, though in all fairness maybe it should be labeled level 1.5 as its kinda slow.  still if in a pinch for a charge, pull in for a free charge and some homemade goodies.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbXcPR87kmur-eMxdRENWokrVj5APZ_h9-lHab=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1593447702911, 'text': 'Thank you for your review!'}</Resp><GmapID>0x80eeace4e923e1d1:0x1248a292e6f7d819</GmapID></record>

Love this Winery! Really a great place!  Tasting rooms are incredible as well as the wine.  Completely renovated farm house...beautiful. Plenty to do or just merely relax and enjoy!  5 Star!  Really enjoyed all the effort and thought that went into Folded Hills! Wonderful people there make much of the environment. Thank you!< /text>

All of the produce is organic. We go to pick strawberries and raspberries and then in the small store inside we pick up raw organic honey and local baked cookies.

Not only is there organically grown fresh produce, they also sell water and Lori's Original Lemonade as well as local honey and fresh eggs. And more! A litter of pigs, a couple of goats a cow and miniature donkey are out back for petting. When you are on the road and need a break, this is the place to stop. Friendly service. Love this place!< /Text>

Driving up from LA, we always make it a point to stop here. Unbelievably fresh vegetables and fruit. Compare the taste by purchasing the same items you buy here from your local market. Only then will you see the HUGE difference.  Also, the staff here could not be friendlier. I highly recommend this place.< /Text>

Organic vegetables and fuits, bit over priced. They also have cookies, honey and some snacks. Kinds enjoyed the goats and other animals in their backyard. Nice for a stop on long drive.<//Text>

<Review>President of the Elks Lodge “Al” is a Crook,if you participated in the super bowl pool at this place, you should call immediately and complain and get you money back because they scammed you out of you money they changed the payout rules to ensure that they keep your money , i called and complained and they are refunding my money cause they know they are in the  wrong , the president of the elks lodge "al" is nothing but a crook!!!!
Do not participate in any super bowl pools related to this place they only try to scam you out of your money, they change the rules of the payouts to make sure money stays with their own people, SCAM ALERT!!!!< /Review><Time>1517957040665</Time>< GmapID>

Guadalupe medical center is the best place I've been to. The staff is AMAZING from the time u walk through the door they make u feel like your part of their family. Dr.Baggot is the bomb he delivered my baby a month ago he is a great doctor very smart man. I love this place they have made my time here very special. Definitely recommend it if u are looking for great care.</text>

Today marks 7 days since my baby boy was delivered. Dr. Baggot and the ladies were amazing throughout my 1st pregnancy experience. All the appointment went smoothly every time.
I really appreciate everything they did and the treatment I received from Guadalupe Medical Center.
If God bless me with another chance of getting pregnant.  I'll look forward in returning to the clinic.
Thank You Dr. Baggot and Ladies, greatly appreciate it all 🙏🏻

The reason Im writing this review is because this sat so heavy on my heart and mind. Dr.Baggot is great at what he does, he just manages a lot of patients so he doesn't remember you by your own individual visits.  This made it kind of difficult to recieve adequate care.
Please, please, please be your biggest advocate. This was my first full term pregnancy, I learned so much and just wish I knew more becauseit would've prevented a lot of mistakes made by Dr. Baggot. I just wish hed stop for just a second and pay more attention and take his time with each patients.< /Review>< Response>

Don't get my rating wrong but I have a risky pregnancy and Doctor Baggott gave me the best care but I had to pay for progesterone to take care of my pregnancy. I had to look for a different Doctor who gave me progesterone shots for free. I loved this clinic and the staff. Dr. Baggott is great. The clinic is very clean neat and also you get an ultrasound and pics every time. But is hard to be paying for medicine when you can have it for free. But if it wasn't for this I would have loved to keep attending this clinic.< /review>

I recently had my baby 6 weeks ago and Dr. Baggot was my OB through my pregnancy. I had a very rough pregnancy from early on due to high blood pressure. And starting at 20 weeks I had appointments and ultrasounds weekly. My pregnancy wasnt expected to go longer than about 30ish weeks because of my preeclampsia. But with all the vitamins and supplements Dr. Baggot had me taking my pregnancy went all the way to 39 weeks when I had my 9lb baby girl! I also love the nurses at this clinic,  they're so sweet and were so good at answering any questions I had and seemed to truly care about me and my babies well being. Would definitely recommend to everyone!</text>

The best doctor u will ever find!! After I went in to early labor with my 1st son 7 months pregnant and loseing him I was only 18 years old. He told me if I get pregnant again to find him he promised me I would have my child. Will 10 years went by and I found myself pregnant and I hunted him down...lol found him and as scared as I was that I would lose this child like I did my last he insered me that I would be ok and with the med he put me on and the care I got from him and that staff I now have a 2 year old son. Not a day goes by that I was blessed to come across this man. P.s he don't know yet but I'll be seeing him soon. Lol< /Review>

I would never recommend this "DOCTOR" .. If you are looking for help, this is not the place instead of relieving yourself of your problems, you get worse and you will only give away your $ 100 dollars to tell you what you already know  NEVER RETURN ..< /Review>

Took my car here to get it ready for smog, mark made me feel like choice was a no brainer, he said the problem would get handled and it did. My 1998 Acura Rl has misfiring on the whole right side of the engine, took it to acouple shops to handle the cylinders and 1500 in nothing. I took it to gregs, and when it was released the misfiring was gone. My cars been running pretty smooth, and the best part about this place is marks customer service, and the mechanic. These guys are great, my cars are coming here now🙂</Text>

I went to Greg's Automotive to get an estimate for mechanical work that needed to be done on my car! Very friendly and I like the idea of my information was stored in to the system prior to me arriving so I didn't have to repeat everything of why I was there in the first place! They work on my car and gave me detail to detail of all my repairs that needed to be done! With no pressure to perform any repairs at their facility!< /text>

They had found the problem,  but it was going to be a couple hours before they could get the parts and fix it.  Gave me a ride home and called and came to get me when it was done.
I have used this shop for many years for both my Jeep and my daughters cars.  Always great service and never any problems.
I highly recommend them.

<review>I came back with my wife's F150 and my jeep. Both for brake inspections. Both needed front pads.... rotors turned (F150) & rotors replaced (Jeep). Both of the rear brakes had some life left. Work was done professionally and completed within a few hours. We'll be coming back and will be recommending to friends and family.</review>< Pictures>

I’ve been coming to Greg’s since 2009. I will continue to come here because finding a honest mechanic is not easy. Before I found Greg’s Automotive, it was always a nightmare at the stealerships. You know that game they always play ‘how much stuff can they find wrong with your car, then try 5 expensive things before they fixed the problem, and then you have to bring it back in a week’. Thats not the case with Greg’s. In 12 years I have never had to bring my vehicle back, they don’t play games. They fix the problem the first time. That’s hard to find. 10/10.< /Text>

Trust 'em...I do.  Exceptional, quick and fair service, plus they go the extra mile to please you.  I had a car that wouldn't pass smog from another shop...brought it here...it was fixed and passed smog the next day.  Great work on my old Jeep also...I think it runs better now than it ever did.<//Text>

After moving here roughly a year ago, I was incredibly nervous about finding an honest mechanic and through some recommendations, my fiance and I gave Greg's a shot. They don't try to sell you stuff you don't need, the prices are very reasonable, and the customer service is great! Mark is always a pleasure to talk to on the phone or in person and you can see they are very passionate about what they do. My Fiance and I always check with her dad who is also a mechanic back home just to make sure we are getting a fair price and Greg's is definitely giving very honest pricing and diagnoses. If you're looking for an honest shop with great customer service and repair times, this shop is absolutely worth giving a shot!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I took my car to Greg's while on vacation in San Diego and they were very quick to diagnose the problem. They understood that I needed to get back home asap and unfortunately as my luck has it the fix would not be a simple fix and would take 3-4 days to get the parts and rebuild. I understood the situation and although stressed because of my time constraints knew that they would have it fixed as soon as they possibly could. These guys were so great that even though they do not normally open on Saturdays, came in on Saturday to help expedite getting me back on the road. I got my car back and on the road a few days earlier than I could have had thy not gone the extra mile! As I have also had other work on others cars done here and have always been happy and impressed with their work and have also recommended them to all my friends and family, I would also recommend them to anyone looking for quality work. Thanks Greg, Mark and the whole staff. You guys are great!< /text>< Pictures>

Thank you for that. I am sorry for your unfortunate outcome."}< /Response>

This place does not honor your appointment. We have specifically scheduled for Thursday and when I get there on Thursday, I was told that it was the day before which was made up prob because 1. I'm a young lady 2. they're too full of other people.

Edit: thank you for applying my comment. First of all, I didn't not scheduled for Wednesday, period. I remember that. It was Thursday. When I came on Thursday, you said wrong day, you can do the next day that's why you set Friday. No other "accommodation". I cancelled that later on because I don't want to support business like yours and rather pay more to go somewhere closer. I do apologise I missed one before, but it was not both Monday and Tuesday. Just one appointment and I apologised in the phone. Make stories and blame on customers is not the way to do business.<//review>

<review>I received wonderful customer service on both of my visits to this location.  Lawrence W. was very professional while helping me choose the right phone for my needs and was very knowledgeable on the products. Drake J. was also knowledgeable and very professional. He answers all of my questions and took the time to help me understand my new phone and helped me set up my new phone. I really appreciate the time he took to help me with my previous phone. Thank you both for being professional, helpful and for making my experience positive. It was refreshing to have a positive and wonderful customer service experience.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1618955788051, 'text': 'Hello Elisa Martin  Our number one goal is to provide you with an exceptional customer experience.

I've been to this store three times and it's been a roller coaster ride.  I went in to trade my phone with Royce and he's a really nice guy.  He said that my phone met all the criteria for trade in.  I waited for the new phone to come in before going to bring my old phone in.  When I brought it in, I'm told by Vinny that my old phone doesn't meet the criteria and I'll need to replace the screen of the phone, which was not told to me on my first visit.  At this point, my original phone has been factory reset and I'm using the new phone, so I have to shell out nearly $200 to replace the screen.  I go to bring in the old phone after this and I'm told that since I had originally asked for it to be sent back in via the mail, I can't bring the old phone into the store, which I was never told on my second visit, even though I had told Vinny I had originally asked for it to be shipped.  He made constant reassurances that I could bring it back to the store.  If I had mailed the phone after I had met with Royce, I'm sure I would have gotten nearly nothing for the phone, since it didn't qualify for the promotion, but I had no way to know this.  Working with Vinny was quite challenging.  I never felt welcome and he would continue to give me inaccurate information on both what the phone is worth and what can or can't be fixed on the phone.  I won't be coming back to this location, even if I have problems with the new phone.  I can't trust a word that comes out of their mouths because they were constantly wrong and I'm now hoping the phone makes it in the mail and it doesn't have any other problems that they forgot to mention.  Avoid if you can.<//Text>

What an amazing experience with my mom.  They helped us upgrade her phone, switch everything over but went above and beyond with some extra details.  They were patient and kind and made the experience seamless.   I highly recommend this location as not all locations are the same in this area. Our rep was Lawrence Williams.  He was so patient and kind with my mom.  Highly recommend you ask for this young man if you need to head to the location in Goleta.</review>

<text>So I was doing a trade in of my iphone 6s for a 12 mini. They didn't have the color I wanted so I asked for it to be shipped but for some reason this location said that it doesn't normally have phones shipped to their location ( I think this is weird). I have a PO box so they said they couldn't ship it to me in Santa Barbara, but Royce who was helping me at the time apparently got an exception made for me, which I thought was lovely, and was extremely grateful. BUT, right after he told me he would make an exception for me Royce basically said I HAD to write a google review for him because he was doing me a 'favor.' His words verbatim "you don't have to but you kinda have to." I am a student and I felt like he was taking advantage of me because there was literally nothing I could do to get my phone unless it was shipped to this store. I DO NOT like being coerced into writing good reviews for a service I feel should be provided since my family has been with ATT for over 15 years.

When I went back into the store though I had a different associate named Diana help me and she was absolutely amazing. I didn't feel like she was trying to take advantage of me and would highly recommend getting help from her.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1622754985844, 'text': 'Thank you for the review!!'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Royce was very helpful, patient, and informative.  Even though I had a difficult time purchasing my iPhone mini online, he listened to my issues and provided good suggestions for solutions.  He also helped me find the best phone plan for my family at the best rate. He is a great example of providing world class customer service</Review>

<Review>Royce was very helpful, patient, and informative.  Even though I had a difficult time purchasing my iPhone mini online, he listened to my issues and provided good suggestions for solutions.  He also helped me find the best phone plan for my family at the best rate. He is a great example of providing world class customer service</Review><gmap_id>0x80e940ae1dc34af9:0xdb9c8bfb3a8da7ac<//gmap_id><pics>None</pics>< time>

Royce was awesome! He helped my wife and I get a new phone and set up a new number and plan that we felt confident about. No BS here. He was honest and really worked with our budget.</Review>

Lawrence saved me from a locked out phone. I had a useless, locked out phone and he got me in to delete the fingerprint which was not operating correctly. I now have my phone back with NO fingerprint. I highly recommend Lawrence. He's kind & knowledgeable.< /Review>

Do not go here if you need customer service, there is none. The guy here said he literally cannot help us with anything relating to billing or the account. He did not have any numbers to even call for AT&T customer-no-service. Do not ever use this company even if it's your last choice on earth. Don't expect to ever be able to go into the store to do anything expect set up an account or pay. Literally anything else will redirect you to a 3 hour phone queue.<//review>

Royce was super helpful getting a phone unlocked for me even though I was doing so to take it to another carrier. He was respectful of me wanting to keep my carrier too which I totally appreciate. Based on the customer service I received today, I would not be averse to using AT&T in the future.</text>

Went to upgrade my phone but we didn't have an appointment,  but Lawernce offered to help us since their 6pm had not shown up yet.  He was great! Answered all our questions,  he was the best!! We left there with a new phone, fun accessory and big smiles on our faces.  Lawernce deserves a bonus!!</text>

<Review>Their AT&T Team is super helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. My sales associate explained my plan thoroughly and told me I had features like HBO Max, which I had not been using.

Furthermore, I was educated on how my upgrade would work out (circa 6 months from now).

Thank You 🙏🏼 for such amazing 🤩 customer service.<//Review><rating>5<//rating><UserId.>116689411191169179709<//UserId.>< user_name>

I had a really Pleasant experience  working with Aida. I  had came in looking for new service and I got a new 12 with an unlimited plan. She really knows her stuff and was so patient. I’m surprised and grateful that she took our time with us explaining and making sure we got the best possible program. There was a lot of people waiting in line but she was vary attentive to us and answered all of her questions. Amazing!< /Review>

If you need any assistance in any AT&T service, phone upgrades or AT&T TV he is there to assist and make you feel comfortable along the entire process.

<Text>I was anxious about coming in and turning in my old phones/upgrading to the new ones because I knew it could be a pain/take awhile. But Diana was awesome and made it such a smooth process. She walked me through everything and calmed my nerves about price and helped me with a breakdown of my bill and everything I’d be saving. Super appreciative of Diana’s time and attention today! I will definitely be coming to this location any time I need to go into an AT&T store again.</Text>< pics>

He was friendly and personable and helped us through some really complicated changes without rushing or confusing us. It was a long wait as well even though we had a appointment because it was a busy day, and he was accommodating and efficient. There was another customer who was upset by the wait time and was very rude to us, and was making us feel Uncomfortable, and he spoke to her and asked her to please stop. We really appreciated his attentiveness and dedication to good service and helping us with everything we needed. Never had a better experience at AT&T!<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

My experience was so grate! My husband had to come in to fix his number transfer and I decided to come along to get a new phone. Aida was so amazing she found out that I was paying way to much and ended up switching to first Net service  and getting a phone and free watch and a ipad. Aida Took such good care of us Never had an experience like that before at At&t.< /review>

Drake was super helpful setting up my partners and my new phones - I really appreciated how upbeat he was and he worked hard to help us get the best deal possible (he even went to go find us outside to double check on things while we were waiting)! We really appreciated the help and Drake is definitely a go-to employee there for whatever you need!</review>

<Text>I was extremely disappointed with AT&T service, coverage, and professionalism. I went to AT&T signed up five lines for my business was helped by Courtney. Courtney had given me a price with some promotions. My first two months because of the promotions should’ve  been free. Got a bill in the $400 range the first month. Went and talk to Courtney she said she would fix that  and the next two months would be free I just had to sign up for automatic pay. The next month automatically my account was deducted close to $400 again. Keep in mind my bill should’ve been a little over 200. Called Store Courtney no longer work there and was held by the manager Eric. Eric said he would look into it call me back.I can go on and on about my experience but the short story is five months later I’m paying double what I was quoted in the store. The promotional gift cards they said they would be sending me never showed up. My coverage is awful in Santa Barbara where I live. No one from the store calls me back when they say they will and nothing promised ever came through. I am switching my carriers. I will never come back to ATT. Externally disappointed and wasted so much time coming into the store and over the phone.  Do not trust this store or their employees! I will be complaint all the way up the ranks! I’ve never complained about a business before either but I’ve paid in five months close to 1000 over what I was supposed to pay.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Miguel was the best service I’ve had, I switched over from T Mobile and it’s been great since the start! He’s got my back every time I’m in and he sets the bar above most, hope anyone who goes in gets him! He just gets it done and is honest and spells it all out for you during the transaction. Great service and carrier!</Review>

<Review>Came out to the AT&T at Camino. Drake came through hooking us with some iPhone 11s. He took the time to break down the promos. Helped us to find the best deal possible for our new phones.

<text>Miguel was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about all the AT&T services. He was patience and took the time to hear our needs. We were extremely happy to have had him as our Sales rep. I would definitely recommend anyone I know to go in and talk to him for any of their wireless needs.< /text>< Rate>

Visited to get a nighthawk WiFi hot spot. Lawrence helped us and I’m so glad he did. He knows what he’s talking about, cares about your experience and needs, and has pleasant energy :) Very straight forward service, we were in and out of there in no time but all of our problems were solved. Thank you ATT team!!</Text>

Came into AT&T today to get a new iPhone. Drake assisted us in our purchase. He informed us of the new AT&T TV plan and also helped us navigate through the entire process. Drake is very knowledgeable and can answer lots of questions.
Thank you Drake!!</text>

<Review>Drake helped me out with switching services to theirs and was so patient with me trying retrieve the necessary information from my previous carrier so I could be able to switch. He described in depth my perks regarding my new service with AT&T and also helped me get setup with a new cell device. Very knowledgeable, and kind service overall.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Drake was astonishingly helpful.  I mean astonishingly.  After 20 years with AT&T wireless, I was ready to cancel my account out frustration. I stopped in to the Goleta store today and Drake fixes it all — and more.  He is an excellent listener, understood everything quickly, and worked quickly to get me back up and running!< /Review>

Went in to add some phones for the kids on my plan. I was helped by Courtney and she did a great job of showing me an optimized plan that saved me some significant $$. Had an issue eventually with an old # that didn't get closed out that resulted in what I thought was erroneous billing, and we called AT&T for help. Went back in to this location instead and Aida totally took charge and got everything cleared up within 20 minutes!  Cannot give enough stars to this spot, and I will be keeping my business there!<//Review>

Vinny waited for us to arrive to purchase the iPhone 2020 SE because the other store were out of stock.  We got a few minutes before closing and he was very patient to set up new phone & link my old info to it.< /review>

Mr. Lawrence, a great employee there! He is from N. York and moved to California relatively recently. Your business company has a blessing having him on board. He did everything in a smooth, nice and respectful way. Simple: 1st at all he’s a human being and a great guy with 24 y/o only! Congratulations Lawrence! Just for this, you deserve a raise or at least a reward ASAP!<//Review>

I recently went to the Goleta location and was assisted by Drake, he went above and beyond to help me and my mom activate an account and transfer all of our devices in the easiest way possible. I would highly suggest going to this location, Drake and his entire team will go to great lengths to help with any needs you may have .<//text>

After 7 phone calls with AT&T, we had little confidence that an in person visit would solve our problem. However,  we were very pleasantly surprised thanks to Aida's knowledge, initiative and professionalism. She solved our issue, gave us good information and showed us how to avoid the same problem in the future. We highly recommend visiting the Goleta store. Ask for Aida!<//text>

I didn't know that this location had temporarily closed due to Covid 19. I'm so grateful that they're open and have a very helpful staff! I was able to get the phone my daughter wanted for her birthday.  They also helped me schedule services for my property in a different location. Very helpful staff.</review></record>

He didn't introduce himeself and completely shut me down without even exploring options to my account asking me to come back tomorrow. I called the customer service line and they explained the service I was asking for could've been done instores. The guy was just being a jerk.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Visited the AT&T store in Goleta to sign up for FirstNet. Drake was extremely helpful and patient as he walked me through the process to get set up with FirstNet. Excellent customer service, will certainly be recommending to my coworkers!< /review>

Horrible attendance by the staff, walked in no one greeted us or wrote our name down on the waiting listed, waited 30 minutes for nothing . They helped another customer who was there after us and ignored us !! DEFINITELY NOT GOING BACK THERE HORRIBLE SERVICE<//Text>

Went to purchase a phone outright ( and unlock it) on our AT&T family plan, as a sibling needed a new phone before a trip to europe. Management flat out refused to sell us a device without signing up some sort of payment plan, indicating it was store policy. Told us to go to best buy instead. Called AT&T support where a representative told me no such policy is in place. Also was told they were probably trying to make commission and the only recourse was to visit a different store...It's clear where their priorities lie. Avoid this AT&T store.<//text>

<Text>At&t is able to engage in implicit theft via their associated business, directvnow:

If I could give 0 stars, I would. I opened a phone service with at&t back in March 2018, and I unknowingly got some kind of "free trial" with directvnow with it. I had no idea this was signed up under my name, that my bank information was given over to directvnow, and that I would be charged $35 - $40 every month after. I never used this service-- I never even knew how to while I had this account.

It was only after I closed my at&t account (for unrelated reasons) that I finally realized the directvnow charge was actually instigated by at&t. Somehow directvnow cannot locate any account with my information because is now closed-- and yet THEY STILL HAVE MY BANK INFORMATION and I'm STILL BEING CHARGED EVERY MONTH.

After changing my bank card three times-- STILL being charged from directvnow-- I actually have to close my bank account essentially because of unagreed terms and withheld explicit information on the part of at&t.

Essentially, at&t / directvnow stole from me, via bureaucratic technicalities. Seriously, how do you have my bank information for a monthly bill, and yet you cannot locate my account to cancel?

If you are with at&t or signing up, I strongly advise you look at their fine print agreements and your information they share with directvnow. Otherwise you may find yourself under theft every month, and having to close your bank account.<//Text>< pictures>
