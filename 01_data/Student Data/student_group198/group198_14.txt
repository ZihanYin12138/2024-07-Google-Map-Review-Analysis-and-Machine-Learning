A lot of the furniture is broken and still being sold with only a 10% discount which is kind of a bummer. Feels like you could do better at a yard sale. The employees are always nice though.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

One of the best discount stores to find multiples of particular items for example if you want to matching lamps to flank something, you can find him here. Same with the TJ Maxx that's nearby</review>

<review>Home goods is shopping therapy. I could walk through the store for hours, so when I want to relax, I just grab a cart and shop for office supplies. I love their stationary, the coffee mugs (I found a Harry Potter Marauder's Map mug here), and the ceramic seasonal collections are my favorite areas. They also have good dog toys, and I bought a rubbery ball that has treats inside that keep my border collie Mix busy trying to get the treats out. This one is just has just enough squishiness, and the faceted outside makes it easy to pick up. Great store with great products! I'm adding some Halloween decorations that I just saw. Home Goods always has a great supply.</review><user_id>110950318985817456814</user_id>< Gmap_id>

Called 7 stores looking for a desk.  Found it in Santa Clarita. Drove there from Thousand Oaks to purchase and discovered missing pieces when we got back home. Store clerk said he noticed missing pieces but didnt say anything!  Found a replacement in Fremont CA but they wouldnt honor discount coupon from original purchase.  Very disappointing customer service.<//text>

<Review>I hadn't been to Home Goods for a couple of years. I expected to see changes. However, nothing has changed. The volume of customers has dropped a little, at least in the physical store. But they still offer good stuff at good prices. And even though I don't recognize any of the staff, everyone is still helpful & friendly. I plan to visit again, soon, (in a month or so) this time.<//Review>< pics>

staff was horrible and rude.They wouldn’t let me purchase a chair that was placed on hold by someone else until 3:00 and i went to purchase the chair at 3:45.The staff said it was okay to purchase until a different old staff worker came by rudely and said i was unable to purchase the chair even though the time was acceptable for me to buy.<//text>

When I go there they large carts with merchandise on them all over the place making it very hard  to move around and shop conveniently without bumping into something or one of the RUDE employees on the floor. They are only hypocritical nice when they are at the register and is probably because they are being watched. I know for a fact that it changed management and I honestly thought it would become better but it didn’t. Simi Valley store is so clean and organized I just wish it was not far from me and  I had an incident that  happened a couple of weeks ago with some merchandise that I purchased and was giving out to a person without me calling them to release it to this person and they only went by a picture that this guy had on his phone and released the piece of furniture without contacting me to double check if I had sent that person to pick up . Long  story short the person never delivered my piece of furniture that I purchased for $300 so I lost all the way around because management was not helpful or sympathetic to my loss! Their policy is not the best when it comes to this matter so be very careful.< /Review><UserId.>109418140136244141622<//UserId.><Resp>None</Resp>< date>

No my kind of place so let me channel my wife........... Awesome. Love going down every isle and looking at everything. The prices are great and you can always find a bargain.

The parking is a bit of a nightmare here so be patient, and watch other drivers and it gets packed.<//text>

Great finds. The shopping center has plenty of parking. The store has so much stuff you could spend hours in here. The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 was the cashier. She was not friendly. I'm big on customer service. It can make or break a business. Sad such a lovely store has rude worker's.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Great place for brand name, 1/2 priced, cooking and baking tools and utensils. You have to hunt for what your looking for, but most likely it's there.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<review>All I can say is WOW!
Furnishing my place at a discounted rate has never been easier. I practically love every piece in there.

The employees are very helpful and courteous, the manager helped put the desk I purchased in my car. I am very impressed with the inventory and how clean the shelves are.

Be sure you stop by here before purchasing furniture, curtains, and home accessories!<//review><rate>5</rate>< pictures>

Huge store, and well stocked in every department I looked in (bedding, pillows, dishes, wall decor and rugs).  The dishes are organized by color, which is a nice display.  Most things are on the pricey side compared to stores like Ross and Marshalls, which often carry the exact same things and brands, but obviously at much lower prices.  However, they do have some deals - we saw a very large, gilded mirror for $10!  Overall, they have tons of products but the prices are hit and miss.< /Text>

Not great when the staff accuse you of switching the price tags.. I just thought I had found a bargain! (That's kind of the purpose of this store) and you should've just honoured it instead of making it a thing. Other than that the selection isn't great and it's pretty pricey for the junk that most of it is. FOR THE JOBSWORTH THAT SHE WAS THE B*TCH WAS FINE TO OVERCHARGE FOR OTHER ITEMS... PROBABLY WOULD'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF SWITCHING THE TAGS ANYWAY IT WORKS BOTH WAYS.... DUH! ITS CALLED PRINCIPLE!!!!!!!!!<//Text>

This is good spot. The workers are very friendly and do a great job on your nails. As time passes the place is growing and expanding. They make sure all of their customers are comfortable and satisfied with the work that was done.<//text>

<review>I came here based on the reviews and they were so accurate. I haven't had attention to detail and such care in years. I will definitely be a long term customer. I do appreciate that I made an appointment as it was busy and steady the whole time. What a great find!!< /review></record>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>Its a nice place but i went in for a full set and to get my lip waxed. They did my eyebrows when i said i only wanted my lip. They still didn't listen. I got my full set which I'm pretty happy about but the lady who did my nails messed up my cuticle to the point it started bleeding, told her and she apologized. I wanted a discount for that incident but they still charged me full price. I wouldnt come here again or recommend this place.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Excellent Safety Protocols and Service!
I was very nervous about getting anything done during the Covid-19 pandemic and finally ventured out yesterday.
I was incredibly impressed with how serious and incredibly thorough the owners are with their safety protocols to keep their staff and patrons safe!
Thorough cleaning and wiping, hand sanitizing plus solid communication in advance about safety measures,  Thank you so much!</Review>< pictures>

<text>I like it here for the pedis and the eyebrow waxing, super affordable, and yet still great work! Heather is my go-to lady if you want things always done right! Only issue is sometimes they only want to take cash, though I have paid with cards before, seems to be a toss up depending on when you go.<//text>< Pics>

<review>My friend and I went the other day we both got a pedicure and our nails done her pedicure was fine but I ended up getting  a guy that was very rude and ended up hurting both of my toes while he was cleaning them.

Not that but after I had said I didn't want an acrylic set the lady that was doing my friends set was very pushy for me to get a set done and ended up messing up my friends nails. To top it of the lady that did her nails ended up cutting her more than once.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Time>1616848261003</Time>< Rate>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I'd been bouncing around to different nail salons for years trying to find my favorite place. This is it! The employees always do a great job and are friendly. They have a lot of pedicure options and prices are pretty similar to other places in town I think. They also are pretty hygienic from what I've seen. I always make an appointment, but I see people walk in often and not have to wait too long even though it's a small place with only a few people working. This is my new go-to spot!< /review>< pics>

A another one of the gals i like to see. I love that they started showing movies during the day. It's nice to have something to watch in between conversations and helps pass the time :) I love their drink selection and happy hour too. Great service and a great atmosphere.

Fantastic experience! This was my first time and I will definitely be returning. Convenient location, easy online booking and great customer service. I was seen right on time for a gel pedicure and polish removal and they look great! This will be my new go-to spot and can't to try out more services.</Review>

Best place in the whole city.
Without a doubt this is the cleanest neatest nail salon in Oxnard, the owner is very personable and remembers the names of everyone walking in the door, the service is amazing and the prices are the best around, I've been going since they opened  and the quality and cleanliness is still there. They are terrific and deserve nothing but 5 stars ++++++.
I'm so glad I found them and I will never go anywhere else. I typically go with a group of friends and we are treated like royalty.< /review>

Great laughs with the staff but not so great nails.  I went in for a full set of pink and white.  I got a cut cuticle, pink bleeds onto white, glue on my fingers and gel top coat is bubbling.  I don't want the headache of going in to request it be fixed.</review>

This was my first pedicure since arriving in Oxnard and I am always nervous about trying new places but I am glad I went here. My technician did a great job and was very easy to talk to. The place and instruments were clean and I felt the prices were reasonable! There was a ton of staff making walk-ins easy.</text>

My experience was top notch. They really focus on customer service and make sure you are having a good experience. The place inside is neat, modern, and clean. My nail technician was great! She did my nails exactly how I wanted them and did not dig into my nail bed to do a full set of acrylics. I will definitely go back again!</review>

I love this place! I went in for a full set and the woman who did my nails was very nice and friendly. She took her time, we had a great conversation, and she made sure I loved my nails before I left. It was wonderful! I will definitely be back.</review>

I love coming here for gel manicures. They have great color selections, the salon is clean and the techs are all very friendly. I've had appointments and I've also come in on a whim and they accommodated despite being busy.< /Review>

<Review>There's a reason Le's Nails II has a 5 star review. I visited Le's Nails II for the first time this weekend, but it will not be my last! I got a gel manicure and spa pedicure, and my nails look great! I was impressed at how the owner helped me pick out a pedicure color that matched the red OPI gel I chose for my manicure. Customer service is top notch. Both ladies were professional, friendly and knowledgeable. They really made sure I was comfortable and asked questions so I got the look I wanted. Compared to other nail salons I've visited in Oxnard, this place is by far the best. Awesome. Can't wait to go back!</Review><Date>1557959707460< /Date><gmapID>0x80e84c15b0988931:0x4b8e508805756bae< /gmapID><pics>None<//pics>< response>

So I'm used to walk-in locations, I rarely make appointments for nail. This was an experience and I'm glad we did it. We came for my daughter's 19th bday. Her tech on both hands and feet were awesome. I really appreciated her , care, and service. I will be back for my nails.... The ladies here rock, and so did my mimosa***</text>

I remember going in once because I wanted to get my nails done for my niece’s baptism and when I went a friendly lady attended me and my mom so gratefully. They offered us water, they wanted us to look comfortable. When I was getting gel, the lady was talking to me about her life and we were talking back and forth, we had a friendly talk. They charged me a fair price, they did everything, I got my toes done and everything. They gave me a a massage and a foot rub. I wanna go back again! ☺️☺️<//text>

Jenny is A M A Z I N G! I have now been to this salon twice and I've found my nail tech in Le's Nails II. She's sooo sweet and takes her time to ensure you are happy. The first time I received a full set and of course I wanted the most done to my nails but she was patient and I appreciate her sooo much. I will be back for my next set in a few weeks and her work last a long time and I could've easily waited another week and the nails wouldve lasted. Run don't walk to see her!!!! I'm one happy customer.</review>

A few months ago I went to get a gel manicure and Darryl attended me. He left my cuticle area with cuts and when i left there were still bleeding! And to make the situation any worse he charged me $50 for a non professional gel manicure! very disappointed in this nail salon, my mom would always go here but after she saw how they left my fingers we never returned:(<//Review>

<review>Le's Nails II sets itself apart from other nail salons in Oxnard with its willingness to create trendy, bespoke nail designs. The first time that I went to Le's Nails II, I arrived about an hour before closing. Yet, the stylist and manager did not seem the least bit bothered by my holding them out late and apologized several times that it was taking so long. When my nails were done, I asked the manager if she would take some pictures with my phone. Not only did she agree with glee, but she whipped out a faux fur cloth for me to use a as a backdrop. Since my first time, I have returned and brought photos that I found online as examples of styles that I wanted. The stylists are always enthusiastic about endeavoring to re-create the styles from the photos. The worst thing about this place is that, once confronted with all the design options, you will have a hard time choosing one.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I wish half a star was a option on here. I've been to this location twice now & you'd think I'd learn the first time but I thought let's just give them another shot. Big mistake. First time I went my nails weren't even, a bubble was left on my nail, & a small strand of hair. I told the nail artist multiple times to fix it & she just ignored me & kept saying "don't worry". The second time I went I had to tell the lady (same lady) about 5 times to fix something & she kept insisting she was going to but if I hadn't said something I'm certain she would've left it. She left so much residue on the fingers & did a terrible job overall. It was only the second day after I got them done & a nail came off in my sleep...I went elsewhere to get them fixed & the other salon I went to commented on how terrible they were. Honestly don't waste your money here I've already done it twice. LESSON LEARNED.</Review>

<text>This place is beautiful, new, and clean. They have a wide selection of colors--regular, gel, and dip powder. All of their technicians are skillful, friendly, and attentive. The price is right, and if you ask for wine, it's all yours.< /text>< Pics>

My pedicure was okay. My friend's acrylic nails were uneven and crooked! And the manager was the one who did it. She took them off the same day.< /review>

The color is beautifully opaque (several techs have over filed/buffed so I've ended up with bald color spots), the acrylic isn't so thick that I feel like I have clay on my nails (a repeated issue in my dip try-outs), and the round shape is perfect...not to bash others, but many techs in my experience struggle to get a good round, and consistent shape on all ten fingers< /text>

I had a very bad chip on my thumbnail from an accident and the lady who helped me out did a great job patching it up! She carefully applied glue on my chipped nail and after the gel nail polish set in, it was seemless! Can't beat the price and service!<//Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Please do not go here. Consider this a warning. Read reviews....I thought, oh this place has been here forever, it's a chain, it must be good...NO.

Jimy speaks no English. He cut me almost immediately, and as I was saying "ow stop" kept cutting!

They did not seem to care AT ALL- and, after reading others experiences it's easy to see why, it happens often. The tools looked rusted....the nail clippers were awful. I couldnt communicate this with them because they either pretended not to, or didnt speak any English.

Then, the rest of the time he kept picking at the same toe!

The water was cold the entire time. Again. I couldnt get hot water because I just got a smile and a chuckle.

I brought my own polish which really confused Jimy. It was an ordeal to get my color and my clear sparkle top coat. At the end he put my polish away on their rack, then couldn't find it.....and gave me 2 $5 Bill's for change....NEVER coming back.

I get 1 pedicure every few months and this was torture, not a treat.</Text><user_name>Jenna Wood<//user_name>< Response>

Too expensive and the nails are not good quality. We asked for the price of some nails and they were charging $80 when in Nail Polish Bar in the Collection they charge $40 to $45 for that length and thick acrylic nails with long length.< /Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I usually go to Julie's Hair and Nails in Oxnard to get my nails done by Jen, but our schedules weren't matching up and I needed a fill asap. Went into Le's and was immediately taken in for a pedicure and fill. An older man worked on my hands while I got my pedicure. More than once he tore up my cuticle to the point where I was bleeding. He was very rough and didn't seem to get the point that he was hurting my nails. The shape of my nails needed to be redone twice and it still wasn't great but whatever, nothing's perfect. Left semi satisfied (mostly just needed to head to work). Not even six days later and multiple nails are lifting off, my gel is peeling and the my cuticles are still sore to the touch. When I called to ask to get them fixed the woman was beyond rude and hung up on me. Needless to say I will NEVER cheat on my nail tech again with some sub par nail salon.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80e84c15b0988931:0x4b8e508805756bae</gmap_id></record>

Arrive at 7:15pm with My Daughter waited and waited until 830pm they closed their doors.

At the end they didn't do her nails as they were fighting over who's going to do her nails.

Never coming back to this place again!!!!<//Review>

I won’t be coming back here again. Online and on their window it states they’re open at 9am. I called the Saviers location once it was 910 and asked if anyone was coming in, the man I spoke with said they opened until 930, so I waited. 940 and still nothing, so I decide to call the Saviers location once more. What irritated me the most was that this time he switched it around and said they didn’t open until 10. What a lack of professionalism and lack of respect for people’s time. I could’ve gone elsewhere if only this guy would’ve been honest from the begining.<//Review>

They all speak terrible about the customers. They did not know that I speak the language and I was shocked. I saw respectful regular customers being spoke to very rudely but were completely unaware.
Natalie in particular was very outspoken and vicious. She remarked how she enjoyed bringing pain to these rich Americans.
I thought the days were far behind us where such prejudice existed.
Never will I return here !</review>

Horrible place first time I did my nail with them I was unsatisfied with the service they gave. But  despite that I decided to give them a second chance and the experience was the same nails were trash and they don't stay  consistent with their pricing they charged me one price and they charged my sister another for the same nails.

they did the worst job on my nails they’re all crooked the nail tech slapped my hand and told me to stop complaining after i told him it was crooked they were stingy with the nail polish it isn’t painted correctly and the nail tech didnt check if they matched he made all my fingers bleed and didn’t even do a good job $50 down the drain</review>

<text>Me and my mom were sitting there for an appointment. My mom wanted a women to do our nails but there was someone already in the chair. She said 30 minutes wait and you'll be next after an hour.Another lady comes so she said she had an appointment which we did to.
The nail lady takes her and we have been there for an hour so the lady says it ok you can take them but she proceeds to take the other women. The other guy was giving us a dirty looks.I am so disgusted of the way they treated us . They were so mean and unkind and for sure will never go back there again.< /text>< pictures>

Getting my toes done and Joann has a terrible attitude. No thanks. Then they have the nerve to charge an extra $2 for using a credit card. And my toes look like i did them myself. Ha. 🙅🏽‍♀️<//Text>

It was fine, but it was one of those nail salons that just try to get a many people in as possible so it doesn't feel like they are really spending time with you...I also think their color selection should actually be better too.
Also also, we were asked to walk to gas station to get get cash since their card reader was down...not very convenient and not accessible.

< Review>
I got a fill for pink and white and my daughter brought in for her mani pedi. The place is really pretty and the chair they have for your child is a very cute butterfly. The service is great, only been here a couple times but I think this is going to be my go to after searching for a place for almost 2 years. They also do waxes and facials, I have to try it. My favorite is they are gentle with my nails but thorough, they take their time so long as you’re not in a rush.<//Review>

When the lady was doing my nails she would randomly leave in the middle of doing them and go eat. She also hurt me when she was filing my nails. They where also super chunky. On top of that it was $45 for plain white acrylics.<//Review>

I went here with my family while on a visit. We were pressed for time but they got us right in, given it was a Monday morning so the peak times may be different. I got the dip powder manicure and others got manis and pedis. We all like how our services turned out. The prefixes were better than what I pay at home. The shop was nice but not pretentious and the chairs were comfortable. We’ll be back on our other visits.< /Text>

I was going to this Salon for about two years, I had recommended friends and family. I love the location and the salon itself but the customer service and nail work are mediocre at best. They do basic nails, they don’t keep up with nail trends, every nail tech is always rushing and shape terribly. My biggest complaint is their time management, they are more concerned with money then providing quality work to each customer. Even if you make an appointment expect to be seen 30 minutes after. My last experience here brought me to tears, I came in to fix ONE broken nail,  I made an appointment but still decided to arrive earlier, considering that getting my one nail done shouldn’t take that long. I waited 2hours for help, my appointment time came and passed and I had about enough. I spoke up and asked when I will be helped since I’d been waiting for so long then Susan very angrily came to me and started filling my nail so hard she made cuticle bleed, she made the nail shorter than the rest of the set, but by this point I just wanted to leave. So if you don’t mind waisting hours of your day continue going here but other than that there are
plenty other salons in the area that take their time and pride themselves in their work.< /text>

This place is horrible. I went there with my granddaughter and daughter in law for mani-pedis. It was my first and last visit. The place was congested and disorganized with few places to sit or stand while waiting. The polishes were poorly maintained, jars were caked with very little polish. The whole place had a funky, not very clean atmosphere. We chose our polish colors but the place was crowded with no place to sit. We decided to leave as we were feeling uncomfortable and it looked like a long wait. We got to the car and a woman from the salon chased after us. She said they were almost done with the current customers and we’d have a ten minute wait at most. We felt pressured and awkward and went back in. They sent us to pedicure chairs and put our feet in water. We sat there ignored for a full hour. Finally we put our shoes back on and left. What started as a fun family outing was turned in to an unpleasant and very rude waste of time. There was no justification for taking advantage of us, lying to us. This salon is not at all attractive or clean but it’s the terrible service that is most notable. I would not recommend this place at all.<//Text>

I've been searching for a good nail salon for almost a year and finally found it! The color selection is huge, the menu is clear and states all of their (very fair) prices, and the manicurists have all been kind and friendly both times I've been there. I don't do anything crazy, but I did finally find a dark enough red and I've heard they are amazing with the wild stuff too. I won't go to another nail salon in Monterey area again!</review>

It was a Tuesday and crowded. I started to leave but the lady said they could take me. I got a guy who rushed through my pedicure and acrylic fill. Seemed like he was trying to hurry so he could take care of other customers rather than do quality work. His foot massage game was bad as well. Not coming back.<//Review>

John, his wife Susan, and their staff are so sufficient. Great place to get your gel nails and pedicures. They also offer waxing. Has 7 new pedicure chairs and a child's pedicure chair. Thank you John.
Be patient ladies and gentlemen, it gets busy at times...it's well worth the wait.
They get new colors all the time.< /text>

I LOVE this place!  mani-pedis are the best and waxing is easy and painless.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and enjoyable.  Price is competitive with other salons and my gel manicure lasts 3 weeks.  Won't go anywhere else!</review>

Maybe I didn’t understand how this place was supposed to work, but I made a mani/pedi appointment yesterday morning for myself and another girl. We showed up 5 minutes before our appointment time. We were led to pedicure chairs, the water was turned on, and we were promptly forgotten about. There was no, “We’ll be with you in just a minute,” no explanation as to why we then waited 45 minutes after being sat down.

When one person finally came over, she didn’t introduce herself. She just sat down and asked what color my friend wanted. When my friend asked for stripes, she said she couldn’t do stripes, that she could only do one color. That morning when I made the appointment, I was assured they could do pretty much any design we wanted. At that point, we got up and left. No one was communicative with us. We sat and sat and sat while they took other customers and the fingernail tables.

Very disappointing as we’d heard only good things about this place.< /Text>

The best nail salon in Monterey area. They do a great job. Nails always last and they have great colors! I always get compliments with my nails. See Susan or Linda.< /Review>

Time is Money
Today was the second time John at Angel Nails was late for my appointment -- 15 mins today after the shop owner called him (he was at the bank and not aware of the appt though I saw it written on the schedule book), and 40 mins the time before, again with someone needing to call him. After speaking with John, there seems to be a disconnect with appt info being relayed to him though he did cite all other appointment times he has today without looking at the schedule. In both instances, I feel a phone call to me explaining that he was running late would of been appropriate as then I could have made a decision to reschedule or cancel. This is a standard practice of many professional services groups as they respect their clients' or customers' time. I respect their time, too, by arriving early or on time. In speaking with the shop owner, she seemed to not really care or even appreciate that I was trying to help bring the disconnect to light so that it could be addressed. Because of her attitude and lack of apology, I won't be going back.</Text>

<review>The food was good and there happy hour is the best. I mean who can beat buy one get one for a penny, right. The service could definitely get better. It isn't horrible but it doesn't stand out it's even slow. I've come back but the service still hasn't gotten better not a big thing however I think it's definitely something they need to improve before they start loosing business.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I have always loved this place but they really stepped up during the pandemic. I'm so happy they're weathering it and we can still go out for a lovely dinner and yummy drinks. They even provide water for my doggie who loves to stop in for a drink after his walk. ;)</Text>< time>

Reasonable price with much better than average bar food. And tons of selections. Tons of tvs everywhere and a big projector. Nice staff. There’s lots of parking in the back.
And there’s a secret bar/speakeasy. Find it!!

I think they have a recently new management so the food is much better than before if you haven’t been here in a while.< /Text>

<review>Food was good👍 Had the Black Label Burger with string fries. However, beer selection was large but largely unimpressive. Was hoping for more local brewed options but most were beers I can go buy at the store for much less. Came for the beer but was satisfied with the food. Don't think I would have a reason to come back here.</review>< Pics>

<Text>If you want to watch sports, this is the place!  Huge screens and lots of seating. Everyone orders at the bar so there is no table service. You are on your own to get the next round. Arcade games line the walls so I'm sure it can get loud in there on the weekends and evenings.</Text>< Date>

The 5 Line Tavern pub is the most fun, friendliest, and efficiently- run bar in CA! Its a great spot for all games and will not disappoint when it comes to service amidst the mayhem of competing teams and fans!< /text>

<review>Try the Calamari poppers (they call it calamari) and the 5 Line burger (they call it burger). Food is excellent, lots of beers and great place to watch the Pats dominate the Giants (or whoever). All good people all around, highly recommend. If Eric is behind bar ask him anything about whiskey.

Most importantly, Vermonters welcome!< /review>< Response>

<Review>So, these are the best fish n chips in the city (true story) !! It's also the best sports bar in the city !! It's also the best nachos and Jell-O shots and occasionally you get a jaeger rep in a deer costume taking polaroids of you...which is the best in the city. Now, I don't watch sports or have ever had fish n chips outside of this bar but I guarantee you...best in the city!!!< /Review>< date>

{'time': 1554575928878, 'text': 'Brandon, thanks for taking the time to write this. As a business owner this is the exact type of review i like to receive because it gives full context.\n\nYou’re right, our new menu and offerings started April 1st, and with all the moving parts that go with that it seemed we posted on the new website too soon. We’re sorry for the confusion.\n\nWith all the changes we have made this week I’m sure on your next visit you’ll see what a difference they make. And yes, we have a great fish & chips.\n\nAgain, thanks for the review and come back soon. Tom.'}</resp>
<review>Food was fine, of what we got. The website was updated to match the new items they were going to offer in April, but we arrived in March, which meant none of the mains we wanted we're available yet. Major disappointment, so I didn't eat. My companions found suitable substitutes, but I didn't, so I enjoyed the pretzel and that was it. We sat on their enclosed patio where they had decided to keep the heaters turned off, even though it was in the sixties. The menus were honestly filthy, I assume because they didn't want to print new ones before the menu change over, but let me tell you what isn't appetizing at all, a filthy restaurant, which is all I can extrapolate when the menus are covered in a heavy film of gross from all the hands that had fingered them before. I'll try this place again, now that the menu's changed, and hope they have five star fish and chips, which I couldn't order on this first, dissappointing trip.  It gets three stars because the waitress was nice, the food we got was fine, and I really liked the decor, and the focus on classic Los Angeles. It's hard to ignore the other problems, let's hope they solve them.</review></record></dataset><record>
<text>Cassidy was our server at on the patio and she was absolutely amazing. My husband ordered the pistachio pesto noodles. The flavor was tantalizing to our taste buds. I had a drunken chicken sandwich which was very flavorful as well. We will happily come here again.<//text>< rating>

<text>This place has changed...smaller menu... chef does not fulfill requests (I asked for medium well burger and I got a rare burger) ... service is still great... unfortunately I will not return... review below was before ownership changed.

This one of my go to places. Great HR from 11a to 4p...buy one get second for a penny.

Food is excellent.  Service could be great or not depending on the server (only one really). Although the menu is somewhat limited it is ALL GOOD!

I like the sausage plate, the salads, the pasta, lobster ceviche.... good food.<//text>< response>

We tried the bar/cafe on a Friday night because there were open tables. The entire experience much to be desired. Food was overpriced for the quality. Fries were inedible due to intense amount of salt. Layout, atmosphere and service was awkward. No reason to return really.<//Text>

5 line is a nice place to sit at the bar or snag a table with some friends inside or patio if you like and order a craft beer (too many to choose from on tap)  or order some chow from the menu, plus bottled beer and full liquor bar. The bloodies are pretty strong if you like that on a Saturday or Sunday. To watch a game or not watch the game? Who cares and have some delicious pizza from big mama's next door delivered to your table I would order that over anything on the menu!< /Review>

Review Update: 08.08.17 I wrote a review when this place first opened. 5 stars. Everything about this place was great. Now, u can forget about it. OVER PRICED to the max. Can I afford it? Yes, but it is worth it? Hell no. Save the money and hit up another tavern. It's better and you'll save a few bucks.<//text>

This is petty cool sports bar.  They have a good drink selection for happy hour.  And a good location right on Colorado blvd. My biggest complain is the price on the food.  A bit much,  for OK food.<//Text>

I lived in the area most of my life decided to try this place it happened to be Super Bowl Sunday I called ahead of time they said they weren't busy they had plenty of seats when I got there I walked into the main floor and I was tol oh you have to sit outside and I'm like looking at it for five seats that are available and I'm there with my wife and I'm like okay and then I sat outside and it was if the people just didn't care extremely rude I was looking in the kitchen and they start me some why are you looking at the kitchen are just watching to see who's cooking the food cuz they're right next door to Mamas and Papas I don't know if it's the same kitchen or what food was terrible experience was terrible plenty of seating I sat on the patio they had heaters little chilly but it was fine but just rudeness what is up with customer service these days people don't want to serve you I don't understand it and then to top it all off when I got my change back I was shorted $5 when I made them aware they did not even apologize he said oh it must have stuck to the $20 bill but I give him $100 bill not a 20 never going here again check your change< /Review>

My wife and I have been coming to 5 Line for years now and absolutely love it. Sure it's a bit on the pricey side, but they go out of their way to make you feel at home. The food is great, the beer selection is awesome, the staff is courteous and friendly. What more could you ask for in a local sports bar?<//review>

<review>went to watch the rams@saints game there, atmosphere was great! it is like a mexican community, the restaurant has some GRAFFITI arround its walls, inside is pretty great, surrounding several tvs. food there is surprisingly great, i dont like mexican food too much. try the lobster ceviche, really fresh!
but by the way, it's actually more like a mexican sports bar, not as it said italian. you can see through the menu there.< /review>< username>

<text>Drinks: LOVE their beer menu, 50 Beers On Tap! Orange Blossom and Angry Orchard (cider). They are both light and fruity, just the way I like it!

Food: My favorite is Gourmet Sausage plate!! 3 types of sausage, Andouville, Chicken apple and Italian Sausage. It also comes with Bavarian kosher salt pretzel, sauerkraut, dijon mustard and whole grain mustard. They go soooo well with cold beer!

The Parking: On Colorado, street metered parking. Side street, residential area, free parking.</text><GmapID>0x80c2c16717b7e6dd:0x832cf4b353e7c092</GmapID><rating>4</rating>< pictures>

< Review>
I have seen this place in the area for some time and i also see them listed on Postmates. They have these pulled pork nachos that look amazing on the site and menu so i had to try them. What a waste of time and money. They tossed some chips in a to-go container, topped it with a little pico and cheese, then tossed HUGE chunks of tasteless pork on top. Where was the guac and sour cream that was pictured and listed on the menu?! That ish was nasty and just thrown together without a care. I've been here before with a friend and thought the food was overrated and over priced. I stand by that today and will never patronizing this business again. 😝< /Review>

Nice staff, great selection of beers on tap (they have Allagash Curieux!), pretty good food. Big Mamas & Papas Pizza is conveniently next door; they share the same kitchen. Never too crowded. Parking can be difficult sometimes.< /Text>

Loved this place. Could be because of the mild expectations of a place that offers too much in a single menu, but the pizza was amazing (huevos rancheros pizza), hamburgers were on point and beer selection is well curated.< /Text>

<Date>1582088998234<//Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>This is my daily morning coffee spot, and it has been shortly after they opened about 2 years ago. I highly recommend because 1) the coffee is great, 2) the team is nice and welcoming. I highly recommend asking for an iced caramel vanilla latte. It's not on the menu, but it's THE BEST THING EVER. <3

Totally recommend if you're looking for a local coffee shop to support!< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrHcFabTSBUa6IgHqGycWvB99vzDdTx5GvpleL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN01l0sLtqVmixG73BkG1UthjGpps0X93TYw4va=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHM-aRi5uK4sYACv0GNYnous10t_YH_8hoLyAD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

Great atmosphere - everyone is here to work, have group meetings or just chill and relax. There's 2.5 sections of the space - one fully indoors where you can order light bites & beverages, one outdoor garden where there are heat lamps, and another alcove space. Love it. Will totally new back.</Text>

<resp>None</resp><text>I’ve recently moved to LA from Atlanta and due to the Corona Virus it has been really difficult to adjust. I found Vanilla Black through people posting on social media about this incredible coffee shop. I went one time and I was hooked. Not  only because the coffee is incredible especially the Layla Latte and the Vanilla Bomb but Vanessa and the rest of the staff are extremely professional and kind and they easily make everyone feel welcome. I say all that to say Thank You for helping me feel welcome in a very new city. I will forever be an everyday costumer.<//text>< Rate>

<Time>1592913855400< /Time><rating>5< /rating><text>The cafe is marvelously unpretentious with a beautifully decorated large courtyard for all its patrons to enjoy. You never feel the pressured to leave like you do in some cafes. I remember coming here after getting in a car accident earlier that day and Katrina, the manager, could see I was visibly upset and asked me what was wrong. When I told her, she gave me my coffee on the house! They also give discounts to student and anyone who works in the Mar Vista area, just be prepared to show proof! You can really FEEL the sense of community and genuinely from the staff.< /text>< Pictures>

Some of the best coffee in LA!! I went here for the first time a few months ago and had the best matcha latte! I recently went back and tried their lavender latte and it was delicious!! I live in Highland Park, but I will always make the drive out to VanillaBlack Coffee! :)<//review>

<review>Vanilla Black is a great little spot for coffee. Vanessa, the owner, is wonderful, extremely polite and just plain charming.
The coffee selection fits the area well, and speaks well of the owner's choice.
Just come in, try it out, and enjoy.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Zero stars if I had a choice to the owner it's been over a month and you have not returned my calls or text messages. I need you to please contact me asap and be responsable for  the damages that your carts cause to my 2015 Toyota Camry. I'm sorry but I had no choice but to do this . Hope this gets your attention.< /Review>

Excellent local coffee shop for a quick pick me up. My coffee choice was the vanilla bomb it had a great taste and bold flavor and brewed to perfection quality over quantity. My barista was Jacqui I was welcome with warm smile. I would like to Thanks the owners Justine Zimbron and Vanessa Casticel for hiring Jacqui. Perfect local coffee shop would recommend it!!!< /review>

I have been to a lot of eyebrow places and this is one of the best! I've had all of the girls do my eyebrows and they all do an AMAZING job plus they take their time. I usually come during the middle of the day on the weekend and they can get pretty busy but I don't mind waiting.</review>

Really enjoyed how my eyebrows were done, very greatful. The girl was very nice, it was quick and easy. For the bad reviews, there are mirrors for a reason, not to mention you pay after your eyebrows are done, you have plenty of time to ask for corrections and such. I was shown my eyebrows with a close up mirror and was asked if they were okay.<//review>

I've been coming here for 3 years and not once was I ever unsatisfied. I've came here on bus, Lyft and the overall results were sooooo worth it. I do touch ups every 2 weeks, 3 at most because sometimes I'm lazy. But overall these wonderful ladies are simply nice and work wonders 😍. The only down side is the waiting :( but it's never that long of a wait.</text>

Very unprofessional having clients waiting outside of the studio, waiting for the owners to come open it. Store opens at 10am and they're still not here. This isn't the first time they've opened late. This is so annoying.</Review>

They do great eyebrows but do not follow the time schedule they have posted outside. They should follow their closing schedule, if not change it.</review>

Their closing schedule time is at 7 and the owner was putting a sign on the door when i had parked i walk towards the door and she closes the door on a pregnant woman at 6:02. I do not recommend bad customer service<//text>

This place has great food.  We found Taco Chon while visiting a nearby music festival.  We came back the next day also.  Simple menu, everything we tried was good.  Steak tacos and quesadillas, meat was so tender and tasty.  Chicken was excellent also.  Very clean kitchen and friendly staff!</Review>

This used to be one of my favorite Mexican places up here but in the past year their food has become really inconsistent. Sometimes I’ll order a burrito that I normally get and it will be something COMPLETELY different from last time from flavors to meat and sauces. It has gotten really bad with the consistent changes in food.
Hopefully someone will take over and give them a steady menu.< /review>

<text>It's okay. Like any business they try to cut some corners which shows in the food quality and yet the prices are to high for what you get. The staff is very friend and the service is good.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>Serving was immense. Taste was nothing to die for. Price was average for California.  Average truck stop fare. Not something I'd go out of my way for, a second time.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Iove the tacos funditos here they are delicious but there are some changes that's been made at this business I dont like which is they no longer sell fountain drinks except the horchata machine otherwise its only bottle soda now and none that I drink I am a mountain dew drinker and they dont offer that also when they first opened at this location the glasses of soda or horchata were really large now  the glasses are alot smaller so I dont go here as often as I used to because of the smaller glass of beverage and also the bottle sodas sold here aren't any that I care to drink so now I come here once or twice a year even though Iove the food here<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c36fb0ebdfcea5:0xe8e9d7459bc8e81b</GmapID></record>

<Text>Fairly good Mexican food.  Very nice waitresses. Prices are ok to good.  Have tried several dishes and they are all good.  Only one time the carnitas were too dry.  Otherwise, good experiences.< /Text><name>Felipe D. Koenig Gonzalez<//name>< Response>

This restaurant was bought by new owners I have only eaten here 1 time since the new owners have been there. Its inside of a truck stop... The food was ok but for a sit down restaurant they gave is throw away plates with cans of soda and plastic silverware... They need to up their game if they intend on staying... cheaper is not always better...</review>

I ordered 2 beef and cheese enchiladas rice and beans.  The food is above par but most notably the shredded beef was cut by someone who wants the guests to eat very well.  The meat was delicious and succulent.  I will return as soon as I can which will be regrettably too long.</Text>

I got a carne asada burrito, the few pieces of meat that was in it was good, but was mostly a beans and rice burrito. For the price I expected it to have atleast a handful of meat.<//review>

Used to like this place, came In and got a wet bean and cheese burrito and it was horrible. Sauce was all spice, I had to use sour cream and some guacamole that taste like it came out of a frozen taquito box, just to lube up a wet burrito. The tortilla was hard and my plastic knife struggled to get through it. Beans were dry and flavorless. I later learned the original owners don’t own this one anymore. Should of made then change the name.  2 stars because the staff was friendly and it was fast.< /text>

The homemade chorizo and cheese dish is must with chips. The tastes are delicious...muy rico. Check the times and get here Saturday for the homemade meatball soup.</review>< Pics>

<Review>-Food is flavorless but soaked in spiciness
-beef "asada" dry and tough
-tortillas are undercooked
+ service
+price
+portions

My personal opinion this place needs better cooks aside from that its wholesome for where its at being a truck stop.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I came to breakfast and asked for some divorced eggs that are on the menu and the waitress tells me that the cook does not make divorced eggs that I can order something else!

< Review>
My boyfriend and I just moved into the Broadcast Apartments and we have loved every minute! Lovely neighbors, clean common areas, responsive management.

We've had a few maintenance requests and they've been really quick and helpful.

The location is unbeatable. We've been jogging through Pan Pacific Park in the mornings (okay, walking) and popping over to The Grove for coffee (okay, ice cream...). But you get the idea -- so far it's been a dream to live here.

We are very grateful to have found this place!</Review>

ATTENTION!!! THIS IS AN HONEST REVIEW OF MY 2+ YEARS HERE!
READ FULLY!!

My last review was November 2018 (scroll down) stating that this is a HORRIBLE place to live if you want to sleep. There is excessive noise from the gym (avoid living above it). Avoid living anywhere near stairs, as this will shake your bedroom when people use it, avoid living here period in my honest opinion unless you are very young, don't work, and definitely don't have kids! Since my last review here are some more issues that management does not care to fully address.

1) Whenever my neighbor uses the washer/dryer my $4000/month "luxury" apartment shakes violently. This building was NOT originally built for washer/dryer in the apartments and the structure doesn't efficiently cancel the noise or 'shaking/vibrating' - there is nothing that can be done at this point because they have installed it in every unit. See below on HOW they installed it too....Expect it to bother you when your neighbor's do their laundry.

2) If you live anywhere the gym, expect to hear noise from people dropping weights, to even general use of the machinery. Like I stated above, the walls and structures are thin, and noise WILL travel through. The gym's hours are from 5am - 12am. Keep in mind and expect to be woken up or annoyed to the fullest extent during those times. They also do not have a courtesy security during times that you really need them. Office hours are 10am -6PM while the gym hours are from 5am to 12am. There is no posted signs of the on-site manager, contact number... nor do they publicize it.

3) DO NOT attempt to work here as a home office - ITS IMPOSSIBLE!!!!

4) The management has strict 'corporate' attitudes that won't bend even the slightest bit for you to accommodate your issues. Everything to them is about them making their quick $$$. Example: I asked them to terminate my lease due to the EXCESSIVE noise but they have refrained from doing so because it would leave them not making any money for a month. While i suffered listening to the high level of noise for 2 years, and was ignored as a resident.

5) Expect fire alarms to go off at all odd times, regardless who pulls the triggers or if it is shared with Erewhon market downstairs, no one at all should ever experience SO MANY false alarms (especially at 2am/3am) These alarms are EAR PIERCING SOUNDS - AN INFANT CAN GO DEAF. In fact, you CANNOT stay in your apartment due to the extreme extreme loud alarm sound. So if it does go off in middle of the night, expect to FLEE your personal space to avoid your ears deafened.

6) To give you an example, of what kind of people they are - they FORCED construction in my unit for 5-6 weeks every morning i was kicked out of my apartment from 8am to 4/5pm because they decided that they want to put washer and dryer units into all apartments. The kicker is that they then subsequently CHARGE you $100+/month for the washer and dryer. There was no way to decline the work if you didn't want the units either. My apartment was dusty, noisy, left a mess more than several times, and really rendered it USELESS between those times. No compensation was given, no rent reduction was given, and no washer/dryer was given to me either unless i PAID them after the disaster construction. Can you imagine what they will do to you when it's time to update the living areas and kitchen areas? I sure as hell don't wish to find out. The LEAST they could have done was give us residents the washer/dryer without charging us.. But again, it's all about their $$..

7) Avoid living across the post office facing the grove drive - you will hear honking, shouting, cars, trucks and endless amounts of noise coming from their employees and method they do business.

8) When moving in ensure that you check your appliances thoroughly to make sure they work properly. I was given a broken refrigerator when i moved in, and my electric bill was double the amount when i moved in. The manager in charge at the time dismissed their responsibility very quickly and was quick to blame me.< /text>

Great amenities: Wine night every night by the fire pit in the pool area.
Great location: Walking distance from The Grove, Pan Pacific Park, Erewhon (downstairs,, "too" ) and bunch of restaurants!
Great service: If you have any issues with apartment amenities, maintenance team will come to you right away. If you have any questions, management team will answer them right away.
I have never lived in such a nice place like this before. I am very very satisfied!</review>

<review>I wrote a review when I had recently moved in, and now have been here for close to 2 and a half years. People can get nit picky - but it's a large complex, and there are a host of unexpected issues that arise as a result, so sure it has flaws here and there. That said, I have come to know Barry and his staff and feel I get greeted with a friendly hello every time I see them. There are apartments with views, and apartments where you look into a quiet courtyard and feel escaped from the amazing area of town you are just steps away from. They offer maintenance and have a wonderfully nice staff - though (and again I mentioned this is a large building so I am not blaming them) sometimes you do have to be a squeaky oil to get the grease in terms of action. They can't do everything at once! All in all, I've loved my time calling this place home. I lived in a 1 BR by myself, and my (friend (and current roommate) was put in a situation where he needed housing quickly. I said that I would look into breaking my lease and living with him under one stipulation: we live in Broadcast Center.

I moved in 36 hours ago and I am praying this is not a case of bait and switch.
The apartment layout seemed great for what we were looking for and the complex seemed very nice, and reasonably quiet considering the location during our tour and while we were moving in. Tonight is my first night sleeping at the new place and before even unpacking I saw a pretty gross looking bug in one of the bathtubs 😣 (strike 1). After clearing my mind of that and trying to not freak out, I finally got to sleep only to be awoken a few hours later by a building wide fire alarm.

It is 3:20 a.m. and at this point the fire alarm has been going off nonstop for the past hour and 12 minutes. It doesn’t appear that anything is on fire. No idea what is happening or why. Proceed with caution if you are checking this place out.<//Review>

I recently moved into the Broadcast Center and it's been amazing so far. The apartment is SO nice and has amenities that have already made my life so much easier. The leasing office has been extremely responsiveness and has made the move so easy. I love that there's a resident portal that can be used whenever I have a maintenance request or question about something in the building. The apartment is beautiful and I'm excited to be living here!< /review>

<Text>We moved into the Broadcast Center at the end of August 2020, while we have only been here 3 weeks so far, we have run into a myriad of issues that should be flagged for potential residents. On move-in day, the problems began. Our moving truck was not accounted for and they did not have room for the truck to be parked out front, we had to ask other residents to move their truck so we could switch. Since the BC sets appt times they should be responsible for making sure all residents can properly move in at their assigned time. Additionally, making movers use their back freight elevator adds almost 2 hours on to your move, which I was of course responsible for paying. I brought this to the community manager's attention and he basically shrugged and said oh well. On move in day, we were told that the upstairs unit had just been vacated and they would be doing a bit of construction for touch ups. Turns out, it is a full apartment remodel and they have been working LOUDLY for a full 3 weeks 7am-10pm everyday. Super fun with work from home. Due to these subpar construction workers, a pipe was hit and our entire kitchen ceiling leaked for a day before it was fully fixed. We now have water damage they have yet to fix. Only a day later it happened AGAIN and our guest bathroom exploded with water. One major note as well is about COVID protocols in the building. The amount of tenants who do not wear masks in the shared spaces including elevators is STAGGERING. To the point I have to take the stairs because residents will lash out if you ask them to wear a mask. I brought this to the community manager's attention about a week ago and he said he would put out more signs to note that masks are required (which should have already been done). Of course, he still has not actually done this. I have not even mentioned the cockroaches in the bathtubs or constant street and shared space noise that is conveniently brushed over on your tour even if you ask about it. While I would not consider this to be a bait and switch, it is pretty clear that elements of the complex are hidden from potential tenants. The surrounding area is very walkable and nice but in terms of what you are paying for, definitely beware. Hopefully things will improve.</Text>< Name>

It was the perfect LA apt. And they answered all of our questions in a very quick matter, including finding my roommate a place within our budget. It's pretty hard for two people to agree upon the same thing, but once we saw the Broadcast center apt we were like THIS IS IT!

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>BEWARE: ALL RECENT POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE PURELY BECAUSE THEY OFFER TO ENTER YOU FOR A CASH PRIZE FOR THEM, SO THeY CAN BURY ALL THE HONEST NEGATIVE REVIEWS. I am a current tenant and have spent the last few months following up with management trying to speak to different people in the hopes that someone would be Compassionate and reasonable about not raising rent during a financial crisis, when I’ve lost more than half of my income for reasons out of my control. However, I've been treated terribly, with not a single person having a real conversation with me, taking my personal circumstances into account. It's as if you are dealing with robots who continuously send a stock response about accepting credit card payment or suggesting you should find someone else to pay your rent for you. I’m at the point where they don’t even respond to me or acknowledge my valid questions and concerns. It's beyond offensive and honestly just shameful. I guess that's what you get for living in a building ran by a larger management company that does not care whatsoever about its tenants or doing the right thing. You are nothing but a rent check to them. If you are reading this because you're considering moving into this or another aimco managed building, do yourself a BIG favor and look elsewhere. These people do not deserve your money or to have any control of your life and living situation. Also please note that any positive review you see online about this building is sparked by a financial incentive they literally offer you to write a good review. So just to recap: they WON'T agree to not raise your rent during a global pandemic and financial crisis, but they WILL offer to submit your name for a cash prize in return for contrived positive reviews online. Disgusting.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Normally I don’t write reviews but In this case I feel like is needed. After applying and paying the $1000 holding deposit. They declined our application and now we need to wait up to 10 days to have our money back. The communication was horrible, they didn’t explain anything very well and said such things as I had bad credit because I didn’t paid my rent on time ( not correct ) that never happened and it was very unprofessional to say those lies in an email together with my roommate. Do not live here... very unprofessional. Also before we got offended we even tried to offer more deposit and showed them our bank statement with more of the double that the rent cost. They denied us. They just didn’t want to rent the apt to us. Very rude !<//review>

5 stars: Broadcast Center Apartments at the Grove is such a beautiful apartment with amazing management and wonderful residents! I feel so grateful to live here, I could not ask for better! The location at the Grove is simply perfect, and all the amenities that the Apartment provides are above and beyond anyone's expectations. I moved in about a month ago, and I am impressed by the ambitions of the management: they are installing high technology door locks and handling in-unit constructions for dryers/washers very professionally. I hope to live here long-term, as I cannot even dream of a better apartment in Los Angeles!< /text>

<review>AVOID THIS APARTMENT AT ALL COSTS.  I recently terminated my lease with the apartment.  My Final account statement included a $150 late charge fee for my final rent.  When I originally paid my final rent, I did so using the online system for the apartment. I clicked to pay my rent and selected the "Current Amount Due" option.  The Current Amount Due did not include $78.80 in ancillary fees (Sewer, Pest control, etc.) that I owed for that month.  I had no idea that these fees had not been included and paid what I thought was the current amount due as stated in the online portal.  I later find out that I'm being charged a $150 late fee because I did not pay the full rent due ($78.80 was missing from my payment because the online system had not included this amount in the current amount due).  When I tried to explain that there had been a computer glitch and the $78.80 had not been included in the total amount due when I made my payment, the rude operators told me that the late charge will not be removed unless I had proof (a screenshot for example). I tried explaining that it makes no sense that I would reduce the almost $2,000 I paid a few weeks ago for my final rent by such a specific figure of $78.80, only to later be charged a $150 late fee, which was taken out of my security deposit.  The operators continued to say that they would not do anything and that the late fee would be charged and taken out of my security deposit.  This apartment will do everything possible to take as much money as they can from you.  They will attempt to charge as many late fees as possible.  Avoid the headache of always having to deal with management operators to make sure that what you are paying is the correct amount.

Aside from the issue mentioned above, the elevators at the apartment were constantly broken.  There was an instance where residents were stuck in an elevator for several hours because it stopped working while they were inside. The building alarm system does not work properly.  For a few months the alarm would be randomly triggered at various points throughout the day (sometimes early in the morning at 5 am, sometimes at night).  And management at the apartment is very rude and condescending.<//review><Name>Sevan Niazi<//Name><GmapID>0x80c2b92e0971b6cd:0x4ac47198cc9cb231</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Really have enjoyed this place so far - great location, nice staff, lovely amenities, and a really solid bang for your back! Spacious apartments and new appliances ... Only thing I can think is that I wish I had in unit washer/dryer, but the laundry room is so easily accessible it really isn't all that big of a deal! Thanks</Review>

ATTENTION!!! THIS IS AN HONEST REVIEW OF MY 2+ YEARS HERE!
READ FULLY!!

My last review was November 2018 (scroll down) stating that this is a HORRIBLE place to live if you want to sleep. There is excessive noise from the gym (avoid living above it). Avoid living anywhere near stairs, as this will shake your bedroom when people use it, avoid living here period in my honest opinion unless you are very young, don't work, and definitely don't have kids! Since my last review here are some more issues that management does not care to fully address.

1) Whenever my neighbor uses the washer/dryer my $4000/month "luxury" apartment shakes violently. This building was NOT originally built for washer/dryer in the apartments and the structure doesn't efficiently cancel the noise or 'shaking/vibrating' - there is nothing that can be done at this point because they have installed it in every unit. See below on HOW they installed it too....Expect it to bother you when your neighbor's do their laundry.

2) If you live anywhere the gym, expect to hear noise from people dropping weights, to even general use of the machinery. Like I stated above, the walls and structures are thin, and noise WILL travel through. The gym's hours are from 5am - 12am. Keep in mind and expect to be woken up or annoyed to the fullest extent during those times. They also do not have a courtesy security during times that you really need them. Office hours are 10am -6PM while the gym hours are from 5am to 12am. There is no posted signs of the on-site manager, contact number... nor do they publicize it.

3) DO NOT attempt to work here as a home office - ITS IMPOSSIBLE!!!!

4) The management has strict 'corporate' attitudes that won't bend even the slightest bit for you to accommodate your issues. Everything to them is about them making their quick $$$. Example: I asked them to terminate my lease due to the EXCESSIVE noise but they have refrained from doing so because it would leave them not making any money for a month. While i suffered listening to the high level of noise for 2 years, and was ignored as a resident.

5) Expect fire alarms to go off at all odd times, regardless who pulls the triggers or if it is shared with Erewhon market downstairs, no one at all should ever experience SO MANY false alarms (especially at 2am/3am) These alarms are EAR PIERCING SOUNDS - AN INFANT CAN GO DEAF. In fact, you CANNOT stay in your apartment due to the extreme extreme loud alarm sound. So if it does go off in middle of the night, expect to FLEE your personal space to avoid your ears deafened.

6) To give you an example, of what kind of people they are - they FORCED construction in my unit for 5-6 weeks every morning i was kicked out of my apartment from 8am to 4/5pm because they decided that they want to put washer and dryer units into all apartments. The kicker is that they then subsequently CHARGE you $100+/month for the washer and dryer. There was no way to decline the work if you didn't want the units either. My apartment was dusty, noisy, left a mess more than several times, and really rendered it USELESS between those times. No compensation was given, no rent reduction was given, and no washer/dryer was given to me either unless i PAID them after the disaster construction. Can you imagine what they will do to you when it's time to update the living areas and kitchen areas? I sure as hell don't wish to find out. The LEAST they could have done was give us residents the washer/dryer without charging us.. But again, it's all about their $$..

7) Avoid living across the post office facing the grove drive - you will hear honking, shouting, cars, trucks and endless amounts of noise coming from their employees and method they do business.

8) When moving in ensure that you check your appliances thoroughly to make sure they work properly. I was given a broken refrigerator when i moved in, and my electric bill was double the amount when i moved in. The manager in charge at the time dismissed their responsibility very quickly and was quick to blame me.< /Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>This apartment complex is in a great location and has wonderful amenities, including a saltwater pool, dry sauna, gym, fire pits, grills, package room, screening room, lounge and more. They're updating all the units so that they have in-unit laundry, smart thermostats, and keyless entry, which is pretty cool. Because they provide so much, the units are a little bit more than other places, but I think it's definitely worth it. The management company has been easy to work with.

One issue that has come up a few times though is that the fire alarm has gone off multiple times. I was advised to call 911, but each time was a false alarm. Also the floors/ceilings seem to be pretty thin as you can hear a lot from up above, but not so much on either side.</review>< response>

I love living at the Broadcast center! The location is incredible and walking distance to tons of restaurants and shopping. I also love the fact that the building has a nice gym and I don't have to pay for an expensive gym membership at another place in LA. The other residences in the building are all quite nice. I never have any noise complaints and I never hear anything through the walls.

It's such a fun and safe place to live! I'm always telling my friends they need to move in!<//Text>

<Review>This is the first time I am writing a review. This apartment building looks nice in the first glance. However, after living here for 3 months it has been the worst experience ever. I also talked to many tenants and they had the same idea. It has insects, bugs and cockroaches. It is loud and very noisy. The management is the worst possible and they are basically a mess.

I talked to management many times and they don’t care at all. They just write under reviews they will take care everthig but they wont. I even had city inspector came and said they are violating the habitability code!!! So here it is not even habitable, but they still manage to don’t care at all!< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2b92e0971b6cd:0x4ac47198cc9cb231< /gmapID></record>

DO NOT BELIEVE POSITIVE REVIEWS. I am convinced these are paid for. Please take the time to ask the actual residents during a visit. Not a single person I met at these apartments has a positive experience.

They are liars and I have never experienced such horrendous treatment of people who are customers. After lying about renovations, and constantly giving us excuse after excuse, they have done absolutely nothing about damages to our expensive furniture and inconvenience. They’ve built in washer and dryer units into our BEDROOM. These were said to go in the living and dining area which would be much more reasonable.

We will be suing this company for damages and the incredible time waste and infringement on basic decent rights any tenant has. Do not waist your time here. Terribly regret moving here. Many have left.

Burglaries, inconsiderate construction, malicious absolutely malicious and manipulative business practices.

Response to George - I have tried to reach out to your corporate MANY TIMES. And you asking the REAL tenants on this review whether or not they have tried to work with management when they EXPLICITYLY say that their experience with them has been IMPOSSIBLE just shows you are not even reading the review and are just writing for writing sake.

You guys don’t actually DO ANYTHING. Just talk.

AGAIN, to anyone considering, AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE</Text>

Very unfortunate, don't move here.

[Update:  Just added photos of firefighters attempting to get people out of the same elevator that trapped me for 20 minutes.  Figured I should document these when I see them come to rescue people trapped in the same elevator over and over.  This is at least the third time I've seen firefighters come for this elevator.]

The false fire alarms that have gone off a dozen times in 11 months?  Nuisance, yes, but even more than that, it's dangerous.  So many residents here don't even bother leaving their apartments because of how many false alarms there have been.  And why have they happened, where here's the running list of reasons I've gotten from management:
Multiple times it was the vendor's fault for apparently "tripping" the fire alarm during some sheet rock installations or something.
A couple of times it apparently could have been a prank, but don't worry, they ostensibly found out who it was and stopped that.
And MOSTLY it has been due to the system just being riddled with malfunctions.

The false alarms have gone off at 4AM, at 6AM, at 11PM; it's been pretty time-indiscriminate.  Try getting back to sleep after waking up to a 4AM fire alarm and having to make your way down 6 flights of stairs (I'm on the top floor).

It's downright negligent, and is past the point of dangerous.

Next, the elevators.

Well, they are frequently malfunctioning and being taken offline.  It would seem that they would get them serviced properly, once, but they've gone down far more frequently than any other building I've ever been in.  I got stuck in the elevator for 20 minutes once, with 5 other people, the air conditioning goes off which was fun, and one of the people in the elevator began to hyperventilate and nearly passed out, and we had to call 911.  That only happened to me once, but the other night, fire engines showed up because it happened to someone else apparently.

Ah, as I mentioned, I'm on the top floor.  I always move into top floor apartments because I don't like people above me able to wake me up if we have different schedules.  Well, more than half a dozen times in the last 11 months, different vendors and maintenance people have been on the roof at all hours of the night, outside of normal business hours and even outside of the LA County allowed construction hours.  It's happened at 6AM, and 11:30PM before, which is such a wonderful thing to wake up to, people traipsing across the roof loudly without regard to people sleeping in the rooms below them.  The other night it happened again at midnight, and I spoke with management ONCE AGAIN, and got the excuse "it was emergency maintenance" -- oddly the person had no tools with him.  Just a flashlight hat thing.  And last night, this happened again at 1:45AM, and I've still not gotten a response as to what the excuse is this time.  Is it maintenance?  Okay fine, I get it, stuff needs to be maintained on the roof.  It'd be great if that stuff was maintained in advance so it's not in need of being fixed at midnight a few days ago, and 1:45AM last night.  Seems like a few days ago they could have planned to then fix it between 9AM - even 10PM the next day, or over the course of the next few days, but instead they waited until 1:45AM last night do it?

Also, there are very few visitor parking spots, and there are a ton of blind spots coming out of the garages, so be careful.

Some of the exits require a fob to get out.  I've seen people trapped in the garage several times, waiting for cars to open the gates, or for someone to come along with a fob to let them out.  It's crazy.  Should exits, marked as emergency exits, require fobs to get out?  Seems negligent to me.</text>

Pest control, trash, maintenance, and some weird online fee for paying rent online... before you know it you’re paying $100 more than your quoted rent. Plus, when construction needs to work on your apartment, they will just unlock your door with their master key and leave it open, they leave your AC on when they leave, and the water doesn’t work half the time. There are far better options in the area. Do not choose this place!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>
{'time': 1537458526179, 'text': "Hi Max, we don't have any hidden fees, as those are all laid out in the lease. Naturally, utilities are separate from rent and are not included therein. Paying rent online doesn't necessarily have a fee, either. If you pay with a bank account, as most residents elect to do, you will not be charged any fee whatsoever. As far as construction goes, I will ask the team to ensure the workers do not leave your AC on anymore. Thanks! -George"}<//response>

The issue with the package happened because we have a very secure package locker system, which  is connected to a central console with a list of registered residents. If a courier can't find a resident name on the list, they can't open one of the lockers and must return the package to sender. The staff has nothing to do with sending packages back, and indeed this new system was installed so that staff didn't have to constantly watch over package delivery. In the future, you can simply put the name of the resident on the package being delivered. Thank you. -George"}< /resp>

I was visiting a friend for the holidays. The building leasing office staff were horrible to us. Micro aggressions every time we crossed paths. One for instance we had ordered something and put our name and address on the mail to the building. Instead of receiving the package, letting it come to the apartment, or calling the name on the lease they simply sent it back. A package that took a week to come and was time sensitive they just sent it back. When we asked about this they simply said “we can’t receive mail there because our name was not on the lease.” But why not call the name on the lease and ask them? Is this decision to be made by the person who pays the rent. The only people that can receive mail our the names on the lease? What if someone has kids or someone visiting? Or a misspelled name or an alias?
It was done out of spite and pettiness. Something I expect adults to overcome. If you plan on living here don’t invite friends over or they will be harassed by the leasing department. Besides this the building was really and nicely located. Just need to update the leasing staff on professionalism.<//Text>

We have been living here since June. This apartement buliding has lots of potential but it is managed in the worst way. The management here abuse their power and don’t care about tenants. They forced us to do excessive unnecessary construction in my building without accommodating us. They basically harmed my newborn baby and when I talked to the management they didn’t care and I tried to email and talk to them but they were non responsive at all. I wouldnt recommend living here. They are many better places at better cost in the area.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Let me just say that we really do love living at the Broadcast Center Apartments!
We moved in last November and after a few kinks like our first time with Central air/heat (being from NYC) we are enjoying calling it home! Firstly the area is the best..the Grove outdoor shopping mall is down the street and there are plenty of shops and restaurants on 3rd and even Beverly. Our apt is lovely, they normally respond to  service problems within 24 hrs , laundry rooms are well maintained (however I still do not understand why they have not upgraded the machines to put money on your laundry card to accept credit/debit cards) pool is great, although  would like to see an outdoor shower (to rinse off all that chlorine)....BBQ's are great, area kept very clean as is the Gym...lots of machines to choose from. Tenants lounge while great, is only opened during office hours, which seems very strange.. really it should close when the BBQ area and pool close...they need to separate it from the office area, so that tenants can use it in the evening. Even the nite time security men at the desk in the lobby are great.....Tim ( the building manager), does a great job holding it all together  as we have had a complete office turnover (with the exception of Tim) and Stephanie at the front desk is great! One more thing I would love to see is a community board on our website (had this in our NYC apt) where tenants can communicate, like moving out sale or cleaning girl needed or do you need a dog walker/cat sitter? Or maybe just a community bulletin board where we can hang our business cards! The building is well maintained and clean and we are very happy!< /text>< Pics>

I love the apartment. I have a loft, which has a great view of both downtown LA and the Hollywood Sign.

the maintenance team is very helpful and effective

love the SPA. It would be better if its close time can be extended to a late time.</Text>

You really don't want to live here.

I'll start by stating that all of the recent 1 star reviews about this place are 100% warranted. The gripes about the elevators, fire alarms, construction, security, rude managent are all true.  I find the positive reviews fairly suspicious at this point.

Construction: The building is currently "under construction."  It started with LARGE construction site boxes being set up in the hallways for staging as they install washer/dryer units in each apartment. They then painted these boxes and wrote in massive letters, "MODERN CONVENIENCE."  I'm fairly certain this phrase was written in hopes that it would distract all the current residents for the very inconvenient times that lie ahead.  We were informed that construction crews would be in and out of the apartments for 3 weeks.  Starting on the first day, while I was in the shower, I received a knock on my door.  Not my apartment door, but my bedroom door.  I turned off the shower to tell them I needed a second to put some clothes on.  This happened two more times as the crew seemingly likes to come in no matter what.  Pretty inconvenient.

About mid week I received an email from Cherokii asking us, "if you have made a decision on whether you would like the new washer and dryer amenity added to your home. This will add $100 per month to your lease and the convenience of not having to travel to a separate area with your laundry."  This was just a promotional price, that will go up once the construction is finished(if it's ever finished.)  I stated, in my response, how ridiculous it is to be asking current residents to pay even more than we pay now for these "luxury" apartments, and that I would like the washer and dryer installed for a fair price of $0 a month.  Cherokii said no, obviously.  I never expected anything else.

The next week, I came home to my room completely uprooted.  The construction crew is supposed to put everything they've moved, back to where they found it when they are done for the day.  My nightstand, light fixtures, and other electronics were left on the complete other side of the room.  I took a picture of this and sent it to Cherokii on 8/20, and have still not received a response.  This is just a small sample size of the complete lack of care that the management team has for this property. They also leave the doors open while they work and after they leave so we have a bunch of bugs around our apartment.

We also received a letter stating that construction is going to be extended for another 2 weeks.  So 5 weeks total of them being in your apartment from 8:00 am - 6 pm.  Can't imagine what you would do if you worked from home or had a pet.

Security: The fab entry from the garage to the elevator is consistently broken.  You can see the footmarks of people breaking into it.  They paint it over once a month to cover it up.  Usually, that elevator is broken or being used by the construction team.  When that is happening you have to use the stairs, but sometimes the door to the garage from the stairs is locked from the inside, so there's literally no way into the garage save walking all the way out of the building and in from the front.  Convenient.

Management:  Rude.  Unhelpful.  Dismissive.

AirBnB:  Strictly forbidden...Unless you want to do it.  There have been countless amounts of airbnb'ers coming in and out of the building.  I think management is trying to stop this, but clearly, it's not working.

How long are these reviews allowed to be?  I could go forever.  I'll let my roommate tell you about the massive bugs in his review.</Review>

They couldn’t care less about you, they send in their construction team army in whenever they feel like messing with your day, and I’d give this place 0 stars if that was an option. Stay far away!<//Review>

Very disappointed in the leasing process at Broadcast Center apartments. Saw a posting for a 1 bedroom apartment available August 18 advertised on Apartment Search. We had already been in contact with Barry at Broadcast Center regarding other apartments available. We requested they send us quotes for this apartment and another apartment available August 15th.They did. We decided to move forward with the August 18th apartment since this was less expensive. We filled out the entire leasing application and paid $1,000 holding deposit and $87 application fee. After we were finished and I was mentally moving in...we received an email saying the apartment was all set... For a Jan 1 move in date. Say what?!

We contacted them... Surely just a mistake in the system. No, when we finally got a response from Barry we were told he talked to "corporate" and that someone else leased the apartment at the exact same time we filled out our application. Really? Someone leased an apartment from August 18- jan 1? That's 4.5 months. The minimum lease they offer is 6 months. Now, we were told, the only apartment available August was $600 more than previous. Thanks but no thanks. Regardless  of whether or not we can afford this, I will NEVER give Broadcast Center or any other companies that use bait and switch tactics a dime. Interestingly, an apartment the same size and same price was listed on Apartment Search the next day. Be on guard for ghost listings by this company! Also, it took almost TWO MONTHS to get our money back. We had to dispute it with our credit card company and jump through lots of hoops to get our $$. And they asked if they could send us a check instead of returning it to our credit card!

Glad we discovered what kind of shrewd service they provide before we moved in. I'm sure they will try to drown out negative reviews with fake positive reviews, but potential renters BEWARE!<//Text>

I have lived at the Broadcast Center Apartments now for almost one year and have already put in my notice for a second year. I have found the facility to be clean, quiet, well taken care of and properly maintained. I love my neighbors, the service staff, security team and am grateful to the management Timothy Christian ( community manager ) Barry Hurt, Erika Giles, Stephanie Byrd in leasing Stephanie Peitzmeier resident relations and Leonardo Gonzalez, Kevin, Alfonso  & Juan in maintanance who sees personally to each of its many tenants every need. The grounds are gorgeous, fountains fill the landscape and lush greenery everywhere. If you are searching for a place to live you would be proud to bring your family & friends to, look no further. Walking distance to The Grove, Pan Pacific Park, CBS Television City and busy Fairfax Ave. 3rd Street and Beverly Blvd. popular shops and restaurant. Housed in the same building is Erewhon Market popular amongst the conisour of healthy foods & fine wines. The amenities are numerous with the gym, pool & jacuzzi, washer dryers on every floor and convenient parking spaces. See it for yourself and make your own decision and you'll see why I can't say enough about this magnificent & wonderful property. Respectfully; David Harrison Levi 5 Star Review<//Text>

<Text>I found this place on yelp and was unsure about it.  Wow. This plac was amazing! Their rates, for cars are great! They told me I would pay  between 8.00 to 10.00 max. They have a shuttle to take you to the CBX crossing OR the otay cross walking. They give you all the info you need to cross and pricing about taxis! My husband had lost his phone in the shuttle and it was returned! I can't say good enough things about this place! I highly recommend this place!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Zero stars for this place, I called for pick up, and no car was available for pickup. The man on the phone for pick up from the airport said to call an Uber. Also, the company said they would drive my car to pick me up, and I would need to return the driver...what a joke. They have one vehicle, and it's an old van that is not dependable. They should at least provide a backup car.

End of the situation, the worker ended up bringing his van because another family refused to get an Uber. NEVER AGAIN!!! Other companies provide the same discount.

On top of this, I was charged an extra day because I was over hours.<//Text>

<review>Great and quick service - only weird thing is they don’t actually drive you in front of the CBX drop off  area so if you have a lot of luggage it’s a drag, you do have to walk a little bit to get to CBX.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Best parking for CBX hands down. $7 per day, super friendly service, clean, organized and a free shuttle ride. I feel very safe there and secure leaving my car with them. Did I mention how friendly they are? Great service!!</Text>

Ellos estacionan los vehiculos conforme a la necesidad, y se entiende, lo que no se entiende es que chocaron el auto de mi esposo (lexus) y no quieran pagar, vieron los videos y efectivamente admitieron que ellos habian ocasionado el daño pero no son responsables para pagar. Probablemente a nadie le ha pasado algo similar, eso no quiere decir que eso no sucedio.

My husband parked his lexus there and when we pick up the car I noticed some scratches in the rear bumpers, smalls but deep, they review the video and admitted that the staff cause the damage, is been over 2 month and we cannot get a hold of Pedro, (the manager) to pay the damages, he received the estimation but never responded, it may be people that said that never happen to them, but it doesn't mean that it can happen.
I do not recommend this place. I booked with them because of the reviews but the parking lot looks crowded, so is very easy to have incidents there.<//review>

Drove in, unloaded suitcases from my car to the shuttle van, parked my car and signed a form and left for the CBX all in five minutes. Driver gave me a receipt for the car and phone number to call from CBX. Dropped us off at the CBX after about 8 minute drive. No hassle, no wait, very nice. He told us to call when we got through customs and expect a 10 minute wait for him to arrive. He also showed us where to wait. Easy! Highly recommend this place.< /Text>

Cheapest place to park your car, someone is always there, they also do a free shuttle to the border and cbx, they are friendly and quick, if they aren't there they are usually picking people up at the cbx or the border< /review>

< Review>
Drop-off at this place was ok, which is the reason I’m giving it two stars, rather than one. We returned from our trip from Mexico around 10pm. It was 58 degrees outside...cold considering we had just returned from Puerto Vallarta and were only wearing shorts and t-shirts. Rather than picking us up by the doorway of CBX, which is where they dropped us off (we could've waited inside where it was warm), they had us wait near the driveway entrance of CBX by the sign (quite far from the CBX building). They told us they were leaving right immediately to pick us up. After freezing for 20 minutes we called them back to find out where they were. They told us that they were nearby and to continue waiting. After 40 minutes of shivering, we called them to inform them that we had decided to take a cab to their lot because we couldn’t wait in the cold any longer. However, they wouldn't answer their phone. In fact, their voicemail wasn’t even "set up" so we couldn’t leave a message. We tried numerous times calling, but no answer. So, we jumped in the cab and drove to their lot. When we arrived, their gate was closed, locked, and their office (trailer) was dark. We tried calling all three numbers posted on their gate. Same thing, no answer. We honked the horn of the cab several times, flashed the bright lights through their gate, and even yelled to see if anyone was there. Nothing! After roughly another 15 minutes, the driver showed up and told us that he couldn't find us at CBX...even though we stood exactly where he told us to (right in front of the CBX sign near the driveway entrance...there's only one). We were upset and he was very unapologetic...in fact, he displayed a temper with us. Then, he attempted to charge us for an additional day. We called him out on it and he blamed a malfunctioning computer system for the error. I was cranky and demanded a discount...considering he made us wait outside in the cold for 40 minutes and we had to pay a cab $25. He gave us a $10 discount. However, after we began driving home in my friend's truck we noticed that the ABS brake light was stuck on, which wasn't the case when we dropped it off. It appears that after a certain time, this is a one-person show. When they leave to pick someone up at CBX, they shut down and lock up the parking lot. So, it was futile to take a cab there. This was not conveyed to us beforehand. Suffice it to say, we will never be using this parking lot/service again.< /Review>

I like their service. Is cheap and convenient. Also they have free shuttle service to CBX bridge and the Otay port of entry. They also pick you up if you call them 15 min ahead.</Review>

Terrible service. i was going to the CBX to catch a flight, spoke to them in the morning and they said no need to schedule cause there is someone there ready to help. That is not true. I arrived around 11 p.m. and no one was there to open the gate. I called the number and a rude guy told me he was busy and couldnt help me. I then ended up in another parking a little more expensive but with a very good service. Dont risk trusting these guys from Lyon parking they are not reliable.<//text>

Great service during the drop off, picking up however was not the best. It's only $5 per day which is super economical so I guess you get what you pay for. I called in advance because I read they give you a ride to cbx or the border and also pick you up and they confirmed they did. Unfortunately when I was ready to be picked up the service was not good, I called and they confirmed they would come get us,  but that we had to walk out of cbx into the street, my dad uses a cane and cant walk much but we made it work. After waiting for more than 30 min ( location is about 5-10 min away) we called back and the gentleman was not pleasant at all. I wasnt rude or anything i just called to ask if someone would be on their way soon because I my dad was already sitting at the sidewalk (this was at 12:30 am) and the gentleman told me it wasn't a ride and that he was doing us a favor. Obviously this got me upset .. I mean it was a cheap price that we paid but that's not the service we should have received. I told him I was unaware that it was a favor and that I had taken my car there because they confirmed they offered that service and he said .. well if you want me to go I will take your car, I told him it was fine so over all we waited over an hour and he picked us up in my car. On our way back to the lot to pay they charged me one extra day, for example we dropped of friday at 9 pm and picked up sunday night (technically monday) at 1 am due to the wait at cbx and that was already another day we paid. Total was $15 which is still less than a one day parking fee at cbx.  I still give them 3 stars because the service the first day was good and our first driver was nice. Will I take it back tho.. I don't think so.</Review>

I had to wait 60 minutes from the time I called to the time I arrived to the lot. We even had to go out of our way to pick up one of his employees somewhere else.
I complained bitterly and the young chubby employee Saturday night just told me “Next time take an Uber”. Just like that … no concept of customer service. He even said that shuttle was a favor and it a part of the service we pay for.
I have to say that I was wasn’t the most polite after that…

NEVER  AGAIN Lion Parking.  Clearly they don’t give any importance to the customer.<//review>

(Translated by Google) In this place the attention is very good, they are super friendly answering your questions and they help you. Their prices are competitive among other parking lots and compared to the airport parking lot, let alone! They offer you the free shuttle service to the CBX so that you do not fight or pay for Uber (only consider 30 minutes before the time you have to arrive at the airport!). It is super safe, we have used the service several times and we have never had any problems. You leave your keys with them and they give you a contact card and another one with all the data of your car, which you have to present the day you are going to pick it up to guarantee that you are the owner. When you return from your trip, you only need to call them and the Shuttle service goes through you !! They are very attentive and careful with your car. Super recommended !!

Es súper seguro, hemos utilizado el servicio varias veces y nunca hemos tenido ningún problema. Dejas tus llaves con ellos y te dan una tarjetita de contacto y otra con todos los datos de tu coche, la cual tienes que presentar el día que vayas a recogerlo para garantizar que eres el dueño. Cuando regreses de tu viaje, solo es necesario que les llames y el servicio de Shuttle pasa por ti!! Son muy atentos y cuidadosos con tu coche. Súper recomendado!!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Be careful when they charge you, they charge you for more days and rates, today I collect my car and a mr. With a beard, first he greets you well and then he overcharges you and I repeated that it was only 11 days and that it was the 7 x day rate and fool that it was 96 dll I do not know where he learned mathematics, in short, be careful with that people talk about mr. Of the beard that attended to me, it hurts that some pay others.

De la barba que me atendio lastima que por unos pagen otros.<//Review>

App ordering and curbside pickup were fast & easy! First time having Crumbl and the cookies were very good. The banana cream pie is 🙌🏻 Wasn’t a huge fan of the chilled sugar (too sweet) with an almond extract kinda flavor. Cookies were larger than I expected & are big enough to split to try more flavors. Will be back!<//Review>

Awful experience. I was very excited to try these cookies. I decided to do curbside and ended up waiting over 2.5 hours for my order. I finally decided to go inside because it had taken so long and they were about to close. When I went in to ask about my order the employee informed me that they had sold out of cookies. I never got my cookies I had already ordered and paid for. Very poor way to do business. I understand they just opened so it was busy, I just think its very unprofessional to sell out cookies before filling orders customers have placed and paid for.</Review>

Super busy. We order through curbside pick up and took about 1.5hrs to get the cookies after arriving at the store. We’ve been to other crumbl locations before and they don’t seem to take that long. The cookies were good though.<//Text>

I have visited the Brentwood location a few times and the cookies are extremely delicious.  They are a tad pricey $14.25 for four so it’s a nice treat to have every once in awhile or to give as a gift….but everyone will enjoy these cookies.

A new location has opened up in Concord and I’ve heard a new opening in San Ramon is just around the corner. Enjoy!</text>

<text>The line was long about 15-20 min wait on Friday afternoon. The staff was great. Cookies are huge. We’re order chocolate chip, banana cream pie, and chilled sugar. We enjoyed them all.</text>< pics>

OMG!  Warm and moist perfectly baked peanut butter Crumbl is amazing!  They put a thin drizzle of peanut butter on top that takes it to a whole new experience. I am getting me another one tomorrow.<//Text>

It's a $4 cookie.  5 different flavors available.  It's a very thick cookie, a little gooey, almost doughy in the center.  They have a kiosk system for purchases, no human contact for that part.</text>

I see where they got their name from.... When you pick up one of their cookies, it crumbles into many pieces. It IS very tasty, but you can't pick up a whole cookie without it falling apart. You will be relegated to eating crumbs. *update*... OK, gonna up my rating to 4*s...I believe the reason my cookie (peanut butter) fell apart is because it was still warm. But it was very tasty, also the chocolate chip cookies were REALLY GOOD. Might go up to 5*s if they lower the price a little.</Text>

<Text>Long wait just for cookies, but we wanted to see what the hype was all about! The smell of sugar permeated through our masks when we finally got in the door. Quick ordering when you know what you want. I mean, if you're waiting 20/30 minutes in line, you would think everyone would already know what they want by the time they approach the counter, right? Wrong. That's what holds up the line! LOL. The cookies smelled great, the kitchen was super busy! Cleanliness was a bit lacking if you ask me, refrigerator handles stayed dirty, kitchen staff all over the place with flour, eggs, oil, the boxes that the customers receive their cookies in are riddled with icing...messy, but the constant demand must make it tough to keep up? We ordered the 12 pack party box because why not? Cookies were very inconsistent as far as size, decorations/icing and amount of chocolate chips. A little disappointing to get a big chocolate chip cookie and your first few bites have ZERO chips. Errrggg. If it didn't taste like yummy butter cookies on it's own, I would have called to complain. My 2 dirt cake cookies were very dissimilar too, it was very evident that someone was cutting corners with the icing...wish I noticed before I left the store. Will I go back? Possibly...just to try some of the new flavors (that's the attraction I guess...always in search for the new stuff?) It's just sad to see that the fast paced work in the store makes employees serve inferior products for the prices you pay and the time you spend in line. Make sure you check the quality of your cookies before you leave!</Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
We ordered chicken momos and the chicken lollipop. Really liked the food. Their chutneys are amazing and make the food taste much better. The filling for momos was tasty and not at all bland like some other places. Chicken lollipop was nice and crispy. It wasn’t spicy though but we made it spicy using the chutneys;) Overall a great experience. Would definitely try other dishes later.< /review>

Yooo. The wait for the spicy chili Momos was totally worth it! Flavor is one thing but texture is super important to! Loved the chewiness the savoriness and the kick of heat! If you are a noodle person, they definitely have that also! Support ethnic and small business!<//review>

<text>I went here after seeing great reviews but the food was unsatisfactory. I had fried rice with Manchurian and veg fried Momo. I didn't like both of them. Fried rice was too dry and hard, and Momo filling texture was like mashed potatoes. There are many better food truck around. In terms of price I find this to be the cheapest option so probably that's reflected in quality.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808fb0cc3ce7b49b:0x65f622376080b3af< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The chicken momos are the bomb - and reasonably priced. I also really enjoyed the chicken lollipop and veggie momos.
Definitely recommend to call ahead your order because the wait can be long, but it's always worth it.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808fb0cc3ce7b49b:0x65f622376080b3af< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Namaste is really good sounding word in Nepali language and so does this food truck. They kept their name according to their customers service. I really enjoyed the food and that food was best food of the town. Located near San Jose, this food truck will never let you down.
I will highly recommend you to go there with your friends and family.</review>

<review>We tried their veggie stuff - momos, chowmein, manchurian, fried rice, roll. All good. Loved their chai. Food prep takes some time, but worth the small wait. Good packaging for takeaway. Parking nearby allows you to stay in your car while you wait, but there are also some tables and chairs next to the truck.</review>< user_name>

Food tastes decent. But very very oily.

Veg momos tasted pretty good, but there was oil flowing out of it if you break it. Are momos not supposed to be filled with steamed veggies, or stir fry at the max? It was more than deep friend - it just had oil flowing.

Fried Rice tasted good

Veg manchurian was quite bad. The manchurian balls had soaked the oil. Oil was oozing out as you try to cut it with a fork.</review>

<Text>Great good truck! They have a small menu but its perfect. Spicy and very close to Indian street food. We had vegetarian momos, chilli paneer and Veg chowmein. Everything was very well made and we enjoyed it all! Will definitely some back whenever I visit bay area.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Located in mountain view, I gave this a try last year as well. This time ordered a chicken thukpa, veg chowmein and chicken manchurian.

Thukpa was piping hot, average in taste and good value for money taking into consideration the portion that was served.

Chicken manchurian was no where close to what manchurian is like in reality. Discarded it.

Chowmein was dry and had no authentic flavours. Discarded it as well!</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQ7sSJBt_RemZ8Esk26LUwlVZmTnaqx79HK5lY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMycDJ3npnfPNrVf2SDN5kVmSUWUss4SkR8gqH2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Rate>

This is definitely my favorite food truck in the city. Situated right next to Castro/downtown Mountain View, the food truck offers delicious and high quality food for very decent prices. In particular, their chicken fried rice is absolutely incredible-- flavorful and filled with spices. Their chicken/veggie momos are also amazing, and I would absolutely recommend this food truck to neighbors.<//text>

If you want to try AMAZING authentic Nepali food, this is it. I am from Nepal and have lived there many years and the momo and chowela there is as good as what you'll get in Nepal. Definitely give this a try. This is not an Indian food truck by any means but I've heard they do a pretty good job. Must try the Nepali food! Ask them if you don't know which is Nepali or Indian food.</review>

If you want to taste Nepali Food and the delicious street food then this is the best place for you to stop over. They serve by small food truck and people can sit over and enjoy the outside climate while having their food.
Cons: If it is raining don’t plan to here, you will get wet.</Text>

The dishes these folks serve are absolutely delicious, it is a fantastic mix of North Indian and Chinese flavors. I have tried many of the non-vegetarian options and thinking about them makes my mouth water. The vegetarian options look tasty too. I think this is one of the best places to eat near Castro Street, and is definitely the best taste-to-cost ratio I've found in Mountain View. The chilli chicken chowmein is amazing, as long as you're ok with spicy food :-D< /review>

Very good momo though a bit smaller than what I am used to. The noodle soup was good also. However, the noodle in the soup appeared to be not hand pulled. It also looked like ramen noodle. I suppose this is different than Tibetan noodle soup.

The go-to place for this type of food is in Frankfurt, Germany (haven't been to Tibet yet), Tibetan Ama Kitchen... Likely the best momo and (vegetable) Thukpa outside of Tibet...

Add 10 mins to the time they say on phone. There are other indo-Chinese food trucks in the sunnyvale area which are much better.</text>< resp>

We ordered catering from Namastee Nepal and the whole company loved it. They said the food was delicious and interesting. We ordered the lollipops, chow mein, vegetarian rolls, white rice and vegetable fried rice. The trays were scrapped clean and people took hone leftovers. In addition the prices were shockingly reasonable and the ordering was very hassle free. Have cash for tipping when they deliver as they do not have signed receipts!

Thank you Namastee Nepal!

If you're order is to-go then I suggest sipping on some masala tea while you wait . It goes well with the ambiance of the gas station.<//Review>< pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Best place in the entire Bay area to get momos. For those who don't know what's that, those are steam cooked dumplings. They come with various fillings, being vegetarians we tried the vegetarian ones and I'm not exaggerating it at all, they were so flavorful and yummy. Equally good are the veggie Manchurian. We thought the paneer chilly was just about okay. But this food truck is only going to soar higher. Great place to come by yourself or just with friends. Service is very quick and meticulous.<//text><GmapID>0x808fb0cc3ce7b49b:0x65f622376080b3af< /GmapID><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Date>

Ordered chicken chowmien for my first-time experience here. Generous portion and tasty, peppery flavor. Simple plastic tables outside if you wanted to sit and eat. At first, I ordered chicken momo but decided against it after. The cook was kind enough to switch my order. While eating, I looked up Nepali cuisine and learned that chow mien is a favorite dish among Nepali. I looked up from my eating and found people around me equally enjoying their meal. I’d like to come back for the chicken momo.< /text>

Additionally the place is open late till 11pm so that's always an added advantage . Would definitely recommend this place !<//review>< Pictures>

The veggie Momo is the best I've had in this country (and I've had Momo's in a lot of places). They're open late so perfect for a cold night to warm you right up with the flavor and hot sauce.<//review>

<Review>The chilli chicken and noodles were really good. I've had better Momo's at other food trucks around but I definitely went back here for the chilli chicken . The quantity was good and it was well priced. It's a small truck located in the parking lot of a gas station with a small seating capacity.
Most people eat in their cars or order for to go .< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb0cc3ce7b49b:0x65f622376080b3af<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I just go here for veg manchurian..
I just love it and my taste buds go for a spin..
Chinese noodles are also pretty tasty..
We tried chilly paneer as well..paneer did not appear as fresh hence did not enjoy it that much..
Momos also were not of my taste..
But the manchurian is a treat for me..</Review>

<Review>One of the finest place to have indo-chinese cusine. It will give you nostalgic feeling of having Chinese in India. I love their Momo's, didn't had such Momo's anywhere in Bay area. Veg Manchurian, fried rice and chowmein is nice. It's a small food truck, so you might find it crowded, although there are few tables out for seating.<//Review><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

The momos were very good. Manchurian and chilli chicken tasted a bit too sour though. I guess too much of tomato sauce in them. I'd recommend going there for their momos and chutney!!< /review>

Conveniently located at Shoreline and El Camino Real. I've been there a couple of times in the evening. I've only tried their vegetarian/egg dishes, and they have all been mediocre. The veggie noodles were the best. The veggie & egg fried rice was ok, as were their veggie dumplings (momos). The veggie Manchurian was absolutely boring. Both the momos and the veggie Manchurian were made with chopped vegetable balls, so they had no unique flavor or texture. Very disappointing.<//review>

Very new, very clean truck. Not like your average roach coach.
Outdoor tables under an awning.
I had mo-mos, and I lived in rural Nepal for over a year, and used to devour mo-mos. Not THAT good, but not bad.</Text>

It's all really good, but the chicken lolipops and chow mein are particularly good. The chow mein has a different flavor profile from most (Americanized) Chinese restaurants, it's very good. Also, they have a great mango lassi. This place is open late which is nice. It is pretty slow though. I will definitely be back.<//review>< Rating>

Loved it. We had veg chowmein and veg manchurian. The chowmein was excellent, and crunchy. The manchurian sauce was a little sweet but it was still very good. And great value.<//text>

Thukpa has finally landed in the Bay Area! Been looking for it for ages. Would have preferred Tibetan style but can’t complain. Got chow mein Noodles sans heat for our daughter - she loved ‘em. Momos were also with a Nepali twist and soupy like xialongBas.  Authentic Nepali food. Clean w/ ample seating spots. Another solid cheap eat!< /Review>
