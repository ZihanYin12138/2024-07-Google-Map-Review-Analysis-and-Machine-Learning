<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Steve Wyatt was fantastic. He kept me informed almost daily of what was going on with my daughter's car. Being 3 hours away it was comforting knowing he was taking care of my daughter's car. Don't ever hesitate to call this shop for any kind of work on your car. You will not be sorry. Thank you Steve for all your work and dedication to making sure your customers are happy!!!!!< /Review><userid>109468663694941308901<//userid>< gmap_id>

This place and everyone who works there is AMAZING! Seriously the best. They were helpful, went way above and beyond. Quality work on the car, it looks brand new. Could never tell anything happened to it. I just can't say enough good things. I'd give 10 stars out of 5 if possible. Absolutely wonderful people helping with a stressful situation.<//Text>

<review>Steve Fuller and the entire Hild Collision staff provided courteous,  professional and completely satisfactory service.   The repair work was excellent.  They provided timely progress information and service.  I highly recommend their services.  From dropping the  car off, till the repair was completed and the car was picked up, they provided nothing but excellent service.<//review>< GmapID>

They communicated with me wonderfully and also my insurance directly.

Repair of 2017 Subaru Legacy after collision into my drivers front wheel. The vehicle was not drivable and looked like it would be “totaled”.
Then Hild Collision Center worked their “magic “ on it. They were professional, complete, and kept  me informed. My auto was brought back to “show room” condition. Thank you Hild< /review>

As a bonus, it was completed a couple of weeks faster than I had anticipated.  I hope this is my last repair from an accident.  But if there is another, I will be back at Hild.  Great people.

I did not get a rental car when I dropped my Cecile off on a Tuesday. I told my adjuster as long as I had it by the filling Monday at closing I would be fine for I had a Tuesday appointment. He assured me that would work. It is Monday and I have called as I had not heard from them. This time he said it should be done by sometime tomorrow, which is Tuesday. He said he could never have guaranteed the time, because he wouldn’t have known. I could’ve rented a car to make sure that this wasn’t going to be an issue.   I’m am extremely  disappointed with the broken promise of assurance, and no calls to give me warning, especially since I talked to me about it did not get a rental car due to his assurance.<//text>

First of all I have to give mention to Steve Wyatt. He was wonderful. The customer service and communication he provided was exceptional. He took care of all the details, assured me he would handle everything with the insurance company and he absolutely did. I never worried about a thing. He was just so pleasant to talk to. He treated me with respect and made sure my car was repaired with the best possible results. Thanks so much for Steve Wyatt!

Secondly my car looks so beautiful. I want to thank Hild for doing a superior job, even the inside was cleaned. Thanks also to Jason for pointing out things I never would have noticed...honesty, good communication and excellent service makes Hild my go to shop. Thanks everyone!!</Text>

I am a total perfectionist when it comes to vehicles, so I had major anxiety over how the repair was going to turn out. Hild assured me of the quality of their process, walked me through the facility and how the repair would be done, worked with insurance, and were spot on with the timeframe and delivery back to me. I was apprehensive when I went to pick up the vehicle and inspected it closely. The repairs by hild were nothing short of absolute perfection. They restored the truck to complete perfection. I was absolutely stunned at what an amazing job. The truck is even a special order color and the match is flawless. Unbelievable work. I interviewed all the shops in town, hild is the best. Glad I went out of my insurers “network” and went to hild. Start to finish, a 5 star experience for sure.  Don’t even waste your time, just go to hild.< /Text>< Resp>

I had the pleaser of working with Steve Wyatt and he was nothing short of amazing, he kept me up to date with my car and the repairs, he gave me a time frame of when my car would be completed and he nailed it to the exact day and time. He is one of the most patient people I’ve met and anytime I called he never made me feel like I was bothering him.

<Review>We were treated kindly and professionally throughout the entire repair. They followed through with every aspect of the repair (estimated time it would take correctly, called to let us know how it was going, were kind and courteous when we called).We were very happy with the repair as well as noticed the extra bonus of a door ding they touched up with the matching paint from the repair of the roof. Would have no hesitation being a return customer or highly recommending to someone else.,<//Review>< Response>

From the very beginning, Steve kept in touch with me to let me know exactly what was going on with my vehicle.  When it left the body shop, I was informed it was going to painting. I got texts for alerts and I also got personal phone calls from Steve. My car was completed one week sooner than expected. It looks great and I am very pleased with this company.</Text>

<Review>The quality of the work performed was second to none. All concerns about the job were addressed in the beginning before signing the authorization for work.

Customer service from the entire staff was awesome. No needs were left unaddressed.

I've used Hild Collision Center several times in the last 8 years due to wild critters going bump in the dark on our narrow winding mountain roads. I've never been disappointed with their excellent work "face lifts" on any of my vehicles.</Review>< Pictures>

They totally erased the noticeable dent and scratches on the panel over my rear passenger tire.  It’s as if it never occurred and looks brand new.  Returned car in better condition in what looks to be a complementary detail job.< /Review>

I have had the most generous compassion and respect from Heild Collison during my repairs to my car. Steve Wilson is by far the man you want to see and help with your repairs.  Steve went above and beyond his job to help me with my claim through the process. He did more for me than my insurance company (which I will be canceling).  I
recommend Heild and Steve Wilson for any and all your repairs.< /text>

<Text>They did great body and paintwork on my car. It was done in a professional and timely manner. They always kept me informed on the progress of the work. They also to my surprise cleaned my car inside and out! I left several items of value in my car and they are all still there. They even found money and a necklace that I forgot in my car! They are very good at there work and very honest. I highly recommend this company.< /Text><Date>1586364255591<//Date></record>

Wow!!! Is the first word that comes to mind. These dedicated professionals are even hard at work during the current pandemic!
When my wife's newer Infiniti was the result of a cowardly hit and run, I knew right where to go. The first time I did business with Hild was almost 20 years ago, and am happy to let the world know that the name still means excellence through the rebuilding process s. Thank you everyone for your professionalism, caring and support through this difficult time.< /Review>

<Text>Steve promised me I would have my vehicle back in 2 days and he came through on his promise.  Not only did Hild do an awesome job on the repair but they detailed our car as well.  No doubt in my mind, if needed in the future, where we will take our car for repairs.  And we will definitely refer Hild to anyone in need of repairs to their vehicle.  Thank you again Steve for getting our car back to us so quickly.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1576022698376<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Steve is the most professional person I’ve come across in Redding. He was very helpful and kept us in the loop the entire time and even added things on that he didn’t need to. I can’t recommend this place enough. Our window was fixed quicker than expected and it looks fantastic.</review>

<text>Steve is the most professional person I’ve come across in Redding. He was very helpful and kept us in the loop the entire time and even added things on that he didn’t need to. I can’t recommend this place enough. Our window was fixed quicker than expected and it looks fantastic.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Date>1565730319222< /Date></record></dataset><record>

They were very friendly,although they took longer than they said they would,but paid for my rental car for a few days.They did good work asthetically,but the passenger door that was damaged,hangs down a little when opened.Also the front passenger tire,was not balanced,my truck would shake when going over 50mph.< /Review>

I recently had my truck damaged by hail during a spring storm in Redding.  After looking at damage and getting a referral from a friend I chose Hild Collision Center for my repairs.  I met with Estimator Steven Wyatt and he assured  me that my truck would look like new again.  Well all I can say is I am very pleased with this business.  Very professional!  Steven kept me notified all through the process.   They were very quick and thorough.  Office staff was great, polite and courteous.   I would recommend  this repair  center to anyone!< /text>

I recently had some front end damage repaired at Hild.  I was extremely impressed that they went above and beyond what I expected.  The repair work was seamless, all the employees I communicated with were friendly and welcoming, the work was done when they said it would be, and when I picked my van up they had washed the exterior as well as detailed the interior.  The van was cleaner than when I dropped it off.  For a busy mom of 4 that was truly appreciated.  Thank you Hild Collision Center!</review>

The person who answered the phone was fairly professional until I pointed out that their quote was $200 more than the 4 other shops I called. He was like proud that they are over priced or something. Definitely would be more apologetic about the rate if it's higher than everyone else's.< /Text>

Jason was honest, and left it up to me as to what I wanted to do regarding my truck. He did not try to upsale me, which I greatly appreciated. I am very happy with the work Hild did. My truck looks great. As to all those I encountered at Hild Collision I found to be freindly, and helpful. I strongly recommend Hild Collision in Redding California.<//text>

I just had the best experience at Hild Collision Center.   My car was vandalized and I had to take it in for a repair.   From the time I got there they all treated me so well.   This was all a combined effort from my insurance State Farm, Hild and Hertz.   They all worked together so well.   I took the car into Hild, I was met there with my rental car and I was off.   The repair on my car was perfect and they detailed it inside and out.   Way more than I expected.  Then I went there with the rental car full of gas and exchanged it for my car.   Signed a couple pieces of paper and off I went.   Minimal time had to be invested in all of this.   So thanks for doing such an amazing job!!!</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Hild Collision Repair was amazing! My car is over 15 years old and needed a new bumper, which was not easy to find, but they diligently looked around the US until they located one that matched to help maintain the future collector value of my car. In addition, they detailed the car before it was returned to me and it looked fantastic!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I just had the best experience at Hild Collision Center.   My car was vandalized and I had to take it in for a repair.   From the time I got there they all treated me so well.   This was all a combined effort from my insurance State Farm, Hild and Hertz.   They all worked together so well.   I took the car into Hild, I was met there with my rental car and I was off.   The repair on my car was perfect and they detailed it inside and out.   Way more than I expected.  Then I went there with the rental car full of gas and exchanged it for my car.   Signed a couple pieces of paper and off I went.   Minimal time had to be invested in all of this.   So thanks for doing such an amazing job!!!< /Review>

<review>My car was hit and my front passenger side bumper, fender, and wheel cover was all messed up!!! I was so sad because I had just paid ot off and was very sad! I just picked up my car today and it looks brand new! They also made everything so easy, even down to returning my rental!

Thank you Hild!!!<//review>< Rate>

Very friendly staff that was very attentive to assisting me with getting my car back to looking like new after massive hail damage. Only three stars because I did have to go back several times after I found damage to my vehicle that was not there when I brought it in.<//review>

Though my car had a simple shattered grate and a slight dent in the front of the hood, the radiator magically broke and the hood started spontaneously bending more, all while the car was in their "care"; goodness, how did that happen?  Not to mention, expect opposition if you decide to retrieve it instead of allowing insurance to tow it away, they'll hold spite for the customer taking whatever little money they can get out of their grasp.  Their communication punctuality is laughable at best, as it took half a month to even notify me about my repair total DOUBLING the original estimation (I can only dread they were responsible for the radiator and further hood damage, but considering these happened after I left it in their shop, little evidence is needed to prove otherwise).  This process took almost 2 months to get finished, my only mistake was taking my problems to a scammer first when I could have repaired the issues in my own garage for 1/4 of the price.  Good to see the car's back up and going strong, saving it from Hild trying to put it in an early grave.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1549391750513, 'text': 'We’re sorry to hear of your negative feelings, it is never our intentions to leave someone with a negative perception of our 50 year old company which was built on honesty, integrity and excellent service.

It is never easy to suffer loss from an accident or vehicle break in as happened to us recently, but it is so good to know that the people at Hild will come along side to put things back together for you.  Professional and knowledgable, they work with you to keep your costs down and satisfy all the insurance requirements.  In the end the colors match, the job looks like uou never had a problem. Thank you Steve Wyatt and crew.< /Text>

<review>In January my mom and I were just leaving Taco Bell when we were rear-ended at a stop light. We exchanged information with the driver of the other car and shortly thereafter we were in need of some body repairs on my mom's Chevy S-10 pickup and the first place I called was Hild Collision Center after doing some research on line, boy am I glad I did because not only are they good, they check for any possible problem that might not be seen unless it's checked thoroughly.... They found damage to the bed of the pickup that we weren't aware of.... I found the experience I had at Hild Collision Center was exemplary in courtesy, knowledge and experience I would recommend them to anyone that needs autobody repair!! 💓💓<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My jeep compass went there for repair work through insurance (needed the front passenger side repaired) and at times of pick up my jeep wasn't finished window seal wasn't in properly, plastic for door wasn't completely fastened, the grill was missing hardware, now has extra scratches all the way around the body, extra parts were left in the car. They seemed very professional but I don't feel my vehicle was properly taken care of< /Review>

Great place but my bumper is still a bit crooked. It’s ok though because they repainted the entire side of my truck bed where the small dent was. Great place to go for collisions.< /text>

These guys rock! Had a bad experience  with Miller Auto.  They messed up my paint job and didn't want to fix it, so I took  it to Hild. . They fixed it fast and for free. 10 stars!!!< /review>

The person cutting my hair did not speak much English at all. The cut was totally wrong - not even close to what I asked for. At least it looked ok... Overpriced as well...< /review>

Great hair cut. Overall a very pleasant experience.  I was greeted immediately and was offered water or a complimentary beer. I chose the mystery beer. My wait was short.  Little Vee who cut my hair paid a lot of attention to detail.  The hot towel was a very enjoyful touch.  I left looking great and feeling great.  Definitely will be coming back.< /Review>

Always a great group of stylists.  Vee is my favorite but they are all good.  TVs, comfy chairs, and beverages.  What more could you want with a great haircut!?<//text>

< Review>
I think this is the best Barbershop in Santee. I've been to moose's in town center but HD is better in my opinion. Free beer, water, or juices for the kids.

They have really good barbers. I've had mine and my kids haircut here. Our best haircuts are by Dom and G. I'll pay the extra and tip better for a better haircut.

Worth it.<//Review>

Ive been going to HD for a couple of years now. At one point there was a barber there who I felt was an absolute negative to what the shop should be all about. I even stopped going for a bit. Now that HD has let that guy go, I am once again committed to his shop. Brian, V. And HD himself are great people and do an awesome job at cutting hair. I recommend calling ahead and making an appt. otherwise this place gets crazy busy on Sat. and Sun. They are always friendly and thorough and don’t cut any corners when it comes to customer satisfaction. They provide free water and for those of us adults a complimentary beer always hits the spot during a cut. Give this place a try, you won’t regret it. The pricing is right and they make sure you are satisfied with your cut before you leave. Thanks again HD for running an awesome and honest local business!< /Text>

The shop is clean and setup well even a play area for the kids to wait. The TV's will keep you entertained if you don't doze off. My son put me on to this place, and I'm glad he did.<//review>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I moved to Santee not too long ago and was in need of a barber. I am not familiar with Santee so I relied on Google reviews which led me to this barber shop. I don’t ever write reviews but my experience was so great I had to. As I walked in I was greeted and felt welcome and the facility is super clean to include complimentary water and beer(21 and over) and big screen TVs and also a kids play area. I had my hair cut by Vee, she was great and did an amazing job. She had outstanding attention to details. I  highly recommend this place to everyone. I myself will be coming back from here on out! I am very pleased and happy with my cut. Thank You Vee and HD Barbershop!< /text>< Pics>

<Text>One sad thing about moving to Santee was that I had a barber in my old area that is the best. I tried several shops in Santee and was not having good luck, until I found HD! Finally got a proper fade and STELLAR service. Vee cut my son first, and when I saw the good job on him I knew this was going to be a good experience overall. My cut came out great, and the beard trim/hot towel shave was on point. Great attention to detail, glad to have finally found a solid shop close to home! Bonus: they utilize Venmo as a payment option, very convenient!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>HD Barbershop is awesome. I highly recommend it to anyone. Everytime I walk out the door, I feel great and I get the perfect cut I am looking for. It is very clean inside and has alot of character. I enjoy the environment. If you appreciate the small things then you will enjoy the comfortable seats and good music that is played. The staff are friendly and professional. Also, I really like their use of compressed air to blow off the loose hair. I always hated getting a haircut and then having annoying hair on my neck and down my shirt. But at HD's I never have to worry about that. If you are looking for a barbershop, give them a try. HD does it right!</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Found this place next to where I get my nails done...glad I did. They do a great job and didnt make me feel intimidated to bring my son in by loud music like other barber shops, and now my husband goes too.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80d95802eef723eb:0x90ad2a6e240a745e<//gmap_id><user_id>114238897210664428270< /user_id>< response>

<text>Nice wine selection, and the wine sales associate will help you select something good for a good price. Good selection of organic produce. We're vegan so we were happy to see lots of nice vegetables and fruit, as well as some variety of tofu and other vegan packaged products.< /text>< username>

They want you to self check everything. The store services many elderly people and having them self check everything is time consuming and a giant hassle. For example-I saw a women yesterday in the self check line with a bag of sugar got had a cut in it the two men working the front then continued to talk and she asked if they could get another one. The responded go ahead.... I was dumbfounded... I worked as a bagger boy when I was 14 I would have never said that. A child has more manners. Shame on you Ralph’s.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

The checkers are always nice to deal with too. Big John in the deli makes great sandwiches that we eat on the beach.

< Review>
Just moved to Carlsbad after two years living overseas. We were excited to get back to our original favorites - Costco, Trader Joe’s, and Whole Foods. We’ve tried them all and other grocery store in the area but this quickly became our favorite. The prices, variety, and quality are unmatched. The staff we interacted with were very friendly.<//Review>

If it was possible for ZERO stars I'd rate them for that. Got told I was required to wear a mask to enter the store while I see 3 people walk out with no masks on F this Ralph's will be calling their corporate number to complain. Trash communism company!<//review>

Great supermarket. They did a huge renovation and greatly expanded the selections. There is a wide variety of cheeses. Good selection of produce including organic. Wide choice of wines and liquor. Large selection and variety of fresh flowers. Very helpful staff.<//review>

I have no idea why anyone would go to Vons instead of Ralphs. It is so much cheaper to shop here, there is more food to choose from, and there is a clearance section. They are not far from each other, yet people still refuse to see the greatness that is Ralphs. I have a friend that prefers Vons over Ralphs, and I really don't understand why. Everything here is just great. Very good place to buy food. Also, the receipts aren't extremely long, which saves paper.< /text>

<Review>This was everything you might expect in a Ralphs Supermarket and so much more. It also had kitchen appliances, cooking tools, kitchenware and bakeware that were all wonderfully arranged. The store was immaculate and the produce was fresh. It also had a large fresh seafood section which was impressive. This is a high end store that has been thoughtfully put together with the customer in mind.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating><Date>1558803013235< /Date><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>None< /pics>< user>

Have always shopped at Ralphs.  Being 75 years old, I wanted to start delivery or pickup for my groceries.  The website was almost impossible (and I have worked on computers for 20+ years) and guess what--there are no times listed for pick up or delivery.  They are booked and there was no place to sign up for future deliveries.  So basically, I wasted a hour doing my grocery list online and now I have to go shopping anyway.  And senior shopping from 7 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. is ridiculous.  We don't get up until 7 a.m.  We have compromised immune systems and no desire to go to the market at this point.  I will shop elsewhere.  But thanks for the memories.</Review>

<Review>The employees are all awesome and they work very hard. Added self checkout Lanes usually has only one lane open. Lots of customers   are unhappy.  Wait time is longer. You can't take a full cart through self checkout, it's ridiculous.  I used to love this place.  Not too happy since the changes.<//Review></record>

<Review>This store was fantastic, but they ruined it by closing all but 1 checkout lanes and forcing everyone into the self checkout.  After shopping at this store for 15 years we've had enough and go to Vons or Gelson's now.  The inconvenience of the drive is more palatable than the inconvenience of the self checkout, which completely sucks.</Review>< resp>

<text>I am a regular customer at Ralph's Twin Oaks Valley Road across the street from CSU San Marcos. I came here today to grab a salad for a party at a friend's house in Carlsbad. I have to say that considering the affluent neighborhood, the store is dirty and unkempt. The floors were grimy and black, the checkout belts filthy. I will definitely rethink my shopping options in Carlsbad next time.< /text>< Time>

Nice people! One person working the ENTIRE Deli, Pizza and all hot foods area during the busy late afternoon. I was in the store and hour...never saw another....even the  deli manager walked right by me without asking if I needed help. Done.
Salad bar was an embarrassment. Kidney beans right out of a can without rinsing. Thick and gushy. Peas out of a can, green brown and mushy (use frozen peas). Sliced radishes browning and curling up. They need to be in water. Sliced celery disgustingly green and brown....other customers agreed on all points. I'll stick with Lazy Acres salad bar. Always out of my favorite bread that I must get at Stater Bros or Vons instead. So bummed,  because I really do like the store. Not going anytime soon now. :(<//review>

We bought a 1/4 sheet cake, marble, with buttercream frosting for $18.99. Tonight, we had literally one bite and it was so bad we threw the whole cake in the garbage. 1 BITE! It tasted like combination of chemicals and like it was spoiled. It is cake! With buttercream! How anyone can make a cake taste that bad I have no clue but they managed to do it. So bravo to them.<//Text>< pictures>

Sadly Ralph's has become too "modern." I no longer get ads from them, now we're supposed to use their app; but that doesn't easily tell me what is on sale. I used to go there a lot, but now not so much.</Review>

It's a very Lovely Store.  However , the acting Manager Sisto at the time is rude, ignorant and ill-knowledgeable of a simple policy.  He was not going to seek out  any information either.  He just stood there to make me look uncomfortable.  He is an idiot.  He over talked me and he spoke too loudly, he fronted me off in front of others.  I just quietly walked away.< /text>

<text>I have been a loyal shopper for may years at Ralphs. The selections are good, the store well stocked and the help is always courteous. But I cant stand the DOGS in and around my food. Two weeks ago, I saw an owner yank his dog away when he started to lift his hind leg. Yesterday, I saw a lady with two dogs in her grocery cart. Stop this madness. NO DOGS IN THE MARKET!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>The staff is courtious, but the store Director is a PIP! I've never seen a Manger berate a employee publically in the manner this lady does. I grew up in retail, and my father would have fire this woman on the spot for treating the employees in the manner she does. Ralphs would be better off with out her.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I usually come here for dry goods, but they also have a good selection of produce and meats. If you're looking for a particular cut of meat though, you might want to come early to make sure you find it.  I usually am unable to buy beef shank here coz it's gone whenever I visit.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dc732bc40d1c17:0xea9cd95428e322d6</gmapID></record>

receipts they print out are virtually unreadable, besides the print element leaving gaps;
they show full price then make as many as 3 & 4 adjustments while not showing or hiding the eventual price you're being charged;
add that to a rude clerk and
today
this normally tolerable shopping experience went bad</text>

While most of the post about the carts were valid the blame was made on a company that has nothing to do with parking lot it resides in. Many parking lots are privately and separately owned by a business. Yes the parking lot does not have many cart drop-off" locations, but the problems are on the customers, and the parking lot owner, not Ralph's. The owner has hired a guard to help with the rule breakers (it's privately owned, that's why there is no smoking in the food court, get over it you smokers)

I have found that the people in that particular area of Carlsbad make no attempt to place the carts near or in the cart areas. The locals enjoy placing them right next to your vehicle so it can be damaged. They don't even find an empty space, I watched a man driving a nice BMW slam his cart in to mine, and left his trash in the cart and even on the ground. All the customers care about is themselves. The parking lot consists of one way lanes yet the customers go the wrong way, and speed. Yes the locals speed like mad, blow through the stops (clearly marked on the ground), nearly hit a few people, only to get a cup of coffee at Starbucks. The sad thing is that these "wrong doers" are adults. NOT KIDS, they are aged from 30+ and have an air of self entitlement. I avoid the  store just because of the customers.

Now about the store. The store is absolutely beautiful. The prices are a little high, yes, but we are in Carlsbad, not Chula Vista. The staff was nice, and the cashier, treated my son and I wonderfully (maybe because we had the same name?) THE BATHROOMS WERE EMMACULATE!!! I didn't feel like I had the risk of getting some STD's just while using them! It's a shame i have to give it 4 stars. It's all due to the citizens of Carlsbad.< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very good place to look for organic products, flowers, beverage, dairy, household items. Excellent care of its workers, went with some friends who did not know English, but the cashier was very kind to us that gave quick service.

(Original)
Muy buen lugar para buscar productos orgánicos, flores, bebidas, lácteos, artículos para el hogar. Excelente atención de sus trabajadores, fui con unos amigos que no sabían inglés, pero el cajero fue muy amable con nosotros por que dió un servicio rápido.< /Text></record>

I was gifted a fossil watch for my high school graduation and never owned a watch before but I loved it (wore it almost everyday). I needed a new strap as part of mine broke. The manager was so nice to me and gave me a card so I could come back with the watch and see about getting it replaced. I ended up going home and coming right back. Customer service was great and I will be able to pick up a replacement next week.</text><user>117822959419602947287< /user>< Gmap_id>

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. I was helped by Alex and he was willing to spend time with me to make sure that I was getting the right watch. I have purchased several watches from this store over the years and Alex was one of the most helpful people I've ever worked with at Fossil. That being said, I've never had a bad experience at this store, the entire staff is amazing.< /text>

After having some issues with the screen on my gen 5 smart watch, I walked in the store, was greeted by Ben who helped me out, not many questions asked and my watch was still under warranty so they just swapped it out for a brand new one!<//text>

Courtney is the best! She has excellent customer service and cares about the customer. My only complaint is that she makes me want to come spend more money. Hahaha. Seriously though thanks Courtney for being so great. My girlfriend walked out saying how she wanted to hug her because she is so nice.</text>

I walked in thinking i knew what i wanted and when i realized i didnt know he spent over 2 hours helping me get exactly what i needed, which turned out to be the most amazing graduation gift for my future husband! Thank you so much Colby!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Great Customer Service & Products

I am always greeted with a smile and an employee always makes it a point to offer assistance within 30 seconds of me walking in the store., without being too "pushy".
The employees are very knowledgably about the available products and are quick to detail all the cool new features.
After deciding to purchase an item the employees will offer to engrave the product, if available, and detail the services offered for cleaning and repairing at little to no cost.
I have purchased fossil watches, purses and wallets over the years and every single item is in impeccable condition. I highly recommend this store and Fossil watches, purses and wallets.</review>

No customer service. My daughter gave me a nice Fossil watch for Christmas. The watch band is tight and needs a link added. We went to the Roseville Galleria store where it was purchased. They said contact customer service. We did and so far no links (2/20/2017). If something is wrong or broken with a watch, the store will do nothing. Contacting customer service is a waste of time.</Text>

<text>This place is amazing! I bought my "Caddy" 6 mos ago. I stopped in to get a little help with all of my new "gadgets". My salesman Philip happened to be there. He remembered who I was. LOVE this! Now THAT'S what I call customer service! Yup, they will have me as a customer for many years!<//text>< Pics>

Extremely poor customer service when it comes to helping you save any money at all on service, especially after market service. Have a cross threaded oil pan? Their recommendation, replace the whole thing, have a leaky gasket on your radiator? They will sell you a whole new radiator. Be prepared if you go in for a simple oil change to be presented with 2-6 thousand in optional repairs to make you feel great the rest of the week.</Review>

Waiting room chairs are too low for anyone over 19 years of age. Very uncomfortable. We waited at least 2 hours for a new remote and key to be programmed to vehicle . No one came to check how we were doing periodically< /text>

Penske Buick GMC treated me very professionally. They took care of my car's issue, thoroughly. Everyone said, " Hello" and/or asked if I had been helped. I received updates via text and email. Payment for the service received handled while I was seated. I didn't have to walk to a different location. Overall, go check Penske Buick GMC out!<//review>

There wasn't any pressure to buy anything, as we were there just to look, and they respected that. There also wasn't a discussion about pricing, but I would give them an opportunity in the future if I decided to buy a vehicle from them.</review>< pictures>

I receive top notch service. My service rep is very thorough in his explanation of what is in need of service and what it will cost. The waiting areas are comfortable offer a variety of refreshments and of course the car wash is well done too. I leave with a smile on my face!</text>

Horrible company, don't return calls nor give a hoot about anyone.  They actually cop an attitude when you call to request from them status of your repair.  I guess they feel we are stuck with them for repairs  and service so why bother.  Rediculliois way of doing business!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Large showroom and kind manager,
A large maintenance factory, the largest parts center in the area, is a dealer who can handle. There were too many luxury cars in the US and I was overwhelmed.

(Original)
広いショールームと親切なマネージャー、
大きな整備工場、エリア最大のパーツセンター完備で、対応してくれるディーラーさんです。アメリカの高級車がありすぎて圧倒されました。< /text>

Great place for short walks, fishing or just hanging out. parking is free and it is always windy. We always go there to spend the evenings just to enjoy nature. It has an interesting history.<//review>

One of the place I visited after the fishing spree was on. you do not need any permit to fish here because of it being a public pier. People told to go there for Basses and Sturgeons. We got both of their kinds, along with some other marine lives. While writing this, it reminded that the current pandemic stole away the fun of fishing too.<//text>

The Dumbarton Bridge has many different trails on either side one side has the Dumbarton Pier not many Fisherman's but really nice views of our Bay and there's a a trail that goes around the ponds The Saltwater ponds tons of peace and quiet out there if you like to go for a run or ride and you don't want to see many people I definitely recommend the trails around the Dumbarton very secluded definitely recommend checking this place out<//Review>

With gate closed, you will need a bike to get to the pier as it's a distance. The path to the pier is parallel to the freeway and can be noisy and you can smell the exhaust. Once there, you will have the pier to yourself.< /review>

Wonderful place to take pictures. You can fish from the pier without need of a license but you still need one for bank fishing.</text>

Beautiful place to go in the evenings. Great views across the bay towards Palo Alto. The sun sets behind the bridge from the pier. Access is free as is parking. About 200 meters from the start of the pier is a large passage that allows access to the other side of hwy 84 giving you views across the bay towards San Francisco. From there you see the the sunset behind the coastal hills.
Go on one of the mixed clouds and sky days after the rain in the winter for spectacular sunset’s.
From this point you could walk almost to Berkeley along the salt pond levies.
Many coastal dwelling birds for the bird watchers.
At the beginning of the road to the pier are wonderful marshy areas you can explore. All in all a hidden gem in our neighborhood. NOTE:  never go in the exit lane if you get there late. SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE from one way spikes in the road.</Review>

Bring a jacket for the winds. Nice walk down the pier and you can see the local fisherman getting their fish. Plenty of seating benches along the pier.<//review>

The most interesting thing that caught my attention was the uniquely designed bench seat, which is fully embraced by high concrete walls except the ocean-facing side. Thus an angler could sit in comfortably for hours, without being blown by the gusty wind. Amazing!<//review>< Rate>

Hidden pier next to Dumbarton bridge. You don’t need a license to fish off the pier and you can use 2 rods per person. Last time we went we caught bat ray. Have heard you can also catch sharks off the pier</Review>

I’m really disappointed in puppy spot. Our dog was flown out from Oklahoma and arrived extremely timid. We believe he was treated badly on the flight. It may also be the breeding of the dog.  He is now 11 months old  and has grown out of some of it through a ton of training and work. He came with giardia and parasites have been an ongoing issue. The amount of money we have put into him for cost flying out and vet bills is incredible. Several times we thought of placing him but decided to stick with it and he is finally working out. My advise would be to not buy a dog unseen. Pictures and the word of a breeder is not enough and any guarantees I would not trust. AGAIN SEE WHAT YOU ARE GETTING.</text>

We got our Goldendoodle through PuppySpot after searching local breeders that had 6-12 mos waiting lists. PuppySpot was great, Because we could search the size and color and generation that we were looking for easily on the app. We had the puppy we wanted within a matter of weeks, Instead of placing a deposit and wondering if the puppy that you want will be available in six months to a year. He is the perfect addition to our family! Very happy and healthy! The cons of going through puppy spot is that you pay more for the convenience, and they could definitely improve on some of the communication during the waiting process. But overall, it was very smooth, and we got a wonderful puppy that we would not have otherwise found. Would use them again!< /Text>

The site was very informative on my puppy and they called to follow up with updates before my puppy arrived. I had to have my puppy delivered and the driver ran late, but he called me along the way to let me know at all times where he  was and how he was progressing. I could not have ask for a better pup. The first few days was rough but expected with a pup that was stressed with a new environment. I liked the fact that they do guarantee there pups to be healthy. I would highly recommend Poppy Spot for your new fur baby.<//review>

PuppySpot was fantastic from start to finish!  I was hesitant doing it because giving payment for a puppy and not seeing him in person seemed risky.  I can 100% tell you it was the best experience ever. Tucker just turned 1 year  old yesterday and I couldn't be happier!  I am so grateful and love this puppy with all my heart.  Thank you PuppySpot!!<//Review>

Ordered my baby in the beginning of covid.  He was transported for five days all the way from North Dakota.  Puppy spot, and the transporter kept me touch every day. He arrived very happy and healthy..but needing a bath!  I have had many dogs and he is perfect…healthy, great personality and now the joy of my life. Chance just turned one. ( Chance because I was taking a chance on him)<//text>

Great Experience we got to look for a dog that O could not find locally.  The service included information and pictures of the parents health ratings including genetic tests and pictures.
We had to wait for transport for a bit but it was worth it to know we were getting the puppy of our dreams.</Text>

I have two happy, healthy, hilarious bulldogs that I purchased through PuppySpot roughly three years ago (they are 5 months apart in age).  They came from two different breeders and both arrived safely and healthy - they were easy to train and have very sweet dispositions and are great entertainers. They have transformed our family life for the better and bring us joy every day. Sure, you pay a bit more for the service, but PuppySpot is doing all the legwork for you and my two are more than worth the cost. I could not be happier with my two best friends.<//Review>

{'time': 1629910494482, 'text': "Isadora - We were truly shocked to receive your review, as not only is it the polar opposite of the experience the vast majority of our customers report having, it varies drastically from the detailed notes and recorded calls we have on file. We consider ourselves to be more than a service, rather a community, and we would never disrespect any member of our community. Your puppy, like all PuppySpot puppies, underwent a mandated nose-to-tail health examination administered by a licensed veterinarian, in order to ensure that your puppy was as healthy as possible right before we cleared her travel home to you. It's our policy to disclose any issues found during this examination, no matter how minor, as was the case in your situation. We were able to communicate with you via phone and email (which included pictures) as soon as we received the health examination results to relay the results and asked that you reply to a follow-up email confirming you were comfortable welcoming home your pup, which you stated you were not. At that point, our team went ahead and issued a full refund. Although our relationship has come to an end, we wish you the very best in your search for a new furry family member."}<//response>
< Review>
We have been for a month planning to welcome Opal, a cockapoo. We paid for her a lot of money. The app was grooming us on how to proceed, how to welcome our new family member. We've even made a crate, like it was a newborn. My son, was waiting for his first puppy for his 10 years-old birthday.
Then 2 days before her flight to us, we heard the news of one Opal's physical problem. And then from there no solutions. A senior supervisor with only one name Carmen or Cameron or Carmon (no last name given even after we asked for one) called us and from the beginning of the phone-call  he had a defensive and condescending attitude. We didn't want to talk to him, we wanted to have solutions from Brad our first puppy manager, but he told us there was no other person to talk to, he really was not helpful, in fact it seemed he didn't want us to have a puppy, since the first minute he said they would refund our money. And they did. They refunded our money right away. We tried to get her back, willing to pay the surgical problems, but nothing. They didn't care about us.
They broke their promise they advertised so much.

I really advise you NOT to use this heartless company, with no skills for customer service.

I wish there was a ZERO in the ratings.</Review>

<text>My husband and I bought Quincy, a male Maltese, in the Fall of 2016.  At that time I gave 3 Stars, because Quincy arrived with infected, dirty ears, and because the breeder had never trained him at all, not even to a leash though he was already 4 1/2 months old.  Now I am happy to tell you that he is a wonderful and much loved family member.  Ears weren’t hard to heal, and he is smart and affectionate.  He still doesn’t care for a leash, but we helped that by getting an invisible fence around the yard.  He was very easy to train to this with just sound and lowest vibration (no shocking ever) and is very mindful of his boundaries and never strays.  I will also note that he was not promised to be 100% Maltese, and the price reflected that.  I suspected he had some amount of small poodle, and recent DNA test showed he is 86% Maltese and the rest small poodle.  My granddaughter loves him too. I couldn’t love him more.   Thank you Puppy Spot.</text>< user_id>

After several delays we finally received our puppy.
At her first required vet visit she was found to have parasites.
She was treated with medication and after a second round of meds
she seems ok.  Now I'm trying to get reimbursed for my expenses as per
their contract and they've asked several times for records that I've given them twice.  I don't know what the problem is.  The records are very clear.
After many phone calls this is taking too much of my time.  I spent a lot of money for this puppy  and this is trying my patience.<//Review>

-The concierge was nice (Keefe) before I pushed the final payment, once the payments completed he stop respond to my email.

-The help team at puppy spot respond to my calls and answer all my questions, I'd give them a good credit on that.

-We canceled the adoption because one of the family households got Covid-19 and likely we all gonna get it, I did attach a copy from the medical report explaining the reason for cancellation,  the team didn't show any kind of empathy, they did refund the money minus $495 cancellation fee. I believe fees are unreasonable since we inform the puppy spot about the current situation before the puppy reaches 8weeks old.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

PUPPYSCAM!!!!!  I tried to buy a Pomeranian puppy through puppyspot and got a mixed breed.  I had him DNA tested and the test showed he was part Pomeranian and part Besenji.  I had to send the puppy back to the breeder myself to get the situation resolved.  But even with that I did not get any money back from this company.

Original payment for  Benny (Puppy ID 506516) $2,649.00
Vet examination, $85.77
DNA Test, $64.98
Flea treatment 2 treatments $35.29 pack of 3 0.66667, $23.53
Royal Canin Dog Food $37.99 per bag, 2 bags, $75.98
Examination and Health certificate and Rabies shot from Vet, $91.45
Air Waybill and Pet Shipping to Tulsa, $287.94
Total $3,278.65

NO MONEY BACK and NO DOG!!!!!!

They say they are an advocate for the buyer.  They helped the buyer cheat me.  NOT PUPPYSPOT.....  PUPPY SCAM!!!!!!!!

DO NOT USE!!!!!  DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!

I will post photos of him. He is a very cute puppy but clearly is not a Pomeranian.  The black dog is the mix breed the red is a pure breed.  The last photo is a photo of s Besenji, you can clearly see where he got his shape and marking from.

$3,278.65  and no dog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /review>

They would provide all of the information about the puppy and immediately forced you to pay for the amount with extra payment for the delivery but after upon the contract signing and payment i haven’t recieved any news from you guys.

Tried to contact several times and the girl helping me was very rude and unprofessional.

I just want to know if i could get the puppy that i atleast buy or if ever it is gonna get delivered to my place?

I pay up for nothing.< /Review>

Expensive and puppy came with mites, yeast ear infection and giardia.

We had been trying to get a puppy from independent breeders for months without success. We finally decided to go with puppyspot. The price is obviously 3-4 times more, however, they brought our puppy to our door, which was great! Our puppy has brought so much joy to our family. Now for the negatives: Puppyspot says their puppies are healthy. I have been to the vet already six times since the puppy arrived. Found out he has mites, and really bad yeast infection in his ears. He has been on ear drops for weeks and the infection still has not completely cleared. Then the poop sample showed giardia. We are now treating him for that. We have spent close to $1000 on vet bills in three weeks. My question is, when our puppy was given a clean bill of health and approved for travel, did their vet look in his ears? This degree of ear infection should not have been missed.

I left this review on trustpilot and Puppyspot had my review removed.</text>

<Review>I think PuppySpot is great.  I got my last 2 puppies from them.  I got a Chihuahua puppy in 2016 and just got another Chihuahua puppy a week ago.  I find them most helpful, keep you posted on your puppies progress and both of my puppies have been all that I could imagine.   I feel they truly do vet their breeders and even though puppies seem expensive, you pay for quality, and my puppies have been just that.  Most places that don’t charge much are either scams or the puppies come from a puppy mill and tend to be sick and expensive when you get them with vet bills. I’d rather pay a little more and get a beautiful, healthy puppy.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I had to say that this company is a full of scam.
They didn't care about the customer, All they care is the money. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone and to students just like me.
All the publicity and 5 star reviews is all fake.
I don't wanna give a one star if only i could put negative 1 on this review.
I just bought a beagle puppy with the contract says includes the shipping.
After the payment due to what they say that bad or impulsive weather they just left a box with the pup in it. The shipping center says they can't accept it without the dog crate.
The manager of the shipping center called me to pay up another 1,500 and sended me an email which looks like a fake email for a shipping center.
This is not included in our contract.
It states on the contract that the seller is gonna be the one who will do the shipping not the buyer which is me. Upon my cancellation they didn't even provide any refund.
This is 100% Scam and Unprofessional Company.
They even tried to delete their email but luckily i screenshot the whole thing. Please do not buy from this website.< /Review>

Worst experience ever, was told a week ago my dog would be here between 12-4, 4 comes around no dog. I call they say time changed to 6. 6 came, no dog. It’s now the next day and nobody has answered their phones and I have no update on my extremely expensive dog. Never been so disappointed in a company. This took away any good experience you should have when buying a puppy. Am I even getting my dog????< /Text>

"Caution- Do not buy from them"
Please don't get a new companion from here. First their dogs are extremely expensive which we never cared but one of the most important thing is they all lie.
When I got my beagle puppy last year, the website information, their staff and even the breeder told us that the dog will weigh maximum  15-18 lbs and they only sell pure breed dogs.
My dog who is 1 and a 1/2 years old weighs 42 lbs, he's super hyper not a lazy dog at all always extremely active. I have cut down his food since he turned 8 months, no table scrapping, make him exercise everyday, despite this my dog is still growing and growing. I got my puppy thinking it will be ok with the apartment conditions of keeping a dog upto 25 lbs. But because of their lie I had to switch place, I love my puppy hes my family but these people tell you all lies for selling a dog. Since he weighs 42 lbs now we came to know that my dog is not a pure breed beagle he's a mix of beagle and a hound. But I was told this is a pure breed beagle. Very very disappointing.
Attached is the pick, my beagle puppy with his brother....

Update..now my puppy will be 3 years in December and he weights 46lbs and just now the banfield told me that he has genetic disorder for arthritis...</text>

Puppyspot is an incredible company of employees who genuinely care about the dogs. I found my dog on their site last year and I am looking to get another one right now. I've been searching for a good company for forever and I'm glad that I've finally found the one. I must admit, some of the reviews made me question Puppyspot, but after going through the process and actually taking the time to understand the company, I can testify that anything under five stars is a lie. The biggest trend on some of the negative reviews is that the dog had a small health problem or that the prices were too high. Mine did not have a health problem, but even if he did, it wouldn't be a big deal. I hate to break it to you, but dogs (like humans) sometimes get sick. Puppyspot takes their dogs' health extremely seriously and requires all dogs to receive a veterinarian check before they leave the breeder.  Plus, if there are any major health problems, the company pays for all the medical care. The people at Puppyspot love these dogs and the Puppy concierge who spoke to me told me that Puppyspot would take the dog and re-home him if I wasn't able to support him. I got the vibe that Puppyspot doesn't play games when it comes to the health of their puppies. In fact, in speaking with the concierge, I learned that the Puppyspot team actually examines individuals who want to buy their puppies to ensure that they are responsible owners. In short, they do not let just anyone receive a puppy, just like they deny 90% of all breeders who attempt to join Puppyspot and don't meet their high standard. The second major complaint (which I realised was a bit dumb) was that the prices were too high. Yes, Puppyspot does have some expensive dogs, but that is because they do not sacrifice on quality. What sold me, was that you are paying for the trust. I was able to trust that Puppyspot vetted all the breeders (Puppyspot denies 90% of the breeders who apply and has dedicated teams to drive all across the country and inspect breeders) and trust that all safety precautions were taken. If you need any last convincing, look at the leadership of this company. The executives hold degrees from Stanford, Duke, Michigan, and UPenn and a look at their social media pages illustrates their immense love for dogs. This company doesn't mess around and I am incredibly happy that I found them.< /Text>

<text>PuppySpot was great from beginning to end. I was so nervous because my husband purchased without really consulting me until after he had put down a down payment. I ended up paying the rest of the balance and then became their customer. After reading a lot of reviews I became even more concerned this was a scam. Boy, was I wrong! They are so professional and a great advocate for you between the breeder! They answered every question we had sometimes multiple in a day. They even had the breeder send more pictures of him when he got closer to coming home and a little bigger. The travel department arranged for an early morning flight and our breeder didn’t want to bring the puppy to the airport that early because it was too far away. We were beginning to get worried, but PuppySpot put her in her place for us. They basically told her to hold up her end of the deal and she knew she would have to drive that far no matter what because the plan had always been for the puppy to fly to our state. We’ve had our puppy for two weeks now and he is doing GREAT! He is the cutest and so intelligent - he can already sit and wait in a spot  on command! We did technically get our puppy a day late because they fly standby when with a nanny (which ours was since he had to fly in cabin to be able to come to Phoenix in the summer), but they had fully warned us this could happen. We were upset at first, but PuppySpot worked really hard to get our puppy to us ASAP. I would recommend this company if your looking for a specific breed for a specific purpose (working ranch dog or a service dog).</text>< time>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>I am reading many reviews and have gone through the same.  I never received any type of response when I reached out via phone text email or their app. The day my dog traveled they found me and then alerted me on a separate call 10 minutes later that she would not be able to travel because she had some disease from drinking bad water and that the vet has an approved her. I then asked when she would be ready or how much time they would need and Sarah my PuppySpot advisor said that it’s going to cost the company a lot of money and kept repeating that and said she had no information.

Long story short do not buy from here at any cost. It’s overpriced and nothing short of a scam.< /review>< Date>

If you buy a dog, regardless from where, a perfectly healthy, living dog dies in a shelter. Sickening that this business promotes the problem, not the solution.
Any breed, any age, you can adopt from a shelter or a rescue.
Be a good person, don’t ever buy!! Disgraceful!!!< /Review>

If finding a purebred or purpose-bred designer puppy or knowing your new family member's health and behavioral history are important to you, PuppySpot is likely the better choice for you as that information is not often available to you at a shelter. That being said, we are not anti-shelter in any way but, instead, pro-dog. As dog lovers, what is important to us is that people are able to make educated choices and find their dogs from a responsible, humane source, whether that source is a shelter, a rescue or a breeder. And, while there are many wonderful shelters and rescues out there, unfortunately, that is not always the case. Unlike responsible breeders, rescues and shelters are not typically licensed or regulated by the government and often operate without government oversight."}<//resp>

Puppy spot pays  their customers to keep quiet about sick/dead puppies.  Clearly they are not puppy mill free.  Just check official complaints and dispositions online.  After weeks of research, I'm re-convinced that i have to do the hard work of visiting local reputable breeders and WAITING until the right match comes along.  Don't try to order a puppy online.  It is exactly as it appears...horrible for dogs and exploitative for both dogs and naive buyers,</Text>

Worst website. They over charge you. I was lucky enough to find the breeder for the puppy they had on their website that was marked up $1000 PLUS A "PICK UP FEE" TO PICK UP SAID PUPPY than from what the breeder was selling for directly. WORST PLACE TO BUY A PUPPY. Just check with breeders in your area its alway better to work with the breeder directly because  I got a dog that was priced $2450 but got the very SAME listed dog directly from the breeder by chance on their personal website for $800 plus a delivery fee of $300 to bring them TO ME. This place is aweful, its like a car dealership for dogs. DO NOT BUY HERE.< /Review>

The day my dog arrived she had an infection on her belly, a upper respiratory infection along with a few fresh wounds. This company only cares about the profit they make and not the dogs themselves. I was not re-embursed for my dog’s health issues upon her arrival as promised and every time I have requested assistance from this company they have changed their original promise and failed with the treatment of my puppy. I would recommend looking deeper into the company and verify that what they say about having responsibile breeders and not puppy milling since I definitely have had the opposite in my case.< /review>

{'time': 1543348644158, 'text': "Jeffrey - We are sorry for your frustrating experience and we are disappointed to learn that you have such a negative impression of PuppySpot. Our top priority is always the health and well-being of our puppies, period. That is why your puppy came from a pre-screened breeder who met our high standards, and PuppySpot absolutely does not tolerate substandard breeding of any kind. Your puppy's breeder followed our mandated health and vaccination protocols, and your puppy underwent an extensive nose-to-tail health exam from a licensed veterinarian, which she passed and was in no way falsified, before coming home to you. That is why we were shocked and concerned when we learned that your puppy was not feeling well shortly after she arrived. As soon as you notified us of your puppy’s conditions, our team was quick to reach out to learn more and see how we could help.\nWe always stand behind our puppies and health guarantee, which is why we offered to cover your vet bills associated with treating your puppy with proper documentation. You then expressed you were reluctant to continue to care for your puppy and that is when we made arrangements for your puppy to return to her breeder and offered you a full refund. You then decided that you wanted to keep your puppy and at this point we went ahead and refunded you for the associated vet costs for your pups treatment for diarrhea.\nPuppySpot is a community and we will continue to be here for you and your pup, every step of the way."}<//resp>

<Text>I want to make this as detailed as possible to hopefully alleviate some of the fear and anxiety that I experienced for anyone who decides to go ahead with this company. I read a bunch of reviews on Google, Yelp, Puppyspot and BBB that were a mix bag, but those bad reviews were what I focused on, unfortunately, while I waited for my puppy to arrive. I wish I would have had more faith that everything would work out...because it absolutely did!

It took me 8 years to be ready to adopt another Pomeranian. I lost my little Rylie and he was my first baby, my first dog, my first "child," so it was a great loss that took time to get over. When I first started looking, I checked breeders in the area. Most the puppies were either adopted right away, or you had to put a deposit down for a dog that you couldn't even tell what it was going to look like and these pups were a minimum of $1500 each for that breed. Because of the fore mentioned issues and upfront cost, going through someone locally was out of the question for me. I did a lot of researching of PuppySpot prior to deciding to adopt from them. I looked for the right puppy for weeks then found my little "Lane." He was the perfect looking, the right price and I was even able to finance him, without that option I wouldn't have been able to get a Pomeranian at all. I do realize the cost is much more expensive than going elsewhere, but I, like all their other customers, know that going in and I don't understand why anyone would complain after they committed to paying the, yes inflated, but fully disclosed cost of their new puppy. I put my $99.00 deposit down and signed the contract. I am billed by checking account draft, bi-weekly on my paydays.

I was expecting for my puppy to arrive 9 days later on a Wednesday. After 2 days, I was told the option of flying in my puppy to Phoenix was no longer available due to a "heat embargo" and he would have to fly in to Flagstaff (4 hours each way). I told them that was not an option and I could not travel that far to pick up the puppy. They then called me back and told me it would just be another $200 and they could send him ground transportation to have him there a week later, arriving between Tuesday and Thursday. I got angry at that point and told them that I am not committing one more dime to getting this dog (I already rolled in $399 to my financing to fly him in) and they can cancel my account if that's the only option. They then put a Manager on and he calmed me down and told me they would take care of the ground cost. I agreed.

They let me know to download the PuppySpot app that you can converse with your Puppy Manager, see pics of your puppy and see the info about the pups parents, etc. I requested pictures that I received within 72 hours and thought that he looked a little sickly in them, so I requested a video to see him that he was in fact active and healthy, which I got a day later. The videos put my mind at ease. He was spunky and apparently happy and well taken care of by the breeder. It was obvious he lived inside in a warm, clean, loving environment.  My arrival date did get pushed back to Friday, but that wasn't a big deal. They always responded to my questions within a couple hours, if not right away, and I was super high maintenance with a bad attitude and a lot of mistrust, paranoia from continually reading the bad reviews, freaking my self out.

When the transport company picked him up, they sent a pic to let me know they had him. I was able to text the transport company and check on the baby during the 5 day trip.

When he arrived, he was smaller than I had anticipated from the pictures (3 lbs) and about ten times as cute! He was scared at first, but I gave him a bath and he warmed up to me, my boyfriend and our 18 week old Mini Aussie. The two puppies have been playing for 4 hours straight and his temperament is so sweet and playful. He is a gorgeous, perfect little guy and everything went wonderfully, no matter my reservations.

I DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING YOUR PUPPY AT PUPPYSPOT!<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWbtStxYh_FI-MnbxDCYL4xjw4_nco70mW4qWX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxC7g9SDTzdSJqQEuId1BoOH0B2UbA_x5aJ1T7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxYeRe2Sf_rGx_0KpgaE2WvArmZPC1wgnXbjxB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

One of the worst experiences our family has ever been through.  We purchased a Mini Goldendoodle that we named Wilson.  Our puppy arrived, sick, with parasites and a cough.  After countless visits to the vet, we were finally able to rid him of the parasites.  The company never followed up on reimbursing our expenses, as they promised.  From that point, the experience went even further downhill.  At six months, Wilson started viciously attacking our children-unprovoked.  He would go into a sudden rage and afterwards, he would seem remorseful. I again contacted PuppySpot and was told there was nothing they could do.  We spent thousands of dollars on trainers.  We paid a behaviorist who told us that even with behavior modification, the dog would potentially still attack.  She suggested that we DNA test the dog.  Turns out that he had as much Chihuahua DNA as Golden Retriever DNA.  Not what we expected, nor what we were told or sold.  After spending over ten thousand dollars on Wilson and his related issues, we ended up having to give the dog to the Behaviorist as a final attempt to provide him with a life, but at the same time to protect our children from further attack.  Throughout our unfortunate experience, I repeatedly asked to speak to the CEO or an officer of the company.  Regardless of the number of times I requested that action, it never happened.  With all the issues, money spent and most importantly the disappointment and harm my children emotionally and physically suffered because of the dog, to not get a return call from the leadership of PuppySpot is telling of the modus operandi and their lack of caring about their customer, product and reputation.</text>

<Resp>{'time': 1551910330064, 'text': "Mark - We are deeply saddened by your feedback, as it is the exact opposite of the experience we want any of our puppy parents to have. We were truly concerned when you initially contacted us about your pup's temperament. At that time our Customer Advocate's Manager quickly contacted you to learn more and see how we could help. You then expressed that you did not wish to keep your puppy. Our Manager explained our re-homing options and asked for the required supporting documentation from your pup's behaviorist, in which you personally acquired and agreed to send. Upon our follow-up regarding the documentation we had requested, you made us aware that you personally re-homed your pup with your behaviorist and no longer had the puppy in your possession. We have the best of intentions and we are a community of dog lovers who put the well being of our puppies above all else. We work hard to offer a trusted, transparent way of finding a furry family member and we never want our puppy parents to feel misled. Unfortunately, we were unable to further assist with the re-homing or DNA testing, as you re-homed your puppy without our help and against our advice. That said, we care deeply about our puppy parent community and wanted to help out any way that we could."}<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2ba290208b0ff:0xa2a077ee3dd5454a</gmapID></record>

<review>I got my Beagle in 3/2018 after few delays and cancellations.
I tested him and Vet.said has Giardia, put him on med. 5 different times saying it is very resistant to medication. I really got tired of treatment and expense every time I took him to Vet.
Popy Spot said they are healthy when we get them, it wasn't the case.
I even  not sure if he is mix with another Hund or realy pure.
His name is Tyson ( Shangool)<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1543512924012, 'text': "Iraj - It is our mission to place healthy puppies into happy homes, which is why we were surprised to learn your puppy has Giardia, a common and treatable puppyhood condition. Like all PuppySpot puppies, shortly before arriving home your pup underwent an extensive nose-to-tail health examination administered by a licensed veterinarian and concluded your pup was 100% healthy. As unfortunate as it is, puppies sometimes get sick, which is why we have a dedicated health team to help resolve any issues our puppy parents may have. We are also incredibly shocked and confused that you believed you did not receive a purebred Beagle. We take pride in the honest, responsible and trusted approach we use to help puppy parents meet their new furry best friend.  More than a quarter of our nearly 200 dog-loving team members are involved in our breeder screening and compliance efforts. And, the PuppySpot Breeder Compliance Team has a singular objective – to ensure we only work with the nation's highest-quality breeders. PuppySpot stays in regular contact with our breeder community and have members of our Breeder Compliance team in the field every week of the year. We are absolutely confident that your puppy is a purebred Beagle. Although we are confident that your new pup is indeed a purebred, it is important to us that you too, are positive that you received the exact puppy you requested. A team member has been trying to contact you to request updated photos of your pup and the medical invoices from your vet. We are really looking forward to speaking with you soon and most importantly, resolving your concerns."}</resp><GmapID>0x80c2ba290208b0ff:0xa2a077ee3dd5454a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

All shops that deliver bred puppies are the exact problem, 50% ofthose puppies statistically end up in the shelter and put to sleep.
Adopt a pet from a local shelter or rescue!<//review>
<Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1553633165048, 'text': "Caligirl - First and foremost - if you can adopt a dog from a shelter, you absolutely should. We believe every dog deserves a loving home. That said, while reputable rescues and shelters are a great option for some, it's not a great fit for everyone. If finding a purebred or purpose-bred designer puppy or knowing your new family member's health and behavioral history are important to you, PuppySpot is likely the better choice for you as that information is not often available to you at a shelter. As dog lovers, what is important to us is that people are able to make educated choices and find their dogs from a responsible, humane source, whether that source is a shelter, a rescue or a service like ours.\nPuppySpot works extremely hard on the front-end to ensure the health of our puppies, by not only thoroughly vetting our breeders but also screening every prospective puppy parent. The best way to end the burden upon shelters is responsible pet ownership. If one of our puppy parents is no longer able to care for a puppy for any reason at all, PuppySpot utilizes our rehoming program to find our furry family member a new happy home. While we rarely need to use this program, we have it in place to make sure we don't contribute to already burdened shelter and rescues out there working hard to help pups in need."}<//response>< Gmap_id>

I've been coming here for YEARS. they have huge selection for kids. 3 for 20. The shoes are decent. I will keep coming back when the kids need shoes for school or play.
Cute things for women sometimes. Depending on your style and taste. Mens shoes are nice. They have socks and boxers as well.< /review>

Nice selection, great place to find inexpensive shoes. As expected by the pricing though, they're not for heavy duty rough usage. Mine usually last over a year though, so they're totally worth it.</review>

Do they have three pairs for 20? Yes. Are they shoes you would actually want to buy? Mmm, not really!

I was looking for simple black shoes, something casual but not a sneaker. Finally found a pair in my size after my first 3 or 4 choices were sold out! And paid $15 for the one pair. But hey, they seem to be decent shoes and are holing up so far after light use.</Text>

<Review>It's got the air of a hole in the wall restaurant from the outside, but do not judge them by the exterior. it really does have the best Mediterranean food in the area. They have a vegetarian plate which is really just the sides grouped together as a single plate, so my vegetarian friends weren't overly impressed, but I love the lule, the kabobs, and the sides are super flavorful even if not filling by themselves. The salmon also got high marks from my friend. The prices are reasonable too.

It's in an industrial area where there aren't many comparable options nearby and the locals like this place so be prepared. If you get there at noon, you should get a table without too much trouble. Get there at 12:30 though and you might have to wait.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I love this place. Really good food and made quickly. Employees are very nice and thoughtful. You can order online, phone or just show up. Good amount of parking out front and lots of tables inside. I usually get the plates which come with two sides and on real hungry days add some extra protein.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1558019599412, 'text': "Thanks for your kind words and support, Jake!

This place it's great.  Unassuming from the outside but quite popular and busy inside. Authentic Armenian flavors and dishes.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The baby back ribs were cut, cooked, seasoned,  and sauced to perfection. Can't wait till I'm back there again. Was welcomed in by the staff immediately. Even with all the to-go orders, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.<//Review>

The servings are generous and the meat is delicious.  They tend to get pretty busy and do a lot of takeout business so sometimes the servers are pretty busy and can't get to you right away.

Service was good. Small portions for an $15 meal. Hummus was very bland. Oddly fries were good. Meat was really good (beef steak) so was the beef lule. Probably will try again.</text>

Mediterranean / Armenian food in a no frills environment. The meat is cooked well and attention is paid to the rice and sides. Great local workday lunch option if in the mood for kebabs. Parking is street parking but ample. But it should be understood that although the restaurant is clean and the service is prompt,  the ambience is no frills.<//text>

This little hideaway gem is a great place for some amazing Armenian food. Everything is cooked to perfections and great presentation. The staff is very friendly and provide wonderful service. Tends to get really busy during lunch hour, so try to get there a bit earlier if you want to have sit down lunch.</Review>

< Review>
A friend and I tried this little out-of-the way restaurant for dinner, mext to a marine repair shop. An add place for a restaurant, I thought. It was deserted the evening we went... not another customer in sight. Too bad, because the food was very good. While service was a little slow, the grape leaves, and chicken kabobs were delicious and the portions were generous. We also loved the eggplant caviar-- it was fresh-tasting and served cold, but with the great pita bread, it was very satisfying and a perfect start to the meal. The only downside comment I have is that the Greek salad was pretty standard and nothing special.<//Review>

<Text>A hidden gem of a restaurant which serves Mediterranean food. My favorite thing to order here are the kebabs! When you order food, you are offered side dishes that come with the order. I usually get hummus and  pita.
The service are very friendly and accommodating. You feel that warmth of eating at a home-feel restaurant. I have made return visits with friends and co-workers.<//Text><name>Arthur Wong<//name>< user_id>

It is a hidden gem.  Everything I have tried is fantastic.  I usually get the greek chicken salad or the chicken breast kabob plate.
The fries are really scrumptious.  Surprising that they have fries, but they are truly really good.

I love that I can call ahead and place my order and it is ready within minutes of my arrival.  They do tons of delivery and take out.
Drive by slow to find the place, it's an unassuming storefront.  I highly recommend if you like Mediterranean.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I ordered from grubhub for myself and co workers. I've heard from others that, they have outstanding food so I thought I would try it out. I ordered and the estimated delivery time said about an hour, I wasn't too happy about but they surprised me by showing up within 20 minutes of placing my order!!

Definitely true about having outstanding food. A hole in the wall place. I plan on going back to them and ordering for work.< /Review>

<Text>From my travels around the world and coast to coast with east coast being home. Tonir is most authentic Armenian food I have experienced outside of Armenia. The outside doesn’t do the restaurant justice but the interior far surpasses the facad and the food is absolutely amazing. Will come back over and over. Thank you Tonir for being the most true and Authentic Armenian cuisine.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Oddly situated restaurant in the middle of an industrial area in Burbank. You'd easily drive by this place without a second thought. The interior is relatively spare but seats more than you'd expect.

I ordered to go and the beef in the beef salad was still tender and juicy even after sitting in the to-go box for an hour. The ikra was one of the better ones I've had. I'm not sure why it's universally called eggplant caviar because there's no caviar nor eggs for that matter. The Armenian coffee was strong without a huge amount of sludge.

Parking is plentiful on the other side of the street with diagonal stalls set along the entire street.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>This food was amazing and so were the staff, and the prices are great. We ate here a few weeks ago and are still buzzing about it. The people leaving bad reviews are probably the ones with the attitude problems.

We can't wait to go back!< /Review>< date>

Great spot! It's my new go-to before or after a flight out of Burbank--the airport is literally a 3 minute drive.

The food is fantastic. A heaping plate of two pieces of flavorful lule kebab on rice plus two samplings of their appetizers (love the smoky eggplant dip and tzatziki-like yogurt dip) and pita will set you back $6.75. A sprinkling of sumac seals the deal.

The place is a local, family-owned restaurant with friendly and attentive waitstaff. They have beers on tap and apparently live music on Saturdays to keep things festive. Looking forward to returning again and again.<//review>

Hubby and I were in town for a meeting. After we checked out of the hotel I needed to kill some time and was hungry. Decided to see if I could have Greek food delivered to parking lot. Lol..after all this is SoCal right? I ordered via grubhub, 20 minutes later my parrot (in the car too) were grubbing on yummy yogurt and cucumber, lamb chops and hummus and pita bread. Life is good.< /review>

Could have received the 5th star if there was more value in the meal. I bought the Chicken and Beef Shish combo plate and only got 4 pieces of beef when I should've been given 5.
Aside from missing that piece of beef I was also given maybe 2 spoonfuls of Tabule. You'd expect a fuller plate as the partition on the plate could've easily held at least 4 times the amount given. Especially when I look at some of the photos posted by other Yelpers, seems like they received a lot more than I did.

As far as the quality and taste of the food, I can't complain. Definitely delicious, but you could get so much more and just as good, if not better, at Zankou Chicken paying a few dollars less. I don't nickel and dime, but in terms of value (and a missing piece of beef) for a first timer, I had to rate this a 4 star.</text>

This place has horrible service. I ordered three plates for delivery at 12pm and they did not start preparing the food until 1pm, so my food did not arrive until 1:30pm. I called and asked why they were taking so long and they gave me a really bad attitude like if it was my fault for ordering from their restaurant! If you read all this, please know this place is not worth it at all, save your money and go eat at any other place.</Review>

<Text>Worst Jack in the Box I've ever had the displeasure of visiting. I usually have to wait 20-30 minutes to get my food, 10 on a good day. I keep telling myself it'll be better next time, but it never is. Only gave 2 stars because food is usually hot and pretty fresh.</Text><Gmap_id>0x54d2ec7b9ba20973:0x2e5bbe106966f9f6<//Gmap_id></record>

This is my favorite place. Week in and week out we can rely on the food and relax in the restaurant for an hour or more comfortably. In a hurry? No problem, these guys can do fast, even when there's a crowd. That's why so many people are, like me, "Regulars."< /Review>

Loooooove Jack in the Box! Love their iced coffees, their fries, their burgers, their tacos! So good. It's VERY busy at every Jack in the Box I've been to, so yes, wait times can get wild. But the food is so worth it, I don't mind. Literally love itttt.</text>

1. I waited in the drive-thru for nearly 20minutes.
2. The fries were warm at best.
3. The bun on my sourdough jack wasn't even toasted.
I keep telling myself "It's going to be good this time" and it never is.<//text>

I got the Double patty Sourdough combo and it was AWESOME! The sourdough had a nice light crisp on the surface, the meat was perfect and the onions and cheese were great! I loved it so much I ate 3 in two days. I don't recommend doing that as it set me back on my diet a lot but every bite was worth it! Thank you Jack!</review>

Michael the night manager is very good at his job. He makes sure everything goes as smooth as possible. He has made my food perfectly everytime. Is very accommodating because of my allergies. Thank You Jack in The Box for hiring such a good man there needs to be more people like him in the fast food industry.</Review>

<text>Very disappointed. Lobby was closed so had to go through drive-thru, no problem.  One car ahead of me, one behind so not busy. Paid for my food a waited. And waited. After 10 minutes girl came to the window and apologized for the delay and asked if I would pull around to the front and she'd bring out my order just as soon as it was finished.  I agreed, thinking they were making fresh batches 14 minutes waiting and she brought my order out and I was on my way. Got home and unpacked the bag to find the burger patties were old and dry, burger was swimming in mustard to the point that you couldn't hold the burger without getting mustard all over and the fries were old, dried out and cold and way oversalted. Total waste of my time and money. They did get the chocolate shake right but I won't be going by there again in the near future<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Do not come here expecting food that is fast, or food that is food even. The best part of my 45 minute ride the the drive thru of dissatisfaction was getting to the window to see a group of dim witted employees giggling at the counter while customers waited nearly an hour for a  order of 15 chicken nuggets and 2 to tacos.

Simply put, just don't.</Review>

Had to run down to 273 today so I swung into Jack in the Box for lunch and I was disappointed. First the service was slow, guess I was there about 15 minutes or so. It looked unclean, from the drive-thru window, and the food dident taste as yummy. It was just another fast food place today....you know?? Going to shy away from ole Jack for awhile.<//review>

They have drive thru only at this time due to the pandemic, which is fine but they are very slow getting orders out thru the drive thru. Had to wait 10 minutes just to get up to the speaker to give my order. Then when I got the order the onion rings where so over cooked that they snapped and the onion itself was completely dried out. I usually enjoy their onion rings but those weren't even edible.<//review>

This is THE WORST Jack in the Box in town everytime I swing by out of convenience they not only mess up the entire order the staff are unfriendly, and the food is ALWAYS stale and cold even when they have me pull around to wait on "fresh food" it is still cold and gross by time it gets to me< /text>

They got everything right, were a little slow, but were very clean, wore masks, and had a plexiglass divider. Their nuggets are not good, like ever, but the southwest cheeseburger was pretty good. The loaded mini tacos are the exact right kind of indulgent and disgusting. It's drunk food you can eat sober.<//Text>

Extremely slow service, very rude employees- They got my order wrong and tried to blame it on me. When I told them they had the wrong item on the receipt she asked me if I had told the menu number of the sandwich to her coworker. I told her that I said the name of the sandwich and it was repeated back to me.  We were told to pull over and they would have our food right out. We waited over 15 minutes for them to bring out only the sandwich they corrected,  not the other 3 meals. We had already paid and were hungry so we had to wait even longer for them to bring us the rest of our food! Yikes!<//review>

They could have just easily walked out and taken our order but instead they let us walk away. Jack in the box not just this one doesn't seem to want to help people out during the Covid 19. This is not my first problem with Jack in the box but it will certainly be my last. Thankfully the guys at AMPM next door were amazing. what a disgrace Jack in the box. I see why you only have two and a half stars. When I worked in fast food I would have never let a customer walk away. I would have figured out a way to help them out.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I eat here pretty often because its not only close to my home but the food is great and the customer service is really good also. The drive through gets a little long at times but its worth it for good food. I order the loaded breakfast sandwhich with mayo almost everytime now. Its become my favorite on the menu. Everyone should try it if u love breakfast foods. I would recommend eating here.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Just went through the drive thru. I didn't get my full order and my sourdough jack was cold. I called to fix this mistake and they told me I could get the rest of my order next time and even after asking them to make up for the extra gas and time I have to spend to get what I already paid for they refused. Complete disappointed and upset that I'm not being treated right, yet they had no problem taking $25 from me. Not to mention the fact that I'm taking extra risk cause of the covid-19 and now I have to do it again. Jack in the box is not supportive of people or anyone dealing with this deadly virus.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1588347674299, 'text': "Thanks for letting us know about this, Danial.

<Text>Service was absolutely painfully slow. Cashier kept walking away from register. Not enough staff for lunch rush. Also cashier was constantly holding her breast then touching food. It took 25 minutes to order and 15 to get our food. Ridiculous.< /Text><userid>109876870056890771281< /userid></record>

Good food for fast food. As a family of 5 we can never get out of there for under $40. On the slow side too, but always have nice people working. It's super annoying, but make sure you have your ID if you order more than $25 using a card in drive through!< /text>

This particular location is very hit and miss. A lot of times the burgers are way over cooked or old. I've eaten here several times because it's close to where I work but it is definitely not my first choice. I love Jack in the box just not this one. On a good note I did have a great spicy chicken sandwich there last week.<//Text>

<Review>This place put 5 nail clippings in my nacho taco and they didn't give my money back when I brought them the taco with all the nail clippings that I pulled out of my mouth from a bite. This place is trash because of this. And by no means is this a false story I have pictures to prove this absolute messed situation.
I will never eat at a jack in the box for the end of time. Because this ruined me buying the cheapest tacos ever< /Review>< user_id>

I had ordered a meatlovers burrito and a shake.( yeah I know weird combo) I ordered said burrito with NO egg, which I would assume the burrito would then have meat, cheese and potatoes inside. NOPE what I got was a flour tortilla with 3 pieces of meat, that was it! Where the hell did the potatoes and cheese go... Not in my burrito, I can say that. Really bummed out and won't be returning to this location again.</Review>< pictures>

Personally I love this place, me and my family come here all the time the service is great, and they are usually really fast.Jack in the box is the place to go for a quick bite either am or pm.From  my understanding,they are open pretty late.</Review>

Just what you would expect from a Jack and the Box. Not the best food in the world but it's what I crave sometimes, especially the tacos. I got three tacos and some onion rings. The service was very fast and efficient. Nothing more to want from a fast food restaurant.<//text>

<Review>Most terrible experience I've EVER had at a Jack in the box!! I've been all around the country and I've never been so disgusted with they're food. They gave me cold food, burnt fries (they were black) I can't believe I was served this disgusting food. They had me park in front for they're sake of the timer not going off for they're benefit. They didn't give me any ketchup or hot sauce or even napkins! Plus the work place was a disaster! I had to walk in to get my food because it took 15+ mins!< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x54d2ec7b9ba20973:0x2e5bbe106966f9f6< /Gmap_id></record>

Long wait in lobby. Not just the first time, but every time to date.  Drive thru is faster.  Always short handed and inside facility is always in disarray. Always food on the floor. I even witnessed an employee scrape food off the bottom of their shoe. 🍟</Text>

Ive ordered 3 burgers from here on 3 occasions. All of them were terrible.
The first- patty was BURNT
Second - patty was COLD
Third - The cheese was STALE
Steer clear if you want fast food go to Carl's Jr. Their burgers are comparatively priced, but much higher quality and service.< /review>

I went here and ordered an extreme sausage the old over weight Lady at the window was very rude I ordered one thing she somehow messed up my order didn’t give me any napkins she lied to me about who the manager was she was dirty and wasent wearing gloves while handling my food this was by far the worst experience yet and every time I go there when that lady works it’s the same thing there is a couple nice people that work there but she is not one them she needs to be fired  immediately if not sooner and when I call they don’t answer the phone and when they do that same lady hangs up on me cause she’s scared of losing her job I’m sick of their customer service and how unsanitary they are I will be complaining to the corporate office this woman needs to be fired when she opens the window I shouldn’t be able to smell her b.o. and see her dirty hands without gloves I’m so disgusted</review>

Its a middle of the road jack in the box,  it has problems with bums so they have to lock the bathrooms, and have signs saying "30 minutes max in the dining rooms" but the service is decent. I usually use the drive thru.< /Review>

There was a rock in my burrito.  I told the manager but she didn't seem to care even though I made it clear I wasn't looking for a refund and was just notifying her for quality control.<//Text>

Refused service because I asked for my veterans discount. No basic math skills, no communication skills, no management skills. Poor service and lack of cleanliness. The corporation should close this store down.</Review>
