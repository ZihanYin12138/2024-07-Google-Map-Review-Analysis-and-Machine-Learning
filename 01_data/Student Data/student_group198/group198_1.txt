< Review>
J Nails & Spa did an incredible job with my Full Set. They have lasted me over a month and a half and still look amazing. I made an appointment before hand and received on time, exceptional service. I definitely recommend others to try out J Nails & Spa because this is without a doubt the best, cleanest, and most professional nail salon I have ever seen!!! You won’t be disappointed!<//Review>

I absolutely love this place. The most amazing people to talk to while getting my nails done or feet and so good at it as well❤️ I come here about once a month and I live about 15-20 minutes away, wouldn’t pass up an opportunity to come here. 1000% recommend.< /Text>

It was my first time going here, A coworker of mine said they were amazing which they are I 100% would Recommend. They got to me right away and I showed a picture of what I wanted and the result was almost identical. If you want five star nails for a good price this is definitely the place to go.</Review>

Great service, high prices but it's California.  Why a 3?  Cash only business for payment, asked after the service is complete, or Venmo or Check were offered alternatives. .  No reason for this in a business and they should state it up front. But it's not reasonable that a nail salon does not accept credit card payment.  I won't return.< /Text>

<review>After rescheduling 3 times I just walked out extremely upset, no use in making a reservation time if when you walk in on your appointment time you will still wait.

After reading the reviews I decided to give them a try. It is so hard to find a good nail salon.  Their attention to detail was off the charts. They were courteous, skilled, and friendly.  Pretty sure I will be a new regular.  They paid close attention to my comfort and never rushed. They even managed to get my nails nicely rounded. I am a very happy customer.</review>

The staff there are superb, along with the beautiful and modern salon. My nails turned out absolutely perfect!
I have gotten so many compliments from men and women.  I have to admit that I showed up 30 minutes before they closed but they still saw me and stayed more than an hour after closing time to finish me up.

Thank you J Nails & Spa for my amazing nails<//review>

They always are so amazing every time I come in! I am super impressed today because I wanted a really bright yellow with glitter but none of the colors were quite right. She took the closest color and put white under it to brighten it and they turned out better than I could have imagined.</text>

<review>This nail salon is great! They are so friendly and their prices are reasonable. They take time to make sure your nails are done right and even give you an amazing shoulder massage while you are waiting for nails to dry. The nail tech even gives you an exfoliating scrub to use while washing your hands. Lots of SNS colors to choose from. Will definitely be coming back!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>This was a true spa experience. The staff was very kind and sweet. They even ran out to feed the meter for me. They took their time with my Mani and Pedi and that's what I enjoyed the most. My gel looks amazing. Great results when time is taken to make things look beautiful.

I have been going to J Nails & Spa consistently for the last 6 months or so.  They are efficient, kind and provide a high quality service.  I've paid almost twice as much for manicures at other places and inevitably the gel is peeling within a week.  I get a gel manicure every three weeks and the gel is still on almost perfectly and with almost zero peeling!<//review>

Super friendly staff and a great pedicure!   Glad this is near my house!   They were busy when I walked in so I had to come back later with an appointment but I guess that’s a good sign that they weren’t completely available right away...</text>

Finally a nail salon I can stick with!! I moved here about a month ago  and went to a couple places that only disappointed me from the customer service, to the actual product.

They are very friendly and take their time to do a great job. I am very pleased and will be coming back!
They also offer 7 day guarantee on SNS so that is a definite plus!<//Text>

They are quick, friendly, and did a nice job on gel manicure n regular pedicure. Added an extra 10 minute foot/leg massage and it was more than worth it.< /text>

This place is amazing! I have the worst track record with pedicures but this place finally broke it. They were nice, friendly, and stayed 30 minutes after closing for my sister and I to get fantastic pedicures! Will definitely return and recommend to everyone!</Text>

<text>They took me right away and got the basic pedicure which was really good. Their leg massage and massage chair was awesome, and I got a pretty star design for Fourth of July. It was clean and lots of color selections. Will be coming back.</text>< gmapID>

J nails is a great place to go if you want to be treated well and leave with the nails of your dreams. I am new to the area and came to J nails after a very bad experience elsewhere and they completely gained my trust. I found my new place and I plan on going regularly!<//Text>

Loved this place, but when I go to sit down and show a “nail tech “ a picture and I asked what’s similar to this rose gold in this picture and shows me a brown grey you shouldn’t be doing nails. Had an appointment at 2 thought it was with my normal girl waited till almost 3 got the guy who didn’t know what to do then she pushes me off to wait till tomorrow, if I wanted them done tomorrow I would of come tomorrow. Won’t go back. 😡<//Text>

Made an appointment the day before, after reading google reviews and this place did not disappoint. Made an appointment at 10, when they open, but got there 15 min early. To my surprise the whole staff was already there and they took me in early, before they were even technically open. I got a regular pedi and gel mani. Reasonably priced and a great overall experience. My new go to place.<//Review>

Love this place from the moment I walked in. They did a fabulous job on my mani(gel). I needed a pedi to but another nail salon messed my toes up so bad, they told me to wait until the cuts heal! This place will now be my go to place for pedi/mani!!! Very much recommended!!!!<//text>

They're really as good as their reviews ! I've lived here locally my whole life and they are hands down the best, most respectful, clean and affordable salon in town. Their prices are very reasonable. They never rush and take pride in their work. They always give a great gel manicure and trim all my cuticles and even though I wash my hands 100 times a day my gel nails last OVER 2 weeks every time! Definitely give them a try :)</review>

<Text>I honestly had no idea that this was here and I'm so happy that I found it. I really needed a mani/pedi and they managed to take me despite the fact they were closing in less than 50 mins. This place is clean and doesn't have that strong chemical smell to it. The chairs are really new and they take their time with your nails. I opted for a regular pedicure and a gel mani. Totally worth the price and wait. I'm definitely coming back here.</Text>< Date>

< Review>
My friend and I had an appointment for 6:30 today. They asked me to have a seat and got her water going for her pedi. I sat there for a bit and had no updates at all as to when I would have someone over. A couple of other ladies walked in after I did and got seated and going. I sat there until 6:52 before leaving. I certainly will not be back.
On a positive note...I did observe they use an ultrasonic to clean their instruments which is super nice to know they sterilize with heat.<//Review>

The staff were really nice they squeezed me in. My nails came out really nice and the guy really took his time and made sure I was pleased. The price was extremely fair. I will continue to go J's nails. They always please me.<//Review>

Today I had my upper lip waxed by Amy, (Licensed name: Thanh Nguyan) this was the first and the last time I will be in that salon. I left the salon feeling a burning sensation on the right side of my upper lip through out the day it turned into a what looked like my skin had been ripped of, which is why I felt burning sensation after I left the salon. I couldn't go back immediately because I had already gotten to work. I returned later this evening after I was off. I wanted my money back and I wanted to show Amy what she did, I spoke to the owner Dang...He has no compassion what so ever about what Amy had done to my face. He was starting to get rude, mad, and defensive saying it was not their fault that this had happen, Amy wouldn't even look or talk to me. She was arguing with him in Chinese. I really hope all reading this think twice before going to this salon for a wax because, it is not worth the pain and embarrassment I have to deal with now. Thank you Dang for your not so great hospitality today, in which your salon website says you strive to do. I hope this cut does not get a scar or infected. I do not yelp but honestly I am very disappointed in how this situation was handled...Very unprofessional.</text>

< Review>
👄NAiL 👐SnoB here! Quality work here ladies.  J Nails has the tomboys covered!!  I get a full acrylic DIPPED set in under 75 min--60 min if you dont need old nails soaked/grinded off. I have been getting acrylics on & off for ~ 10 yrs now @ 5th (ish) shop now. J Nails is the 1st place where I've returned for a fill with all 10 nails still in tact! I have two kids under 6, I garden w/out gloves almost daily, paint, etc..I have the most "boyish" worked hands of any gal I know. These DIPPED acrylics are strong. Make sure you ask for "dipped acrylic set."  The finish is thicker and thus less natural looking, but it all looks the same to me tho-- waaay better than a few broken nails!  A few bucks cheaper than any  place in town plus they're  open until 7:30pm. I cannot get to a nail salon before 6:15 and everywhere closes at 7. Cant say enough good things</Review>

<date>1492031795748</date><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I had a pedicure at J's on April 11th.  A new employee used a large holed cheese grater on my feet to remove calluses. She did this super fast and took off part of my heel.  I thought they would have comped me the pedicure but instead they charged me $5.00  more than was quoted. When I mentioned my cut heel to the owner's daughter she just looked at me and said "sorry" . My heel is red and raw and if I get an infection I'm calling the health department. I will not go there again.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Worst manicure I've ever had.

Edit to add:
They clearly pay for 5 star reviews. Click on the profiles of the people giving 5 stars, and you can see.<//text>

< review>
Fabulous mani and pedi. Nice new salon,  all new equipment. Super clean. will use liner on pedi tub if requested. On Friday mid-day no wait.
Update: i used this salon for about a year. As they got used to me my mani/pedis took longer and longer each time. Then the manager asked me to teach  an employee how to do a pedicure. I asked to see his manicurist license, it was obviously forged. It has been awhile since this happened, please be aware.</review>

OMG!! I saw that cheese grater thing! Don't go to this place because when they hack you, your body pays and your pocketbook pays! They're out for one thing ; your money!</text>

<Text>I really like coming here. Since I stopped going to the dealer I've been coming here. The owner is very nice and treats me with respect as a women. Because a lot of mechanics are not very nice to women. Can be a little pricey in some things but service is excellent. Only big major problem is you have to get there early because it gets real busy real quick.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< Review>
I’ve been coming to this guys for years even before he owned his own shop and I can tell you that he knows what he is talking about. I can’t understand why people here are saying he’s a crook you guys don’t know him like I do so stop with that bs talk if he says you need to replace it then replace it he would work with you if still feel something is off then just talk to him I’m sure he would fix it and work with you if you just ask. Best shop ever people! For those people that can’t afford taking there vehicles to dealerships then Navel’s Auto Repair is where you want to take your car because at the end of the day dealerships are the crooks not him. Tell him that “El Chiquilin” recomeded you there.<//Review>

They know what they’re talking about, but they’re shady. You go in with 1 thing wrong & they’ll pop up with something else. They will change stuff around and tell you that your car is messed up in a different area. . . Specially when Work is slow. They do shady work<//review>

<text>DO NOT BUY FROM HERE! Habib, the guy I worked with told me he was running my credit once and ran it 50 times!! Causing my score to drop drastically. Not only that, the car he tried to sell me had a hole in the mirror and transmission issues! These ppl are scammers!!

I loved the service. The car they got me and my fiancee in was a newer year than the one we planned to get. It was low, low, low on mileage and smelled new. The tires were great, brand now and so was the interior of the car. I love this car and I loved their service!< /review>

They sold me a vehicle with electronic issues! They made a big deal about giving me a new battery and I bought that vehicle less than 6 days ago and the battery is already dead!!

Tail light special? They took advantage!
Do not go there! Especially, do not trust Tommy! Or Rodger

Again, do not trust them! Do not go to San Jose Outlet

Do not deal with Tommy especially!

<review>After having my work truck break down on me I was in need of a replacement truck.  Roger was very knowledgeable helped me find a good truck and worked with me to make it work.  They even stayed late to make sure I went home with my truck. I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a good car and great customer service.< /review>< Rating>

<Text>I'm surprised there are so many good reviews. I went looking for a used car and was met by 3 different employees. The first looked like a manager and said he didn't have time to show me cars, a girl didn't know how to explain their pricing, and another ate instant ramen while showing me a beat up minivan with a broken mirror. Their cars also don't have mileage posted when browsing in the lot.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I give these yahoo's ZERO Stars. (had to give a star just to post) We purchased our vehicle from San Jose Auto Outlet in November of 2018. You know that temporary sticker they tape to the inside of your window? Ya! That thing! It is temporary registration good for 90 days. Well it has been a few days more than 90 (180 days and still counting) and we are still waiting for these yahoo's to finish up the paperwork and get it to the DMV so they can issue me MY LICENSE PLATES. So we wait and wait. If you don't want a Lic Plate for your car this is the place to go. I will never do business with the place again. I will refer no one!!!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Was TUFF goving 1 star.. Recently purchased vehicle In Dec 18 Tags Expired jan 2019 was calling for weeks to figure out when tags will arrive since reg fees and smog fees were all included in purchase. Fst forward yesterday..Was told I needed a catylltic converter AND SMOG.. Car will need to be dropped off for dmv to verify VIN...They failed to tell me about a window being replaced wrong so i have shards of glass coming out door everytime its shut. All in All i will be getting pulled over and going to court for expired tags in 2 days. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO MAKE FAST DECISIONS HERE WONT EVEN BUY HERE. THERES SEVERAL HIDDEN FEES AND THEY COULD CARELESS ABOUT HONESTY. DO NOT TRUST THESE GUYS. MY REG IS CURRENTLY IN LIMBO A MONTH ADTER PURCHASE. DO NOT BUY HERE!!!!!<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

I hate this dealership I bought a car a year ago still owe on it and I've been trying to fix it for almost a year. I put 3000 dollars into the car and every time I fix it something else goes wrong. now it's the power steering pump and they want 1500 dollars more please please please do not buy a car here they're rip offs. and of course they're not going to help you I brought the car back two weeks when I bought it they said we can't help you cuz you don't have a warranty on the car. read the small print and take it to your mechanic before you buy it.<//Text>

we got a 09 c300 Merc from these people,
Brian Covington and Tony Danesh helped us a lot.
They spoke very nicely, much better than Toyota showroom near the jail.

The process went kind of slow because they were busy on Sunday evening with 3 sales at the same time.

This review is after 2 days of purchase.
might update if I run into any trouble.

regarding other -ve rating, Tony mentioned they changed the staff.< /Text>

< Review>
Extremely dishonest car lot.  My wife and I bought a 2500 record which they had to keep for 2 days to do some repairs on it and the very next day after we received the car back the transmission went out and the engine seized up.  I have left countless messages for the owner and manager but have yet to receive a call back. Please do not go buy a car from this place< /Review>

The worst car lot I've ever seen the hole lot looks like a wreaking yard the cars look like they came from Pick and Pull you have a guy working out of a container and some fly by night mechanic shop it's the worst I'm telling everyone I know to stay a way and all so calling the Better Business Bureau</review>

This store is located inside the Stonestown Galleria shopping center with plenty of both outdoor and indoor parking.

I've bought several systems and gone overboard buying games here more than once.  Not always the biggest selection but only because its a smaller mall location but they also always had wanted so I can't complain.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
great store! employees are super nice and patient and they have a surprisingly good stock considering the store is rather small! they have a great selection of ds and 3ds games and an ok selection of switch and ps4 games as well. i think they recently got rid of the display with ps3 games but they still have them if you ask :) would recommend if you’re looking for new or pre-owned games or accessories.</Review>

This GameStop is better that the one in Westlake. They still try to up sell you but they're not that pushy.</Text>

Fast service and great stock! I needed to get an amiibo and the cashier told us to ask one of the people that work there and there were some people available to help and he got out 5 amiibo I wanted very quick and the payment was VERY EASY too. This is a very good GameStop store!< /review>

<Review>I have been swindled for the last time. This is the third reservation that I have made at this location and it is the third time that they have not fulfilled their commitment.  I would like some clarification how 3 of the 4 locations near me have guides and preorders fulfilled and the Stonestown location did not.  Why is it that I had to pay to preorder something, and not receive it when it was promised.  On top of that; those who did speak to me in store - Austin, AJ, Joelle, and Elena were of no help, assistance, or comfort and not only dismissed my questions and concerns with attitude the employees tried to lie to me about the order due date. I paid to preorder and expected to get it on a certain day and time.< /Review><user_name>Joshua Ornelas< /user_name>< user>

a gamestop like any other

a bit smaller, but generally have any game you might be looking for.

if they dont have it, they will be more than happy to call another store to have them hold it for you while you go over there.<//Review>

< review>
California's overlooked museum and underrated as well.
This place of historical significance was amazing.
Our tour guide is George and he was a wealth of information from each and every door, stairway, and room.
No pets allowed but fantastic job  by the friendly and well trained staff!!
If I could give more than five stars I would.
Thanks again George!!!!<//review>

Love this place. I can go back in time and just imagine what it must have been like. Came here with my parents and now I bring my grandkids.</Review>

<Review>I actually really enjoyed my visit here. I went during their Spirit Tour and it was centralized around the ghosts and paranormal experiences people have has there, it was also really informative.
They have regular tours as well. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable and seem to enjoy working there.
I would absolutely come again<//Review><response>None</response><user>101669936916767003424</user></record></dataset><record>

<time>1551329563594</time><rating>3< /rating><Text>Very interesting place i highly recommend it because it is the last civil war post in CA, but the guide we had was really condescending to my 9 year old that didn't know much about the civil war yet and she was OCD about making us move in a certain direction through the tour, and not touching anything at all except for the stair banister. She seemed like over the top about it. I thought she could have been a little more friendly towards my daughter she was obviously knowledgeable but no personality whatsoever and made my daughter feel like an idiot.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

< review>
The Last time I went was years ago, and I just want to say that this place has a lot of history behind it and if you want to know more about the history of Wilmington Ca. and know more about Phineas Banning and all this indeed is the place to come to for a plenty of history about Wilmington as well as the Drum Barracks Museum. It is really a neat museum as well as you can really learn a lot about this place and how Wilmington was founded and about this wonderful Museum. So if you would like some history about Wilmington Ca. and all Please come here to the Drum Barracks Museum you will get a lot of history as well as learn more about how Wilmington was founded. Please come here it is great. I also got to sing here for the founding of this place years ago and I was glad that I got to sing when this place was refounded. Thank you so much.<//review>

It was closed when we arrived, but just walking around the perimeter of the grounds gives an amazing sense of the history. It is a fascinating since we so often think very little of the Civil War in LA because, as a state, we where new to the nation. Completely worth the visit.< /review>

The museum has a fascinating history as it was not built to teach about the history, but is in fact history itself.</Review>

Fun and exciting and the food is to die for and the staff are so personable  you look fwd to visiting . The potato skins and bacon wrapped jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese . are defiantly 5 star all the way . wash it down with there vary own craft brew . and it makes for the perfect night out. Casino ain't just about winning real money on the 4 card tables . this place has seriously stepped up its game .This is paso at its best.< /Text>

Random card room tucked back in the cut, with a great bar and killer burgers. Literally, stumbled in one night and was impressed with how nice the people were, cleanliness of the bar area, and they had tater skins. Winner winner chicken dinner. Good people watching too...<//review>

If you were going to casino at night be careful. there are thief that will try to rob you when you go to the parking lot at the casino. When I was playing a game a stranger walk up to me and ask me money because he had lost a bet of a game, he ask be about $50 and $100 to borrow and then I said no, then he would just get mad at me for that. There isn’t that much security inside of the casino. There is a lot of people complaint there same reason there. The casino doesn’t have that much security to protect the customers. Only Thursday the manger is very rude to the customer and when the manger does the dealer job the manger usually does the game called poker and is very rude and not that good at it. When I was playing at that table no one like how the manger did it. I forgot what the manger name was but it was a she.< /review>

<review>This is one of the nicest small casinos I've visited, every one is friendly and the variety of games is great. Seems like there are a few regulars here who just love it, for good reason too! Food and cocktails are beyond what you would expect for such a small place, definitely my go to when i'm in town.< /review>< Pics>

<review>No other casino will have better staffing than here. Rob, Rico, and I believe his name was Jay, are wonderful people with a good heart. There are only a few tables but just enough to have a great time! The drinks are also amazing and if you like cookies, you'll love the cookie in the cast iron! It comes with some fruits and ice cream so it's sort of a pizookie. Love this place and would come back again!<//review>< Pictures>

Great food & service at the bar. Appetizers, flat iron steak, poblano chicken sandwich, and mango cheesecake were surprisingly good. Bartender friendly, talkative, and outstanding service. Management acknowledged our presence, and asked if we needed anything. Did not gamble though.< /Review>

<name>Anders Uphoff< /name><Text>Stopped here for an afternoon to kill some time. First played poker for several hours, and both the dealers and other players were very friendly and welcoming.

Later played Blackjack as well. All the dealers I encountered, to my knowledge as amateur, did their jobs very well, especially Nick. Came out about breaking even and despite not winning had a very fun and good time.

The place isn't super fancy, but a nice, clean, and laid back place to gamble for a few hours. Will certainly stop her again in the future.<//Text>< gmap_id>

So came here after they moved and remodeled the bldg they bought. Way better vibe. There is music, the employees enjoy being here. More lively. They also have food.
If you like playing tables and haven't been here, you should. Even if you don't like playing, come for the food and drinks. Tony knows how to make drinks! And the chef knows how to make the food. :)< /text>

This is a great Casino. Not only does it have gambling, both tables and poker  games but it also has food,full bar, a separate outside lounge and eating area to enjoy those warm Paso nights if you want something quiet, but some nights great singers for entertainment.

I am a guy and tend to play tournaments and cash money games, but the friendly atmosphere allows women & beginners to feel included and have a good time. In addtion, the laughter and cheering of  women from the other side of the room at the game tables is very pleasant to hear.

This may not be the place for serious professional poker players because everyone is just having fun, but it is perfect for me< /Text>

<Review>The casino part is kind of nice and the dealers were all pretty cool.  The "bar" however needed some work. The bartenders washed dishes for 25 minutes between ordering and making the drink.  It took 29 minutes to get a drink while I waited at the bar watching the two bartenders wash dishes together.  Blown away! They a were not busy making drinks clearly (or they were doubling as dishwashers) and won't be making any for me in the future.  Very poor service and attitude to get drinks or food. Again the casino was nice but the bartenders and waitress needed some people skills or a better attitude. Blown away!</Review><Time>1522047441288</Time><user_name>This Ridiculous Life<//user_name>< Rate>

Great place for 3 card, blackjack, and hold-em and Omaha.  In the future there may be other games avalable. Poker tournies happen regularly.</text>

I've known about the card room in Paso for years it's been around. However, I figured it's only professional gamblers that went in there. To my surprise you don't have to be a professional gambler to enjoy playing the tables. I watched them playing blackjack and thought hmmm I wanna get in on this action. So I bellied up to the table having no idea how to play except to tap the table if I want another card or wave my hand if I didn't want another one. I follow suit (having no clue why I'm tapping or waving on) thankfully there was only two others at that time and they quickly realized the newbie and I got some schooling from all at the table. Awesome group of people in there. Everyone is very friendly. The kitchen crew, the bar crew and the dealers are all so friendly. My first night at the table I went home with $189 woohoo not bad for a newbie with beginners luck. Second time there the table was busier and the other patrons next to me help guide me on what to do and I walked out with  $95 more than i went in with. The third time I was up $90 but started losing and I lost the $90 I was up plus the $30 I put down to start with.... If I'm gonna play here I might as well work here right ;) come see me at the bar and order some yummy grub! Ok not so much grub but more like 5 star food. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious! I even liked the Brussels sprouts and I've hated them all my life! We have a full menu from appetizers to prime rib around $22...can't beat that. If that's to much order a side of fettuccini for $5. Or the BLT that is hands down the best I've ever had! So what are you doing....get in your car come have a drink at the bar and check out the tables. You can stand back and watch everyone else make that dollar or  you can jump in and make your own. Either way just get down to the casino and check it out! Make sure to ask for a business/promo card and there's a little surprise on it waiting for you;)</Text>

It was one of the funnest poker games I've ever played in. Most of the people had just spent the day wine tasting and were ready for fun.

Nice enough small cardroom, a few tables and tournaments. Great drinks. But rude, slow, and unpleasant service from everyone but the dealers and cashier.</review>

Seriously delicious food, great drinks. Kristen was our waitress and did an excellent job, even recommended a top notch gin drink to my son. I had the El chingon very good.</Text>

The Al Pastor tacos were just ok!  Traditional Al Pastor is rich in flavor, and this tacos missed the mark.<//text>

We were getting to our hotel late & were looking for vegan options, this place was only 5 min away. Our burrito was in a box on its side and all the sauce leaked out. The burrito itself was okay, no flavor on veggies, mostly vinegar from pickled onions. Beach fries were lukewarm, some pieces cold and not quite fully cooked. Avocado tacos were too thickly battered and unpleasant. Overall, it was not great. Side of rice was good & guac was good.< /text>

Good drinks, great service, decent atmosphere given COVID-19.  Reason for 4 stars is that the food we had, the platter with shrimp/beef/pork was heavily salted.  Way way way too much salt on these items.  We ate them but, seriously, cut back on the salt and let your guests add their own.  Corn was delicious, zucchini/mushrooms delicious, lime rice (which tasted like lime rice) was also excellent!  Will go again.  UPDATE:  The last 2x we have been here, the Carne Asada is soooooo salty as to be almost inedible.  Even my nephew who went with us recently said it is much too salty.  The rest of the food was ok.  Portions are small but prices are significant.  Don't know if we will go again.  Sad......because their Cadillac Margarita is Great!< /Text>

We did takeout  and were really impressed.  The fish was great, the rice and sides so flavorful, the salad outstanding.  Really good, fresh food.  Highly recommend.<//review>

<Review>Four of us went on a Sunday evening and found it was less crowded.  We had reservations (recommended) and were seated promptly.  Our waitress, sadly I forgot her name, was super friendly, helpful and took very good care of our table.  The classic Margaritas were some of the best I've had and you could actually taste the tequila, even though a bit small and pricey.  The spicy Margarita was also very good.  Two of us shared the meal for two and although a bit skimpy it was tasty.  All the meals were very, very good and with lots of flavor.  Maybe because it was a Sunday evening, we did not feel rushed and were able to enjoy a great desert.  Restroom is clean and plenty of parking with typical shopping center traffic.</Review><username>Jose .Maciel</username><response>None< /response><Rating>5</Rating><Pics>None</Pics>< Date>

We used to frequent the restaurant. Since restaurants being shut down due to Covid. One would think they were excited to get customers again.  Ya right.  Today we waited until the restaurant opened at 4.  Service was non existent.  Its very sad that workers don’t take pride in their service. And management is to blame.
We left and went to the Cliff Hose where we were greeted and service was excellent.
Sad but with service like today. Your restaurant will be a memory<//text>

Food was fine. Slightly cold by the time it got to us. 2 of our orders were missing. Their phone lines were down so couldn't get a hold of them. Then figured out they had closed early. It was pretty disappointing.< /Text>

<review>First off Tu Madres serves some of the, of not the best craft cocktails on the mid to East End of the valley. Mike has a great innovative bar program that compares to any in the whole Coachella Valley. The drinks are strong, balanced and delicious. You can definitely see and taste that Mike has traveled and picked up some great influences from bars in greater SOCAL. If the drinks weren't enough their food has definitely progressed since they opened and are now serving legit creative Mexican cuisine. Try the mulitas as they're delicious and traditional as they get.  If you're in the mid to East End of the vallley get your crew together and do yourself a favor and party it up at Tu Madres!< /review>< Pictures>

If you want non authentic Mexican food this is your place! Food is ridiculously over priced and the portion is absurd. Not to mention it didn’t taste too authentic.  Service was lousy. My taco was drenched in oil, I practically ordered an oil taco with meat sprinkled on top. Never again. Wouldn’t recommend.< /review>

I have had the pleasure of eating at Tu Madres several times. The waiters and waitresses are very attentive. They all have great recommendations. The atmosphere is great they truly put a lot of time & effort into making that perfect. I like how the bar and the dining area are separated as well. Make sure and try the shrimp taquitos, La Mesa & the margaritas. Do not forget to try the dessert as well you will not be disappointed.</Text>

Not having a reservation on Friday, we were allowed to have dinner, but could only stay 1 hr. 10 minutes, as they would need our table. (7 empty tables when we arrived.) Waitress never returned to refill our drinks or bottomless chips($5). Food was warm at best. Asked to see an itemized bill, which was excessively high. She had credited my card for desserts we didn’t order, before we said anything. Charged me for 2 sides she said came with my order. Again gave me a 2nd credit and said hopefully She doesn’t have to come back for another credit. Very poor service,  Have never been given a time limit for a dinner before at any restaurant.<//Text>

Food was average.  We ordered appetizers and dinner.  A minute after the appetizers arrived, our dinner was served.  Not sure if we were being rushed out or just bad timing.  Main portions of entrees were super small.  Side dishes very large.  Employees very nice. Probably would not go again.< /Review>

Delicious food and cocktails, great ambiance & super friendly staff! We enjoyed several of the bar plates they offer, including the incredible Bar-vacados, Chilies Gueritos and Tacos al Pastor, each of the plates had epic presentation, were super fresh and far exceeded our expectations! The Paloma margarita was ridiculousy good and the El Diablo was even better, if that's even possible.  This place is awesome and we will definetly be back!<//Text>

You have created such an outstanding venue that offers all of the features that a "foodie" demands while dining out.....imaginative menu items whose presentation is only exceeded by how great it tastes. The ambiance, excellect service, reasonable pricing and world class bar elevates the true definition of "Cantina and Grill".< /review><gmap_id>0x80daf9648c60ab3f:0x83982ba00ae9e656</gmap_id>< Time>

Sat at the bar and ordered a couple apps and entrees to share and got a margarita. The drink was very tart, tasted like straight sweet & sour. The chips were very greasy and hard to even bite through, sent them back. Guacamole was good, carne asada tacos were super good!
Honestly, we didn’t have the best experience food and service wise, however it was their first week open so I will definitely give them another chance in the future after they’ve gotten the chance to get into their groove.< /Text>< Pictures>

It's a brand new restaurant, and it is very nice inside, neat and clean. The employee's were exceptionally sweet, they work hard to make sure you have everything you want and need to go with your meal...I ordered a Tostada Grande, and let me tell you it was out-of-this-world, with Ranch dressing. I ate the whole meal. I will go back to this restaurant as mant times as I can. On the weekends they suggest making reservations, you will get seated faster, so we were able to eat in the bar area, it's not right on the bar but behind the bar and it was very comfortable. Our waiter took great care of us, Sandra and Dario took me out to dinner, and they ordered the same thing, they loved it just as much as I did...Thank you for such a great restaurant, they also ate the whole dinner...you won't regret stopping by and eating a dinner...if their is a wait, it is worth it...<//Text>< pictures>

Needs noise baffles on ceiling or something. Margarita was watered down, had to send back. Tamales were so dry I couldn't cut through the masa. Refried beans were dry & like a pile of dried out, flavorless mush. Staff apparently had been kidnapped as none could be found for long stretches at a time. Clearly, the place needs better management. It's a poor excuse for a Mexican restaurant when the valley has too many other good choices.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We were helped by Zack and Mike (hopefully I got that right) and the service was great. The drinks and food were on point! Today my husband just texted me to say he was still thinking about Tu Madres. I replied with, “you know that sounds really bad in translation right?” 😂
I used to bartend and my husband is a chef at a local resort so we are both a little extra critical. This place is the real deal!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80daf9648c60ab3f:0x83982ba00ae9e656</gmap_id></record>

5 of us had dinners two weeks ago. There are no fajitas!
4 of us had burritos and we must say they were not good! The insides tasted like it all came out of a vat!
Not sure we would return or recommend this place. There are far too many really good Mexican restaurants in the desert.</Review>

I watched and waited as the space was transformed into Tu Madres Cantina & Grill.  i dined there several nights ago in a new sleek setting with an awesome menu. The wait staff and bar staff were well trained and described several options i was pondering to order.  I settled on the Short Rib Barbacoa Burrito with a side of black beans. The food was exceptionally well prepared. I chose a margarita to quench my thirst. The decor is new, trendy and spot on for a desert cantina.  Indio and La Quinta are fortunate to have such a sizzling new place. Look forward to seeing you there soon.</text>

The food was the saving grace for Tu Madres. Service was very slow and unfriendly. We also made reservations for six and got stuck at a booth that sat 4 with a chair in the walking aisle. I would not recommend this place to anybody with all the other options available in the area.< /Review>

<review>Another home run by local chef, Andie Hubka and her husband Mike with this new Mexican cantina. Andie's menu is modern, delicious and adds a different twist to the typical Mexican, tacos and beans,  kind of place. We both loved the coconut shrimp, my husband's very favorite meal. The decor is so pretty; I love the "desert modern" vibe with a warm, upbeat bar area .All the menu items look interesting and we can't wait to come back.  Awesome Tres Leches cake and Guava cheesecake!< /review><Rating>5<//Rating><Name>Ginny Sher<//Name><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

Now this is an interesting place if you haven't tasted authentic Mexican food. La Chingona cocktail is a must-try.<//text>

<Review>Tu Madres is an amazing new restaurant. I loved the Tostada Grande with carnitas. The ambiance was great and the service was impeccable.  I can’t wait to go back and try the Coconut Shrimp.< /Review><userid>117951110445255799732</userid>< gmap_id>

We chose to eat at Tu Madres, and we are glad we did,  my son loved the Carne Asada tacos.  My daughter loved the “Dragon Taco”  plate that her tacos were served on,  in fact so much she ordered seconds, something she never does. My wife and I ordered the fish tacos they were spectacular;  I got mine blackened, I recommend you try.  I also tried a couple of their draft beers and if you enjoy a good beer with your Mexican food you will love your options.  Then came dessert;  if you love to splurge a bit the desserts will make your evening.   We had the Tres Leches cake and a couple of churros.  The atmosphere is very refreshing making you feel like you are in a nice restaurant in Cancun.  We are looking forward to going back soon to try some of the other options on the menu.</text>

< Review>
This place was terrible. We had a reservation 5:30 6 people crammed into a booth. Service bad. We got our food  cold. Never went to Mexican restaurant where chips & salsa cost $5. The menu is really ala cart. If you order 2 tacos $9 & rice $5 beans $5 so$19. The tacos are very small. You pay for all sides. There on line menu were different price of the restaurant menu . They add 20% to party of 6 even if you each have your own tip. I know that it just opened but at 5;30 we wanted to order enchiladas & they ran out. What Mexican restaurant runs out of enchiladas at 5:30 dinner hour.  The owners should know better they own cork & fork which we like. They also own heirloom, & now tu madres. Good Luck!!!< /Review>

Everything was amazing, from the decor, the service, the wide selection of tequilas (we had the y tu padre tambien & la chingona, trust me order one or two) the salads, tacos, bbq ribs, and don’t skip out on dessert. The tres leches cake & churros are to die for!</text>

Very busy place had to wait quite awhile just to sit at the bar. So yes reservations definitely recommended. Drinks inconsistent, very light pour, heavy pour, ok pour. Ordered the beef short ribs really good but small portions.< /Text>

Small, bland tacos. Beans were dry, tastless, worse than Rosaritas in a can.for 5$ yuck!
The tortillas are street taco size, come on.
No cilantro, no imagination. OVER PRICED!!
Drinks were ok, margarita was super sour, tho.
Waiter was attentively< /Text>

Myself and 3 friends went to Tu Madre last night for an early dinner at 4:30. We ordered the guacamole and chips and the Ahi wontons. The Guacamole tasted nice but there were literally only about 2 tablespoons and a large handful of chips served for $10. We all had margaritas which were $11 on happy hour price and what we all got was a tumbler full of ice. 2 of us wanted to order the chicken enchiladas but we were told they were "all out" of them. At 4:30 ? I would think the enchiladas are probably a mainstay of a Mexican restaurant. I ordered a mexi/cobb salad, 1 person ordered the carnitas and 2 ordered the pulpo. We all left the restaurant feeling hungry. Our bill for 2 rounds of drinks, 2 appetizers and 4 main courses was $150 not including a tip. While the food is fresh, the portion sizes are ridiculously small for the prices they are charging. The atmosphere is nice but this restaurant is not good value for money.</review>

We were seated right away and sat there for 15 minutes and no one even asked us if we wanted anything to drink much less if we wanted to order, so we got up and left.  It’s not like they were packed either.</review>

I rented a trailer earlier this month, when I checked out the trailer I asked the rep what do I do if I want to return the trailer after they closed? He told me that I need to put the trailer back in the spot I pulled it out from. Well I used the trailer and I returned it that night around 9:30pm. The next morning I called the 800 number to make sure that the trailer was accounted for, I was on the phone for over 30 minutes as the 800 number customer rep had to call the Simi Valley location for them to go out to the yard and check to make sure the trailer was in it's spot. Before I was done with my call I verified that they would only charge me for the one day. Weeks later I looked at my credit card statement and the charges were way too high, today I checked and this location charged me for two days, so I have been over-charged. I was never told by the location rep to follow online instructions and take photos and videos to verified that I dropped off the trailer. Now I need to work with this location to have them correct the charges as well as, the 800 number rep.  This will be time consuming to get my money back before I dispute this over-charge to my credit card.</text>

Two stars because the manager worked with me to resolve a minor issue. However, the female (name?) that assisted me with my cargo van reservation on November 11, 2020, has horrible customer service skills. Actually, she has zero customer service skills. No eye contact when she spoke to me. No direction on next step. Mind you there was no other customer when I walked in nor was she handling a phone call. The van was dirty inside and outside. Even found empty water bottles up front.</Review>

<Text>Make sure YOU check they equipment. The U-Haul attendant attached the trailer to our SUV without any problem, the loaded trailer fell off while under tow and damaged our vehicle. After inspection, the locking mechanism that tightens to the hitch was broken, very obvious. U-Haul should have caught this and not released the trailer or fixed it. I should have checked before driving, I trusted they would have done this. No one was hurt.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Horrific customer service. I come here about once a month to fill propane for work and everytime the employees are unprofessional. Sometimes don't even know how to properly fill a tank asking me for help. The last straw that lead me to writing this review is that I walked in with 2 customers ahead of me in line. Where 4 employees did not bother to acknowledge me and help, they'd rather good off with the first customer in line. Very disappointing. Too bad there are only a few propane providers in the area.</text>

< Review>
This business charged me twice, for no reason. I have the receipt stating the price and they just went ahead and charged my card two separate times instead of once. There was no additional milage or damage done to the truck. It was returned on the same day. Customer service REFUSED to help me with the extra charge. Had to go through my bank to dispute charges. I've never had an issue with U-haul before. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION.<//Review>

They DO NOT service their trucks!! I just rented a truck with the engine plate unlatched in the cab. My leg is bright red from where the flaming hot air burned me from the escaping engine air. The AC doesn’t work & the brakes are squealing in need of a brake job like months ago. I am still waiting over 2 hours for their roadside assistance with no resolve in sight!!! My advise DONT DO IT!!!!<//review>

Every time I come to this location, someone tells me there "nothing they can do" to help me. From refusing to trade in a trailer that was too small to refusing to unpack a pallet so I could buy the supplies on it, they display an attitude of disinterest verging on obstructionism.

Stay away from this place! I spoke with Brandon Rivera & Chris Gomez about getting a propane tank refilled and they refused to refill it even though it was during business hours. I called when I waa on my way to the store and they told me that it would not be a problem and when I got there 15 minutes before the store closed then allof a sudden they cant do it and it was a problem. Very bad customer service & customer experience<//review>

Fast service.  Although it wasn't very crowded, they got me hooked up with the trailer and done with the paperwork much faster than any of my other experiences. Obviously, it may depend on who is working but given the volume of tricks and yakkers returned after hours, of the were as soon as my experience with the Agoura Hills location, there aren't enough hours in the day to process that many orders.< /Text>

Rented a truck on Saturday brought it back on Sunday night after hours and forgot my sunglasses inside the sunglass holder on top of the truck, called 7am Monday to make sure they hold it for me since I clearly remember leaving it there. They said they will put a note in the account. Got there few hours later and it wasn’t there, the 2 guys that were there and said they already cleaned the car and didn’t find anything.  In other words they stole my $200 sunglasses, I couldn’t really prove or say anything just that I will never use these guys again.< /text>

Bad customer service. Was trying to fill a propane tank and said that it was expired and had a dent when it didn't have any of those things. Went to a gas station and filled it up for me and even cheaper. Wouldn't recommend U Haul.< /Review>

< Review>
The truck I rented had loose steering, exacerbated by the strong winds we've been having. It also had a very bad exhaust leak which made the truck really loud to drive and on the second day, one of the cables on the roll up door broke, which made the already difficult to open door even more difficult to open and close.

I'm glad I bought the insurance, because the guy who checked the truck basically tried to blame me for the sh1tty condition of their equipment.

I've rented from them in the past and it was fine, but damn, my last experience there sucked!!!</Review>

<Text>I brought in my dad's old boat on a trailer that had not moved in 10 years with some bad wiring problems. Although the wiring guy wasn't there the first time I came in the morning and they would not let me leave it, so I arranged to come back later in the day. I came back in the afternoon,and the technician met me by my car before I even go to the door of the office and rewired the trailer in less than 30 minutes for dirt cheap. Great job!< /Text>< time>

I live in Moorpark and have tried on four occasions to get a truck from this location to facilitate a large, ongoing relocation of my residence and furniture business.  U-Haul has a horrible system of assigning the rental a day prior, no matter how far in advance the reservation is made.  On three occasions, I was assigned to pick up the truck in the Valley (30 miles away) and on the fourth, the only occasion where one was available in Simi, I was "upgraded" to a truck that was much larger than what I needed at the time and did not want.  After repeatedly complaining, I received a message from the manager Jim that next time I rented a truck, he would guarantee I could get it at the Simi Location.  Despite many attempts, getting Jim on the phone has been impossible and that "next time" found me having to pick up the truck in Winnetka, costing me precious time, additional fuel charges and miles to coordinate.  I have another three or four truckloads to move, so will now have to try Penske or Budget.  Hopefully, they are better in this regard.  VERY disappointing and frustrating!</Text>

I used to work as a mover so I am very familiar with UHAUL and rent it. Usually everything goes well and there really aren't any problems worth mentioning.
About 2 months ago I rented a little 15ft truck so I could go pick up a refrigerator and a safe. It was late when I got home, so I just left everything in the truck and went to bed. I woke up the next morning, went to work and expected to be home around 2:00 in the afternoon. My girlfriend called me and told me she would return the rental because it was looking like I wasn't going to make it in time. She returned the truck and I got home a few hours later. First thing I said to her was, "Thanks babe." Second thing I said was, "Were is my flashlight?" She said she didnt know it was even in there, but I knew I left it the front seat of the truck. So I call down to UHAUL and of course nobody there had seen it. First of all it was a $110 dollar flashlight, tactical, very unique and awesome flashlight, and second, it was my favorite tool. I know I left it in the cab, I left it there on purpose thinking I would just get it the. Next day. This is what really gets me. The guy I talked to on the phone told me " We are not responsible for items left in the vehicle. If we find something it goes into the lost and found, and since it's not there we didn't find it." I said "Wooow, you guys shouldn't even have a lost and found, I mean why wouldn't you just call the person who last rented the truck? And let them know they left something." I mean c'mon, UHAUL has the address, phone number, and card infotrmation of the very last person who rented that truck. He says "let me go look" when he comes back he tells me there is a flashlight in the lost and found... Now let me get this straight. Their company policy is to call the customer and let them know that something was left in the truck, but if they had done that there wouldn't be a flashlight in the lost and found. It wasn't mine of course.
Long story short, poor customer service, poor attitude, no urgency regarding my issue. In my opinion, very much lacking in quality and accountability.</text>

<review>5 stars all the way! Ordered lunch for my staff of 20, and it was delivery on time and correctly. My staff appreciated the artisan sandwiches and raved about them all day. The prices are excellent and the quality far exceeded my expectations. I'm so happy I was able to support a local business and get a great sandwich at the same time. I will continue to use them for all my staff functions.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE1x-jdMoM66mhkO2X0u50jehtsXbnmjyRmLIT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZF_wX30QRxrsw71RDPMzIBJ4k1hw5tyVKk3na=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

Had a very nice dinner.  The Java Bakery Café' were good - and it is nice to see escargot on the menu since it is kind of a specialty item.  The service was great and the outdoor seating was nice.<//Review>

Thai chicken wrap is terrible. It's cold and mainly consists of bean sprouts, cucumbers and carrots. The very little chicken there was in the wrap was cold, white and tasted like it was boiled (not grilled as advertised in the menu). I am not picky with food but this was the worst. Especially considering 12$ price.</review>

After my mother's internment,  my father and I stopped by Java Bakery Cafe for a pastry and coffee.  Java Bakery was clean, comfortable,  and quiet, which is just what we needed. The coffee was smooth and the pastry was delicious.  Thank you for your polite and courteous service.<//text>

<Text>First time here.  Saw the good reviews and said I have to try it.   Ordered a ham & brie on a toasted everything bagel along with an iced tea.

They put my sandwich on a croissant instead.   They said it was better on a croissant anyway and I accepted it.  Tried it and immediately regretted my decision.

The counter help was professionally polite, but by no means were they warm, friendly, or inviting.

I asked for a refill on my iced tea and they informed me that refills are one dollar.  This is the first time I encountered a charge to refill an iced tea.

Since I eat out for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day I am always on the lookout for new places to try.   Needless to say, I will not be frequenting this establishment again.< /Text><date>1578593235007<//date></record></dataset><record>

I had a chance to speak to the owners on a few occasions and they are attentive to their customers and incredibly kind. Their pastries are made in house, as well.

After visiting several times, this place has become my favorite coffee shop. Their coffee drinks have all been phenomenal, they have fantastic Persian tea, and the pastries I've bought have all been delicious. I will most definitely continue to come back here, especially since the employees are always friendly and helpful, and the environment is so relaxing and calm.
Love love love it!</review>

Try their wraps... I think they are very unique and pretty healthy too.<//Text>< Pics>

Fix your DoorDash pricing. I'll gladly pay extra for size upgrades or extra toppings/condiments/whatever. But it's wrong to basically give customers the wrong order just because you messed up your DoorDash price options.</text>

< Review>
This place is so yummy. I've just discovered it a couple days ago and I've ordered a sandwich and panini for lunch from there so far and they were both delicious. I'm working my way through their menu and I haven't been disappointed. I also tried their chocolate chip scone and it's to die for. It literally melts in your mouth. I highly recommend this place.<//Review>

Didn't think the coffees were anything to write home about, but they had a simply awesome selection of baked goods. I liked being able to sit outside with our dogs.< /review>

<review>I have lived here for 18 years and feel safe in this community which is proven time and time again to take care of each other and look out for one another. The on-site management team that currently looks over our community ensuring it is safe and peaceful does a wonderful job in doing so always quick to help when asked. I couldn't be more thankful for the home that I own here and the community around me.<//review><name>Ann Hironimus< /name><time>1546645397243</time></record>

Nice quiet place to live & visit, but the visitor parking is very limited & so far from the person I'm visiting! They really need to re-evalualate the parking situation.< /Text>

<Text>Can definitely use more visitor parking options or open access to all areas of the park so that a visitor's able to get closer to their destination.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808fa33d4cb9ed03:0x6633b682f33db67e</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Harbor Village IS NOT an RV park. It is a mobile home park for permanent homes. And it's a really nice place to live. But I repeat, do not call looking to park your RV, it's not that kind of park.</Text>< Date>

Not a fan of MHP's but you can't beat the price for a place to live on the Peninsula. Newer manufactured housing better than most of the existing stock< /text>

<review>My family has been in the park sense I was about 5. It was where my grandmother lived. It used to be just older foke here.
Parking here is dangerious. You get a driveway, and we use to have some parking first come first serve. They now  decided to charge home owners and allow 1 designated  parking for an additional $30.a month in park.(where we all parked for years) Any additional cars must park on Bayshore Blvd where there is no cross walk,and cars fly by and you gotta walk two blocks from your house.
People own these moble homes but pay almost $1000.a month for space and hoa fees. And don't get caught parking in front of your home or even if guest parking is empty and you got off work at 1am You leave your car there and they will have it towed, if your a friend of the managers then you might get a free pass but ifnot,no mercy. The tow yard  had my car for 10 mins and bam $250. Guest parking had no cars all empty. I guess it was in the way??? Ahhh

First off the staff was amazing! Super friendly and helpful.  The only reason for the neutral review is the wait times.  I had a dot drug test and I waited 2 and half hours.  I tried calling ahead but never got anyone to answer the phone.  It’s a very busy place but they make up for it with great staff.</text>

I only go here when I am required too. The average wait time is 2 hours. I have had appointments where I have still waited over an hour to get in. My company pays for me to go here and I choose to pay my own money to see my own doctor rather than go to this place. The people that work there don't care about your inconvenience, because most are forced to go there.<//text>

A pretty good Concentra location, certainly way better than the one on First street in town. They could improve by allowing appointments and making priority for those needing urine tests. Expect to be there about 2-3 hours or so.</Review>

This establishment has no respect for patients time. My appointment was at 2:30. I sat in a room until 4:07. At that time I walked out to ask when I would be seen. I was told I was next. I asked how much longer it would be, as I needed to pick my children up. The MA asked what time did I need to pick them up? What does it matter?!? I have other things to do besides spend 2 hours waiting when I scheduled an appointment! Literally a few seconds after our exchange, the doctor came in. 2 minutes later, the appointment was over. If I wasn't mandated to use this doctor, I would never step foot in this office!</Text>

<text>I will never go back to the East/Jensen office. The waiting was horrible, the staff not friendly, way understaffed,they didn't complete the paperwork for the DMV correctly so I had to go back to get them to finish completing it then return to the DMV AGAIN!! keep in mind how lines are at the DMV! I had to return the next morning for physical even though I showed up an hour before they opened had to wait an hour!! Then once I finally get out of there after dealing with a unfriendly doctor. I find out they sent my drug test results to the wrong employer!! So I have to return another day to retest. This time I went to the North fresno office where they finally get it right.< /text></record>

I believe Concentra is doing their best to accommodate many patients at one time during the pandemic. My only hardship was setting an appointment as they didn’t have any availability when I needed to come for my first visit, so I ended up waiting for about two hours. My second visit went a lot quicker despite not being able to set an appointment for what I needed.
The staff was very patient, efficient, and helpful.<//review>

Day one
I was injured at work and spent over 5 hours here on the day of the injury. The wait to be seen was 2 hours. During those 2 hours I witnessed no one else in the waiting room that was in pain. It appeared that I was the only one having difficulty sitting/standing which I vocalized to the employees and also showed through tears.

Day two
I had physical therapy which was a total joke. They put me in a room, gave me an exercise to do, then left the room. I finished my exercise and then waited 20 minutes for the therapist to come back in just to give me another exercise and leave again. Once again I sat for 20 minutes after I was finished before the therapist came back. Meanwhile, I heard him speaking the whole entire time to another employee.

Day three
I had physical therapy again and to no surprise I was given an exercise and left for 30 minutes.

Day four
Physical therapy again which I insisted I was done and no longer in pain. The therapist spent some time with me watching me do the exercise and having me run some drills.

I feel the need to point out that only two out of the three days during physical therapy was my temperature taken and I not once witnessed any sanitizing of the equipment being used.  Also my temperature was taken under the tongue which I was asked to remove my mask and then watched the gentleman next to me get his taken as well with just the prob being changed...no sanitizing of the thermometer was done before or after my temp was taken.

Day five
I had a recheck appointment with the doctor. I waited 40 minutes before I was even checked in which then made me late for my appointment. The whole time I was in line, I was also on the phone trying to check in but it also took them 40 minutes to pick up the phone. I proceeded to ask the lady in the front office what I should have done since I had an appointment and her response was wait in line. I honestly do not think I should have had to wait behind walk-ins. I ended up being at the facility for 2 hours when I was only seen by the doctor for 5 minutes.

I felt like I had no choice but to follow everything that was told to me or else work would not cover any further injuries. I felt extremely uncomfortable in the PT room.

I would like to take a brief second and say that all the staff was really nice hence the one star. I just feel like the Concentra way of doing things during this pandemic is a joke. There should be a sign in sheet for appointments or an employee should walk outside and ask if there are any appointments. Injuries should come before walk-ins for drug screenings. Also the physical therapy side should be more attentive to their patients and let them know when they seem okay enough to stop PT and not the other way around. The PT side should also be given a no touch thermometer and stricter guidelines to sanitizing the room/equipment.</text><Rating>1<//Rating>< resp>

<Text>I came in because I thought I broke my back. The lady behind the desk had me standing and waiting around in agonizing pain talking to my company about Workmen’s Comp. For 30 mins before they took me to a room. Then once we got to a room A nurse was training someone and taking their time. The doctor was extremely unprofessional and was arguing with somebody to come help me sit up because he didn’t “want to”. All he did was give me ibuprofen and started leaving the room without telling me what was wrong or how to fix anything. Everyone was extremely nice though.< /Text>< resp>

Been here since 845am for a pre placement physical, it's now 950am and I was just now called on to an exam room. From desk is not very friendly,
and I noticed sometimes they are walking about without their masks on. I asked for a copy of my records but they would not give it to me because "you did not pay for it your employer did" after talking to the manager they agreed to give me a copy of my tb screening.  They manager was quiet polite and helpful so I appreciate that.</Text>

<text>For it being exstreamly busy which is not something they can control they were very pleasant nice and helpful and as fast as possible not one time did I see an employee standing doing nothing or worse a group and all of the doing nothing while patients wait. And with the pandemic it made it seem more crowded than it was. But there could have been more places to sit or chairs available but if you wanted to wait in your car they would come get you or call you. Thats wasn't so bad unless you might have rode the bus. Lol thanks again guys.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< date>

I went to this horrible place for a workers comp injury, they refused to see me until the next day. I had a follow up appointment and they changed the time and cancelled on me twice, without even letting me know. I went in at 8 am for my appointment and they had cancelled it, without even letting me know! I had to pay for child care and wasted gas for nothing!!! This is the worst medical place I've ever went to. Not to mention that most doctors there aren't even American and can't even speak proper English. Don't go to this horrible place!< /text>

Went in for a DOT physical.
If I could sum up my visit in one word in would be Inefficient.
Showed up at 8:30am and wasn't done until 2:45pm.
They do not allow you to schedule appointments for DOT Physicals which is not only dangerous to you and others, but also inconvenient.
I understand first and foremost this is an urgent care facility but a solid 80% of patients are either drug tests of physicals. Which means while I'm sitting taking up a room for 3 hours you're loosing money. The faster you move patients in and out the more effectively you can make money.
Outside of being completely disorganized at the front desk and witnessing half the staff standing around chatting most of the time, they're polite if you are polite to them.
Should probably get some oversight at this location because it is a mess, or get a new manager. This place is far too busy to be running like that.</Text>

Test results took like 13 days rather than the 5-7 days initially promised. The website had zero tracking. No indication that they even had my sample somewhere. Is it in the lab, being shipped, lost? Did it get mislabeled? No update till i finally got results a week past due from my doctor a day before it finally showed up on the website.<//review>

<Review>Still sitting here,
I've been here for 4 hours waiting on a simple dot physical. These literally take less than 15 minutes total to complete. I've watched people come and go, with appointments, without appointments, nobody dying or maimed yet they are all going before me even though this physical was paid for last week at a rate 270% of what I would pay in Colorado.  I am late for work at this point, in a big way. Don't go here, regardless of how professional, they are terrible.<//Review>< pictures>

Why does it take more than 1.7 hrs to complete a Physical? Ppl are forced to come here for mandatory physicals and no way to get around the inefficient way they run this place. How did u guys manage to win contract for workplace testings?</text>

My experience was horrendous, 3 hour wait for a 5 minute drug test. Staff was rude and has horrible customer service. The director was yelling and seemed very unorganized. Bathrooms were dirty where I tested and waiting room was disgusting and with this pandemic.. it should be kept up disenfected and often sanitized. I hope I never have to visit this site again.</Text>

<text>Zero stars, but they make you out at least 1.  It was a terrible experience. I was there at 730am and they were so incompetent that they couldn’t read the form. I was supposed to do a drug test, physical and blood draw. It took them until 9am until I was called back and all they did was have me pee in a  cup for the drug test. I had to explain that the order was for a series of tests not just a drug screen. Once they realized I need the other tests. They said it would be another 2 hrs until I could be seen. The worst part is that I had worked graveyard the night before and had yet to sleep. Needless to say I walked out and will go back to finish when I have several hours to waste !!< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Yet again I had a Telemedicine appointment this morning with Dr. Russum, and an hour later I am still waiting at my computer for her to show up.
They said it will be 5 more minutes, but we will see.
Every appointment I have had with her, I have waited at min 2 hours, and as long as 3 hours.
I don’t understand why Concentra bothers to make appointments, because they show absolutely no consideration for them.
The nurses are all very nice there, but they obviously need more doctor’s and maybe a few more clocks.
Total disregard for their patients time.
I highly recommend you check reviews, and go someplace that wants & values your business.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I was scheduled for a 10am appointment and given paperwork to print, fill out and turn in when I got there. 2 hours after handing the front desk my paperwork I was still in the waiting room. Having a semi polite staff doesn't make up for an inefficient office.

The lady at front desk told us the estimated waiting time would be 20-30 minutes and we are waiting for more than 2 hours here and no one cares about us.
Instead of gossiping and laughing just do your job and understand and respect people who took off from their works to receive your service.<//Text>< Pics>

When i went i was there from 1245 to 430pm just to read my tb test and get a physical. I know covid-19 has pushed things back and made it a little more difficult but waiting that long for a physical and a TB test was ridiculous</Review>

Long wait times. Always telling people it'll be 15 minutes but it always turns to an hour or more. And if you go up, like their sign says to, to let them know that you've been waiting for more than said minutes, they will always tell you it'll be soon, which could mean another hour. Doctors have degrees but are not real doctors. That's why they work there and not at a real doctor's office. And the staff act as though they work at a fast food chain or something, they don't give instruction so you have to ask about everything, even something as basic as "can I wash my hands now". My suggestion, don't quit your job so you don't have to go there again for a new employer. Don't know why every company uses these jokers. A bunch of cast off quacks if you ask me.<//review>

Nice people but the process was way to slow it took over an hour just to get registered.  I showed up at 7:45am thinking I would be in and out because they opened at 7am. When I got there, there was only three people ahead of me.</text>

Was in for a basic physical, had an appointment at 9am and did not leave the facility until 2:30pm. This was ridiculous. They did blood work so they had me fast all night and expected me to not to eat all day. Nurses could not find my vein so I ended up all bruised on my forearms<//Text>

<Text>Literally the worst office I’ve ever been too. Came with my fiancé. Waited forever to get called back. Walk ins got called ahead before him. Finally went back into a room. He was back there for an hour and a half and nothing. He asked the employees at the desk how long and that he’s been waiting over an hour and they said nothing. But as soon as he walked away they started laughing. Do you employee children?? Seriously the most unprofessional “health care” workers. If you hate assisting people re consider your job choice.<//Text><date>1572048158780<//date>< GmapID>

I’m only here to ensure their rating goes down. Their service is terribly slow! I’d rather not waste another moment of my time on them in any way. Hoping to never return to this location for any reason.  End</Review>

The actually visit wasn’t bad. The wait time is another story. It doesn’t take an hour and half for a random drug and alcohol screening. It wasn’t busy in there either.<//Review>

The wait was too long. I NOTICED that the lady who had my folder forgot to put it in the back. My total time there was 4hours.I watched the medical assistants pass the blood pressure cuff person to person using it on others,  me included without cleaning it once.I found that horrible considering the US is  currently going through a viral pandemic. My room was extremely cold,even the MD asked me how was I sitting there in such extreme conditions.If I had a choice I would have walked out.I never want to be examined there again.</review>

If I could rate negative starts it would be a -5.  Went for a drug screen, not my first time going there.  They need to have a big elapsed time display that shows the time .  The gentleman who read my sample said it was not at temperature.  He used a guess at the time which was more than 4 mins . Actual time or someone guessing at  your livelihood. Or have a licensed physician verify not the sectarian your chatting it up with.<//Review>

Honestly you guys need to get it together! It is not okay to keep your patients hanging. You never answered the phone and then I go to the Concentra on First St. and they answer in seconds! You guys have no excuse since for 4 days straight, I was there you guys never seemed to be on the phone with anyone! I’m very disappointed it makes me sad that you guys have two locations and one is better than the other!</Review>

For work related very fast nice place to get what you need done if you are doing a drug test or other. Earing test very small space almost size of a dog crate. But very nice people and fast and nice, location very dangerous. Bring something to defend your self lots of homeless down the street if taken a wrong turn will block the road! Be careful!!!< /text>

<text>It was a fast service for Tb test that I went for that day.  Usually other places would even take me the whole day but this when I went in didn't even have to wait no more than 30 minutes including signing all the paper works and everything very fast pace and the employees are very nice when i went in.  Once
They had me to go to a room when someone comes in they introduce who they are and even tell me what they are going to do and everything which makes me feel good when they are telling me ahead of time.</text>< date>

This place is horrible. So much staff but nothing gets done efficiently. Staff only sits behind the desk and gossips. Had a appointment at 11:45am and didn’t even get out until almost 1:40pm. Waited in the exam room for over an hour. And then had to wait for another 30 minutes to just get my paperwork for work because the receptionist was too busy talking to the other coworker about her weekend plans. Had to go and see what the hold up was and she said oh I’ll just print it out.< /Review>

<Review>I’ve had to come in here 3 different times because this place takes so long. Today I had an appointment at 10am I didn’t get called back to the exam room until 1130 and then they send me back out to the waiting room to wait another hour because they did not have rooms. Now I am sitting in the exam
Room still have not been seen by a doctor I have been in here for an hour. Supposedly they only have 1 doctor here which is why everyone has to wait like 5 hours. I hate coming here doesn’t matter which location it’s all the concentras. I’m only here for a DOT physical for a new job I’m glad I won’t have to come back for that for a couple years. Ugh.</Review></record>

If I could give it a 0 star I would. The fact that these people are even considered in the same bracket as doctors and nurses is a shame. They bring a bad name to anyone in a medical field and every location should be immediately shut down. Super rude, super unprofessional, a place I wouldn't send my worse enemy. Just cause you get 1 or 2 cases that people are actually faking you being doctors should be able to tell when someone is being honest and in actual pain. The fact that I had to beg my Dr's for a MRI for over a month makes a patient feel like he's really getting the best treatment. It's not surprising they work with a lot of workmans comp claims cause they are as efficient as the work insurance. Fractured my ankle back in July still trying to get into surgery. Finally got referred to Sierra Pacific orthopedics and I'm so glad I did. Don't ever let your work say you have to go to this place for medical treatment in California you can choose your own doctor. Don't get screwed like I did. Poor poor experience<//review>

Finally got referred to Sierra Pacific orthopedics and I'm so glad I did. Don't ever let your work say you have to go to this place for medical treatment in California you can choose your own doctor. Don't get screwed like I did. Poor poor experience< /text>

< Review>
I went in for an appointment today, I was help by the gentleman with a ponytail. He was very attentive with me he checked me in at a timely manner with such great positive attitude . He offer me a snack and as I waited to be called in I notice how he was a great help to others in the front office. When went to the back everyone treated me very  kindly and my visit very quickly I look forward to my next follow up appointment thank you all for the services .</Review>

Stefanie, Maricela,and Back office were very professional and prompt in the handling of my drug screen. They assisted in making my experience very smooth and prompt. Jissell was very prompt and attentive to all my questions about the results. The office manager is doing a great job of managing this professionally run medical facility. I would 100% recommend my loved ones to this office if medical treatment were ever needed!<//review>

This is a great place to go I went in for some labs and some other testing that I needed done and it was one of the best places I been the staff is friendly make you feel very comfortable Jissel Laumer was a big help keeping me informed throughout the process as well as submitting my paperwork to the places it needed to go. She made the whole process that much easier she definitely went above and beyond expectation
Thanks again no complaints will be back for any additional needs I may have<//Review>

Worst Doctor ever, Dr. Carlo. I believe that her name. She didn't even interdouce her self to me I only over heard the employee talk about her. If she is so unhappy where She working at she should just leave. Don't have to take her  attitude upon her patient. I hope someone look into this. Bad Doctor.</text>

It was my P.T appointment. They are friendly and likable there. However, I was not asked how I was doing or what are my symptoms at this time. They don’t offer any insight on what stretching or strengthening  moves to do at home for your own issue. I don’t think they KNOW my own issue.  They just go through the motions.< /Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>It really is an exceptional place. The only reason it's no a 5 star in my opinion is because the following;
1. Wait time was just over an hour for a 3 minute procedure that did not require a doctor.
2. While I waited there was a huddle staff meeting in view taking place. I know the importance of them however when I have my child waiting on me I'd like to feel like providing me service is a priority over staff meetings.
3. Customer service was good compared to most places, however it was uncomfortable seeing the trainee who was a positive and smiling young lady be talked to and trained like she was inferior.

Positive things;
1. Cleanliness
2. Keurig
3. 2 TVs with popular channels for adults to watch while you wait
4. Professional services< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>All staff were prompt, polite and thoughtful. We created a quick business friendship. They were open and aware to the fact that I had just come from a long day from work and offered a snack and a drink. Whether it's policy or not, it was appreciated. may add though, although I was injured and in pain,  I still came in with a happy and open attitude myself.

<Response>None< /Response><review>Thank you Fresno Concentra for always taking care of me.   I am very happy with the quality of care you provide, and equally satisfied with your entire staff - from reception, back office, physical therapy, and my treating physicians:  Dr. Fujihara, Dr. Mochizuki, and Dr. Bowen.
I give your facilities a 10 out of 10, both Fresno North and Fresno Jensen.
I always recommend Concentra to my co-workers and friends, and I thank you again for taking such good care of me!< /review>< pics>

I went in today to see Doctor Mangat, unfortunately I was not satisfied with the way he diagnosed me.
The two staff that led me to the exam room were very friendly, smiling, and made me feel comfortable, even asked me if I wanted anything to drink.< /Review>

I first want to say that the staff at the front desk was amazing and their service was great. The reason I am rating 1 star is for the Dr. I can’t even imagine why someone who is that unhappy about his job has a job. Dr Tony Fernandez was beyond disrespectful. Perhaps he needs a refresher course in bedside manners 101. It is appalling that he is treating patients this way. He made me feel incompetent and he was very degrading. I spoke with a friend who also saw him and she said very similar things. Such an amazing establishment and atmosphere means nothing when a health care professional like that works there. I would never recommend this place.</Text>

The front office staff is often rude and ignores you even though you are standing right in front of them.

If you go to this place you better not be dying,  because you’re going to wait a minimum of three hours before going to the back,  then you’ll get to the back way and additional three hours and when the doctor finally comes in that will be the quickest part of everything then you’ll be there 2 more hours just to leave<//Text>

I was told that I had to continue with my appointment after I was released to a specialist. Never got a appointment from concentra just release to a specialist. Was under specialist care then released back to primary physician.  Went back after a few months got chewed out after trying to explain what went on. Not sure how I feel about what happen that morning. Make me second think about about my injury. I going to stick it out and continue to work on a pre injured hand.<//Text>

<Review>I had given this place a 5 star review because everything seemed to go just fine.  I went and gave a hair sample on a Thursday.   I don’t hear anything until today ( Wednesday of the following week).  They call and tell me that the sample wasn’t sealed properly, and could be tainted.   Now I have to go back, which is a 30 min drive one way, and give another sample.  This is going to ad another week to the process, and I can’t start working until this has cleared.  So my review changed to a 2.<//Review>< pictures>

My husband had to come here because of a work injury. His appointment was at 7 am and it is now 8:30 am and he is still yet to be seen. Should not take that long if you have an appointment.

Update: My husband got called back at 8:45 am and it is now 10 am and he isn't finished yet. I've been to a different Concentra location before and that was far better than this one.<//Text>

I couldn't even get someone on the phone. They kept hanging up on me. Then I got yelled at by my work for not making an appointment because of it. Thanks for the stress...like I didn't have enough being injured.</Review>

< Review>
The bathroom light was not working x 3 days. In the place where there is coffee and water on Tuesday  it was full of ants around the area.  I took pictures of the ants. But the worse was the wait 4 hours i was told i had an appointment on that following day at 7.00 am and was seen at 11.00 am for a physical only, everything was so poorly managed as a result it was chaos and staff so overwhelmed every day that it seems nobody cares anymore therefore the service is well you figure it out. ????? It's  disturbing !!!!!</Review>

< review>
Doctor failed to put mg or instructions on prescription, it took Walgrens a whole day to reach anyone at Concentra.
The Dr prescribed a medicine I was allergic to and I ended up in the ER.Even after telling her I was allergic she told me that was the standard drugs for my spider bite and to just”try it”
There is no way to contact Concentra on weekends in the event of an emergency so I had go days without the medication needed to counteract the reaction
The medical assistant who was there had long red fingernails and was very unprofessional, making me repeat myself several times as she entered info into the computer.  Staff could be heard being unprofessional as well, making rude comments about some of the patients.
The nurse who bandaged my bite told me a story about a patient he had one time who had to have their arm and leg amputated due to a spider bite, not very reassuring or professional.</review>

<text>Clean place, but takes a long time. If I would change anything it would be that plus electronic interaction with clients paperwork. If employers cant email needed paperwork  then they need to make sure that there candidates have that paperwork< /text>< date>

<review>This place is just horrific, I got hurt at work and was sent to this place of bad service.  When I  arrived,  I told the front desk that I was in tremendous amount of pain and that the stress of the pain could raise my blood pressure to a dangerous level.  The lady at the did not care she said have a set and the wait was about 4hrs.  Even after explaining to the lady I had just worked 14hrs overnight and was in pain I could not wait 4 more hrs to be seen.  They did not care, they did not see me and after begging the front desk people to help me I had to call an ambulance because my blood pressure was through the roof.

I was skeptical about going but once I met with the staff (Luis, Eddie, Estefani Mari and others) they answered all my questions regarding my injury. They were very professional and courtious of my well being, always checking up on me makeing sure I was ok. I'm glad to have received medical care not only from this place but from the staff. Reassured me that there are still worker comp places that actually care.<//Text>

The medical staff was very courteous and respectful and knowledgeable and I didn't have to wait very long to get to the back to see the doctor. What I did see the doctor though he asked if I had high blood pressure. I said well yes I marked it on the sheet my medication and he even asked if I have sleep apnea I told him no I'm not sure he then proceeded to tell me why I didn't mark it on the sheet and I told him I'm not marking anything unless I have it for sure. He then told me he could refuse the whole thing because I didn't mark it on the sheet and I once again told him I don't know if I have it then he then I I told him about my blood pressure is 140 over 90 I told him he asked if I take medication I told him yes as I have it marked down that's it every now and then I might forget it to take it he then said that I was defiant and I told him I said defiant every now and then I might forget it but other than that I take my medications. He told me that he was going to cancel my medical certificate and I told him I was not in there to renew my medical certificate and that he needs to leave my medical certificate alone cuz it's not due until June he proceeded to put information into the system was kicked my medical certificate out because he says I have sleep apnea because my neck was over 17 in. I told him he had no right whatsoever doing that and I am not in there for a medical certificate renewal I'm in there for a pre-employment drug test and physical he said well you won't be able to drive truck because you're out so you have to take care of your blood pressure. I told him I have my own doctor that I'll get my recertification so he needs to correct it in the system since I've not in there for that once again. He did what he wanted to do and I told him I said you're making me upset I need to leave now so I left and I told him that he needs in the system so it doesn't affect my medical card for my class a license. When I left the room he stated that my class A license was not valid beings my medical cert high blood pressure. I asked him who do you think he think he was to screw with people's lives by inputting information on their license when they weren't even in there for that recertification. I told him out there with that later but what he's doing is wrong and it's not warranted<//review>

< review>
I came in for a physical exam including eye exam, checking for hernia, blood pressure, etc. When I walked into the facility I was greeted and was assisted by Eddie. He told me to fill out some forms and bring them up to him once I have completed. While I was filling out the form, I was observing the people around me including the staff. My heart goes out to Eddie because he was doing 3 tasks at the same time: handling a patient over the phone and 2 patients in front of the counter. It sounded like the patient on the phone with Eddie was very impatient and screaming at him while he was helping out the other 2 patients. Eddie remained calm, apologetic, and explained to the patient on the phone that he was helping 3 people at the same time. As an educator, I have been in Eddie's situation where I had to deal with juveniles and monster parents. Right after I finished filling out the form, I went up to Eddie and handed in the forms. While I was handing the form to Eddie, I told him that he's such a very patience person and thanked him for not letting the impatience person bother him and his work. Thank you for your patience and keeping a professional look, Eddie!

While I was waiting to get called into the room, there was a lady that came to the waiting area and went from patient to patient and asked about how their day was and asked if they want any snacks, drinks, or any assistance. I have never seen this before in a clinic nor a hospital. This really showed me that Concentra really cares for their patients or visitors. I forgot to ask the lady for her name but what she did that day really made me feel like home. Thank you for doing that.

Jessica and Lliana are the two staffs that called me into room to do my exams. They are the sweetest and nicest human being that you'll find in this facility. I feel like I have known them for ages. They do carried a very good conversation with me as well. They smiled a lot which made me feel homey and welcoming. Lliana is such a sweet girl! I didn't have any pockets or nowhere to put my wallet, sunglasses, and my mobile phone. Lliana offered to hold them for me while I took my eye exam. Thank you very much, Lliana. After the eye exam, Jessica and Lliana took me to a room to check on my blood pressure and my hearing. While they were prepping to give the exam to me, I told them that I have never had this kind of experience where I feel like I am wanted in their facility and treated me like a VIP. Those two young ladies have passions of what they're doing, very easy to communicate with, excellent patience, and friendly. Thank you, Jessica and Lliana!

Will I come to this facility again?? Of course, that's only if I have any type of exam at their facility.</review>

This place still runs extremely late and never seems to make progress on medical care.   AVOID THIS PLACE BY ALL MEANS POSSIBLE

you are rarely ever seen on time.   If that isn't enough it takes longer totgo  your follow-up appointment,b after your appointment has ended, then the amount
Of time spent with the doctor.   Communication is very poor as well< /Text>< Pics>

The wait for my appointment was adequate for the procedures I was defensively going to. I left the clinic with a positive impression of concentration.
