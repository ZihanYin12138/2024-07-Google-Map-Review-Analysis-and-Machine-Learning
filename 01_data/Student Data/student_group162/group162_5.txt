No matter where I am in Southern California, I always return to our local United Oil station, in Carson, to fuel up. Their fuel runs more efficiently than any other in my Sequoia and is, by far, the least expensive. Their staff are friendly and efficient.< /Text>

Gasbuddy says this is the cheapest gas in temhe area. It was very busy on a Saturday afternoon, but worth waiting a few minutes to save some money on gas.  They take credit card, and you can enter and exit from both sides of the corner.<//review>

<Review>This place is crowded almost all the time, but you can't blame them as they have some of the lowest gas prices in the city.

You have the option of paying for a car wash at the pump (and coming back another day for the wash, if the line is too long). I believe the code is good for at least a week, if not 30 days (I don't remember).

The store is clean and well-lit. Since the store is bigger than most in Carson, they have a little more variety in products. I've found the associates to be helpful and courteous.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Ive used my brand new debit card and brand new credit card on at least five or six different pumps here. Every single time it tells me to see cashier so I have to go inside. I don't know if you're just trying to get people in your mini mart to buy stuff but I think it would be better to fix these so that you can do your part in keeping the spread of covid down and exposing your workers.</review>< Rating>

<date>1605110355251</date><review>Prices are one of the lowest in the area so it can be really busy and congested at times. Clean store and restrooms. They have a lot of food items on stock to choose from inside. They are also one of the few places that serve "cafe de la olla" coffee. Pump tank isles are nice and wide making it easy to drive in between vehicles at the tanks. Car wash is pretty decent too because the high power wash pressure is really strong and they give you the option to purchase it at the pump when you pay at the pump with your card.< /review><userid>117311225408673273662< /userid><resp>None</resp></record>

I was extremely hungry one day and purchased a hot dog, I couldn't believe how hard the bread was and the hot dog taste luke rubber. Not impressed! Gas and chips only from now on! Secondly I don't like the fact that Middle School children have to remove there backpack prior to entering this location while a employee stands at the door and checks receipts.</Text>

good gas prices and good selection of snacks. but beware when you use your card at the pump. this place is notorious for having card skimmers. i hear about it all the time and its even happened to me once. The manager was notified but didnt seem to care. if youre going to use your card use it inside.<//Text>

This location usually has the lowest prices of any station in the area. Unfortunately this also leads to this location being very busy all the time. Luckily there are many pumps available and multiple entrances and exits. All of the card readers and buttons work properly and the screens are easy to see and read. Sometimes this station is so busy that I would just skip it and go to the higher priced place down the street.<//Review>

Nice place, but tried both the expensive car washes and they both have issues. For starters the machine cant tell how big your car is so it can damage the side panels and mirror. The wheel cleaner rotates and hits the car if you aren't stopped where it thinks your wheels are. The 15 dollar  leaves you with water on the windshield and rear view mirrors, wouldn’t kill to run the air again or a little slower. While the second more extensive one leaves the same amount of water but with a bit of soap. Not sure what you get with the cheap one.</Text>

Cheapest gas in the area. Probably similar to ARCO in price. Takes credit cards unlike ARCO. Unfortunately, the gas pumps cant print receipts. You will have to ask the cashier for it.<//text>

<Text>Pretty nice station as it is well lit, well stocked, and fuel prices are cheaper than most. Sometimes the card readers at the pump don't work properly. The restroom toilet is stained with feces frequently lately. My main issue is that most of the staff are unfriendly. I went the other night to purchase fuel and a lotto ticket using my debit card and the young lady had no issue.

The following evening, I go again for the same thing and purchase the exact same way, and the male cashier scolds me for not telling him beforehand that I was purchasing a lotto ticket using my debit card. He went ahead and performed the function but he pushed my receipt and ticket at me like some little kid. The staff weren't unfriendly similar to this when the place was new. The female cashiers are generally a little better but the male ones are very unfriendly.

I am tired of coming here and frequently experiencing the poor attitude of the staff. Only 2-3 of them are nice. I only come now when it is convenient for me and I try to now avoid going in. They're probably tired of seeing me too, so I have remedied that by making the extra drive to Sepulveda Blvd. and visit the ARCO and Chevron down there. At least they're friendlier.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>Not a touch free car wash (thankfully). I'm tired of driving all over South Bay just to find everyone has gone "touch free". If I wanted "touch free", I'd use a hose. Surprisingly clean for this neck of the woods. Best gas prices within 4 miles & affordable car wash.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

It is usual to have to pay a lot for gas a lot of the places I go or for the lower prices so it's a four-star just because of the prices other than that that attendant was very nice< /review>

<text>So my dude and I had a little lunch date for our 5year anniversary. We walked it and boom clean, peaceful and polite!! Food came fast! Teriyaki chicken was bomb!! Following weekend we ordered delivery late one nite. Our order was wrong. I called the following day and the manager didn’t hesitate to make it right!! Thank you< /text>< pics>

This is what you get for $11.14 drink not included. Food was just ok nothing to go out of my way for. Portion was a major disappointment. I’ll stick with panda.</text>

<Review>My favorite fast food place! Super friendly environment fast service. The girl with the sparkly mask definitely needs a raise. She explained the whole menu and was very patient with me while ordering I’ve never felt so welcomed.🥺💘<//Review>< username>

<Text>I really enjoyed the Mad Orange Chicken. Has just the right amount of kick without sacrificing flavor.

Portion size needs work and online ordering doesn't have the option to double up on portions, so I phoned in for a work around and the manager there helped me out; I highly recommend this place.

tl;dr: Portion size needs help, but their management is super friendly and willing to help.</Text>< UserId.>

I ordered one bowl but I’m pretty sure I could have fed my entire family, they had such large portions. I also tried the salmon bowl and that tasted sooo good...they get fresh fish everyday and I definitely tasted it!!! So recommend this place</review>< Resp>

Good quality food. Fast service. Lots of options. My favorite is yakisoba noodles. I'd recommend it as a nice place to eat at it is high in protein. Everything I ate was fresh and delicious.<//Text>

Of the 3 large bowls we got were filled with liquid.
The steak was terrible, pulverized cheap meat that barely resembled beef. The vegi consisted mainly of
Cabbage, tiny slivers of carrot, barely any broccoli, and a wee bit of zucchini. Very nice for my son to have bought dinner for us and it was disappointing.
Never again.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>The chicken is delicious, orange chicken portions could be bigger but that’s not their fault. Fried rice was spot in with the teriyaki sauce. People that don’t like this place and complain are the same ones waiting in line at Panda Express for mediocre chicken and sad noodles.<//review>< Response>

Comments: My order#16058808 I spent 28.10 for two combos and gave a 2.00 tip for the amount of money I spent this amount of food wasn't worth it and also they didn't give me my egg rolls that were supposed to be included in my meals I have to drive back and waste my gasoline for two eggrolls I received more rice than I did meat and vegetables I feel like I can go to panda express and get more food and payless I'll never do business here and I also recommended my family and friends not to do business there aswell completely unsatisfied customer I feel I should be compensated for waisting my gas just two pickup two eggrolls when they didn't even take my order correctly yet I even went out of my way to offer a 2.00 tip to not get my eggrolls and waste my gas I give this restaurant a one star there food is a joke there beef looks like grinded up ground beef they gave me more rice than meat and vegetables there beef is salty and there egg rolls are greasy and have no flavor I would rather purchase eggrolls from panda express I will never ever do business here again ever i think the flame broiler has way better teriyaki bowls than this place and it's worth it than this place< /review>

<review>After spending $42 dollars on food, they messed up my order and gave me the wrong rice and wrong noodles in my bowls. I ordered the orange chicken bowl, regular size and it had like 6 little pieces of chicken. The fried rice had no flavor. The noodles where bland. The sauce was so salty I could barely eat it. This place was a big disappointment.< /review>< pictures>

Amazing caverns in the Mojave desert. The tours are not running right now due to Covid. When they are running it is hard to get into one. They only run Friday, Saturday, Sunday twice a day, 15 people only. Book early and really try to see them!< /text>

< Review>
A little known, hidden gem in the middle of nowhere, this 2 hour tour is very much worth with the visit. Our tour guide, Will, is personable and humorous. The pathway to the cavern was just recently built or renovated within a year or so. This place was privately owned and hand-built by a couple who later passed away in the 1980’s then sold off to the State Parks. Lots of cool facts about this place that I’d consider still part of recent history.

Pricing: $10 adult, $5 children and $10 parking.

Fun facts I learned: this limestone cavern is so solid it withstand earthquakes. A great hideout place in natural disaster.

This place deserves more attention and protection. Really worth the drive to pay a visit. A nice walk through living history.</Review>

<Review>This is the most amazing place in the world. Do not go, unless you call well ahead and obtain confirmed cavern-tour reservations.  Forty people per day, weekends only. Seriously, search for the telephone number and call two to three months ahead for reservations. If you heed my directive... and call ahead... Maybe. Otherwise, forget it. You are wasting your time. No last-minute cancellations... believe me.

Look for the skinny Cave Wolf in my pictures. If you believe, you will see her. She is there.< /Review><response>None<//response><user_id>117272189714816917994<//user_id><GmapID>0x80cf8e5a63200a35:0xe0903b2baf1beb97</GmapID>< Time>

<text>What an amazing place! The history you learn about the Mitchell Caverns is incredibly interesting. Learning how the Caverns formed to how one family tried to capitalize on them and they ultimately ended up as a state recreation area inside a National Preserve is a fun journey through time. Be sure to allow time to explore the little museum and adjoining trails. You'll see some of the best views the Mojave Desert has to offer.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><userid>105502456738491151961< /userid>< time>

Beautiful park with spectacular views. We are our lunch at the picnic area and the desert beauty was so overwhelming that I had trouble concentrating on eating. You really must visit this park if you are in the area. Make reservations in advance to tour Mitchell Caverns while you are here.< /Text>

Really informative tour and a great walk through a very well maintained cavern. I liked that there are only small tours brought through. Very unigue and interesting cavern formations.</Text>

My boys and I did the Hole In The Wall Ring Trail, Mitchell Caverns and nearby Kelso Dunes all in one day, late winter. We had a great time and saw a great diversity of what the Mojave had to offer.<//text>

Mitchell Caverns was a great place to visit. Tours are on weekends only, and you have to make reservations in advance. Reservations are taken Monday's.

Ask for Andy, best guide for State Parks!</text>

Such a cool place to visit - they have camping all around but dont forget to make a reservation. There is plenty to do around the area and definitely recommend scheduling a tour of the local cave system, so cool!<//text>

The caverns are located in the Providence Mountains State Recreation Area. In short, it is very much worth it. They are easily accessible from the I-40 via Essex Rd. Tours are limited. You will have to call the ranger station to reserve a spot.< /Text>

It's a learning curve. The tour guide is full of information and history back from the begining. The two caverns are smaller than i though. The ranger qont take the big group because it's hard to control. We cannot touch anything in the cavern. With the big group you wont be able to see or hear anything in front. It's quite a distance to get there unless you came from Barstow or Needle.<//text>

It's very special and well-preserved. Reservation required by phone only on Mondays. Tour guide is very knowledgable about caves. The whole tour takes about 1.5 hr.<//text>

I accidentally broke the most expensive olive oil and I'm talking the biggest bottle and the owner was the nicest guy and didnt even get mad. So I cleaned it up and then offered to pay and he politely said no it was an accident. I just want to say thank you Sir for your kindness.</text>

Has everything I need for my hookah when I'm down visiting the family in Riverside. Easy to spend a lot of money in this market but well worth it. And customer service is excellent. 5 stars all the way.</text>

Arabian/middle Eastern food/ groceries. Also a decent selection of beer. More than you'd expect from a liquor store but less than a more beer centered store. They have some pretty cool middle eastern things. Check it out for sure.<//Text>

Love this place. I've been coming here for years and I've always been treated with respect as well as everyone I've seen in there. They do a good job on always being stocked and have a good beer selection. They do have an atm inside.</Review>

Great prices & selection especially if you are buying liquor because this store has the best prices over any of the other local markets & even the supermarkets. I send all my clients to King's. They are always friendly here and the owner iz a great guy. Gotta support Riverside businesses like this here. Keep the money flowing in your local economies!<//Review>

Highly recommend this medical office. The staff are very helpful, patient and accommodating. All steps of the process are explained thoroughly. It was a pleasure doing business, and plan to refer close family and friends here. There is secure parking as well. Thank you Dr.420 and staff! 💯</Text>

Staff is absolutely amazing. They aren't here to add $10 to this & an extra $25 to that. Prices are very reasonable, becoming a new patient or just simply renewing is super easy and you feel very comfortable. Definitely didn't get paid to add this review, I will for sure be back. Thank you ladies at the front (very knowledgeable) and thank you Doctor.< /Review>

<Review>Place was super cool. Price for rec is beyond fare. For new patients $55 and renewals $45. I was a returning patient from another doctor. In the past at other  medical recommendation offices I had to sign up as a new patient because I had not previously use them for my last rec .But the girl at the front said no problem and gave it to me at the renewal price and then she noticed that I only had $40, so she ended up giving it to me at that price so I didn't have to pull out money at the ATM. Not saying that will happen to everyone who goes in there but I had a great experience at this office and would for sure recommend it for someone in the bay area looking for their medical cannabis card</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Fast and professional. They give you price options and tell you what's best for your problem. They also have companion certificates for your pets for landlords. Walk-in allowed. Great Dr< /Review>

<Text>The Price Is Good but what made me upset was the service of one of the receptionist. Although she seemed like she knew what she was doing She didn't convinced me. One of the reasons being that when she filled out my recommendation she made a mistake and wrote down an extra number on it ...I found this out later that night when I went into a cannabis club. Its probably because she was so busy eating gummy worms and laughing with her co worker. The wait was also extremely long...</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

Website said $70 and they tried to rip me off for more. When I told her the website said $70 she said that she would "cut me a deal and charge me $70". After that tried to charge me another $20 for a card.

Besides that I half ass filled out 7 pages of random questions that when I turned it in she glanced over and the shredded after I left. Kinda odd but not my business.

Lastly, unless the lady at the counter is a doctor I never actually saw a doctor. Again kinda odd but not really my concern, I got what I came for.< /text>< pictures>

Dear Sam & Niko,
If you ever happen to read my review, please note that in from India and I aspire to work for your studio. I think that a friend of mine would also like to work for you. I can't get any information to contact to you privately so I'm just trying a very social method of communication. If any body who knows these guys or has any contact information reads this please consider to give that info to me. Thanks for your time.
Yours grateful,
Chidanand Nakade.< /Review>

<Text>Would recommend! Last time I went, one of the chefs ran outside covered head to toe in flames. Not sure if it was a grease fire or a whacky killing ritual, but I dig it. After a few strides, he collapsed on the street. Maybe the dude would have lived if there was a crowdsourced firefighting and medical app. They should put the epic photo of him in flames on his grave. Fortunately, the guys didn’t see me spying on them because I was wearing my emergency green screen blanket that makes me invisible to human eyes.< /Text>< username>

Lovely pepole but don't be a stan and go to their studio uninvited or unannounced and try to go inside.  Just don't.

Although I believe they enjoy fanmail.</review>

Great service, but the waiter kept running into everything with his one wheel.
They have a great entertainment staff with a buff dude doing a bunch of pushups while taking about law so go look for that!

5/5 would come back again</text>

Great service and food, but the guy with the long hair and beard keeps tryna shoot me with BBs and another guy keeps calling me his son... (Don't know what that's about). Yep, still great, but they really hate it when you insult their udon soup.

You guys are my heroes! Please continue being great, love the podcast, too!

Nikko, I appreciate the heart that you have for people! You're a gentle and loving soul, at least on camera. >.>

Wren, you suck at one wheeling. (not really) I love how you get irritated with things.*carbon fiber is actually indestructible btw*

Sam, I love all the passion you bring to the group, as well as Nikko, but you have a different type of passion and ambition. You are also one of my personal favorite people to see on the channel and congrats on little sam!

Jake, keep doing what you are doing, I love the water raft... you tried.. but seriously though, all the work that you have put in say's a lot of the man you are.

Clint, you are so funny bro, definitely makes my day when I see you!

Gabe, I love your beard and honestly, I wanted to get a shirt from Indigo Prints, but college life has me busted right now.

C-Mike, I low-key cried when i found out you were leaving. I'm definitely gunna miss you, I loved seeing you tormenting wren. :)

Nick, I love how subtle you are with your pranking, and keep the awesome edits coming through. Love your work man!

Christian, keep pulling those videos off the internet bro, don't let them take corridor cash. I love your hair bt-dubs.

and now the finally Jarrett, I know you probably don't get as much recognition, but I see you dog.

Love you guys, please continue making awesome content and I hope to meet you all one day before I die! You have all vicariously saved at least one life by the things you do. #KeepitupCorridor.

ps. I know D isn't part of CD, but i want him to know I love him, too.< /review>

<text>Dinosaur Hill Park has been here since I can remember. (1955) It is right in back of the house my Dad built at that time on Random Way. I loved climbing the hill up to the top so I could see the incredible view!!!  I went there December  28th 2018 for the first time since 1960. WOW!!! The day was so clear and the view was just spectacular!!! I took some pictures that I added the photos to this place on Google maps.
The only reasons I didn't give dinosaur Hill Park five stars is because there are no facilities here and it really needs some work for access especially for the handicapped. There is just a dirt path and there are some rickety stairs not to be trusted. This area is not really accessible during the rain or when it's really wet. There is no pavement and and no cement. Just dirt and mud and grass. There is a handicap parking place and the pathway is accessible if it is dry. Another thing I was disappointed in was that people have spray-painted graffiti on the interesting natural rocks and boulders.
Please be respectful of this place<//text>< Pics>

A small park suitable for contemplating and enjoying the view. There are no benches or bathrooms. Trash & recycling available. Great spot for photography.</Text>

One of the last great Lookout points in the area you could see from Walnut Creek all the way to Martinez different spots for different views or one spot where you can see the entire View great places to bring your kids right now it's really green there I have some really good pictures to go along with this. I'll show you the whole thing. If you ever go here I'm sure you'll like it I seen people they're using their electric cars that were having a lot of fun. People just go there to sit and look at the view which is extraordinary sure. There's no way you can get it less than five stars because it's perfect. Straight to walk your dog If you have a dog I like to take places like this if I can find them. I knew about this place for a long time. I have"nt been there in a decade maybe longer. And it's still just as nice as it ever was. 40 years ago there wasn't as many houses around it but it's still pretty much the same. Best view in this area for sure unless you go up on top of Mount Diablo mat be. So enjoy dinosaur Hill bring your dog and your kids it's a great place to have a picnic or just enjoy the sites for a bit. Either way you will enjoy it.</text>

It's a fantastic view point. You can see all the way from Alamo to Martinez. It's a great place to take your dog for a walk or just relax after work. Also great for picnics I would imagine there is some people playing with their electric cars and they were having a ball so that kind of stuff would be fun there. I love taking my dog there he has a ball every time we go. So go and enjoy dinosaur Hill. You won't regret it have a nice day<//review>

I love this park and the view over-looking our beautiful Diablo Valley. I can remember hiking up the narrow stairs with my sister and walking across the rocks away the top and down to the bench to sit and chat. The park closes at dusk but it's small so it doesn't take much time to explore the whole thing anyhow.< /Text>

There is amazing scenery here,  very nice after the rain, but muddy. Shorts bikes and walks are great. The view of the bay area and Mt Diablo is nice. Good for fireworks on the fourth of July.<//Text>

Right after school gets out for the day the kids like to come to the park to get high(or at least whwn I was there). Might be a good spot for sunrise photos or on the 4th of July to watch fireworks< /Review>< pics>

Next to no parking and no shade but that didn't stop the beer drinkers and pot smokers from setting up shop on top of the hill. Hurried and saw the view from the lower trail and got the heck out of there.</Review>

Parking area is very small, fitting up to 5 to 7 cars with 1 handicap spot. The view from the parking lot isn't the best one out there, but it's something.
Once you hike up the hill to the top you can see some great views overlooking contra costa county and Mount Diablo. I love to fly kites here on windy days or on relax in the sun on the warm and sunny days.
A lot of teenagers and the under 25 crowd like to congregate here, especially during the afternoon, evening, and throughout the night. Some of them are only looking for a place to smoke weed etc. Very few are looking for trouble.
But it's never been an issue for me, more of just an observation. Most of the time they are just chillin like you are and have no quams. There's always a bad egg amount the bunch, so don't let that deter you from coming here.<//review>

CCV is an amazing community and a place that I call home! Not only has this church brought me to Christ when I was baptized in 2010 but my husband as well who was just baptized last year in 2018! My kids both love going!  My youngest son is 4 and is special needs and the church provides him with a 1 on 1 buddy so that he can participate in all the Kids Activities while my husband and I enjoy the main service.</Text>

<review>Incredible church! Solid Word-based theology, very community-minded, and great emphases in missions work as well! All the pastors are friendly and great communicators, and the worship is very well done. My wife and I go here whenever we're in town.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

<rate>5</rate><review>❤️ This became our home church after the first time we attended. We had been attending a previous church for 14 years, and the first time we went to CCV the people were so welcoming and made us feel like we belonged. It has now been 2 1/2 years for our family attending this beautiful church where we are able to connect with Jesus and be involved with our community service locally as well as abroad. Loving God and loving others is what we get to do daily through CCV.<//review>< date>

<review>I went to this church in Arizona for 10 years in my youth and teenage years before I left Christianity. It was just the message of the cross and how to be happy. I never heard repentance mentioned once in those 10 years. I was led to believe I could sin as much as I want because I did the sinners prayer. The questions i had the pastors couldn't answer and I ended up leaving Christianity when I was 18 in a search for answers to my questions. CCV will lead you and your children to hell. About 80% of my youth group no longer are Christian today. Fun and Games doesnt prepare you for life and leaves you with a faith paper thin.<//review>< time>

Within 30 minutes of being there, we both felt that this was home. The love and grace that radiated from the people told us that the Spirit was active amongst this body of believers. Christ is at the center of the congregation at CCV. A place where all are welcomed and loved, and where biblical truth is taught in that very love. The Spirit of God is on the move at CCV and I feel incredibly blessed that God brought us here. The greatest Spiritual growth that my husband and I have had has been while we've attended CCV the past 4 years. My daughters and my son have all found their best friends at CCV, and frankly, so have my husband and myself. Doing life together in a community of loving believers is a gift from God, and CCV has mastered that gift. You belong here!< /Text><username>Natalie Specht< /username><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1553725206729, 'text': "What a wonderful testament!

The facility is absolutely amazing.  It is big enough to have a large wedding reception at and yet they can make it small enough for a more intimate setting.  I have DJ several events here from weddings to school dances and it has always been great.  Can' t wait to do another event here.<//text>

<Review>My wife and I have been worshipping at CVV for 15 years. First the San Dimas campas, then Lone Hill, now at Etiwanda since it's opening. We could have not found a better more fulfilling place to hear God's word through Bible based ministry. Our pastors are all awesome! Our volunteers are many and delighted to help all in the glory of God. We are the most welcoming, accepting church of all people no matter what your background or baggage may be. This Easter the Etiwanda campus will be celebrating Christ's resurrection at several Easter services. I encourage all to consider attending and pray for God to bring you to CCV. May you be all blessed.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This is a top notch establishment. Every associate during my visit was extremely hospitable and professional. A special shout out to the two coaches I was fortunate to train with Chris and Jeffrey, both challenged me and gave me a great workout! Matt the GM and Evelyn at the front desk were also especially accommodating for my short visit in San Diego. I highly recommend this gym for anyone looking to take your fitness to the next level and train with the best of the best in Mission Valley. Thanks for everything UFC Gym Mission Valley!<//text>

If you have a note on your door saying you open at 6:00am on Monday the 28th after closing for the whole weekend, you open at 6:00 am Monday the 28th to at the very least be considerate of other people’s time. Very disappointed about this especially and unfortunately not the first time this “gym” has inconvenienced me.<//Text>

I wrote a letter to the manager Matt when the gym opened back up again during covid stating I had To suspend my membership as I lost A business of 15 years, couldn’t afford it and didn’t want to risk being exposed as well. I was Just called by the collection agency for almost $300 when I don’t have the $. This is not a way to do business, they could’ve gotten a return customer, but blew everything.</Text>

The classes are well designed to gain the most benefits out of the daily workouts. There is always parking.

<Text>First day so far. Everyone so friendly but also let you do your own thing. Grateful to the GM for helping make my situation work. Far from overwhelming but extremely challenging and supportive environment. Not too crowded. Really appreciate that they make the childcare hours work. For the amount of people, coach was able to keep an eye on me at my level and help teach me lessons I lacked. Looking forward to this journey together. Thank you for your support in my and my family’s health goals.< /Text><Date>1538487622077</Date>< Rate>

I like all of the employees a lot , but the management is absolutely unacceptable. No one but the GM can cancel your membership if you want out, and so you have to email him. But he never returns your emails. Matt..? Where you at bro?<//review>

Only the best! Trainers are more than qualified. I've had memberships with other clubs and nothing compares to the care that the UFC team puts in with their members</Review>

<date>1569968441072<//date><pics>None</pics><Review>The environment you get here is awesome. It's nothing like a quiet dull 24 hour fitness. It's motivating and fast paced.  Trainers are really cool and knowledgeable. Samantha Pankey has a good line up of workouts and lays everything out in detail, she badd. One of the other awesome trainer here is Paul le! This guy is probably one of the most thorough and well versed trainers I've come a cross. Coming from an athletic background that says a lot. He has helped my lifting technique and shown me plenty of different stretches to keep improving. Thanks guys!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80d9553c1a2661c9:0x8f2463f68cb739fd</Gmap_id><user_name>Freddie Vasquez< /user_name><Rate>5</Rate><Response>None< /Response>< user_id>

Do NOT come here if you wanna learn Muay Thai. Trainer Jhanex almost never explains the technique & half of the time he doesn’t even pay attention to what you’re doing.

When I tried to get my money back for the reason that “absolutely no training was provided”, manager Matt told me that it’s too late & that I paid for gym access & not specifically for Muay Thai classes even though that was the only reason why I signed up for UFC Gym membership.

You’ll be better off going to some local bar & picking a fight with an a-hole who’s bothering someone. This way you’ll get the same quality training absolutely for FREE & possibly a “thank you” if you manage to win. ))</text>

Bought a gi from ufc gym for over $100 and never received it or compensation. Now they are refusing to reimburse me. Gym i had membership with was also closed down. But my membership was transfered to a different location with out notifying me and they continued to bill me with out notifying me as well. They didnt even tell me that my gym was closing down. Stealing from disabled veterans in a military town like san diego is most likely why most of their locations in san diego closed down already.</text>

I highly recommend not going to any of their gyms as staff is only there to make a sale. The classes are just as bad, the coaches dont know how to train and seem like begginers themselves. They have no clientele making classes really small usually 1-3 ppl and sparring near impossible. The only thing they might have going for them is the variety of equipment but even then its very limited. When I tried canceling my membership the guy told me that he did, however a month later I found that they were still charging me. I went back another time and canceled and tried to get a reimbursement and they gave me the run around telling me to contact the guy i had talked to orignally, the district manager Bryan gave me his personal number but has not asnwered his phone or text messages and continues to ignore me. This is suppose to be a bussiness they should have some integrity but they're clearly unprofessional. Again, I highly recommend not even considering walking in. If you are looking for a place to train The arena in point loma or The One training center in la mesa.</Review><Response>None<//Response><Rate>1</Rate><Time>1441044152178</Time></record></dataset><record>

Called a bunch of times to get my passport for something urgent. The calls were accepted but the workers would hang up the moment we were about to be given an appointment. It took us almost a whole day to try and get the calls to work and get at the end of the day we still had no appointment for my passport. Definitely the worst experience my parents and I have ever gone through and I really hope this doors to happen to anyone else. It was really disappointing on how I wasn’t able to be given an appointment just to get my passport when it is urgent. If I could I would give no stars. My family and I already had an appointment in person but they would not give me my passport for not having an identification to present despite being a minor and gm not having a legal identification yet. This is disappointing and frustrating.< /Text>

My husband has been trying to get his paperwork for over 5 years and even tho he provided them with all the forms requested they never help and turn him down. It’s so ridiculous that they don’t help so who do we go to if they are not helping.< /review>

< Review>
Worse service, i have been trying to schedule an appointment for 2 weeks now and everyday go online theyonly show 1 weeks worth of days all say no availability, and calling is so frustating i should sue them for emotional distress, they hang up as soon as you get to the appt portion of the call, they dont help and i need my sons passport as soon as possible.  I really cant beleive this place is managed so poorly regardless of where the call center is they should find a way to make it better.  If call center is horrible at their job than make sure the app works better. Its veen 2 stressfull weeks.< /Review>

Visit Visa experience:

I have applied for a Visit Visa with San Jose Mexican Consulate General and the over all experience was very good. The security was very strict with the appointment time and the staff inside was very good and we came out with visa in 45 mins! Just paid $44 for the visa and all the supporting documents (application form, photo, bank statements etc) and a short interview by the officer. They took another photo inside, finger prints and printed the visa and provided the stamped passport immediately. I found very professional for the visa service.

Now the only downside is getting an appointment for consulate interview! It always shows no appointment and there is no way we can connect to them using the phone as it always go to voicemail. Luckily I found their Facebook page and chatted on the messenger and the operator told me they release the appointments on Tuesday afternoon. I checked on that website (MEXITEL) everyday 5-6 times and one Tuesday afternoon I got two appointments for me and my wife and it quickly gets filled in few minutes !<//Text>

This posting is to inform others of the poor service that is provided to by the Mexican Consulate staff. The overall customer service provided by all staff members is horrible. The main reason for this feedback is because I would to see improvements and changes on the way they are providing services to the people.<//Text>

Super fast and efficient Passport service. Was only there for a couple hours. Good practice of COVID-19 protocols as well. Would give 10 stars if possible.< /Review>

If I could give it 0 stars I would. It takes a long time to get an appointment, and once you do get an appointment, they are very rude. Over the phone they don't tell you all documentation needed for appointment. Then when you show up they dismiss you without resolve.< /text>

I can't seem to make an appointment to renew my passport via the website or by phone, whenever I try it says there are no appointments and it only gives me a two-week span without any possibility of changing it, the same happens if I call. I'm going to try to get there without an appointment (although I'm 95% sure I'll be sent away because of COVID), but at this point I don't know what else to do.</Review>

It was a better experience than last time, much faster and their personal were not as rude as last time so there was improvement to their service. What was a little disappointing is that they only accept cash and there is no ATM available in site or any were near the building I have to drive about 2 miles to find an ATM.</text>

<text>Hello I am leaving this information for those seeking financial aid for DACA. There is no aid at the consulate available as of Jan 21 2020. The representative informed me that the "Mexican Government" was suppose to authorize financial aid for those seeking renewal by January 2 2020 but has failed to do so. I honestly doubt they will approve any aid and instead urge you all to look for non interest loans from Mission Asset Fund if still available or even Catholic charity of choice.

<Text>For the elderly, it's an easier process to go through.

It's really recommended to ask for help alot because it's a total mess there. I had trouble getting from place A to B. There's also presentations going on, which is a mess while you're just trying to ask for help.

Also, please come in prepared by doing your research beforehand. You don't want to wait so much time just to forget something or your paperwork isn't valid. The times are a bit long and it's not worth it.

Staff is average. They really seem like they don't really want to work because they probably deal with people that come in without an appointment and without the necessary documents. Plus, they're dealing with many  passive customers. You shouldn't expect to get the best service possible.

Also, why is there so much tables with businesses promoting their credit and loan services at a government office? It's just a bit unprofessional that those private businesses are in the same office as the consulate.</Text></record>

After calling repeatedly and trying all possible extensions without success, I was finally attended by an unrelated extension.

Instead, since I live in Alameda, I must drive all the way to Fort Bragg while there is no availability in San Francisco. Even so, Mexitel's gives me an appointment under the warning that I might not be able to get the document notwithstanding having plenty of dates open.

I then tried the other offices and ended up with the result. I called the customer service number to schedule an appointment and they hang up on after waiting on the phone for more than an hour . I think am going to just walk in with my document and apply for the visa without an appointment as on one is helping . Also, I sent them an email inquiring about the visa be no one has replied back. I don’t know what to do as I need to book my flight

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Brought my mom to renew her Mexican passport and everything was easy and smooth. Everything is electronic now so you don't need to make copies of anything and you don't need to bring passport photos. I was so relieved as I had heard horror stories.

We had an appointment at 10:00 a.m. and got there at 9:15 a.m. We were seen right away and were done by 10:00 a.m.  Everyone was courteous.<//review>< Pictures>

<name>Elizabeth Castillon< /name><Date>1543293054001< /Date><rate>1</rate><review>I went in with all my required documentation to become a Mexican citizen and was surprised when Rosie  and Maria Luisa began to apparently nit pick my documents to find reasons why I could not become a Mexican citizen.  Both of my Mexican citizen parents were present with their Mexican passports and other ID's.  They began to contradict each other as to why they could not process my request.  At one point Rosie told me I needed to listen to her and when I responded that I was listening she told me I needed to change my attitude!  I politely told her that my attitude had nothing to do with my listening skills, as I was listening.  She was clearly bullying me as her superiority complex got the best of her.  When I asked to speak to her supervisor,  Maria Luisa, she told me that she'd be back with an appointment for tomorrow and when she returned to her office she again said it would not be possible to move forward with my process. When my mother tried to ask her why she had changed her mind again she asked us not to keep disrespecting her and that she and the employees there deserved our respect.  I then asked to speak to her supervisor and was told by her that I had basically given too much documentation!  That if I would have omitted my mother's birth certificate, they could have approved my process.  This makes absolutely NO SENSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I BASICALLY GOT DENIED FOR HAVING TOO MUCH DOCUMENTATION WHILE BOTH MY MEXICAN PARENTS WERE PRESENT! They ARE NOT FOLLOWING THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS BUT PICKING AND CHOOSING WHO TO ASSIST AND WHO TO THROW OUT!  THE LEVEL OF UNPROFESSIONALISM IS UNBELIEVABLE AT BEST!  THIS GANG OF BULLYING WITCHES NEED TO GO!  THE CONSULATE'S JOB IS TO ASSIST THE PUBLIC, BUT THE PUBLIC IS AT THE MERCY OF THESE WITCHES WITH SUPERIORITY COMPLEXES.

The lady who is working on the visa issue are extremely rude and offensive. Even my husband took all the materials that required on the Mexican Consulate website, she denied his visa application.

If I had a chance to rate them anything low, I could definitely do so. Totally Unethical and Unprofessional. They cancelled  my visa appointment for just missing a copy of single passport stamped page. Though I said I could get them in mins, it fell on deaf ears.  Sad!! Disgusting attitude!!</Text>

The website for online appointment making is not flawless but the appointment process in the consulate is quite efficient. I got the new passport renewed in just 1 hour.

No "constancia medica" is required for passport renewal of kids below 3 years old. Nor is photo needed because it will be taken on the spot.</Review>

<Review>It’s been over a month trying to get an appointment to renew my passport. Every time I call they don’t have appointments available. How are we supposed to get our documents processed if they never have appointments available. When i ask the representatives at Mexican Consulate the only answer I get is “keep trying”. Worst service possible.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1555095419493, 'text': '(Translated by Google) We give more than 200 appointments every day, which is all we can attend with the human resources we have. Unfortunately, many people who make an appointment well in advance, do not go on the day they were assigned, nor cancel it, so spaces are lost for people like you.\n\n(Original)\nDamos diariamente más de 200 citas, que es todo lo que podemos atender con los recursos humanos que contamos. Desafortunadamente, muchas personas que hacen cita con mucha antelación, no acuden el día que tenían asignado, ni la cancelan, por lo que se pierden los espacios para personas como usted.'}</Resp><gmap_id>0x808fcbe58062f973:0x7cfd7348d35d6e60<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

One comes on time before appointment and they still don’t respect your appointment, they help you when they feel like it or finish their group conversations.</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I went for a passport renewal, it took me 3 weeks to contact someone, hundreds of calls a nightmare and wasted hours trying to contact someone, finally someone answered, very attentive super professional, the call is redirected to Mexico where you are looking for a date. The consulate of San Francisco absolutely nothing, you can never make an appointment there, the person who helped me got me the appointment in San Jose an hour and a half from where I live, they called me an hour early, I arrived an hour before the Time indicated because I did not know the location or because of any problem on my way to the consulate, when the police officer arrived 👮‍♂️ from the entrance he told me that I had to wait until two, because after two ears 👂 they already let me pass and arriving at the first window and after waiting 25 minutes because there was no one at the window, the lady tells me that it will be 113 dollars for the 6-year passport and it is paid with cash and what kind of cash here in gringoland nobody uses cash I asked him if there was an ATM and they told me that in the cake that I had to go to an ATM, because I already left the line where I waited half an hour to go to an ATM, I drove 10 min to the closest there I lost another 20 minutes , I arrived and since the cop had already seen me, he let me in, I turned to form in the first line and the gentleman attended me immediately, skipping 3 people, he already told me that now I had to sit down and wait for my number, wait another hour until it was my turn, they took my fingerprints 🐾 and the biometric system eyes 👀 I paid I wait another 15 min and finally after almost a month of suffering I got my new passport. Quite a challenge in life. Long live Mexico!! 🤪🥸🤨

Fui por una renovación de pasaporte me tomo 3 semanas en contactar a alguien, cientos de llamadas una pesadilla y pérdida de tiempo horas en tratar de contactar a alguien, finalmente alguien contestó , muy atento súper profesional, la llamada es re direcciónada a Mexico donde te buscan una cita. El consulado de San Francisco de plano nada, jamás puede hacer una cita ahí, la persona que me ayudo me consiguió la cita en San Jose a hora y media de el lugar donde resido, me citaron una hora temprano, llegue una hora antes de la hora indicanda por que no sabía la locación o por cualquier problema en mi camino hacia el consulado, cuando llegue el poli 👮‍♂️ de la entrada me dijo que me tenía que esperar hasta las dos, pues después de dos orejas 👂 ya me dejaron pasar y llegando a la primera ventanilla y después de esperar 25 min por que no había nadie en la ventanilla me dice la doña que van a ser 113 dólares por el pasaporte de 6 años y se paga con cash y pos cuál cash acá en gringoland nadie usa cash le pregunté que si había cajero y me dijeron que nel pastel que Tenia que ir a un cajero, pues ya me salí de la línea en donde espere media hora para ir a un cajero, maneje 10 min al más cercano ahí perdí otros 20 minutos, llegue y como el poli ya me había visto me dejo entrar me volví a formar en la primera línea y el caballero me atendió inmediatamente saltándome 3 personas, ya me dijo que ahora me tenía que sentar y esperar mi número espere otra hora hasta que fue mi turno, me tomaron huellas 🐾 y el sistema biométrico ojos 👀 pagué espero otros 15 min y por fin después de casi un mes de sufrir obtuve mi nuevo pasaporte. Todo un reto de la vida. Viva Mexico!! 🤪🥸🤨<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The trip from Sacramento to San José was wonderful ... they take care of you quickly ... clear with the hygiene and safety protocols. The reason ... well in Sac. There is no availability. And fewer appointments. So I requested it here in San José and I came on an excursion. The bad thing that they didn't give me the license plate because I'm not from that area .... what details !! 🤔

<text>(Translated by Google) I have 3 weeks trying to get an appointment on the mexitel internet site, they do not give me a date when there is an appointment on the phone they do not answer and if I show up without an appointment they will not attend to me I do not understand why the procedures always have to be so cumbersome s then they do not accept pure cash card hehehe very suspicious I do not trust I think it will be easier to become a US citizen than to get a Mexican passport 🤔🤔🤔🤔

Tengo 3 semanas tratando de obtener cita        en el sitio de internet mexitel no me da fecha cuando hay cita     en teléfono no contestan y si me presento sin cita 💯 no me van  atender no entiendo porque los trámites siempre tienen que ser tan engorroso s luego no aceptan tarjeta puro dinero al contado jejeje muy sospechoso no confio creo que va a ser más fácil hacerme ciudadano estadounidense que sacar un pasaporte mexicano 🤔🤔🤔🤔< /text><user_name>temo rodriguez<//user_name></record>

(Translated by Google) Almost two months without being able to make a simple appointment, It is incredible. The staff is so incompetent, and so rude that they are embarrassed. They treat their own people so badly. Not even those of the dmv, who treat more people in one day than those of the consul in a year. If anyone knows of someone we can turn to to get these people online, please let them know. Complaints that one does not even look.

(Translated by Google) My review was deleted haha ​​... As I said before, call one, and either they hang up the phone, or they take you to the main menu like 50 times. In the first review I left, they answered me to schedule online today Tuesday, and nothing! they do not answer! it is impossible to schedule an appointment !! what rights do we have? none if I have been wanting to make an appointment for months and nothing !!

Edit: I had to fly to Phoenix Arizona since they only dated there. You may want to consider moving out of the Bay Area since I tried for more than two months to schedule an appointment without success.

(Translated by Google) They do not answer, the answering machine does not work, it returns you to the main menu, and they have been like this all year 2021, when they answer they say that there are no appointments and that they do not know when there are new ones, it is sad to see that even the Mexican consulate in the United States worth seeing ...

(Translated by Google) How is it that all the people have reviews from a week or a month ago saying that everything is very fast if I have 2 months talking and they are not dating! Will the same staff be giving good reviews? I occupy an emergency op7 someone who can let me know which consulate attends without appointment or if they are open! Thank you By the way before the pandemic I went for a procedure and it is quite far from my home so twice I asked for information and they told me what they occupy but they did not mention the birth certificates that they do so that you pay them there and they are not nothing economical by the way you can only pay in cash !!!

(Original)
Como es que toda la gente tiene reseńas de una semana atras o 1 mes diciendo que todo muy rapido si yo tengo 2 meces hablando y no estan dando citas! Sera el mismo personal dando buenas reseńas ?? Ocupo una op7 de urgencia alguien que me pueda hacer saber cual consulado atiende sin sita o si estan abiertos ! Gracias Por cierto antes de la pandemia fui por un tramite y esta bastante lejos de mi casa asi que dos veces pedi informacion y me dijeron que lo que ocupan pero no mencionaron las actas de nacimiento eso lo hacen para que las pagues ahi mismo y no son nada economicas por cierto solo se puede pagar en efectivo !!!<//Review>

However, we have not stopped working since mid-May. On the contrary, we increase services on some Saturdays to serve as many people as possible, despite the fact that we continue in a pandemic. On the other hand, I inform you that there are still appointments available today in case you like to make your appointment before they are sold out.

<Review>(Translated by Google) After almost 4-5 months, the civil registry of San Jose has here since June sending me to the civil registry of Mexico, because a father already fellecio and my parents were not married, Mexico told me that I needed a power of attorney from someone in Mexico, I am going to take the letter to a notary with two witnesses and the person who is going to give me the letter tells me it is not correct because with only the records of his aunt it is the relationship of his aunt and his father, I get to us I speak to the consulate from Mexico to say this they tell me call the registry where his father was born, at last morelia direct us with the correct dept in San Francisco they said everything correct that it says on the page of the ai consulate, abide by parents, if a father does not Live just death certificate, credential of one, or passport of one, IDs of your witnesses and you comply with the ID, and if you are married, take your certificate too, perfect I call the nexital center for the same question that I need to say exactly the same If they weren't married it doesn't matter just with Their minutes check their nationality of them Mexicans, and you have to bring photo copies of the id of two witnesses, they do not have to be present, I said wow finally I grabbed something that will work, but I said no, there is a appointment for San Jose, call until ayga ok I said, did I happen to call them direct to ask if they are going to close the sites? That they believe very disappointed I start a new civil registry tells me that I have to do it in Mexico, that because a father has already died and they were not married, I told him fart they said this and this but for everything no no no, when everyone is saying that San Jose Is this wrong more than one on the web? So here is a big problem if this is all on the web? but talk to a lawyer? Why is it a problem to make me this appointment after almost 4 months? sjo civil registry report is seen because what they are saying is not the same as it says on the sf consulate website, and their girls see that everything has to be as they say it

(Translated by Google) Just because I can't give zero stars, but they are a terrible representation of Mexico abroad and a shame for the SRE. My husband went to apply for a visa for Mexico. He went to the facilities and they were closed. They never informed him. We rescheduled the appointment and this time I went with him. At the time of reviewing her paperwork, the lady threw the papers at her (they even fell on the floor, I saw him) saying that she will return when she had complete documentation and the woman left. And without giving any guidance or instructions of the necessary documentation (it should, since a foreigner does not know what is needed more than what is on the web). of course my husband got angry and so did I. And the lady at the entrance, another pedantic, said that she did not know the reasons for the lady in the interview but that my husband had to come to another interview and that she was not sure if they were going to give him the visa because, like my husband had bothered after being attacked. Maybe they were going to make him go 3 times and still weren't sure if they were going to give it to him. (Yes, he said that in his mocho Spanish). I got home and read all the bad reviews on Google and was very sad to see so many bad reviews. I called the foreign relations line to make the complaint and made an appointment at the San Francisco consulate. We went and the SF consul was most friendly. He told him that his documents seemed to be in order (yes, we brought exactly the same ones that we had brought to the appointment in SJ). He took out a sheet and marked with text marks that my husband did not need a visa because he is an American resident. How is it possible that the people at the embassy in San José have never told him that and that they continue to have a position to which they are arrogant and rude, believing they have the power to mistreat people? I know that my Mexico is full of noble people with good hearts and we are super receptive to foreigners. The SRE invests millions each year in attracting tourism to Mexico. Well, it seems that this embassy is unaware of all that. They should actually clean up and put people who actually want to work and not just go get paid. In the reviews, there are too many people complaining about the staff (and if the river sounds ...) I tell my compatriots that if they have to go to an embassy for a better procedure, they should drive or take the BART to SF. Experience is another level. I hope the SRE can do something about it.

(Original)
Sólo por que no puedo dar cero estrellas, pero son una pésima representación de México en el extranjero y una vergüenza para la SRE. Mi esposo fue a solicitar una visa para México. Acudió las instalaciones y estaban cerradas. Jamás le informaron. Volvimos a agendar la cita y esta vez fui yo con él. Al momento de revisar su papeleo la señorita le aventó los papeles (hasta calleron en el piso, yo lo vi) diciendo que regresará cuando tuviera documentación completa y se salió la mujer. Y sin dar ninguna guía o instrucciones de la documentación necesaria (debería, ya que un extranjero no sabe lo que se necesita más lo que está en la web). por su puesto mi esposo se enojó y yo también.  Y la señorita de la entrada ,otra pedante más, dijo que no sabia razones de la señorita de la entrevista pero que mi esposo tenia que venir a otra entrevista y que no estaba segura si le iban a dar la visa por que como mi esposo se había molestado después de haber sido agredido. Tal vez lo iban a hacer ir 3 veces y aun así no sgaban seguros de si se la iban a dar. (si, eso lo dijo en su español mocho). Llegue a casa y leí todos los malos reviews en Google y me dio mucha tristeza ver tantos reviews malos. Hablé a la línea de relaciones exteriores para hacer la queja y pedí una cita en el consulado de San Francisco. Fuimos y el consul de SF fue de lo más amable. Le dijo que sus documentos parecían estar en orden (si, llevamos exactamente los mismos que habíamos llevado a la cita en SJ) Saco una hoja y marcó con marcatextos que mi esposo no necesitaba una visa por que es residente americano. Cómo es posible que la gente de la embajada en San José jamas le haya dicho eso y que sigan teniendo un puesto al cual son altanero y groseros, creyéndose con el poder de maltratar a las personas? Yo se que mi México esta lleno de gente noble con buen corazón y somos súper receptivos a los extranjeros. La SRE invierte cada año millones en atraer turismo a México. Pues parece que en esta embajada desconocen todo eso. Deberían en realidad hacer una limpia y poner a gente que en realidad quiera trabajar y no solo ir a cobrar. En los reviews, hay demasiada gente quejándose del personal (y si el rio suena...) a mis compatriotas les digo que si tienen que acudir a alguna embajada por un tramite mejor manejen o tomen el BART a la de SF. La experiencia es otro nivel. Espero la SRE pueda hacer algo al respecto.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Good service, fast and punctual.
Arrive early for your appointment but do not line up, the line is made 5 minutes before and only the person who requires the service takes all your documents and if your document is lost or lost or stolen, take your police report, they will not attend you If you don't have it, THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH.

(Translated by Google) This was 4 months ago: How terrible I went to get my registration and passport because my bag was stolen and they asked me for the police report, I came back with the report and they want two photo IDs to verify that it is I gave them one and they did not want Because it is mistreated and they want one that is current, they have me like this for 4 months. I only need a consular registration and they tell me one thing and another return with what they ask for and they leave with another, they are only playing as the Mexican consulted and Mexicans do not help. of not playing with people and agreeing on what they ask, some say one thing and then others ask for different roles, that courage to go out without anything and be there for a long time waiting for me to be denied a consular registration.

Today July 21: and I went to the Mexican consulate to process my registration, take all the papers that asked me for everything until the report and an ID that they asked me for and told me that it did not matter that it was expired but that it had my photo and name as it appears in My birth certificate, whatever it takes, they accepted the papers and they took my picture and to finish they told me what to pay at the cash desk and the lady who was there charged me and asked for the papers which I read and she said not to I was going to give my registration because the ID was expired and was from another state and that if I lived there in that state that needed a valid ID not expired, the truth was that the lady was angry and took her courage in not giving me my registration, I just ask that I give a consular registration because I need it I asked to steal my bag and be wasting time with people who just take their courage out please try to understand that they are Mexicans you also believe me that I am struggling so they can give me The consular registration that they are going to ask me the most is sad to deny something that one needs and you deny it if you take what you ask for and leave with more things every day, it is not free to behave like this with one and take time to attend and with your Angry face and bad mood deny you registration. Today 07/21/20

Hoy  21 de julio: y fui al consulado mexicano a tramitar mi matrícula lleve todo los papeles que me pidieron todo hasta el reporte y una ID que me pidieron y me dijieron que no importaba que estuviera vencida pero que tuviera mi foto y nombre como aparece en mi acta de nacimiento lo cual le lleve me aceptaron los papeles y me tomaron la foto ya para terminar me dijieron que pasa a caja a pagar y la señora que estaba ahí me cobro y me pidió los papeles lo cual ledi y me dijo que no me hiba a dar mi matrícula por que la ID estaba vencida y era de otro estado y que si viví ahí en ese estado que necesitaba una ID válida no vencida la verdad estaba enojada la señora y desquitó su coraje en no dándome mi matrícula solamente pido que me den una matrícula  consular porque la necesito yo pedí que me robaran mi bolsa y estar perdiendo el tiempo con gente que solo desquitar su coraje por favor traten de entender que son mexicanos ustedes también créanme que estoy batallando para que me puedan dar la matrícula consular que más me van a pedir que triste es negar algo que uno necesita y ustedes lo niegan si lleva lo que piden y salen cada día con más cosas no es gratis para que se porten así con uno y tardan para atender y con su cara de enojada y de mal humor te niegan la matrícula.

{'time': 1580506708771, 'text': '(Translated by Google) Dear user, I am sorry if you had a bad experience trying to schedule an appointment. At the Consulate General of Mexico in San José we serve a population close to one million people, that is a much larger number than the entire population of several cities in Mexico and the United States. Daily we serve more than 235 people with scheduled appointments. As soon as they are sold out we open new ones. This may take a few hours, but we try to reduce it so that appointments are always available. I remind you that Mexitel, in addition to the phone number 1-877-6394835 has a page where you can also schedule your appointment page: https://mexitel.sre.gob.mx/citas.webportal/pages/public/login/login .jsf.

(Translated by Google) You take an appointment to be attended to but no questions are available until when and they don't know they just say you keep calling to see when they have. Also x the answer that I received from the consulate today 01-31-20 I tell the consulate that this did not happen about two or 3 years ago and they attended the same number of people or not?

(Translated by Google) Your website is useless, you are trying to make appointments and it never works, they ask you for phones and email you write it and it says that it is not correct and they already have years like that, every time you need to do paperwork it is a nightmare for those who need a document or registration I cannot believe that they are not aware of so many failures in so long they never review their reviews, I would give them zero stars for their lousy service.

(Translated by Google) They should hire new people to save what they are doing. They gave me an appointment and drove 40 minutes. They told me that I couldn't get my license without a police order.
I ordered and they told me that it was not possible because I had already lost my registration 2 times when nobody informed me that at the beginning according to their laws they changed something that in the
First date I was not informed, asen impossible to give a document! Always the
Majority with its bitter face! They do not like their work look for another one, I see that until the owner does not accept bad reviews! Imagine who we can go to! What a misfortune

In fact, the April and May appointments are sold out due to this great demand. Every day we serve more than 250 people with scheduled appointment.\n\nThe June appointments are not yet open because we have the experience that when they make an appointment several weeks ahead, they forget it, do not show up and only take away the opportunity for someone else to receive that service. If you have an emergency and cannot wait for the June appointments (the second week of May) to open, come to the Consulate, explain your emergency and the Consul will assess whether care is provided or scheduled for a later date.

(Translated by Google) Our consulate has a reputation for being terrible in service for the first time I experience and resent the ineptitude of our public servants in this unit, I made an appointment to process my voting credential at 10:30 in the morning today, at Arriving I find the news that my appointment was at 10:00 in the morning and that therefore it had been canceled, for which I asked to speak to the consul who was apparently very busy and after an hour and insisted to speak with him he left From his very arrogant office to only confirm that they will not attend me because the inept people from mexitel made my appointment at the wrong time.
We all deserve to be served efficiently because it is thanks to our contributions that they are employed.

Nuestro consulado tiene una fama de ser terrible en servicio por primera vez experimento y me molesta la ineptitud de nuestros servidores públicos de esta dependencia, hice una cita para tramitar mi credencial para votar a las 10:30 de la mañana el día de hoy, al llegar me encuentro con la novedad de que mi cita era a las 10:00 de la mañana y que por consiguiente se había cancelado por lo cual pedí hablar con el cónsul que aparentemente estaba muy ocupado y después de una hora e insistir hablar con el salio de su oficina muy arrogante para solo confirmarme que no me atenderán por que los ineptos de mexitel hicieron mi cita a la hora equivocada.
Todos merecemos ser atendidos con eficiencia por que es gracias a nuestras contribuciones ellos tienen empleo.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The consulate in San José is the most degrading. The employees treat you as if they were doing you a favor, they forget that they are paid to give us the service. And do not say to speak to do a procedure, first they last hours in answering and when they do not even cost with the information that one needs. What a frustrating!!!

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very bad service, extremely slow, they spend the time walking through the corridors with the coffee rate. Service windows # 3 and # 6 were the only two people who were attending more quickly, while the others attended two people in an average of 2 hours. I brought my parents by appointment on May 1, 2019 at 2:30 to renew their passport and we left at 5:00.

I was told by the consulate that my father was seen at 3pm and they handed him the document at approximately 3:40, if it is true BUT ONLY to my father. The process of my mom took much longer and we left shortly before 5pm and also her appointment was at 2:30. To my dad just for being a person over 60 if they attended him quickly but in general with other people very slow.

Traje a mis papás con cita el 1 de Mayo 2019 a las 2:30 para renovar pasaporte y salimos a las 5:00.

Me respondieron del consulado diciendo que a mi papa lo atendieron a las 3pm y le entregaron el documento aproximadamente a las 3:40, si es verdad PERO SOLO a mi papa. El proceso de mi mama tomo mucho mas tiempo y salimos poco antes de las 5pm y tambien su cita fue a las 2:30.

<text>(Translated by Google) The treatment that one receives, within the consulate I must admit that it has improved a lot in recent years, but the system they use to make appointments is terrible, they are tape recorders, one follows the instructions, we wait for more than 20 minutes and at the end it is cut off. the call. They should fix that, for that they receive a lot of money from the government and also the services we receive are not free, that's where I entrust them.

(Translated by Google) What a bad time people have in the Mexitel service ... yesterday I tried to make an appointment and they told me that after 3 o'clock and today a Mrs. Adriana valzavares answered me and something like that ... everything bothered Mrs. ... above all I am struck by the fact that they are there to help you make an appointment ... and they do everything possible to refuse you ... I am impressed with what kind of training they receive because their service is very bad ... in the end the Mrs. could not give an appointment because they are full all month ... the truth is that a shame that the consulates and their representatives remind us how horrible our country is in the government ... that they have people who are only there working for leverage
or for money ... because for the pleasure of their work I doubt it ... these people are far from having a customer service at the level of where they are ... and sadly when you go to the consulate the employees are the same (here in San Jose Ca) ... how badly do Mexicans look in this country and if they don't take a look at the reviews of other people who are not Mexican ... what a shame ... 😤😠

(Original)
Que mal rato hacen pasar las personas en el servicio Mexitel...ayer trate de hacer cita y me dijeron que despues de las 3 y hoy llame y me contesto una Sra Adriana valzavares o algo asi...todo le molestaba a la sra...sobretodo me llama la atencion que estan ahi para ayudarte a hacer una cita..y hacen lo imposible por negartela...me impresiona que tipo de entrenamiento reciben porque su servicio es muy malo...al final la Sra no me pudo dar cita que porque estan llenos todo el mes...la verdad que pena que los consulados y sus representantes nos recuerden lo horrible que es nuestro pais en el gobierno...que tengan gente que solo estan ahi trabajando por palanca
o por dinero...porque por gusto a su trabajo lo dudo...estas personas estan lejos de tener un servicio al cliente a la altura de donde estan...y tristemente cuando vas al consulado los empleados igual (aqui en San Jose Ca)...que mal hacen quedar a los mexicanos en este pais y si no echenle un vistazo a los reviews de las otras personas que no son mexicanas...que pena...😤😠</Text>

(Translated by Google) What a shame, today I went to process my consular card, and the guadia told me to fill out that sheet, put your information and form on the red line, so I did, by accident I dropped the paper where I put my information, and I realize that on the back there was a survey, about the service of the staff of the Mexican embassy, ​​because all the questions were already X marked where it says excellent service, and for a moment I thought that someone had already filled out that survey and went for another sheet, and surprise all were already marked with the highest score, very good service, excellent service, and I was not left with the doubt and other people who were waiting there I said answered the survey what is on the back of the sheet? And they say no, they turn the page and they don't even tell me, I had given me what a survey was, but it is already answered, that if some were marked with red color, and others with blue, I say to mislead😉, what a shame everything They do in a corrupt, dishonest way, and of course the service is lousy, but the loyalty is the treatment, the way they look at you and talk to you.

Qué vergüenza, hoy fuí a tramitar mi tarjeta consular, y el guadia me dijo llene esa hoja, ponga su información y formese en la línea roja, así lo hice, por accidente se me cayó el papel dónde puse mi información, y me doy cuenta qué en el reverso había una encuesta, acerca del servicio del personal de la embajada Méxicana, pués todas la preguntas ya estaban X marcadas dónde dice exelente servicio, y por un momento pensé que alguién ya había llenado esa encuesta y fuí por otra hoja, y sorpresa todas ya estaban marcada con la puntuación más alta, muy buen servicio, exelente servicio, y no me quedé con la duda y otras personas qué estaban ahí esperando les dije  contestó la encuesta qué está en la parte de atrás de la hoja?  y me dicen no, voltean la hoja y me dicen ni cuenta me había dado qué había una encuesta, pero ya está contestada, eso si unas estaban marcadas con color rojo, y otras con azul, digo para despistar😉 , que pena qué todo lo hacen de una manera corrupta, deshonesto , y porsuesto qué el servicio es pésimo, pero más pésimo es el trato, la forma cómo te miran y te hablan.< /Text>

It hurts that the people who attend us at the Consulate of Mexico in San Jose are so uncompromising, closed-minded, and instead of trying to help you expedite your process, it's the opposite! The people who attend by phone also do not help, they do not know well the information or requirements that one needs, the person who attended to me told me that my birth certificate is altered, just because it is written in handwritten at the time when I was born!

Da lastima que la gente que nos atiende en el Consulado de Mexico en San Jose sea tan intransigente, cerrada de mente, y en lugar de tratar de ayudarte para agilizar tu trámite es todo lo contrario! las personas que atienden por telefono tampoco ayudan, no saben bien la informacion o requisitos que uno necesita, la persona que me atendio me dijo que mi acta de nacimiento esta alterada, solo porque esta escrita en manuscrita en el tiempo cuando naci! es increible tanta mala atencion en ese lugar, hagan algo por favor!<//Review><rate>1< /rate><gmap_id>0x808fcbe58062f973:0x7cfd7348d35d6e60<//gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) The consulate has employees with very little kindness to customer service. They can be rude and don't help without being desperate or treating customers as if they were less human beings than they. My mother was treated poorly and in my observations most of the simple people were treated as less. Also the telephone service is too slow it took me several days to make an appointment. I hope and truth do more respect, kindness and better treatment for simple people who discriminate against their social status or their appearance.

(Original)
El consulado tiene empleados con muy poca amabilidad con el servicio al cliente. Pueden ser rudos  y no ayudan sin estar desesperados  o tratando a los clientes como si fueran menos seres humanos que ellos. A mi mama la trataron mal y en mis observaciones a la mayoria de la gente sencilla la trataban como menos.  Tambien el servicio telefonico es demaciado lento me tomo varios dias para hacer un cita. Espero y verdad haiga mas respeto, amabilidad y mejor trato para la gente sencilla que se descrimina por su estatus social o por su apariencia.</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The consulate has always offered me good service, it always informed me what documents I need before going because for security if some document is missing they will not give me the service, but there is so much Welferera race, that they believe that because they are Mexican they have to be given everything they need, and if not, they get to say indirect very much to their rude style, if it were in the offices of the DMV or Immigration there or peep they say, there I would like to see them screaming! I give 5 stars to the good service and help that the consulate of my country Mexico has given me in the United States,

(Translated by Google) I went to the Mexican Consulate today to renew my Consular Registration. Although the service in general was much faster than 5 years ago and my experience in particular was not so bad, unfortunately I witnessed as the person in front of me, did not have the same fate as me. This person was trying to renew his passport, but unfortunately he had to go first with the "All Powerful".
The Almighty is the person who is at the front desk and who is responsible for reviewing the documentation and who apparently has ALL THE POWER to decide who to help or provide the service and who does not. And not only that, this "Privileged Being" also has among its powers to determine what documents one has to present in order to continue with the process.
Sï ël decides that the documentation you submit is not correct, or in the case of the person who was in front of me, if your name differs from an S instead of a Z. He has the power to say that you are not who You say you are and that you have to present extra documentation to refute your saying.
It is indeed regrettable that even though we are on this side of the border, bureaucratism is still part of the Mexican idiosyncrasy.

(Original)
Acudí hoy al Consulado Mexicano para renovar mi Matricula Consular. Aunque el servicio en general fue mucho mas rápido que hace 5 anos y mi experiencia en particular no fue tan mal, lamentablemente presencie como la persona que estaba enfrente de mi, no tuvo la misma suerte que yo. Esta persona trataba de renovar su pasaporte, pero desafortunadamente tuvo que pasar primero con el "Todo Poderoso".
El Todo Poderoso es la persona que se encuentra en el escritorio frontal y que se encarga de revisar  la documentación y que aparentemente tiene TODO EL PODER de decidir a quien ayudar o prestar el servicio y a quien no. Y no solo eso,  este "Ser Privilegiado" también tiene en entre sus poderes el determinar que documentos tiene uno que presentar en orden de poder continuar con el tramite.
Sï ël decide que la documentación que presentas no es la correcta, o en el caso de la persona que estaba enfrente de mi, si tu nombre difiere de una S en lugar de una Z. El tiene el poder de decir que tu no eres quien dices ser y que tienes que presentar documentación extra para refutar su dicho.
De veras que es lamentable que aun que estemos de este lado de la frontera, el burocratismo no deja de ser parte de la idiosincrasia del mexicano.<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) We went to the Mexican consulate in San Jose (Today, Monday, July 1, 2013 at 11am) and the truth is that they treat you so badly and apart from receiving pay for that. It is well known that Mexican customer service is very poor in terms of quality, at least usually. As for the Mexican consulate in San Jose, I have no words to describe the girl (young, short-haired brunette) who attends to you entering that apart from not having the necessary paciensia to explain the process we occupy, I end up THREATING with which we would demand or fine to continue insisting on wanting to get our passport. The name of the girl will be revealed only to the competent authorities hoping that her replacement or / or training for a better job performance will be added. It is understood that working with the public can be stressful but each case is and MUST be TREATY as "unique" since it requires respect and patience by individual.

(Original)
Fuimos al consulado de mexico en san jose (Hoy Lunes 1ro Julio 2013 a las 11am) y la verdad que mal que lo traten a uno tan mal y aparte que reciban paga por eso. es bien sabido que el servicio al cliente del mexiciano es muy pobre encuanto a calidad, almenos por lo regular. En cuanto al consulado mexicano en san jose, no tengo ni palabras para describir a la muchacha (joven, morena de estatura baja) que te atiende entrando que aparte de no contar con la paciensia necessaria para explicar el processo que ocupamos seguir, nos termino AMENAZANDO con que nos demandaria o multaria de seguir insitiendo en querer sacar nuestro passaporte. El nombre de la muchacha sera rebelado solamente a las autoridades compententes esperando que se aga su remplazo u/o capacitacion para un mejor desempeño laboral. Se comprende que el trabajar con el publico puede ser estresante pero cada caso es y DEBER ser TRATADIO como "unico" puesto que requiere del respeto y paciensia por individual.< /text>< pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) What a pity that we have such a low level of service, that the truth is that the Mexican consulate brought a bit of Mexico LITERALLY because they also brought the same HORRIBLE service they offer there.
They make you feel like they are doing you a favor, I can not believe that these people who work and live in the United States continue with that poor mentality.
And I do not admire them so much if not the IDIOTA that hires them, AAA but that IDIOTA loves to be called a lawyer or call him for the title that I BUY online.
As my grandfather used to say if you want to know LOOSE AND GOOD FOR NOTHING just go to a government office and collect them there ....
PLEASE do not make us see the rest of MEXICANS as UNUSUAL if you are so good but the demos are not .....

(Original)
Que lastima que tengamos un servicion de tan bajo nivel, que bárbaros la verdad el consulado Mexicano se trajo un pedacito de Mexico LITERALMENTE porque tambien se trajeron el mismo HORRIBLE servicio que ofrecen alla.
Te hacen sentir como que te están haciendo un favor, no puedo creer que estas personas que trabajan y viven en Estados Unidos sigan con esa mentalidad tan pobre.
Y no me admiro tanto de ellos si no del IDIOTA que los contrata, AAA pero ese IDIOTA  le encanta que le digan abogado o lo llamen por el titulo que COMPRO por internet.
Como decía mi abuelo si quieres conocer FLOJOS Y BUENOS PARA NADA solo ve a una oficina de gobierno y allí los coleccionan....
POR FAVOR no nos hagan ver a los al resto de MEXICANOS como INUTILES si ustedes lo son pues que bueno pero los demos no lo somos.....<//review><pics>None<//pics>< rate>

<review>(Translated by Google) The only thing I complain about is the staff at the entrance. I went to process some papers and when they arrived they looked at you with contempt, as if you were giving them a vase !! In addition, it is pathetic that being a Mexican consulate, they want to question you in English.

(Original)
