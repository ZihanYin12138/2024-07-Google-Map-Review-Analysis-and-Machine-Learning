Safe place to live,  but mainly due to its isolation. Lots of nice trees ( slated for removal), beautiful lawn, they had torn up a few years ago leaving sand and weeds.
Good place for cats, having all that sand to poop in. Rent is affordable. 24/7 sounds of freeway 99!!!< /Review>

It’s really nice and clean. And GINA, the manager here, is very warm to the guests and the service is very good. Because I am a foreigner with poor English ability, and I am using a travel trailer for the first time, thanks to the help of GINA, I can move in smoothly, so I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to GINA!</Review>

It's  tricky to see the exit the first time so slow down when you know you're close or you'll  have to circle back.< /Review><Name>Diana Hammer< /Name>< pictures>

If you need a quick place to stay overnight it's just off the 99 on Golden State and it's probably cheap enough. But you must be fully self-contained with your own drinking water, bathroom & showers it's a OK place to stay.
BUT...
If you have any valuables or anything unattached or not locked down
Don't stay here.
Lots of homeless, addicts & theft near by.</Review>

<review>We are new tenants really appreciated park manager she was very helpful and through with all rules and regulations and answering all of our questions we agree with the rules and appreciate them in place we are excited to see their vision come into play as the rest of the long term tenants begin to comply and take pride in where they live. The park has been very peaceful and even though there are children there they seem to be in control.  The grounds staff is right on it not lagging at all and there to help solve problems and questions. Hang tough site manager we see great things coming with your help.  And to the long term residence change is not always easy but can really be best when wanting better for ourselves  p.s. the facilities are kept very clean which is a big plus we recommend this RV park for long or short stays.

My wife and I are not from Fresno, but our son goes to Fresno State and we like to stay near him for a month or two throughout the year(he doesn't feel the same way).  We take our RV here to avoid the costs of hotels.  Its a quiet place and the showers and pool seems to be cleaned fairly often.  After checking out the other parks, this one seemed to be the best value so far in the Fresno area.<//Review>

To get here is a nightmare because of construction, the owners worried what our RV looked like since it is 10 years old and our RV looks nice and the trailers here are trashy looking. We can't  use the pool you have to be a permanent resident I guess with a key, they parked us near a old trailer, that had all kinds of junk around it and all we got was electric cause water cost more. UNBELIEVABLE,  if you are traveling find a nicer park where you get all facilities,  NOT THIS PARK.< /Review>

RV usage:
For the pricing it's decent for a monthly rate. Have found it to be safe here.
Wifi is decent from my experience.
Maintenance folks respond quickly to issues.
Half RV park and half mobile home park.
Not a new park, but it's not trashy.
A mix of RVers mostly for work related longer stays.
Area can be noisy at night; frequent trains (q1h almost) and proximity to freeway.
Neighbors are generally quiet at night.<//text>

Yea......don't move here unless your really desperate. It just went under new management and the manager threatened all his tenants that he'd call CPS if he saw any children outside of their lots. And gave everyone with outside dogs fines from the SPCA. Also the drug people there are true, but there is also lots of small Mexican families... Just, don't go unless its out of desperation.<//text>

Not a great park, no bathrooms that you can use, the manager is only here three day's a week and if she is not here she will not pick up the phone, the man that's work in the park  just don't care he lives out side of the park, he will not do anything for you.<//Review>

< Review>
Well, this is my first and last time at this location. Quality control is -5 stars. My husband found a whole fly at the bottom of his Southwest Salad. I jokingly said “I should check mine now” although I ordered a Cobb salad—low and behold, I found one in mine too 🤢 except half of its body is missing. I probably ate it in the midst of my hangriness. So TWO DIFFERENT salads had a fly in them.

We bought a total of 5 salads that we now have to comb through since we’re home. I’m really disappointed in the lack of quality control here, this is the first time we’ve ever found a bugs in our food ordering take out — and it’s unfortunate it had to be from chick-fil-a since their salads are so good :(<//Review>

Absolute worst chick-fil-a I have ever been to. Inconsistency in service and ability to order compared to others I've been to nation wide.</text>

You better hope they dont mess up your order. You cant call to get help with it. Ordered grilled chicken and got fried. Total let down on after service.  I'll return  but I'll be double and triple checking  my order before  I leave< /review>

This chick fil a is new, but so beautiful and clean! I think the workers are still trying to get a handle on how to get orders out because it took about 45 minutes to get our food. The workers were also not chick fil a nice yet. I think they were flustered about orders and everything! But obviously these things will get better with time! Thanks chick fil a for coming to yucaipa!</review>

I was in line by 10:10am and  when I got up to order breakfast through the drive through it was 10:32am and they would not take my order for breakfast!!!!! So I talked to the manager at the pull up window and he couldn't do anything about it.  I decided to order sandwiches instead but he wanted me to go back through the drove through line.

Drive thru ordering was a breeze, love the cooling water misters and shade provided at the drive-thru menu.  Food was great (as it is at all Chick-fil-A's).
First time trying the Peach shake, we would definitely order again. Was disappointed when we got home and realized they gave us a Strawberry Shake, instead of the Frosted Lemonade we had ordered. The Strawberry Shake was good, just not the flavor we were craving (mistakes happen).
Great food, convenient location and great employees...we will be back.< /Text>< pics>

Staff was not friendly in addition to being snarky. I was in line for breakfast and the cut off was at 10:30. I got to the person at 10:30 and they said no more breakfast. Extremely frustrating when you get there on time and they say no more
At least the manager was kinda enuff to listen to me.< /Text>

<review>My first time at this shop was today, met and got my cut from Jameson absolutely quality work, amazing atmosphere and serious passion behind this place. From the art on the walls, the conversation that flows through, the attention to detail and making the effort to make customers feel comfortable this place does not disappoint. Will be coming back as a customer for life.< /review>< Rate>

<Review>For the last 22 years my job has moved me all over the country. I've been going to 1927 for the last 3 years and this is hands down the best barber shop I have ever been to. No matter what chair you're sitting you will get an outstanding cut from a skilled barber. The music is always awesome and the beer is free. Give 'em a shot, you won't regret it.< /Review>< resp>

It's laid back like the classic feel. You feel like friends when you walk in. Great time and effort on hair cuts. They use razor blade. And the full treatment for a good price</Review>

Saturday and Sunday can get busy with walk-ins, so make an appointment during the week. I recommend this place to everyone I meet.

This is an excellent barber shop! Great conversation and beers(by the customers) were flowing and it was an overall great experience! My haircut and beard trim by Johnny was on point! I will return again and again while in the area! Keep it up 1927 Barber Shop & Shave!<//Text>

This place has a great atmosphere and great staff. Johnny was the one who gave my husband a haircut and beard trim. My husband has a hard time letting people trim his beard since so many people don't know how, and we were both super pleased with the outcome and the price for it all!
We are brand new to the area and will definitely be back.< /Text>

My son has longer hair and super picky about what it looks like. I've gone to almost every person here and they have all done a great job and listened to what he wants. We have tried a lot of places and they have even started shaving his hair off. I'm super glad I've found these guys!!<//Text>

Good group of guys cutting hair - feels like coming into a conversation amongst friends every time I come in. The cuts themselves are excellent, primarily with scissors vs trimmers, and they all know how to straight-edge shave. Walk-ins welcome on some days (call to check), and they have beer for the over-21 crowd, 1 free with a cut. I'm certainly stoked to have a regular place again.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Started taking my boys there for cuts, then my husband for shaves. All the barbers are polite and professional AND they take their time with the cuts which the end result speaks for itself. My family has never walked out displeased. 1927 has become a favorite and a must for my boys and husband.<//review>

<review>I had a reservation and it seems that it didn't help at all. When I got there I had to make a line with all the people that didn't have a reservation by the time they realized that they should have checked if the people that had made reservations were there they had given mine and another gentleman's vehicle away. I had to take a van instead of the 10 feet vehicle I had reserved, I had to make more trips and end up paying more. I would say that they should have 2 lines or maybe an espcific area where the people that have made a reservation can go to instead of waiting in line only to find out that their reservation is gone because it was given to the people in front of them. Oh and why are we not allowed to return the vehicles to a different uhaul, why do we have to go back to the same location and returned the van there, that was 15 more miles that I had to pay for. I end up spending more money than what I had plan to spend, since I had to make several trips with the van.<//review>< Name>

Fast professional service. It seems they've modernized so returning rentals is quick & Easy. Renting takes some time tho id say about 20mins max if you came prepared. You can also return the trucks after hours :D<//Review>

<Text>I went to go get a trailer. The guy checked my truck and said I needed the connection for the lights. I said ok they charged me for the connection and installation. I took the trailer then returned it the next day. I was driving back home and a homeless guy told me I had a wire hanging I checked under my truck and cable was torn and the connection was hanging. Not only did the connection messed up but the guy did a horrible job installing it.<//Text><GmapID>0x80c2b7f9b157adcf:0xc326653fa49bfd49<//GmapID>< Time>

This is a heated cycling studio... I always snag a bike near the door, so whenever the door opens, I get a wisp of cool air.     We started late due to an unfortunate circumstance next door got ran into by a car just 30min prior, and I was new and needed adjustment.   Irina gave us still the full workout time plus some.   Another plus, they provide free towels and shoe rental!!!!    Free towels, free shoe rental, free water just bring your own bottle because you will need that refill!   Amazing!!!   Believe me, you will need that towel, you will need those shoes, and you will need that water!  Parking is easy, ample and free!  I don't feel claustrophobic in the parking lot or in class.  I love Irina's ENTHUSIASM when she teaches, it pumps you up!  Daniel... you kill me every time.   He does all these things that require your core.    I HAVE NO CORE... I have no balance, so even though the bike is stationary, I'm scared for myself.   But, I have gotten better, maybe even a little stronger I might add.  So yeah, I totally recommend this place!   I love this humble mom and pop studio, no pretentiousness here, just come as you are and get your workout on.< /Review>

The class was everything I was expecting and more. Stephanie was fun and engaging throughout the ride. I came to sweat and I got exactly what I came for. Also the pricing for the class was perfect. So tired of fitness studios gouging it’s consumers for money. This studios pricing is set where I’m not stuck with credit card bills to stay in the best shape of my life. Thanks so much!< /review>

Finergy Cycle I am always in trans each time I leave your studio, it makes me crave for more!  The owner, Irina is so welcoming and very warm that you instantly feel at home and comfortable unlike other studios which is so snobby and pretentious. She’s also one of the greatest instructors in the studio (been in the industry for years) together with my two other favorites Stephanie and Jillie, ladies; I swear you are all AMAZING!!! Those continuous sweat session leaves me on a high!!! Nice riding with you again tonight!!!  To those of you peeps who want to try out this studio, I guarantee you’ll love it here!!! It’s easy to find, lots of parking spaces and most of all it is affordable in the pocket!!!  It is so worth it!!!< /Review>

<Review>I love Finergy Cycle - a boutique spin experience - Irena and her team like Kimberley are amazing teachers - so dedicated. I have been spinning for years and they make you work your butt off! The music is great as well. I will keep coming back. I highly recommend trying them out - I bet you'll stay!</Review>< Pictures>

Tonight was my first cycling class and I loved it. I've been to many different types of classes n haven't sweat as much as I did in this class. Can't wait to go again.</review>

First time ever doing a spin class and I must say, this  has to be one of the toughest workouts I’ve ever done, but I loved it! I’m definitely coming back!</review>

<text>I took my first ever cycling class with Dana and had the best workout. While the class was challenging, she was energetic and encouraging. I would highly recommend this studio!!!<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c29e8f9b844a6f:0x47d78b7b3cceb42f</gmapID></record>

Class Pass taught me….

The Price: First class is $10 for new customers then $17 per class after.

Location: Super cute and cozy area in a strip mall. The setup is a bit odd in that you walk in to the check in desk and must travel through the cycling arena to get to the lockers and bathroom. The locker area is spacious and bright which contrasts with the dark cycling arena. But all in all there’s plenty of room and never felt things were overcrowded. Plus there’s plenty of parking which is a major plus.

The Workout: My bike’s console was broken so I wasn’t able to keep up with the different gears but I tried my best to adjust and still had a great workout. The instructor had great energy and kept everyone motivated. The room was a bit warm but great for those who love to sweat. The back of the room gets hotter so if you are afraid of overheating then make your way closer to the front.  But above all else, the music was SUPER good! The workout featured a great mix of hip hop and some pop, but mostly Beyoncé.

But overall Finergy Cycle provides a great workout at a reasonable price. The class wasn’t overcrowded and customer service was on point. Also they don’t charge for a spin shoe rental which is a major plus. Online they do mention a towel rental fee but they didn’t charge my boyfriend so it may be fine not to bring one. But you will sweat so keep that in mind and make sure to bring plenty of water.< /review>

Very unhappy with the quality of work done here.  Each time,  they kept my trailer 5 days to a week. And had to bring back, and leave with them 3 separate times.  1rst time to service my reefer... the next 2 times,  was to redo the service, that they didn't do correctly the 1rst time.
Actually had to take it to ANOTHER carrier  service,  to finally fix it right ✅< /Review>

Worse experience ever. Came there knowing that I have battery problem ask them to double check, also replace green light on the side of my unit because it was not working. Got battery replaced 2 hours later with invoice or $613 included (biggest rip off ever)...
Week later reefer start shutting off and by itself,  went to another Carrier dealer in WY and find out that plug to micro control unit is broken another invoice for $1550.
Thank you so much Carrier Transicold of Fontana for replacing my battery for $2163!!!! You guys are awesome< /review>

A nice place to go inside or have a little home style food outside in front of a nice lagoon. The deck is ameuture and the outback is oriented in disarray. More adolescents was enjoying this clubhouse.</text>

Visited this place during FleetWeekSF. Where they unloaded several armed forces vehicles from the boat. There is seating area outside. Inside is kind of old, but nice. This is very close to Pier 50. You can enjoy the view of the bay<//Text>

<Text>Was so fortunate to know a member who got us in. This isn't your stereotypical yacht club. They have a pier that you can tie up to fir a few hours but they don't have slips. Bruce our bartender was awesome. He had a great storyr about getting snakes out of Iran in the 70's. Even though we were guests all the members that were there were super friendly and welcoming. I hope I hey invited to go back again.  A great place to spend the day or night having great conversations and a great view<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7fda312cb649:0x31e9fe965de45464<//Gmap_id></record>

It's always sunny and I can easily rest with no traffic and let the kids have lunch while running the dogs. It is probably not safe to be there after dusk due to seclusion of area but it has a lot of new housing that will be affecting this shoreline soon, I'm sure....last great hiding spots of San francisco</review>< Response>

I love this little dive yacht club.  Local crowd, reasonable prices, zero pretentiousness.  Parking right out front.  And a darn good time all around.< /text>

A San Francisco Gem. Old School people with a desire to keep the club afloat. Sailing classes for kids and numerous events and parties. Right on the water walking distance from AT&T.< /review>

A great neighborhood spot - the fellows working are always very pleasant. Can’t go wrong with the forestiere pizza and they have fun special pizzas. Give it a try, shout out for their organic ingredients and sustainable packaging.< /Review>

Quality pizza with great ingredients and at a price you can’t find anywhere else in the Bay Area. We ordered the BBQ Chicken (uses Mary’s Chicken), the Meat Lover’s Pizza and the meatball. All of them were delicious!!

The shells are 10” in size which makes for a perfect portion. Also to note is that we ordered via DoorDash and the pizzas delivered very fresh (20 min drive from Apizza).

Definitely would recommend to anyone! Really great concept!< /text>

Had the mouthwatering Forestiere for $6.75! (not including tax and tip).

Still, can't beat a price like that for quality ingredients. Crust is crisp and is just enough pizza for one, or even two people 😄

Coming back to try their other pizza options.

The French owner is friendly; it's worth getting to know more about their menu items and what goes in it!<//text>

apizza has a very friendly staff. The frozen yogurt’s very good, and they’ve got a dozen unique flavors to choose from. Refreshments and food are good.<//Review>

Salads for $3.75 are also a great value. Take to go and parking during Covid is usually okay on Fillmore.< /Review>< pictures>

Average super thin crust pizza. Ordered the margarita advertised as $3.95 — ended up being more towards $5 for some reason. Had barely any basil or tomato. Paled (both in crust and stature) in comparison to other quality pizzas< /review>

Reheating: Do not reheat in microwave! You must do cast-iron/pan in oven at 350 -- it is extremely good reheated this way.

Margherita with goat cheese is where it's at. It's only $4. Depending on your size, 1-1.5 of them will fill you up; an extremely cheap lunch. I asked them why its so cheap and they said "why not?". Overall I do not recommend the "garlic bread" pizza; it is way too thin for what I would want in garlic bread, and they don't cut their garlic cloves. They should cut the cloves in thirds for optimal performance. Margherita and meat lovers were both phenomenal and extremely affordable. Looking forward to try more.< /text>

A pizza is as it’s, just a pizza for everyone. It’s affordable, it’s quick, it’s tasty, it really is delicious. The pie style is thin, with a proper load of ingredients on top. One pie is easily enough to fill up one person and splitting two is a good way to experience a little diversity.

We ordered the Margarita and the BBQ chicken pizza. The 9inch pie is a great bang for your buck, it was delicious. The chicken was extremely well marinated, the cheese was perfectly melted, what more could you really ask for at a price point like this? The crust is organic; definitely a unique find for San Francisco.

A Margarita pizza will run you 3$ and a BBQ, will set you back 7$. This place is a must go for pizza lovers in SF. At a price point like this, how could you resist?< /text>

<Text>Very yummy pizza at a fair pricepoint. As close to the real italian thing as you will get across the big pond. We tried the peperoni pizza and the margerita - love that their is actual mozzarella on the margerita. We liked the outdoor seating area and the friendly waiters. Will be back.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Experience is quick, takes under 30 minutes, prices are unbelievably cheap, lunch could cost 3 or 4 dollars if you need it to.  The food is good but not the best as it is so cheap.  If you have extra money, they also have very good ice cream and cookies.  Overall fantastic place to get lunch for cheap, laconic, and pretty good food.</review>

Great message about the pizzas. Prices are hard to beat with for the margarita and lots of other pizza choices. The baked crust had some not fully cooked area in the center. Overall, a solid quick lunch spot in Fillmore.</review>

<userid>117436723965531008023<//userid><text>My daughter goes to school in San Francisco and works on Filmore Street. Food is pricey is SF and Filmore Street area is a pretty well to do area with very expensive stores and restaurants. Life is also not easy right now with this virus, so I worry about her. This morning she called me to tell me about this pizza place she went to after work and paid  $3.09 for a delicious personal pizza. She was so surprised and thankful. She said the pizza was so good and the people so nice and giving such personal service. She said another customer was also so surprised and in disbelief with the value they were getting that she told my daughter "Can you believe this?"
Anyway, I had to write this review as a happy and future customer and to help this great business.<//text><username>Lilliam Washburn</username><Date>1584287717216</Date><pics>None<//pics>< rate>

First of all, I stood outside for a few minutes I'm disbelief. No way is a margarita pizza in SF only $2.75. But I'm this case, believe the hype. Not only was the pizza cheap, but also really tasty. The staff is helpful and friendly. I'll be hitting this place up a lot 😁</text>

apizza is a fast casual pizza spot with personal thin crust pizza (think cracker thin or flatbread thin). The space is huge and they have seating downstairs as well as upstairs. The pizza was very good, and I'm glad they provide the usual red pepper flakes, garlic powder, black pepper and oregano flakes to garnish your pie. Service is great! And water is offered free if you ask them for it at the counter when you order and pay. Owner and employees are French!<//Text>

This pizza is delicious, the people who work here are really nice, and the Margherita pizza is $2.75 (for a 9" pie). That's hard to beat.

They also have pepperoni, sausage, and a bunch of other meat option choices on the menu. I'd highly recommend it for a satisfying and delicious pizza meal.<//review>

The pizzas are rather small but mighty; they’re 9inches in diameter, and after 1 I was almost full. We ordered 1.5 pizzas per person and it was a bit too much. Next time one pizza & a dessert would be the perfect combination. We will be back for sure. Next weekend?< /text>< pics>

<text>A decent and cheap but extremely extremely hot pizza with a great message and culture. But it really doesn’t have any WOW factor other than a gentrified pizza joint in an already gentrified neighborhood. There’s more culture in a tub of yogurt. It’s no different than any other wanna be hot spot and in three years it will be gone.<//text><Rating>2< /Rating>< pics>

<Text>Great pizza with a surprisingly low price point. Ice cream is a perfect amount and the flavor choices are unique enough to satisfy anyone, but familiar enough to provide some great dessert comfort after your larger than expected 9" pizza.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80858141ad36e829:0x8008f01048df9d41<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

Pizza is great and the price is amazing. In a city where $7 juice and $12 toast are commonplace, a $2.75 pizza is completely unbelievable.</text>

In San Francisco, I pay over a thousand dollars a month to sleep in somebody's living room. I guess I can't complain though, because apizza has $2.75 personal margherita pizzas! In a city where everything costs an arm and a leg (and some other body parts), this place has the NERVE to sell affordable pizzas made with organic dough and organic sauce and some of the fastest, friendliest service I've ever experienced. They also have three kinds of oil "spritz", and for some reason, a recording of a cackling baby in the bathroom. Is the pizza here the best I've ever had? Not even close. Is this place weird, cheap, and tasty enough for me to write a paragraph long caption about and strongly recommend? Absolutely.</text>

It's all about the value here.  For $2.75--yes $2.75!--I had a fine Margherita pizza that was very tasty and fresh out of the oven.  Granted it's not quite up to Delifina around the corner, but for 1/5 the price it is seriously worth eating!  The staff is super nice and almost all French folks with their charming accents.  They offer the requisite shakers of oregano, hot pepper and Parmesan, plus real knives and forks for civilized eating.  Ironically, my Diet Coke costs almost exactly as much as my pizza!  (They gotta make some profit somewhere.) But this concept is a winner.</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very welcome, warm and smiling with good explanations on all the products offered. Quality monitoring during our meal. A very attractive price / quality ratio, in addition it is served quickly! The fact that the pizzas are smaller makes it possible to take several different ones. We had a great breakfast for less than $ 20 (3 pizzas + drinks) all inclusive for 2 people.

Food was wonderful. Unfortunately, they didn't have any Calamari prepped for us to order.  Can't remember what I ordered but here are the photos</review>

Ordered Ube cake for my daughters birthday and was surprised at the low quality of this cake. The icing tasted like lard mixed with purple color and someone forgot to add sugar to sweeten it. Then the cake inside is very dry... It is what they call the "arm" size ,and it cost $14.99 .... There was definitely plenty of icing because it tastes like it was made of lard. No wonder they suggested that the cake should be refrigerated because if you do no refrigerate it, the icing would melt. So very disappointed. They "used" to have good cakes. Not this time. Probably just going back to Sam's Club bakery to order cake for special occasion which is what I should've done.</Text>

<text>One of the only places you can find sinigang locally. I love all the food here and they are so friendly. Be sure to try some the desserts in the bakery they are Super Fresh and moist. My favorite dishes were the lumpia, chicken adobo, sinigang and Ube cake. The prices are pretty reasonable and the restaurant has a cute design and is very clean.< /text>< Pictures>

Service at the restaurant was slow. Only one server was serving all 7-8 occupied tables when we were there. Their food was good though. However, the packed pastries and other goodies taste old. Hope they didn't just change the expiration date sticker to sell old and unsold goodies.</Text>

Excellent place to go and taste popular dishes from the Philippines. I recommend to taste their "Halo-Halo" dessert. Expect to wait  a little to get served; they need to improve their customer service.< /Text>

Great food, but service is slow. Even on a not so busy day, it took them a while to get us seated. We always order pancit canton, grilled boneless bangus with mango salad, pork sinigang & pinakbet wth lechon kawali topping. The sinigang soup is a bit too sour, had to add a little water in it to dilute the sourness, and the pinakbet although it tastes good, is just a bit too greasy. Overall, we still love their food.</review>

<text>Please give a "LIKE" to the review.

I am highly disappointed.
Now, I was just there. So this is very recent.
My intention was to buy one of their famous baked goods --a mango cake.
Being the person I am, I called ahead yesterday to be sure they would have some in stock, as I also did the same by calling today. And both days the phone was answered by what sounded like teenagers --a female yesterday, and a male today.

In each instance, I was dealing with someone who was not knowledgeable about the simple topic of the mango cake I was asking about.
The latest one had to transfer me to someone who --from her lack of words-- was not informed as to what I wanted to know.
When asked what the cake had, like icing and all, I had to be placed on hold for them to be able to later tell me it was made of a vanilla cake, mango filling, and mango on top.

Now, upon arrival today, and in asking for the mango cake, the young lady at the counter had mistakenly heard that I wanted some kind of mango shake.
I know, I know...you are thinking, "They sound the same." But their product is not called a "shake"!
Once it was made clear with my slow, precise and careful enunciation of "cake," I was immediately charged and offered to join some rewards group via their counter top tablet. I declined to join.
Then the young lady asked, "Would you like anything written on it?"
"Sure. Yes," I thought with excitement for my Mother to see something written on her long desired birthday mango cake from Goldilocks.
The cashier could not find something for me to write on.
Pressed for time, and lacking my already exhausted patience with them (Goldilocks), I told her, "Forget it."
Cashier, having taken my signed receipt, and given me my copy, goes to the cake with out any hesitation or thought to stop at the sink she was passing to wash her hands.
*slaps forehead*
Not wanting to disappoint my Mother by not bringing a cake, I bit my tongue... which if I had been doing from the intial communication with Goldilocks, I would have bitten it off!!

Last point:
The cake was a dissappointment. $27.95 for a cake that lacked the flavor, texture, and fruit that I had recalled it had many years before. What the heck!?!?

Seriously, Reader... The reviewer is kind and considerate when approaching a review of an establishment --see my other reviews. This is my worst review ever, and the first.
I lack the interest in directing anyone, or suggesting to them to go to this business.

Goldilocks has really lost its appeal to me. Sad, too, because I remember their mango cake being so delicious.
A sad and disaapointing day.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Make sure you examine the baked goods carefully because some of them are past shelf life and they neglect to restock them with fresh ones. The Chocolate Roll I bought had mold on it. They are actually open at 9:30 am instead of 8am contrary to what it states in Google search. When you call ahead to pick up food, most of the time when you get there, the food is not ready. What's the use of calling ahead then? Despite all that,  the food is great especially the Crispy Dinuguan and their spaghetti. I just hope they step up their customer service and have fresher baked goods.< /text>

Ate there with friends and very disappointed with quality and prices. The halo halo had mostly gelatin and cost about $4 each. Lumpiang shanghai was nothing but crunchy shell with almost nothing on it.</Text>

Sister Bear & Brother Bear had a disagreement

Brother Bear decided to rebrand existing Goldilocks restaurants as Leelin Bakery & Cafes.

Sister Bear later branched out & opened up new Goldilocks restaurants in Cerritos, West Covina & National City.

Rodney Bear is happy to have Goldilocks back & still in my hood!

Goldilocks is like the Filipino Porto's.  Various baked goods are available for purchase.
Hopia
Siopao (warm & refrigerated)
Ensaymada
Cakes
My favorite, bread!

On a cold Saturday, we were famished & needed a hot meal.  A sign said "Wait to be seated", but I spied many open tables to eat, so after waiting for a minute or two, I decided we should seat ourselves.  A quick glance at the menu led to our lunch choices-

Mami siomai
Hot soup with egg noodles, celery, green onions, carrots, hardboiled egg & 3 pork siomai.  Soup for the soul.  I was a little disappointed that only 3 siomai were in the soup, but they were delicious.  The egg noodles were long & chewy, the broth soothing & comforting.  An OK dish

Lechon kawali
Crispy pork goodness!  I enjoyed how there weren't too many hard bits of fatty pork, like most turo turo restaurants have.  The meat was tender & the fat sweet,  Dipped in lechon sauce, and it's a beautiful thing!  But, who's kidding who?  It's all about that crunchy skin, baby!  Just be careful biting down on it.  Those w/o strong chompers may chip a tooth, know what I'm sayin?

Dishes are a la carte & do not come with rice.  Also, there are currently no lunch specials to be had.  All the Goldilocks favorites are here, such as bagoong fried rice, calamari & their sizzling sisig.

Service was okay.  It seems the staff is still oiling out all the kinks.  The wait wasn't horrible, but not quick, either.  Plenty of table seating on the left side of the restaurant, the right being dedicated to the bakery goods.  Parking is at the Seafood City shopping plaza, which can get quite busy during the weekend.

Like bumping into an old friend, Goldilocks is back & just the same as I remembered.  I'm fortunate to have had a Goldilocks nearby all my life, from the location that was previously located on Pioneer Blvd, to it's strategic move to South & Gridley.  This Goldilocks has prime real estate in a plaza catering to the Filipino community, with Seafood City, Valerio's, Jollibee & Eriel's Café as neighbors.  Come by for a authentic Filipino meal, then pick up some bread or other baked goods to take home.

Rodney Bear highly recommends!

Good food > bad service
I ordered Paksiw na lechon for to go > I got home opened the container and I got Lechon Kawali
My mom went and ordered 2 Fresh vegetable lumpia > she went home and got Lumpiang Shanghai instead
Today I ordered 2 fresh vegetable lumpia for my mom , got home and they only gave me 1 for $14.00
So before heading out make sure you got what you ordered for to go...< /Review>

Los Angeles County Process Servers Dept. was very efficient: same day results!
During this pandemic they were able to meet me and explain the process. Being new to this whole summoning thing they were able to deliver the papers within 1 hour and quickly sent me a text message when it was complete and an email with the proof of summons. Everyone there was extremely helpful from the first call to the server and customer service. They made this so easy and simple and above all that they were also very affordable. I appreciate the service and thank you once more. Will highly recommend them to friends and family.< /Text>

I work at a law firm in Oregon, and I contacted Janell with a service request on an individual in California.  She served the individual quickly and I had her proof of service within a matter of days.  I believe I would have had the proof of service even quicker had I not given her the service job two days before Christmas.   I would highly recommend her services.  She is professional, reliable, and very easy to work with.</Text>

If there was a way I could rate this company at 1MILLION... I WOULD DO IT IN A HEART BEAT!!!!!
I desperately needed a process server in Los Angeles to serve a company in which had been trying to evict my elderly DECEASED grandmother for many many month, this company REDWOOD HOLDINGS, LLC. Had been claiming to be another company at their Los Angeles location and PURPOSELY TURNED ALL THEIR CREDENTIAL INFORMATION UPSIDE DOWN!!  MY SERVER WENT COMPLETEY out of his way to get the proof that this company I needed to have served WAS IN-FACT REDWOOD HOLDONGS, LLC. He Verified the company's credentials for the exact address I gave him and he then "Politely EDUCATED" the individual at that address of what would happen should they continue to be shady as heck!! Same day service (2 HOURS!! PER MY REQUEST FOR ONLY $130.00!?!?!?!)
THIS company is the ABSOLUTE VERY Best IN ALL OF LOS ANGELE'S!!!
YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!< /Review>

<text>Atlanta Process Servers has been a true blessing for me. Mrs. Vanwestbrook was very helpful, and informative. She made sure that all of my questions were answered before I made the decision to use services. I will definitely be telling my friends and family who may need process services in Los Angeles. Even though I live in Southern California I didn't not have to wait everything was done in a timely matter. I even received my final paperwork before my actual court date. Thank again for you services< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c711fdc0f38b:0xc6b8f722cf4f85cb</Gmap_id><userid>114166222399996025007< /userid>< Name>

<Text>I was in need of another Process Server because the Sheriff's went out to serve the defendants 5 times and was evaded. Cars were in drive way on all dates visited by the Sheriff's.  I called LACPS and Spoke to Richard. He assured me that I was connecting  with a reputable business. He gave me their Business License # and I called to check them out. All was good so I met up with Dink. Dink looked a little scary with his Gas Mask on (lol). He showed me his ID and I was sold. I gave him a money order for services and made it out to LACPS. He served my papers and I was so happy to get my copies and he filed the copies with the Court. There service gave me a feeling of relief and lessened my anxiety. I went to my court Date and one Defendant showed up and he represented the other Defendant since the businesses were comingled. I won my case and the defendant had to pay my Court Cost and pay me for my Process Service Cost and the remainder of my Security Deposit. If he doesn't pay I will definitely use LACPS again to serve the defendants with future Court Documents. Thanks LACPS for excellent service.<//Text>< pictures>

I called LACPSD and was put in touch with Dink. He showed up introduced himself and showed proper identification.  They were able to locate the person and serve players within 24 hours. I was kept abreast every step of the way. I highly recommend this company.< /Review>

After many attempts to get defendant served, they advised to do a skip trace which i should’ve done in the beginning. Turns out they were right from the beginning to take that route, used them again for the second wave of serving and first time was the charm.  Great service and great feedback. They always provide invoice and proof. Will use them again in the future.</review>

My office had been trying to serve a party for several months, with no success as he seemed to be very good at avoiding service.  LACPSD was able to find the party, successfully personally serve him, and provide a video and photo of the person served, all for a very reasonable price.  Andrew was very responsive and great to work with.  If I ever need to serve someone in Los Angeles again, Andrew is my first call.<//Text>

<Review>The process servers at Los Angeles County Process Servers are responsive and that is what I think most people need when they are involved with the District Court Civil Case System. When I told them that I am poor and all the way out of the city in the hills they offered to do good works and come out to the hills to get the documents I wanted served on the weekend! The process servers know the ins and outs of process serving and how difficult and dangerous it can be for people who try to do it themselves. The process servers updated me regularly in text, telephone, and email writing on the progress of the service and notified me as soon as service was complete. The process servers were helpful and even smiled at someone like me (poor) at all of the exact right times ensuring me that everything would be served and filed correctly with the Clerk of Court as soon as possible. The process servers were able to serve the Agents for Service in my civil case the very next day and service would have been completed the same day but the office for the Agents of Service closed at two. The Proof of Service was emailed to me for my records and the process servers also filed the original Proof of Service, copies, and a stamped envelope with my mailing address with the Clerk of Court for filing. I may have to file another District Court Case in about sixty days and if I do then I will definitely ask Los Angeles County Process Servers to accept me as their client again.</Review>< pics>

Customer service is just excellent. Sent them the papers. Debbie was very nice. As soon as I sent the papers they emailed stating the papers were printed and we're going out. So I waited, they emailed me a few hours later they said it was served. I don't write reviews but I wanted to stop by and give a thumbs up.<//Review>

<Text>I highly recommend LACPSD.  Extremely professional and prompt service.  They have successfully served hundreds of defendants for my firm.  They always get the job done.  They know the rules of procedure and are available to discuss which serving methods are appropriate. Their prices are reasonable and they even offer last minute rush services.< /Text>< Name>

I contacted lacpsd all the way from Jacksonville, Florida to request service of process of a Complaint for Partition of Real Property to the IRS in Washington, DC, in regards to one of our cases at our firm. The set-up was super easy! I emailed the document directly to them yesterday for service and received confirmation of service today! HIGHLY advise anyone looking for an out of state process server, in their area, to use their services. I will be a repeat customer, FOR SURE!!  Thank you!

I had the pleasure of working with lacpsd during the COVID-19 pandemic as I needed documents authenticated/apostilled for a work visa in China. When other companies were unresponsive and shut down, I found lacpsd to have extremely quick replies to all my questions and had excellent service along the way. I was very confused at the start of the process by what I needed and lacpsd was able to help answer all my questions and outlined everything with very clear, detailed bullet points about what I needed for apostille. They accepted everything possible through digital means, and I only had to send one physical set of copies in (which the embassy required). With the embassies shut down, lacpsd stayed in touch with regular updates about what was going on with the local requirements and when I could expect to receive my documents. Ultimately, my job has been put on hold and I do not need a visa, and lacpsd very quickly responded with as much of a refund as possible. I hope to still be able to work internationally in the future and will absolutely go to lacpsd again when I need my documents prepared for that visa. It has been a pleasure to work with this company and would encourage anyone who needs documents apostilled to use lacpsd! Thank you, personally, to Christine for all your help during this time!</Review>

The service they provide is TOP OF THE LINE. They will research and will not give up until the job is done. I am so impressed by the attention to detail that goes above and beyond what any other company we contacted and paid did for us. For this kind of service I would have expected to pay more than the average but they actually are more affordable! Also customer service is outstanding, if you get the pleasure of speaking with Ruth you know you are in good hands!</text>

<Name>Genoveva Rangel<//Name><time>1583200430254< /time><rating>5< /rating><Review>Bob and his team are exemplary. Our firm first started using them a little over a year ago and would never consider using anyone else. Best deal in town, and so reliable that we are never concerned when a statute of limitations is close to running. We are a criminal law firm.  We recently hired Bob and his team to have a subpoena served to a witness who was evading service.  Bob and his team had the witness served within 24 hours and the his price undercut all of his competitors.  We would highly recommend using LACPSD Services if you are ever in need of a process server!!!

All the other ones just seemed to take my money and run. Nickel diming me to death and other things like that. I called up Bob Van Westbrook who assured me that he will be able to get my papers served for my divorce proceeding. The family law matters that these people serve are very very good very speedy and it didn't really take much time before I was able to get my proof of service. Even though the guy was on an army base they was still able to serve without any problems. I wish I had chosen first because I had tried to get a friend to do it then I'll try the sheriff's of course that didn't work it's literally forever for the me to look at the paperwork. So I'm glad I was able to give them a shot. Call Bob Westbrook if you need any thing served. I'm sure get get it done for you.

<Text>No problems whatsoever using them again for the third time. It's nice to find a reputable company online for serving papers. I had used them in the past and will always recommend their services. They are one in a million. Have got me out of a couple of last minute restraining orders on two people at once with only one day to serve them . As always Bob was helping me get the job done with one of his special female process servers. They always go above and beyond what's necessary to ensure proper service.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I'm an attorney in St Louis Missouri and I had a couple of claims that I need to serve on a company out there. After locating this company I was very pleased with the way ball presented himself very professional. It was for a couple of car accidents has that had happened on the street. They were able to serve it timely and effectively and even got it notarized for only $25. I had called some other process servers in the area and they just simply weren't even worth my time of day to consider. If you do have some papers you need sir this is the best company in LA county very professional and a one.</text>

I would never hesitate to recommended LACPSD. How do I know they are so good? They started me on the journey of my Legal Support Services career of 23 years and made it possible for me to own my own company for the last 19 years. I owe everything to Bob and Barbara and do not consider them my competition but rather they are integral affiliates and I am honored to call them my friends.<//Text>

Then I was able to upload my information online . After, trying to get the defendant served after 3 attempts by the sheriff department, LACPSD pserver was able to find the defendant on the first attempt in a discreet matter. I received confirmation via email the next day with the appropriate court paperwork attached. They even mailed the proof of serving directly to the court.

<Review>For my small claims it was simple. I heard that this department is very professional and timely in everything they do from serving to filing my proof of service at the courthouse. I remember them from years ago and have been in Los Angeles for a long time so I had to give them a call. I'm very glad I did. After speaking with one of their reps it was very easy for me to start. Just emailed them and paid by credit card .Simple fast and efficient.< /Review></record>

I was extremely pleased with the restraining order service received by Bob. The chair is can get it done because it was too hard to serve the guy. After about a week of you trying to use this Earth they simply failed to deliver properly. I was forced to have it a private process server located Bob online who had a pretty good website and the requirements for sending the documents to them was pretty simple. I just use their online form for restraining order. After about three days I got word back that the document have been served. I've been submitted my payment no problem. Very trustworthy company I would recommend.<//Review>

<text>Atlanta process server was professional and knowledgeable and I was very happy with the service I received. The process was very easy. It started with an online request. Then I was able to upload my information online . After, trying to get the defendant served after 3 attempts by the sheriff department, LACPSD pserver was able to find the defendant on the first attempt in a discreet matter. I received confirmation via email the next day with the appropriate court paperwork attached. They even mailed the proof of serving directly to the court. I would definitely use this service again if necessary..</text>< Pics>

Thanks guys for a job well executed. I had an initial consultation and they actually told me I did not need an investigator I needed an attorney, which I hired. We then spoke again as I was grateful for their honesty and ended up hiring them for some work to finish up my divorce and child support payment and they found the truth which we was able to use in court.</review>

<text>LACPSD Process Servers has been a true blessing for me. Ms. Margrette was very helpful, and informative. She made sure that all of my questions were answered before I made the decision to use services. I will definitely be telling my friends and family who may need process services in California. Even though I live in Southern California I didn't not have to wait everything was done in a timely matter. I even received my final paperwork before my actual court date.

If you need any legal services including family law and unlawful detainers this is where you need to go!

Barbara is amazing and I have been giving her for my business for 4 years. I will continue to as well because she really builds a trust between the client that is unmatched.

Usually, most legal services can be very scary and unclear. Barbara really makes sure to specify and recommend what he thinks is best for you and I trust him 100%!

She offers so many different legal services as well and can do it remotely! LACPSD is by far the best there is.< /Review>

For a local process server in Los Angeles simply the best company. It was just a simple phone call for me to get the process started. I sent them an email of my papers and after 24 hours it had been conpleted without constant follow up. Los Angeles should be very glad to have such a reliable process serving firm that won't break your pockets and is extremely fast and reliable . I definitely will refer them to all my friends whenever a process server needs to serve my papers.< /text>

<text>I'm an attorney in San Diego and I often have a summons and complaints that I need to be served in the Los Angeles area I usually use this department. All it takes is a simple email and from their website I can gather more information as to how to get my document served on a rush basis. Bob is very informative and I would definitely recommend using them to serve your documents if you got them. They can even provide video of the serve so that no one can say that they weren't served.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I was very pleased with the service. I ordered the service and Sophia was a great help throughout the whole entire process. I had to call the other process server I had hired more than 10 times before I finally gave up. After calling Sophia I felt confident that the service would be completed. And after giving them my 10 small claims, sure enough it was served only within a matter of days. Sophia was totally what the doctor ordered. I will definitely use them again.<//Text>

<text>I needed a restraining order search for someone that was seriously harassing me a try to use the sheriff's but it didn't work because the court date was too close. I only had a day to serve in and this guy pops in and out on a daily basis so it's kind of hard to determine when he's home. I called up this company and spoke to Bob then Westbrook was very informative tell me about the little process. He even did it in the Stream dark it was 12: 00 midnight when he got it served if he was still out there serving papers on me just going way above and beyond the Call of Duty it wasn't for Bob there's no way my papers when he gets served I even got a video service and he posted it on YouTube thank you very much Bob for your effort.< /text>< gmap_id>

I need a restraining order served on a guy that kept popping in and out he was really harassing me and I only had five days to serve it I was up to extreme deadline. I looked online and I was disappointed with a few of the other companies authorized they just didn't seem to be professional enough. I contacted this department and spoke with Bob Bob has very nice he informed me that he was able to serve the documents within the body of day and that restraining orders are served on an emergency basis. So I went ahead and email them the documents give them a try and to my surprise they are exactly right it was done within less than 24 hours. And I was able to get my proof filed at the court< /Text>

They always go above the call of duty. This time they served for me after 12 midnight. I just had to take the time out to write such a positive review for a company that always provides me with superior customer service and satisfaction. I received my proof of service by email and they filed the original for me at my courthouse. I cant say enough about how professional and a time saver this company is. i will always refer them to as many people as I can possible refer.<//Review>

I needed some papers served in the LA area and I was having a difficulty locating a good reputable company. I found this company online and they seem to be very professional and everything that a person needs in order to get the job done. So I give him a call. After 3 days my documents were served despite difficulties in locating the defendants are able to not only locate them serve them and follow my proof very reputable company I would really recommend them to all other attorneys and individuals who need documents served on a need basis.</text>

<Review>What a great service. I had to put together 10 subpoenas to doctors offices for UCLA and needed them all served within 2 days. I called up the department to get it done. I was shocked that all 10 witnesses were found professionally and timely by this department .I can't tell you how relieved I was .Ultimately all witnesses showed up for the hearing and it went very smoothly. I had used another fake company and was extremely dissapointed .that's not to say for this department.

< review>
I was looking for a process server to serve a few small claims documents for me I had more than 5 so I really didn't want to pay $100 per person as other companies charge. And all of the other companies a little bit unreliable they don't return calls for a cause or don't pick up. I made one call to this company and they picked up on the first ring I was very pleased about that. And after a couple of minutes of conversation with Bob informed me that my documents will be served the same day. The only fee  they charge was a $50 fee and a print fee at $0. 30 per page which is okay by me. I emailed the documents over to them I got an email notification about 3 days later that my documents have been served which was very pleasing to me as well as affordable for my pockets. I will definitely use them again if I do need a process server to serve any of my law suits.</review>

Very pleased with the service of this firm. My documents were served and I had received confirmation the next day concerning getting my papers served. I would definitely be using this firm again. If you need a process server in the Los Angeles area definitely I would not hesitate in calling up Richard McMillan and Yvette. They are a big help.<//review>

<text>I had relocated to another city after living in LA for 20 years.  After my relocation, I filed a lawsuit against someone who defaulted on a promissory note.  I found Bob and LACPSD online.  Once I called, I felt like they were the servers for me.  I went to the office, met Bob in person and he answered all of my questions and was honest about the serving process.  Each case is different and he did not sugarcoat nor make any promises although he did say he loved his job and he felt confident about serving the party in my case.  Bob was accessible and responsive via email and kept me informed about progress.  I shared as much information with him as I could and he stayed in touch with me throughout the case.  Bob went the extra mile to get the plaintiff served in Texas and sent me a confirmation email six days before stating that the plaintiff had been served.
I would recommend Bob  and LACPSD if you ever need to have someone sserved. Bob is your guy!
Thank you, Bob!</text>< pictures>

After filing my restraining order  against another coworker I was in need of another process server to serve my claims against the respondent. I called up this company known in Los Angeles for professionalism and speedy service to serve my claims. After speaking with a rep they told me no problem. Email the papers over or we can pick up your papers free of charge. Since they are local and really in Los Angeles unlike all the other imposters who just say they are, very speedy and addorsale as well.</Text>

Excellent process serving company. We are process servers ourselves across state and we needed a document served really quick as this was the last day to do it. So after contacting this company I spoke with Richard who was a great help for our company. Thank you Richard if I could give you 100 stars I would indeed.< /review>

If I could give 10 stars, I would. I highly recommend the services of Bob Vanwestbrook and his staff and team at LACPSD find great comfort in knowing that whatever the task or case/fact specific details involved may be, I never have to worry about making sure LACPSD ill remain focused on the job requested; and will execute with the utmost professionalism and diligence. Most importantly they keep me informed throughout the entirety of the process; and are able to report back with a detailed account of the pertinent information necessary for me to determine whether I need to take additional measures for my clients. LACPSD Provides me with the gift of seemingly creating additional time. The ability to assign a job and then turn my attention to other matters without losing any confidence in knowing that LACPSD is serving and protecting my client's best interests is an invaluable aspect of their services.

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>This is really a great service for serving papers. I was pretty satisfied with the service on overall customer service. I had a small claims document  needed to serve. The service was in Holmby Hills @ was extremely far from the normal population. Besides being behind a large gate it was extremely difficult even to contact the owner or the person that I was trying to serve. I contacted Richard and I asked him if no one comes to the door how will the document served? He said that within 10 years no one's never not come to the door he can always get somebody to come to the door. I said wow a little bit and laughed because I found it quite amazing that he can get someone to come to the door all the time. It's ok so i decided to give him my documents I emailed them to them. After about a week I did get confirmation that the documents had that served. He said that he just stayed at the door and just kept knocking knocking for about 3 minutes 3 minutes straight till somebody came out.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

So, you're here looking through these reviews because you have a job you need done and it's most likely not for a pleasant reason with a pleasant person. LOL.

Whatever reason you're looking for a process server, the person or agency you hire should take the stress and nerves out of the situation, and that's exactly what LACPAD did. They nailed the defendant in my case within two days like a total pro (three total attempts at two locations).

Hiring them was the best decision I've made in a long time. Save yourself some trouble and worry and go with LACPSD. You won't regret it.<//text>

I needed a some documents served ASAP two 3-day notices on 2 peeps  which is usually a pretty easy service I didn't have to search around too long before I ran into Bob. I usually call a server and it takes them forever to stick with the process. This process of service company seem to do it lickety split in a matter of hours for no additional charge. She was only fifty bucks and there was a $25 fee which I really didn't mind thanks cuz I really needed it done ASAP because of the fact tenants are refusing to pay their rent. I will definitely be using them to serve the summons and complaint eviction process of the service.</text>

<user_id>105667729934413569111</user_id><text>I was looking for a local process server to serve my family law papers because I had hired another process server only to he dissapointed in the entire process. The other company I think it was ABC Legal did a horrible communications job and I was very displeased. I called up this department and spoke to Bob who informed me that the papers of a family law matter are very time critical and need to be served as soon as they can. Soni emailed them to Bob and before noon time I had received an email confirmation that the service was already done. I'll be using them again Everytime I need them.< /text><time>1579831039098<//time>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I really need to process server company and was really tired of looking around and all these bogus companies out there and promise you good things and then don't deliver. As I'm certain I noticed that the Los Angeles County process servers department is number one in a lot of different areas. So I decided to give him a call and use their services for my unlawful detainer. After calling and speaking with Bob he seemed to be a pretty nice guy I forwarded him my documents by email. After I forwarded to them by email I received a confirmation email back which indicated and describe the kind of services that I will be receiving. I submitted my credit card information and lo and behold with in about 2 hours the documents were already served. They said they served it at the rush fee for no additional charge which was a great surprise to me sing it as how other companies try to rip your pockets open for miscellaneous charges. If you need an unlawful detainer served I recommend using this company because they provide free steak outs and are sure to catch whoever is in that unit. It's a good idea to give Bob a call and you can tell him that I sent you thank you.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>I was living with a horrible lousy person and I needed him evicted like yesterday. Tried the sheriff's didn't work, tried a pi didn't work. That was of course untill I called up Bob. You know both. Knows his stuff and anytime I need papers serv d at the last minute, it never fails Bob comes through . I mean this guy must have a radar and can tell when someone is home. Gets there quick and gets me that proof I need. All of Los Angeles I definitely recommend this guy especially he is close, can pick up the papers and in most cases can have it served within a few hours!!<//text>< pictures>

I previously had bad experience with other companies but I was really overwhelmed on how fast and professionally they serve my paperwork no one was able to serve the papers I needed to be serve and also they were courteous Professionally and wasn’t that expensive I will definitely use them again and will refer them to friends and family 😊
I’m so happy that after two years of attempting to get this papers serve in a few days they got serve this is legit 👍</review>

It was really tough especially I was all the way in Maine. After calling them up, they assured me that they could get it done within a matter of only an hour. And it works. Thanks for getting me out of a tough situation.< /text>< Pics>

The unlawful detainer action included a few defendants and I knew that all of them will be running from the process server. After searching around I located this professional firm to Los Angeles County Department of process server. Very professional Bob was very good explained everything to me to the letter. Told me that even if the defendants did run that his process servers were very very good and well trained and we be able to serve them within about a moment's notice. after only a day I received notification that all three tenants have been served the lawful detainer action. This evening a lot of attorneys fees and a lot of times I would definitely recommend this firm for serving your unlawful detainer actions or any other lawsuits and we'll definitely be returning again.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1611869952272, 'text': 'Thank you for using our service.

I had used this company before to serve my unlawful detainer action and I was pleased with the service so I called back up and spoke to Bob. Bob told me that I'd I were to email over the detainer that they could get the first attempt in in about an hour. After emailing the papers to Bob, he made it very easy to complete the process and get me the proof I needed to get them out. Very professional company.<//Review>

I used this company to get my papers served through an unlawful detainer action. Since this was the first time I have ever had to serve one of my tenants since they are always on time with the rent, this is something I just didn't want to do. I was very curious as to how the whole process would go. After speaking with Sophia and Bob, they let me know on a conference call that getting the papers served on them tenants was as easy as a simple email of the unlawful detainer and that they serve all unlawful detainers the same day for no additional fees. They even explained the process I would have to do to finalize the unlawful detainer process service with the sheriffs. If not for them, it probably would of been a real nightmare.< /Text>

<Review>The food was great! Probably one of the best boneless wings I’ve had however, I was a little disappointed with the service. Granted, I went on Wednesday after 6pm and they happened to have boneless wings on a sale but, if this is a weekly thing then the staff should know what to expect. The waitress kept telling us she’ll be right with us, we waited almost 25 minutes to place our drink order. I get it, they were busy or maybe even short staffed but, almost 25 minutes to place a drink order after being seated is a long time. We placed our drink and food order at the same time, beer came within 10 minutes and our food quickly after. What I didn’t like was the customer service. Not once after being served our food were we asked how was everything. Once our waitress saw that we were finished eating, she came over and asked if we wanted a box for the left over tots and then after we said no, she went and grabbed the bill and brought it to us. My bf has more then half of his pitcher of beer left and I had about 1/3 of my beer left, I planed on ordering another beer. We went to dirty birds with the intension to eat wings, drink beers and watch the game. We felt rushed, as if they needed the table. At this point we decided to go to another sports bar and bought beers there.<//Review><user_id>116188117899394013012< /user_id>< Pictures>

We love coming here because of how well we are treated and how delicious the food is! Danielle is the host usually for us and the past few times, she’s always smiling and always willing to help us. We’ve had Grace a couples times and now we just had Ariel as a server and hands downs the best service we’ve ever had at a restaurant. We will always recommend dirty birds and come back!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

There are lots of great flavors to choose from, and the wings are juicy and delicious. The tater tots are also a must try!<//text>< pictures>

It was good! Great service and cool atmosphere. Got the boneless and they were a little tough, but the sauces were tasty. Tots are VERY crispy and Mac balls are delicious.</Text>

Fantastic wings!! * Always enjoy the atmosphere here for everyone is always friendly * TVs everywhere if you're into sports * Pet friendly (patio) * Huge selection of flavors * Great selection of beer * What else could you want when having wings 🤷🏽‍♂️. As always, I hope this helps you newcomers. Enjoy!!<//Text>

Great experience, delicious wings and loaded tots. Wings were well cooked and meaty, unlike other places that have small wings for the same price. The Dirty Chicken tots are a large appetizer to share with more than 2 people. Hidden gem with delicious food.< /review>

<time>1555178982545< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>This place was awesome. I was visting town and my buddy suggested going and I didn't regret it. We ended up going during happy hour on accident and it was perfect because bone in wings are half off during happy hour. The draft beers were a dollar off and pitchers were half off. The wings were very saucy with a great flavor, especially for the price. I got the Maple chipotle BBQ, which weren't as spicy as expected. The mango ale I got was also good. There are tons of TVs inside and a nice patio seating area if you wanted to sit outside. There's plenty of room if you are looking to bring a large group of people. Overall good food and great vibe.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Lemon pepper, Habanero wings are the best. Plus the $12 champagne!
Ghost pepper wings are definitely spicy but it has no other flavor which was a bit disappointing. Spicy garlic wings are not spicy but really garlicky!<//Text>< UserId.>

Some of the best wings you’ll ever have. Great beer selection. We were really surprised they charged us 50 cents for extra ranch dressing while the eight of us were dropping $100 on food and beverages. Ice tea was pretty weak. Service was good.< /Review>

I called in an order in at 1:00 PM. It took us 20 minutes to drive over. At pick up, we waited 10 minutes but our order still wasn't ready. Finally get our food and ticket said the guy didn't put the order in until 1:30. Travis forgot to put the order in when I called, instead of apologizing he gave us excuses and was rude to my mother in law.

I know this place can do better. Food is great, service was disappointing.< /Text>

< Review>
I use to come in here on Mondays a lot for unlimited chicken wings. They got really big Chicken wings and the service is fast about it. They got good specials with the beer as well. Chicken wings and beer is not the only thing great they. They got good burgers as well, but Monday are just really special for some Chicken wings. I still try to come by here even though a live farther now<//Review>

<Text>Delicious and relaxing lunch in a beautiful winter day out in the patio.

Service was a bit slow for things like drink refills but didn’t matter that much since we were not in much of a hurry.

Loved the dirty version of their wings which has the ranch dressing mixed into the sauce.< /Text><date>1582637461875</date>< rating>

Great sports bar with even better chicken wings!

We stopped here on a Thursday night to eat wings and watch football. The menu of wing flavors is extensive and covers everything from mild to extreme heat. I opted for the Green Machine flavor (medium heat and combination of cilantro, guacamole, Serrano, and jalapeño) and also the El Diablo (hot heat, blend of 3 spices). They were both fantastic!

I also ordered the chicken blue cheese tater tots which were very good. Perhaps a side of hot sauce with these would have helped.

The beer selection was great, and our server was super friendly and attentive. There are TV's everywhere so you always had a view regardless of where you sit. We were sat at a long table shared with some others, but still had plenty of space to relax.

I'd definitely come back!< /Text>

Called in an order because of COVID-19 and the lady that took our order, Turbo, was so rude when I asked about flavor options. Once I went to pick up the order, she ended up getting it wrong and then scolded me about how it was my fault. Awful service and rude employees.<//Text>

Dirty Birds in general is one of the best options when craving wings in San Diego.   Living in Pacific Beach, I recently have been going to the Liberty Station location because it is a little easier to get seated but still also gets crowded.  Monday's are all you can eat wings for a flat rate.  But I prefer Tuesday evenings where they do 1/2 off orders.   I have never been let down on the wings or their sauces.  They are mega tasty and service is always fast.   The Liberty Station beer selection is good also.<//review>

Horrible service. We waited almost and hour and a half for our food. We did have a party of 20, but there was also another group almost as big who got their food before we did and we ordered first! When we finally got our food, they were bringing pieces at a time. It took about 20 min for everyone to get our food. Then when we finally got our food, it was cold. About 4 wings into my food, I found a piece of hair in it. That was the icing on the cake. The only thing good was the fries which ended up being my entire lunch. We will never eat there again!<//Review>

Great choice for quick late night drinks & eats. We sat at the bar with quick friendly service. Very tasty chicken wings 1/2 Dirty Blue & 1/2 Apple Bourbon Chipotle ... finger lickin' good with side of generous tots. Goes great with an Irish Ale,  Strong  Bow Cidre, & Ace Pineapple Cidre. Lots of TVs, easy parking & coming back to hang in patio.</text>

<review>Good wing places come in 2 varieties: they cook the wings excellently or they have amazing sauce.

Dirty birds is the latter. The wings themselves were quality - as in freshness and size - but personally I prefer a fried to order wing. These were clearly baked beforehand amd then flash fried to order. Huge benefit to this is time though. My order of wings was out I  about 10 minutes despite it being a packed Friday night.

The sauces, though! A large selection of great sauces. About 40. I tried 3 and all were excellent. Particularly the honey mustard and habanero. Great roasted hab flavor without the heat being over-powering which is a very difficult line to walk on.

I would come back any time I'm in SD.<//review><Rating>5<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x80deab031fe40001:0xea41598717ead4ea< /Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Y’all, this place basically turned my husband and I down...my husband went in and asked for a table for 2 out side with our dog. The girl told my husband that she was not seating outside. He then looked and seen at least 4 other couples outside. So he asked again and she said we could sit at the bar but she was not seating outside tables because of the rain...the radar doesn’t show rain but okay. We were just there last night and had a GREAT time with Kayla as our server but tonight was totally different. I’m very disappointed.<//Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Extremely upset with service and management.

I arrived at 5:50pm and was promptly seated outdoors. Waitresses came and checked on several tables near ours but never even made eye contact with us. At 6:04pm a waitress finally acknowledged us and brought water.

I asked if the restaurant would honor the Happy Hour specials (that end at 6pm) because we had been there well before that. The waitress immediately became defensive and stated that she was very busy (there were many empty tables and no wait to be seated). I stated that we would leave if the deals were not honored. She asked us to wait while she spoke with her manager. When she returned she said that she would only honor half of the happy hour special. We decided to leave at that point.

I don't understand what the point of offering just half of the deals was. We were not trying to negotiate or barter for food. We just wanted prompt and courteous service.

We ended up going to Slater's 50/50 a few blocks away.

I cannot recommend this establishmenI. Maybe their other locations are better.<//review>< Pics>

Delicious wings but terribly overpriced. $18 for 10 wings. The chickens must have had college degrees to justify such high prices.</Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>This review is a 1 star mainly specifically due to staffing and speediness of food delivered.

The food quality (wings are fantastic) but the staff is sour, unresponsive, and food times for a basket of fries as an appetizer and wings took 30 minutes. Restaurant was 40% full at time of ordering. very disappointing.

Super lame and very disappointing. If you’re coming off 9 holes at Loma Club, skip Dirty Birds. Only come in if you’ve got a couple hours to eat your meal and are down to be ignored.</Text><date>1564352439181<//date>< pictures>

Good food, not great for large groups. Went in with a very large group and it took about an hour for everyone to be able to place the order orders for food and drinks. Other than our party, it was relatively empty.

The servers were polite and friendly and I'll definitely give this place another shot, however I won't be taking a large group there again.<//Text>

Service in the beginning had me really worried it was gonna be a bad experience. After our waiter got to us it was amazing! The menu is fun and has flavors you don't get everywhere, I've have found a new love old Bay on wings sounds crazy but I can't go without it now. Beer menu is small but stacked with quality beer! Prices are fair and the place and restrooms are very clean.< /text>

Really good wings. Every type from dry rub to spicy to sweet and peculiar. Service is good and cocktail/beer list is good. Lots of Tvs, indoor/outdoor seating, dogs allowed on the patio. Make sure to check the specials. They have pizza at this location too (they don't in PB).</Text>

<text>We took a group of almost 30 people for a graduation party and the service did not miss a beat.  Their thin crust pizza was great and their variety of chicken wings was great.  We were able to get happy hour pricing on some of our offerings.  All in all a great etmosphere.< /text><userid>108112427519908083626< /userid><rate>5<//rate>< gmap_id>

Great food, cold beer and a parking lot. This is only not five stars because I think the Pacific Beach location is better for wings. I love spicy and think the habenero wings are some of the best in town! The teriyaki are also very good if you don't want spicy but still love wings! Dog friendly patio area is great!<//Review>

All craft beers are $7 or more. When I was there the wings came out cold so we had to send them back. Once theythey came back they were of course delicious. Not a horrible place but I have had better experiences at the Pacific Beach location.</Text>< Pictures>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>While our server was good and friendly the cheese sticks were undercooked, the marinera was bland. The wings were cooked properly but I didn't like the flavor of the lemon pepper or the jerk seasoning. The worst tasting thing was surprisingly the water. They really need a filter. The hazy IPA was good.<//review>< Name>

<Review>My visit wasn't the best, the restaurant was half full but we waited as if they were extremely busy. It took 15 mins to get our order taken and more than 20 for the food. The server wasn't very helpful either. It was a bad experience and I wouldn't want to go back to this location

The food though was pretty good, wings are always good. The beer selection is great.< /Review><time>1541799237477</time>< user_id>

<text>Brat wings in SD.  My personal favorite combo is habanero lime with fireball.

Wife loves buffalo and maple chipotle bbq.

Soak in the sun, drink a cold beer and enjoy some food and conservation.  Great afternoon.

An upgrade to Marie's ranch and blue cheese would be showstoppers.< /text>< pictures>

The wings were delicious,but the service was poor . We have tried both dirty bird locations in San Diego and each time the waitress took our order, brought our wings , but never came back for the reorder( it was all you can eat wings). We waited 35 minutes and we finally had to track someone day and it still took an additional 10 mins for a different waitress to come. What made it worse was we saw our waitress taking several orders around our table, but she ignored us. Maybe she was offended by my son with Autism. I will not be eating at either location again.<//Text>

Unfortunately I have to put at least 1 star. It's a long wait for anything, the wait staff ignored our table. The name of the place suits it perfectly the inside is dirty and has a very bad smell.  The health department should shut this dump down.<//Review>

My favorite place for chicken wings!  We especially like coming here on sunny days when we bring our pup and sit outside.  The staff are friendly, the drinks and beers are good, and the prices are reasonable!  What more could you ask for?</review>

1. Driest wings I’ve ever had.
2. Super stingy with the sauce
3. Place is way to over hyped..
4. SUPER OVERPRICED wings.
5. Sauces all tasted basically the same
6. mild,hot, & extra hot all tasted MILD.
7. Customer service wasn’t great at the bar
8. Obnoxious regulars.

Wasn’t even worth taking Snapchat</review>

Food is good. Best wings I've found in San Diego. Terrible service. Stood at the door for 10mins waiting to have my name put on the list then waited another 15mins to be seated.  After watching them seat a couple who got there 15mins after me ahead of my party of two. College area location is much better< /Review>

<Text>Lots of flavors, but we tried four and they were all pretty bland. The spiciness ratings are all off. The two hot flavors were mild, but the mild flavor was actually hotter, almost a medium.

<review>I have wanted to love this place. I have wanted this to be our new goto place in Liberty Station. But after 3 attempts, this place has failed on many levels. To say that the service was slow is an understatement, and we sat at the bar every time. It took over 10 minutes each for just a hello. If the place was jamming busy, that would be one thing, but it wasn't. 10 minutes for a Hi, 10 minutes to order beers and then 5 minutes to get the beers is just too much. Then the music was so loud (in the middle of the day) that we could not hold a conversation. Everyone around us was complaining about the music being too loud too. We asked the bartender to lower the volume so that the person 3 feet away could hear me. After 10 more minutes, the volume was lowered and the people at the bar cheered. This lasted for about a minute before it turned right back up to where is was. 4 people at the bar then left, they couldn't take it any more. We again were very determined to like this place and stayed. The service continued to be slow and we could not have a conversation.

The other experiences were no better. The service is lacking behind the bar, I really wish that it wasn't. I want to love you guys, but just can't.</review>< pictures>

Anyone who complains about these wings are absolutely out of their mind and way too finicky. Every wing flavor I’ve tried there has been meaty and nothing short of delicious.</Text>

< Review>
Rude bartenders, saving seats for buddies when we asked if seats were taken and were told they weren't and another guy got up and gave us his seat. Bartender comes over and tells us to get up because there are people waiting for those seats when the people weren't even close to the seats. By the way the hostess told us the bar was open seating. Horrible service, first and last time here. Would rather go spend my money somewhere else.<//Review>

<review>I ordered several pounds of boneless wings for a work event. The sauces weren't very flavorful, and were sparsely used. The wings had the texture of something between a nugget and jerky. This was my second try for this place, and might be my last.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I love wings and this place is not where I want to get them. I got a water with lemon, mozzarella cheese sticks,  honey mustard and bbq bone in wings...the honey mustard tasted like mayonnaise. The wings in general tasted plain. Waitress wasnt too inviting. The location isnt ideal either. I get it, liberty station. High traffic area, 2 bases arent that far away. But there is also the airport. Airplanes cut off every conversation as they fly overhead.< /Review>

<Text>Ok food but nothing to write home about. Mediocre service. FLIES EVERYWHERE. I understand flies are a part of life, but there were so many that I felt like I was eating inside a dumpster. I would only go back if a friend invited me out and even then I would ask them if they're sure that's where they want to  go.<//Text>< pics>

Came in on a Wednesday night, had terribly slow service. Took almost an hour to get our wings. They tasted fine, we just would have preferred if they let us know the kitchen was backed up.< /Text>

Omg the chimi cheesecake was delicious. I like how there's several TVs visible no matter where you sit. Lively atmosphere and it looks like it could get very packed during a big game.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>
