<review>This place is great! The dancers are beautiful, although I wish some had more energy. I did get a private dance from Lacey (I really hope I'm remembering that right!) and I would absolutely recommend her! She was so nice and beautiful, a wonderful choice for my first solo dance! The club itself is really nice and clean and all the staff was great. My husband and I will definitely be back!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I had a great time here. Enjoyed watching a few dances on stage and then went in the back for multiple lap dances. The girls were very hot. I’ll definitely come back sometime.< /Text>

I told the dancer to continue dancing facing me I don’t think she heard me because of the loud music so she turned around and her butt was close to my face the next morning I had pink eye luckily I got health insurance a week before so it all worked out good</text>

<user_name>Denj Gaz<//user_name><Text>Hullo All,

It was my very first time at any strip club and I have to say that I'm really glad I got to spend it here!  The men at front were cool and helpful.  The location and bathroom were clean and well lit.  I accidentally threw away my receipt but the barmaid still gave me a water bottle — props to her too!  There were many Cheetahs who came up and asked me how I was doing and felt welcomed to be there..!  Thank you Mandy, Nikki, Penelope, & McLovin' for being very courteous and professional.

I must specially mention that I had an absolutely amazing first (and second) lap dance from the ever beautiful Scorpio!!  I really, really hope that I get to see her and enjoy her lovely company once again in the future.

Many thanks to you Cheetahs,
Cancer.<//Text>< date>

<Text>Good afternoon fellow gentleman. It was a normal Wednesday night with me and the brethren. We decided that we would go to a gentleman’s club and usually I would go to pacers, but due to my outstanding balance we had a different location in mind..... cheetahs. The women were lovely, the scenery was elegant, and the complimentary water was to die for. The night was a hoot and I couldn’t have asked for a better one. Making memories and slamming water like there was no tomorrow. After one of my private lap dances I noticed that there was a huge wet spot on my jeans. Can anyone guess what color it was? Red! I’m assuming the girl who gave me a private dance had a ketchup packet in her g string or something and it exploded on my jeans! Do better cheetahs.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>Had a great night! $20 cover for a lot of fun. Loads and loads of girls all looking to dance and chat. The space is clean, and appropriately lit. The girls are polite when you decline a dance and just want to hang at the rack. The girls make sure you get attention, too. Dancers are very athletic and can really work the pole! Great customer service and great dancers. I'll definitely be coming back to Cheetas again!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Went there for the first time the other day with a group of friends and I gotta say, it was a lot of fun! I had 3 dances that night and each seemed to be even better than the last. The majority of girls would come up and actually talk to you for a while, and I appreciate that because it makes you feel more like a person instead of just a walking wallet. Yes, some of the girls were kind of pushy and up-front about going for a dance, asking directly right off the bat, but they were all respectful when turned down.

The place was clean, staff was nice, most of the girls were beautiful, and everyone wants to make your night enjoyable, which is appreciated. $20 for a single dance is a little steep since the songs are cut a little short, but I didn’t mind because the girls I got dances from made sure to make it worth-while. I appreciated the girls that would come and actually talk to you for a while, and the last girl I got a dance for didn’t even ask me if I wanted one, we sat there and talked for a little while and I actually asked her if I could get one and I definitely don’t regret it.

Overall, I’m very satisfied with my experience there and I’ll definitely be coming back again in the future.

And my suggestion to people saying they had bad experiences from girls that weren’t that good: instead of just jumping into a dance with someone right away, try to pick the girls that pique your interest and actually talks to you, those seem to be the ones that make it much more worth it!< /Text>

I went here on a Thursdays around 1pm. The place was excellent. There was a good variety of girls of all types. I got a lot of attention by the girls asking for dances. The girls were personable and talked to you before hand. The club is more of a basic dance club. It's more of private shows. The prices were fair. 20 dollars per dance so each real dance cost 100 dollars. It lasted a long time. The girls webt abiab and beyong. I would definitely return.< /text>

First tried Goldfingers and there were only four (average) girls who would flinch every time the manager walked by  Then went to Cheetahs' where there were about 30+ girls.  Some very hot.  They all seemed happy to be there.  I had much fun.< /review>

First time in a strip club. They really aren’t my thing but I was in San Diego for work and my co worker wanted to pop in to “pop my cherry” so to speak. The cover was reasonable and the girls were beautiful. I declined several offers for a dance and every girl respected that grace. Holly convinced me to accept a dance eventually and that was definitely a different experience. She made the whole situation worth while.

The bullpen is also next door which is a great place to grab some drinks and watch sports. They offered stamp my hand so if I wanted to grab a beer or a small bite to eat i didnt have to pay to get back in.

All in all it was a great place to kill an hour or so of our time after work.</text>

Good club. Clean establishment, variety of beautiful women. They weren't pushy for dances. Doorman greeted me friendly and so did the bartender.  So as far as the reviews go, I don't know what some of them are talking about rudeness.  Tv's all over the place for game days. Will recommend to friends that visit the area.<//text>

No alcohol?? After that, the chicks beg for a dollar and I just walked in. I'd rather check out a strip joint in Mexico where I heard it's better. Please tell your D squad smelling of "daddy issues" and the others who need to workout, seriously that if you're cute you will be tipped. If you're not cute, this is the wrong profession by far<//review>

<text>Worst time I've ever had at a strip club, and I've been to one where the girls were fully clothed. The DJ sucked really bad, all he did was play mellow as hell music, he only played half of each song too. The place was dead, like it was full of people,But it was so dead no one looked like they were having a good time. The girls were beautiful, but they overcharged for dances. Never again will I go back and would not recommend<//text>< Name>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>It was my first time at a strip club in general, I went with my best friend and we both regretted it. First we paid $350 to go to some ice box room or something like that and the girl I had was so drunk the dance wasn't even enjoyable to me I hated it, infact she barely even danced she mostly sat on top of me laughing with her friend. The only good dance I got from there was from a girl named Holly which is why this place is getting two stars cause of just her alone. I definitely will not be coming back here though it was a waste of my money< /Text>< Pictures>

On the night that I went they had a TON of girls. It is one of the nicest clubs I've been to in terms of quality of women. The staff was friendly. The club was a fun party as opposed to being too stuffy or too uppity. Highly recommend this club.< /text>

Didn't like how one girl only ask or even offered a dance . they rest would be so stuck up and keep walking . they treat couples like if they have nothing to offer . it was retarded how my husband had to move a seat over to have a girl walk over to him . next time this won't be a place to get lap dances from . but the front staff and waitress was amazing.  I give them props</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>In response to helitek YELP review ,Yea, the club was advertising their buisness  with a banner over the beach what’s wrong with that  ???  How can someone give one star when they didn’t even come inside the place ? Adult entertainment is not illegal and  , kids gotta grow up one day . Because truth be told , when kids turn 18.  The first thing they want to do is go to a strip club for their 18th b day.  Because it’s all they can do ...everything else is 21 and up. People need to grow up ! In this day and age society has changed , sex before marriage , divorce rates are higher then before and your children end up at strip clubs. Me and my husband had a blast at cheetahs . Lots of hot women great place for single men or married men that want some great eye candy. Club looks great after the remodel ! Shoutout to the owner and the women that work hard and keep that place running ! Will be back !<//review>< pics>

Great club. We were happily picked up by the shuttle bus and had a great time. Nobody wanted to drive and this solved the problem.</Text>

<review>The door guys r cool. There is one cool barmaid, the really long blonde haired barmaid has an opinion of herself that is unjustified.. Most of the dancers r stuck up.. A couple hot ones but nothing special.. They sure r fair with there deals tho.. $10 for 2 drinks and entry is well fair.. Overall the venue staff r cool except the long blonde and the cost is ok.. If u want to meet nice girls go to the body shop.. A little less pretty but a lot less attitude.. And just remember, there r some cute girls at cheetahs but a lot that think they r way better than they really r.. It's amazing what heels, make up and the dark can do.. The club is nice, clean and there r plenty of parking spots.. There is a bar next door as well</review>< user_name>

<Review>These dancers may be pretty but they are clearly lacking customer service or public relation skills. Basically, if your looking for a prostitute youve come to the right place... each dancer has a price..if you want to see them after club closes. Similiar to a brothel but this place is where you go to pick your hooker.
Lacking class! Girls lack high education and communication skills. The employees minus the dancers were accomadating, helpful  and courteous though.< /Review>< pics>

Very very cool too. I mean dancers are nice but she made you think it was genuine whether it was or not who lnows but anyway.You will go in there thinking you will only spend a couple dollars and she will have you digging into your savings.

Ive been to MANY strip clubs in San Francisco,Portland OR and TX and this one sucks. You walk in yes it is packed but theres a center stage girls dance at but dont seem to be into it at all. Seating makes you feel more awkward than you normally would. If you go to get a dance in the back area girls dont even take off any clothes now why would I do that?I understand the california law with no full nudity and serving alcohol and Ive read other people saying why would I do that. Uhhh they dont have a choice. But no one is trying to serve any sodas or regular drinks to make people feel more comfortable. The girls there purely give out this feeling that they want to take your money with little entertainment . The 20 dollar cover charge at the front door is bullshit. I went to The Acropollis in Portland which is much better with a 10 dollar cover. I will be checking out other clubs in San Diego but this one is not to go to if you can avoid it< /Review>

My husband had contacted several companies to come and give us quotes on what it would cost to put insulation into our attic and in the walls of our house. All Seasons Insulation Co. was one of the companies we had contacted.
Mark Gianino came as the estimator for All Seasons. After speaking with him, we were so impressed with Mark’s honest and informative feedback; we could tell he was not trying to have us pay for things we didn’t need. We decided that day that we would have All Seasons do the insulation job, and we booked an appointment with him.
Mark called the day before to confirm our appointment, and he had also written his cell phone number on the estimate in case we needed to contact him.
The crew promptly arrived and throughout the day, various members explained what they were doing, always with the goal of keeping us safe. They worked both diligently and nonstop. They cleaned up after themselves every step of the way, and were very considerate on our property. I especially appreciated that they did not disturb my plants.
We would highly recommend All Seasons Insulation Co. to anyone looking to keep their home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest, I would rate them at least an 11. We were told it would take a day, and it took about 6 hours.< /Text>

< Review>
All seasons installed insulation for our walls (blown in). The staff were all kind, courteous, and knowledgeable. They worked efficiently, and left everything cleaner than they found it. Today, with 105° heat outside, the house is only 74°. It was also noticeably quieter in the house immediately after insulation, despite previously never having noticed there was noise. It's an incredible improvement. I can't speak to any of the other services they offer, but based on my experience I would highly recommend.< /Review>

I haven’t gotten the response I received from this team in years!  I put out a feeler looking for an attic insulation project.  They called within 10 minutes offering their services.  This was on a Friday, the estimator was there the following Monday / on time.  He checked everything over and presented numerous options.  Before he left I had a quote in hand, none of this “we will be in touch” garbage.  We agreed to the level of service we wanted and made an appointment.  They showed up on time and completed everything in the quoted time frame.  When they left you would have never know they were there.  Everything was as clean as before they started.  I wish they did more than insulation for sure!  You won’t be disappointed.  Awesome job!< /review>

I would like to share what an absolutely wonderful job this insulation company did for my home. I called a few companies to get estimates for installing insulation in my attic but was pleased when I met Mark, their estimator who was very knowledgeable and answered lots of my questions. To my relief the crew of Joel and Alberto were able to access my very narrow attic and spread the insulation out evenly throughout my attic. They even sprayed it into two, almost inaccessible, bedroom ceilings. The crew did a wonderful job based on photos and a video they provided after the work was performed. I liked that they arrived on time, lined all of my floors with their cloth tarps, vacuumed all areas they accessed and informed me how they were going to proceed with the job. Needless to say I am very pleased and satisfied with their work and with their very reasonable quote. I highly recommend them.</text>

I had All Seasons remove my insulation some time back then had them return to re-install. Very professional and did a great job. I will be having them do my exterior walls next. Great company and would recommend them to anyone looking to have thier insulation done!< /review>

All Seasons Insulation put new insulation in our attic. We IMMEDIATELY noticed a huge difference in our homes ability to stay cool. The men were prompt, polite and efficient. I’d definitely recommend them to anyone needing to replace the insulation in their home.< /review>

These guys are fantastic. Super professional. No pressure or hard sale . It really feels like they are more educating you so you can make the best choice for your house, instead of just trying to sell you on something . Joel is great ! He inspected the attic shot videos and took pictures so he could explain what was going on . Him and his crew were on time and didn’t take long at all . As for the product it’s amazing . Are insulation had depleted so much I could see down to the ceiling sheet rock In a lot of places with the pictures Joel showed me . After they insulated our  roof I noticed the house kept heat much better and longer durning the winter and fall . Recently it has gotten hotter . Was 90 degrees all day the other day and my house never went above 74 . I didn’t even have to turn on our ac, where as  before we would have had the ac running all day until it cooled at night . It’s even better then it was 11 years ago when we first moved in . Thank you so much guys . We are going solar soon and this well massively help and most likely have us over producing ! Oh and great pricing as well !< /text>

Attic insulation job in a very large 1892 Queen Anne Victorian. Joel and his team was very professional, on time, and did a great job. I am looking forward to warmer winters and cooler summers. Total cost seemed eminently reasonable. They were finished before I knew it. Great video at end, too.<//text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><user>103901513376065009266</user><Text>Mark G., who came to do the estimate (our 3rd) was very helpful and patient explaining and answering all my questions. It took 2 weeks to get an appointment but the day off, Joel and the large team were very curteous and worked clean and efficient. They did a great job (day 1) on the insulation removal and replacement. We also had the outside and some of the inside walls insulated (Day 2, indoor walls only for sound proofing, outside for insulating.old house built in 1950's) - and it does make some difference.
The only issue was that the holes they had to drill into the inside wall for filling with the same material are really hard to cover up with touch up paint, as what they use to fill them and touch over leaves a shiny mark when painted over - so on the smooth walls I basically had to do a full paint job on the wall which occurred unexpected cost and hassle whichnI didn't expect. The outside walls were not a problem (not smooth) and  I had touch up paint leftover that made it easy and simple to touch-up.
They are a great company and we were very satisfied. Definately would recommend them to anyone needing insulation.</Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< date>

All Season Insulation installed the Mountain Fiber Cellulose insulation in my attic.
Joel and crew showed up on time ready to work.
They were professional, courteous and friendly.
Joel addressed my concerns answering my question before starting work.
They completed the job faster than I thought without disturbing my sleeping granddaughter.
Also on completion Joel provided me with a before and after video. Nice touch.</review>

I hired All Seasons for blown-in insulation in my walls. They are courteous, respectful, and gave great customer service. I asked a lot of questions and they were happy to educate me. The first you will notice is that they will not gouge the price and will charge you lower than most competitors. My home now is more comfortable in the cold and I’m looking to hire them for installing insulation in my attic. You don’t need to go with the expensive quote when they can do the same work. I’m happy with the them and they did it at a good value!< /text>

We set a date, they called to confirm a day before, then arrived exactly when they promised. The work was done efficiently, with a minimum of disturbance to us, and in the manner Joel had verbalized and put in his proposal. We feel warmer already and can’t speak more positively of All Seasons Insulation’s professionalism! Highly recommended...if we could give 10 stars, we would!< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< name>

<review>As a general contractor I have used All Seasons Insulation a couple times but last month I used them on my personal home. I had them install wall insulation on a home built in the early 60s. They showed up on time, very professional, very courteous and clean. The work they did was done in a professional manner and we immediately noticed a difference in the heating and cooling of our home. Highly Recommend them to other general contractors and homeowners needing their services. We will be using them again on our next projects.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808561166f400001:0x9c6a5db3dc1cef8a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<username>Bailey Garbarino</username><Review>I have nothing but good things to say here! I previously knew nothing about insulation, but I knew I had an issue with running my air and heat constantly. My house wouldn’t hold the temperature and I was paying more money that I would’ve liked to on my energy bill.

I did some research on my own and finally decided to reach out to All Seasons Insulation. Mark, the owner, answered the phone and immediately was so helpful and friendly. He answered all of my questions and offered to send someone to look at my attic and walls the very next day! Joel, his son, came out and after checking around in the attic, showed me pictures of what was up there and explained the details of what we could do to the attic and walls and the kind of difference it would make in my home.

The next week, Joel and the crew came out and got to work! They were on time, even worked around my Zoom call where I had to be in my office space where they were going to be insulating the walls. They were so friendly and professional and CLEAN! I am a neat freak and honestly expected to have to do some clean up myself, but they were 100% on top of it. They wrapped it all up in a day and Joel showed me pictures of what my attic looks like now and said if I have any questions or concerns to reach out to him personally.

I’m so glad I got this done right in time for the cold season! I have already noticed a difference in how seldom my heater kicks on and I feel so much more comfortable. These guys did an incredible job from the very first phone call to the execution of their services. They were all friendly, professional, clean, and did a great job all the way through.

I would recommend ASI to anyone looking to make a difference in their home.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

I had a very great experience with the All Seasons
Insulation Company, from the estimator, Mark, to the two man crew, Amondo and Joel,  that installed the cellulose insulation, containing boric acid/polyborates!!  The Insulation process was explained to me in a direct fashion, and carried out very professionally.  Moreover, the estimate was very reasonable and affordable!!  I highly recommend All Seasons Insulation for your own Insulation problems.  Dr. R. H. Fish, Berkeley, CA< /Review>

All Seasons did an EXCELLENT job insulating my attic and walls.  A++ from start to finish: from Mark the estimator who first quoted the job, to Joel, who led the installation, (and his crew), it was a very positive, and professional experience overall-- especially given that I'm quite particular and detail-oriented. I never once felt pressured to "just decide" and as a result, their patience won them the job in the end.

I ask a LOT of questions (a L-O-T) before I approve any work or allow contractors into my home, because I want to ensure every detail is considered and addressed. I work very hard for my money and also want the best value possible. Therefore, I vet each contractor on a number of points: their approach to the job, their knowledge/experience, their reviews, etc. If you do your due diligence, as I did, you'll find that many insulation companies are over-charging and grow impatient when you ask questions.  They just want your signature on the dotted line so they can get paid. ASI was one of four companies I requested a bid from.  They had the BEST price and the BEST customer service. Remember, price isn't everything.  Customer Service is a vital consideration, because everyone is nice when things are going well, but the minute there's a problem, that's when you see a company's true character/business practices.  With ASI, I got it all!

As I posed question after question over several weeks, Mark and Joel were always patient and informative, never responding in any manner less than respectful, professional and timely. And on the day the work was performed, the crew was on time, ready to go. Any issues that arose were discussed calmly and solutions arrived at easily. At the end, they left my home cleanly swept and as they found it.

From what I understand, Joel is poised to "grow into the business" and eventually run it. If so, he's off to a GREAT start. He's friendly, easy-going, informative and (again) so very professional.  I highly recommend ASI.<//text>

<resp>None<//resp><pictures>None<//pictures><review>I'm really disappointed in this company's customer service. My first time ordering. For all 3 orders I placed I never received an email confirmation (didn't matter if I had an account or not). After emailing the company on the first order, they cancelled it and instructed me to place the order again. I did exactly that. Once again, no order confirmation. After weeks of wondering where my order was, I logged on to my account only to discover the order was cancelled. No cancellation notice from the company. Nothing. So, I placed a third order - same thing - no order confirmation, order cancelled, no cancellation notice. I emailed the company and asked what the heck is going on. Here is their reply "Thank you for contacting us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may be caused to you." What kind of resolution is that?! Thankfully, I found this same brand on Amazon cheaper and it will arrive in a few days.</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2caef3e27148f:0x500a9da6bfac5d7c<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The products are good quality and been using for 6 years. Now, when you decided to buy on their website, it's terrible. I had 2 bad experiences already and decided will never buy from them again. First they don't send the products you order, yet they charged you for them. Then the phone number they provided doesn't work at all, no one answers. I finally was able to contact them through Facebook, to received a response 2 days later, requesting me to send them screenshots to proved them that I'm saying the truth. It seems that at their office, dont have sales records, phones to communicate or they just dont know what they are doing. They reimbursed my money.  4 months later they sent me a product I didn't ordered and again the same story, I had to send screenshots of their emails and products and they had no idea. Even though it had the actual date, they keep saying it was an old one. Overall a HORRIBLE experience and a waste of my time. Its sad that great products like Art Naturals aren't supported by decent customer service.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2caef3e27148f:0x500a9da6bfac5d7c</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I placed an order on March 11th. To my delight I still have not received an order (April 22). I received a tracking number on march 30, again to my delight,  Ups hasn't received anything from ArtNaturals. I will be disputing the charges with the credit card company. I wouldn't recommend purchasing from this company. I also tried to reach out on Facebook and was ignored. They setup a bot so no kne can speak with an actual human.< /Review>

Horrible customer service as i was told to wait another 7-10 days for delivery even though they are less than 10 miles away.</Review><Date>1614733743202< /Date>< resp>

I just ordered hand sanitizer. ( 12 bottles) and there is the strangest smell.  It smells like paint.  Very strange smell and I have been trying to call this company to no avail. I purchased a few through Amazon before and it did not smell like this.  its so bad that I cant even put it on my hands.  The smell is horrible.< /text>

Buyer beware!
Today is 05/12/2020. We have not received our order that was place on 04/18/2020 pm Amazon. It showed that delivery would be made within a week or between April 24th and May 1st.  On May 3rd email showed item was shipped and upon tracking the package it says that it is lost in transit.  The system made us wait and now we have to wait another 2 days for a response?  This was charged to my credit card on 05/04/2020 and my email telling me that my package was lost was on 05/03/2020.

I tried calling and the telephone message is old.  No way to leave a message, only email. Their email response states that responses take up to 2 days.
Their website shows "IN STOCK" and shipping.  Our son just told me not to order from this company. He didn't know we had ordered the same thing on Amazon and he ordered it direct.  He had the same problem!  This is not an isolated case people! There is something really wrong here and I would wonder that if this is the way they operate.. lying  or misinforming the public about availability, maybe they product they are selling isn't what it claims to be either.  We have an eCommerce site and changing an item to "OUT OF STOCK" is not that hard, it takes less than a minute. You have plenty of time to blog...why not update your stock?
We are a business and made this purchase because we are manufacturing dispensing stations for commercial use and in the future, they may be one of our customers...or maybe not. We would never treat a customer in this way.
As I write this, the order that my son cancelled just arrived.  In researching the credit card transaction, it appears that his card was charged on 04/29/2020 and yet the shipping label shows it was created on 05/04/2020.  This means it took 8 days to get from one city to another within the same county?  I doubt it!   I could have walked there and back in less time.  The request to cancel the order was just ignored.
BTW this product is in smaller forms all around town.  I am a big advocate for small business and keeping things local.  But if you have an issue, be honest with the customer, they will understand. Especially during these trying times.  If you are so busy that you cannot keep up, hire some help.  There are plenty of people who need a job here in Los Angeles. Don't be greedy.
Update!  We tried this product and are seriously concerned about how it is manufactured.  The product smells really bad.  Like cheap tequila.  It made us all want to wash our hands after. If this is how it sanitizes, do yourself a favor and go buy a bottle of soap instead.</text>

<Text>Ordered a gallon of hand sanitizer. Took almost 3 1/2 weeks to receive. The product was unsealed and 2/3 full as if it’s been tampered with. I tried to get a refund due to it take extremely long and no contact from the business. I’ve contacted them again because how can I know the certainty of this product without a seal. This place is a rip please don’t waste your money or time.< /Text></record>

<text>I ordered scent free hand sanitizer and received a scented version which I couldn't use due to allergies. Company wasn't accepting phone calls or answering emails.  Then the emails were undeliverable.  Tried connecting on Twitter and Facebook for a refund. I made four requests for a refund that never happened. I then requested a company check and made it clear in an email that I was being victimized.  The next day the check was in the mail.  Company is a nightmare to deal with.  Stay away unless you enjoy stress.</text>< Pics>

Ordered hand sanitizer.  Two bottles arrived in a cardboard box with some bubble wrap.  The bottles were not sealed.   One opened/leaked, then partially dried, leaving a stick mess all over and an empty bottle.  The other bottle also was down about 2" from the top.   In addition to the loss of content, without a seal of any type, I have no way of knowing if the contents of the bottles is as packaged, or may have been tampered with.   I have tried to contact the company in 3 ways:   the live chat has been shut down,  as per the telephone greeting they are not accepting calls, emails bounce back as undeliverable.< /Review>

I have been buying their Shampoo and Conditioners for past three months. Great product however worst customer service!! Bought their hand sanitizer since they stated on the ArtNatural website it is in stock. They sent me the tracking number but the tracking number hasn't updated. I contacted the customer service and sent them email but no one has replied.</Review>

Total fraud, as everyone is reporting.  Charged my card and show its shipped, but UPS shows it never shipped.  Calling credit card company and looking into which district attorney's office to request a criminal complaint.  This is credit card fraud.  and I have the documentation to demonstrate it.< /Review>

<Review>Ordered gallons of gel hand sanitizer online. Still have an unfulfilled order out there from 2 months ago (for 6 gallons) that they never delivered. I ordered multiple times and received some gel hand sanitizers from them. Then they started sending me liquid hand sanitizers, which I absolutely did not need. They are very unresponsive over email or by phone.<//Review>< pictures>

I purchased a four-pack of hand sanitizer in  8oz. bottles alone with a gallon jug refill hand sanitizer.  The total price was almost $100.  I received only the four bottles and the gallon jug was not included in the delivery.  The tracking info says the package was delivered so I know it wasn't UPS's fault.  Nobody is manning the phones there and nobody is responding to the three emails I sent to this point.  I'm just trying to get my money back for the gallon portion of my order, but they are ignoring me.   This company is knee deep in price gouging and they have zero professionalism or accountability.  I understand this is a difficult time for everyone, but businesses should still maintain good customer service especially for essential products such as hand sanitizer.  I will never order from them again and I would advise others to avoid this company as well.< /text>

Do not order from these people. I processed an order through them on March 16 they took my money, they put a shipping label on my order so it looks like they shipped it but UPS says they don’t have it and it’s still sitting in Artbaturals warehouse. Their phones don’t work in the emails don’t work so you can’t get a hold of them. Their messages say they sent the product out by March 25 but UPS says they don’t have it.
They took my money. These people are frauds. Do not give then your business you will not get your product. They are scammers!!!! Order #300176984 I want my $49.24 back!!!!!</Review>

We purchased 1 gallon hand sanitizer from Artnaturals under the advertisement that it will ship in 48 hours.  This advertisement was what caused us to make the purchase.  We have never received our product, can't get anyone to answer the phone or call us back with a response.  We have tried to cancel and ask for a refund since they billed immediatley via email and are now having to dispute the charge with our credit card company.   false advertising and horrendous customer service.  Not even convinced this is a legitimate company at this point..</review>

Horrible service! They said they have shipped but it is nowhere! Tracking number shows UPS still hasn’t received the item, phones can’t be reached, emails bouncing back, no one listening. Please be transparent even if there are delays. Please avoid them at all costs! If you are artnatural, please contact me ASAP regarding my order.<//Review>

I'm reporting this company to the federal trade commission. I placed an order on Feb 19th and I have received no communication via phone call or email. This company needs to get their customer service together. If the owner is reading this then read this carefully...... use a little bit of that profit your making to invest in a few more workers! You use to be able to answer your phones, now your "too busy!" You say "email us".....but you don't email back. If you can't find the right staff to run this company then you sir are going to run this company in the ground. Look how many people you are making angry on your Facebook posts. Just search their company Facebook profile or search their name in your Facebook search bar and you will see in their sponsored ads how many people wait forever to get their products. Your customer service is horrible. You want that big boy money without paying for customer service reps. I was placing $5,000 orders with your company and your going to lose my future business. Your real busy right now, right? Keep operating the way your operating....You will not be busy for long. Your customers will guarantee you that!<//Review>

They claim to have product in stock and don't, they send you a tracking number that never works. If you attempt to contact them there is only a recorded message on there listed phone line, contact via email is useless!! Don't get scammed by this fraud company.

I ordered a box of sanitizers for our company but never received the order. I sent them an email 4 times but no responds. They never pick up the phone either. I am going to dispute the payment through our company's credit card. Terrible customer service!!!!</review>

Totally a SCAM - advertising products they don't have and can't obtain. Good luck getting a refund.</review>

Love their essential oils--quality and prices are excellent.  But trying to communicate with them via phone and email regarding a special purchase has been extremely frustrating.  Their customer service and responsiveness leave much to be desired, so I would stick with ordering online, i.e., cut-out the *human* factor.</review>

Sadly as of a little more then a week ago, Hard Hats Temecula is closed forever.

Got busted for something by a Undercover one too many times, what was the final violation, who knows. It had been so badly managed and under promoted for so long, your guess is as good as mine. I knew some Great Ladies that worked here at different times, but all smartly moved  on after a time.

Going to miss Hard Hats because of those people and the good times we shared here. Good times and good memories.<//review>

Worst bar I've ever been to. They don't have hard alcohol, one pool table doesn't work and the other is missing a cue ball. The waitresses "can't do anything" about the tables, or the fact that we wasted money on them.

Don't waste your time or money here.</review>

Overpriced beer, food of questionable quality, but let's face it, that's not why you stop here.</Review>

<user>101102752346411620720</user><Text>If you're going to buy snow chain, try AutoZone. These  $100 cheaply made snow chains worked, but not as well as we expected. They helped us to get up the hill to Tahoe. I wish I could return them. They got us to where we needed to go. It's BETTER to just invest in snow tires instead.
Anyways, the stores are always clean, the employees are always helpful. They do not always give the best advice though. Ask as many question you can think of if you are looking to buy a product you don't know much about. They'll be happy to answer.< /Text>< Rating>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I’ll admit,  I am a little tense and “jumpy” these days, but who isn’t? So today when I had a disagreement with a younger employee at this O’Reilly’s in Cameron Park started, I quickly recognized that this could easily get out of control, and I asked to speak with the supervisor.
In steps Joshua.  Manager.  And although I was expecting an argument, he quickly made it better.
He practiced old fashioned customer service.   The Pre-Walmart style.  And for Joshua, O’Reilly’s
Still has me for a customer.  Thank you for the old school customer service.  It was refreshing.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again.. Auto part stores are SUPER convenient!! Quickly found found what I was looking for at a cheap price! Don't order on Amazon and wait for a weeks shipping when you could come here!!< /text>

I want to give 5 stars for Joey and his excellent customer service. He was knowledgeable on all aspects of our vehicle and helped us get back on the road after we got our hands dirty doing some maintenance. Thank you again for all the help I recommend this establishment 100%< /Text>

Don’t get rotors turned here!!! I spent my whole day waiting. Took 4 hours longer then they said. They did it for free but I would have rather bought new rotors and not tied up my whole day.<//Review>

Great costumer service would give it a 6 star if I could thank you very much Charles for keeping your crew on there toes ever body that works here will try to investigate to make sure you are getting the right part might be a little more expensive that AutoZone but I do really appreciate the employees attitude and great quality parts too 👌<//review>

I had one of my headlamp bulbs burn out. Robert helped me determine the correct replacement and helped me install replacement bulbs for both headlamps (he suggested replacing both at the same time). Excellent service and they are always helpful at the Cameron park location.<//review>

THIS IS THE WORST AUTO PARTS PLACE IN EXISTENCE. I went in there to buy a headlight part and the employee I went up to asked me which kind I said I didn’t know and needed and he just said “Go figure it out and come back when you figure it out!” AND then a second later a middle aged man walks in needing help with the EXACT SAME THING and totally went to go help him out. THIS THE WORST AUTO OARTS STORE IN EXISTENCE!!! NEVER GO HERE 🤮🤮🤮🤮< /Text>

I don't know what these other losers problems are!  I've been in this store 3 or 4 times and always received outstanding service and assistance. Sometimes when the Placerville store is out of something , they always have it! I would have helped them kick that guy out of the store. It's amazing what rude people say when they try to explain what happened.< /Review>

Simply terrible service. I called in a part at 10:15am. They told me over the phone that the part would be available at 2:30pm. I arrived at the store at 3:30. The part hadn't arrived and they said it would be in at 4:10. I waited until 4:10 and the part still didn't arrive. They told me that the PART WOULD COME THE NEXT DAY?!?!?!?! I recommend you not shop at this oreilly's. They don't know what customer service is.<//Review>

Terrible. I will never shop here again and I buy a lot of parts. I ordered a part at 1:30, they said it would be in at 5:00. I went back and there was a new crew on hand and clueless as to what I wanted. The girl was rude rolled her eyes and was gone into the back for quite some time before I left. Drove back into town the next day for it only to find they never ordered it and rather than an apology I was kicked out of the store while having obscenities shouted my way. Unreal, I just wanted some parts. I have never been treated like this by a vender. I could have chosen many ways to get the parts such as the internet or Riebies but wanted the parts when they said they would have them. Fine they made a mistake, but to scream at me and kick me out rather than rectify it is just the oddest thing I’ve seen in a long time. I will never go back and would love to tell the owner why. Incredibly bad service.< /review>

<Review>Excellent! I've been going here for years and it's just gotten better! Great steaks, roast, chops and special made items. The hot deli is where I eat all the time. The lasagna is my favorite but they're all good! Also, try their sandwiches- you can't go wrong here!</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2d5cb9c89b22d:0x610af645c427b11b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This deli is a nice place to get meats and cheeses most stores don't have. They have a wide variety of pre made food for you to bring home for dinner. Lots of Italian cuisine,breads,pastas,cookies and cakes. Beautiful meat counter with more then you can decide on. Good eats everyone!!!< /review>

<Text>I used to come here and eat a dozen 12 christy's doughnuts when I was 21 years old and christy's doughnuts is cash only. They now opened a new vietnamese Pho Van restaurant here and their pho was not that bad. The Mexican seafood restaurant here Los Cabos Tacos y Mariscos I never tried in my life used to be KFC 12 years ago.< /Text>< Response>

My eye exam experience was great. The store was clean and had lots of frames to choose from. The wait was short and Dr. Lam was professional yet personable. He gave some great suggestions and got me in and out with a new prescription in hand, in just a few minutes. I was in a hurry today so I didn’t order frames but I did try some on.
Would highly recommend Lam Optometric Group to anyone who needs an eye exam.</review>

As always, Dr Islam, was great. I love the care and service they provide. Very detailed in explaining what is going on with your eyes, what to look forward to, and what to expect. They really care about their patients and would highly recommend.< /Text>

Dr. Lam is awesome!  Very efficient and sociable!  I enjoy coming in to see him because he’s so pleasant and there’s minimal wait time. I’ve been his patient for almost four years and now my son will be seeing him soon as well. Highly recommend him!<//review>

<text>Professional, friendly, positive group.

They see markers that are doing better or need to be looked at in the future. I feel like my eyes are safe here.<//text>< Resp>

dr was excellent  overcharged on frames for safety glasses costs weren't disclosed properly felt ripped off but out of time to stay and argue with floor representative because the entire thing took way too much time.  No point in setting limits for appointment times when they aren't followed<//Text>

Excellent Service from the moment you walk in the door. Dr Lam was extremely attentive to an allergy situation in my eye - in addition to giving me a thorough and informative exam. Bringing my fiancé to get checked!  I highly Recommend Dr Lam and his staff.<//Review>

OH MAN! Where do I start? A little background  first so I can put some perspective into my review here.. I have been wearing glasses since a very young age, second grade to be exact. I have a lot of astigmatism, like off the charts. Much later in life not to go into detail but I became sick and now have underlying issues and nerve damage that unfortunately affect many aspects of my health, my left eye being one of these targets. SO as you can imagine I have been to countless eye doctors, and have had countless exams, and have purchased an enormous amount of eyeglasses, I'm currently 35 so u can do the math lol. All jokes aside, and I mean this whole heartedly and with deep conviction. When I say Dr. Lam is the absolute best, I MEAN DR. LAM IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Not only is he the best eye physician I have ever seen but he is also one of the kindest,  smartest, caring,  charismatic, generous and patient men that I have the absolute pleasure of knowing. He takes his time with you and makes you feel 100% comfortable and will make your eye appointment a wonderful easy breezy experience. You can trust Dr. Lam. You have my word. And not only is Dr. Lam Amazing but his staff is as well!! The girls are BEYOND KIND AND KNOWLEDGEABLE! So this is not just a five star review for Dr. Lam but also for.. NATASHA!  ANNALISE!  ROSE!  KIM! and DENISE! You guys really have made such an amazing impact on my life, there is absolutely, and I mean ABSOLUTELY no where else and no one I would ever see again. YOU HAVE A PATIENT FOR LIFE!!!< /text>

I discoved the business on-line. Since they were geographically convenient, this was the place I was going for my eye exam. I got lucky!  The doctor has a great staff who have created a really calm, easy and relaxed atmosphere.  However,  they made the entire process quick and easy.  Besides being a staff of really nice and personable people, they were well versed in their  job and product.  They worked as a team, which created the efficiency. The best part was the picking the frames and thanks to their knowledge of face symmetry, I had chosen frames that best suited my face.
But the options are still plentiful.
The entire staff is great, but I dealt with Hugo, Michelle and Irving. They made the appointment(something I was avoiding) enjoyable!<//text>

<Text>Never actually received services here, we could not connect on a time.  Communication is key here.  Wanted a couples massage but when we showed up only one person was available. The place looked very clean and they did try to reschedule so I imagine this place is very good, great reviews, anxious to serve.  Just be very clear about what is needed and when.  Hope to use them in the future.< /Text>< Pictures>

Hot stone, deep tissue, and scraping for $60 full hour. Fit me in as a walk-in.  The best massage, worked hard to get out knots. I’d go every week if I lived there.<//text>

This place is a very good place to get a massage. Not like other massage places. I payed for full body massage and also the hot stones. It was very worth it. Not rushed service. Very kind people. I will be coming again when I need a massage to loosen up my body.<//text>

<review>This place is a hidden gem. Cindy knows how to give an excellent massage. She has a lot of massage experience and you will feel it. Unfortunately, it is hard to find this location haha. The sign is worn a bit and the door is locked until your appointment when you call and then someone will unlock it [if your appointment is later in the day]. The location vibe is a lil sketchy and can be uncomfortable at first but the massage makes up for it and the professionalism is on-point.</review><Gmap_id>0x8085808b68e5cdc7:0x445b972784f4d386</Gmap_id>< Date>

<review>Massage is one of the small pleasures I have in life.  Had such a great experience at Golia Beauty Center today.  The place is very clean and the service is top notch.  Marisa gave me one of the best Thai massages ever.  Her technique was great and her application of pressure was very consistent.  Will definitely go back!< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Even though we had to wait a while after our scheduled appointment, the massage and facial were amazing for the price! The masseuses were firm so I wasn't too ticklish like I usually am and they really got into any knots. Be patient and you'll get a great massage.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Excellent Chinese massage for an unreasonably good price. Cindy's studied medicine and actually knows what she's doing. Tina also is excellent (took my back apart and put it back together again).

I have no idea how this can exist in a city where coffee is $5, but if you go there and like them, definitely come back and write a review, so they can continue to exist.

Also they can validate your parking, so double awesome.<//review></record>

<Text>Firstly, you have to expect that you get what you pay for. You can't expect ultimate spa treatment as you would at some fancy hotel spa, for example. For the price, this was an amazing massage experience. Knots were kneaded out that I didn't even know existed. The staff doesn't seem to speak English very well, but I didn't find that to be a problem. ... They also gave me a banana, haha.<//Text><response>None<//response>< UserId.>

This is not shared anywhere on the menu.  Scammers and I would avoid - they could be scamming your credit card info/charges too.<//text>< Pictures>

My masseuse had a very poor technique, I had to say three times that I needed less pressure because I was getting hurt. (I usually ask for more pressure with other masseuses).

Hands down the worst massage center I've been to. The woman who was giving me the massage was also the receptionist of the center!! She refused to close the massage room door fully and was also constantly stepping out to talk to guests entering the center. Terrible!!</review>

I have been going to Solana Smiles for over three years now and I am constantly amazed at their devotion to their patients. I always recommend them to friends and family and am excited to have my children go there too. Just recently I had a tooth extracted and they did a marvelous job at not only extracting the tooth but also making sure I was comfortable. The devotion they have to their patients is apparent and they are always willing to go the extra step to make sure the patient is happy. Dr. Cordonnier went above and beyond to make sure I was in very little pain and that I was comfortable with my procedure. I promise to anyone looking for a new dentist, Solana Smiles is absolutely amazing and I’m so glad I have chosen them as my dentist!</review>

I was invited to employ a Solana Smiles voucher for a free initial implant assessment. I met with Dr. Vikili and her physician assistant. Both were very nice with a supportive attitude. The assessment was thorough, and Dr. Vikili explained both the implant process and the cost in.detail. Her estimate was many thousands of dollars less than a price quoted to me elsewhere. Dr. Vikili showed a genuine willingness to work with me on a financial payment plan. I have felt positive about my implant goal for the first time in years. I  highly recommend Solana Smiles<//Review>

This was a wonderful experience, it’s my fifth consultation for the same tooth implant. Everything from the first phone call to the follow up support was exceptional.
I realize everybody’s needs are different; however, this was by far not the most expensive solution for me needs!
I trust Solana Smiles implicitly, you should too!</text>

I interviewed at least 5 dentists for an implant after I broke a perfectly good tooth. Solana Smiles was the best price as they were having an implant special! I kept waiting to see what the “catch” was & I was SO fortunate. Azita Vakili DDS Solana Smiles, was not only an excellent dentist but very kind! It was painless and they make all their own implants so there’s no extra price for a “middle man”. She’s a bit of a perfectionist and has the best pricing that I have found! All the staff are upbeat & kind as well. Once while sitting in the waiting room, I heard her tell staff that if the elderly patient needs a ride to get there she’ll arrange it! Who does that? She’s more than a dentist, she cares about her staff AND her clients. I HIGHLY recommend Solana Smiles completely!<//review>

Solana Smiles made me feel very uncomfortable, implying that I had anxiety and needed a pill that would calm me down in order to undergo the extensive work they wanted to perform on me. When I inquired about the costs the people working with me (hygienist and front desk employee) became frustrated and did not seem to want to give me the information about coverage I requested (likely because their rates are astronomical). I feel grateful I decided to follow my instincts and no let them perform the procedures they recommended and got out of there with just a cleaning (which cost me in the hundreds). I am sure they perform great dental work, but the way they made me feel was certainly sub par.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Solana Smiles, the dentists and staff are all wonderful! I recently went in for a new crown on one of my molars. Definitely not my favorite thing to do, but they make it as easy and pain free as possible. I really like that they have a facility near that makes the crown while you wait. No need to make another appointment and have to come back on another day. I was so happy to get it all taken care of on ONE day. My tooth looks and feels great now. Thank you!</Review>< user>

< Review>
Great experience this week during my routine dental appointment. Jesse was quick to greet me with his friendly smile and positive attitude to ensure little wait time for my appointment . Staff exceed expectations every visit with their precision to details and expertise. I appreciated the follow-up calls and texts from Jessica( dental hygienist) and Jesse. I have been receiving my dental care  at Solana Smiles for over a year and have received excellent dental care from  the entire staff and dentists( caring, approachable, talented with up-to-date modern equipment) I highly recommend Solana Smiles for routine dental cleaning and for expert dental work(implants, fillings, etc).<//Review>

I love the front desk staff and the dentists'! Thank you Jesse and Dr. V for making each visit comfortable and fun! I like how each room plays soothing music (classical and ocean sounds) and they give you a pair of shades while they work on your teeth so the harsh light doesn't hurt your eyes. They always make you feel welcome and care about every aspect of your teeth!<//Review>

Dr. Vakili & the Solana Smiles’ staff is always reliable, professional, informative and will go out of there way to answer any question or help me in an emergency.  My health insurance does not include dental, so my out of pocket dental bills can be a concern. Solana Smiles recently started offering a solution to this:  Solana Smiles Club, wherein patients pay a small monthly fee and I can save $383/year on preventative care. I was especially impressed that Solana Smiles sent me this offer, essentially covering all of my recent check-up costs, the day BEFORE my appointment!  I recommend Solana Smiles to everyone!</Review>

<Review>I highly recommend Dr. Valkili and her entire team.  I came in to her distraught over losing a 5 tooth bridge, along with the rest of my upper teeth showing many problems.  I went from a woman who had a great smile to one facing losing her teeth and not much to work with due to bone loss in my upper jaw.
After going to 3 other specialists, I knew I was in the right place when I met Dr. Valkili.  She had ideas and solutions that no other doctor thought of and I could tell instantly that she was a true professional, and even better, had a wonderful personality.  I also noticed what a great rapport she has with her coworkers - they are all so friendly and despite a full upper jaw reconstruction, they made me feel at ease through every procedure.
On my big day, both Dr. Valkili and Dr. Leyla placed bone graphs in my entire upper jaw, performed a sinus lift, extracted my upper teeth, set 8 implants in the jawbone, and sent me home with teeth on the same day.  After that long day of surgery, I woke up the next morning with very little pain.  I was shocked as I was ready to suffer with all those extractions and implants.  Dr Valkili called me and answered all my questions.
This was a long procedure from the start to finish and Dr Valkili was there for me every step of the way.  Dr Leyla, also worked with me and she too is wonderful.  Everyone in their office is so friendly and competent.
A full arch implant is a complicated procedure and I would advise one to choose an experienced and skilled prosthodontist.  Don't settle for the high volume businesses - they did not even mention the necessary bone graphs and had I chose them I would have had fewer implants and not enough bone structure to support the arch. After my consult with Dr Valkili, she let me know that her plan was to provide me with strong teeth that will last forever.
Today was the final day of my procedure and my smile is stunning.  It looks natural and blends so well with my lower teeth.  The bone graphs were all successful and I am thrilled.  Dr Valkili is a rare find, she loves to laugh, and is so dedicated to her patients.
I could continue to rave about my experience as I am so satisfied with my beautiful teeth :)<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I love the whole office!  My son needs a lot of dental work and they are being  very strategic and kind about spreading out the work so I can pay a monthly.  amount I can afford.  I've gone to them for many years and I have no complaints.  I've been satisfied with all their service.  I like the dentists, hygienists and the office staff.  The office manager, Jessie, is always happy and encouraging.</review>

I have been to numerous dentists over the years,  and must say that I appreciate the professionalism of the staff. Dr. Vakili was able to tell me in detail all of the work that I need on my teeth, and why it is important to get it done. I felt very comfortable, and at ease discussing the issues with her because she was able to provide me with a solution without instilling the feeling of fear in me. I look forward to my upcoming appointment this Saturday!<//text>

Exceptional customer service!  If you have a fear or aversion to dental work and are looking for quality service look no further. The doctors and support team make you feel at ease from the moment you step inside. Everything is thoroughly explained from the very beginning and while the work is being performed. The work was masterfully done and I can’t stop smiling. Before Solana Smiles I never thought I’d be looking forward to my next dental visit.</Text>

< Review>
I am very sad to write this review.  I really like everyone at the office as they have always been so sweet.
However this review is about the quality of service I have received not the people’s personalities.
I first contacted Solana Smiles for invisiline teeth straighteners. I went to my consultation signed and they took molds of my mouth.
A few weeks later the trays arrived and I began wearing them. I did not know that they were not the Invisalign brand until much later in the process. The trays were not at all comfortable and cased issues with my gums, they caused cutting on my gums in the front above my front teeth and on my cheeks along the sides of my mouth. I made an appointment For this reason and they filed down the current trays I was wearing and it did help but that is not acceptable as you have to change trays every 10 days,.
After doing my own research I realized that I was given a knock off brand and not what I thought I was getting.
I casually brought this up at a follow up visit and was told that these were better for a few different reasons and I did not push the conversation or voice my disapproval.
I did not voice my disapproval of receiving something other than what I asked for, that was my mistake and it’s cost me thousands of  dollars. I am seeing a different dentist to start all over again with genuine Invisalign’s.

The second red flags for me was when I lost my insurance. I had quotes for all the necessary work I needed and the pricing with insurance.
The quotes went up substantially when the requoted me without insurance; At other places I have always received cash discounts because it is easier for the dentists as they do not have all of the red tape insurance issues to deal with, not here, every procedure was substantially more expensive. That really was a turn off for me. I started pricing out these procedures at other dentists and realized that they were double compared to the new quotes from the other dentists that I called.

One  of the procedure quotes that went up substantially in price after I lost my dental insurance was the gum contouring, I think that it is unethical to charge almost double the price When you don’t have insurance agencies capping the prices.

Another issue I had was a crown that I received from Solana smiles, a very short time after it was installed it came out while I was flossing, it was literally only a couple months at most after it was put in. I was having gum pain between the crown and the tooth behind it as well as food get caught inside of it. I made an appointment and they put it back in for me and told me to floss differently. They didn’t even ex-ray it to make sure it was properly fitted. I have always had issues with this crown but it was my first ever crown so I thought that it was normal.

Well last week it came out once again. So this time I decided to see a different dentist. According to this dentist I need a new crown because the one that Solana Smiles did was Ill fitting And too short (at the spot that was collecting food and were the gum was sore) I paid more money at Solana Smiles and happily might I add because I thought that I was getting quality, I feel that I was very wrong about that and should have learned from the fake Invisalign’s. Now I am out many thousands of dollars and have to do both of these procedures all over again.
I also want to say that I opted for Botox at S.S something that I never had done before, it was for TMJ, I am not sure why this happened but it did and it was concerning, the lymph nodes along my jawline became very inflamed, they were the size of green grapes. I have since had Botox at a different place and that did not happen again. I am extremely glad that I did not opt into letting them do any fillers in my face as I was going to do that in my last appointment with her, thanking my lucky stars for that.
Like I said, they were all very pleasant but I am not at all happy about the procedures that they did, now I am paying for everything all over again. I would caution you from going here.</Review>

After an exhaustive search for an office to perform implant surgery, I fortunately found Dr. Vakili's office. (There are a surprising number of ego-driven implant mills in Southern California, but Dr. Vakili's office is NOT one of them) From the very welcoming, efficient and yet personable front desk staff to what went on during the actual surgery, I couldn't have been in better hands. Dr. Vakili explained things well as the procedure progressed. I believe her expertise to be unsurpassed. I highly recommend this office and wouldn't think of going anywhere else!<//Text>

Dr. Vakili the best.  She always welcomes you and is willing to spend as much time with you as needed.  Prices are a little higher , but she is an expert.  You truly do get what you pay for.  Her staff is excellent!  They greet you with smiles and warmth!  Even though I had been out of state for several months, when I called to book an appointment,  they were able to see me .  I do refer friends and colleagues if they are looking for a dentist!  I needed my dentures reclined and fitted. I was able to get it done that day!< /text>

I have been a customer at Solana Smiles for 18 or so years. Dr Vakili and her team are amazing and she is the most skilled and caring dentist I have ever met. We trust her implicitly. This is not an office an office where they are always trying to sell you something, which I find very annoying. They genuinely care about your dental health as well as you as a patient. I would never go anywhere else. They are the best.</text>

I found this dentist office after 3 years of living in Carlsbad. I had very bad Dental experiences with several offices until I found Solana Smiles.

Dr. Vakili, and her staff are far superior to anyone I've even heard of in this area.  They created a dental plan for me, helped me with financing, and have done a superb job not only meeting but exceeding what they told me I could expect. Highly recommended!<//review>

I love this dental office. Dr. Vakili is a skilled dentist who truly cares for her patients. I have needed implants & other dental work that I have put off for financial reasons. I found Solana Smiles & have begun the process of returning my smile to a healthy one that I can show off. I have had two implants and a much needed cleaning so far. I’m happy with the quality and care I’m receiving at prices I can afford.</text>

Dr. Vakili is the best dentist I have ever had!! But Dr. Vakili is far more than a dentist as she has singularly extracted a tooth, done 2 root canals, placed implants in my mouth and most recently a crown all within 6 months. I never felt pain and Dr. V explained each procedure to me clearly and kept me informed throughout. In addition Solana Smiles and Dr. V have the latest technology in the office. My recent crown was completed in 1 hour without having to return a second time as is the case if your dentist takes impressions. She used digital technology and I was able to watch her create the crown on her computer screen. AMAZING and so is the front office manager Jesse. Solana Smiles is a family and I highly recommend that you join them!</Text>

Dr Vakili has been our dentist since the 1990s.  She is like family.  Always looking to make sure our dental needs are met and works with us in terms of the financial payments.   Her staff is always courteous, polite and accommodating.  Dr Vakili stays current with the new trends in dentistry.   I cannot recommend her highly enough<//Text>

Dr. Leila has lately taken care of me, she has addressed my dental situation with care and professionalism. The office staff accommodated me in a last minute need, and I got a chance to visit their office in Poway. They are resourceful and will not let you in an awkward dental situation. I am grateful to them.

Dr. Vaikli and her staff, Jessie, one of the most popular staff members in the office, are the best at making last minute room for me and this is a great start to find comfort when I am in pain. I like that team very much. They closely work together and you can feel this osmosis as soon as you step into this office. They are polite, respectful, knowledgeable.

It's an amazing and professional team that I visit frequently to get the best care for my jaw and hygiene of my mouth. They are the best, I trust them in any dental difficult situation and regarding hygiene care as well.. Thank you for all the hard work you got me to have me keep chewing, munching, talking... Yes I Can... Sylvie D.<//text>

Dr Vakili is knowledgeable, kind, and respectful of patient concerns. I feel right at home and cannot imagine going anywhere else for reconstructive work and basic procedures like new fillings. Her assistant and support staff are fantastic, too, and the office design lends itself to relaxation and positive sensations. I'm so glad I found Dr Vakili.< /Review>

<review>I have been a client of Dr. Vakili for approximately 20 years! My wife an myself really appreciate her professional care. Recently I took my handicapped brother in for some repairs after a fall. My brother was extremely nervous about seeing a dentist. Dr. Vakili and her staff were very effective in calming him down and when finished he was very comfortable going back to the dentist office. She is terrific with patients of all backgrounds and emotions. Both myself and my wife have had great dental maintenance performed by Dr. Vakili but we have also had reconstructive work done by her. Her staff is very thoughtful and welcoming to their patients. She is very talented and is completely up to  speed on the latest breakthroughs in American Dentistry. We are so blessed to have as a dentist.< /review>< user>

It was the first time I've had an implant without general anesthesia. It went pretty well with nitrous oxide and a responsive staff. However, the bone graft that had been done previously was too small, necessitating another one for several hundred additional dollars and a smaller implant. This will cause a big gap between my teeth that collects lots of food. I already have this problem from previous implants. It is disappointing.</Text>

I am a 68 year old woman and want to have my teeth straightened on advice from my dental hygienist.  I found Dr. Vakili on the internet and read reviews which were all good, so decided to make an appointment.  The reviews were spot on as everyone in the office is so nice and helpful, making sure you are comfortable and not in pain.  I enjoyed my visit and am looking forward to returning to start the Clear Correct program of straightening my teeth.<//text>

I would like to highly recommend my dentist, Dr. Azita Vakili, and her Solana Beach office and staff.  I have been seeing Dr. Vakili and her staff for all of my dental needs for about 10 years now.  Dr. Vakili and her staff also have provided dental care for my husband for 15 years.  Although I was satisfied with my previous dentist, I gave Dr. Vakili's office a try because of my husband's recommendation.  I couldn't be happier that I made the switch.

My husband, who is a recently retired Ph.D. Biotech research scientist was quick to point out that Dr. Vakili's Solana Beach office was equipped with state-of-the art dental equipment and not just the basics that most dental offices have.  As a fairly naive patient, this fact wasn't readily apparent to me, largely because her office is unpretentious and cosy and her staff have competent, yet "down to earth".  Dr. Vakili is trained in the latest dental procedures and can offer the best care because of both her training and her investment in the latest equipment for her patients.

I have been more than satisfied with Dr. Vakili's care and heartily recommend her dental practice with its state-of-the-art equipment to all.

<username>Dana Kettler</username><Time>1558707126541<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>It was a little nerve racking as I had to change drs after 10 years with my other dentist. My regular dentist was not in my network and I needed 2 new crowns. Too save money, I needed to find a dr in network.  I asked a good friend in dental sales who she’d recommend and she immediately said Dr Vakili. Fortunately Dr Vakili was in-network for me. What a blessing as she and her staff are amazing. I was there for quite some time that day getting the work done. They were attentive to my needs and made me feel so relaxed. They even have a lab on site so they built my crown there which meant I didn’t have to come back for a second appt. In all it was a wonderful experience. They made me feel part of their family at my first appt. wow! I was blown away with everyone that worked there. I would highly recommend them to any of my friends.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Cannot say enough about this wonderful practice and Dr. Vakili and staff. The office is beautifully decorated, welcoming, and not sterile like most. Jesse at the reception is kind and knowledgeable. Jessica was my hygenist and she was very skilled and sweet. I have gone through a lot of dental work over the past 4 years. I have gone to several dentists and not been happy with them. Dr. Vakili took the time to get to know me and my history. She is extremely knowledgeable and still wants to take the time to do her best. I have never been so happy with a healthcare provider and im actually looking forward to being under her care to make me more confident and happy about my smile. ❤️🙏🏼</Text>< pictures>

<review>I swear I didn't make them ask if I was ok, but the whole crew made sure I was during my long crown procedure. And the dreaded shots, hardly felt them since Dr Vakili is a wiz at it. And gotta love Jesse, who is a big fan of the doc and keeps people coming with his big personality.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
SCAMMERS! - I recently moved to southern CA and went for an initial consultation and was presented with a plan for all the “treatment” that I needed that was over $1,000. I’ve always had great teeth my whole life and have NEVER spent more than $150 at the dentist so I was very surprised. The office staff especially gave me the heebie-jeebies (pushy, over playing their expertise etc.) so I decided to defer any work. Boy am I glad that I did because I recently went back home and sure enough, my teeth are absolutely fine and I don’t need any work whatsoever!!

Maybe the principal(s) at Solana Smiles is eyeing a new porsche? I generally like to give the benefit of the doubt and maybe they are ok but based on my experience, I would NOT recommend them to anyone looking for an honest dental practitioner.< /Review>

My actual experience began before I entered her office.  When I was quoted $900 for an extraction.  In fact my former dentist had quoted me about 2/3 of the price Dr Vakili charged me for half of the work.
From my very first phone call with the adorable Jessie, and the way he raved of her service, I immediately felt I was speaking to a trusted friend.
That is the warmth and kindness I have received from every member of the office.
Hannah was my hygienist, and I could go on and on about her excitement and joy. She is sincerely interested in me and my teeth even taking extra time to help me find a quality toothbrush on line.
Zuzu does the billing and she can stretch a dime like it's made out of rubber.  I cannot say this enough.  The price you are quoted is the price you pay NO MATTER WHAT.  No little fees or tricks to confuse you after the fact. Additionally she is nice and works with your insurance to do the most.
Aya did my fittings and was sweet and quiet.  Everything she did fit perfectly.  Her work is impeccable.
Finally, I was fortunate to have both Dr Vakili and well as the talented Dr Leila do an extensive surgery on me.  It included multiple extractions and implants, as well as surgically raising my sinus cavity.  It took about 4 hours.  Fewer than 24 hours later, I am cleaning my house and feeling great.  My pain is completely controlled by Advil.  These results are so incredible, if it were not for the stitches  I wouldn't think they did anything at all.
And as a final side note, I refused any and all opiates.  Dr Vakili was extremely aware of the epidemic and welcomed the opportunity to work around that.  I was sedated completely and absolutely comfortable without the use of opiates.
What more can I say? Go to Solana Smiles.  Don't wait.  Go now.< /Review>

Saw her add on internet FREE CONSULTATION, 1299.00 FOR UPPER ARCH AND THE SAME FOR LOWER. NO CLARIFICATIONS OR INDICATIONS THAT IT WOULD COST MORE~!! SAW HER ONE TIME 10 MINUTES MY ESTIMATE WAS 3000.00 FOR EACH ARCH!! AND IMPLANTS MUCH MORE. SHE CHARGED ME 175.00! DID NOT ASK ME BEFORE CHARGING ME TO LOOK AT BITE!!! NOW I AM DISPUTING CHARGE AND SHE REFUSES TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. I AM REPORTING HER TO DENTAL BOARD FOR FALSE ADVERTISING! NOT HONEST, JUST WANTS TO GET YOU IN THE DOOR.</text>

Dr Vakili will be a good choice! Due to some health problems and hereditary problems with with my teeth, I am a person who has had serious dental pain and problems since I was a child. It came to a point in my life where I stopped wanting to go to the dentist because  was always more pain and bad news. Finally I came to a point where I could go no longer with constant tooth pain and because I had lost so many teeth. I went to Dr Vakili at Solana Smiles after some research and good reviews and it was the best decision I have made. The process was so much smoother and easier then I imagined. Dr Vakili and her office staff treated me with kindness, respect and dignity and never made me feel embarrassed about the condition of my teeth. The whole staff helped me through the entire process and gently guided me  until through this experience. They continue to help me resolve and issues that come up with my teeth.   I am so grateful to finally be free of pain and embarrassment. I would recommend Dr Vakili to my family, friends or to anyone in need of help for both dental problems and cosmetic dental procedures. You will not regret it!</Text>

I think this is the best place to get really good flowers. Nice service, great quality of a flower. The florist made a great arrangement of the flowers,  which was so impressive.  She made the wrapping elegant and fancy.   I was an awe of watching the beautiful flowers of this shop.   What a great flower shop has been.</text>

<review>This flower shop is highly recommended! They have different kinds of flowers than most of the city's flower shops do. They also had facilities for speed and fast distribution. Last week, on my mom's birthday, I ordered a bouquet from them, and it was delivered as they promised time. They had the most fun and talented florists, too!

Fast, fantastic service, and super inexpensive flower shop. New, beautiful, and well taken care of, are their flowers. For several years, I have been their loyal costumers and ordered many times already, and they never disappointed me. Placing my order was no problem at all and it was on time and top-notch how my order arrived. The rates are also very affordable.</Text>

Gorgeously done! The flowers that I ordered were provided right on, and it was beautifully arranged. This flower shop is really known for its beautiful flowers and amazing service, and I'm grateful that I was able to find them just in time. I'm certain that my wife would love these flowers, and thanks to you guys for making it happen. Keep it up!</text>

I was so happy that I found your flower shop near my place. I thanked your staff for giving me such a wonderful and fresh bouquet of tulips and daisies. I like your florist because she was very humble and accomodating. Thanks a lot, guys! Five stars for your flower shop! Very strongly recommended to all of my friends and family!<//Review>

<Review>OMG! This was such a pleasant experience. My mother was so surprised and amazed by the flowers she received yesterday. She really loved the arrangement of the bouquet and the flowers they used. It was delivered the same day and was on time. The delivery boy also was very informative and professional which I appreciated so much. Highly recommended!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c86b7b396f21:0x9294c0e72ea05d60<//gmapID></record>

I wanna give a five-star rating to this flower shop I used recently. All of the staff are very knowledgeable and knows exactly what they're are doing. All of the flowers displayed were imported, beautiful, and fresh. This is the best place for someone that needs affordable flowers. Highly recommend to everyone.</Text>

I take this opportunity to thank this flower shop for their assistance. It was difficult to order flowers for a co-worker who has lost a family member. They have the perfect flower arrangement for the occasion. We hope that most of the flower shops were like this. I am impressed with the service that they provided. Thanks again.< /text>

WOW! I went into this flower shop with a color scheme and a vague idea of what I wanted as my wedding. They delivered it right on time, and the flowers were beautiful and creative, and the arbor under which we said our vows was stunning! Even our venue was blown away! I can’t thank them enough for making a dream come true! I strongly recommend this flower shop.< /Review>

This place is a must for dining!!!  Husband had Cajun scramble and he really enjoyed it!  Jam is homemade, ranch so creamy also homemade! Onion rings were crisp, hot, so good with that ranch! Fries were decent, BLT was huge!  Flavorful bacon cooked to order, we also took home slices of their Apple pie (pies look like something out a Disney movie!) Daring Double Chocolate cake and carrot cake!
My husband wants to try more pie, chocolate cake so decadent smooth rich with a bit of a coffee taste, and carrot cake was so moist made with currants not raisins and homemade cream cheese frosting!  Diner has that 40's 50's era feel They make their own breads, muffins, pies, cakes, so many baked goods from scratch!
You can't go wrong coming here!<//Text>

Dessert: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Overall: I make special drives to from SF for this place.

The extended review...

Dessert:

Chocolate bread pudding - 5/5 - THIS IS A MUST!!!!  First I have to say that I never eat bread pudding but this is the exception to the rule.  It doesn’t taste like bread pudding.  It reminds me of a flourless chocolate cake.  You won’t be disappointed.

Service: 4/5 - Standard service depending on who you get.

Ambiance: 4/5 - A cool diner in the middle of Palo Alto.<//text>< pics>

The creamery will forever be a nostalgic amazing peninsular spot. Good custom omelets, great service, and diner vibes. My only gripe is that the prices have increased in the last 3 years, so it’s not great value anymore. Try the deserts or shakes if you have a sweet tooth!< /Text>

This place is consistently good. I fly to San Francisco monthly. While staying at the Nobu my daily routine is breakfast here, a slice of warm Apple Pie and hot tea. The Coconut cake is heavenly 😋. Light and melts in your mouth. Excellent service.</Text>

<review>We wanted a nice dinner and Palo Alto Creamery popped up. Looking at the dinner menu on line you would'nt have guessed the place to look like a retro diner. We ordered the steak meal, cherry crumb pie, and Palo Alto beers. Friendly staff, meals securely packed, and food was amazing. Mahalo for our last meal here in Palo Alto, CA.</review>< name>

< Review>
Service and baked goods are all amazing! Great outdoor patio with heat lamps for "dine-in" during the pandemic. Cocktails and sandwiches are a bit overpriced and underwhelming but the turkey chili is very tasty and you can tell great care has been put into it's creation. Also just to reiterate, the entire staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about all their dishes. And definitely don't skip dessert of any sorts here!<//Review>

Fall/Winter Seasonal Milkshakes are my favroite. Pumpkin and Eggnog are not to be missed! Everything on the menu is delicious and I love the old school diner feel. Customer service is great. Their ranch is one of my favourite things, and I take my ranch side seriously.< /Text>

It was tantalizing and enticing. World
class from top to bottom. Home
spun tales and fresh baked goods
that never failed to make one quest
for the communal yes Yes! They had
a salad featuring arugula and every
shake flavor known to Mars and

<user_name>Diana Griffin<//user_name><Review>The only real downside here that I have to seriously dock a star for is the paper straws. Christ, they are horrible.  Please look into another brand of paper straws that is more durable and doesn't soggy/break apart when you go to sip the milkshake.  Or consider switching back to plastic or some bamboo variant that doesn't break apart. The milkshakes are impossible to drink with a paper straw because of the extra effort you have to exert to get such a thick liquid up.  You end up weakening the entire structure of the paper straw and the top becomes frayed and gross.  We had to go back to downing it with spoons and cups.< /Review>< Response>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Good pie. to be honest, the service could be a little bit quicker on delivering a brownie and pie, since these we're already cooked items and all they had to do was serve it. Still, if I just have to wait 8 minutes in order to get some pretty decent pie, I guess that's good. Also we were out the door for under 20 bucks with a nice dessert for two people. Two enthusiastic thumbs up. Fine holiday fun for the entire family.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFpPr6I0yJKi0AgSYgrMnEhmPGCi-JYh8XeGR0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzSr6T1rN2B0wwrcxVZJef28brmb22uMSRB-u3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxW6PDwR224VHr8k4nMKJmTjYr83hofhjz5RFr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808fbb3a2291a8c9:0xd0a096ff58745aa4<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>Atmosphere: Super American cafe feel, nailed from the employees to decor to menu.

Dessert: Below average-- we got the brownie a la mode (while not on the menu, just ordered brownie + ice cream scoop). The brownie wasn't very rich and tasted kind of bland and rubbery? And the ice cream was also kind of watery and not too creamy.

Also note that it's not a standalone ice cream place, it's a cafe with desserts as a side hustle.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIgqUC1DIjNG73HSc1NODSKkZUKYwHgT2Dr7iu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqEu3ibO5V_dVSGufunvOVFi_Ni_G67c3mwAVi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOivqExw-mxHo3YSEc-GzS5QJQm-eIn5Ypn3W5Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

When you walk inside you get the feeling of an old time diner! It is super cool! There is a place to eat a full meal and a place to by pies and baked goods which are very good! I even got the chance to talk to the workers and found out that the place had been open since 1923! This place is a fun place to stop and would recommend to anyone who wants to look back to the past!< /Review>

It's pretty much what you'd expect from a diner, which is essentially classic diner food (including very good milkshakes and pie). A little too expensive for five stars, but it is a ton of food so it probably evens out in the end!<//Review>

Great place with many varieties to choose from. I got the brioche French toast with ham steak & scrambled eggs. Has the old fashioned diner feel to it and I love that they have fresh loaves of bread for sale. My reason for 4 stars is because the ham steak was a bit dry & I got my eggs pretty late. Our waitress was very nice so that swayed my rating too!<//review>

We went to this place for their famous pies but had a salad as well since we were hungry. The green apple, pecan salad was heavenly and the Apple pie was delicious as expected. I would def. recommend this place to everyone  ... The interiors are that of your typical American dinner!<//review>

I used to love their chocolate cake and wanted to taste their Apple pie. And this is what I found on it. Mold. Disgusting. And I particularly asked the guy to cut out a new piece and he refused. This is what I got. Some thing's changed in this place. The chocolate cake is now a rectangle and not as rich as it used to be.</text>

<review>One day a friend of mine reached out and said that he is craving some belgian waffles and asked if i know a good place. So i went on google and start looking for places, and landed here. We both met here around 4 pm , place was very nice and has nice diner feeling. I will be honest, booths were little small as me and my friend had to sit little side by side as our legs were touching. Well when we were about to order waffles, they said only served in breakfast time and we both went like nooooooo :(
Well we were there at 4 pm, what would can we expect. Server was nice enough to ask the kitchen and manager to see if they can make an exception, but the Manager was very polite and said it will take some time to heat the waffle irons and the kitchen crew is getting ready for dinner rush.  I went with french toasts and my friend ordered omelette. Food was really good. Loved the french toasts and my friend also loved the omelette. I would definitely come back sometime in breakfast to try the Belgian waffles< /review>< pics>

The food here is dependably delicious diner food. Also we'd never had anything from the bakery section before but we tried a peanut butter bar which was Soo good!  I always like choosing my milkshake flavor. And I love their tuna melts!< /Text>

This has been one of my favorite places for milkshakes for several years. They have a great selection of flavors and the taste is unlike anything I have ever sampled anywhere else. The food options are not that great but not bad either. If only the milkshakes did not have so many calories!< /Review>

The food was very basic and plain and the burgers didn’t have any flavor. The tortilla soup was surprisingly delicious. The price was not worth it. The old Creamery is right up the street, less expensive and very good.</text>

It was a good, all-American eatery. The food and milkshake were tasty. The coffee, at 7pm, was strong enough to put hair on your chest and to tow your car away too! The only downside was the price, being a couple dollars more a menu item (when compared to similar dinners) based solely on location. That said, not a bad choice for a Friday night.< /text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>Peninsula fountain and grill also called Palo Alto creamery is a great place for classic American delights including the thick milkshakes. I got the Mocha almond fudge shake and it was good but I would not say extraordinary. I have had milkshakes in other places in the bay area which are clearly better. the place packs a crowd at odd times which clearly shows the quality of the food.< /review>< gmapID>

Fun place to eat. Love the “malt shop” vibe though that term doesn’t do it true justice. Gained a couple of pounds just drooling over the luscious looking, over stuffed pies and giant cookies. My reuben sandwich and slaw were outstanding. My companion couldn’t stop marveling at the perfectly crisp texture and taste of his sweet potato fries.  Looking forward to my next visit.</Text>

Good wholesome food with a fun 1950's diner feel. Coffee is so-so, portions are big and food is flavorful. Price is reasonable for portion size. I keep coming back and voting with my wallet.<//Review>

I always dream of a place where I can get brunch at midnight. Though this place closes at midnight (at least on the weekend) that is close enough for me. I sometimes imagine all day how I will get brunch that night, and then a milkshake. This place is amazing. My one disappointment was the night I went and didn't realize they closed at 10pm on Tuesday, and saw them mopping the floor to the soundtrack of my crushed dreams. Everything else is perfection.< /review>

Probably the worst Americana style diner I have been to. Soda machine was busted. Chili burger was covered in some kind of black-bean onion stew that didn't really resemble Texas chili. Fries were overcooked and hard. Booth seating was weirdly split by wooden partitions making 4 top booths into awkward 2 top boots.

Staff were pleasant and responsive. Hence two stars instead of one.< /Text>

< Review>
I've gone several times for ice cream and shakes (so good!) But this was the first time tried them for breakfast. It was a decadent experience! I had the Caribbean french toast and my friend had the breakfast croissant. Flavors were wonderful. French toast was a good portion. Sandwich was a little small, as there wasn't much on it. It would be good if you weren't very hungry. Service was excellent, even though the restaurant was packed. I like the old fashioned ice cream parlor atmosphere. I will definitely go back for breakfast, which I believe they serve all day.<//Review>

<text>Staff is great. Breakfast is yummy. It’s also overpriced but it’s good breakfast. Dinner was the meal we had most recently here and oh my god it was disgusting. I would never recommend eating here unless it’s for breakfast.</text><UserId.>116620275193688888824< /UserId.>< Pics>

<review>My wife and I got ice cream on top of giant chocolate chip cookies. The both were good but I'd say this place is way overpriced. 9 dollars for a milkshake is a bit excessive. The service was a little slow and not very attentive, but pleasant when we did have interaction. My biggest reason for docking it 2 stars is the value: I think you can get much better ice cream for your money, even in Palo Alto.<//review>< pics>

This is my 3rd dining experience at the Palo Alto Creamery. I have never been disappointed and today was no exception. A simple Reuben Sandwich with cole slaw and onion rings on the side. All at our table have eaten at top tier restaurants across the country, and this meal just made us smile.
Good service with, with a pleasant ambiance
I will return.

I want to give it five stars simply on nostalgia. Have been eating here for 50 years. I think breakfast is their best menu. Northwest scramble has been my go to for a while now.< /text>

I've only been here for milkshakes, so my review reflects my experience with those.  They are good milkshakes.  I wouldn't say they're the best milkshakes I've ever had but still good nonetheless.  The milkshakes are just expensive.  I don't think they're worth what they cost.  The aesthetic in here is cool with the old diner feel, but that doesn't add enough to justify another star.< /text>

Note, the signage on the outside doesn't actually day "Palo Alto Creamery".  It's on the corner and is quite obviously a diner when you look inside.  I had pancakes eggs and bacon and it was legit.   The pancakes are next-level good!  Super friendly staff, an awesome menu, quality that's worth the premium cost. Definitely one of my new favorites!< /review>

Didn’t love it. It felt over priced for what you get, it doesn’t have a kids menu which feels weird for a burger joint. It felt like the waiters weren’t happy to be there, and weren’t very friendly. I was surprised it got such high reviews.< /Text>

Popular place with some diner food. We came with a group of 7 and were seated quickly. We just had desserts and they were all delicious. Tip: share. The portions are too big and rich for one. Service was also pretty good.</text>

We both chose to have the cranberry Apple salad and an order of Salmon. The salad was well balanced and very tasty. The Salmon was properly cooked and reasonably seasoned. The portion of Salmon could have been more generous. We also had an order of sweet potatoe fries which were very good. A very good choice for our dinner. They bake pies which I was very tempted to order but I resisted....maybe next time. Note that their sign says Peninsula fountain and grill...not Palo Alto Creamery.<//Text>

<Name>David Toy</Name><text>Google Global reviews, cool, here's my first. I've been eating here for many years and haven't given up on this place. It's one of my favorites in Palo Alto. It has an incredible selection of comfort foods, some are better than others. Overall it's much better than similar, family-style restaurants like Black Bear Diner, Denny's or  Applebee's.  It's not pretentious and not ever expected to be fine dinning. It's a fun place with a goal to provide good food fast. It is both convenient and consistent. Service is friendly and not always great, but at least more than "Just O.K.". I do have a soft spot for it because I respect the great bakery. Having put in some time as a manager-cook-baker-bartender at a Ski Resort Cafe and Bar in the High Sierras, I know how hard it is to be consistent at baking great breads, cakes and pies. They have a terrific baker(s) and the selection includes; fresh breads (huge loafs are readily available for take home), cakes that challenge the best cake shops, and my all time favorites, pies (fresh banana cream, key lime pie, pumpkin pie, apple pie, all are faves! try them all!). I'm a fan of classic milkshakes made the old fashioned way in the tall tin cups that fill your glass and still has plenty to share. Yep, their ice cream is the kind with full-flavor, lots of high fat-content, rich and delicious! I used to be hooked on mint-chip shakes, now I simply go mocha or chocolate. Both have flavor and substance, eat 'em up with a spoon! You'll be happy with whatever selection. One glitch recently, when my wife ordered Chicken Noodle soup and got a watered down Chicken soup with basic veggies and  added under-cooked pasta noodles. She returned it. They politely apologized, offered to redo it, she declined, and they took it off the tab, no questions asked. So, basic, high-quality diner food. There ya go. Happy trails.</text>< date>

I went after a gap of few years.  Ice cream was average.  Presentation and service were equally average.  They served ice cream in water cup.  5 years back, their ice cream was superb.  Wish same was the case now.<//Review>

This place had good service and good food so as a result I'll rate 5 stars. If a place has good service I usually let them slide since we can't leave half points. That being said, 4.1-4.9 would be appropriate. Sure there is some better food out there, but the service makes almost every meal taste better.

The staff is super fun and chime in when appropriate.

I got a milkshake!<//review>

One of my favorite places to eat in downtown Palo Alto, breakfast, lunch and dinner! Great flavors and friendly staff, can't beat freshly baked goods made everyday, and the original vintage decor will have you hooked! Also their shakes are amazing :) it's been around since the 1923!!! Wooooow< /review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Stopped in for a quick lunch. I had the soup and sandwich combo. It was good and just the right size. Most places go over board and give a huge half sandwich but not here. Instead it was just the right size.
The chicken noodle soup was very tasty and seemed home made. The milkshake was awesome as always.
Since they changed owners I always enjoy eating here.</text>< rating>

The name on the building is NOT the same as on Google Maps. This is the second time I have been to the Palo Alto Creamery. It is difficult to locate but from what I remember it was worth it. They have great food, great milkshakes, and great service. I would give it 5 stars but the price point here is what makes me lose interest. Might not come to this specific location for lunch again but definitely will be back for a milkshake to go.<//text>

Nice old diner feel. Main entree food was just OK. But the pies? The smell as you come in to the store was really promising... But the apple pie was so disappointing. The pastry was like cheap store bought oily, gritty, and left an unpleasant taste. The apple filling? Poor... Mushy like unflavored stewed apples. Prices are also high too</text>

Despite my silly questions and confusion about the menu, she answered them professionally and with a great attitude. So glad she was patient with me :) the food was so good, i love the diner feel at the creamery. It has such a fun and nostalgic environment there. The only thing is that i wish they were able to have more of a variety of substituites. It seems like their menu/menu items arent customizable. Other than that amazing food and team!!< /text>< pictures>

My other favorite place to go to when I need comfort food. Hot fudge sundae with the hot fudge on the side and all the toppings and a New York steak sandwich. These things are well prepared and again the service is wonderful they're here to give good service. It reminds me of the old Bob's Big Boy that I used to go to when I was little and the flavors of that New York steak sandwich remind me of that hamburger and their ice cream is absolutely wonderful<//Text>

It was really good! We got the mixberry pie and it was gorgeous. It wasn't sweet and had the perfect amount of crust. It's a solid recommendation from me.

Although... We also ordered apple pie and it wasn't the best. It was sour and had some weird plastic like stuff in it.

But go. You WILL like something :)< /Text>

Beautiful and authentic place.
Nice, polite and professional staff, great "back-to-the-basics" diner food.
Amazing bakery on-site and desert offer. Very friendly atmosphere with pricing within usual Palo Alto, CA comfort food standards. Typical, breakfast-lunch-dinner-snack menu combinations served at any time of the day. To bad it isn't a 24/7 type of operation.</Review>

Eggs Benedict with potatoes were verty good and stayed hot due the simple act of using a hot plate. Belgian waffle also very nice and good thick slices of toast.  Coffee was better than average as well add being very hot. It's the little things. The staff were pleasant and attentive. Comfortable chairs as well.</Review>

One word - Delicious!!! Their bread and baked goods are made in house so you know they're fresh. The milkshakes are mixed at the counter and are always a generous proportion.

Great service and fun atmosphere.< /review>

SO so classic!! You won't get better burgers and shakes in a more authentic feeling setting. Real soda jerks create floats and shakes. The servers even slick their hair up 50's style. Delicious food and always a good time! This place gets PACKED though, so go early.</Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Lovely diner, tucked into a corner in Palo Alto. When you open the doors, you are welcomed by a classic diner feel. Red seats, warm smell of coffee and cookies. The menu had the usual diner fare along with sandwiches & salads. Their coffee is one of the best I've tasted, smooth, hot and tastes just right with some milk. Food and service is good. I've never waited for a table. They are open late and have breakfast all day :)</text></record></dataset><record>

Great bakery: you may be surprised that a place known for burgers and fries could have a fabulous bakery but it's true!  They have great breakfast pastries (an amazing almond croissant!),  excellent cookies and bars along with full-fledged desserts such as pies and cakes.  Definitely the best in Palo Alto.< /Review>

We had a lovely server named Jose. He was very good with the students we took there who weren't good in their English. He spoke slowly so that they understood and was very patient. The food was amazing as always. The milkshakes are the best.</review>

This place might have been great 50 years ago, but it's a bit tired. The food was passable, but at the prices they're charging I'd expect higher quality food.

The apple pie was a disappointing miss. The cheesecake was a hit.</review>

Food was not so great.  Especially when I ordered the house special hashbrown pie.  The best thing about the dish was the raspberry jam.  The rest of the food was way over priced for the quality.  My 12 year old could make s better breakfast.<//text>

Such an awesome late night diner. The burgers and other plates are cheap and filling, but the best thing are the pies and especially the shakes. Omg the shakes. So delicious and a great variety to choose from. They bring your shake in a glass, and also the tumbler it was made in. So much to milkshake. These milkshakes will definitely keep me bringing me back to their yard.<//review>

Although I am a foodie, I have never been one to care much about service. However, this restaurant has the most attentive and quick service that I have ever experienced. The waitress really knew the menu and did not hesitate when I asked for a recommendation. The food, furthermore, is as good as the service. Great place.</Review>

If they have so many positive ratings it is for a reason, excellent food and above all, such a lovely staff. Really hope to come back soon.< /review>

<review>My dining partner  got it right when he said that Palo Alto Creamery was the Disneyland of diners. It looks the part,  has a menu that appeals to everyone with a few items that are a little high brow, the food is perfect looking but isn't nearly as tasty,  and it costs about 2x what you would expect to pay for that meal anywhere else.

Given all that it's no where nearmy first brunch choice,  but when you want breakfast at dinner time it's here or Dennys/ IHOP.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ6Sd9zn_6sHPingHBYtAENn0K5A8o-l7aa0k2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

Very good breakfast. Pancakes are fluffy, the corn beef hash is very good. Didn't get to try their cinnamon rolls since they were sold out. A good sign. Service is friendly even though there is often a pretty long wait for brunch. Sit at the counter to avoid waiting too long.</review>

It's a charming spot and a Palo Alto staple. Haven't ever had a bad experience.

The short ribs are delicious. I used to work nearby and would regulalry stop by to pick up the short ribs and an Oreo mint milkshake. Never got old.

Recently stopped by for a sweet treat and my wife and I fell in love with the chocolate bread pudding (get a scoop of vanilla ice cream).</Review>

<Review>Best. Place. Ever. I loved it here. The staff are amazing, the food is beautifully cooked, tasty and we'll thought through. This is clearly a business that knows just how to do things right. If I could I would eat here every day, maybe two or three times. The fries are outstanding as are the pancakes. Oh, and the cherry ice cream. If you're anywhere nearby, just go.<//Review>< Pics>

I like getting the burgers and breakfast is also good. The menu offers a lot of variety which is nice, but the prices are a bit high. I've tried the milkshakes, apple pie, and cake and they were all just okay. You can easily walk to other places nearby for dessert.<//Review>

Nice homey aesthetics, warm service. The food is good, but doesn't stray far from your typical breakfast diner fare. The prices are a bit high but that's normal for Palo Alto.< /Text>

The BEST milkshakes!  Soda jerks make authentic milkshakes that are rich in flavor and easily substitute for 1/2 a meal minimum.  Coupled with a California Burger, it's enough food to satisfy all but the largest of appetites.  Service is friendly and attentive.  They have pies too, but I have never had enough room to try one, but they look good!  Next time!  Parking on the street or underneath City Hall a block away on Hamilton and Ramona.</text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>I returned to revisit their milkshakes as a late night treat, and this time I ordered a brownie/cookie dough milkshake with malt and extra thick.  Although this was an expensive endeavor since everything cost extra, it was well worth it.  The milkshake was perfection in a metal cup.

I'm so happy that I gave this place a second shot.  It definitely attracts quite the crowd on the weekend in the evening, so come ready to wait if you have a bigger party.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Caribbean French Toast was very delicious. Highly recommended.
I liked funny decorations from 50's. Our waitress had a good sense of humor.
Warning: huge portions. One must be really hungry to eat all of it.</Review>

This is definitely a great to go place for your typical American style dinner food. The burgers are good. The milkshakes are pretty good too.< /text>

Love the food and atmosphere but the prices are high. I'm sure the prices are high from the terrible PA rent.< /Review>

<Text>On the expensive side for dinner food. Also, the service isn't very flexible. We asked for some changes to the meal and was just told no. If I'm paying restaurant prices I expect better service. And, clearly there's some catering to a higher prices clientele if you're going to put expensive wine and champagne on the menu. Probably won't go back.< /Text><name>Chris McQueen< /name>< pictures>

This place is fun for a late diner style dinner.   Great pie, breakfast served at night (which i love).  My only complaint would be the price is a bit high, but that's what you get coming to a restaurant in Palo Alto!<//text>

This is one of my go-to places for whenever I'm in the mood for diner food, a slice of pie, or a milkshake. Service is good and the ambiance has that cute, 50's diner feel. I spend hours here just reading, eating and people-watching.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808fbb3a2291a8c9:0xd0a096ff58745aa4<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Oversized tasty breakfast and great pie&ice cream. Try steak&eggs, blueberry pie, pecan pie with any ice cream. Thank me later. The only con is the place is too packed and tables are two small that everything falls down...</Review>

My biggest issue is at one point the baked breads were put on racks and rolling trays that were left right next to the bathroom doors. Pretty unsanitary and I lost my appetite after seeing that.

<Review>Another old Palo Alto favorite.  I miss the funkiness of the original, when it was an old diner rather than a new retro diner, the tacky decorations, the limited menu, the odd wait staff, and the occasional confusion with the Peninsula Creamery back when they had a restaurant on University... But it's a diner in downtown Palo Alto where you can still have a grilled cheese and a Green River take gone a fresh-baked pie. Reimagined, but still groovy.</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
The diner has the look. The food was unremarkable - we ordered an atomic burger (not hot), brioche french toast (average), and hash browns (average). Perhaps the time (busy lunch hour) factored in, or the holiday season - but this establishment is not worthy of praise beyond nostalgia. Regret not walking further and trying something else.</review>

Amazing ice creams and milk shakes. Name of the place is different though. Took me a while to figure out. Thought the place had closed down.< /Review>

My In-laws live here in Palo Alto, and this has been a regular stop for them. Great diner style dishes, great service, great value.</Text>

Very noisy place when crowded. Funky popular old-time ice-cream shop ambience, with savoy seating. Especially appealing to the Millenial and after dance crowds for late night food (before midnight closing on Fri. & Sat.)  Expensive prices. Desserts & Milkshakes - terrific (5 stars here! 👌)
I personally enjoy their turkey dinner, or the toasted egg-salad sandwich. They also serve soups, salad, side dishes, hamburgers, fries, onion rings, breakfast dinners all day long, and more.  They have a multitude of ice cream flavor choices and they are all very good 😀!  This shop is especially known for their yummy big, thick shakes. Re-enact that experience of being a wide-eyed kid that just found a treasure! Check out their fabulous home-made pies and other baked goods, as well.  OMG! 🙃</review>

<Text>I love the feel of this place, great atmosphere like you stepped into a 50's diner. My hamburger, the California burger, was huge however kind of dry and just a little off. My wife had a Reuben which I stole a couple bites of and was amazing! They have a huge selection of food and I will definitely go back to try the breakfast, lunch or dinner. They also have a magical section of pastries, pies and cookies on display. I wanted to have an old fashioned milkshake but couldn't fathom spending 10 dollars on one although they looked good. 3 stars for pricing as with a bowl of soup, a hamburger and a Reuben, coffee and a soda we spent almost 70 dollars, very pricey for lunch in my opinion. Worth a visit but be ready to spend some cash.</Text>< user>

<rating>5<//rating><username>Ray Liu<//username><review>THE place for milk shakes in the Peninsula. You just can't find any where else nearby that comes close to the burgers, fries, and shake experience that you get at the Creamery. We always get the California burger and one of their entrees and split them, and we're always satisfied. A really great place for any occasion. Skip the dessert though, the milkshakes are much better than the cookies or pies.<//review><response>None</response><Date>1344317888561< /Date><user_id>111965032186709439771< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Used to go here at least once a week when I was closer to University. Haven't been there for about a year. What a difference a year makes. The staff that I used to see there for years are all gone. Replaced by standard issue "don't really care" employees.  But most of all, the food has suffered the most. Smaller portions, dryer burgers, smaller shakes.  Still a decent "tourist trap" to take out of towners, but you'll be better served getting a burger elsewhere for a while. I hope they fix what I feel is now wrong with a once great eatery.<//text>< Pics>

A dining institution in Palo Alto, always a favorite. While waiting for food, my kids love to play records at the original jukebox (10c plays one song, 1 quarter plays 3) or going over the selection of cakes and cookies on display in the bakery section.<//Review>

<text>Plenty breakfast choices and great cinnamon roll, which is a must-try. The other recommendation is lobster roll that only comes every Friday. This place used to be run by Peninsula creamery (900 High St.). Peninsula creamery still owns the land and as they mentioned on their website, the Palo Alto creamery is required to maintain this 50's style soda fountain, which I think they do a great job.< /text>< Time>

this place works on so many levels - great diner food, ambience (especially outdoor seating in warm weather), and the helpful and efficient wait staff.  i recommend going with their staples, they don't do inventive so well.  breakfast is hard to beat (hash brown pie!), and the burgers for lunch.  shakes anytime (my kids order 'em for breakfast).  i find the california burger very hard to beat.< /Text>

The ambiance here is consistent, for better or worse. A lot of good ice cream choices and a big menu, but I've been a few times and never feel you get your money's worth here. For example, boring cheeseburger = $13+. There are a lot of good burger places in Palo Alto.<//review>

A classic diner with tons of options for dessert. God for families, singles, or even a romantic date. Search for parking in the street. Great staff.</Text>

The food is just wonderful, a great variety of dishes and I can't begin to talk about the service. Everyone is super friendly, I went for brunch in my birthday and they brought a candle in my scramble eggs. The prices are ok for the area, and there is a free public parking a block away.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Don't however, confuse it with the "Peninsula Creamery" which is down the road (900 High Street) and closes early.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I wish I could give this place negative stars. I went there for breakfast for the first time and I can tell you it will be the last time. . I should have known better when I ordered a Chilli cheese omelette and the server didn't know what it was. The food was very very blance and exteremely unappetising. The potatoes looked over burnt, over cooked and grey. When I gave the manager feedback, all they could do was reduce my bill by $3. For the price that you pay at this place ($16.95 for the omelette) this was a very bad experience indeed. Honestly, you are better off going to Denny's as teh food is much better and the manager will care a lot more.

One other thing about the potatoes, I was told that they are cooked in bacon fat, I wonder if they tell their vegetarian customers that as I did not see that information on the menu</Text>< pics>

<Text>I absolutely love the Palo Alto Creamery. With a traditional American diner feel, it's as if you've stepped back in time. It's the perfect place for weekend brunch, though you may have to wait a while if you'd prefer a table to sitting at the fountain bar. It's worth the wait!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I had a traditional all american breakfast which was really good. Service is nice and fast and the decoration is from 1950's. Which is strange since they have only been in business since 1988. I'm guessing they must've purchase and fitted the diner with the vintage furniture. Either way, I would come back if I lived around here.<//Text>< name>

Busy place.  I only had ice cream. Hot fudge Sundae which was too large for the glass.  Annoying.  I am ok with a bowl.  Mint chip ice cream was good.<//Text>

A diner is only as good as its hash browns.  This place has pretty solid hash browns, and the other breakfast fare is good as well.  It's a little overpriced, but what isn't in PA?<//review>

<Text>This is a great classic american diner. Food is great, service is as good. Its always busy no matter the time of day which is always a good indicator. This is a great place for a leisurely breakfast at weekends. The menu is vast so be prepared for some tough decisions. Pancakes and waffles are amazing but I really love their benedicts.<//Text><user_id>103445751288057276599< /user_id></record>

Simple and traditional American breakfast cafe.   It also has dinner menu to suit everyone .  If you are tired of fusion or up scale restaurant , this is good alternative.   Only  down side is very noisy.</Review>

Definitely a hometown diner, good sized portions of tasty foods. They make these bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers that came on a bed of salad, super fancy for a diner joint.  My hubby loved them but they were too hot, Hot, HOT for my taste buds.  Good thing I had a strawberry malt to cool my mouth off, it was more like one and a half strawberry malts... sweet I'm not complaining: sugar, dairy, yum.  Our waitress was lively and at times forgetful, but she made the experience enjoyable.  I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu.< /Review>

This place is reputation is a little overrated the foods average sometimes there's a 30 minute wait so it's good to get there early it's like an old-fashioned ice cream parlor</text>

They're practically meal-shakes. Yes, you're normally a healthy eater—leave that at home. Don't be afraid of adding multiple mix ins. I'll have mine with peanut butter and hot fudge. Be prepared for the sugar coma.

P.S. Look for the giant cookie poster. Its "not actual size" caption always gives me a laugh.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<name>Manny Aguilar<//name><review>Delecious and great service. For this visit, I got myself the "Huevos Rancheros with the eggs over easy". The eggs go on top of a tortilla that is cooked just over the pan and it's perfectly soft with the eggs in the sauce over. The sauce has a nice kick, just over mild. You want to mix the sauce with the eggs, all the way down to the tortilla and add a touch of beans; delicioso!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

Ok food.
Great service.

I juts don't understand why you'd eat a burger here or other American food when there's definitely a better selection in downtown Palo Alto.

The desserts on the other hand are TO DIE FOR. Delicious!< /Review>

Surprised this restaurant was so well reviewed. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and as far as places go, it was quite subpar. Ended up with indigestion afterwards. We also ordered a grilled cheese and it came with fake cheese. (Like Kraft cheese...) Uh, not acceptable. For a restaurant in downtown Palo Alto, I expected more.

Pass.< /Text>

One word: MILKSHAKES.

Palo Alto Creamery is the perfect place to for brunch or a quick afternoon snack where you can consume a million calories in a matter of minutes.  But, they will be the most delicious calories of your life.  The milkshakes here are absolutely delicious.  Smooth and creamy with a variety of ice cream flavors and mix-in options.  I went with an oreo milk shake and my friend had the oreo mint chip + peanut butter.  I definitely inhaled mine and it disappeared very quickly so, I moved onto my sister's peppermint shake.

One milkshake is large enough to share with two people but get your own to avoid awkward situations.  I love the old-town casual vibes and prompt and friendly service here.<//Review>

They invent some interesting ice creme flavors, but there's a reason those flavors haven't gone mainstream.</text>

<text>Sadly a stain on the holiness of the authentic American diner experience. We were directed to sit in a booth with a torn open upholstery -  I've seen more aesthetic seating on a BART train. Mediocrity in Palo Alto? Yesssssssss. Stay away from ordering...actually stay away from anything COOKED, except the corned beef -- it was edible!!  The omelette was not made from fresh eggs - you can tell when they're evenly yellow in color - they were from a homogenized egg mix (from carton source - convenient don't you know). And the hash browns were thoroughly  cooked into a congealed starch patty. Best to stick to the "Creamery" aspect, eg ice cream or shakes<//text></record>

<Review>Came for the old fashioned nostalgic ambience and if that's all you're after, it it's fine - but the food was overpriced, small portions and lower quality.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Great traditional American food. But the server's on both occasions, are always chatting to each other, non stop. I sat for ten minutes at the counter, then got my own menue, as I was making my mind up, the Latina women were," busy" moving a few plates back and forth in front of the chef window . They kept chatting as finally one of them took my order. The meal was great, But.. asked for water, she put it right in front of her side of the counter. And took almost 20 minuts just to get her attention(STILL CHATTING) with the others. Then add i asked for my check, she THEN slides it towards me saying,",it was right here." Placed next to the water on her side of the counter. No tip. Great food,crapy lazy female servers.<//Text>< pics>

Potato pancakes are delish. OMG I could eat them every weekend. They are kinda like latkes but not dried out. Do note that they take 20 mins to make as the potatoes are shredded to order and then they have to cook it. Seriously it's worth the wait.

I also totally love their french dip! Great place for a classic shake or malt.

Great americanna diner food that many of us have come to love.< /text>

I want to like this place.  It's fun and colorful, parking isn't too awful, and the servers are pretty nice and attentive.  Plus they serve breakfast all day!

But alas, in my two times eating here so far, the food has been just... meh.  Not especially flavorful or interesting.  Today I ordered the huevos rancheros and they were simply bland :-(.  A bit of guac or pico de gallo would have spiced things up a bit, but alas, there was none of that.

Last time, I had some baked chicken that was similarly bland.  Not awful, not badly cooked, just... nothing I would ever go out of my way to order again.

I'm not expecting art from my diner food.  But I would like some more satisfaction.<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It's a diner like The American Diner.
I had breakfast, but the croissant egg sandwich and croissant were crispy and delicious!
As for fruits, melons are harder than in Japan, and they are not ripe. However, there is America, so don't worry.
It's a shop that is always busy from the morning!

(Original)
ザ・アメリカンダイナーというようなダイナーです。
朝食をいただきましたが、クロワッサンのたまごサンド、クロワッサンがサクサクで美味しかったです！
フルーツは、やはり日本と比べるとメロンは固め・・など熟れていない感じ。ですが、アメリカあるあるなので気にせず。
いつも朝から賑わっているお店です！</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The closest in Palo Alto to the "diner" experience of the 50s, including the legendary and fantastic milkshakes (ultra-dense) served in traditional metal containers, which Douglas Hofstadter hints at in an article describing how, being at Stanford , the game "undercut" was invented, which took me long hours during the first career classes. Some metal containers that, by the way, then copied the Vips in Mexico and Spain

This was called Peninsula Creamery, and it still puts that on the door, but in the 80s the original owners (who continue to maintain the property of the premises) gave the management to others, with some conditions (including how to present and serve the milkshakes) . The first owners maintain another place in Palo Alto, less central and with more limited schedules (they close at 5pm every day ...), which we have not come to visit

The site is full at all times, because it is a great option for breakfast, for lunch and for dinner, and even for a drink between meals. The audience is quite diverse, as appropriate, and you find both old age and teenage couples (and of course families)

The hamburgers are excellent, one of the best so far on this visit to the USA. And the chicken quesadilla is tremendous, with a spicy guacamole quite appreciable

I would say it is an essential place in Palo Alto, or in general if you go to Stanford

Lo más cercano en Palo Alto a la experiencia "diner" de los 50, incluidos los legendarios y fantásticos batidos (ultradensos) servidos en tradicionales recipientes metálicos, a los que hace alusión Douglas Hofstadter en un artículo en el que describe cómo, estando en Stanford, se inventó el juego "undercut", que me tuvo ocupado largas horas durante las clases de primero de carrera. Unos recipientes metálicos que, por cierto, luego copió el Vips en México y España

Esto se llamaba Peninsula Creamery, y aún pone eso en la puerta, pero en los 80 los dueños originales (que siguen manteniendo la propiedad del local) cedieron la gestión a otros, con algunas condiciones (incluida la forma de presentar y servir los batidos). Los primeros dueños mantienen otro local en Palo Alto, menos céntrico y con horarios más limitados (cierran a las 5pm todos los días...), que no hemos llegado a visitar

El sitio está lleno a todas horas, porque es una gran opción para desayunar, para comer y para cenar, e incluso para tomar algo entre horas. El público es bastante variopinto, como corresponde, y te encuentras tanto vejetes como parejas de adolescentes (y por supuesto familias)

Las hamburguesas son excelentes, de las mejores hasta ahora en esta visita a USA. Y la quesadilla de pollo es tremenda, con un guacamole picante bastante apreciable

Yo diría que es un sitio imprescindible en Palo Alto, o en general si vas a Stanford< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>
