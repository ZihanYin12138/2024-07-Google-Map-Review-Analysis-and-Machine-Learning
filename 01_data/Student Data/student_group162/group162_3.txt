I’m very particular about who works on my bike. Been taking it to R. Tillery now for a few years, and I’ve never had a bad experience. Brea and Scott are knowledgeable, friendly and honest. I drive an hour from where I live just to give this shop my business. I’ve stopped in while out riding because something wasn’t feeling or sounding right on the bike, and Scott took the time to check it out and make sure I was okay to get back on the road. Safety is very important to me because I ride some pretty twisty roads, so knowing I can stop by their shop and be taken seriously when I have any concerns is extremely important to me. Highly recommend this shop.< /Review>

<Review>Scott just wanted to thank you again for a job well done it may be routine to you but it was a big deal to me . You were more than fair and way quicker than expected . You took time to walk me through everything that you were doing and explained it to me in a way that could easily be understood . You definitely take care of the home team . Anyone would benefit from your services . The bike runs fantastic I couldn’t be happier thanks man your rock!!!<//Review><resp>{'time': 1612574187862, 'text': 'Awesome man.

I approached Scott on 2/20/2021 about installing a quickshifter on my bike, and he quoted me "around $500.00," and told me to bring it the coming Thursday night so he could work on it the next day. That sounded a bit steep considering I already had the quickshifter, so I informed him someone else was willing to do it for half that, and thanked him for his time. When  my alternate fell through, I reached out to Scott via email to ask if he would like to go ahead with the job. He did not respond, so I called the shop, and the lady who answered informed me that Scott was no longer interested in helping me out. Why? Because I was hoping to save a buck through someone else? Watch out for this one. Not professional at all.</text>

Rtillery's is a superb,super friendly buisness that i would refer anyone to. Just for an example I was in an accident and Scott went out of his way to check out my bike and give me his opinion.. Not many other buissness owners would do that... Thanks Scott & Brea

< Review>
Scott is the best mechanic in the area hands down. If I can’t work on it he is the one I trust with my bike.
There is a reason why r Tillery is still around when all the other private shops from that era are long gone.
Awesome dude, highly recommended!</Review>

<review>Just made my first visit to this shop and I feel like I won the lottery to find professionals I completely trust my bike to on the first try.

These guys obviously ride and are happy to talk motorcycles, riding spots, and perform timely repairs. That’s the definition of value.

Thanks Scott and Nick!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Let me tell you a story.... I'm a new rider  and new to motorcycling.  I laid down my brand new 2019 GSXR 600.  I received my bike back in better condition than when I bought it.  Scott is always giving free advice.   What is better is that his wife Brea works the desk.  She rides too.  I walked in there feeling ridiculous and received reassurance we all fall.  I also got an education about gear and riding.  They're amazing people and I still owe them cookies!!<//text>

These guys did a tire re and re super fast while I was just cruising through town on a road trip. Good price, tightened and replaced some loose bolts that weren’t even tire or wheel related. Oiled my chain even though it was the front that got changed. Good stuff.< /Review>

Took my XR400 down that had been sitting for a while.  Wouldn’t start, fuel leak, dirty inside and out.. Scott and the team tore it down, cleaned it up and got it back to brand new!  They treated this old thing like it was a high end race bike.  After taking it to R Tillery it starts within 2 kicks even if I forget to choke it.  Amazing work by amazing people!  I would recommend them to ANYONE...  and I have!< /Text>

I brought my bike in there 2 times for him to diagnose and repair a stutter it’s doing. Both times the bike did it again not even a mile away from his shop. 3rd time he quoted me $600 for a valve adjustment that the bike also didn’t need!

Then he dug out the exact pads I needed. The price of the pads was good, but the free lesson was the value. Scott was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. I highly recommend R.

<review>After talking with several shops in town, a friend suggested I call Scott at Rtillery. Glad I did! Scott was great, he was the only shop that asked me what type of riding I do and am looking to do in order to put me with the right tires. I had an opportunity to speak with about 10 different customers at the shop, ALL had nothing but great things to say about Rtillery. Saved a ton of money and learned a few things about my bike I didn’t know, he loves to teach and talk about bikes. I have found my motorcycle mechanic going forward and made a new friend.
Thanks Scott

AWESOME! I am a full time traveling Rv'er with a BMW 650 X Country. Rear brake trouble in the middle of nowhere and no shops willing to work on BMW. Heard about R Tillery and contacted Scott and was told to come on in. He fit me in and had me back on the road in a day! Well worth the drive to Bakersfield. I'll always go to him anytime I"m in the area. Friendly, caring, and professional. Highest recommendations!</text>

This is one of the most fair and reasonable shops I have ever brought my bikes too. Scott has always bent over backwards to make sure my bikes have been repaired quickly and right. His knowledge and enthusiasm for the community are above the rest. I can not say enough great things about rtillery.
Thank you Scott for all your amazing service!< /Review>

My old chain broke on my way to work one day. I eventually took my bike in and Scott replaced the chain and used some sprockets I purchased online and he also installed a front tire for me. I got a message a couple hours later saying my bike will be ready shortly. His work is very professional and finished in a timely manner. I highly recommend him to anybody.</text>

<Review>Scott, and Brea, are An amazing team and treat their customers like family. Always taking care of the customers first and explaining what and why things need to be done. Scott goes out of his way to help customers and give them the best route for their bikes. Never had an issue that couldn’t be fixed and never had a more knowledgeable person working on my bike. Highly recommend trying the shop out and if you have any questions please feel free to ask Scott. He always has time to explain what’s going on and does right by his customers. Great man, husband and mechanic!<//Review><Date>1542849009745</Date>< user>

<Text>I always seem to buy projects, every time i ride down there, part of me is embarrassed  because I am just not the  usual "Hey I need a quick tire change" guy.  Scott and the crew have always taken on anything I have and fixed it. My first CBR years ago had an odd engine stall issue when hot. 3 shops out of town where i used to live could not fix it, Scott took 1 day, found the problem and i was riding again.  There are not many places you can go where kids are welcome to tag along, it's a family environment. They have my business for life.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Scott and Bria are amazing.  When I moved to Bakersfield, the first thing I asked about was a good bike shop.  I was told about R Tillery, and boy were they right.  No bullspit, just honest work for an unbeatable price. My bike just recently broke down and after the holidays my budget was super tight.   They hooked it up and at a fraction of the price I expected it to be.  They have a customer for life.  Two thumbs up, my bike rides like a dream.  Love you guys.<//Review>

I took my Ninja to R Tillery. They are experienced & knowledgeable. The price was competitive. They are dependable and they can be trusted. I received honest and accurate recommendations on my bikes condition and needed repairs. They made the repairs I agreed to, and my bike runs great! I was pleased with my experience. I trust this place with my bike and I will be returning in the future.</text>

These guys saved the day! I was from out of the area and noticed cords showing on my rear tire(emergency!) on my way to LA. Not only did they stay open two hours after closeing they we're able to give me a ride to the nearest cycle gear to get the new tire! I'm so grateful for their above and beyond customer service! I would bring my ninja back here any day for repairs and I recommend their shop to anyone in need of quality service</review>

<Text>Scott and company are low key but very professional, more importantly they are helpful and honest. Scott will always do right by you. After being burned at other shops in Bakersfield these folks are the only ones that I trust my bikes to. I have brought them some complex jobs and they have always come through.< /Text>< pics>

Been going to R Tillery Powersports for over 10 years now. From bbqs, dyno days, and turning wrenches at the shop. Scott has always been humbled and a stand up guy. Very knowledgeable and fair on his pricing.  Thanks Scott for many dedicated years.

<Text>I can’t say enough positive things about my experiences over the years with Scott and everyone there. When I was street riding I took my bikes to Rtillery for everything from simple accessories like fender eliminator kits, to full on race parts later when I was racing. In addition to the great ability he has to diagnose and fix problems you can feel comfortable that he is giving you the right answers and NOT trying to extra jam parts and unnecessary pieces or procedures into the bill to boost his profits. He’s probly one of the most honest people I’ve ever met in the motorcycle industry and elsewhere. If you haven’t already stopped in to see this passionate small business I’d recommend it, I promise you’ll have a great experience.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Its been about 9 years ago that i took Scott my 1999 yz250 engine for a rebuild. It turns out that the casing had a crack where the oildrain plug is at and it was leaking oil, and so they told me about it and offered to weld the crack to repair it but that the oil changes will be done from the clutch cover. I accepted the idea. They told me that the original crank was still good so i kept it to keep the cost low. The motor had the bearings and all seals replaced and we went with a vertex cast piston. I've ridden this dirtbike almost every weekend for about 3 hours per ride for the past 9 years ever since, and never has anything failed on it. Compression has always been good and i replaced the top end myself just because i wanted to inspect the piston (because 2-stroke) 3yrs ago and i went again with Vertex. The top-end was still good but replaced it anyway since i had already taken it apart. Needless to say, the guys' craftsmanship experience have stood the test of time on this example here at R tillery. I always bring my bikes here when i have an issue i can't solve and they never dissapoint. Thank you Scott and your team for the quality service.< /Text>

With out a doubt the best mechanic a man could ask for, excellent customer service, seemingly infinite wisdom of all things motorcycle, and best of all an amazing sense of humor. This is a one of a kind shop expierince I couldn't recommend more, stop by for an oil change and meet the family. Five stars every day!</text>

Scott, Nick, and Brea are all awesome, super helpful, and will take excellent care of you and your bike! Scott is incredibly knowledgeable  about anything on two wheels and is definitely the guy you need to talk to about any of your bike related needs! He has fixed any problem on any of the bikes I've had and I would trust him without a doubt to fix anything that might come up.< /text>

The previous owner had put them on wrong , he also noticed that there sprocket wasnt true and suggest I change it ( I had him change it ) he then checked the front and said the pads were good and that bleeding the system should correct it , he bled the system and the brakes work flawless now ! He also noticed my fork seals were leaking i didn't have the money to have them repaired at the time but came back about a month later and had him fix it , all in all Scott and crew are amazing and do great work at a reasonable cost and take care of there customers , everyone I know or who I run into and ask who I reccomend to have there bike serviced I always tell them r tillery powersports<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
Had a horrible expierence at this shop. My bike was at the shop for a month. I was asked to put 50% up front so Scott could pay his "Rent". After giving him $600 my parts were not ordered for almost a week. The bike was not ready when promised. Scott replaced my master cylinder on his recommendation and my bike did not brake any differently. When I tried to deal with him on these issues and others he was unbelievably unprofessional and rude. I was recommended to him by many people that had used him in the past. Like many things, people change and so do shops.< /Review>

Went in to get a chain but the one they had was too long so they offered to cut it down to the size I needed for free! On top of that I had my 3 yr old with me , they got it handled on the spot very quickly and gave my son free stickers! . Got a very good vibe from all the guys they are very friendly and dont mind answering questions. definitely recomend this shop over anyone els in town. They got my business from now on.<//Text>

These are some really amazing guys. I was down in the area and my throttle cable snapped. By sheer luck these guys had the part,used, that I needed when not one shop or parts store in the area had one new or used. Even though I did have a 1985 cruiser and they generally work on sports bikes in the last 10 years they worked with my bike. If I ever get a sports bike and move down to the area I'm defintely going to head over whenever I need some work done.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>R. Tillery is, by far, the most professional shop that you could go to in Bakersfield. Scott and Nick are two of the nicest, most honest mechanics, and they know what they're doing. I have been coming to the shop for a couple years now. More recently, though, I came into the shop complaining of a braking issue. Within moments of my description of how the bike feels on track, Scott already knew what the problem was and they got to work. Thank you R. Tillery Powersports,  you made the process of getting the bike fixed, pain-free!

TLDR: Go to R. Tillery to fix your bike! You won't regret it.</Review>< pics>

<date>1299390694971</date><review>The guys at Cycle Gear turned me on to R. Tillery. I was tired of being ripped off by the dealer. These guys do great work. They got my exhuast at a very fair price. They always treat my bike with kid gloves. Today when I had a flat, they hung out at the shop three hours after closing time until I could get it there on the tow truck. Don't hesitate to do business with them.</review></record>

< review>
These guys are LEGIT!!! Great customer service, the most knowledgeable, and prices are very reasonable. I felt super grateful when i took my bike thinking it had some electrical problems. Through their knowledge and expertise they moved some wires around and bamm, lights turned back on. They  didnt charge me one penny. If they were money hungry dudes they would have taken the bike in and charged me who knows how much and would have ripped me off. Super grateful with these guys!!<//review>

I have immeasurable trust in Scott's shop to make sure any motorcycle I own is mechanically safe to maximum speed and back to zero.< /text>

I have had my valves adjusted, tires replaced, oil changed, galfer brake lines, and bigger brake pads installed. My bike is currently in his shop awaiting repairs (slow insurance) after I took a dive on a So Cal freeway. I live an hour away from RTillery Power Sports and I don't trust any one more with my bike then Scott and his crew. I have gone to multiple dealers and motorcycle "mechanics" and no one compares. When my valves were adjusted the bike felt brand new and the power delivery was amazing. Recently after I had my brake lines and brake pads installed I had to Smash on my front and rear to avoid a high side crash. Luckily due to advice taken to get bigger pads I was spared more then just a broken collar bone. Thank you for all that you do. Honest and Reliable. Hard to find these days.<//Text>

<text>Honest and knowledgable. I've taken my Honda Silverwing scooter there several times because the owner Scott Tillery knows his stuff.

Although they don't normally work on scooters, Scott helped me out. My steering stem ball bearings were shot and my bike would fall to the left when I'd let go of the steering. He quoted me $300 for the repair because he didn't know how much work was needed - he basically made an educated guess on the problem based on the feel and look of the steering column.

After taking off the tupperware myself, he dropped it down to $212. I was happy.

The next day, he called me and said it was ready. My bike felt amazing! To top it off, he dropped down to "A hundred bucks" because it was easier than he thought it was going to be. I was ecstatic because I saved $200 from what I originally thought. Any other person might have kept the $112 extra.

I will definitely go to him from now on.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) I can recommend this place. Scott and his team are professionals in what they do I am Hispanic and my English is not the best ... but Scott treated me very kindly ..... previously I took my motorcycle to another place and they told me that My motorcycle was no longer useful for me to sell it in parts ... but what was my surprise that Scott solved the problem in two hours of work !!!! Now he enjoyed my motorcycle without problems !! No one will touch my motorcycle ...... well ... just Scott and his team

<text>We came in to this store to get my mom some shoes. As we walked in there were  3 employees all of them inside the register. We didn't get greeted when we were inside. We finally found the shoe style we wanted and my husband had to go to the register and ask if they had it in the size we were looking for. They didn't. So he asked if they could check if another store had it and her response was...."we can order it for you". He got on Google called the store in Lynnwood and trough the phone they told him the one in the citadel had it. We then called citadel and they placed the shoe on hold. There was only 1 other customer in the store and didn't see any of three employees say a word to her. They all just stood in the register.

We went to the store at the citadel and we're greeted as we approached the door. While my husband was in line one of the employees went around asking if anyone needed help. As we left the store we were thanked for stopping buy.

So if you are looking for shoes save yourself some time and drive out to the citadel. Where they can actually help you find a stye, where they actually greet you and where you are appreciated for your business.<//text>< time>

Although all the guys there are great.... Bonnie as well, we usually get Chris. He has taken care of my three boys for several years now and Is great with of them. Recently my husband went and Bonnie was super. Highly recommend this place. Don’t think you’d be disappointed by anyone there.<//Review>

<Review>I had a great experience. My haircut came out exactly the way I wanted. I just showered Juan a picture of what I wanted, and he nailed it. He double checked what I wanted before starting. My cut was very clean, and was girlfriend approved. I will definitely go back again.</Review><name>David Brown< /name><Rate>5</Rate>< Gmap_id>

<Text>So, you’ve decided to let your beard grow out. Or, you want to get that hair under control. What should you do? Fantastic question. See one of the awesome pros at O.T.G.P. My guy is Dave, but ANY of the peeps at the shop can get you looking right! Dave helps me maintain my beard on the weekly! I always walk, no strut, out looking my best. The shop is always clean and fresh. The conversation is awesome with all of the staff. They take the time to get to know me. Honestly, at this point it’s like going over to chill at a buddy’s place. It’s truly the highlight of my week! Remember to book with Dave. He is MY barber. And, my friend.</Text><time>1582077949472< /time>< rating>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I'm normally around in San Diego and I have my usual place there, but I asked a friend wheres a decent place to have a cut was and this was it. Mo did a stellar job figuring out what I wanted in my style and laid it out. I definitely enjoyed the straight razor shave at the end, which is their finishing move there.

More expensive by only two or three dollars than the regular barbers, but you'll leave thinking about how great the cut was. Thanks!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I found this place by accident while visiting Nicks Deli. The atmosphere is pretty legit, it Almost has a man cave vide but it's totally family friendly. I come here mostly to get my beard trimmed, and if you know me I'm very particular about who cuts my beard. This place has been trimming my beard for almost a year now and they've been consistent each time. If you have sons or you, yourself are looking for a place to get a trim... This is th place. Just make sure to bring cash, as they don't accept plastic.<//text>

<Review>I took my 18 month old to get his haircut for the holidays. We were greeted by all the barbers as we walked in. Javier did a fantastic job! He was very patient with my son as he is not used to hair cuts. Very good work, extremely friendly staff. I will definitely be bringing my son here again.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dd2e60cd225e35:0xc62a42d7559f406c</gmap_id>< user_id>

Old traditions is hands down the best shop I've ever been to. These guys are professionals in every aspect of what they do. If you need your hair done the right way do yourself a favor and give these guys a shot. Brad did an outstanding job on my hair and I will be a frequent customer from now on.</Review>

This place is amazing. I have been getting my hair cut from Dave Lopez for about 6 months now, and I have yet to receive a bad haircut. You are always greeted by one of the crew with a friendly hello. 25$ for hair cut, hot shaving cream line up, hot towel, and a mini shoulder massage! Amazing!
Just make sure you set an appointment, and ask for dave.< /Text>

I rarely get my hair cut, so I've never really had shop loyalty. With all that hoping around I have never had such quality hair care. Beer, hot towel, everything.

I had no idea what to ask for and Chris helped my out. Gave him my best joke as a thanks, hope it bounces around the shop.<//Review>

Haircut takes a little under an hour long and comes with a straight razor, hot towel, and shoulder massage .

Everything from being greeted to the level of detail that the barber's show to each client is unbelievable.

Great place for an old school detail-oriented man's haircut. They don't rush and take good care of their guests, including a straight razor with hot foam around the edges, after shave, hot towel, and the whole experience. This is a revival of a dying art form on men's grooming. Shop is cash only, but on my visit, Dave took care of me and he accepts cards through Square, if you'll cover his processing fee. Appointments are recommended, buy they will handle walk-ins.< /review>

Dr. Tubis and his staff are outstanding with the dental services they provide to their patients. They are honest, caring, trustworthy and experts in their respective fields. Every visit has been a positive experience for me. They have provided me with services like getting my teeth cleaned, fillings, getting crowns, and implants. They are the best. My oldest son has been seeing Dr. Tubis for over 20 years and has always been pleased with their services. At the front desk Gloria always goes out of her way to explain everything you need to know with the details you seek. In short I recommend Cameron Family Dental to anyone that seeks the best dental professionals.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Gloria always treats patients very kind and caring, as well as being prompt and good with what she does.
I was seen by both Gloria and Miguel and I had a very pleasant visit.
The facility itself is amazing with their cleanliness, and Gloria always makes it a point to remember you and your name for your next visit. I always feel very cared for when coming here and it isn’t like a typical dentist facility that rushes you in and out and shows no sympathy for your tooth aches.
I highly recommend coming here.<//text>< pictures>

From getting my teeth cleaned to a root canal, I wouldn’t recommend any other place! This dental office is the best one I’ve been too in a while. The staff is extremely friendly and the receptionist Gloria is always so helpful. I would Definitely recommend this place to anyone who is need of a new dental office to go to.<//Review>

My family has had dental service at Cameron Family for many years.  Dr Tubis and staff have provided great service and have become trusted friends.  They are very helpful with insurance issues, always explain procedures and if ever an issue they make it right.  I attribute the friendly atmosphere to Gloria who goes out of her way to be helpful.  Thank you to everyone,   E<//text>

<Text>The best Dental Office in town hands down!!! I have been coming in this office for the last 21 years, yes, it’s not a typo!!! The staff here are amazing! Gloria always finds a way to get an appointment if you needed one! Carol is the best Dental Hygienist I have ever known! Her steady hands makes me not feel a thing! And of course, the best Dentist in town, Dr. Tubis! He’s not just a very good Dentist, he is also very genuine, very caring and we always talk about the Lakers!!! Don’t just take my word for it, just schedule an appointment, get to know them, and I can guarantee that you will be here for the next 20 or more years of your Life!!!< /Text>< Pics>

So far since becoming a new patient I’ve had a great experience. I first went to a Dental group (will not say which one) and would not accept my insurance stating “my insurance doesn’t half the procedures and I needed and tried changing me $1200 out of pocket and referred me to a credit company. I came to Cameron family dentistry and charged me the same price but actually applied my insurance making my bill less than half of what I need to pay. And to make it easier, they didn’t refer me to a credit company, instead told me to pay each time I arrive for my appointment which breaks it down much to being more affordable. They also gave me credit for being referred by my coworker which made my second appointment at no cost. The front desk and dentist are all very friendly which is a huge plus. Highly recommend this place to get any of your teeth procedures done.<//Review>

This place stated that no co pay needed before treat patient.  After treatment then send bill.  When call regarding bill they give answer not too nice. No good customer services at all. If have zero star, I will give them zero.</Review>

< Review>
Had great experience from my first time there. Dr. Tubis is very knowledgeable and it shows with the work he had done. Practically painless. I've been going there ever since for the last four years. I would recommend him for anyone, especially for someone who hates going to the dentist office. The way he explained the procedures that he needed to work on, and the way he was going to do it  put my mind at ease. So far, best dental experience I had in a while.<//Review>

< Review>
Amazing!!! Thats the best way to describe this office.  Im what you would call and anxiety filled patient, but Dr Tubis and the office staff are absolutely 100% amazing.  Dr Tubis is kind, and gentle and takes his time, the assistants are kind and know what they are doing but also the front office staff goes above and beyond.  I have seen the endo, the oral surgeon and my kids see the pediatric dentist and 10 out of 10 recommend every single one!!! You wont regret it!<//Review>

This is not your average dental office. Dr. Tubis and his staff are amazingly attentive and caring and will work with you to make sure you are comfortable and at ease. It is rare to find a dentist that is honest and willing to go above and beyond. That's what sets this place apart.  On top of that you will not be sitting and waiting for extended periods of time and you will receive the very best dental care.  You will not find a better dental office!</Review>

< Review>
I tried the regular fried rice here and it was amazing for not even having beef, chicken, or shrimp… but it would be better if it did!!!  Also you need to come here for the lamb skewers!!!!  Sry no pics because my gf and I devoured them to quickly…. That’s how terrific it is…. And it’s a rule of thumb to eat them while they’re super hot.< /Review>

Lamb skewer tastes good. Some meat hard to chew.

Others are nice but not as good as lamb.

One bad: Chicken gristle is too hard to chew.

And it's kind of pricey.<//Text>

Authentic Chinese BBQ experience! And I should know as I have been living in China for 13 years, this branch has a "fatty beef skewer" specialty that is a must, cheap and cheerful you can't go wrong.< /review>

<Text>Delicious skewer things.  A bit steep on the price.  But super good and unique flavor.  Same with the noodle soup I had.

The flavor is unlike anything I ever tasted.  Almost like a middle eastern/chinese fusion.

Super, super spicy though. Don't say I didn't warn you.</Text><time>1573144197308</time>< user_id>

Perhaps it's not our taste, but we did not enjoy most of our food. We ordered 8 different skewers. All of them were coated in heavy cumin seasoning. The cumin was very strong and overpowering, while the marinade was weak. I don't know if it's authentic Chinese, but lamb, corn cobs, chicken gristle: it was all one seasoning.
We also got a "Pork & Tofu Casserole," which was a flavorful soup with glass noodles (albeit very few noodles).
The prices are a bit high, considering the adjacent restaurants in the same lot serve tastier food and charge less.
I would not recommend this place, but if the heavy-handed cumin seasoning sounds appealing to you, this might be the place for you.< /Text>

一份100刀的外卖用了一个小时去准备并且最后没有拿到全部菜品，原谅我实在无法等待一份韭菜一个小时没有烤完严重怀疑这家店自己种植。
Made a to go order and got hours to wait. After I called them made order I arrived the parking lot and I saw a group of girl walk into restaurant (notes, I made earlier order than them, after 5mints I walk inside I walk in there and paid the bill they told me, my food will ready be shortly. After 40 minutes I talk to them again I said that it’s not shortly for get my food. They said they still need more time but they ask me if I want to refund the dish they didn’t finish. By the end they give my order after I told them I do not want to wait for my last dish, and they give me refund for the last dish that I didn’t I didn’t received. By that time, those girls who I saw them walk-in to the restaurant, they are paying the bill. After all this I have to say, if you want make to go order at this restaurant,remember do it before at least an hour.</Review>

<username>JL Doan<//username><Time>1545170260213</Time><rating>3< /rating><review>I had originally intended to go to Tsuruhashi but the wait was way too long, so we decided to give Focus bbq a try. Surprisingly, it didn’t like the kind of bbq restaurant we were expecting.  The menu had many offerings in terms of stews and cold noodle dishes and skewers.  We had a cold Dan Dan noodle and beef stew.  Both of which were just ok in my opinion.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dbffe941d00001:0x2509df9ce4a10859</gmap_id></record>

<Time>1555473253999< /Time><Rating>4< /Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Need better ventilation. After eating a taste, all the clothes have to be changed. Colleagues thought I was going to be a chef. The food is very good. The price is a bit expensive. The floor should also be cleaned. Slimy. It is estimated that it has not been cleaned since its opening. There is room for improvement.

需要更好的通风 吃完一身味道 衣服全都要换 同事以为我去做大厨了呢。吃的是挺不错的 价格有点贵 地板也应该清洗一下了 黏糊糊的 估计开业到现在也没清扫过。还有进步的空间吧。< /Text>< pics>

<text>I ordered Penne A La Vodka through Uber Eats and the food was great! It came with two pieces of bread which I could’ve done without. I was a bit underwhelmed when I looked at the pasta because I love a very saucy and creamy pasta but they did not disappoint! The pasta was delicious! I can’t wait to order again! Next time I’ll get extra sauce. Also I paid $5 more for grill chicken added and it was sliced and mixed into the pasta so I fished it out to show what $5 gets you! Anyways I’ll be ordering again for sure!< /text><Time>1600915566306< /Time><user_name>Daniela Alvarado<//user_name>< rating>

< Review>
Great customer service and amazing food. It’s a small neighborhood staple and the locals love it. You see a lot of the same faces and it’s because it has that kind of Cheers vibe to it. When you hang out at the bar, you end up making some solid friendships and connections with great people. The drinks are great too! Jose is always a pleasure to have tending the bar and he makes the best margaritas! My favorite dish is the chicken parmigiana, but really everything is good there. Support your local small biz! This spot is worth keeping around! Best Italian food in the area if you don’t feel like driving to downtown. They treat the clientele like gold, take it from a long time customer.</Review>

Oh emmmm geeeeeee.
Never even knew this area was here. And im so glad I stumbled across it. Im in the middle of my food now and just wanted to stop and say wow. It is so freaking good and the server is SO nice and presentable. This is my new favorite place. Im eating the chicken Piccata. And just wow. Come here now. Eat this food. I rarely post reviews and again I stopped eating just to post this. I will come here as often as I can to eat more of this.  Also its Christmas time and they're playing the Santa clause. Everything is just perfect.</Text>

The staff was very friendly and very helpful. The food was ok and when we had a problem with one of the dishes, the staff took the plate away and offered us something else. But my girlfriend just decided to share my dish. When the check came, they still charged us for 50 percent of the plate even though she did sent it back because she believed the lobster in the ravioli to be old.< /Review>

Love this place, although i do wish they provided more shrimp/sausage/whatever meat you ordered with the plate. For the price, i hope they can since we absolutely LOVE their food. Their Alfredo sauce is amazing.<//Text>

Have been three times, had minestrone soup with fresh vegetables, gluten free pizza, special friends dinner $10 was steak and orzo pesto rice, yum! Everyone has different taste but the food deserves a 5 star and service outstanding. We went there after having a disappointing meal at a local Italian place down by Vons in the same shopping center. We go now every Sunday , visiting my Wife’s mother . Try it, the specials are great.< /review>< pics>

<review>Updated February 1, 2020: I'm  deducting one star. The food is good, and the service amazing. But, I find the food quality to be inconsistent.  We've had Friday night pizza 3 of the last 4 Fridays from state of Italy.  The 1st time it was perfect. Perfect.
2nd time our pizza crusts were both burnt
3rd time the crusts were perfect but the. Pizza/marinara sauce tasted like it was undercooked, the flavors just weren't as full bodied and mature as the previous Nights.

My son offered to buy pizza when I picked him up from a night class at Cuyamaca College. We were going to get it from another pizza place in this mall, but they were expensive and it didn't even smell good.
As soon as we pulled into a parking space at Taste of Italy we could smell delicious cheesey garlic bread cooking. And as we looked at the menu on the patio a woman dining inside stuck her head out the window and said, your love it, it's delicious!
And it is. We bought the 16 in pizza to go with pepperoni, meatballs and mushrooms. So good<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Racist and petty. We were a group of 10, but had to sit separately into a table of 4 and a table of 6 with 2 separate checks; instead of allowing me to pay my own gratuity, he charged me an automatic gratuity and said we he could starting at a table of 8, but for the caucasian group of 4 with us, allowed them to pay gratuity on their own 🤷🏽‍♂️ I will never go there again. Not to mention they do not use salt. The same shrimp they use for shrimp cocktail is the same shrimp used in the shrimp alfredo, bland and blanched. The same for the alfredo sauce and for the calamari. Was a terrible experience thanks to their assumptions and prejudice.< /Review>< pics>

I have mixed feelings about this place. I believe the prices are too high for the quality of food and I don't like the smell of alcohol and cigarettes that is usually there. However, there are never long waits and the staff is always very nice.<//Review>

The waiter came to the table and said in front of all that they could only honor 1 of the coupons. They were gift certs. He then proceeded to provide the worst service I have received.

<review>These guys were awesome! I was looking for visors and a wheel for a 2002 truck. They found me some that worked, though not the exact parts, they took them out for me and the price was great.

The key was these guys know enough about cars to know what parts will substitute ok. The visors installed fine, but are a tad too long so they don’t fit in the little catch. Still, way better than no visors, and the price was right!

The tire was close enough in size to use as a spare.
Fast and efficient service. Excellent experience!
Great prices!<//review>< resp>

Once you buy part and if it is broken they'll never refund, they'll give you store credit and don't even have a system to record it. If you loose your receipt you lost your money. What a disgrace! Shame on you!</text>

Great staff. They were friendly and great to deal with. They have a huge lot of parts available at reasonable prices. I picked up a rear shaft for my 03 Sequoia. It fit perfectly without any issues. Highly recommended.</text>

I called to ask why and I was told that that was the price of the battery. After arguing about the price the transfered me to a different person who told me that that was for a core charge and that I would get the money back once they have the battery back. They already had the battery and the one they sold me was defective. I was told that they would send me another battery and that they would send me a receipt for the credit on the core. That never happened.  I did n ot have the defective battery out so they wouldn't leave the new one and they made me pay $75 more for a redelivery for a defective battery. had to call 4 times and I still don't have my core credit. let's see what happens in the next couple of days< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_name>

<Review>AT&T is the worst company by far, they can’t help me with my problems about a promotion and keep sending out cases and coming up with excuses. It’s been almost a year and they still haven’t been able to solve my issue. All because one of their associates made a mistake , now I’m stuck paying full price and not getting honored my promotion. Leaving them as soon as my contract ends.</Review>< Pictures>

Scammer was trying order from my att account and change the name on my account. I wanted to block them asap, but He smiled and ignored me. I was there to get help. He was there to sell phone. I was not bringing any profit so I was pushed around and bullied by Robert.<//Text>< gmapID>

<review>I came into this store with full intentions on upgrading my phone.Before I could even say which phone I wanted the gentlemen working told me “you need to be more specific”. At that point I totally lost interest of getting a phone. I’ll take my business else where and another employee will make the commission on getting me a new phone. Wish I got the guys name who was working, but I don’t care to know anyways cause I’ll never come here again and nobody should either!< /review>< pictures>

The look on his face tells me already he didnt want to spend the time and energy to do his job then instead tell me to go online or call the number. He think I didnt know i tried that but i let him talk his way out of doing his job because i called earlier saying they need to verify my ID for me to activate my sim card. Its pretty pathetic we still have people like that make everyone else look bad cuz of his very bad customer service or that lost cause of an employee he is.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>Not honest.  Overcharged and misleading.  I wanted to cancel but they didn’t allow me to do so.  They wanted us to pay cancellation fees restocking fees.
I really had a bad day there with Sales rep Eric Escobedo and his manager.
I would not recommend anybody to do business with them.<//Text><rate>1< /rate><username>hanh ngo< /username><user>112224009927602740194<//user>< Pics>

Alex was amazing!!! He went above and beyond while assisting me to update to a new phone. He kept a positive attitude the entire two hours while the system was slow. He could have easily told me to go to another store but he didn’t give up. I am so thankful!!! I have never had this kind of service at any store. He made me and my son feel very welcome. Thank you again Alex!!!<//text>

Very awful experience!!
The manager Robert is rude. He did help me fix my problem with his pejorative attitude. When the problem was fixed, I asked his help to understand why my prepay on 30, Jun. with international package 5 dollars but I need to pay 5 dollars again to get this service for July. Guess what? He took out money from his pocket and said he will pay me 5 dollars.

What an insulting behavior!!
As an AT&T customer, the question l asked is to understand how AT&T calculates my bill. If he is not professional to answer, that’s fine. Trying to insult customers is definitely unprofessional.

Today’s experience makes me wonder how AT&T trained, educated or evaluated his staffs.
I myself manage a small business, which provides 40 AT&T lines for my salesman. It’s time to review with my IT and Sales division.</review>

<review>Whoever the manager is here needs to quit. My mom came to pay our Uverse bill in cash and the manager promptly told her to wait before being helped. There was no other person in the store, and the manager was texting on his phone and told her to wait. Are you serious? He also made a mistake counting the money and also applied it to the wrong account. He applied the amount on our cellphone bill that had no balance, instead of the Uverse cable bill. He then proceeded to act rude to my mom stating that it was her mistake and she didn't give him the right amount, disregarding the sticky note she put on top of the money that stated the right amount of cash for the bill. This manager is rude and unprofessional, who treated my mom with disrespect. Bare in mind my mom has trouble speaking English, so imagine how it felt for her. If I   was with her, this would be totally different situation and I would've handled it differently. The manager shouldve apologized for his negligence in paying attention, stop being on his phone, and actually do his job.</review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

The tech I was working with was great, very knowledgeable, friendly, and demonstrated a passion for wanting to solve my issue. I'm only rating 3 stars because the store manager was pretty unprofessional. He had a newer tech on the floor that was clearly still going through training and he verbally scolded him in front of me and other customers. This just isn't something you do as a manager, those should be personal conversations.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Came here on a Friday at noon for the deal on their unlimited prepaid plan (switching from a different carrier). Seems like the store was under staffed but I was in no hurry. Robert, the manager, helped me and within several minutes my phone number was transferred and I was able to use my phone immediately with no down time.

Waited over an hour to make payment. With 2 other customers ahead waiting. Two salesmen with other customers. I understand it time consuming for sale processing or upgrading to a new phone, but so do salesmen. Sign in sheet had check boxes for what your business is; “Sales”, “Service” or “Other”. I checked “other” and wrote payment after that hoping that it would catch a salesman eye. Whether it did or not, it didn’t help. I arrived around 4:30pm and time on receipt was 5:43pm. I don’t fault the salesmen, it’s probably protocol. It would be nice to have salesmen handle customers with payment only before addressing customers with issues that may be time consuming. There were still only 2 salesmen when I left.
This has been my only negative experience, you want to call it that, at an AT&T store.< /review>

Yesterday I vistited the AT&T store at 436 N Capitol Ave, San Jose CA.  I was assisted by a smart, kind manager named  Robert M Moline.  He was so helpful  to solve all the question and issues i have with  AT&T and got myself another new IPHONE 8 with everything running smoothly

Wish him the best ..</text>

EVERY TIME I COME HERE....it's the same thing over & over again. I've been here maybe 4 time, only because it's by my moms house. The bold guy that works here is the MOST ignorant person. Every person that walks in he looks & doesn't even bother helping them out. He once read the list & skipped my name. What does he win by doing that. Just recently I waited while that all talked about stealing phone, & about how some people are stupid. All while ONE worked. I genuinely hate & dread coming here. Horrible customer service.</Text>

<Review>UNBELIEVABLY unprofessional! I’ve never been spoken to with this much disrespect by anybody.. let alone a store manager! I went in to get help on an offer their store was running for the new iPhone and forget about helping, the manager just didn’t even try. When My husband asked as well, he started being SO RUDE! he started to yell and his way of “helping” was to ask me - “god ok so do you even know your phone number??” Or “do you even know anything”...like I was an illiterate person .. totally ridiculous! My husband and I were beyond shocked at how a store manager at AT&T can speak to a customer who’s been with them for over 10 years with this degree of rudeness! SHOCKING! I mean there were so many things he said I can’t type it all but believe me, I’ve never seen someone like him!
He’s Bald and rude ... don’t go to this store. Read all the other reviews.. he’s beyond unprofessional.
We’re never coming back here and none of my friends ever will. Go to the Pall alto location ... that is truly amazing customer service. This place really should be shut down if they keep such freaks on their staff.<//Review><username>Deboshree Dutta</username>< user>

I was not told about restocking fee.  It's $45 each phone, more than the cost of the phone itself.  This is robbery!  I did not sign any agreement.  It's wrong that I can't return merchandise if I am not happy w/ the product.<//review>

<text>Extremely unprofessional service.
Never been treated this way at any at & t store. Instead of explaining the problem and helping a way out for the questions we asked, the store manager just was plain rude.. and not helpful one bit. I don't typically leave comments but this kind of customer service is UNPROFESSSIONAL !!!! .
Customer service is simple - and management really needs to look into changing the culture in this branchm

Instead we walked out of the store and called another at & t outlet and within mins our concern was heard and the problem resolved. We will never come back to this store. I am thoroughly disgusted and sad our day had this kind of a blemish ! Get your act together !!!< /text><date>1537586068611<//date><Gmap_id>0x808fcda7ec751cdf:0x949e383db5dd15ce<//Gmap_id><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

We're from out of town but we had a good time at Partners. Drinks were a little weak but we're from Nevada so what do you expect. Friendly service, chill environment.<//review>

<Response>None</Response><text>This is a great place to hang out, play a few games of pool or join a pool league. Of course it's a bar and plenty of beer and mixed drinks to select from, but DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE!
They have a great choice of music and their juke box is so non-traditional. A good place to meet new people, but keep your guard up because all that go there may not have positive intentions. It's a bar where they try to keep the peace between all. Remember DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE!< /text>< date>

Ridgecrest is a weird place in terms of bars and credit cards. Most bars don't like them, or simply don't accept them (DJ's). Or they charge a lot more to use them.

I preferred Partners as a dinjy rundown dive. They classed it up a lot, very clean / modern feel. It is nice, no question. And the outdoor area is super cool, aside from the incessant cancer sticks burning.

If this joint were closer to me and had some TV / sports on, it'd be my go to joint. But it is way outta my way.<//Text>

They said one of my driver side control arm was possibly broken and needed to be replaced, Barry wanted to charge me $400. I look into videos and checked myself and their is nothing wrong with what they claimed. Neither side was broken
Barry is a scammer, do not trust him or his other employees.<//Text>

< review>
I had a fantastic experience today at Sears Auto Center in Clovis, CA this afternoon. The young man that helped me and discussed issues regarding my car was Ryan Lake. Super customer service and auto repair. Definitely hard to find these days and honesty regarding estimates, repairs, etc. I found Ryan to be quite meticulous in his questioning, and also multi-tasking with other customers coming in behind me. Such a calm and kind young man to everyone he spoke with and well mannered. I definitely recommend going here if you don't want to be taken to the cleaners. If you are an impatient person/customer, I would highly recommend making an appointment. I am grateful for my visit today and to Mr. Lake as well as the outstanding mechanic. Thanks again and look forward to my next oil-change.<//review>

<Review>I went in for an oil change but they held my car for 6 days because they broke parts. I had a  slow leak in my  oil pan that wasn't bothering me but they offered to fix it for $300. It's still leaking 6 months later. If you care about your time or money please avoid. Management told me to have a spare car for their shoty work.</Review>< user_name>

<review>Thanks Sears Auto Center, Clovis, for remaining open to the public.
I have used Sears Auto Centers for over 15 years.  This time was different, as an emergency arose when some heartless individual(s) went on a vandalism spree, slashing at 5 vehicle's tires in one night.  From the instant I spoke with RYAN LAKE at the Auto Center, the process of replacing my tires began to take a positive form.  Ryan was kind, understanding, let alone sympathetic, recognizing my distraught.  He worked diligently and thoroughly to assist in this financial situation.
It was necessary to meet him face-to-face to offer appreciation and many "thank you(s)" for his professionalism. This review is about Sears, the Auto Center Technicians, and Ryan.   Thank you, again.<//review>< Resp>

<Text>sears auto has the worst inexperienced workers ever.  They did not screw in my tire air tube and it left me stranded at a park.  All for tires flat.   Had to be towed home.  Leb swab said this was the simplest thing and most important process which they cannot understand why sear staff would forget to do since it was dangerous and could hurt kill me or someone.  Justin and crew excuse was oh ok bring it back.  Never.  Your team is lacking.  Bye bye ti your jobs which you cant do anyways.  You have been warned.  Justin and his crew are careless.< /Text></record>

My car got vandalized and I had to have all four tires replaced. I checked a few other places before coming here but I picked Sears because I was tired of looking at tires and they had what I needed in stock.

As far as service, they went above and beyond and made the whole ordeal a lot less stressful. Their staff is knowledgeable and efficient. They were the only ones to tell me that there was another manufacturer approved tire size for my car which made getting tires that day much easier. Their customer service is exceptional and I cannot recommend them enough.< /Text>

<text>I took my car here for years and loved the service. I'm not sure what happened to the service but the last time I went I was very unhappy. I had just had them put on new tires and check the brakes a couple weeks before but they said everything was fine. My brakes continued to make noise (but only going down hill or at high speeds) I needed my oil changed so I took it back for that and for them to take it out on the road so they could HEAR the noise instead of just looking at the BRAKE pads which they already told me LOOKED fine. At check in they tried to up sell me a coolent flush which I declined. When they called me for a update they said the car wasn't making any noises at all. After questioning if they actually drove it or just looked at it they said they drove it and it made no noise. (which is absolutely not true!) then said that my coolent was low and I needed a coolent flush. I asked why I would need a flush if it was just low and he couldn't explain just said it was what they recommended. So not only did they not drive it to hear the brakes they LIED about it and try to up sell the coolent flush again! NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!</text>< Pictures>

Came in at 8:30 on Saturday didnt leave till almost 12 with an Appointment.They never called to tell me the car was ready or even tell me it wouldnt be ready on time. I had to ask twice if it was ready. Needless to say wont be back. Also the old geezer Barry was very rude and disrespectful.</Review>

If anyone has had issues with batteries and warranty replacements you are not alone. They will wheel out their test station and either tell you your battery is fine, or to charge and retest. Don't waste your time with these guys. Even auto-zone can accurately and honestly test your battery. I took my battery under warranty there for two years, they told me it was fine, not until I demanded they stop using their current tester did they comply. Took them a day to test it. It was bad. Got my replacement battery just in time. Sad to say the replacement battery went out a year later. They are currently giving me the run around telling me to charge and retest when interstate and auto-zone, both got the same readings. They will not warranty the new battery, saying that the warranty is only on the original purchase. I wasted precious time believing their machine.< /Text>

<text>After reading some of the comments regarding this shop I was originally hesitant to come here. My experience couldnt have been better. Not only was my car finished faster than expected, Barry was one of the kindest and honest mechanics I have ever met!

I originally took my car to another shop and they told me that I had an alternator problem. I scheduled time to go into the Sears shop to have it fixed. Instead of just fixing the alternator and charging me $800, Barry helped diagnose the real and less expensive solution which cost me $135. In life you need honest doctors, dentists, and mechanics. I found some here!!! Barry and Mario were great!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1531596042586, 'text': 'We are always so grateful for feedback like this.

<Text>Had a great experience today at Sears Auto in Clovis, CA.  Yee, our mechanic, was terrific and very helpful explaining what was wrong with our car.  He took the time to show us instead of just telling us.  Mario and Jesse have always been so courteous and genuinely care about us and our repeat business.  They are friendly, kind, knowlegable, helpful, and great to deal with!  Thanks to all these men.<//Text></record>

Miguel is mildly helpful. Non committal, struggles through the details. Takes an over abundance of time to complete simple tasks. The other old guy with the gut hanging over his belt... How is this man on payroll? Useless human being. When he gets a free moment away from customers rather than help his associate who is obviously struggling he walks off into the nearest corner like golem huddling over his phone or "precious" come here y'all if you like waiting 20 min to be acknowledged before anyone even offers to help... It's no wonder sears has become what it is today. Next stop... the Mervyn's train ---> Out of business. Lol go where you can get meaningful help and spend your dollars where they buy service.

Cant beat an honest review and this experience today was an honest waste of over 25 min of my life. I'll never be back and I USED to come to sears with my 5 vehicles. America's Tire --->   where service is prompt and meaningful.</Text>

I started taking my car to Sears in 2010. They use to do such an amazing job. Over the years there service has deteriorated, and sadly I will no longer be a customer. I've had to take my car in for the same problem 3 times. Each time they assure me that they found the problem. The last time taking it in, I had to call to see the status of my car. I was on hold for over 5minutes, when someone finally picked up they still didn't know and had to place me on hold for another 5minutes. I've been in there once and watched while the phones rang and the employee stood there talking to another employee and refused to answer the phone. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.</Review>

<Text>First time customer, made an appointment due to the 2hour wait time.  So I figure yep let's do that. Next day I show up at my appointment on time. 2 hours later they page me that my car was done!! Two freaking hours with an appointment for a simple oil change!!

<Review>Horrendously slow service.

I have been a long-time customer of Sears automotive in several states and have had excellent service before moving to Clovis.  It was because of this past positive experience that I continued to take my car to the Clovis Sears

I have dealt with this particular Sears several times in the past year, and each time the service is ridiculously slow.  Unfortunately there is no advantage to making an appointment as walk-ins are given equal priority and quoted similar wait times.  Clearly they know how to take an appointment, they just don't know how to honor the appointments.

A customer should never have to wait in line for over 30 minutes before being waited on.  And it should never take 2 hours to simply change oil.  Overall 2:30 is a horrendously unreasonable amount of time to get oil changed.

It is safe to say that I have given them the benefit of the doubt long enough and will be doing my business elsewhere from now on.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80945b89b1a807b1:0xeba8d55c0a2157fe< /gmap_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_name>

After spending THOUSANDS of dollars on her vehicle over the years, I was just told by Barry that the 2 year warranty on the Alternator that we had purchased from Sears was not going to be honored because in their system, it didnt show that the alternator had been installed by them. They showed the purchase, along with the 2 Die Hard Gold batteries, they show the batteries being installed...just not the alternator. And then when I asked about them selling parts without installation, Barry told me that they MOST DEFINITELY DID NOT DO THAT!!!! So what gives...did they install my part (which they did), or did they sell it to me without installation??? Either way, I wasnt looking for anything other than to have my alternator replaced, and heck, I was even willing to change it out!!!! And as a GM of a MAJOR Auto Parts retailer myself, I am disgusted bu the way I was treated!!!!</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1513610396769, 'text': 'Thank you for your honest feedback.

I moved here from Boise. Idaho April 1, 2017 and before Idaho I lived in Phoenix, Arizona(husband in the United States Navy)
I bought an alternator for my 2005 F350 diesel truck from you guys almost 2 years ago and had you instal it. You guys installed the wrong one  the first time(an alt. For a dual alt. Set up which I do not have) and fried my batteries, FICM(Fuel Injection Control Module) and obviously the alternator. 1.5 years ago I brought the truck to your Boise, Idaho location when this happened(thats where the military moved us to). Boise location comped my batteries(since  I chose to pay for my FICM myself because I wanted an aftermarket one) and put the correct alternator in my truck. My alternator failed last week and stranded me with my 85 year old grandfather 300 miles from home. I called my local sears and the manager was a total jerk to me and would not honor the warranty even though he stated it was still valid. He stated he would not honor the warranty because the last sears didn't put notes in the account stating they installed it even though he has record of ALL of the purchases including that one. I called corporate and they assured me they would fight to get the alternator I had to buy so I could get home reimbursed and have the District Manager call me within 24-48 hours. This was 11/27. I've called 3 times now and been given the run around and still haven't been contacted my ANYONE. I have spent a lot of money with Sears over the years as my account will reflect and I would like to continue to do so however if this matter isn't resolved I will never step foot in Sears again.

<date>1621393255769< /date><Text>I was offered a couple of nights lodging at the UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center. When David, with the inside-scoop mentioned that it was 'Swank', I of course decided to give it a try. Google maps directed me into the loading dock at first, until I was able to discover the Guest Parking, located beneath the building,  accessible via a down-ramp that is adjacent to the guest drop-off / pick-up zone loop. The lobby is modern, warm, spacious with paneled details interspersed and appointed with gracious textures. The lobby has several work station areas available for guests. I was warmly greeted by the front desk staff, with comprehensive health safety protocols. The room was easily accessible from the security room-key enabled elevators. Echoing the modern motif, the room was tidy, with entry table, wardobe (with safe), integrated dresser, counter, desk & work chair, and large HDTV along the long wall, a comfortable reading chair, and king sized bed with side tables,  opposite. Numerous and well placed light fixtures facilitated getting comfortable. The bathroom is spacious with large lovely border-lit mirror and walk-in shower. The room was quite quiet :-) ...Thanks so very much for the ample hospitality and attention to detail...Thanks David, all of my 'Swank'  expectations have been exceeded!< /Text>< resp>

Due to covid there is no room service. You have to make your own bed everyday. Breakfast is great. Parking is onsite $32/ per day. If you are visiting UCLA this is the best option. Very convenient.</review>

Very good food topped up the stay. Being within UCLA campus was a great advantage. I understand that they don’t have service during the stay but they should have an automatic supply of coffee pods, towels etc... left at the doorsteps every night.</text>

Such a fun experience at the California Academy of Sciences! Went with my family and we all enjoyed ourselves. Plenty of exhibits there, we especially liked the Philippine Coral Reef and the earthquake simulator. The staff there was so friendly too! Would definitely want to make a trip back to San Francisco to see everything over again!<//Text>

<text>It’s like staying in a museum. So many art. The lobby was exceptionally spacious, well decorated and clean. The overall ambiance was really nice. Staff were very professional, nice and helpful. The onsite restaurant served amazing meals. I will definitely go back and I can’t wait to stay at this hotel again.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
We went here yesterday for our son's eleventh birthday. The exhibits are truly amazing. The rainforest dome, the albino aligator and the penguins were my favorites, not to mention the gorgeous 'Living Roof.' The food in the cafeteria is a bit pricey, but tastes incredible. My artichoke and wheatberry salad was excellent. The entire staff is also super friendly and eager to answer any questions you may have about the exhibits. My only complaint would have to be the fact that this place is expensive as heck. After the cost of admission and a meal at the cafeteria, a family of four can easily spend over three hundred bucks. All in all though, a great experience...just expect to be charged an arm and a leg.<//Review>

<review>I used to love grabbing a drink at this bar and business meetings were easy to coordinate. After a lengthy remodel it's lost a bit of the flair from before. The seating feels a bit cafeteria like and the coziness is gone. The menu is still nice and the staff pleasant.< /review>< pictures>

Elegant grounds and rooms, friendly staff, and a fantastic pool area. The courtyard is a perfect area for hanging out, enjoying the weather, and leisure. If you have kids, the separated bunk bed option is very cool.< /text>

Stayed five nights for Anime Expo. I relished the hotel experience. The check in staff are very nice and willing to lend you a black umbrella upon request which I used to try to stay cooler in the record breaking heat. The rooms felt well kept up and housekeeping refreshed the rooms wonderfully every night. I caught the turn down service the first night and got champagne gummy bears!< /text>

Brandly new and very nice Conference Center. Went there for a two-hour lecture. We were told that the hotel has 250 rooms. Huge. Lobby is classical. Staff are very friendly. But just never sent the IT person that we need indeed. 😂< /review>

This was a beautiful conference center and hotel. The rooms were lovely, even having bathrobes.

The conference services for the conference I attended were amazing as well. I'm assuming the center was responsible for the catering and refreshments, but whoever did it provided a great selection and plenty of it.<//text>

I didn't actually stay overnight here because the prices were outrageous. But it is a clean and beautiful place. The conference area is very nice. Nice place to attend conferences or meetings< /text>

Please do  know that depending upon season, our rates do fluctuate and we have specials and promotions most of the year.

Great place to stay. The staff was really nice and is in a great location. You stay right next to a bunch of cool buildings.also it is a short walk to westwood. In the third floor, there is a terrace where you have a great view of the campus and you can see the football team practicing. The room was fine but you don't spend do much time at the room.</text>

Because I was told that tuition also goes toward Luskin, we are very confused.  Is this a posted policy?

Every staffer we encountered -- from restaurant servers to front desk workers to housekeeping personnel -- were friendly, helpful and accommodating.

Plateia has one of my favorite sandwiches of all time: the chicken bacon avocado sandwich. The bread is toasted to perfection, the juicy chicken is marinated with delicious herbs, the avocado is smashed with lemon to brighten it up and the bacon adds a lovely crunch. Can’t go wrong with the tricolore side salad or the crispy Parmesan fries either.< /Review>

<Review>Stayed as an overnight guest in the ADA accessible room. The bathroom was great. The shower was super easy to get in and out of and the tile did not get super slick when wet. The toilet and counter was at a reasonable height. The bed was a tad on the high side, but it was rather comfortable. I just wish the pillows were slightly flatter but that is personal preference. Overall, I would definitely stay here again.<//Review>< pics>

We were there for 2 nights in May 2019. The entire facility, inside and outside, is beautiful, including our room. Tastefully decorated and relaxing. The food in the restaurant, Plateia was delicious, including the room service we ordered. Any staff that we encountered, from the front desk associates to the cleaning personnel were so pleasant and helpful. We needed to order something for our room and it was delivered with minutes.  I highly encourage anyone considering staying here to do so. We really enjoyed our stay.<//text>

<text>The room size is VERY hit and miss. You can reserve a double queen size room and sometimes you get a nice comfortable room. Other times, you get a shoe box. I am writing this review from a shoe box right now and am not happy. I can't even fit my suitcase in the closet and had to move the coffee service table to make room for it, as we have two large suitcases with very little space to put them. Unfortunately, the bathroom floor in our room also had LONG BLACK HAIR ALL OVER IT and other junk.

On the website, there are several price options based on your affiliation to the university. One of the options, the most expensive one, is for people like me - no connection. My family and I are just visiting and booked one room for one night. I arrived at the front desk to check in and was told that I will stay in a certain room. I mentioned that I booked a room with two beds. The employee replied that the room I booked is not available because they are overbooked. I made a comment like, “I have a child and we would really appreciate a room with two beds.” He didn’t really care and said there is nothing he can do. He offered to pay for a room at a different hotel. I explained that we have a baby that needs to sleep solos and it would be difficult to start searching for a hotel at this hour. I asked to speak with a manager and he replied, “I am the manager.” “I don’t know how the system works, but what is the point of booking a room if it cannot be guaranteed and if people overbook?” He was definitely upset by my question. He asked what brings us in the area and I said we are visiting the area. To which he replied, “You do not qualify to stay in our hotel because you have to come here specifically to visit UCLA.” Technically, I should have said that I came to visit the UCLA campus and it would have been okay. The true reason though, I asked too many questions and he didn’t like it. Luckily we found a nice hotel within a mile, at a lower rate. UCLA has a great reputation but the first impression is definitely not great.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc8602a90341:0xd73874d4f138751a<//Gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp>< rate>

< review>
Finally had the chance to enter the elusive hotel of Gene Block because of a banquet.

Venue was very nice, super modern and well designed. Definitely felt like a very high class place. Our banquet was in one of the conference rooms and everything was very nice -- set tables and catering.

Food was pretty good! Was surprised by how the catering was decent. Had fish, roasted vegetables, chicken, soup, and a variety of desserts. Honestly, wanted seconds but I was too full after one plate.

Anyway, very nice venue and would recommend for event planning.</review>

< review>
Really upscale and nice place!! Lots of amenities for guests and the staff is all super nice (and there is a no tipping policy throughout the hotel including valet, restaurant, and bar). My only complaint was that there is a charge if you'd like a mini fridge and I did not find this out until checkout. You'd think a place this nice would offer one for free, but even if they're going to charge, I wish they made it more clear. Other than that, a truly wonderful stay! A legendary property that I would absolutely return to.</review>

Beautiful and contemporary space. Wait staff are friendly and fast. Food was delicious and not the "same old continental breakfast/pastry spread," but a full hot breakfast meal. Coffee stayed hot and fun, and there was an ample variety of hot teas.</review>

My daughter was having surgery at the Ronald Reagan Medical Center and I could not recommend this place more.  They were so amazing and efficient and kind.   I was tapped out emotionally due to my daughter's medical issues and I was a complete basket case.  I was a ball of nerves and tears.  I needed food and I needed sleep.  I was just a mess, and they were so kind and accommodating.   Truly amazing.   Further, this was just a quick 7 minute walk to the hospital.  It was convenient and perfect for our needs.<//Text>

It was definitely nice when we got inside and we waited patiently to be checked in to finally get into our rooms. But we had to wait a bit due to the front desk attendant having to deal with a situation and being the only one at the desk. Than my boyfriend was not appearing on the system so we had to deal with that situation too. It was stressful, but once we got it sorted out and into our assigned rooms, it was an enjoyable experience with the facilities.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

This hotel is nice, clean, and well run. Rooms are immaculate and facilities are nice. There's a restaurant attached to it, with reasonably priced food. The elevator was hard to figure out for many guests. You have to hold your key card on a sensor below the floor numbers and wait for the light to turn green. Only then can you select your desired floor level. I wish this was communicated better at check in. All of the guests that we encountered had trouble figuring out that this was how the elevator worked. hotel is on the pricey side, but  I'd gladly stay again if I have to.< /text>

Hotel is nice, beds were very comfortable, but we usually just stay at UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center and not the regency and you get soo much more not here.

Great place to stay, very close to the hospital which was the purpose behind the trip. Certainly the best for walking distance purposes. Needed to extend my stay and had no issues doing so.<//review>

A great place but bring your own Starbucks Keurig cups because the coffee they have in the room is pretty nasty. There is no pool. The restaurant is good and the rooms are very nice. It's very well located relative to campus and the Ronald Reagan Medical Center.< /text>

<review>I stayed there for an academic conference, and the clear consensus at the conference is that this is the most pleasant University hotel any of us had seen.

Highlights: Solidly good, moderately priced New American food in the lobby; art everywhere, some of which is almost genuinely interesting; lots of sustainability-oriented details; beautiful front patio; walkable to pretty much all of campus.<//review>< userid>

Unfortunately, during my visit to UCLA my family and I suffered a devastating and sudden loss of a young beloved family member who was a UCLA Alumni.  As I sobbed to explain my needs, the staff went above and beyond to assist me and my family.  They were genuine and kind and I even received hugs to help me get through the moment.  Words can’t express my gratitude to the wonderful and kind staff of this amazing hotel.< /review></record>

Really nice rooms. And that's about  it. Rude staff, especially in the breakfast-area, many strange rules for the guests, no communication between different departments in the hotel = lots of misunderstandings, and last but not least- check your credit card now and then , since they tend  to charge you for others purchases.  Not a happy guest.<//text>

THE PARKING WAS FREE. WE REQUEST A CREDIT WE WERE TERRIBLE UNCOMFORTABLY.  sEND THIS TO THE ADMINISTION. My
