In went to smart style after having a not so good experience somewhere else.  Bobby was the one i wanted to cut my hair  due to she is very nice and in my opinion cuts hair like a pro.  I had been so unhappy with my last hair cut . She did a great job and I believe she is able to cut any hair style you like.  The place was clean and well kept.  The other employees were there to help.  Thank you bobby for just being you. Lisa<//Text>

So the first time I brought my son here was great, but I just took him again a few minutes ago and I got home and he had cuts behind both ears. I understand mistakes happen, he's a squirmy 4 year old, but they should have at least let me know. Unfortunately I will not be coming back.<//text>

I left in a bad mood after my hair appointment. I came in for an all over color; the color was correct but the service wasn't good. There were globs of color down my neck, ears, forhead etc. She didn't even do anything until I pointed it out, but it had stayed on so long that it already oxidized. Eventually I had to keep scrubbing it at the salon, and still it wouldn't come off. After the shampooing comes the style, but she just threw a little gel in that made my hair feel like garbage and gave a little blow dry. No style. Nothing. Dripping wet frizzy hair. My hair is to my chin but I paid extra because it's thick, I don't mind, but with the extra money, I expected a little extra care... I left disappointed...< /Text>

Amanda is simply amazing! I haven't had my hair professionally colored before so I had certain reservations.  Amanda not only listened, but took my idea to the next level!!! I was so excited about how good the color AND cut were, I had goosebumps!!! I am wonderfully stunned, thank you so much!< /review>

< review>
they honestly don't even deserve a star. My mom went to get some highlights in her hair, something simple. She showed the girl cutting her hair what she wanted and the girl said "ok, no problem I can do that". My mom became suspicious when a person standing next to her asked the girl what she was doing to her hair. She answered with "a rainbow" and laughed. To my moms disappointment and THIS REVIEW as well, once her hair was blow-dried she noticed something had went COMPLETELY WRONG. My mom's hair was literally YELLOW. We don't know what that girl was thinking! All in all, she had to paint my mom's hair AGAIN because it was so AWFUL, which damaged her hair insanely. In the end, the brown that was supposed to cover up the yellow made her hair a burnt ORANGE. We will NEVER be going back to Walmart Hair Salon. If you still make the choice to go even after this review, watch whom ever is styling your hair VERY CLOSELY, and if something doesn't seem right, ASK THEM WHAT THEY ARE DOING....</review>

<text>I went here and the lady (Jennifer) didn't seem to know what she was doing. My hair didn't come out at all how I wanted & still had to pay $65. For a messed up all over hair color.

They are great ! I now have a stylist I intend to request everytime for both my son's hair . I also find the staff far friendlier and more professional  than the old place I went to . You can tell they genuinely enjoy their job and the conversations arent forced which is very nice. The most important part for me they work well with kids and really want to make you happy and make an effort I strongly recommend this place .< /Review>

To be honest, I will send the highest ranking and strong positive reviews to the restaurant that I was last night. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic. All the staff know just what effective customer service is. They knew what they were doing and they were doing it professionally. I don't have much to say about their daily functioning. Thank you very much.<//Review>

I went to this restaurant for my birthday, and my experience was pretty good! The dishes are small and expensive, but they still taste great. Also be aware of the registration fee which is 20% of the total bill. The interior is trendy, yet cozy. I loved their dishes and how they change my utensils every time I get new dish.< /Review>

Crew is friendly and accommodating during these weird Covid times. Applause for them.
And the space will create some serious eyeball gluttony. It's beautiful. Every inch gorgeously thought out.
Well done, well done.</text>

I was just at this place. I've been wanting to try it out since they opened and my mom and I walked by and saw that Stacks of firewood outside. Us being from Latin countries, we knew that when a place has stacks of firewood outside, tl;dr, "There's the good sh!t"

So I ordered a slice.

It was 'Amazing'.

If you need any other adjective to describe a pizza, please move along.

The crust was perfect, the small spheres of pepperoni delight were resplendent and exquisite. And the cheese. OMG, the cheese, not only did it savor like genuine alchemical dairy, it oozed off the edges on particular parts of the slice to give that genuine pizza experience.

This only makes me wonder; they put so much quality into a 'single' slice, I wonder what else their menu tastes like.<//review>

Been loving their to-go ice cream pints during Covid :) Flavors change on the daily- the seasonal fruit flavors are the best- very subtle flavors, not too sweet and super creamy.</Review>

Just spent the weekend in Chicago and had Giordano's deep dish in Oak Park,  It was just fine, but does not hold a shred of parmesan toAntico.  I am a Zachary's(East Bay hot spot) fan, but now I have a new favorite, Antico.  It's a great date or group spot too.  The service is excellent.   Our salad was delicious and fresh as well.  Cannot wait for our next visit.  Suggest dinner at Little Star Pizza, entertainment at The Independent and dessert at Candy Bar on Fulton.  Yes to a night in NOPA!</Review>

The ice cream is another level. Should you come just for the ice cream? Yes, immediately. The restaurant is good too but if all they sold was ice cream I wouldn't be upset.< /review>

<Review>So I went to pickup ice creams at the restaurant this time, since DoorDash doesn’t have their latest selections 😋 @antico___la did it again! They have quickly become my favorite ice cream maker in LA. The Chocolate Hazelnut is my fav of all ice cream I’ve ever had.  Those candied (toffee, maybe?) hazelnut chucks ... omg 🥰
The cookies & cream was a close second.
& I love their seasonal plum flavor too.
Still got more flavor to try but..Seriously, this is top of my list.
__________
Ordered DoorDash for their seasonal Plum ice cream! Sooo good. So plummy!
I have had dinner there before the COVID time and this place was a gem! I can’t wait til I can order their pasta dishes again!< /Review>< pics>

Important note make sure you leave some room for the ice cream (I had the honey comb amazing). Difficult to find street parking but there is valet. Was able to get same day reservations. I would highly recommend trying it out but keep in mind the portions are on the larger side so sharing is a must. I'll add pictures next time I go back.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b9403e6a4807:0x268983050babaf42<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Just incredible. The energy. Lighting. Vibe. Food. Team. Wine. Yes to all of it. Chef Chad and the team are doing something really special here. There are zones and dimensions of flavor within the sauces...something mysterious is happening in this food. It will require several visits back to get to the bottom of it.< /text>

<Text>Wow, where do I begin? Every element about this spot is spot on - from the ambiance, the service, food, and especially the decor. Chef Chad - you really outdid yourself. Thanks for the hospitality. You all really made the evening extra special. Congratulations on the new restaurant.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

One of my favorite parts of living in LA is strip mall culture. Antico brings simple, elegant, rustic Italian fare. Simple but eccentric and interesting pasta options. Wood fired grill produces lots of lovely flavors. And a great wine list with very interesting, modestly priced bottles. Love it. Happy it’s in my hood< /Review>

Food itself was well prepared. Antipasto was a bad joke. Room is an open kitchen and pleasant but noise level was outrageous. There are many better Italian dining choices.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< user_id>

< Review>
Came here for date night since we live a couple of blocks away and one of the servers is an acquaintance of my BF, so we decided to check it out. The decor is clean and very homey, having been in Italy just a few weeks prior, the ambiance definitely reminded me of my trip. They have a great wine selection and with the two of us being new to the wine game, the Somme gave us a great recommendation based on our preferences.

Everything on that menu looked so good; but we settled on the Antico steak and the cappelini al limone, and we weren’t disappointed. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the two pieces of anchovy on top complemented the citrus flavor of the sauce very well. The steak was tender and very well seasoned on its own, but the accompanying salsa verde took it to another level.

DO NOT SKIP OUT ON THE HONEYCOMB ICE CREAM!! One of the best ice creams I’ve had. They add a little bit of salt and olive oil, and somehow that makes it even better.

The staff were all great and very accommodating. I really appreciated that they didn’t come up during every course and asked if everything was ok while I was busy stuffing my face with tasty food. I think the clean and empty plates coming back to the kitchen spoke for us.<//Review>

<text>Stopped in for a minor life celebration with my partner, we grabbed the final reservation for the evening at 9:30pm.

Immediately, we were hit with the beautiful decor and excellent service. Ambience was on point as we were seated, though it became immediately obvious that my partner and I would not be having an intimate evening as we could barely hear anything we said to one another. Atmosphere was cozy with long tables for larger parties and tables off to the sides for parties of 2-4. It was very nice to be able to look into the kitchen and see our chefs hard at work.

The wine list is extensive and we shared 2 glasses of champagne which was delightful and complimented our meal well. Someone with more of a sommelier’s

We decided to split the “Burrata” as our opener which was a delightful breakdown of a typical caprese salad. We followed up with the “Ziti” for myself and the “Maccheroni” for my partner, along with some bread. Both dishes were excellent, unique flavor pairings and depth you rarely find outside of a white tablecloth type restaurant. We both found ourselves unimpressed with the pasta, however. It is not bad, but didn’t taste as fresh as, say, Pasta Sisters. The bread was excellent, crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside and perfectly salted. Finally, we did get some ice cream which was, by far, our favorite part of the meal. Fresh and ultra creamy, it was beyond exquisite.

At the end of the night I still had leftovers and our server got me some more bread to have with my pasta which was such a nice touch. Overall, we both had a wonderful evening with excellent service but for the price, the pasta was only good, not great, and we can find great pasta in so many places. Happy this place exists and I hope we may come back once it’s found surer footing!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I love across from your School play yard and enjoy hearing the students! Your Eucharistic Ministers come by hear on Thursdays so I can join them in Prayers and recieve Holy Communion! I have some continuing health issues but there is always some who has it worse! We all have our Cross to carry! But God never gives us more than we can carry! St
Leander Church and Parrish are a Blessing!<//Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>I've been going to St Leanders Church for 4 years since I moved to San Leandro and I have to say this is one of the best churches I've attended. There are a few turn overs on Priest but they are all friendly with the people. The people in the church are not going to give dirty looks if you don't do anything to them they are kind if you are kind bottom line is I've never had an issue with the people who attend the mass or with the Priest. There is a huge plus in that church and that is their choir they are great.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808f8f914f5344a5:0x23fa8bc3d5b6383e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They have the rudest selfish ppl at the office, they shouldn't have ppl working with that attitude specially at church where it should be a place of peace. They should have humble, happy and nice ppl..open to help the community.< /Text>

Praise God for this awesome church! People are friendly and welcome. Plenty of opportunities to serve our Lord. May God fulfill this place with much more blessings and surround it with His grace. Many people people in the neighborhood need Christ, and church does a great job with its outreach ministries. Praise God!!!< /Text>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>They were not very accommodating, for those who did not speak they native language, though a member was asked to interpret for me in English, so that I could understand and enjoy the service that member refused to interpret in English for me, so I could understand and enjoy the service. Well I guess they only want to keep the services exclusively for themselves, and I'm sure there wishes will come true.  Well I will not be returning nor will I recommend it to others.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I ❤️ everyone who works here. Wonderful deli items. Fresh home-made items.
They sell beverages that I can't find elsewhere.
Big fan or the cannoli & the Rocco sandwich.
Wish they'd actually carry an Italian Marscipone & fresh bread & I wouldn't need to shop elsewhere.</text>

Their sandwiches are hands down the best ive ever had, and I'm not a sandwich guy. They made me understand the art of a great sandwich. Also, I never liked cannolis until I had Rocco's.

If you blink you'll probably miss this place but that'll be on you because they have well crafted sandwiches. Also, their market has all the staples that suppose to be on the shelves of any Italian market 👌</Text>

Just went with their recommendation and tried the Prosciutto Cotto. It was sooooo good. The flavor, the bread, the meat, the cheese, everything about it was great. And the staff was super nice and they were being good about Covid. Highly recommend it.<//text>

You definitely will not leave this place hungry. One sandwich really is enough to feed two people, or even better... lunch and dinner!  Comes with a side of potato salad which is also very good. The only downsides to this place is that it is not near my home or work and also the parking. We had to park around the corner and feed a meter.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

EightyTwo is not bad if you are looking to grab a drink and play some retro games. If you are looking for much more, EightyTwo doesnt have a whole lot more to offer. I personally like EightyTwo's concept and goal, and I truly wish the best for the ownership. But I did not thoroughly enjoy EightyTwo because I dont think I am the type of person for this type of bar/event space. Plenty of my friends like it though, so they are definitely appealing to a significant audience.< /Text>

<username>Ronda Rousey</username><text>Food is delicious!  They were out of pastrami, and one of the soups, so we changed our order. Then they were out of rolls.  Ended up with a great Rueben on rye and an Italian sub. Best potato salad and coleslaw ever! They are very,  very slow. It took about 30 minutes to get our sandwiches.  There were only two other people  in the restaurant,  but he was training a new guy.  Worth the trip,  just call in the order!< /text><GmapID>0x80c2c0ae9458338f:0xcdb6c630cc9f31b8</GmapID><resp>None< /resp>< time>

<review>Old world Italian. Great food and ambiance. The family owned shop with great traditional eats will take you back to Italy even if it’s just for a few minutes. Take a break from the hustle and bustle you will be swept away.<//review>< pictures>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Thr first time I visited Rocco's,  I had the porchetta "American style" with the melted provolone but they said I could customise to my liking. On my next visit, I had the porchetta served Italian style, with just the pork (no cheese) on their home-made bread. Made me nostalgic. They also have a small selection of Italian candies and chocolates. This place is worth a visit and is ranked in the top 10 best sandwhich places in L.A.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The food is authentic and delicious, especially their porchetta sandwich...seriously, get the porchetta. The staff is always friendly and very sweet, usually asking about your day and wishing you well. The deli itself is long and fairly small, but still with plenty of places to sit indoors and outdoors where you can perch under gentle Italian arches and watch people walk up and down Vermont Ave.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><name>Michael Shilstone</name>< userid>

I'm not a meat-eater, but upon sampling the sandwiches at this deli, I was given an amazing cheese sandwich.  Bread is baked to perfection and all the sauces and pickled veggies made for an extra zesty and delightful experience.< /review>

< Review>
I have spent many nights camping here, over the years. They have done a lot to make improvements to the site and foot trails that will lead you to the beach. This is a great place for a car camping, on a holiday weekend this place will be very packed so make sure you make reservations ahead of time.<//Review>

<Review>My family has stayed at this camp ground for over 30 years. We love it and it has a great access trail to the ocean and places to fish with in a short walking distance. Check out some of these photos of our many experiences while staying at Green Acres.</Review>< pictures>

Amazing place by the beach!  Path to the ocean is great. Very family friendly place. Only reason I give it 3 stars is for the bathrooms and showers. No soap or toilet seat covers in bathrooms and showers were little cement rooms where everything kinda gets wet(great water pressure)< /text>

It is not kept up like it used to be. We have made reservations 2 years in a row and when we got there the office was locked up and they didn't have any info on us. This year the awning over the pinic tables were so unstable we didn't dare sit under it. We also had full hook ups and the lights to the table didn't work. The grass needed mowed and we are sad to see it go down hill it used to be really nice.</Text>

I had a lot of fun riding my bike around on the trails on the beach. Too bad they put up a sign, no bike riding in the park. Thanks for keeping my mail safe after I moved out.

Ok they don't answer phone calls. They will not call you back so don't leave a message. Some of the permanent ppl are a-holes. They aren't in the office most of the time & you have a few dirtbags that stay there at times. Wknds/holidays suck in summer But it's a great place to stay if you go on off times. Dogs, kids are welcome, showers, crappers are great. Beach is close and cool. It's my go to place for 27yrs. Fishing and diving is real good.< /Text>

I lived here for 4months. It gets very cold. You can hear the ocean at night crashing on the rocks which is a short walk away. The winter months are cold so all i heard for a week was a chainsaw. The management cut down tree limbs inside of park for firewood. The night sky is very dark. You can see big stars. Quiet place. Lots of shade which causes mold to grow on your rv. Only complaint is the management took 2months to clear space for rv spot. I was upset. All they had to do is throw wood in the trash. So the rent is 500$ full hook up with yard. But i think there's ufo's activity out here. Beware.</text>

<Review>One of my favorite spot in Westlake. Great service & hospitality. Every time I've picked up my order, I have noticed the sushi chef is always in a cheerful spirit which is very welcoming. Highly recommend Sushi Ai. They also have a buy 2 get 1 free that's a awesome deal.<//Review>< Pics>

The Best Sushi in the area between Westlake and Calabasas! Happy hour everyday all day prices on lots of rolls, beers, apps! Amazingly fresh and rolls aren't tiny, they are prepared beautifully and to fulfill. Must hit Sushi AI. Pictured is the Mexican Roll.<//text>

<Text>Great Sushi, and as a bonus, Ramen and Udon were good too.  They also have a few innovative rows in addition to the typical.  W loved the Basil row.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZqGEj9RCJ8YtZVt1g9NdKRiQ31tZMDo638c6J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

<review>New chef James.  Served us exquisite sushi. Fantastic. Some of the best we have ever had.  The B rating does not do them justice.  They deserve an A++.  They call him James Bond and he deserves the praise. We were very impressed.  And will be back for more.  Highly recommend.< /review><Date>1535676319068< /Date><user>117559679504210007887</user>< name>

<review>Good prices on happy hour. You have to really make an issue of happy hour menu otherwise they don't want to give it to you. Good that they stay open later than other nearby restaurants
There is definitely a cultural problem here.  Very limited English and do not understand American thinking at all.
There is one American Server on weekends that understands better said he would try to explain to them.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80e8244193f34e05:0xe83ff0a5f54bffbe<//GmapID></record>

Without a doubt, the best sushi around. JB (the head sushi chef) is nothing short of a master at his craft. He always has amazing recommendations and I can say for certain that whatever he advises will be the best sushi you've had. He'll make us custom rolls that he invents on the spot and they never disappoint. We come here weekly.<//text>

<Text>They have a happy hour special late at night. The beers and sake bombs are a dollar each as long as you order about $5 worth of food. Sushi was fine and the beer was good and cheap. Not a place for excellent food but it's fairly cheap and still tasty.< /Text><GmapID>0x80e8244193f34e05:0xe83ff0a5f54bffbe</GmapID>< user>

<review>I've eaten here during my lunch break 3xs now and Im obsessed with the super volcano roll.  I love spicy food and this roll offers just enough spice to keep me coming back for more.  it's a baked a roll with crab, salmon and more for only $13. the customer service here is pretty good, no wait, lots of seating and there's ample parking. try it out, you won't be disappointed.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80e8244193f34e05:0xe83ff0a5f54bffbe</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a chicken veggie bowl with white rice avocado and green onions. Was charged $1.99 for the smallest cup of onions I've ever seen. Don't let them rip you off like they did me. Also they barely gave me any veggies. Pretty much all rice.</review>

<Text>This is the best Waba I’ve had. There are several locations. Each with various levels of customer service and food quality. It would be 5 stars if this location had consistently good service and food. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case. A majority of the time the food is great. I recommend the half and half chicken and steak bowl or the chicken and veggie bowl. The Waba sauce is in point 👌🏻<//Text><gmap_id>0x80db512dc6b270f1:0x344eb3e5d6ab5d62< /gmap_id><user_id>105452532702630011382< /user_id><date>1540687063962< /date></record>

<Text>Excellent food. Very friendly staff. Sanitizer available. You can either order at the counter for pickup or have it delivered by multiple different apps. The food quality is always delicious & fresh, but it can be a little pricey for something you can get cheaper elsewhere. I highly recommend the steak and veggie bowl. I don't think that steak at other rice bowl places is nearly as good. (Sorry Flame Broiler)</Text><Gmap_id>0x80db512dc6b270f1:0x344eb3e5d6ab5d62<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Came by on Veterans Day. I checked the website first, which said they were open until 9pm for the holiday. Got here to find a misspelled sign saying they closed at 5pm. If you're going to have a website, it should be accurate. That, plus the B grade from the health department, makes it unlikely that I'll be back anytime soon.<//Text>

<username>Elizabeth Rojas< /username><date>1558482542702</date><Rate>1</Rate><text>My family and I went to WaBa grill and ordered three bowls, all with brown rice and one with no chicken do to dietary limitations. When we came home with the food, all the bowls had white rice and the bowl that shouldn't of had chicken had chicken. My mom called the restaurant and Scott picked up (he was also the one who took their orders), my mom told him what had happened very calm at first and the first thing he said is that she was lying. He would not let her talk, he accused her of just wanting free food. When my mom asked for the manger he said he was the manager. After a minute I called back to see if I could get anywhere with the situation. Scott picked up and when I told him who I was, the first thing he did was put me on hold very rudely, when I talked to him very calmly just to see who else I could talk to he wouldn't give me any information. Before the phone called ended he did also tell me my mom was a liar! I have honestly never ever wrote a review before, but the way my family was treated was completely unacceptable. As a person who works hands on with people, I would never EVER make anyone feel the way my family felt today!< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I love the food. Fresh cabbage and carrots cooked with care. No soggy taste. No bad flavors.  We prefer the teriyaki chicken instead of the steak. The teriyaki steak costs more but tastes strange. The miso soup is also very tasty.  But I add a packet of soy sauce for extra flavor.<//review>

< Review>
I always order a tofu veggie bowl and I don't know what it is but this location doesn't know how to prepare tofu or something because each time I've went it just wasn't very good. This last time I went their rice was super mushy. The Loma Linda location is much better and even the Colton location is better. Kinda a bummer since I live in Yucaipa, but I won't be giving them another try.< /Review>

I visit this place a lot since I work right next to it. I like how their customer service is always great and they keep the spot well organized all the time. Prices are fair and they serve generous portions.</review>

<Review>We have eaten at this establishment for years now. It has change ownerships but the current owner and chef are excellent. I highly recommend this establishment for breakfast and lunch. Very reasonable price and they do have Menudo Saturday and Sunday. The service is great very nice very friendly atmosphere. The only problem to this restaurant is the parking lot. The owner of the building need to fix the asphalt.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Doesnt look like much from the outside but the inside is another story, it's a nicely kept diner with pretty awesome food and a spacious eating area,. I stumbled on it by dumb luck and have been going back ever since,. Only down side is they dont serve any beer but with omelets an burger as good as theirs, I think I can look past it lol<//Text>

<text>If you like really good Menudo or Pozole go on the weekends!  Friendly service and great prices too!  If a burger fan...ask for the "San Francisco burger" .... absolutely delicious!

<review>One of my favorite wineries 🍾 here in Temecula wine country.  Every aspect of the winery 🍷 has been carefully maintained from the manicured vines 🍇 and landscape to the award winning wines. 🥂 Not to be missed 🍻<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtLhLBiZNruW3p--W7ATNCx2_zU7v6KFT416OA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOOIEd1qEoDdaaAALeMQ8qhN_y4xLYYq6pRBDv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80db79a620a8c643:0x11c0be84a116c72a< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Beautiful place.  Lots of open outdoor spots to sit and social distance.  Service was wonderful and very helpful.  The seemed knowledgeable enough about the selection to make recommendations based on our stated preferences.  Ambiance was inviting with misters running on a warm day and jazz playing in the background.  Could easily spend the day here.<//review>< Pics>

There was a wedding in session so we sat in the rear backside of the winery. The scenery was beautiful, the lite breeze was pleasant, and the wine was fantastic. Very worth checking out. You can picnic, bring your own food and drink or purchase.</text>

Little lake view is zen to drink and spend time with good company. ❤ Froze was perfect for this 110 degree weather in Temecula. If you love wine follow @winelov3r on Instagram.</Text>

Vitagliano is primarily a wedding/event venue and their grounds are absolutely beautiful. We were in the mood for a dry white and were offered a taste of their cabernet rosé and Moscato. I don’t like sweet wines and was pleasantly surprised that the Moscato was quite good – crisp, dry and very fruity. It was hard to choose, but we opted for a bottle of the rosé. I appreciated that they automatically gave us an ice bucket to keep it chilled. I had read that you can preorder charcuterie, sandwiches, salads, desserts. We didn’t order ahead, but I asked and they happened to have a few small charcuterie plates available. Their food is provided locally through E.A.T. Marketplace. The charcuterie was very small for the price and the few strawberries in it were mushy and a bit moldy underneath!

I think the charcuterie containers had been around for a day or two, so perhaps if we had preordered, the food would have been better/fresher. So the food was a bit of a disappointment and I’m not wild about having to preorder 24 hours in advance since we tend to stop in to wineries as the mood strikes us. But on the upside, the rosé was refreshing and we enjoyed sitting by the pond and wandering the grounds a bit. We’d definitely return – the grounds are truly magical and this is the perfect setting for relaxing with a good bottle of wine.</Text>< pictures>

The wine tasting has only been open 1/3 of the times I went but they still sell wine and food after and they are both so good. I love to buy a bottle for my friends to share and we never regret it. It's so delicious. This is my favorite winery in Temecula. It's so pretty!!!< /review>

Very cute little place. A bit of a surprise that it was so nice since it's a smaller place and doesn't have as large a footing as some of the other vineyards bit we really enjoyed the setting and some tasty wines there. Would absolutely return.<//Text>

Little lake view is zen to drink and spend time with good company. ❤ Froze was perfect for this 110 degree weather in Temecula. If you love wine follow @winelov3r on Instagram.< /Text>

Really beautiful winery with pleasant staff. I love when a find a place with friendly and welcoming staff and that in itself earned than a good review, but to top it off the grounds are beautiful. It was the perfect place to stop and relax on the weekend. Also their wines were delicious. Highly recommend the Dolce Rosa.<//review>

The grounds are absolutely beautiful and the Tuscan architecture will make you feel like you have entered a European country. They welcome visitors to view their grounds even if you do not stay for food or wine. They have a Sunday Brunch, and Tacos on Saturdays. During Covid it is best to call first regarding food offered that day, and reservations are required for lunch and dinner at this time. They also host special events such as weddings. Cabernet Sauvignon anyone?< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3kExkxQSzfILCNIkFizFn9VCsNMvJ80W6BNdC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>I'm giving this place a 5 star based on the venue itself. Beautiful grounds and a perfect place to lounge around with friends. There were only a few people there so it felt like we had the place to ourseleves. It is still under construction but looks like it is almost complete. They were laying pavers while we were there. Highly recommend for events.

We brought our own food and drink so i didn't try anything from the vineyard but other people seemed to enjoy the wine.< /text><resp>{'time': 1515353086103, 'text': "That's wonderful Brett!

Got to the winery near the close on Wednesday, which was also movie night. The staff were clearly preparing to clean up but accommodated us without making us feel like they were doing us a favor. Very friendly and knowledgeable about their wines. Grounds are beautiful. Absolutely worth a visit. They don't have many wines available at this time, but that means you get to taste their entire portfolio. Also, some of their wines are aged, so you're not tasting tight, recently bottled reds, for example.<//Text>

Tons of kids running around. Plus the staff asks you questions but never listens to you and treats you like you’ve never heard of grapes. Primativo was really good. Thus ANY stars at all.< /review>

The wine wasn't that great, certainly not worth $18 for the tasting. The grounds were very nice so it is a pleasant place to sit and relax.</review>

(Translated by Google) It's called Vitagliano winery. I was the designated driver, because people were going to celebrate the birthday of one of the two. And I took a short walk around the property. The place is very pleasant. Be careful because when you leave there may be a patrol car and the fine will be large. For DUI.

(Original)
Se llama Vitagliano winery.  Fuí como chófer designado, porque las personas iban a celebrar el cumpleaños de uno de los dos.  Y yo me dediqué a hacer un corto paseo por la propiedad.  Es muy placentero el lugar   Eso si cuidado porque al salir puede ser que haya un patrullero y la multa será grande n. Por DUI.< /text>

<name>Jen Es< /name><Date>1616371045648< /Date><rating>5<//rating><review>Started going to this restaurant since the late 80s. I had my after graduation dinner here with my whole family. My mom loved this Chinese restaurant. Since my mom past away 22 yrs ago, I haven't been there until yesterday since will be passing by on the way home. And after all this years it's still the place to go for Chinese food. They had a line of people waiting to order, I was one of them, and people waiting for their ordered food whether in the restaurant or phoned in. I ordered House special fried rice, salt & pepper pork chops, House special lo mein, honey walnut shrimps, crispy orange chicken. Bottom line, from then to now.... Always delicious! 🤤 💞👍</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOODlpRn14wFmzuRnZcz4cMEFwHS2_Dwkc1W2Xt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dd4b216e9c895d:0xdfe6f3312ce4a6d8< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>IMO this place is fine. I personally prefer its sister restaurant, Seafood Port, about 2 miles north of this place. Same owner and same menu but different cooks; which have flavors that I like better.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dd4b216e9c895d:0xdfe6f3312ce4a6d8<//gmapID><userid>115778400849627182389< /userid>< pictures>

<Text>I've been regulars at this place for the past 20 years.  The house special lobster is THE BEST I've had around the globe.  You can order shrimp, and chicken, or other dishes and ask them to make it with 'house special' sauce as well.  Salt and pepper pork chop, Fish with house special sauce, seafood chow mein, Kun Pao chicken, or Kun Pao shrimp, hot pots are all regular dish I get.  Since the lock down, they offer take out only.  Calling and order at times can be challenging to get through the phone.  Other than that, the food remains wonderful.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>The takeout dishes are the same great quality that I'm used to from dining in. One can ask for any  preparation with any kind of seafood; they are all excellent. Each serving is enough for two adults' dinner; a steal at the price.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

This place is my first choice restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this restaurant. Whenever  I I need a fair meal, this place comes immediately to my head. exeptionalgorgeous and diverse  food and a large list of dishes.helpful crew, and nice ambience. In addition to that, the cost is good. I recommend this restaurant with no doubt.< /review>

The food is always good, but the restuarant itself is a little awkward. I took my son to the bathroom which was filthy, but in the last booth in the dining room there were 2 workers preparing green beans.a huge pile of them. There are random food stations all around the restaurant. We were sat at a dirty table. It freaked my son out (he tends to have high anxiety) thinking he was going to get food poisoning. Again the food is always good. Next time I think we will just have to get takeout.< /Review>

< Review>
Better than most Chinese restaurants in the area. They have a great lunch menu with many choices served a la carte style so everyone at the table can share the choices.<//Review>

The decor was nice. But the food was really good. I usually do not eat Chinese food because I do not want to be too Asian-y. But I decided to get some food because I was really hungry and took a chance with my people.<//Review>

<Review>I love the lunch specials here. They come with soup before entree and taro dessert after, for free! The portions are very big, even at lunch and the service is superb. I love the hot tea it as well. I cannot complain about this place at all. Just a great place with great food.<//Review>< time>

<text>Extremely bland food!  Ordered Kung Pao Chicken and it had zero flavor.  No spice, nothing.  Same with the Orange Peel Beef. The chilies in the food were added at the end of cooking and imparted zero flavor to the dishes. This is the worst Chinese food I have ever had.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rate>

I really like this place! Service isn't the friendliest but it is fast! Great prices for the amount of food you get! Food is fresh and very tasty too. Only downfall is parking. The place shares a small lot and at times you have to wait a while.<//review>

Great Chinese style seafood dishes at a bargain price. Quick and efficient service (if you are looking for friendly service and staff, maybe not your place but they get it done for you). Place is kind of "rough around the edges" but the food is on point.<//text>

<text>Always packed. You should come in early to get a parking or wait for parking space. They offer Honey Walnut Shrimp even if its not on their menu. Even if it is a made to order kind of restaurant, their service is fast. They give you a bowl of streamed rice and soup right away.</text>< Pics>

Don't expect the woman at the register (owner) to care about you or even give a thanks, no matter how much you spend. She's distant, uninterested, cold, and ungrateful for your business. Food is good, so we continue going.<//Review>

Seafood Town Chinese Restaurant is a great seafood restaurant for both special occasions and regular nights. We came here after a long drive from SoCal, and noticed that the other guests were dressed a little nicer and even celebrating some birthdays. We felt a little underd ressed but they didn't pay any mind to that. The staff seated us by the window and were incredibly friendly as we got seated.

It's an old school Chinese restaurant in Torrance so it's not great but I won't hate on it. I've eaten a few times and leave satisfied but wouldn't go out of my way. There's plenty of other places to go.</Text>

Poop customer service. I've been going there since childhood, so I got used to it. But going to nicer places taught me that waiters aren't supposed to just ignore your raised hand, serve u cold food, or take 25 minutes to check up on you again.<//text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>The best hands down Chinese food in southern California. Maybe a little of a wait sometimes so I'd suggest getting there with time to spare, but other than that it's my favorite Chinese restaurant. Always freshly made and never a disappointment even when I try something new from their menu.</Text>< Time>

<review>The food is awesome. The salt and pepper fried fish is the best. Even though they give you a lot of food I still don't feel heavy after eating. The price is also good for everything that you get. The waiter seemed a little rude or rough at first but everyone is nice.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I can't judge the food, as I've never had it and I'm sure it's amazing judging by the other reviews on here too, so this isn't about that at all. I live in the apartments right next to this building and every day one of the employees that works here is just letting out this extremely loud shrieking noises or screaming, it's gotten really bad as of late too.</Review>< pics>

<review>The food here is relatively good, especially the Salt And Pepper fish filet. The portions are fairly large with prices that are reasonable.
The restaurant itself does need to be updated, as it appears to be a little worse for wear.  The booth seats are lumpy and worn. The bathrooms are filthy, so hopefully you don't need to use them.
Parking is limited, so it's sometimes better to come a little sooner than peak eating times. On Sundays and after 6 pm on other days, you can park in the lot belonging to the tire store adjacent to the restaurant. This alleviates the parking problem a great deal.
Overall, this is a good place for Chinese food, but don't expect fine dining.< /review><time>1509567128050</time><Response>None</Response>< rating>

<text>I am fond of Hong Kong style food. But the Salt and Pepper pork chops are absolutely the one item that this chinese restaurant does to perfection. Add the stir-fried vegtables and a bowl of white rice, and you will likely agree. Oh, and definitely try the desert.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This is the place that my youngest son learned to love Chinese food. Now, we go there every once in awhile and on birthdays. The lunch specials are excellent. The service is typical Chinese restaurant indifference, not rude just anonymous.

I have never ordered anything here that I did not enjoy.< /Text>

And that, my friends, is a little short of 20 years. I love their salt and pepper anything here because they put good chunks of jalapeno in each order. I love the mongolian beef too since it is well-seasoned. I could write a novel about every single item on their menu but I'll let you experience it for yourself.

Don't worry about the service. It is top-level what you can come to expect from a Chinese food establishment.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS RESTAURANT STILL STAYS OPEN!  THE OWNER OF THIS RESTAURANT IS HEARTLESS!!  I took my
4 children to this restaurant tonight for dinner after along day driving from Las Vegas and we were all starving. I ordered Calamari which my 5 year old-loves. The Calamari came out white and I didn't have a chance to try them before I feed my kids. One of my children said the Calamari is sweet that's when i tasted the Calamari. They were STALLED AND ALL THEY SEASONED WITH WAS MSG!!' then came the rice it was so stalled and old looking that made me think that they collected all the leftover rice from the tables. I complaint about being old, the waiter forcefully when and get us a "new" pot and he said the rice was newly cooked which looked a little better but still very distasteful.  We left with a table full of foods and still paid them but NASTY!!!!  PLEASE DON'T FEED YOUR CHILDREN OR FAMILY WITH THAT KIND OF FOOD!!!!  I will report this restaurant to the Health Department.  This is my first review ever and have never report anyone but this restaurant needs to be SHUT DOWN!!!  You don't feed customers something that you wouldn't dare to put in your mouth. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!</Review><Time>1491984560568< /Time>< response>

The people is not at all friendly, they were rushing me to order the food. They could not answer to my questions kindly, in conclusion don’t go if you want a excellent customer service, I when to hawthorn, owners should try to improve that, the place is all fashion un ruin, I really wanted to share with you all the bad moment I spend there, was my aunt birthday and she and I felt so bad!!! However the food is ok, but I am not going to come back<//text>

Absolutey delicious!  Very quick service in spite of the fact the restaurant was very busy. Server was great.  We had Scallops & Vegatables and Shrimp in Oyster Sauce. It came with a good soup that wasn't just watery egg flower and also a unique warm liquidy dessert.  It may have had Tapioca beans, I am not sure of anything except that I enjoyed it very much.  If I am ever in the area I will definitely being going there to eat.  Everything was more than 5 stars. I highly recommend.<//review>

<Text>I have been coming to this place since....well let's just say over 20 years. Their portions have remained family sized while other places have cut left and right. My favorites are house special chow fun no gravy, Hong Kong style crispy noodle chow mein, salt and pepper pork chop, salt and pepper fish, sweet and sour fish and sweet walnut shrimp. I also like the chicken with long bean in black bean sauce and kung Pao beef and beef or chicken in garlic sauce. You even get tapioca pudding for dessert. I do miss the guava pudding they have years ago.<//Text>< pics>

The meat portions given in the Mongolian beef and Kung pao chicken are about a 40% ratio compared to the chili’s, peanuts, green onions and other ingredients. Their fried rice is phenomenal. Their noodles are pretty okay, at least the one I ordered. I ordered a “thin yellow” noodle shrimp show mein and it was pretty dry but I didn’t mind it.<//text>

Nice and clean, fast with a little bit of KAOS , However, great Chinese food and they are open when the rest of the world is closed!  Try all the dishes, you will find them to be one of the best in Los Angeles!< /Text>

This place is amazing!  HUGE portions for a great price. Definitely not a place to goto by yourself, best if you bring a few friends, so you can order a few things and everyone share. And still have leftovers!< /Review>

They have a tremendous amount of goodies on there menu and it isn't hard picking one trust me in that. Out back bbq style everything. The waitresses are kind and it's right next door to Delamo mall with is 1 or the biggest Malls in America. You will be back if you check this location out. A+++< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It ’s been a long time in the future. When the elders were there, when they came up the mountain, they would come down to eat here. The four concubines are not as healthy as my mother ’s. They all go to eat Shanghainese when they come. Today, I thought of her aunt ’s food, so I asked her daughter-in-law to eat. Old waiter, skilled and fast, really not easy ,,, happy party, when to be carried ,,, centenarian,
