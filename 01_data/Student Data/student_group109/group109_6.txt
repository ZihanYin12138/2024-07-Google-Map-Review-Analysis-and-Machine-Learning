Very friendly and nice to be in.

The owner (?) was saying how the pandemic really affected the business ....but I got to say .....we ordered three dishes between the two of us and left extremely hungry!
There was very little meat in the dishes.
Why don't you put more meat in your food? Everything was just watery and not satisfying. I tried to fill up on rice and naan.... but you know how that goes ....it's not healthy nor is it satisfying.

On the positive side $2 for a salad is an extremely good deal and the other prices were fairly reasonable.<//text>< Pics>

I have almost tried every Indian cuisine restaurant in S.F., still this will be my favorite restaurant.  I really liked their kitchen is always on point clean and they follow hygiene safely. People working here humble and professional.
Must Try Things.
* Prawn Grill.          *. Lamb chops
* Grill Mix plate       * chicken legs and breast
*Chicken Jalfrezi.     * chicken palak
* wrap & rolls        *Biryani's
* karahi paneer.   Etc.....< /Text>

In the bay area particularly San Francisco this is the only best place to have delicious Indian n Pakistani style food. I have visited this place 4 times so far and every time I have ordered a different recipes. Every dish cooked is so classic in itself. Also the  hospitality is so great I can't wait to miss writing my reviews for this wonderful restaurant.</Review>

Amazing food and the kindest, friendliest owners. The neighborhood is so lucky to have gained this amazing restaurant. We had the samosas, garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and lamb curry and it was all fantastic. They don’t serve alcohol but you can bring your own in. Highly recommend!</text>

<Text>Chicken Tikka Masala advertised as best in the city. I thought it was "meh" average.  Paid over $14 at lunch time for a very small portion and it didn't even include rice but this is San Francisco so I guess  they have to charge almost double what it should be.<//Text>< gmap_id>

AMAZING FOOD AND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! You can tell the food is fresh as the kitchen was in the eyesight of our table. They cook everything fresh. Ordered roti and it was authentic unlike many other restaurants who uses store bought roti. Also ordered tikka masala and it was so creamy and flavorful! Loved this place !!!!< /text>

It is a very authentic north-indian restraunt with a brilliant set of chefs. In terms of food it has mouth watering tandoori starters but a inconsistent taste towards curries and in terms of ambience it is a fine-dine restraunt with very fast services on weekends. Overall this is an amazing restraunt for the most authentilc indian food.< /text>

Exactly what you'd expect. Not too pricey. Fantastic service. It seems like the staff all work together to make it happen, so hats off to the manger. Went in and got seated right away. Highly recommend their chicken tikka Masala. I quit eating that cuz my bad experience in most downtown restaurants.. who wants hairs bones in their tikka masala which is gross!  This place is clean, serves fresh Food and the service is up to par especially with good English communication skills. Definitely going back.</Review>

So, Siri suggested me this place and wanted to give it a try so I went in. I found very friendly and welcoming positive environment. Excellent service. Variety of foods and lots of option for vegetarians like me. Soft butter naan, Palak paneer, Vegetable biryani, Mango lassi and vegetable samosas were definitely the best that I have tried so far. You won't know the taste of delicious authentic masala foods until you give it a try at this restaurant. Highly Recommended!!!

Food is really and fresh! There is a lot malicious comment pertaining the food to be reuse. I asked them about it and found it is a competitor who might be jealous. Those reviews seems fake to as they all follow a specific pattern.

Back to my review:
The food was great. A lot of options ! I tried the tikka Masala fries (who doesn’t love fries) and lamb chops w/ garlic naan. It was flavorful and juicy. Masala fries was my favorite.

The complementary chai was a little weak but since it was free I’m not complaining !

The service was also good. The restaurant owner came twice to check of everything was up to standard!

Would definitely come back< /Text>

<Review>Went there today AGAIN!!!!
Tandoori chicken leg&breast, garlic naan, with chicken tikka masala(that comes with rice comp. ) and chana masala(also served with rice),  all the items were really well done, well presented and well served. Taste was just amazing, WOW!!!! I had a great experience eating here. It was clean inside, nice decorations, and they still had those valentine”i love you” balloons lol. Its a new restaurant in inner sunset but i can tell whoever prepared all those foods must have a great deal of long years of experience in cooking and working with spices. WILL DEFINETELY COME AGAIN WITH MY FRIENDS.</Review>< resp>

Was greeted by a very upbeat owner named Bobbi who made me feel right at home. Showed me around then had me in the leg tanning machine and on my way to first tan session! Talk about service. I am very happy I chose Toucan Tans to start my summer with. There are a few different stand up booths to choose from and her unique leg tanner is great since legs are the hardest to tan. I recommend this place to others. The store also has clothes and swim suits, and discount racks too.< /Text>

Definitely a wow experience... I’m headed to Mexico and wanted to get a spray tan and the owner Bobbi went above and beyond to make it happen. She was so knowledgeable and helped me practice the stances to ensure the best outcome. I’m very happy with my shopping experience, adorable clothes! I will be back and tell everyone I know to go see Bobbi.< /Review>

my girlfriend went in for a tan today and it was her first time. they did a super great job and they were kind enough to give me a dress to wear after the tan so it didn’t smear my tan. also the employees there are super kind and provided me with fantastic service!</Text>

The minute you walk into the shop you sense that the customer’s positive shopping/tanning experience is the goal. Thorough direction prior to first time spray tan treatment helps ensure an even, healthy looking tan. Bobbi is great and knows her stuff.< /review>< user_id>

<review>I cannot say enough positive things about this boutique and the owner Bobbi.  I went in to inquire about using the leg tanner.  I had an upcoming wedding to attend and was way behind in working on my tan.  Bobbi suggested a spray tan.  I was very nervous, as the wedding was the next day.  She walked me through the steps of using the spray tan machine and suggested that I go "light" as I have a fair complexion.  She was right on.  I could not be happier with the results of the spray tan.  I started looking at her beautiful collection of dresses and really wish I would have come to her first for my dress to wear to the wedding.  I didn't have time to try on bathing suits, during my first visit, but went back in upon my return from the wedding.  Again, Bobbi was so helpful.  She picked out some bathing suit styles and dresses and tops that I would never have chosen for myself.  Again, she was right on.  She goes the extra mile for her customers.  She is friendly, provides great customer service and has an excellent eye for which fashions work well with specific body types.  Her prices are also very reasonable.  I will definitely be shopping there again soon.  I would recommend Toucans Tanning and Resort Fashions to all.  You will not be disappointed.  Thanks again Bobbi!!< /review><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

I have been coming to Toucan Tans for over 10 years. No other tanning salon in Redding can beat the prices or service at Toucans! Plus Toucans has the best year round selection of swim suits, as well as some really cute clothes! Absolutely love this place!</Review>

I have been coming to Toucan Tans for over 10 years. No other tanning salon in Redding can beat the prices or service at Toucans! Plus Toucans has the best year round selection of swim suits, as well as some really cute clothes! Absolutely love this place!</Text>

I would have to say toucan tans is one of the best tanning salons in Redding.  The prices are fair and the quality  of the tanning beds are amazing.  I've been to the majority of tanning salons Redding has to offer and I can honestly say that toucan tans had me looking more tan in half the time it took with lay down beds.  Bobbi is easy going, great to talk with and offers excellent customer service.  I recommend going to try the leg Tanner!  It's amazing.  😊< /Text>

I have had a great experience. Being a "virgin" tanner Bobbi has lead me through every step of the way. When I went in she gave me instructions for all of the machines, she even gave me my first tan for free...I saw immediate results from day one. The store is clean and there are some great deals on some beautiful fashions too.</review>

OMG Toucan Tans ROCKS!!!! Not only do they have EVERYTHING you'll need for that great summer tan, including the Versa Sunless Tanner, a great legs only tanning bed and 3 other stand-up beds too but they are also fully stocked with more swimsuits than I could ever try on!!! Bobbi the owner is super knowledgeable and an absolute delight!!! I'm never going anywhere but Toucan Tans!!!! 5 stars in my book!!!!!<//Review>

What a great experience every time! Bobbi has such a fun personality she really makes everyone feel individually appreciated. She offers the best prices and runs a tight ship when it comes to cleanlyness and organizeation. And this is all done with such grace. I highly recomend this boutique to everyone. Not just for a quality tanning experience but also for the adorable selection of swimwear and cute summer dresses. The prices are  unbelievably low too. The most outstanding small business in Redding, by far!!<//text>

<Review>Just want to give a MAJOR shout out to Bobbi! She is the sweetest, most down to earth business owner I know. I recently received a FREE week at Palm Beach tans on churn creek, and after having only ONE 5 minute session I knew I would never go back due to their customer service. The service at Toucan, whether it's Bobbi or someone else she trusts to present a good face for her business, you are ALWAYS treated with respect! Being treated well at an establishment that is designed to make you feel better is a double win! Her staff is educated with the products to help you figure out which lotions would work better for your skin (I.e hypoallergenic, scentless, bronzer, even single tan shots!) because tanning without lotion DOESNT make sense.
Not to forget, her equipment is the bomb! I LOVE the wrap around leg tanner!
Needless to say, if you're looking for a new tanning salon, I would HIGHLY recommend Toucan.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1480740949604, 'text': "thank you ;) i love waiting on you... you've always got a smile on your pretty face and are so easy to please!

<text>I've been tanning at Toucans for about 10 years and I gotta say, this place rocks!! The owner Bobbie knows her business! (I been everywhere but i always come back to Bobbis) i bought a lotion from ** n she explained whyyy its not perfect for ME and GAVE me a bottle to try!! Ya, I don't see that happening anywhere else. she cares about the customer more than the hard sell (plus her clothes r awesome!)< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

this gas station is very good very low pricing most of the time to 89 per gallon on a regular unleaded gas tank and I hadn't considered anybody who wants cheap prices on gas at ennio morricone was majority of them have trade prices for your car or truck< /Review>

Went to fill up with gas after a three hour drive.  After putting in 50 dollars worth of gas, asked if I could air up my tires, they told me the air dispensing machine was out order. Funny, because as I drove up I saw someone filling their tires with the air hose.
Bad customer service.</Text>

Nice station but all there is here is BevMo boot barn and best by there is no food really close by. There is a few restaurants which are closed due to the pandemic but there are no bathrooms just a warning there are no bathrooms here it looks like it would be a little dark at night as well. I would probably only come back here to charge in the daytime.  I did feel safe here in a day with my daughter.</review>

Not the usual speed you get at a Supercharger. There are only 2 other cars charging and I am getting only 64kW when this station is rated up to 120KW. Also, under 200mi/hr when I only have less that 10% charge.< /Review>

This is the place to stop for Bay Area -> Tahoe drivers.  Lots of great food, well lit parking, food options are open late.  I highly recommend it.</review>

One of Two superchargers in the area wish there was more in Sacramento but can't complain. It does get busy at times but usually a short wait. The chargers over by Arden usually never have wait and you can walk around an indoor mall while you wait to fill up when it's cold outside.<//Text>

Bit of a walk to anything other than Best Buy & BevMo, but movies, food, and shops if it's a nice day out and you've got your tennis shoes on.</Review>

This is undoubtably the worst located Tesla supercharger than I have ever visited. If you are on interstate five do not think that this will be a quick stop unless you want to see all the highlights and lowlifes of suburban Sacramento. It will take at least 10 minutes from the freeway in each direction. Stay away!< /text>

The food was great! The staff were really nice. My order was under $30 bucks. I got a
110. Chicken Cali blow: $5.95
Salmon roll: $5.95
106. Chicken Teriyaki: $8.95
And 2 Raspberry Ice Tea drinks: $3.50
Total of $26.24 including the $1.89 tax
Would recommend!</review>

Been coming here a couple times a month since 2014, when I used to work in the same shopping center. In my 6+ years of coming here, they have never messed up an order and I have never gotten sick. The quality is amazing compared to most sushi places in OC that I've been to. I've tried a majority of the items on the menu over the years; the volcano roll and super philly roll remain my favorites. Before COVID (when you could dine-in) they gave you complimentary miso soup and edamame. Definitely try this place out - you can't beat the quality for the price! No matter how busy they are - they always greet you, confirm your order with you, and the sushi chefs thank you as you leave. Thank you Kyotori for always being a reliable and satisfactory place for my sushi cravings! Keep up the great work! :)</text>

<review>Their lunch special bento boxes are really good for the money, but their sushi is only so so.  Their service is very prompt which I love and my water was never empty.  5 star service 4 star food.  It is more pricey to eat here as opposed to fast food but you get a quality meal that is mostly good for you.<//review><resp>None<//resp><time>1558915037870< /time><name>Christopher Mitchell</name>< UserId.>

I love coming here for lunch. I work around the area and this is definitely my favorite spot to go to during lunch hour. The food Is good and the service is quick and attentive. You must try their baked spicy salmon roll. I never get tired of it.</review>

<text>One of their soup noodle (forgot what it was called) was too salty which I think is due to the meat being in the soup. If I had it on the side it probably would have been ok but then the meat itself was too salty. I didnt really like the thickness of the soup also but that is probably just my preference as I see that they are packed bright early in the morning with a long wait line. The octopus balls were delicious. Place was was small inside.</text><gmapID>0x80dd285d7cbef16b:0x8b11ad8debda1cde< /gmapID>< name>

Good service, the chefs at the front sushi counter are very polite and make bomb fresh sushi and they will accommodate your special requests. The sushi here is very good quality and fresh.  I recommended the Baked Spicy Salmon Roll and the Crunch Roll!! So good!  Come early cause it can get crowded and they sometimes run low on rice by the end of the night,  lol!</Text>

<Text>Favorite sushi place for consistently fresh fish, always tastes great, never dissapointed. Personal favorites are the baby lobster and scallop role as well as the garlic albacore. Girlfriend likes the oishi role and tuna Pataki. Also shoutout to the jalapeno bombs. Staff and cheffs are also very friendly, good music and good vibes.

I stopped eating here even though the food is good because the restaurant always reeks of body odor, no matter what time of day I visit. I assumed at first it was a member of the staff, but I've come to learn that this particular smell is actually not body odor but poor cleaning practices. It's dirty towels used over and over with cleaning agents. If the health department were to get their hands on  this place they'd have a field day I'm sure.</review>

<Text>The first time , I came to this restaurant , I think that I will never come back for dinner or lunch , even for take out because food is not good and very expensive with roll over 12 dollars but only 6 pieces with size like a thumb .
I am very unhappy , I think that you want your business develop in the future , you should change your way , If you still follow this way , I think your restaurant will be closed because people come only a time and never come back , like me< /Text><date>1378523882401<//date><userid>109423297247140610115< /userid>< gmapID>

<text>I got an albacore salad and it comes with six pieces of fish. The salad they used appears to be the spring mix from Costco. Anyway, I paid $12 for it and i felt was overpriced. I probably will avoid all places like this in the future (dime a dozen sushi restaurants run by Koreans). My stomach felt funny afterwards too.< /text><Time>1512430942576< /Time><user_id>115041038156916677863< /user_id><name>T Nguyen</name>< GmapID>

Amazing wines! The hospitality is on point....Dennis and Erik go above and beyond. My favorite place to just chill by the fire and have a glass of wine. The ambiance is very relaxing and everyone who visits is super friendly.  They are definitely still onto something!! A must go in the Central Valley and on River Rd!< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Boutique family-style winery. This place is definitely hidden, but once you discover it, you will remember it forever for its amazing wine! The QPR is there for Odonata! Denis and Jr. are doing amazing interesting wines from the area such as sparkling riesling and carbonic carignan. Highly recommend stopping by and spoil your palate with some delicious wine.</Text>< Pics>

This is a hidden gem! The wines were very good and the setting Iow key - just the way it used to be! Napa and Sonoma are more like Disneyland now - tasting here is much less ‘crazy’ and is done in a more relaxed manner.<//Text>

Odonata is one of those rare gems. In a world of big, flashy wineries, Odonata stands out as a place to come to relax, chat, and enjoy some great wine.

My wife and I stopped here driving through the area, and we were pleasantly surprised. The host was so friendly and easy to chat with, and he did a great job of making us feel welcome and provided fun conversation. We really enjoyed the wine and the casual atmosphere. It’s a small tasting room that feels quaint and lends itself well to actually tasting wine.</text>

Went there on a Saturday afternoon. We stayed there till closing. It was after 5 pm and we were not kicked out. Met some friends there and had a good time. I cannot say enough about customer service, which was exceptional. We were treated very well.  I highly recommend Odonata</text>

<Review>Odonata is one of our favorite wineries to visit anywhere in California.  We have never had anything but great experiences at Odonata, and Denis is simply a great winemaker.  You can be very confident that anything you purchase will impressive even your most serious wino friends.  Hope you have the chance to experience the wines of Odonata.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80920975d4ebb04b:0x318606bbec4e9993</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<username>Sara niemiec</username><time>1576717068697<//time><rating>5< /rating><Text>The wines offered at odonata are amazing!! From the black dartar, rosé of Sangiovese, River skimmer and more, they all have unique pallets that make them individually distinct. Every time I visit I have to come and do a wine tasting.

The staff are stellar. Dennis, Junior and Nolan are only a few of the amazing team that help customers feel special and a part of the family when they come visit.

If you haven’t joined their wine of the month club, you must. Having wine picked out for you and ready to be picked up/delivered makes enjoying their wine that much better.

If I could give Odonata 100 stars I would, there are so many things I could say and not enough space.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Odonata wines ROCK!  If you haven't stopped by their tasting room on River Road in Salinas, do so right away. All of Denis's wines are excellent! Plus they have sparkling that will knock your socks off. Highly recommend a visit - or 6!<//Review>< pictures>

Enjoyed a tasting here the sparkling riesling was my favorite. The woman working there was very friendly and chatty and some of the patrons were giving us suggestions of other wineries in the area we should also try.< /Text>

First, it is in such a pretty location. 2nd, the staff is the SWEETEST, friendliest, most welcoming people i have ever met in a business (except for ours!).

The wines are DELICIOUS!!!!  I bought 4 bottles because i wanted to go home, remember the experience and re-enjoy the wines!

Visit. I think you will agree!

We love Koninkrijk Koffiehhuis! Their coffee is delicious (I love their cold brew) and the pastries are amazing! We have yet to try a pastry we didn't like. Highly recommend the chicken pesto pastry, bear claws, and chocolate chip cookies - but you really can't go wrong with anything they have! The owners are the nicest people. We're so lucky to have this coffee shop in Chester!<//Text>

We spent the weekend up there and stopped by 3 times, each time getting to try a new delicacy.  I would highly recommend heading their way to grabbing a nice coffee and an authentic European pastry.< /text>< pics>

<Review>This place is absolutely incredible. The owner was wonderful and friendly. He made small samplers of new recipes and treats and brought them out for the customers to try. He was very open for discussion and what they could improve on. The cafe had the perfect combo of quick bites and a vibe of welcoming. I felt very comfortable sitting for multiple hours eating cookies, drinking coffee, and chatting. This place is a great addition to Chester and I would recommend anyone to go there.

Very good and reliable wifi as well!< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMQlKipj3eH5I0CLJnhdIoEPArNU9l7pikTL7l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjhp-XmfXHdCB9BpoDpAM_ljmImRlVLLoChbqb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Nice new coffee shop!! Opened in June of 2019. The food is all prepared on-site and it is all amazing. Everything from savory pesto/chicken/potato calzone to freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and bear claws. Fast Wifi too! Deli sandwiches for lunch as well.<//Review>

My husband and I ate breakfast here everyday we were in Chester. We couldn't get enough of their delicious breakfast calzones, pastries and espresso chocolate chip cookies. Great iced coffee mocha too. The owners and employees were so much fun to talk to. Love their outfits.< /text>

< Review>
This is a wonderful coffee shop in a rural town in northern CA. I come up here to visit my grandmother during the summer and occasionally fall / winter, and I'm glad this town got a good coffee shop. The coffee is wonderful, the shop has a good atmosphere, and the pasties are made from scratch. Definitely worth stopping by, this is now my go-to coffee shop whenever I'm in town.< /Review>

Was looking for a snack and a beer and this was the perfect stop. The sausage calzone was fabulous. Paired perfectly with a German Dunkel.
Will be back!</review>

Pastries were tasty, and the coffee was good. Staff was very friendly. This is one of the two bright spots in town for eating that  Chester needs as the food by and large sucks here.</Text>

I came through Chester on a recent trip to Northern California and was surprised to see a Dutch name on the sign across the road from the gas station I stopped at. I decided to check out this place and had one of their pastries. As a Dutch person I can attest that these pastries were really well done, very authentic, and they tasted great! The owners are also incredibly nice, and the wifi is reliable and fast. Definitely recommend this place if you're interested in some pastries, a hot beverage, and maybe even lunch (though I didn't try that). I miss Dutch-style homemade pastries in the SF Bay Area but I was so glad to find some here!< /Text>

Rachel and Mark and their staff reall provide a warm and hospitable experience for their locals and the summer tourists alike. I spent the year up north in Chester and Westwood , and lived right behind the shop. And despite the initial overreaction by some of the local , i was sold on Day 1 with the most fabulous French Onion Soup and Espresso over ice. Both baristas seemed very knowledgeable and personable. I do wanna give an extra mention to the Matron of the House, Rachel,  for her fabulous baked goods. All the best ,and I hope to be returning to Lake Almanor for the grand reopening of dine in for the summer. Hope to be once again.at the bar sipping on coffee or tea and a pastry  Cheers. Fernando,  your fellow Barista Consultant !< /review>

We had a bear claw and the fruit basket with cream pastry. The crust on both were delectable and the family loved every bite. Coffee is fresh and yes they do have specialty drinks too. We loved it so much we returned Sunday morning to grab a pastry for the road. What a great add to and new gem to the town of Chester! We look forward to another visit soon.

Ps. Very fast WiFi too and clean restrooms with changing table make it very family friendly< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Such a friendly and warm welcome when I came in! Identified as being “on a mission” they were respectful of my time but also introduced me to all of the delish options in the pastry case. Wish I had time to wait for the quiche that was baking but had to settle for a potato sausage pastry that blew my mind! Tried to save some to share, but it was simply too good. The chocolate peanut butter treat that I purchased as a surprise to share with my husband was just as good. Can’t  Wait to return to enjoy more of their delish food!< /Text>

This place and the owners are THE BEST. The coffee options are excellent, baked goods and all food are beyond reproach. Quiches and calzones, spicy peanut butter bars and chocolate espresso cookies: everything is homemade and served with incredible hospitality. The weekly strudel is the perfect example of unadulterated authentic yumminess- real apples and nuts and hand thrown pastry- not the sugary store-bought dross. Pleasantly surprised to find something like this in Chester. It’s always a special treat to visit in my weekly trips to work in the area. Hope they last a long time!</Review>

<Time>1507575903324< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>We stopped in this morning for breakfast after driving by. The service was friendly and the food was better than expected. We were kind of assuming it would be typical diner food, but it was really good. I had the California Benny- eggs Benedict with tomato and avocado. I got the hollandaise on side because it's so hit or miss when you eat out, but it was perfect!  Whoever is making the hollandaise knows what he/she is doing. Eggs were also perfectly poached.

My husband had biscuits with sausage gravy and the gravy was delicious.  Decent prices, too, which is a must for dinning out with a family of six.< /text>< pictures>

This is my favorite restaurant, by far.  Their menu is varied; any selection lands you a tasty meal.  For lunch try the Tuna Manhattan *heavenly*, or the shrimp salad.  Whatever you choose, you won't be disappointed!  The atmosphere is welcoming, the wait staff are engaging.  This is a must-visit when you are in Auburn.</Review>

The only thing good about The Daily Egg,  and I mean GOOD. .not great,  not excellent, is the good.  The menu was good,  food was prepared well,  but took 15 minutes to have a server come take our order. Biscuits and gravy were cold and inedible, not that my appetite was all that great in the first place since the table next to ours (which had no diners at it) was filthy and never bussed the whole time we were there, very unappetizing. Would highly suggest bussing tables in a timely manner,  and not making customers who aren't regulars feel forgotten .</text>

This is a very lovely quaint Store that’s full of beautiful options for all kinds of jewelry needs.

But what was even more lovely what is the customer service that I received having not a clue what to look for I was shown everything under the sun with no apprehension it was just a wonderful buying experience. If you get a chance to be held by Deborah then you’re a lucky person she really went above and beyond and showed me everything that I asked for it was just absolutely pleasant thanks again Debbie you made my day and for sure my girlfriends birthday love the shop glad y’all are still open and Doing so well!
Cheers!</text>

Received great service, reasonable pricing, quick turn-around, friendly and professional staff.

Purchased upgraded engagement ring from them over a decade ago.  Recently lost a small diamond from the side setting.  They were able to replace the lost diamond and build up the mounting to prevent future issues.  To keep my ring in optimal condition, they are offering free inspection every 6 months to ensure the mounts look good and gems secure.< /Review>

Bought my ring and my wife’s rings from Hollingsworth. Tammy and Debi and wonderful people and help you make the right decision. Everyone should come to this family owned business.

<text>I love the hometown feeling of this Jewelry store, where they even remembered me, and I've only been in the store once before picking up my ring today!  They sized my ring perfectly!  Having the wish list option is awesome.  I'll definitely send my husband there for my gifts!<//text></record></dataset><record>

I got my wedding ring re-sized here and had such a wonderful experience! My mother and I came in and were greeted by Debi, who was so sweet and knowledgeable. They had my ring ready for pick-up much faster than I expected, and I am thrilled with the quality of work! Thank you!!!<//text>

When my family first moved to Petaluma I needed a jeweler.  I asked multiple persons and read multiple reviews before, finally deciding to visit Hollingsworth.  I am so glad I found these wonderful people.  The craftsmanship is second to none. The quality is impeccable.  And, most of all they are kind, generous and honest.   They make you feel right at home with their genuine next door neighbor kindness.  I especially love their dog, too.  I live out of the country now but, when I am home visiting my brother and father I often need something repaired and I always go to this amazing business.  You will not be disappointed.  If I lived anywhere in the Bay Area and I needed a Jeweler...I would drive to Petaluma to visit these genuine people and true professionals.< /text>

I have bought a number of beautiful pieces here. They are very accommodating and patient and will go the extra mile to assist. They don’t rush you and allow plenty of time for browsing. If they don’t have what you are looking for, the books come out and they will order, at no charge or commitment, what you want. I love it! And they have a great dog there who hangs out! You will not be disappointed.< /Text>

DO NOT GO HERE, unless you want to be attacked by a barking dog.

I have gone to this store many times and I have recommended them to family and friends. I went recently during the pandemic and they were open and doors unlocked so anyone can walk in, however when I did a large dog came running out and cornered me in the front of the store. The dog was barking and jumping at me. I was literally just looking around, waiting to be helped. The owners just kept saying, "its our son's dog" and "it's only 3 years old." They couldn't even get the dog away because the did not have a collar on it. I am lucky that I am not afraid of dogs, but this was extremely dangerous and unprofessional. They didn't even say sorry until i told them that it was frightening being cornered in the store.< /review>

<Review>I took a ring to be sized and to check if the stones were securely in the ring.  They examined the ring and told me the stones were safe and no work needed to be done.  I appreciated their honesty.  I had my ring sized and it was done in a couple of weeks (not bad since it's the holiday season).  They cleaned the ring and sized it perfectly.  Looks great.  I've had other work done there in the past.  Always honest and reliable.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Mike and Tammy are incredibly kind and helpful people. I bought my wife’s engagement ring here as well as her wedding band and my wedding ring. Each time, they were very friendly and seem very knowledgeable and passionate about their jewelry. Their staff is just as friendly as they are, and it’s never bad when theirs a cute yellow Labrador to greet you when you walk in (which they have!). I will definitely be making any jewelry purchases there from now on! You should do the same! Thank you, Hollingsworth!<//Text>

My husband worked with Hollingsworth to secretly purchase the most PERFECT engagement ring! We couldn't go anywhere else for the wedding band! He even had my wedding gift set here. The ring set, though chosen separately, go so well together!! The diamond he chose initially is well set - I'm never worried about it. We just had the band and engagement rings welded together. Hollingsworth took care of us every step of the way!! They are absolutely amazing!</text>

Incredible service and staff. And wonderful selection. Great attention to detail. I love this place and the people (especially Debi, who has now become a friend) here. This was one of the first experiences for me in Petaluma and surely set an example of how lovely the people are in this beautiful small town. Support local!<//review>

I am so impressed with the recent major wedding ring repair.  I’ve been wearing my wedding ring for 32 years, but after it broke a few weeks ago, and I didn’t know if or how it might get repaired. Hollingsworth Jewelers did a fantastic job making the replacement parts which I lost after they broke off. The job they did exceeded my expectations!  Now I will have the repaired shiny, sparkly wedding ring back on my finger just in time for my daughters wedding in May.</Review>

How do I love Hollingsworth Jewelers? Let me count the ways.
1. The staff and owners are friendly not in smarmy car salesman way.
2. If you are looking for something in particular  they are always willing to bring out the catalogs, bring out the hidden treasures  or offer to have an item made.
3. I appreciate their workmanship on everything from their stocked items to cleaning and repairing jewelry.
4. The staff and owners always have time to explain what can and cannot be done.
5. Local  jewelers who care and you can trust with your family heirlooms.
6. This is one of the best places to find unique estate jewelry  but you may have to ask and have time to look through unpriced treasures.

Shop local. Buy from local folks that care.

This was the greatest experience for our wedding bands. They are voted #1 Jewelers in Petaluma for a reason. Great service, quality products and prompt delivery. We gave them two weeks to come up with a custom wedding band to match an existing engagement ring. They created it in less time. My wife was very pleased with the ring. I would give them 10 stars. Thank you Tammy!<//Review>

I have had a wonderful personal experience every time I've gone in. They always have the perfect piece I'm looking for any family member. I bought a necklace for one daughter and went back a year later to buy the same one for my other daughter and Tamara remembered the exact piece and ordered the second one. She is also more than happy to help design unique pieces to suit any price point. I highly recommend!</text>

<review>We came to Hollingsworth in a bit of a panic because another jeweler we had been working with really dropped the ball on getting my wedding band, and the wedding was only weeks away.

Tammy and Mike run an amazing store in Petaluma!! I have been shopping with them for over 10 years and can't recommend them enough. I started shopping with them when I went to pick out my engagement ring. They provide welcoming, knowledgeable, and professional service. I've since gone back to them to get everything from watches to earrings for both myself and my wife. All the pieces are of phenomenal quality. I've since recommended multiple friends to check them out and all of them walked away with pieces of jewelry that they love!<//text>

< Review>
Their price for a simple soldering a clasp back onto a neck was over priced. I don't beleive a half a roll of silver solder cost that much. They are fairly niece folks, they will make you wait and not address till they are done with their current customer. So okay, three stars maybe a 2 and a half.<//Review>

<Text>Unbelievably friendly, great service. Extremely efficient and I love how they email when your item is ready for pickup. The only reason I get 4 stars instead of 5 is I thought they were quite expensive ($45 for a new watch battery and tightening of a clasp)<//Text>< Name>

Had an engagement ring resized to a smaller setting. From a 9 to 6.5.

It came back oval rather than round, which given the type of ring I understand the need, but where the jeweler connected the cut pieces it wasn’t very uniform. Uneven at the bottom of the shank and the filigree on one side is now a little longer than the other side. It looks haphazardly done.< /review>

There's a good reason Hollingsworth Jewelers Gallery has been in business for a solid 14 years: they know jewelry and they seriously understand the needs of their customers.  They're also very gentle during the potentially anxiety-inducing process of getting married. When I think about it, every time I look at my ring, I'll think of my spouse first...and then Hollingsworth. That's a very long-term endorsement, yes?< /text>

My mom recently passed and I was left her gold and diamond ring.  I cried and cried when I had to take it off for sizing and cleaning and leave it with the Jeweler at Hollinsworth.  The dear receptionist was so caring and assured me my ring is in good hands!!  He fixed my Granny's ring..is what she shared with me.  Today I picked up my ring!!  It looked so beautiful!!  All the diamonds are secure..gold was added so it fits proper and it is so, so shinny!! Thank you Hollingsworth Jewelers Gallery for your honestly, being professional and your front desk gal !!!!!</Text>

<text>I have dealt with Hollingsworth Jewelers Gallery many times in the past but this time they out did themselves. I had a special project for my daughter's birthday for them to take on. They worked with me every step of the way and I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome.< /text>< Resp>

Fantastic barbeque, definitely my go to for when I want authentic BBQ and not restaurant ribs or pulled pork. They have everything you could want and the prices are reasonable as well. I personally like Blake's Big BBQ Plate because you get some of everything. I also got The Beast today and it's also fantastic with three different kinds of meat on it. Those two things are more than enough to feed the whole family and have leftovers for tomorrow. The staff is also very welcoming and always friendly.<//text>

<Text>Blake's Place is a spot you have to try out. The BBQ is amazing. The fries with brisket is awesome.  The staff always takes care of the customers from ordering to refills till your out the door. Very friendly. And the owner , great guy. I'm glad they made it through all the Covid restrictions. My wife and I have done take out on New Years eve ,  those are the meats in the tray the ones in the plate are from dining in this past weekend. And if you like your BBQ with some heat buy a bottle of the spicy BBQ sauce.< /Text><userid>104098530700319598420</userid><GmapID>0x80dcd68d971c2551:0x8da563562c17d50a< /GmapID><Name>Jash Singh< /Name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHqLQC7QvgoylMWgtB_4s3wmBmQsTkjDjeeSZm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzt1bR2YQThqrZxNnTzaq3xPBLUv5drFFxxKpq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhM9E-AWslQDOalfglOhX6XS0VcJpY_7KrChA2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKbHAbZ8iIA4TuM935rJr9xMbrFBI-tkQv7pqY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEUGZZRo_OqX9LBX1sjK2422YNYzDUURwfvdYk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8lpsURmN1_whLVcC3pvQXaB41R4LaJJFdnhOg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQMN_n-95OwUlTyNNsSSH9O20t3M0dyRATats1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqxTfihKBFiGe4yqWQW0_HbOphVi0OC2SHrDFS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1TIBjraLBYLFJAFAJUL9BixOcBByMSH2zfkhS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

<review>Bottom line, great food and service. Very pleasing atmosphere. The aroma of barbeque, along with high spirits made my first time here enjoyable. Parking doesn't seem bad, menu is very easy to understand. There was a female cashier who greeted/helped my group, and the owner's son was a big help as well- both friendly.

Loved the aesthetic of the place, very clean and plenty of room.
I ordered a Tasha's trio which includes: 3 sandwiches. One containing chicken, pulled pork, and the last brisket. I had a side of coleslaw. My friends got some meat and salad

They were all delicious sandwichs, but the one top the rest was that smokey, succulent brisket. That white bread with mouthwatering BBQ slathered on tender brisket?! You guys are killing it! 💯  Next time I go, which surley I will, best believe I'm going to get that brisket. Thanks for the hard work.  👍🏼

The sweet and spicy was my favorite (apricot and chili). My friend had the super spicy Buffalo wings; he loved them doused in ranch dressing. The service was great , I believe we were asked if we needed anything at least 4 times. The place was not too busy but you could tell it's a hot spot. Loved it.< /text>< pics>

Loved the chicken buffalo salad.  I wasn't able to finish my salad and took the rest home for lunch the following day. My son had the Nachos and I thought they looked a little strange but my foodie son cleaned his plate.
Atmosphere was charming and clean. Staff was friendly although they were very busy. COVID guidelines were being followed.< /review>

Most people go for the brisket, but the smoked turkey is phenomenal. Flavorful, tender. You should try it!< /Text>

<Review>It was my first time at Blakes and was recommend by a friend.  First off..... the baked beans ARE INCREDIBLE!!  I ordered a full rack of ribs and it was awesome!  I was so happy to know that my ribs didn’t fall of the bone.  It was perfect!  If I had only a minor complaint, it was the bbq sauce.  It was good, but it seemed to me this batch had too much ginger.... at least that’s what my taste buds detected.   None the less, I recommend this place for sure and I will definitely come back!!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Found this place looking for something besides Mexican food in the area. I'm so glad we discovered this place. The food is very, very delicious, and well priced.

What's even better is the staff. They knew we were new there and they made sure we enjoyed ourselves. We truly look forward to returning.<//review>

The aroma of barbeque, along with high spirits made my first time here enjoyable. Parking doesn't seem bad, menu is very easy to understand.<//Text>

Probably the best smoked brisket you'll find in Orange County! And there are a lot of good ones out there.</Review>

Such a good place to eat.  Hard to find as it's in an industrial strip mall, but when you do find it you won't be disappointed.  Some of the best BBQ around.  Try their sandwich sampler so you can try different meats and find your favorite.  What is surprising was to me their turkey sandwich is excellent.  I would have thought the beef would have been the best, but the turkey was so good.  I've yet to have a bad thing from this place.  They also want to make sure they are doing good and check on you to make sure.  Definitely check this place out.  I've posted the current menu so you can get prices.  They are in the pricey side, but it's quality BBQ in a casual setting.  Much better than chain places like Dickie's.< /Review>

<Review>This place is class all the way, but you'll pay for it.  If money is no object, I have not been to a better restaurant in the entire city.  The interior is exquisite, you'll have more than one waiter serving your table, and the food is perfect.  I am a very hard man to please but this place pleased me both times that I was fortunate enough to eat there.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The Mac n cheese barely tasted like anything (even my 5yr old didn't like it and he likes all mac n cheese) and the "blakes dip" was lacking flavor too... wish I hadn't spent my money here.< /Review>

<Text>I frequent this unique place many times since I enjoy the ambiance that is part of this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and well trained. The service is impressively quick. Not to mention, the food they cook is excellent. I frequent often and I was always pleased. The cost is fair. I highly suggest this place to to all.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>We were driving by and saw how popular it looked so we turned around and came in for dinner. Menu all looked great, with lots of options. I settled on the sandwich trio and my wife got a salad. Sandwiches were all good, the BBQ wasn't super smoky, but it was a lot of meat for the money and good quality. My wife's salad was mediocre she said. Great atmosphere, lots of TV's and nice people, great spot.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxE9GoQIeIquYq5bZ3q5juWZFsDzh8svI4eKCO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_0gWZDZehkqn2IRbEtOG7YjOU7-_pL4k9tLRR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxNQS9pdgkIw87ZjMuld-tlZb2LPfcSKVqdMwk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

<text>I ordered through Grubhub a brisket sandwich and a chicken and rib dinner. I had heard that their barbecue was really good. I don’t know what went wrong but it was so dry I couldn’t eat it. It literally built up in my mouth. The brisket had no flavor it was super dry no juice. Same with the baby back ribs. Very dry no flavor. The chicken was good, Very moist but tiny pieces. Potato salad was very good and so are the beans. Maybe they were just having a bad day. The barbecue sauce has a vinegar base which I’m not used to but it was good. Probably will not go back.</text>< pictures>

I've eaten here a few times now and you can't go wrong no matter what you order. Everything is delicious! Believe it or not but the Blake's signature salad with chopped brisket is my usual choice. Went with the sandwich trio this time around and it was absolutely fantastic.< /text>

We love this place for a great meal and break from work. The food is some of the best BBQ in town with lots of selections. I prefer the buffalo chicken salad. They are always friendly and efficient. They do great takeout for office meeting too.< /text>

<text>Decided to try this place for lunch during a business trip.  Was pleasantly surprised by the taste and tenderness of the brisket sandwich.  The baked beans were ok, and the sweet tea isn't made in-house...but I still enjoyed it.  Food came fast and hot.</text><gmapID>0x80dcd68d971c2551:0x8da563562c17d50a< /gmapID><date>1583357240761</date><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPapP8mt9UXrau8ThjkgNOKuDz1YQsJRWW4VQCC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< user_id>

Food wasn’t too bad, but not high quality for the price. Sauce is awesome, but I had to use more sauce to cover up the flavor of some of the meat. Coleslaw and beans were great.< /Text>

I wish this visit was as good as 7 years ago... I was in the area attending a meeting and looked forward to lunch at Blake's... My sandwich was missing the "delicious" portion as before...  Was it flavorful, fresh, mouthwatering??? Yes!!... But I sure missed you the portion I enjoyed before!!! :o(</Review>

Service here was very fast. I got the three meat plate with turkey, brisket and chicken. While tasty the meats didn’t have very much of a smoke flavor. Coleslaw was decent but stay away from the Mac n cheese, tasted very chemically and fake.
Checkin on yelp to get a free cookie.
Get quite a lot of food for the price.</Review>

BBQ in California? Well if you are from the Midwest  or the South, you won’t be blown away by this food but it is close enough to the real deal in a pinch. The owner is really nice and was working hard to ensure that all customers were satisfied.  The coke dispenser stopped working during my visit a so the wait staff didn’t miss a beat and started handing out canned sodas to its guests. That quick reaction and solution to the problem is how it should be. Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. Lots of seating too. Great for big groups at the lastt minute.</Text>

<review>Delicious  meal. We had funeral reception for my Mother's  passing.  Delivery  time was spot on quote. We served  bbq chicken, brisket, green beans, bbq beans and and a salad. Having a real vegetable as an option other potato  salad or macaroni  salad made made it an exception meal. Friends and family couldn't get enough. Thank you Blake's,<//review>< rating>

If you love bbq, this is the place.  Over the years Ive tried about everything.  When I worked around the corner,  I had an addiction to their good food.   My goto sandwich is the ortega chili melt w/turkey.  My goto salad is the Buffalo salad(you need to like spicy for this one)  onion rings are great,  but I woild suggest you eat them there,  they are not as crispy if you get them to go.<//Review>

The reason I ended up eating at this restaurant in a very strange, all warehouses, commercial structures location, because it was chosen for the group I was part of, after we went to event. They had pretty much set of menu for us. I only eat chicken and it ended up pretty good. I wish they would have at least regular coffee or tea.</text>

First time coming to this place and it was soooooo good!!! 🤤🤤 My boyfriend and I ordered separate plates (pastrami sandwich with cole slaw and the “Lil’ Beast” with BBQ beans). Everything was amazing! It tasted so good and so authentic and home made. I am definitely coming back in the near future 🥰< /Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>This an awesome place to experience great barbecue made by hard working salt of the earth people!  I am talking about real food, like fresh baked beans stewed with chunks of barbecued pork, not canned.  The Coleslaw was fresh, and I loved the celery seed seasoning to give it that extra fresh flavor.  And the barbecue...well, you'll have to experience the tender fall apart brisket and flavorful ribs.  Even their spicy barbecue sauce was good, with a nice kick, but not too much heat to scare off most timid diners.  The establishment was very clean and the service welcoming. One thing to note is that their diet soda selection was out of order on my visit.  Overall, a rare reasonably priced find, that I hope will continue to prosper in this out of the way industrial sector!< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< user_name>

We never anticipated finding such delicious and reasonably priced food in the area. They're located in an industrial park but easily viewable from the street. If you're a BBQ lover, you're in for a treat. They offer a huge variety of food, and so far we've tried their tender, fall off the bone, ribs, pastrami, pulled pork, pork roast, homemade mac and cheese, baked beans, and their cookies. We have yet to be disappointed! They're in the mix an amazing staff that is friendly, helpful and makes you feel like family from your first visit, and you have yourself a winning location to dine at.

Something to keep in mind if visiting with a larger group is that you'll easily fit on the patio, but the inside is on the smaller side with only about 12 tables that are mostly 4-tops. So plan accordingly.<//text>

<Text>Excellent BBQ. Better than lots of larger more expensive sit down type restaurants. If you're in the Anaheim area try it out I'm pretty sure you will love them also.

Pulled pork is excellent their baked beans or barbecued beans are excellent along with their brisket. Their sides like coleslaw and potato salad are very good also. And don't rule out their beef salad.</Text><time>1546129741528</time><GmapID>0x80dcd68d971c2551:0x8da563562c17d50a</GmapID><Response>None<//Response><Name>Celeste Lavacot<//Name></record></dataset><record>

HEY, "BLAKE'S PLACE":  I AM SERIOUS ABOUT THIS QUESTION! WHY DO YOU FOLKS MAKE "PULLED-PORK CHEESE FRIES" WITH _NO_ _PORK_ _AT_ _ALL_?!  it's a simple question, but you still will never answer?!<//review>< name>

I personally think this is the best bbq in Orange county. The service is always great and the food is always on point. I miss the beef ribs though.<//Review>

<Text>Blake's has the best BBQ in all of Southern California that I have tried. And I have tried a lot of BBQ places! The staff is always attentive, and treats you well. If I have a craving for BBQ, I will drive an hour from where I now live just to come here. It's that good.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Was going to eat here but the special on the chalkboard said $14.00 and the cashier refused to honor the posted price. He said its now $18.00. Really? And you could not fix that on a chalk board? Well, we left. Have never eaten there and now we won't.< /Review>

< Review>
So I Haven't been at Blakes in awhile. I decided to go in today. Once I received my food, I asked for a Hot Sauce I usually used to get. My Waiter brought it and I used it for my food. Half way through my meal, a customer came up to me, and asked if we were done using the sauce. I politely said no because I wasnt done using it and instead offered for him to take some on his plate. He said no, I could take some on my plate and he would take the bottle. I said no, Im still using the sauce I originally asked for. He walked away upset and sat on his table. A few minutes passed by and my waiter came by and asked if she could pore some into a mid size container. I said yes and she then headed to the customer that had asked me for the bottle of sauce. Another few minutes passed by and another waiter came by the name kathy. She said, "alot of customers are asking for this sauce, so i need to take it." I mentioned To her i was still using it. However, she took the bottle and walked away and gave the bottle to the other customer that had originally asked for it. I think Kathy could have handled this situation better and not show preferrence to other customers who are regulars. It was extremly rude. Due to this experience, i am rating this review a 0.< /Review>

Blake's Place is great. We had the BBQ chicken sandwich, very tender and juicy, BBQ sauce is delicious! The cob salad was huge with a whole half of an avacado, lots of cubed turkey and ham chunks, cheddar and provolone cheese, bacon and a whole sliced hard boiled egg and 2 slices of really good garlic toast. Highly recommend this BBQ Deli!<//Text>

<review>Oh man, I know I'm not a BBQ expert but I do know well made food when I try it and Blake's definitely is well made. The flavors of the different meats are amazing (my family shared pork ribs, baby back ribs, sausage, brisket, and BBQ chicken). All of them were tender, cooked to perfection. Either come with a big appetite or share plates. The coleslaw was probably the best I've ever had (which is saying something because my grandmother makes a killer coleslaw too). You can't go wrong at this place.</review>< resp>

<text>Being a carnivore I usually avoid places with foreign words like , non-gmo , organic and vegan options.

On a whim a coworker and I decided to stop by and give it a try.

Salads are insanely large with plenty of protein. Sandwiches are spot on. Soups are hit or miss.

Overall great place for lunch but not the most wallet friendly for the food. Kinda pricey.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>We've tried a lot of things from the menu and have never been disappointed. We've also catered 4 times and the food is always a crowd pleaser. If you cater the Mac n Cheese or scalloped potatoes side dishes, I like to doctor them up with garlic and onion powder.< /Text>< user_id>

there are few barbeque places this good out here. their brisket is phenomenal, and get their loaded fries while they are still carrying it. they often have a salmon-topped salad, and a couple soups of the day. they cater as well. while they're a little pricey, it is absolutely worth every penny.</Text>

Food is excellent and they have a separate dining area. The ribs are awesome.</Review>

<rate>3<//rate><review>Being a carnivore I usually avoid places with foreign words like , non-gmo , organic and vegan options.

On a whim a coworker and I decided to stop by and give it a try.

Salads are insanely large with plenty of protein. Sandwiches are spot on. Soups are hit or miss.

Overall great place for lunch but not the most wallet friendly for the food. Kinda pricey.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Friendly staff and great food. Portions are perfectly sized and priced right. Chopped brisket was great! I would certainly visit on my next trip to Anaheim. Takes about15 mins to get here from the resort area.< /Review>

Great service from start to finish. (6:20pm)It was me and my wife's first time here and we got the brisket sandwich and a side of beans. After ordering we sat down for a total of 7 minutes before they brought us our food. The brisket was great and the BBQ sauce was perfect. We were checked up on by one of the staff to see how the meal was going and asked if we wanted a refill. It was a wonderful restaurant like experience for a small location and the staff was extremely friendly<//Text>

<Review>Stopped by this joint for a quick dinner after a long day of travel and Disneyland. My niece and nephew loved the ladies working there who took the time to make them feel better - they were fussy after afore mentioned activity.

The food was awesome! Big servings that were still good for lunch right out of the fridge the next day.

I have told my family and we will all be back when we are in the area again.<//Review>< Rate>

Great service and good food! I grew up in San Diego and am a huge fan of Grand Ole BBQ y Asado, and Phil's BBQ. This place sort of reminds me of those two! Brisket is awesome and the ribs fantastic. I work down the street from them now, so I have to fight off the temptation to eat there every day!< /Text>

Great Brisket sliced or chopped, pulled pork, BBQ kielbasa sausage sandwich, WINGS (sweet chili my fav), garlic bread, baked beans. Friendliest staff. Even the cooks throw a smile and a wave.<//text>

3 year update: Still the wing king.

The Buffalo wings are a thing of beauty, all other wings are a pale imitation at best. They are all meat, no fat, smoked to perfection before being sauced, and served with ranch sauce so fantastic that you'll very likely ask for extra.

Overall the menu items are great, but the wings are truly exceptional.

I also recommend the brisket burrito.</text>

Good BBQ (for CA not Texas). Just a little pricey. Service is great and friendly. A business that cares. Ribs are the best<//text>

Food was pretty good, but portions were small and their carryout service seemed to lack the care you might get with sit down service. They didn't provide plates, BBQ sauces or utensils; all nice touches with carryout meals. it also seemed overpriced for what we got.<//text>

Now for the food, let me say it's my new favorite spot for bbq meat.  Going to try the rest of their menu the more i return,  and i sure will.

Decent ribs, but was expecting more smoky flavor and color. Really good sauces. Also, liked the slaw since it is not too sweet.<//text>

Very good contender but not one of the best.
I ordered the samplers, my tri-tip was a bit tough and still had the kerosene smoke smell lingering in the meat and on the french rolls, otherwise, the rolls were soft and fresh. The three meats looked really good until I detected the kerosene smoke.
I'm willing to give this place a second chance, may be I just had a bad piece of the meat.
Price is acceptable.< /Review>

I'm a fan.  Not the 'greatest' per say but still some really kind grinds.
I went with a friend and she recommended that I try the "Beef Brisket Sandwich" (sliced brisket, BBQ sauce, red onion and a sliced pickle on a French roll). @  $7.80
Instead I decided to order the "Pork Loin Sandwich" (sliced pork, BBQ sauce, onion, a sliced pickle on a French roll).@  $7.80
We split the Blake's Rings and French Fries combo: @ $5

So the experience we had was that this place was pretty crowded.  There was this guy sporting the coolest handlebar mustache; which I haven't seen in a long time. He took our order. We sat outside and our order came out rather quickly. The food runner was way nice and friendly.  While we were approximately half way through our meal another food runner going table to table asking about our experience.
Environment wise: Pretty cool: Plenty of seating inside and on the patio. TV's were set to sports channels and staff was super friendly.
Food wise: The  "Pork Loin Sandwich" was way to dry and I had to add BBQ sauce to help try and wet it up. Might've came in to order this on the wrong day.
Thank goodness I gave half of my sandwich to my friend and she gave me half of hers.  Her sandwich was GREAT!  I should've listened to her : /
The Onion Rings and French Fries were good.  The Onions rings were better since the fries came out a bit on the dry side and had to try and salvage them by the savior known as "Ketchup"

So here it is in a nutshell: Try the "Beef Brisket Sandwich"</review>

I'm not the BBQ authority or anything, but there was a little too much sauce mixed in with the chopped brisket for me. The chicken was pretty good with a smokey flavor though. Overall it was okay.</Review>

Fast food bbq... Food was warm... $ 21.00 for a two fatty bbq ribs and a small portion of appeard to be dry reheated brisket...

Fast service...but more of a blue collar take out place... Seating is clean...

Could of gotten better at a grocery store food stand...

Sad because of the good reviews.....thought the food would be fresh and Hot...< /review>

Traveling through the area and stumbled on this via Google, and what a find! Great brisket sandwich, extremely fresh sub roll, tasty sauce...only regret was getting it to go...should have sat and eaten, could have put on more sauce (extra supplied, but didn't want to make a mess in the car!).<//text>

<Text>Bbq was good, but the pros brisket and turkey all seemed to be the same...  It would be kinda hard to distinguish the differing meats...  The sauce is really good though so no complaints there and the portions are really filling! The cookies are so good and the apple cobbler dessert was ok but wouldn't buy that again...

Didn't get to meet Blake, but at least they don't charge extra for ranch. Five stars.</Review>

I love that this place took the initiative to open a second location as I assume the Anaheim location did well enough to merit expansion.  That's the only positive I have for Blake's following my second visit.  I will be sticking with Beachwood (seal beach), Baby Blues (venice), and Rancho a-go-go (orange) for my BBQ needs.  Images posted of my takeout order.< /review>

<Text>The Pulled Pork is exactly what it sounds like. It’s tender, slow-cooked, smoked pork that literally falls apart into shreds. They toss it in Blake’s BBQ sauce and serve it up in a lump. It has a little too much BBQ sauce for me. I’m more of a smoked meat person who uses the sauce on the side to add as needed. Otherwise, the pork tasted pretty good. Thumbs up!

Blake’s Big Pulled Pork Pile is slow smoked pork, pulled and served on their big bun with BBQ sauce, cole slaw, and red onion. You’ll definitely need extra napkins for this sandwich! Again, a little too much BBQ sauce for me, but my family loved this sandwich! The sweet, BBQ sauced smoky pork complemented the cool, creamy cole slaw. The bun was soft yet held this pork beast together. Thumbs up! If you’re feeling a bit of Man vs. Food hunger, they also offer the Blake’s One Pounder Bomber or “THE BEAST” (two and a half pounds of food, YIKES!)

Sandy’s Bread Pudding is a huge portion with a side of vanilla sauce to slather on. It was a very dense and custardy bread pudding. It had a bit more raisins in it than expected. The vanilla sauce was creamy and gave it a down-home comfy goodness. Thumbs up!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd68d971c2551:0x8da563562c17d50a< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I liked this place because it looks very clean the people are friendly very attentive and the place has a lot of ventilation, the food very tasty, what I liked is that they gave us a lot of salad and I like the salad it seemed very cheap, we ordered a Family pack like 5 people and we all ate very well Until we were full and we still had plenty to go.

Me gustó este lugar Porque se ve muy limpio las personas son amables muy atentas y el lugar  Tiene mucha ventilación, la comida muy rica, lo que me gustó es que nos dieron mucha ensalada y a mí me gusta la ensalada me pareció muy económico, pedimos un paquete  familiar como para 5 personas y todos comimos muy bien Hasta llenarnos y todavía nos sobró para llevar.<//Text>
