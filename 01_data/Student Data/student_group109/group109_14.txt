The manager who helped me and worked with me was wonderful. It was quick, and the office environment was great. I wanted to note that sitting in the office I was hearing conversations between the manager and other customers and he was absolutely wonderful with them. I will be going back here for my future services on my car.
Last thing I wanted to mention was that I felt supported, they explained what they needed to, they didn’t try to guilt me or trick me into buying anything extra. Overall great experience.<//Text>

<text>My daughter bought her tires here and highly recommended them. They do other services so I brought my car in for an oil change. Robert was very friendly and helpful and fully explained the service they provide. The service was quick and the follow-up call before I picked up the car was again explained well. I felt like my car was in good hands and a thorough job was done. I was very satisfied and he has a network for other automotive repairs they don't do which is very helpful.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>I was the first appointment for the day to get an alignment. The staff was professional, and they handled the job in under an hour as promised. The lobby was setup with social distancing in mind, and I felt completely safe while waiting. This is a great location to handle most of your cars needs. I drive several miles to get there, and this was my second visit. Two thumbs up, customer for life!<//text><Time>1616518126192</Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><userid>111378785128737051553< /userid>< GmapID>

I went to American Tire today and they were so kind & helpful.
I had a nail in my tire and Robert the Manager was great along with his staff.
Even though it was a small repair they treated me as if I had all new tires put on.
I will definitely use them when it is time to rotate and align my vehicle.<//text>

I visited American Tire Depot on a trip out to Thousand Oaks visiting family. I accidentally ran over a nail in my rental car and needed a quick tire patch. They were recommended by AAA and 2 different tow truck drivers and I see why! The guys at ATD were so quick, kind, and efficient! Not only that, but the tire patch was free of charge. I can't thank them enough for quickly getting my tire fixed so that I could enjoy the rest of the day with my family.< /review>

I have my Tesla model X serviced for four times at Thoudand Oaks American Tire Depot in the past few years. Twice for tire replacements  one time for flat tire service and another time for tire pressure check. It has been wonderful and no waiting service as appointment set. The manager and workers are all warm-hearted make you feel so welcome and appreciated to be there. The Q and A regardless in the store or on the phone, always reaches my satisfaction. I recommend strongly their service to anyone who needed without reservation and thank to all the workers in the store.</Text>

I have been patronizing American Tire Depot's Thousand Oaks store for about three years now, and have always been very happy with their work and with the value received.
Yesterday's visit was the best yet! Robert Padilla and his crew went 'above and beyond' to address every single need I had itemized!
I highly recommend ATD, Thousand Oaks, in large part due to Robert's supremely competent oversight and personable service.
ATD would be well-advised to do everything in its power to keep this widely-experienced and insightful manager very happy!</text>

I think you should buy all of your tires here.  The quality of the service, the pricing, and the selection is fantastic.  They have free tire inflation/inspection bays where you can just drive up.  I've had them rotate tires and replace on my Tesla M3 -- which you may not realize requires some special care when jacking up the car -- and they know what they're doing.  Very professional staff, they are a major asset here.<//text>

Price point, these guys are basically the best. And you'll be in and out within the hour. I'd recommend calling ahead for the quote. We thought about going to Costco, because there was a $75 off coupon, but there was so much additional fees. It's understandable though because Costco would patch up nails and stuff as long as you have those tires, but just to get the tires, this place is one of the best for your money.< /text>

Robert and his guys were great! They took care of an issue by replacement of the RV tire stems ....that could have turned really ugly if left undone and they did it ....spur of the moment .... on a Saturday afternoon.... when most places would not have want too!
Great job Robert!

The staff went out of their way to make sure my truck was done correctly as when they pulled old tires they noted I needed front brakes, this led to also turning the rotors, there was an issue with the right rotor bracket and they replaced that at no cost and the tires they recommended for my truck are great and what I wanted - my total cost including the brakes (not part of estimate) was STILL $200 LESS the the Firestone quote, and I got better tires.....They have won my family’s business<//Text>

<Text>They honored a promotional price stated, had friendly service, completed the oil change in about 30 minutes, and it was an overall great experience. Greg Andrew even recommended a tasty Mexican restaurant/market one block away for a delicious breakfast burrito. It was awesome. I sprung for the horchata also. Today was a good day.</Text>< userid>

The people that work at this shop, Greg in particular, go out of there way to be amazing and kind human beings. I had some small tire issues that were causing major issues for me, 20 minutes later- out the door no charge. I called Greg to ask for a reccomendation for a mechanic and he willingly and very kindly offered to help and gave me his mechaincs number. This crew and these people work hard, work honest and deserve your business. A++++</Review>

I blew a tire on the highway and wasn’t anywhere close to home. I called 6 other locations that all said they didn’t have my tire or couldn’t take me until the next day. I called this place as my last attempt and not only did they have my tire size they said come right in even though they were closing. I wish I remembered the guys name who helped me because he was so positive and kind and really made the experience less stressful! Thank you!</Review>

<review>Excellent Service - I called this morning to see if I could get my car in today.  Spoke with Greg. He was polite, professional and gave me confidence they could take care of my needs.

They took me soon as I arrived, assessed the issues with my car and had me out of there in a timely manner.  What I really liked was I thought I needed new brakes. But they were honest and said I did not need new brakes but just a minor fix. I also was due for an oil change and new wipers. All fixed at a reasonable price and quality work. I'd would highly recommend them.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The manager was super nice! My tire had a nail and they removed it right away! Took about 10 minutes! Awesome customer service! I will definitely be going back for my tire service needs!< /text></record>

Not only did I not need them done, it’s most likely malfunction in the ABS system. The store manager Greg advises me on just that. He also advised the my brakes were at approx 80% life left and looked great

Kudos to you and your team for being honest and upfront with me.

<review>DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SPOT IF YOU WANT QUICK,FRIENDLY,RELIABLE WORK AT THE LOWEST PRICES!!!!! This place is awesome! Super friendly down to earth yet very professional. The manager obviously deserves his title ! So I got treated like everyone else,places like these tend to try to manipulate women but not this place they got me great deal/prices! Everyone who works there were super cool, and they were patient cause I ordered tires and wheels and then didn't answer or show up for about a week & they continued to call to make sure I still needed them before they shipped them back and were not hostile about it either!!! So ya great choice and I love the wheels I chose they look great on my car!! Thank you guys \m/</review>< pictures>

Thanx Greg & Alex. After ordering tires online, I almost immediately received a call informing me that the tires I selected were not available. However, I was offered an alternate that had a longer warranty, for the same price. I was VERY appreciative of a same-day appt. I also needed an alignment, and they offered me their coupon price. I love coupons, and now American Tire Depot too.<//text>

<review>Had an amazing experience here. I bought my 2014 mini cooper s. The front and rear tires were mismatched and the camber was to negative in the rear. Picked the car up from these guys and it was like driving a completely different car. I'll definitely be back!< /review></record>

Greg was spot on with his assessment concerning our tire problems. His recommendations were made in our best interest. We saved overall on this buy, 36%, over the next closest estimate. Plus the team has excellent customer service skills. They've earned our business.</text>

Greg gave me a great deal on a set of Pirelli tires. He recommended an alignment as well, which I'm really glad that  I did.  My Audi A6 has over 105,000 miles on it, and now it drives like its brand new again!<//review>

<text>I had an amazing experience at American Tire Depot in Thousand Oaks today! Brett & Daniel helped me get an outstanding deal on my shocks for my truck. They also did an inspection and found that my sway bar links were broken and that I also needed tires! Brett made me a package deal for everything at a great price. Daniel the mechanic did an awesome job. Great guys here! I am a long term customer these guys do excellent work. I am completely satisfied!
Thanks you guys<//text><GmapID>0x80e83ab68580c645:0x68a890cc47d449d5< /GmapID>< Time>

Went 2 weeks ago to get a new set of tires. The price was unbeatable. No complaints about the price or the tire installation. My issue came with the oil change I got. Oil was overfilled too high for my liking and comfort. Brett the manager was great about draining and refilling to make me happy. He was great. I get home after they refilled the oil level to correct level and noticed oil dripping from under my truck. Popped the hood and see oil was spilled everywhere and poorly wiped up. Its been 2 weeks now and its still dripping a small amount. Happy with the tires but a little ticked about the oil change.< /text>

<Text>Brett the store manager, took care of my 2013 Mustang GT. I needed a specific tire and he was able to get one that very day and it was very short noticed so I didn’t expect to even get the work done that day, but Brett was able to make it happen. He was able to get his guys and have my car ready during my lunch which is an hour. He also topped my fluids off and inspected my car. He also recommended some things that my car needed for preventative maintenance. I live in Oxnard, but I would definitely make the drive out here to this American Tire Depot. Brett is a very honest manger and will definitely give you some good deals compared to somewhere else . I’m very satisfied.<//Text>< user>

However, getting information over the phone was an absolute nightmare! (Hence the 2 stars) I was quoted and told over phone for a set of 4 tires that was suppose to be ordered and delivered at store location the next Monday. The manager on site told me he would call me when they came in on Monday. I received no call and even attempted to call Monday to get info on the delivery. He said that he would try to figure out where my order went and told me again he would call me back. He did not. The next day, Tuesday; I received no call and waited for most of the day until I called in multiple times to get any information. I finally got a hold of the store which then proceeded to tell me that the tires had came in earlier that day. Then why wasn't I told so my car could get serviced? I felt like I had to do all the work to pay my way to get a set of new tires. Lots of places are looking for business and I feel that I was let down multiple times from this store. I will not be coming back in for future work to be done.</Text>< user_id>

<Text>Bait and switch shop on the buy 3 tires get one free deal. Even though the website shows available it might not be true. Also there are other costs not listed. And the roadside hazard program was pushed

Thanks for the reply. I don't know how to direct message you so I'll call the district manager.<//Text>< user_id>

American Tire Depot came highly recommended by a friend. I made an appointment with the manager, Brett over the phone and brought my car in the next day and it couldn’t have gone any better! They quickly diagnosed and repaired my car’s issues. I will definitely recommend American Tire Depot to anyone I know who needs tires (lowest price guaranteed), oil change, alignment, etc.
Brett’s a genuine guy who met and exceeded my expectations and really seems to look out for his customers!!<//text>

I highly recommend this place to anyone who's seeking superior customer service! I was in town for a quick trip and unfortunately landed a flat tire,  I was extremely concerned considering my tires usually have to be custom ordered since the majority of tire places don't carry this size tire on a daily basis, and my biggest concern was very few places have the machines to remove and replace the tire from the rim since the rim size is a 24". (They usually go up to a 20")
I called American Tire Depot around 10:00 am and spoke to Brett, I explained to him my situation in a panic and he handled the situation like a Boss. He made a quick call, ordered my tire and by 4pm had the tire there and ready to install,  not to mention he told me   that he checked and they did in fact have the proper machine to handle the 24" rim size.
When I arrived with my truck on a flat bed the guys in back had it in the garage in less then five minutes of it coming of the truck.  They were great as well,  everyone there had a positive and welcoming attitude,  they were professional,  efficent, and met all the specific accommodations needed to get the job done.
I was in and out of there in less then 45min to an hour.  Not only do they price match but already gave me the lowest price I've ever had on my tires.  I definitely give American Tire Depot as a business and the employees they have running the place a 5+ star rating.
Take any car year make or model there and you won't be disappointed.

I've bought tires from American Tire Depot for many years. Why? Honest, good prices,  good service. They won't sell you tires if you don't need them like other stores. That's why they are always my first choice.</Text>

Came here as I needed to replace my tires with something not too expensive since I only have a few months left on the lease and I knew they would not accept my worn tires upon return.
Gus the manager had me in and out in about an hour with a decent set of 4 brand new tires for less than the price of 1 Michelin tire. Yes I know the Chinese tires might not be the best but they have a decent tread wear pattern, temperature and speed rating. Hard to beat for the price.
Thanks to Gus I will be buying tires here again as I know he treated me fair and didn’t try and up sell me into something I didn’t need.< /text>

Great service and honest.   They don’t push on you anything else that you don’t need for your car, unlike most other mechanics.<//Review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>I purchased 4 new tires for my car.  I also requested that they check the TPMS function as my dash light was on, showing an issue with the tire pressure.  When the job was complete they said the TPMS light was now out.  Well, it was NOT out.  When I got home I checked the tire pressures myself and found the 4 new tires were inflated to 35 PSI instead of the recommended 32 PSI, and the spare tire was showing 26 PSI, so they obviously did not check anything.  After I adjusted all 5 tires to the correct pressure the Low Tires light went out.  This is too bad because they gave me a good price on the tires and were very likeable.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I had a pretty major repair job and I was almost ready to trade in my vehicle.   I found this place on google and they were able to repair my car for a very affordable cost. The crew was especially helpful and polite and they even gave me a loaner vehicle.  I will always recommend this place from now on.< /review>

Very honest good people that manage the shop, professional & they willing to work with you & give you fair prices. I changed my braks & my four tires & other things that my car needs badly, I did shop around but I found that this place is the best as far as honest & good shop that works with the community.
Am very happy & blessed I had such great experience today.

I was shopping the tire market for a set of Michelin pilot sport as/3 tires called ATD
And Gus answered I told him what I was looking for he asked if he  could call me back in 5 minutes while he checked price for me,
He called back we made a deal I brought the car in the next day Gus had Miguel start on my charger and within an hour the tires where mounted on the rims and the charger was ready to roll. Thanks Gus and Miguel these guys are good! I recommend ATD in Thousand Oaks Ca.</Text>

I have found my new Shop to visit when I need repairs or flushes of any fluid.

These guys were fast, efficient, and friendly. They had great knowledge on what was going wrong with my vehicle. They didn't try to confuse me with any type of Jargon that other places use to worry you about your vehicle.

Great prices too, I kept looking at their rates and they really are the best I have seen in town. Not steep but very reasonable.

I recommend going to American Tire Depot.</text>

Great service, best prices compared to others in the area. Everyone working there was very nice and very helpful. They explain things very well so you are not left in the dark about anything. After not being able to get my tire repaired due to it being a 2008 tire and too old to be legally patched (these guys also educated me on how to find the manufacture date on any tire) , I was quoted over $100 a tire at another place. Then the American Tire guys were able to find me a tire for $60 and I had it installed and after fees it was under $100. I have an oil change to get done soon and I think I will be giving them my business instead of Jiffylube! Thanks again for everything guys!</Text>

Well I’m upset here I have two back tires warrantee it with American tire Depot I took it into the
Thousand Oaks worked with Brent  after the vehicle was done the warning light was still on I took it into Brent telling me that after 50 miles driving that the light should come off
so again they took it to firestone tire because apparently they had the equipment to pressurize it and calibrate my vehicle correctly
Volvo is back fro Chapito taking it to Firestone and drove off again the warning light came on
I am now at Volvo Calabasas to get done correctly my concern is that I have a warranty with American Tire Depot and you do not have the equipment to work  my Volvo correctly
Sham on you for your employee having to cover what you should have to get the job done right 3 hours later it’s done.
Secondly I first bought this warranty in Downey,ca
I had to take the car back to get it pressurized again only to watch a mechanic trying to feed my mechanic that working on my vehicle Trying to feed him a banana a banana
Tony said he would sell me the tires for 445 the tire was not sold at price quoted   From than on I did not think much of Tony by that he was SNEAKY just to meet his company contest. VERY SAD OF YOU TONY
My Concern is I have 2 tires warranty by American Tire Depot that I have to watch closely and make SURE I AM LEAVING IN A SAFE CAR after there service.
BE WEAR TO ALL CUSTOMER OF AMERICAN TIRE DEPOT</Review>

<Review>I have never LOVED a business so much !!!! At the begining of the day I was furious because I had a second flat tire. My car is still new ! It came with Firestone tires which are, apparantly, the worst tires on earth. My car is still under warranty, but I've had two tires go flat, for tiny little reasons. I diverge.....so I though I was going to have to buy another new tire ( Firestone has NO warranty either ). Then I found out I could have it patched...day is getting better....both places I called quoted me $25.00 to patch it. On driving to one of those places I was about to pass American Tire Depot, so I swerved in with my credit card, ready to hand over my last $25.00 of grocery $, but they didn't want it. They patch tires for FREE. Also, they did it quickly and were super nice. I could then afford to buy lunch ( at a drive-through ) AND buy my dog a bag of food. Life is Good !<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
Great experience! Called on a Saturday and Robert was able to fit me in for the 4 tires I badley needed. He didn’t have the tires in stock but said he would make sure he’d make it happen as quickly as possible. Did some shopping with the wife and as we were heading back home Robert called and said the truck was ready! The 4 tires I wanted were installed and balanced at an unbeatable price (they price match). Very proffesional, very accommodating and very fast. If you need tires, brakes or fluid service do yourself a favor and go see Robert.< /Review>

These guys are great.  From simple stuff on my truck to more specialized work on my 911, there doesn't seem to be anything they can't handle.  The front office is friendly and easy to work with, the the techs are articulate and know what they're doing.  Pricing is excellent as well.

The flush-mount lift is a great plus if you have a low-slung car.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Incredible customer service, comfortable waiting room, always prompt service (finally, no endless waits!) the mechanics are knowledgeable, reliable and never try to add on services you don't need. I took my daughter's car to two other places before going to Performance Auto and got a huge laundry list of repairs that needed "my immediate attention" to the tune of $2,700. Took it to Performance and walked out with a perfectly running car for under $300. Do yourself a favor: go get two estimates, then go to Performance - you'll be a customer for life.<//text>< Pictures>

I would highly recommend Performance NAPA Auto Care.  It's a true pleasure to experience this family run business full of genuine people who really care about you and your needs.  I took my car in for a major service that was required --I didn't want to deal with the dealership and their inflated prices anymore.  Tim, Tom and everyone at Performance NAPA Auto Care couldn't have been more accommodating. Not only did they perform the required service, they were also able to help me with tires. They ordered what I needed, beat the prices that I had found, installed them, balanced them and I was good to go.  I'm glad to see that there are still honest businesses around.  I have recommended them highly to many of my friends.< /Review>

I needed to get my Infiniti ready for a long trip to Reno.  With 140,000 miles it was starting to get sluggish.  I turned it over to Tim and his crew and it now runs like it did when it was new.  Great performance.  I was considering getting a new vehicle since the G35 is now ten years old but that has changed.  Runs great so why trade.
Thanks to everyone at Performance.< /text>

<review>Ordered a replacement tire after my sidewall cracked. I was initially told that the tire would be available the next day, but they had a machine issue, and could not put the tire on the wheel for myself or any other customers that day. I returned the next day for my tire, to be initially told that the part for their machine was still not in. As I was leaving, a technician luckily stopped me and told me that my tire was, in fact, ready. Aside from the delay and the poor communication, it was a fine experience.< /review>< pics>

Napa Auto Care is very professional and honest. From the minute you walk in the door when they greet you till you leave they are friendly and will tell you exactly what  needs to be done to your car. I would definitely recommend their services.<//review>

<Review>Performance Napa Auto Care Center lived up to there name.  They were very professional in the way they treated me, and were very knowledgeable about the needs for my car, which is a Lexus.  They explained what service I needed and gave me a fair
estimate of the cost, the actual cost was even less.  The facility is very clean with modern equipment.  Knowing that quality Napa parts were being used was very reassuring.  I would recommend this place to all my friends and family.< /Review>< gmapID>

I was driving to Santa Barbara when I noticed my check engine light was on. I quickly pulled over and the first exit and checked for local auto repair and Performance NAPA Auto Care came up. I pulled in and talked to Tom and he had them do a quick computer diagnostic on my car and discovered my thermostat just went out. Within the hour they put in a new one and sent me on my way.

While so many auto shops are just out to make a quick buck the guys at Performance NAPA Auto Care really cared about my car, my time and my budget. If I am ever in that area again they will be my first stop before any other big trips.

Thanks Tom and Tim</Review>

Before leaving on a road trip, I took my 15 year old Explorer to Performance NAPA Auto Care. I was concerned that I would have to rent a car for this trip but after the expert service at Performance NAPA Auto Care my vehicle ran perfectly & we had a wonderful trip.  Thank you to Tim, Tom & the guys at Performance NAPA Auto Care.</text>

<Text>Over the past 20 plus years I have had the mis-fortune of getting slammed by other poor drivers, but have been fortunate to know of a very excellent auto body shop in Ventura. Once again in April, 2021, my LR3 suffered with crunched drivers-side front fender. My insurance company, like most, moved rather slowly and attempted to "cheap-out" on the parts and scope of work. Lucky for me Scott handled my insurance company like a Boss. Scott did not except their cheap approach to "restoring" my Rover to new. I am STOKED again ! ...

Top-notch service from TNS.  Scott repaired a spot on the hood where clear coat had stripped off and went ahead and buffed out scratches all around the car for good measure.  Price was exactly what he quoted and was done on time, even during the holidays.  Hood looks perfect as does the rest of the bumper and panels where he got rid of all the little scratches.  Love the personal attention to detail that you just don't get at a high throughput franchise body shop.< /Text>

I scratched the front bumper of my car and the side came unattached. This was the only auto body shop open on a Sunday. Because I live in Santa Barbara, he was extremely helpful on the phone to diagnose the parts I will need to order to fix my car without me driving all the way out there.  Highly recommend! Planning on taking my car here to get fixed once the parts come in</review>

This place is amazing! Scott has been working on my Toyota Scion XB for many years and I am always so pleased with both the service and the price! Years ago Scott painted my car flat black and it came out amazing, at a very reduced price just because he wanted to help me out and make it possible for me to get it done affordably. He has repaired my back hatch door handle for half of what the dealer was going to charge me for parts and labor. Then recently the mechanism broke which latches my door after 16 years of usage from the time the car was built and makes it power lock; it wasn’t locking anymore and I needed to have it repaired to the tune of over $600 at the dealer! I called Scott, he responded immediately, ordered the part for me for half the cost, and reduced the labor fee. I was able to save a lot of time and money having him do the work and can now lock my car again.
One time my son’s bumper fell off and Scott secured it for him at no cost just because that’s who he is. Helpful and generous.
He always goes out of his way to make his customers satisfied and happy, which I and my family for sure am.
Thank you to Scott and TNS Auto Body Refinishing! 😊 🚘</Text>

I had my car repaired here 1.5 yrs ago. Recently I hit a curb and my bumper popped out a bit. I called Scott and he had me come right over. He fixed it right away and refused to charge me. I would highly recommend this shop!!!<//Review>

Scott is terrific! I have gone to see him twice now and most recently was after I bumped into a pole at the drive up ATM and popped out my front bumper! He’s my “go to guy” for auto body work big and small,  and I really appreciate him!</text>

<review>The owner, Scott was great to work with. Made the arduous process of having my car repaired as pleasant as it possibly could have been. Scott already knew the claims adjusters from the different insurance agencies, helped coordinate that as well as get me a number for the nearest rental car agency to pick me up. He was very responsive, sent pictures of the car as he was working on it and overall did a great job. I will definitely go back to T & S if I need more repairs done on my vehicle.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

My cousin recommended me to Scott for some repair work on my 2013 f250. I could not be happier with his recommendation. his price was fantastic, better than anywhere else I had gone too. He truly cares about his work and worked with me and my busy schedule. He worked quick and the result was fantastic. Scott is a great guy who has an amazing talent. Go to him for all of your auto body repair needs. Thanks Scott< /Text>

Scott is awesome. I took in a sedan with a basketball size dent on the rear bumper and he left it better than new. We were concerned a whole new bumper would have to be purchased but he was able to seamlessly shape it back to normal. Scott even painted some extra nicks and scuffs we didn't mention and returned the car sparkly clean with a wax finish. He completed the job 2 days ahead of plan so that was very convenient. I can go on and on but to sum it up our experience was 10/10. Thanks Scott!!< /Text>

Scott and his team are the best!  They treat every customer as a friend.  Scott is honest, reliable, works quickly and does amazing work.  He has done body work on my truck 3 times now over the years, and each time he makes it look perfect.  I will never trust anyone else with my repair work. I am so glad that my family has Scott to trust our cars with.  You won't be disappointed.< /Review>

<text>Someone backed into my car in a busy parking lot around Christmas. This caused about $2,700 damage. I took it to TNS Auto Refinishing, and Scott (the owner) got me in right away, and did a fantastic job repairing the car. It came out looking brand new, he even expertly matched the pearl white paint job. I wouldn't consider having anyone else do body work on my cars.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Scott worked on the passenger door of my car after a minor accident. He did a superb job in a timely fashion and charged me a reasonable price.

I appreciated his honesty and reliability. He is personable as well as professional in his work.

I had several opportunities to watch him work on cars and have seen the results. He is very precise and takes pride in his work.

I decided to have my whole car painted by him.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Well, I didn't think all of the 38 people posting positive reviews  before me could be bought off, so gave Scott a try.  Also I'm not not one to post reviews much at all - but here I am.  Here are the facts.  An Estimator for an insurance company whose name starts with a P, and who seems to be getting Progressively bigger and Progressively less behind their customers came out to T&S to do an estimate for repairs.  Scott fought to get dealer parts versus the cheap aftermarket junk the estimator wanted to put on my car.  Then the adjuster wanted to cut short the days for the repair (they were paying for a rental for me while my car was getting fixed) and so tried to force 2-stage paint on my 3-stage paint car.  Scott argued on my behalf on both of these counts, eventually hanging up on the adjuster (later confirmed by the guy himself!).  Long and short, after some arguing myself, the Estimator Progressively came around and Scott got the right parts for the car.  They went above and beyond with some little extras not even covered by the insurance company.  Very pleased with Scott's shop and his service.< /text>< pics>

He painted my truck and did a great job. When it came to the warranty of the paint job he back peddles because he doesn’t make money on warranty work. Telling me stories that his landlord is gonna sell his building yet he is still painting cars. Professional? A real pro would back up their work and make it right.<//review>

Scott did a great job repainting my rear bumper. I reversed into a boulder and scraped the bumper pretty bad. Scott's price was great, work was done on time, and great results. Good experience all around. Thanks Scott!</review>

<Text>Scott is so helpful and talented. His attention to detail gives me great comfort bringing in a vehicle for paint and light body work. Scott works well with the insurance companies. Recommend this shop.< /Text>< date>

<Text>The best auto body and repair shop I have ever been to!! They do it right the first time, the pricing is amazing and the service is outstanding! First,  I brought my car in for something fairly small, it was on a Sunday and Scott just happened to be there told me to bring it by. He took time out of his already busy schedule to take a look at the damage, figure out what would be the best way to fix it and he actually fixed it there on site, right away. We also took our Acura there to be repaired and repainted, they did such a great job. There are a few dents in the bumper, they completely took them out, replaced a couple of pieces that needed replacing. We now use them exclusively and recommend them to everybody, my mom takes her car there, all of my friends. They are the best whether it's collector cars, every day drivers or small fixes!<//Text>< Pics>

Scott(the owner) has taken care of our family twice. Once with an accident repair and just recently with a door repair . The match of paint, and the quality of the accident repair was flawless. Most recently fixing the door was a bear of a job. Scott did not give up until he solved the problem. I will recommend his shop to all my friends and family.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I needed to get a few door dings and bumper repairs done on my Mazda car thanks to people "generously" hitting my car and not letting me know. I went by and spoke with Scott the owner. He seemed knowledgeable and gave me a great quote. He did the job as advertised and finished the day he promised. It was a fairly quick turn around. It only took 5 days for me to get it back. I definitely recommend him if you want great work at a fair price. It's never fun dealing with this type of chore but Scott made it as easy as possible.

My only remark to improve his service is in the details. He preferred me to pay via check but I needed to pay via credit card which he gets charged for (cost of doing business). I said I'd split the difference to help him out but this type of detail should be told up front to avoid the awkward discussion at the end. Also the rubbing compound used during the final buff was not completely removed. I went over my car afterwards with a fine tooth comb and had to buff off quite a bit of the rubbing compound in the little cracks, my emblems and down at the bottom of the car. I also found and peeled off a bunch of masking tape from under the car which was used to hold plastic to cover my car while he sprayed the parts he was repairing.

This all being said he did a good job. I did get a solid discount compared to some other quotes so I can't truly complain. I'm always a believer in you get what you pay for. So these minor details I can let slide but it would help the overall experience for his customers.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>I don't typical write reviews.  But then again, T&S  is not your typical auto body repair shop - it is bar none, the top auto shop in Ventura County. Old school professionalism with new school results and the best prices to boot. I took my Toyota Tundra into Scotts shop and received professional service minus all the lip service. If your looking for a quality shop with people who will treat your vehicle as their own - T&S is the auto body shop for you.</Text><name>Sylvia Hollis< /name>< userid>

I brought my car to TNS Auto Refinishing because the paint on my 1968 Barracuda was very dull. Scott advised me the car needed to be color sanded and then buffed out. I thought for sure that it needed a paint job wow was I wrong. The car was glowing and the depth of the shine was fantastic! Scott is definitely the paint KING!< /review>

TNS Auto Body Refinishing did a great job on my car. I was rear-ended in an accident this Thanksgiving and the owner, Scott, helped me through the entire repair process. After the insurance company under-quoted the repair cost, Scott was able to help make the corrections to ensure my car was repaired properly. TNS Auto Body Refinishing also ensured that I had a rental car as a replacement. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful and professional. Scott even personally stayed after hours several times to accomodate me. I highly recommend TNS!<//text>

Nobody at this store location wants to work. None of my questions were answered and no issues were resolved after months of dealing with T-Mobile’s unwillingness to port my number over to a new carrier even though there are about 10 employees working there. John, specifically, was no help and rude. Gave me the 1-800 customer service number to call and said “good luck”. Very dissatisfied with the company as a whole, not just this location. I shouldn’t have to drive around to different locations begging someone to help me with something as basic as porting a number over.< /text>

This TMobile would not allow shipping to their store. I live far from work and the rep at this store told me if my phone arrives at their store, they would just sell it along with their other inventory. Very very poor policy, bad customer service.<//text>

I don't usually make comments in Reviews . However, the workers in this store is TERRIBLE. I went to ask them about a phone (Samsung S20) that came out recently just confirming some specs or more information. The worker I was with walked with me to the phone to see 3 advertisement of that phone that could be found from tv or the internet just realizing it has "amazing features". I'm shocked to see a worker not knowing their own new product. They are UNPROFESSIONAL and  UNKNOWLEDGEABLE.<//review>

If I could give a negative start I would. I hate this place, everytime I go in it's at least an hour of wait time. This time I only needed to buy a sim card, they told me they had 3 people on front of me, so I said ok I'll wait. I timed it, I was waiting 28 minutes and still there was 2 people ahead!! SERIOUSLY? Couldn't you take 2 minutes to sell me the sim card and I'd be in my way out? Worst customer service ever. I'm taking my business somewhere else<//Text>

Terrible service management needs to be replaced. I who was a Manager for Sprint & Att&t know how customers should be treated especially if your sales are based off a rank of how you performed and how satisfied the customers are with the service. My husband went in to pay a bill waited 1 hr and still hadn't been seen. No I'm sorry or t get thank you for being patient .we will not going back to this store again.< /review>

Walked in and 3 of the female employees looked at me. Not once did they say we'll be right with you or welcome. Nothing! Waited 10 minutes and still nothing.  There were 3 customers and 6 employees so, I don't get the having to wait.... this isn't the first time this happens at this T-Mobile location!</text>

<text>They answer the phone and hang up without saying a word. Even if it's busy... how hard is it to say "we're really busy, do you mind holding for 10-15mins or would like to try back later?" If you can't handle the heat get out the kitchen... or jump into a McDonald's  kitchen were you couldn't possibly be as terrible.< /text><time>1455820186344< /time><rating>1</rating>< Response>

<Review>Horrible Customer service, they did the "welcome to T-Mobile". didn't even look up or at me. and that's no big deal. I proceeded to wait 30 min w two associates working, 2 other customers there. one talking about  vacations and other small talk lil jokes..bullshit. . as I proceeded to wait. never once did they stop and ask why I was i there? how they could help?  its Simple questions  or just letting me know it will be a few more minutes​. just aknowlgment and courtesy of someone's time, makes a huge difference in customer service!
I know it's an Authorized Dealer certainly hope, the owner of that store is well aware. who's working for him. not to mention I could see a worker in the break room, just sitting watching what sounded like a TV.. This store was surely moving in Slow motion for a Tuesday morning. The elderly person behind me was upset too, he was waiting  to make a payment.. Please don't be afraid to multitask over there..</Review>< user_name>

<review>Setup an appointment online for 11am today.  Came to the store and didn't know they opened at 11 so sat in my car and waited 5 mins.  Walked to the store at 11 on the dot and still closed even though the lady was there getting cash register prepared.  Waited until 11:02AM and doors still locked.  Walked back to my car and as I was backing out the lady finally open the door.  Thanks but no thanks, my time is important to me and I expect you to be open at 11 and not at 11:04am, especially when I setup an appointment online.<//review>< Pictures>

Absolute horrible service, I go in tonight for a charger for my galaxy note 5.
Apparently they sell the phones but they don't sell chargers....complete BS!! I asked the gentlemen if they had a charger that would fit or be compatible and he said no...which is complete BS!!! Never again will I go to this store!!</Review>

Kimberly Joy was absolutely wonderful and great to work with! She was so helpful and attentive! Had a great conversation with her while we were setting up my phone! After a couple of frustrating experience earlier in the day, Kimberly helped me get my phone and   Made it a fun experience!</Text>

<text>KimberlyJoy was the most friendly, knowledgeable Verizon rep I have encountered. No question I asked was too much trouble for her to answer or demonstrate for me. She is an asset to the Verizon brand and I would return to any store where she is working within a reasonable travel distance.<//text>< username>

<Review>I was notified when my phone arrived. I came in to get it set up and the staff was very quick and efficient, they politely requested another browsing customer to wait their turn since I was there first and took care of me.

I received excellent customer service from Jennifer M., the manager, when I upgraded my phone yesterday.

She was very patient and thorough in explaining all the new features of my new phone, plus, helped me transfer all of my pictures from my old phone to the new model.

The ultimate multi-tasker, she also helped several other customers who came in, while my phones were still exchanging data, with her efficient and pleasant manner so people were not just waiting around.

I see promotion to Regional Manager happening in her future, this is what true and great customer service is all about - highly recommend!</Text>

Highly recommend this Verizon Dealer. Great customer service, especially Eve and Katelyn!
They take time to answer your questions and look up info they might not have immediately at hand. Always feel cared for as a customer.</Text>

I casually reached at the store to enquire about porting my number from another Service Provider to Verizon and trust me, I was able to complete the whole procedure in short period of time with no issues. I was explained so well about the process and time in advance. I got all the information as requested. I had one word to say about Kaitelyn who was the staff person supported that she was very humble, soft spoken and gave all the time customer needs for the first impression. These people deserves credit for what they do in their day to day life at work. They represent these big companies and some are really serious about their job, company and their customers. She is among them. Well done.< /text>

Bought a phone here last year, no problem but if you ever need some technical help or stop by with a question as I did (they were not busy), the only store representative there was not friendly, did not really want to engage in helping me, was very condescending, and just rolled her eyes like, "another old person to deal with" type attitude.  Don't think I'll buy another phone at this store for above reason.  Good customer service and attitude can go along way but not today!<//Review>

This was my second time coming to the store. I was here yesterday but the store was closed and hand written sign says “will be back in 30 minutes and nobody show up even after 50 minutes’. So, I came back yesterday to re activate my SIM card, waiting after 30 minutes, I finally decide to leave the store, because the dark skin girl was taken for ever with a customer. Horrible place.<//Text>

I am extremely happy with my experience at the store.  Peter was the gentleman who helped me.  He was so courteous with me, and oh so patient. He explained every detail on the differences of the phones that I was interested in updating to, and every detail of the differences in the insurance plans.  He was not pushy at all...just helpful.  As others mentioned in their evaluation, this store is not jam packed with people.  I left with a big smile on my face.  Thank you Peter!< /Text>

The big problem for me is they have misplaced my old phone and lost my Extra memory card, that had pictures that meant alot to me that looks like are now gone, such as pics of my Granny that is no longer alive, and pics of my granddaughter at birth and after, I have shown extreme patience with this place, in trying find my property they have lost, they have shown me No Integrity or resolve, In getting to the bottom of this matter in fact I don't know how a place like this stays open, with this type of service, it's is like someone working on your car but losses it I. The process of them working on it. Amazing, good luck if you choose this place.< /Text>< pics>

I am disappointed, standing in front of this store at 6:42, 20 mins before they close, and the door outs locked, open sign is off, and they are in there just staring at me when I tried to go in.
Pretty lame if you ask me. I was here to buy phones for me and my wife.
Now I will shop elsewhere.< /text>

< Review>
Christopher not only gave me an excellent deal on fixing my macbook, he was also able to repair my sister's iPhone and get me the new iPhone 8! I did not anticipate on buying anything, however it is great to know that there is a reliable, local repair store that also provides verizon! Great service!<//Review>

This store is excellent. They have amazing patience solving problems. Xochitl sold the phone to me and was very patient and thorough and later helped me with the rebate on my phone as there were technical difficulties related to my old iPhone. I highly recommend this store.<//Text>

I had a terrific experience at the store with employee Justin Fairchild. I had a Galaxy 8 for a total of 15 days when out of the blue it died on me. No explanation for it. I went to BestBuy where I bought it and they promptly told me it was out of the 14 day window, no refund/replacement. So they referred me to Samsung customer service 800 number. What fun that was.  They told me they had no loaner phone or replacement phone for me, that it would be 9 to 11 business days before it would be serviced and back to me. As most people, I use my phone for work, for everything! There is no way I can be without a phone for 2 weeks. I was frustrated almost to tears but then I thought maybe my carrier - Verizon-  can help. I noticed there was a local store near me. I went in and was helped by Justin and he was wonderful. He lent me a loaner phone without charge and even helped set it up. Very courteous with excellent music of his playing overhead :-) Thank you so much, it meant a lot to me in a time of need.<//text>

<Review>Friendly staff. They want to help. I took my phone to get a cracked camera lens fixed. They fixed the lens for a decent price ($50) but ended up damaging the camera sensor.  They offered to repair for free but were unsuccessful so I ended up having to buy a new phone.<//Review>< Rating>

<review>Great experience, I came in to ClickAway concord , to switch from Sprint to Verizon. Not only am I getting the best cell phone company and converge, but I got the best costumer service, between Teddy Richeson, Xochiti Abonce and all the staff, they helped me get everything I wanted in switching to Verizon. Teddy helped me with all the amazing promotions Verizon and Samsung are giving, we switched 5 lines to Verizon and pre-ordered 3 Samsung galaxy S8 and 1 Samsung  Galaxy S8 + with the free VR coming with all 4 devices, and 2 of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ Teddy helped us get them for 15$ a mouth with trade in of our old phones, and the unlimited plan. If that was not enough he got us the promotion that Verizon will pay off our existing contract with Sprint to switch to Verizon, and even waive the 30$ connection fee. Teddy also gave us a great deal to fix my wifes broken screen. I would advise everyone to consider getting ClickAway phone protection plan. Thank you ClickAway Concord, everyone should come to you. I Will be getting all my phones through you now.

We absolutely love this place! Great beer, hard seltzer, and sours, and it is dog friendly!! The food is delish. You must try their black garlic shrimp (actually order two...because we always order one, then a second, ha!). I have tried the Korean hot wings (delish, and you get a ton), grilled cheese bread bowl (my daughter looooved it). Go support this local small business.</Text>

There's even a limited kid's menu. My son was thrilled with chicken fingers, fries and milk. (Most breweries don't have milk, so this was a huge win.)

There was ample outdoor seating, spaced. It felt safe enough.

It got backed up quickly as the crowds filled in, so closing out the tab took longer than it should have. But people were enjoying their beer and food, so it means they are doing something right..

I'm pretty positive this will be in our regular rotation, especially because we can grab a beer and lunch before grocery shopping at Sprouts.< /review><rating>4</rating>< Resp>

Great burgers but they should REALLY open at 1130am NOT noon. Too rushed, they needed 2 registers open,  long line, wait... but worth it! Excellent pretzels!< /review>

<review>I am a fan of their original location in Vista. We met one of the owners quite some time ago at Roueler and he recommended we check them out. we’ll often go to their Vista location but with what’s going on they probably weren’t open. But then we saw this location and it was open with food, and closer to our house. The place is in one of those Carlsbad new looking shopping plaza. They have an outdoor patio but it was super hot to sit out. Needed some more shading outside. Dog friendly on the patio. They were nice enough to let us sit inside and our dog half outside. We ordered the Korean hot wings and some fries. The wings were good, and I love the pickles on it- felt really authentic Korean... portion was a bit too small for price though. Fries were good. Next time we’ll try some of their real food like burgers. The beers were pretty good. I liked my double IPA. And I got a gose, which was okay. Definitely a cool spot to come, glad they opened here.<//review>< Pics>

Wow this place is amazing!!!!! Excellent beers, the food is to die for! I will drive here from anywhere for this tasty spot! Beer flights, pints, dog friendly, excellent service, outdoor dining, great taste in music, the vibe passes as a A+. I’m going to try to come here once every two weeks just to support. The staff was happy to be here, almost as much as I was! I was here on a Tuesday! Honestly the best choice to go! Thank you to the owners, staff, brewers, and the Chef I had a pleasure of speaking with, Gunnar. Your beer is top notch! Patio heaters! I was full, but I couldn’t spot ordering it’s all so delicious!!!!< /Review>

Great place for beer and food! We stopped in for a few tasters before our table was ready at a neighboring restaurant, and ended up coming back when our reservation was messed up. We were not disappointed!! The service, food, and beer were excellent. We had the mac-n-cheese, pretzel, loaded fries, wings, and apple pie. Everything was delicious. The wings, in particular, were my favorite. There service was some of the best I've had in a long time. We will definitely be going back!</review>

Just enjoyed a great evening out here post Covid. Every attention to detail for safety and sure felt great getting out. Loved all the dishes with the new chef! The meat pies were very flavorful and the mac cheese was delicious! Enjoyed some wings that are a special treat. What unique flavor! The beers are great and enjoyed the seltzer. Very friendly staff. Give this place a try. We're going back to see the "golden noodle" award.....ask the chef!</text>

<Text>I cannot express how excited I became when I realized the business next to Yoga Six would be a tasting room and eatery!

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>First time trying the place out and took it to go , the Apple turnover I received had burnt Carmel throught made it inedible. Trashed it, The crawfish "pie" 🥧 looked like an empenada. Only thing good were the fries. The bacon mac wasn't anything special,  didn't taste like bacon at all. Luckily I tried this place with a Groupon so I didn't have to completely waste my money. I'll just stick to pizza port if I'm in the area.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>We'd heard great things and we loved Ebullition's brewery, so we finally checked out Ebullition's gastropub. It exceeded all of our expectations. We started with the pretzel (which we'll get every time), Korean hot wings (perfect amount of heat), and the chef's new brussels sprouts with pork belly appetizer that our server recommended. I guess there's two appetizers we'll get every time. Amazing!

We paired this with the west coast style Dopamine double IPA and 65 and Sunny single IPA. Excellent hop-forward beers without overwhelming the palate.

For main dishes we enjoyed the burgers (another go-to) and both the seasoned fries and truffle fries (yum), the Reuben sandwich (watch out DZ Akins) and the crawfish chowder pie which was flaky, creamy and another surprise winner. The chef even came by the tables to inquire about our food. This place clearly cares about the quality of their beer and food.

With the main dishes we mixed it up with the Toucan Tart which was fruity and perfect on a warm evening. Our server suggested a neapolitan which is a blend of their Vanilla Porter and Strawberry Honey Pale Ale. This should be on the menu and we should have grabbed a crowler of this. Perfect beer to wrap up our first dinner at Ebullition Brew Works and Gastronomy.

Staff is friendly and knowledgeable, ambience is great, and the food is amazing.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Wanted to love this place as I live nearby, but I probably won't go back. Had a beer flight, 3 were below average, including one of the most boring hazy IPAs I've had, but the DIPA was decent. Service was very slow, but friendly. Seemed understaffed. Just had some snacks, which were OK, but can't really speak much to the food. Kind of cold on the patio as our heaters weren't working. So many great brewery options in the area, this one just doesn't stand out.<//review>

Best EBW.\n\nThanks for letting us know what you thought Mike. We’re definitely sorry we didn’t live up to your expectations. We are currently soft opened and working out the kinks as well as making changes to the menu. I would ask that you give us another chance to make things right. We are a family owned and operated brewery and take every criticism into consideration and would love to host you again and see if we can find some beers that you like as well as what you don’t like about the others. Being a local, we definitely want you to be happy, as we would like to become a positive part of the local community. My name is Erik, and I am one of the owners. My cousin Jesse is another owner, and if we could sit down with you and discuss a little more in depth what you are looking for or what you feel was missing, that would be great. Feel free to ask for either of us or for Jake, the GM. We really look forward to hearing from you! Cheers!\n\nErik'}</response>

< Review>
Amazing burgers. I ordered a well done Ebullition Burger. It was very soft for a well done burger which is a first. Fries were delicious well seasoned. I haven’t ate in person but had it delivered. Will definitely have to check them out in person.<//Review>

Convenient and easy appointments scheduling. Accurate cost estimate for work performed. Video replay of multi point inspection was useful and informative. Road force balance resolved ride issues. Overall experience was very positive.</Review>

This is a great dealership with exceptional service. I don't even live in Lake Tahoe but was lucky enough to discover these guys through online car shopping. Their prices are great and the staff is not pushy at all. Everything was almost too good to be true, so I waited a few months after buying my truck to write this. Well, the truck is still great and I can recommend this place with confidence. Shout out to Mark for great service.< /text>

Thanks so much for your hard work and efforts in finding the perfect car! The staff was very friendly and Mark Shehadi did a great job in communicating with me about what I was specifically looking for. I highly recommend going to this dealership.</review>

<review>Great assistance with purchasing a RAV4--with most interaction via email or text.  I felt the sales rep (Mark) heard my interests and needs and didn't try to work me over on something I was not interested in.

I have negotiated prices on cars online before, and hate when I get to the dealer and they still take forever and try to sell me things I don't want, need, nor which I expressed any interest in online.  This absolutely did not happen at Jim Bagan Toyota-- easy experience.

Good price.  Good service.  Support a small dealer who cares!<//review>< gmapID>

Very professional, caring and thorough with every detail concerning my car. They have even picked up my car while I was at work. I love the inspection video they sent. It showed me exactly what is right or wrong with my car. Even the mechanic came out to talk to me. The sales lady was very caring and thorough. The owner even came out to talk to me, very caring concern for my cars issues. Jim Bagen Toyota is the best experience I have ever had with an auto shop! I highly recommend this place for all of your auto needs!<//Review>

< review>
The best experience ever purchasing a vehicle!  Extremely easy to work with--just ask for Wayne Lovejoy!  All communication done over e-mail and phone.  Wayne and his team delivered the car to my door (~81 mile drive), AND had my gas filled to the top.  Best of all, you cannot beat the price of their vehicles!  I bought a tacoma and they made it possible with my budget!  I can't recommend these guys enough!  They literally go the distance for their customers!  Shop around, but you most likely will come back to Jim Bagan Toyota. :)<//review>

They all took care of me and my needs from the moment I submitted my vehicle request.  I purchased a 4Runner for my wife. They noticed a SMALL defect on my vehicle prior to me getting there and they brought it to my attention immediately, I wouldn’t even have noticed it myself.  They found the same vehicle with a little more on it almost right away and rectified the situation.  I will definitely be buying my next vehicle through them.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1616179774086, 'text': 'Congrats on your new 4Runner, Jonathan!

JJ and Mark were efficient, professional, and personable. I appreciated working with them after my experience with two local Toyota dealers. No muss no fuss car buying is what everyone deserves and these two delivered! I have already recommended them to other friends looking for a new Toyota.</Text>

My husbandI bought a Rav4 hybrid from these guys. Its too early for a comment on the car but the dealership was good. Definitely worth the drive up from Reno. They didn't play all the games trying to squeeze every last nickel out of you that you see in the bigger dealerships in Reno.<//Review>

Our experience at Jim Bagan was amazing!  They showed tremendous patience with us as we took the time to decide what the right thing was for us to do.  They were always responsive and respectful of our time.  I would say that this is the complete opposite of what we experienced with our more local dealership when trying to make the same purchase.<//Text>

<review>Just wanted to share that we had a great experience with Jim Bagan Toyota.  The team that helped us get our new car (Toyota RAV4 plugin) was fantastic.  Mark did a great job with our order, walking us through the car and even called us when we returned home to see if we had any questions.  Jin Jung the finance manager was clear, concise and prepared -- best experience ever getting a contract signed!  The person detailing the car (who I didn't catch his name) was cheerful and informative.  Overall, highly recommend the dealership.  We drove 5 hours to deal with the team and they did not disappoint!</review>< Response>

100% satisfied! It is rare to find dealerships that treat their customers this good. I am glad that I drove for five hours to buy my 2021 Tacoma here. Mark S. was courteous and very responsive. He walked me through the entire truck before I left the lot. Jin in finance was prepared, quick, and efficient. Thank you all for treating me so nicely.

<text>Although everyone was pleasant to deal with, my 4Runner was returned to me twice saying that my heating problem had been fixed when in fact it had not been. The first time I had picked up my 4runner I did not even have heat leaving the lot. The second time the heat worked for a few hours and then only worked at high RPMs. At this point I have little to no heat at all. I contacted Toyota USA with my experience and was given a case number and told a manager would contact me, that never happened. Debbie in the service department and Lee the mechanic were very helpful and understanding. Although overall I am disappointed that the dealership was not able to properly diagnose my problem and returned my vehicle to me twice claiming it was fully repaired.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1610744586759, 'text': "Hi Garrett, I am sorry to hear about your experience at our dealership.

< Review>
My process was fantastic! Was done all over the phone from an internet search and they had the truck I was looking for. The price I was quoted from another dealership in San Diego that had the same truck, who was marking it way up from sticker, was a giant discount! All the people on the phone were friendly and helpful. Its great to do business with an off the beaten path Toyota dealership in South Lake Tahoe and they crushed their competitors. I 100% will buy from them again and refer other people there.< /Review>

<Text>I purchased a Tacoma from this dealership a week ago, and the experience was nothing short of outstanding:
1) The initial communications via email were professional, and my questions were answered quickly;
2) The salesman took a lot of his time to explain the vehicle's features, answer my questions, look for all potential pricing discounts, and guide me through  the purchase process;
3) The financing and other paperwork was completed very quickly, and I was able to leave with the vehicle without any wasted time.
The best part was that there was no pressure to buy the vehicle or any add-on services.  On top of that, their price was much lower than the competitors that I checked with.  I would certainly do business with them again, and I appreciated their their professional, honest, and no-pressure approach!< /Text>< user_name>

I had a great experience purchasing my new vehicle from Jim Bagan Toyota in South Lake Tahoe. They were able to work a deal to get the exact payment I wanted and features I liked on the vehicle.  After working with Carson Toyota for weeks without coming to a deal I had my deal and was out the door in less than an hour and a half.  Thanks to my salesperson Mark and finance guru JJ.< /review>

<text>I just purchased a 2020 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road and it was the best buying experience I’ve ever had. Wayne is an amazing sales rep. I walked in with a list of requirements I was looking for in a Tacoma, he was able to find the one the best fit my needs, answered all of my questions, and basically made the experience wonderful. When the truck arrived at the lot, the finical paper work was a breeze (I think I was the one being a jerk reading the whole contract. Ha! Ha! Ha!) and Wayne took the time to walk me through everything the truck had and how to operate it. Next time I’m back in town and the trails are open I plan to take Wayne out to off road trip the use the crawl mode. Its going to be amazing!</text>< Pictures>

Hands down the best car buying experience I have ever had. Just recently purchased a 2020 Tundra from Jim Bagan Toyota in South Lake Tahoe, CA. I will 100% recommend this Toyota dealership to anyone I know.  I was able to do most of the buying process online which saved me so much time when I actually came in to purchase. Everything was spot on from the vehicle itself to the pricing information that was given to me online, no surprises at all.  Wayne and JJ were both very friendly and knowledgeable throughout the process.  I can't say enough good things about this dealership, thank you for the great experience!<//review>

<Text>We highly recommend this dealership. They went above and beyond than other dealerships we’ve dealt with.   It was an easy and a painless process to get our Toyota Highlander. Our sales representative  was Mark S. He was totally awesome.  He really worked with us and explained everything about the car to us. If we are in the market for another car we will definitely be going back to this dealership.<//Text>< Rating>

I went to Jim Bagan Toyota for my 20,000 mile service and a few days later to have factory roof racks installed. I was impressed with their super friendly staff, Kari handled my appointment flawlessly and with great conversation. Everyone was so nice and not in your face, or perhaps that was a new "Covid" standard. Either way great experience. Also only a few minutes into waiting I received a video message from "Jim Bagan Toyota" walking me through and explaining the diagnostics!! I thought that was pretty Cool!<//text>

Went in knowing this was likely the Toyota 4Runner I wanted. Wayne and Brad were responsive and helped me check out the vehicle straight away. Wayne was also really helpful in how all of the systems worked and getting the bluetooth setup. As I brought my mechanic brother with me, they also put the car up on the lift so we could check out the undercarriage as well. All went smoothly with purchasing - not a lot of wiggle room for negotiating as I wasn't ready to walk away from this one but Brad got me a lower APR than my bank through Toyota so appreciate that. Would definitely use them again. Thanks!<//text>

<text>After a day of failed attempts to leave Tahoe and head home, we had our SUV towed here late on a Sunday night.  Called first thing Monday morning to explain why my car was sitting there.  Despite having a full schedule, they were able to take a look at my car and diagnosis the issue.  They would've had us back on the road in 24hrs of drop off if they had all the parts needed.

The whole time, we worked with Tina in Servicing.  Tina provided excellent customer service and kept us updated on any changes.

Despite the struggle we had to get home, the staff at Jim Bagan helped make a stressful situation easier to get through.  Truly appreciate the work these folks do.

Thank You!< /text>< response>

Hands down the best car buying experience I've ever been a part of. I worked specifically with Brad Wade (Sales) and Jin Jung (Finance) and both delivered excellent customer service.  Once we completed the online information in advance of coming by the dealership, literally only took 15 minutes to complete everything and drive off in my new Tacoma.  Would definitely recommend the team at Jim Bagan Toyota if you're looking for a quality car-buying experience!</review>

<review>Very easy to work with, mellow and gave us the best pricing! By far our best car buying experience! We worked with Wayne and Jin and they were so professional but absolutely no pressure.

<review>Jim Bagan Toyota is more than five star! This was the ONLY dealer that I’ve been to that cares more about the customer than the commission! Mark, Brad, and Jin were quick to assist and get me into the truck of my dreams all within a day! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!< /review>< user>

They are kind and very helpful, and experienced. Mark with do everything he can to get you what you want and won’t sell the car out from under you.  JJ is happy to answer any of your questions and he will make the paperwork as smooth and quick as possible.  They do not pressure you and they do not try to sell you a bunch of things you don’t need.  They take their time with you and go over everything throughly.  I was very happy with my Toyota purchase from this dealership.  It is Worth the drive and you get to enjoy seeing Tahoe while you are there, maybe even go visit the beach with your new ride after your purchase, like we did :)
Thank you for the great experience.</Review>< pictures>

I have never had a bad experience because of the excellent staff and environment. Erica and JJ both go above and beyond to make sure you get what you need and that you’re making the best choice for you personally.

< review>
I’ve got nothing but accolades for Jim Bagan Toyota in South Lake Tahoe, CA.  We bought a new Rav4 from Jim Bagan in March of this year (2020). It could have been a complicated process with closures of businesses or difficulties at every step. Jim Bagan Toyota made the process easy and straightforward with practical, sensible and timely solutions to various challenges. I can’t imagine a more simple process - even under normal circumstances.

Recently, we returned the car for a concern about a slow leak on a tire. Jim Bagan Toyota brought the car into the shop, located the puncture and showed me the problem. Again, they offered solutions, including an option of patching the tire at no cost and describing the process with a brief visit with the actual technician that would be doing the repair. The repairs were perfect and completely resolved the issues as though it had never existed - with a perfectly balanced tire - like new! Other nearby dealerships had insisted on a $230.00 replacement tire with hours of downtime over multiple visits and no coherant explanation of the damage.

I’m in the safety business as an operator in commercial air transportation and I know quality service and maintenance when I see it. I give my highest recommendations to the friendly, helpful and impeccably competent team at Jim Bagan Toyota of South Lake Tahoe, CA.<//review>

Excellent service, I showed up dropped off my truck and I was pleasantly surprised when I received a video from the Technician who was working on my vehicle giving me a Birdseye view of what was being done to my vehicle. Jim Bagen Toyota is very efficient with their service department I would highly recommend this dealership.<//Text>

<Text>In the past, we've always had bad experiences walking into a dealership. We're from Reno, NV, and drove to Lake Tahoe to buy a car and had the best buying experience. We were looking to buy a new car from a local dealership, but because of all their hidden fees and the absurd doc fee, we were willing to drive 2 hours back and forth and were happy that we did. We couldn't believe how much they were willing to help us ahead of time over the phone before driving there, which saved us so much time. Dealing with everyone there was easy and never felt pressured.

Thank you JJ and Mark for your time. We love the car, and thank you so much for giving us an amazing deal! We have recommended your dealership to our friends and family, and we will definitely buy from you again!< /Text><username>Ian Dizon</username></record>

Best decision ever! Don’t be fooled by other dealerships claiming they have the best deal. Give them a shot and they will work with you. I want to thank Brad Wade for making this happen, he was very patient and accommodating to my needs. I saved a lot of money on fees alone and out state tax. Mark Shehadi was very helpful on the whole process as well, very knowledgeable and will walk you through everything you need to know about the vehicle. Jin Jung was awesome, he made sure that all our questions were answered and made sure we are satisfied. Overall, a really easy going professional people working here. I would highly recommend them. They earned my respect and business.< /text>

<review>How can the firing of a Service Manager impact the rest of the service team?? Was this the only person within the service department? It's been more than 2 weeks since we brought our Tacoma in for minor repairs and we have yet to get a completion date. If this is a one man show, you better find a replacement ASAP. Or, you could simply repeat what you did last time and promote the janitor......</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80998faf8c9cc42b:0xa620821af81bd07d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>We showed up at their used car lot in a loaner car because our car had just broken down and we were 300 miles from home. The salesman listened to our sad story and showed us all the cars we were considering. We needed all wheel drive and everything on the lot qualified. We chose the one we wanted and went over to their main lot to make the purchase. Everyone we dealt with were super helpful and we got an excellent deal on the car. We were in a very tight spot and could have been taken advantage of, but that didn't happen. If you are in South Lake Tahoe, this is the place to purchase a car.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Very unhappy with my Toyota care from these people only.  When you live in north Lake Tahoe it’s way easier to just drive to Reno. 1 out of 10 they get. At my 15k when I scheduled it I asked specifically to have my front passenger side hub looked at and they never did even though it was clicking, they are incompetent, under-staffed, and unrefined.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My husband and I needed a newer car and a friend recommended Jim Bagan Toyota. We like to shop local when we can, so we went there last week! Luckily, Salesman Robert Klemer was the first person we approached! He was very helpful and knowledgeable about the cars we looked at. We took a couple of test drives and picked out a great used RAV4 XLE!!  J.J. the Finance Specialist was helpful and explained all the details to us. Robert took his time showing us all the special features on our car!! I highly recommend Jim Bagan Toyota!!! We love our new car!!!👍👍👍👍👍<//review>

Took over three hours for an oil change!
Everyone kept saying just a little longer. They said they were waiting on a filter. I finally received my vehicle without a filter. No apologies. I will not be returning.< /Text>

This is the worst place ever. Not only do they not listen to what you want in a car they LIE over and over again. But don't waste your time complaining like me they don't listen or care. I'm still waiting to hear back from them on my complaint. They said they would get back to me in a couple of days it has been 2 weeks and still nothing. The star is for the service department they were the only ones that said it like it should be outstanding service by them.<//Review>

We love this place! Decided to buy our Prius local and it was a great decision. Their price on the AWD Prius was by far and away the best deal around. Every employee was extremely friendly and helpful. JJ (Jin Jung) especially went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Everytime we come back in I am more and more blown away by his customer service. They give great rewards for buying your car here. We already know that we will buy our next car here. I highly recommend that everyone goes to South Tahoe Jim Bagan Toyota.< /text>

Really bad service and worst costumers service

I make a appointment a week before to do oil change schedule appointment at 2:00 pm I showed up to drop off the vehicle take them 25 minutes to register one of the employees talked Me that I was gone take them 1.5 hrs to do the job it’s 4:00pm my truck still 2 cars in front of me at This point I asked to one of the employees how much longer and he talked me 30-45 minuets after it’s in the jacks. he also said it’s nothing you can do cus this it’s the only dealership in Tahoe so I have to live with it so at this point I list 2-3 hrs of work for an oil change they’re not be a next time for this dealership I just hope tha anyone that likes to spend half off day to do an oil change that’s the right place
good luck</Review>

Dave at CardinaleWay got the parts shipped in from as far as LA overnight, got my car repaired the next day, and I was on my way as scheduled.  The price was great compared to other dealers too.

< review>
Being a first time car buyer I didn’t really know what to expect when working with a dealership. I like to keep my business local so I visited Jim Bagan Toyota before heading off the hill to Carson City or Reno. Luckily, while I was on the lot I had the pleasure of meeting J.J. from the sales department. I explained that I was in need of new car with good gas mileage for my work commute and that would allow me enough space for my photography equipment. We walked through the new lineup of the 2019 RAV4 and J.J. was able to show me all of the new features and differences between models.

The employees at Jim Bagan Toyota allowed me to take all the time I needed to make my decision. They even let me put a “hold” on the car I was interested in during that time. There was no intimidation and no pressure to buy a car that didn’t exactly fit my needs. J.J. and the sales manager, Bradley helped me with all of the paperwork and made sure to explain everything thoroughly so there was no confusion. Before the transaction, they mentioned that during the detailing, a small scratch was discovered on the front bumper. They agreed to fix this for no additional fee. I look forward to bringing in my car to have this fixed this next week.

I’ve now had my new 2019 RAV4 for about a week and I love it. Driving over the summits for work everyday can be tough but this car has all the features and amenities I need. I would highly recommend Jim Bagan Toyota for anyone who is interested in buying or leasing a car. Thanks to J.J. and Bradley for the amazing customer service!<//review>

I felt my car might be running a little off.  Brought it in to these guys and they gave it the whole computer once over.  Car’s all good save for the o2 sensor-no biggie.  I sincerely appreciate an honest, straight up report.

<Text>Last week, I was quoted a specific price on a Tacoma over email by Mark Shehadi in sales. I called to confirm and was put in touch with Keyth, the sales manager, who confirmed that was the price. I put a deposit on the truck and drove 3 hours up to the dealership the next day to sign the papers.

When Scott Abel (Finance manager) and I sat down to do financing, I was informed that they couldn't sell the truck to me at the quoted price and said they could only sell it for MSRP.  We went back and forth for a bit and clearly weren't on the same page, so I got up and drove the 3 hours back home empty-handed.

I don't think I've ever felt so screwed over, for lack of a better phrase. I took off work, drove all the way up there, and had a friend take off work so he could drive my other pickup back home.

Maybe there was a lack of communication and it was an honest mistake or maybe they thought I wouldn't leave without a truck no matter the price after driving 3 hours, but it cost myself and my friend a whole day of our time, not to mention the lost hours at both of our jobs.

I did two stars instead of 1 because Scott ended up sending me a small check for my inconvenience.  It doesn't come close to covering my lost hours at work and doesn't give me my day back, but at least he tried to make it somewhat right.

I will say that Monica and Jesse in sales were a pleasure to talk to while I waited to do paperwork. Too bad we couldn't do business but I ended up purchasing a very similar truck (minor differences in options) at a dealer much closer to home for around the price I was initially quoted at CardinaleWay.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Very Dishonest, agreed to a price with Derek Simon.  The reps don't know what there doing, i was emailed one price, the next price was 750 dollars higher.  Mysteriously there trip permit fee went from 54.00 to 170.00.  Kept trying to push there crappy finance company on me, i told them i was already pre approved.    Horrible company, horrible experience I would not recommend them to anyone.  They have no follow up, no integrity.   If you check there other feedback also its horrible.  There yelp feedback was horrible as well as there dealerrater feedback.</Text>< Resp>

<review>I would like to give 5 stars to Dave Long, Cardinale Service Manager. From my first visit 2 years ago to just last week, whenever I call with an automotive concern, Dave is my man! If I choose to take on a large snow burm in my Prius and chew up the plastic protector-he can remove it. If  I was a dummy and didn't check my tire pressure when the tire light kept turining on/off no problem, no hassle-Dave just checked them out for safety and filled them back up. When my husband and I moved to Tahoe 2 years ago when I first met Dave he shared his local knowledge with us new comers. He is always friendly and gets the job done!</review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1550501353635, 'text': 'Hi Martha,\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to apologize for your experience at our dealership. We should have done a much better job of contacting you and keeping you updated on your vehicle’s status. That is our mistake and I am truly sorry. I will make sure management addresses this. The reason there has been such a delay is because we are trying to look up the extended service contract that covers your tires. We tried contacting Carson Toyota to find this information out, but they couldn’t give us an answer. Unfortunately, the bad weather has also caused a delay in shipping the parts, so I do apologize for the inconvenience and frustration.\n\nFrom my understanding, Brad has been in contact with you and is working to make this right. Please let me know if there is anything else you need. Again, I apologize for this situation and truly hope we have the opportunity to earn back your business in the future.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nChelsea B.\nJim Bagan Toyota\nCustomer Experience Manager'}</response>

<rate>5</rate><review>Jose and his crew are amazing over here. I got my car ceramic coated by them about 2 years ago and take it in for it's annual inspection. Recently my car got scratched up in the hood area and his shop give the best quote on fixing the scratches and reapplying a coating without actually having to do the whole car like other shops told me. So my girlfriend took her car there (since I told her to) today for a basic wash because it was dirty and she was very happy with the results. Since my car is ceramic coated with System-X, I get the ceramic wash by them if I have water spots or tough stains that I can't get off by myself since I wash my own car.<//review>< Pics>

Awesome place ! , I went to them on March 18th for an engine bay detail and it came out beautifully! , they also saw my headlights needed some love so they cleared up my headlights and it came with a car wash . Everything was looking nice and clean and tooken care of when it was time for me to look at my car .  The headlights still look awesome and clean since they detailed it ! I would post photos but it's not giving me the option to , but overall I paid $230 for the engine bay detail ( $150 ) , headlights restoration ($80) and a car wash included.  I'm very happy with what they did and the timing they completed it . I would recommend this place! They are pretty cool people for sure ! I'll have to go back for a paint correction 😁<//review>

I love how they got every single detail of disgust me and my kids made in my suv and I drove across the country with this car so the outside had so much dirt engraved on it from all that traveling. When u go to a car detailing and they get done In less than an hour , they can’t POSSIBLY be putting a lot of effort into detailing like king auto does!!! I respected how long it took because I knew they were REALLY gonna deep clean.. I returned back to my vehicle AMAZED! My car looks BRAND NEW.. my 5 year old daughter said “mommy is this a new car” lol ... I told her it just looks like new but it’s the same car!! Omg I totally recommended this company and great job to the workers! Y’all are amazing and if I ever have a horrific scene in my suv again I will ONLY be coming to this place!!!</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Motorcycle guys, this review is for you!  I took my motorycle to get detailed by these guys and it looked BETTER than it did off the show room for!  Everything was cleaned and polished, not an inch missed!  The colors looked in a way which I had never seen before.  The colors popped so much more creating a great contrast between each other.  This was my first time ever having anything professionally detailed, I will most definitely be back with my bike.  I was so impressed that I will also be bringing my car as well!< /Review>

I called and they had a spot available. I managed to get my car's interior cleaned last minute and super fast. Good Quality and super friendly. Would recommend.</review>

King Auto Detailing was great to work with, did lots of extra things to make the car even better and worked with my insurance company! He's the only collision center I'd ever work with in LA. Incredibly accommodating! Thank you!</Review>

Awesome experience here and they do great work. I brought in my BMW i8 to get the rims detailed after accumulating quite a bit of break dust and they made them look brand new. Can really tell they are passionate about their work. In addition they found two screws in my tires and partnered with the tire shop next door to repair it basically for free. Felt really taken care of and the final results were better than I expected. 10/10 recommend. All around great service and they look out for their customers.<//Text>

I was shocked at the end result - they looked brand new! Bi was so happy with the results that I had them wash it, too.  It was a mess on the inside but their vacuuming got rid of all the debris, dog hair, etc. I looking forward to having them detail it!< /review>< pics>

King Auto Detailing made the 14 year old engine look brand new! They did an absolutely beautiful job.

Great service and best detailed cleaning. Took my car for a regular car wash and they went above and beyond and left my car spotless. They took their time, did a deep cleaning of the interior and left it brand new again. Due to everything being closed and when I contacted them, they were able to book me right away. I would definitely recommend this place they will take care of your car.

Will be coming back!<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>The best detailed cleaning we ever had. And also the nicest and most professional employees. Our toddler had thrown up on her ENTIRE car seat and the back of our car. So as we’re desperately trying to find a place that would clean it, we came across their information on Google. We called them and they were very nice, gave us a price range and ended up charging us on the lower range of price they gave us. Not to mention that afterwards the car was SOOOOO SO clean like if nothing ever even happened. I’m sure it wasn’t easy either because it was already dry prior to cleaning. We sure would’ve never been able to clean it that good on our own. They also vacuumed the whole car which was more than the service we paid for and they took the time to explain to us how to dry the car seat once we were back home! HIGHLY recommend this place. You won’t regret it!<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiz8r521dhGXCX3BCk3x53RcwBC3-yUo6WKlc-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

They were disrespectful the moment I came in and tried to over charge me for being a woman. They also were making me very uncomfortable from the moment I pulled up, interrupting me and speaking to me like a child. They also were noticeably high and not a single one of them had masks or gloves on while interacting with customers during this pandemic and being inside of as well as touching everything inside of people’s vehicles<//text>

King Auto Detailing is simply the best. Took my car in for a full detail and ceramic coating and I am blown away by the quality of their work. It is top notch. They will treat your car as if it is their own. Best group of guys in the valley hands down. They earned a lifelong customer in me. If you want next level work, family atmosphere, and reasonable pricing you’ll find all 3 at King Auto Detailing. Ask for Jose and Armando.</review>

<Review>The king auto detailing team is one of the best out there in LA, always taking care of my daily car and all the work they get done to your car for the right price is just something you don’t find anywhere in LA. Bringing your car over to them is without a question a must !< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

My car was way overdue for a deep cleaning. I usually keep my car clean but after going camping and and letting it go a bit lately I though I was never going to get it like new again. But these guys accomplished the impossible! Every crevasse and hard to reach place was clean. In spots of the car I didn’t think they’d be able to get to without removing the seats. Top notch job for a decent price too. My car looks and smells brand new!

Interior Detailing. Comes with a complimentary wash.< /text>

King Auto Detail is an excellent car detail/wash place located in the valley. It is run by a dedicated and hardworking team who do a stellar job making every vehicle shine. I drive a very long way to bring my car here for detailing and the results have always been remarkable. Highly recommended!<//Review>

<review>Came for a car wash and to get some sap removed from my car. Results were great. Great attention to details. Guys were personable, honest, and did not try to upsell. Will definitely come back. Keep in mind that there is no waiting room, so make an appointment to minimize wait time.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1536864697946, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave a review, we appreciate the kind words!'}<//response><gmapID>0x80c29c64be9c2183:0xfbf9897f0ca5f80e<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is down the street from my place and every time I pass by here it’s packed with cars. And for a good reason. They do detailing to another lever and even if you just want a regular car wash they always go out of their way to perfect it and leave your car looking brand new. Always a pleasure and never a disappointment 👌🏼<//review>

<Date>1490129902452<//Date><Text>This was a great place to take my car to be detailed and cleaned! I texted Jose, he was very responsive and informative. He worked with me on a package and price that were incredibly reasonable and worked with my schedule. I can't believe how new my car looks!!! They got stains out of the fabric interior and built up grime out of the cup holders and crevices. I even ended up with a few splatter marks on the ceiling which he got out!!!
Leave a good amount of time for them to complete the work, because they are very detailed, and time for the interior to dry after the appointment. Really impressed by the quality of work for the reasonable prices!! They even offer discounts on first time customers!!</Text><Response>None<//Response>< Rate>

Excellent Work! I stopped by after checking raving reviews from various sites. I lucked out that the morning was free to take care of my car since I stopped by early. (It is usually appointment based as detailing does take time to do right.) Jose greeted me, and was very patient when I went over my situation.

Desperately needed my engine cleaned as I hadn't cleaned it in years, really embarrassed by how grimy it was. I also needed my headlight covers cleaned, they were frosted over completely and barely put out any light. I tried a hack solution that only worked for a little, and the dealership wanted to replace the entire headlight assembly unit for an insane amount. I had the interior cleaned a little as well.

Upon pick up, it was amazing! The engine was pristine and the headlight covers were sparkling. The next customer getting service was so impressed with the work, he wanted his light covers cleaned, too. (That night, I actually could see more than a couple feet in front of me with the regular beams on.) The interior was spick and span.

The customer service was immpecable. It is a family owned business. They are all nice and take much pride in their work. The price was extremely fair considering it was not easy for what needed to be done. Would definitely recommend. Thank you!<//Text>

My co-worker Jasmin told me about this place. She made me an appointment, I showed up with my car, and our homie Jose took care of the rest. After about 30 minutes, my car looked and smelled brand new. Best car detailing service EVER! We won't go anywhere else from now on.<//review>

<rate>5</rate><text>Best Long Beach to Disney shuttle service around! My family of 5 was shuttled for $55, by far the best price I could find. They provided free boosters and car seat. Mickey called several times before both pick up times to confirm everything, so I was never worried about them not being there. We rode in a newer Ford E-150 passenger van that was very clean. Room for 9 passengers. We got the van all to ourselves both times too. I'll admit his website is very  bizarre but don't let that fool you. Mickey runs a first class shuttle service that I will use every time I go to Disneyland from now on!<//text><GmapID>0x80dcd7d559d1bf97:0xcafce5c10290e226< /GmapID>< pics>

<text>We had just arrived for our honeymoon for Disneyland. We couldn't find the shuttle that was supposed to take us to our hotel. Luckily, we found this with a man named Kelly. He was very nice and understanding. Even when we needed to go back to the airport under a strict time limit, he managed to help us make it. Will gladly use again when in the area.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Finally a ride to the airport and I can depend on. Our driver / Kelly was courteous and on time. On our return flight we called him when we  landed, and  again when we got our bags. Remarkably he was waiting for us at the curb! / Kelly also knew all the shortcuts which cut our driving time.  Best driver yet! We will use him again in the future for sure.<//review>< pictures>

I called before I left and they said I would pay $30 a person but if I did them for the return it would be $15 a person. So on the way back to the airport the driver said $30 a person. I said what I was quoted and he said "I wouldn't get out of bed for that price! Gas is $4 a gallon" ended up having to pay double what I was quoted for return and the owner hasn't picked up the phone for me to even try to address the problem. Plus it is cash only so that money is gone.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

Great service. Good for large and small groups.  This is the second time I've used this company. The first time was with my family of 7 and this time was with a friend. Amazing both times. Only accepts cash and there are instructions that you need to follow like calling to make sure you are ready for pick-up but for the price it's worth it.</text>

We originally went with a different shuttle to take us to Disney land hotel from LAX. When we wore stood up by the company we wore offered a ride from a driver with mickeys spaceship shuttle. We got there quick and the driver was super nice.  To top it off my husband left his beat wireless head phones in the shuttle. The owner tracked them down and mailed them back to us. Thank you again.<//Review>

I get onboard and driver starts driving around airport stating he refuses to leave with just 1. WELL WHY PUT ME BAGS ONBOARD. 50mins later and still haven’t left and he tries holding onto my bags.

Both my experiences being picked up from the airport have been amazing and safe to our airport. Sadly on our way back to the hotel there was a miscommunication with another family that they thought was us who cancelled.  I called the night before to confirm and 10 minutes after our pick up time I called to see where our shuttle was. They said we cancelled I said "um,no" they did not have any Van's to come get us so we had to get an uber at the last minute and rush through LAX TSA with 2 kids. They offered to give me money for the uber at the airport but I couldn't pass through the no reentry gate. I then was promised to be mailed a check to reimburse the uber and a month later I still have not received it. Friendly company just wish we would have been reimbursed as promised.< /review><Rating>3</Rating><GmapID>0x80dcd7d559d1bf97:0xcafce5c10290e226</GmapID>< Date>

I was over charged by $10 I double checked with driver then called the company and checked the price. I complained and wanted to be credited the 10 back on my return trip.

When I called back to arrange my return.

I was told I must have tipped him that much by mistake
He doesn’t speak English and misunderstood
He does understand English and says you said keep the change
He has kids and is just trying to make a living
We’ll take you back but the guy who cheated you then lied Will be your 45 minute ride back
Some one else will take you but it’ll be full price you would have paid anyway for the ride which is ok cause you’ll be alone in the car which is normally more money because it’s a private ride,  but you’ll be with someone who’s acting mad and telling you it’s your fault and you’re mad and not to be mean Because I said I was leaving a bad review that I was cheated and then told you’ll still be out the money he overcharged you. Oh and it would be easier if it was 1/2 later and across the street so I don’t have to turn around.
Once they figured out I wasn’t backing down they offered me a free ride but I no longer felt safe with them.

Never again and I’ll stick with SuperShuttle who picked me up last minute.

Michael and Ceasre can split the money they stole.< /Text>

I will send you the money call me give me your address please. Most people would tip that much. ???'}< /response>< pictures>

Mickeys space shuttle service was great! My husband, 8 month old daughter, and I were picked up from the Anaheim Maingate hotel and dropped off safely at the Disneyland Resort. Mickey was patient and courteous while we folded our stroller and got all of our belongings in order to get on and off of the shuttle and even provided a car seat for our daughter. I will say the car seats are not top of the line however, they get the job done for a quick ride. Overall I absolutely recommend this shuttle service and am glad to have stumbled across it, we will definitely use this again.< /Text>

Mickey was a great driver! He took us to the park and picked us up after the fireworks. He was very helpful and friendly. I especially appreciated his thoughtfulness in checking the time of the fireworks that night so he was there to pick us up right after they ended. Would use this service again!< /Text>

<review>Kelly was awesome picked us up in a bind at lax took us to our hotel was reasonably priced and offers a service that is family oriented that you cant get with super shuttle or uber. Had plenty of seats space for luggage and car seats and boosters. Highly recommend him and also took us back to lax straight from the hotel when we needed him to and no other stops along the way.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd7d559d1bf97:0xcafce5c10290e226< /Gmap_id>< rate>

<Review>I bring large groups of Japanese tourists to LAX and Disneyland several each year.  With my very large groups that insist on having toilets on a big bus, the more expensive, time limited, slower Disneyland Express wins out; but in my groups of a dozen or less (with no bathroom needs) Mickey’s totally dominates all other services.  They are more time flexible, picking you up and delivering you late or early.   No waiting at LAX for 7 hours because you had to catch the last bus.  Personally met Mickey as well.  He found a huge need in transportation service and filled it.  So, you want the best price, friendly service, time flexibility, call up Mickey and his crew.  Note...I have seen a shady looking van with Mickey’s name spray painted in the side.   If it looks tacky, it is not Mickey.<//Review></record>

<Text>Our driver was Kelly. Once we arrived at LAX and waited in the green area for a shuttle service, we heard Kelly offering transportation to Disneyland. He was prepared with car seats and booster seats (our son needed a booster), and had space for my family of three. He got us to our destination in the time he said...and we were taken right to the door! He gave us his card if qe needes a ride back once our trip was over. Again, he arrived promptly at the time he said he would be at our hotel, and had us at LAX in no time.
My son even left his hat in the car, and Jelly met me at the terminal so I could retrieve it. He saved us a lot of tears that day!
I highly recommend this service, and ask for Kelly when you go (although, I am sure the other drivers must be up to those standards as well).< /Text>< resp>

We used Mickey’s Spaceship Shuttle round trip to Universal Studios and to the airport on our way home.  Our drivers were early or on time, friendly, safe drivers.  Great prices for family of 5.  Thank you very much!<//text>

Their website scared the crap out of me.  Talking to Mickey on the phone was less intimidating but still - I was anxious.  We traveled to Disneyland at Christmas - our first ever trip - so we were anxious NOT to be duped or left stranded.  We used Mickey's service four times:  to/From Disneyland and then to/from LA to Long Beach for a cruise within a week span.  We loved our driver's Joseph and Robert.  On time.  Helpful and very kind.  Got us from pint A to B well.  We had one hiccup as last day we had two vans (15 people) and one van arrived 35 minutes behind the other.  Thankfully we weren't headed to the airport and we had some wiggle room.  Mickey was on it and was in contact with all parties and resolved the issues as quickly as possible.  Cash only seemed nutty to me but paid upon drop off without issue.  It is just VERY strange to NOT have a way to hold or guarantee arrangements in 2016.  All worked out and we would call Mickey again if needed.</review>

Great customer service.  We were waiting for a bus to come from our hotel shuttle which was taking longer than normal.  Seemed to be lunch time.  Mickey's Space ship shuttle picked us up and took us to the park in no time.  Thank you again!</Review>

This company is the worst run shuttle company in Southern California. DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY! They left myself, wife and 2 children sitting outside at the LA airport at midnight. I confirmed with the driver 3 times before going on our vacation and he promised he would be there to pick us up. After waiting 2 hours and calling him 8 eight times, he never answered the phone and never did return my calls. The name fits them. A bunch of "Space Cadets". This is a completely unprofessional company and should not be in operation. If you want a reliable shuttle, choose Super Shuttle.</Review>

You gave us a time but not the am or pm. You were sitting out side at midnight you state above, does that mean we are suppose to wait for your to midnight when the airport is shut down and you forgot to put pm on your time. You are a bad travel planner blaming it on us. Uber was there, serge pricing would be $200 at that time of night. Are we suppose to get out of bed driver 40 miles from anaheim to get you and back at midnight. I don't think so.best regards try us in the day time we are easy breezy and best price with less hassel. :-)"}< /response>

So, my mom booked a big Disneyland Express bus through AAA just as she had on trip 4 yrs ago. But, the bus didn't come (we saw it broken down on the side of the highway when we were leaving LAX. Mickey of Mickey's Space Ship Shuttle at first seemed sketchy with how he was trying to convince us to let him take us to our hotel. Ultimately, it was a good move because w/in an hour we arrived to our hotel near Katella & S Harbor Blvd by Disneyland. He could pack all 9 of us in, and our luggage, including 1 yr old. The van was really dated but had seat belts, a smooth ride, and we learned about local points along the way. The best part was that we were able to arrange for our return to LAX at the end of the week so we had a ride we could count on. The return bus w/Kelly was much newer. Same smooth ride, courteous driver & baby seat.  The big Disneyland Express bus we took 4 yrs ago was nicer looking & prettier. BUT, we will use & recommend the Mickey Space Ship Shuttle from now one. The Disneyland Express bus is harder to catch (run hourly &  hard to find @ LAX), no baby seats, can't navigate traffic as quickly, not local, poor communication. All things MSSS does better, even if the 1 van was old & well-used. For our group of 9, it was perfect. Despite my original hesitation, I fully recommend to any family. I was interested in the poor reviews and see how drivers tried to fill their busses to make it worth their while to drive. I recommend: determine prices, locations & payment types when trips are arranged. I think then things will all be fine.< /Text>

<Review>Ridiculous Price. Labeling as Disneyland Express is BS and I’m sure just a way to get peoples money. No other companies charge for under 2 years, this one does. The “free baby seats” also don’t matter when you have a two year old and you’re offered a booster. Extra cost for using a card, we were told $30 for adults and $15 for kids which isn’t accurate according to the website. For $115 for 5 of us, I may as well have rented a car just to sit at the resort until we needed a ride back to the airport.</Review><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

<text>What a rip off! The website says $22/person one way and somehow for two people I was charged close to $75!!!!!! This company is disgusting and not professional at all! I don't recommend. We drove around the airport loop over 10 times and then he told us that he needed to pick up more people for a cheaper fare. I though wow, cheaper than 22/per person, cool. LIE! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. IT'S A RIP OFF, YOU'RE BETTER OFF TAKING AN UBER. LESSON LEARNED, NEVER AGAIN.< /text>< user>

Scheduled service has extra rounds of the Central Terminal Area. If at any time you wish to take another company while still in the airport. It is easy to ask and take another company. Uber cost more than us most the time and if you get in a wreck you will have a hard time being helped with your damages. We have commercial insurance of 1.5 million dollars on each vehicle. $22 is for pre scheduled family discounts of 3 or more. A family of 6 or more is $15 each to disneyland family discount.

What a horrible way to start our Disney vacation! Our shuttle driver was reckless and was very close to getting us into a wreck; the shuttle ended up in the emergency shoulder lane on the highway. He even had the audacity to joke that he's a bad driver. We were lied to and told this was the Disney Express, which we told the driver that that was the shuttle we were waiting for and wanting to take. This service is dangerous, misleading and flat out cons tourists!< /review>

We are cheaper for adult we are $45 round trip they are $48.This is a lie. We have all the same rights as they do and we are more sufficient to go with cheaper, faster, less time spent at LAX curb, and our drivers can help you with info that is needed in the area. The big bus is more dangerous see the bus burnt to the ground on our internet sight MICKEYSAIRPORTBUS.com  They have been in chapter 11 bankrupcy for 3 or 4 years.\nwe are way better for your family than they are because we are safer, less time, less money and to your door of the hotel not the street.

First of all Mickey Shuttle service is THE ONE from Disneyland I highly RECOMMEND.  My son  and I were left STRANDED by the Disneyland Shuttle that changed bus type w/o signage on it unlike  the one we arrived there on. GOD told me to call Mickeys Spaceship Shuttle Service and low and behold he was only 15 mins from Disneyland and he came to pick up my son and I up right away and drove us not just back to the airport BUT to our Hotel.  I called the Disneyland land Shuttle people and they didn't care even though I purchased a roundtrip ticket for my 8 year old son and I LEFT US STRANDED. That almost ruined our first visit to California. They need to know a lot of people aren't familiar with there random coach changes.

One of your driver got really angry and rolled down his window and cussed me out after I merged in front of him in traffic near LAX.  If your driver can't handle the driving pattern around LAX perhaps this is not the right job for him.< /text>

< review>
My recent experience here was a disaster.  Spent an hour to buy a new phone for my daughter, went through the whole process of choosing a number, agreeing to terms, paying up front for the phone, etc and left thinking all was good to go.  Phone doesn't work, SIM not paired with the  phone number, the phone number they gave me doesn't exist on my plan.  Spent another 75 minutes on the phone with Verizon tech support this AM trying to sort out.  They couldn't do so either......in 75 minutes of MY TIME.  Now headed back to store to spend more time dealing.  BLOWN AWAY BY THEIR GENERAL INEPTITUDE.< /review>

Question: How many Verizon agents, chats, texts, codes, and wasted words are necessary before you get your new phone activated?

This is a great store. I was actually forced to stop here last Thursday June 1st due to bad traffic going home on 101. It was the best Verizon I have been in in a long time. Service was fast and Juan was able to replace my bad SIM card in a jiffy. He was very attentive and knowledgeable. I will definitely return to this location in the future.< /Text>

<Name>Intensify LLC</Name><Review>Customer service is horrible, must not be an  essential part of this locations business. Would be nice if this location actually tried to find better ways to assist their customers. Staff didn't even care that their long time (LOYAL) customer had a bad experience. Too bad this staff isn't continually improving themselves. From now on, we will do ALL of our Verizon business either over the internet or phone for a better experience. Staff are so short sighted.</Review>< pics>

After saying they would replace it, they then told me I had to purchase a new band. Or I could call Verizon for my damage coverage which I pay $10 a month for. In the end if I wanted to replace the band that broke within 7 days I had to pay $19. The band had to cost 30 cents. They were not very helpful in the store or apologetic.

<Review>This place has very very bad customer service. Their social skills are poor. They are either not educated or had been trained to mislead customers purposly to their benefit and take advantage of people who simply trust them. Their attitude are so unpleasant by rolling eyes when we asked to repeat the plan when was unclear. The second visit when we claimed about the miss leading and giving the plan with unwanted changes that, the agent kept repeating an untrue statement without listening and concerning about a realistic statement of customer. Suddenly he made up story and said you are over talking me and yelling at me, I don’t have time for you, he walked away to the back room without letting us how we can resolve the problem. We asked another agent to see if the manager is available. The manager showed up very unpolitely said they didn't set this unwanted plan for us, they can't do anything about it. My husband reached San Francisco Verizon and they resolved it with apology.</Review><gmap_id>0x80859a8c7a94f5c5:0x5cd06fd217ac5252</gmap_id><response>{'time': 1550073510208, 'text': "Hello Tamila, we want to make sure our customers feel welcome and supported at our store.

Very poor experience. Sales rep & Manager did not take responsibility for honoring commitment Verizon service & THEIR store made previous day.

Long story short. I called their location, they told me to call Verizon national number instead. Verizon national number talked to them, then told me to come into store the next day. The next day Andrew, and then Carlos, the manager, did not acknowledge that phone call and shrugged off all responsibility. I wasted 15-20 minutes waiting to talk to someone, watching them serve sales calls ahead of my exchange, then 15-20 minutes with them. I almost never write these types of reviews, but I will never go to that location again. I left more frustrated then I have been in a while (since last Comcast call).

Verizon national number afterwards was far more accommodating.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I was in the Corte Madera store  recently and had a very bad experience.  The young man who as "assisted" me was very rude.  He has a very unusual name which I do not remember.  He was impatient and condescending.  Because of what he said to me as I left the store I can only believe that he was acting out of racism. I worked in retail for many years and will say this was the worst customer service I have experienced in my entire life. Shame on you!!< /Review>< resp>

Worst service ever.  “Justin” acted like it was an inconvenience to have me in the store having an issue with my Verizon service.   Very dismissive, discourteous and rude.  And of course, he still didn’t fix my phone!   On my way to AT&T.    Way to lose a family of long time customers, Verizon!< /Review>

< review>
Syrian guy who opens the store is very nice, but the guys who run the later shifts are rather cold and standoffish.   The store itself is quite clean, well organized and has great selection of convenience store items, with many hispanic products.  The ice cream freezer near the front door has a lot of excellent treats.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Best Sandwiches I have ever had. The bread is lightly crispy and on the outside and soft and tasty with every bite. Perfect amount of meat and condiments. A big crunchy bite FULL of taste each time. I am originally from San Francisco and have moved to Sacramento in the early 2000's. I will drive there when I get craving for a perfect sanwich. I have loved their sandwiches for like 30 years or close to it.</review>< pictures>

Roxie Food Center is incredible. Junior size is just right but if you have bigger appetite then order for bigger, still excellent quality! Highly recommended!<//text>

Roxie sandwiches are well made to how you want it.

Soooooo delicious!!!!!!!

Buy two, one for your girlfriend/boyfriend and switch halves.

Tony runs a happy crew and clean environment.

Who says that you can't eat a sandwich for dinner? Stop by Roxie's after work and get your jumbo sandwich, chips and drink....then settle back to watch your favorite movie, sports or tv program.

Relax and enjoy your Roxie sandwich.<//Review>

Had been here 40 yrs ago. Going to memory lane. After swimming recreation time with all my friends on the wkends. We as friends would put all our money together & buy a long sandwich & have them cut it for 5 of us. Also purple licorice was our favorite. Great times!! I did buy potato salad. Which was delicious also. Then waited for my Mortadella w/everything on it except jalapenos..it was b4 12noon. I looked back.There was a long line. Owner came out & handed me my bag.
Very polite & humble.. went back to sit at the park.
Couldn't wait to start on half of my sandwich.. so delicious added with a sunny breeze of nice weather.. Happy 2021 you all<//Text>

Their sandwiches are huge, even a junior sized one. I usually order their veggie cause it one of the most complex veggie sandwiches in the city. They include pickled artichokes, tri colore salad, avocado, lettuce, red onion, pickles and jalapenos. It is hearty for a veggie sandwich.
If you're afraid of green food the tritip and the pastrami are tasty. They have several yummy sandwich combos to choose from.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

The bread is just crunch and light, not like any sandwich I’ve tasted. The filling is good too, simple and fresh. Two of us shared one big long sandwich.

Will come back here if we ever come near this part of SF, to try all the other flavour.< /text>

Been going here since 1995. Makes me kinda like a newbie. Met  Simon and Pete when I lived in mission terrace. Kind of guys who know everyone's name. Make you feel like a regular in no time... Like "cheers" lol. Bottom line... Best Sandy's in town. They do good biz, but you never have to wait more that 5 minutes. I usually call ahead and then just grab and go. Try supreme roast beef, toasted.
OK not the best pic.. What can you do?<//Text>

I've been meaning to get a sandwich here for all of my adult life, today I finally did.  It was a solid, old school, deli style sandwich, done well.  For the price, definitely worth it.  Great customer service, too.<//Review>

Absolute best sandwhiches in California hands down. They are known for their Dutch crunch. The Turkey club is one of my favorites. This is a must try and is definitely worth an hour drive if needed. Owner and his wife are both amazing people.< /review>

BEST SANDWICHES IN THE CITY THEY SMOKE THEIR OWN TRI TIP. The owners are wonderful neighbors, will usually let you try the tri tip and it will convince you. The Roxie is also a good Italian style sub with mortadella. My husband loves the crab salad as a side. The chip and candy selection is pretty slick lots of rare finds like voodoo chips and international candy.< /Text>

Small grocery store, but they shine with their deli. Lots of options, including vegetarian. You can call in and they will have your sandwich waiting when you get there, although we usually just show up and order--it doesn't take that long.

Great family vibe from the folks working there. They are always friendly with anyone walking in.< /Text>

Very nice, gave us cash for the bus even without us having to buy something.

Then he drew us in by giving sandwich samples. It convinced us to buy one it was so good.< /text>

I heard about this place from my storage place. I figured why not, it's on my way home and I haven't had a really good classic sandwich in a long time. Upon arrival I knew this was going to be an awesome place just on the smell alone. A complete hole in the wall spot where everyone knows everyone. The options were simple and straightforward, I got the roxie special. I decided it was too nice of a day to eat this hunched over my laptop trying to work. So i walked across the street to Balboa Park and ate this beauty. I cant remember the last time I had a sandwich this good!< /review>

<text>I tumbled upon it and I was pleasantly surprised. They offer Roast Beef as a meat choice and it is pretty darn good. The sandwich is fairly thick, the ingredients taste fresh and they balance it well compared to the meat, the bread they use is good (I order Dutch crunch anytime I can) and the sandwich is properly toasted. They go for "Junior" for the smallest size, note that the "Regular" size is quite filling. It does get soggy pretty quickly due to the mayo/mustard so either you need to eat it right away or ask them to be light on those two.<//text>< pictures>

Love this place so much, we ate here twice during our 4 day visit. Houston has a lot of great food, but we don't have sandwiches like this. And Simon is so nice. I'm gonna crave this place when we get back. Pro tip: If this is your first time, order with the people cooking,  then tell Simon what you ordered when you pay.<//review>

Amazing family owned corner shop and deli, they offer lots of snack options and their sandwiches are delicious! They have 3 sizes, and the supreme is so big, it's like having two meals in one! Yummy fresh ingredients and friendly staff< /Text>

Small grocer with food options including salad, spagetti and pasta, alcohol etc.
Tried the Simon's special sandwich, slightly pricey but good. Recommend to add on avocado as well! Please note that there's no sitting area provided.< /text>

The most amazing sandwich place in SF. I recommend the Simon special. This sandwich heals a hangover. The staff here are also some of the friendliest in town. I have received discounts or even a free item at multiple visits to this store.<//text>

Easily my top 5 sandwich place in San Francisco. Toasted salami sandwich is a hit every time. The regular size is enough for two to share, but with their options you'll find your partner wanting her/his own.< /text>

Simply put, they make the best sandwiches with the freshest ingredients!  The bread is ALWAYS FRESH, and makes the sandwich.  Try the Tony Special which is delicious!< /Text>

<text>Hand down, BEST Sandwiches in San Francisco! I'm so lucky to live in the Excelsior and have Roxie's just a hop, skip and jump away! My go to is a Regular Mortadella on Sourdough, everything on it, toasted. Some people think the bread to meat ratio is 60:40 but I think it's perfect. The guys that run the place are hilarious and never fail to make everyone feel welcome.

Although getting in line can be a bit confusing for people when they first come here, it's totally worth it. (For those who haven't tried Roxie's yet: When you come in the front door, walk along the drinks and sodas, and the line starts at the first deli case)

Keep up the great work, Roxie's</text>< Gmap_id>

We chatted with the owners for a bit, and they were friendly enough to give us a corkscrew when they found they didn't have any screw top wine bottles, as we had forgotten ours at home.

And the sandwiches were fantastic as well.< /review>< userid>

<Review>A local favorite. Appearing simply as a corner store, the sandwiches made behind the counter have the quality equal to nothing less than an established Deli. The toasted Roxie special on dutch crunch bread is a hefty lunch and a safe choice for newcomers.< /Review>< Pictures>

If you come in, you get great coffee, good food, and kind words. If you come back, you're a friend of Simon's, and he asks about how the wedding was, and reminded that, since you're a regular, you should bring back the carton to carry your coffee cups.< /review>

Hole in the whole sandwich spot. There's no place for you to sit but there is a nice park across the street.

The sandwiches are bomb. There's plenty of chips and beverages to choose from.</Review>

I've been eating sandwiches here off and on for at least 20 years.  The quality and portions never change. If you are a rookie, try the pastrami.<//review>
