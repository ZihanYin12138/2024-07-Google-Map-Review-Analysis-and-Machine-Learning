<Review>This was my first experience with Santa Clarita Auto Sound.  I drove 30 mile (San Fernando Valley) to have work done on my Volvo SUV.  I had S/C Auto Sound do chrome delete on my entire car (front grill, window trim both sides, the roof rack, both driver/passenger side mirrors, and rear hatch cargo step) and install an amp and a sub to my stock sound system.  Very happy with the results.  The work looks like its factory OEM.  Price was reasonable and fair.  Professional business, no shady employees (unlike some of the Auto Sound stores I've dealt with in the S/F valley who barely speak English and lie to you all day long), good overall experience.  I highly recommend this place.<//Review>< Date>

< Review>
I recently brought my boat to Santa Clarita Auto Sound, I have for years wanted to update and improve the sound system in it I just never knew how, and thought the amount of custom work would just be way to expensive for me to afford.  I contacted Santa Clarita Auto Sound, who was referred to me by my boat mechanic.  When I dropped the boat off,  I discussed my needs and was assured that they could take care of everything I wanted.  Let me Tell you that the end result was better than I imagined, and the craftsmanship of the custom parts was exquisite.  They answered all of my concerns and checked to make sure that I approved of any custom installation that was not originally discussed, they even were able to accommodate a quick connect amplifier system. As many boat owners know when we store our boats theft of such Audio systems is a big problem.  I would definitely recommend Santa Clarita Auto Sound to anyone.  I think that you will be more than pleased with their work.<//Review>

<Review>Thought this place seemed legit until I became a customer. I paid well over 300$ to replace (2) door speakers that should have been 5 x 7. Omg!! I ended up having to replace them within 2 months!!! Found out the only 5x7 they put in my vehicle was the mount to fit a 5 & quarter speaker!!! I don’t have the time to go back but really I wouldn’t want to. I took my 300$ loss but DONT DO THE SAME!! Go SOMEWHERE ELSE! Oh yea, when I called the place, they said my receipt didn’t say what size speaker! Ya, I bet it didn’t< /Review><user>115807385295778625260< /user>< response>
{'time': 1624390895912, 'text': "Hi Jennifer, we apologize for any inconvenience. I believe we scheduled a few appointments right after the installation to go over your concerns but you never showed. I believe we also spoke with your husband and assited him with all your concerns more than six months after the purchase date. He had mentioned that you had a sound system installed from another shop and didn't like the sound coming out of the previous front speakers. Unfortunately we weren't aware that's the reason you wanted to change the speakers. In this case it wouldn't be the speakers but more likely the sound system installed from another shop that's giving the bad sound. We usually custom fit the best sounding speakers. The speaker sizes would be on the receipt. Unfortunately If you're not able to show up for any appointments it's difficult for us to help with any concerns you have. Please reach out to us at (661) 286-1100 if you like to discuss anything further."}</response>

Great customer service ! I drove 50 miles to Santa Clarita because nobody was willing to work on my Lexus around where I live. It was well
Worth the drive. Henry and David were very knowledgeable and helpful through the whole installation process. I’m so happy how my Lexus looks with the new DMH-WT7600NEX. Also my backup camera looks great. Thank you to all Santa Clarita auto crew.< /text>

We just had new speakers and amps installed at Santa Clarita Auto Sound. Everyone loved the music it was so much more clear and crisp. One particular day we went to the sandbar and three different boats had their stereos on  and they were blasting it. We fired up our stereo and turned it up and everybody shut the stereos off they just got blown out!< /review>

Excellent service and customer relations.  I have an old car and they were able to put a new alarm system in at a reasonable cost and remove the old one.  From the first phone call through installation everyone at Santa Clarita Auto Sound was stellar.  I will be visiting them again soon to have a keyless entry installed in my grand daughters car.<//review>

The folks at Santa Clarita Auto Sound were very helpful selecting an awesome sound system for my budget. Had a little glitch or two arriving at the sound shop when the installation was finished, which Santa Clarita Auto Sound promptly fixed... Got in my conveyance and turned the system up LOUD with some hi-fi jams, and a big smile spread across my face hearing the GREAT sound. Getting in my conveyance without a sound system meant non-stop fits of road rage. Now, getting in my conveyance is a joy, and the mellifluous sounds coming from the system Santa Clarita Auto Sound installed always puts a smile on my face. A little thing or two I wanted adjusted, and Henry offered to do it for free.< /Text>

<review>Went in to get my sound system checked because there was a weird noice . They charged me 75 dollars just to tell me it was the wiring but that in order to fix it I needed a whole new radio 🤔. I went to a different place and they fixed it for 50 dollars . I wouldn’t recommend Santa Clarita Auto Sound they were just trying to get me to spend more than what I needed or could afford 😡. They took my 75 dollars for doing nothing !<//review><rating>1</rating><GmapID>0x80c2870592159c89:0x9a666c267a7fdb22<//GmapID>< userid>

Great customer service. I couldn't ask for a better place to have my car work done at. All the workers treat you like family and are ready to help and answer questions. Everything I have had installed is done with care and works and looks amazing. Great quality work. Great deals. Very timely installs. All in all the best place in town to get your car work done if you want something put in it. Love them. I can’t say enough good about them. Thanks for all of your great work.<//text>

Great service. I had my 2011 car upgraded at Santa Clarita Auto Sound, and they stepped up with good work. Over the year, I had a couple of upgrades made to my car; Stereo upgraded with Apple CarPlay + Android Auto, added Rear parking sensors, backup camera. Followed by Sound Deadening installation which has made the car cabin that much quieter and feel more luxurious !  Excellent customer service by David & Henry for the recommendations and following through to make sure the work was done per my expectations.

I would recommend this place.< /Review>

<Review>Excellent experience using these guys!  I know good work when I see it and their work was superior.  I waited while they installed a radio.  The installation was very clean.  They made all of their wire connections like a surgeon.  No sloppy work done here.  My father used to own a repair shop so I appreciate when work is done correctly.  The owner was a professional and gave me a fare price.  I will recommend my friends here.< /Review>< pictures>

In the past month they installed a brand new fully customized stereo / GPS system (with backup and from camera) to my 2017 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon and also a backup camera to my daily driver a Honda Civic 2012. Both jobs done perfectly and within a very timely manner.

About a week after the install I got a message from Henry to follow-up and see how is everything is going with the new system and backup camera and overall to make sure I'm satisfied - that is really great that they take the time to actually call and make sure everything is working great!

I highly recommend Santa Clarita Autosound for all of your car needs! I will be happy to keep doing business with them in the future and more then excited to recommend them to everyone!

I went in for an issue that I had with an install from a different place. Should have went here from the start. They fixed my engine whine, gave me great speakers in the front and adjusted everything. My radio sounds great now!

I wanted to upgrade my bass system. I searched the web for any good ones when my brother said that why not go to a place that sells one directly. He's got a point though, so I drove around the area to find one. I went in and had a talk with Henry, who seemed to be in charge at that time. He showed me some really cool systems and explained the difference with everything to me. I am impressed at how knowledgeable he is. It is better than having to read them on the web. He also gave his suggestions for my preferences of music. We agreed on his suggestion. They were quick, I got it done in the same day and I'm quite impressed with the results. I am thankful that this was my first choice.</Review>

Finding Santa Clarita Auto Sound is like finding a gold mine.  This place has the nicest, best and most professional guys who work in the car stereo service industry.
I commend them for everything they did for my car. They were the ones who installed a brand new audio system, complete with amps, subwoofers and speakers. Aside from this, they gave my car a remote start, alarm and a high-tech navigation system. I got all of them on a reasonable price.

These guys completed each installation project with great efficiency. They gave full attention to details to make sure nothing could go wrong. They took good proper care of my car. They left zero marks or scratches after every job. Most of all, they were fast. When I left my car to install the brand new audio system and later that day, I was able to drive my car back home while listening to music using the newly installed audio system.

I really like the results they have given me. In fact, I have been recommending them to my friends and acquaintances. And those who took my recommendations thanked me for telling them about Santa Clarita Auto Sound.

Overall, I have found the best car stereo installation service in California!</review>

<Review>I bought my car from Southern California (for some reason it is always cheaper in Cali) and it did not come with the premium sound system in it, so I really needed to upgrade it. I love listening to music in my car, plus I drive around 30 minutes to get to work usually. I am sure people who drive a lot know the importance of the music while driving, especially if you drive at night time so it keeps you awake.

Anyway, I wanted to upgrade my whole sound system, plus navigation system and a backup camera because mine was a basic model that did not come with any of that. I knew I was going to spend a lot of money, I just needed to find a place that could do a quality job.

I did a lot of research and found 2 shops. Santa Clarita Auto Sound was the one that was very flexible with scheduling and their prices were lower than their competitor. This particular shop was a little bit far but in the end, it was definitely worth it. They gave me a detailed quote and all the prices on phone. That was the last shop I called, after what I decided to make an appointment. They installed new speakers, two subwoofers with a custom box, amplifier and a navigation system with a backup camera. I got a very good deal for all that and they took only 1 day to finish the job. These guys did a great job. I just love the sound in my car and I really enjoy listening to music now, don't even want to compare it with the sound that was in my car when I bought it. These guys truly have a passion for what they do and are very knowledgeable.

By the way I've already recommended this shop to all my friends and wanted to leave a note here too.</Review>< pics>

<Review>I have been an extremely satisfied customer of Santa Clarita Auto Sound (SCAS) since 2012.  A family owned and operated establishment.  I have gotten sound systems installed in me and my son's cars.  From customized equipment to the perfect sound system based on car size, the SCAS team takes time to understand your needs and wants and are committed to finding the right audio solution FOR YOU.  I appreciate each their integrity levels, skills, and service which is the benefit of being raised together as brother and sister.  Keep elevating SCAS team!  Peace.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I got a brand new car (2015) and decided I wanted a car alarm installed. I drive pass this place every day and decided to go check it out. I did my research on car alarms and prices before going in. They were up front and honest about the process and price. I was told it would take 3 hours to install my alarm and it only took 2. I was told if I had a problem with it to bring it back and they would fix it for free. I've had it for 4 months and there hasn't been a problem. Everyone was nice and courteous. I would definitely recommend this place, in fact I have to my co-workers.< /Review>< username>

We wanted to get a home theatre for a long time and my friend reffered me to use Santa Clarita Auto Sound. He installed a stereo system in his car here. They did it in less than 3 days. It's been a month and everything works great. Thank you guys a lot.</review>

A good thing about Santa Clarita Auto Sound is that they're very easy to communicate with. The last job that they've done for me waswhen my father want a new car stereo for his old car and he asked me if I knew someone or some company who could get the job done. So I recommend Santa Clarita Auto Sound because they did a great job on my car 2 months ago. So we drove into Santa Clarita Auto Sound's shop and they did some talking to my dad and they made a deal. A team of professional worked on my dad's car, and dad said that he can’t wait for the result. As expected, they installed all the sound system and car stereo perfectly.  It sounded nicely!  Another job well done for Santa Clarita Auto Sound.< /text>

<text>Recently, I have spent quite a bit of time at Santa Clarita Autosounds. First they installed a fancy radio but sadly it was stolen from my car (in my garage!). What is wrong with people??? So they installed another lovely, very fancy radio in my car. Both radios were excellent!!! It was fast and easy to schedule the installation(s). They explained the radios clearly and I could actually work them. No small feat for me. I've been back two times, once to adjust the audio on the hands-free and again to have them pair a new phone with the radio. In both instances they walked out and did it on the spot and told me (with a smile!) there was "no charge, it's just part of the service". They are totally professional and able to give very clear, easy to follow directions. In general, I'm intimidated by these sorts of places and on first glance I was here as well. These folks look very serious, but you are greeted immediately when you go in the door and they are very interested and helpful. I'm just not a tech savvy person but they were undaunted and quite patient. By the end, I felt pretty smart and competent......and there was not charge for that either! If you're in the market for audio, you can't go wrong here. I can't say enough nice things!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2870592159c89:0x9a666c267a7fdb22< /Gmap_id><Time>1402170089170<//Time>< username>

Absolutely love my new sound system. They have friendly staff and provided prompt service. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is my car was returned to me dirty. My car is black and I keep it spotless. It had finger prints all over the trunk and spoiler (due to installing Satellite Radio And back up camera), large smudges on the windshield that appeared to be elbow prints, and a water ring on the roof from someone's drink! Seriously?
Other than that, I'm very pleased with everything purchased. It feels like a new car with all the upgrades.</Text>

Had a really good experience with these guys. It's been more than 2 years I use them. First, they made a custom box for me (that's something to see). Then I brought my wife's car for a backup camera. Couple of weeks ago installed an alarm system and a window tint.
I use them so many times and they have never given me a reason to turn to another place.  These guys know how to keep customers. KEEP IT UP!!!< /Review>

To me this is the best shop for alarm systems in Santa Clarita. Got an alarm installed in my Jeep last week here. I'm very happy I could get this deal, they gave me a good price both for the unit and for the installation, plus they are the only preferred Viper dealer in Santa Clarita, so I know I'm safe in case something happens :)</Text>

<Response>{'time': 1528310174882, 'text': "Hello, thank you! I'm grateful that you like our service. I apologize for any confusion. The troubleshooting was a separate charge because we took the stereo out and tested all the wiring for the entire sound system. We did upgrade the components speakers for you which is a separate installation. See you next time."}< /Response>< Text>
The did an excellent job and did it very quickly. I have only 1 complaint. I brought my car in because there was a short in the system which was not originally installed by them. The charge was $150 to find the problem and fix it. Once they found the short in my passenger door speaker they suggested replacing the speakers as the models I had were not so good. I agreed and bought a set for $275 they then told me it would be $95 to install then new speakers I said shouldn't that be covered by the $150 charge since the labor to remove my door panels was already done they would not go for that. So the moral of my story is if I walked in and said replace my speakers the cost would have been $125 cheaper for the same service preformed. I will say they do a very good job and I would return in the future.</Text>

I can't live without my remote start, love being able to operate it from my smart phone no matter where I am. Much more personalized service than I've experienced at other stores and I don't have to worry about the quality of their work. I also feel better shopping at a family owned business that'll put that money back into the community especially since the price is comparable and selection exceeds other places.< /review>

<review>I had a Kenwood stereo installed in my Toyota Corolla back in 2012 and I have been very happy with it.

Then Installed the antenna mount. The trunk install was done with the USB port easily accessible for laptop frequency programming , they ran the speaker wire back up to the front seat and placed a switch in the center console to go between the stereo and the 12V speaker So I choose to listen to the stereo or the Ham rig or both at the same time.  Clean install! It looks factory. No problem with it for two years. They tinted windows on three cars for me and installed a Boom Box in my son's Benz then tinted his windows. I used a gift certificate they offer for my son. I like this shop it is clean and well laid out, the work bays are clean and organized. I send friends there and purchase gift certificates for friends.
They have a lot of Product lines. No Ham Radios or Scanners but they did  the best install on a Ham rig I have seen in 30 years. I just explained that it puts out several watts on transmit, made sure to go over wire choice and location, it was ready in three hours.  AC6AV</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

<review>Yea I'm not coming back here. I came here to get a car alarm with installation. I walk in and 3 people are behind a counter just staring at me not saying anything. So I say "I'm looking to get a car alarm." The guy in the middle says "okay" nothing else. Like a douche bag. The guy next to him comes around to help me but after that I wasnt gonna spend my money there.

Here's a tip to those employees: when a customer walks in you say "how can I help you?" It's pretty easy.

Needless to say they watched $600 walk out that door. Idiots. Never spending my money here.</review><time>1471678131021<//time><Resp>None< /Resp><userid>101237763560096336106</userid><rating>1< /rating><pics>None<//pics><Name>Jessee</Name></record></dataset><record>

I have upgraded my car stereo with Pioneer AVH-270BT and it works well for me. The Sound is too good and you can play music with anything. Had a great experience of Listening music in my car. The Technicians made the installation smooth and described me the functions of my new stereo so gently. I can’t imagine myself without this stereo system while driving. My Family loved it so much. Thanks to Santa Clarita auto Stand.</text>

About a year or so ago, I had Morel brand speakers installed to replace my factory stock front door panel speakers. I was told they were custom designed for my BMW.  A few months later, my window tint on my left window was damaged because the speaker was scratching it. I had them re-position the speaker and repair the window tint - which they did for free (I later had the tint re-done by someone else because the work was poorly done). A few months after that, I had work done by Al & Ed's in Canoga Park because one of my Morel speakers stopped working. Turns out one of the cross-over wires became disconnected and after pulling the panel they took pictures and showed me how Santa Clarita Auto Sound basically Jerry-rigged the installation using pieces of wood in order for the door panel to be pulled away so the speakers would not block the path of my window regulator. They even put pieces of carpet taped on the back of the speaker magnet so the tint wouldn't be scratched.  Seriously? Custom made for BMW, huh? I'm having the speakers replaced next week.

For xmas bought stereo / amp / trunk subwoofers for son’s car.  Very knowledgeable on what would work best in car, scheduled install for right after xmas.. problem with module after installed, they immediately ordered new part got in right away and fixed issue.  Works great.  Have had them do all stereos/installs in all my cars never anything but highest quality service.  Would not go any other place.</text>

<review>Good Experience!!!! Tried Kicker 43TCWRT84 subwoofer. I am a hardcore music lover. With my existing car speakers , the sound was good, but I wanted to add some more bass in my car.Seems like I have  Incorporated style with power from Santa Clarita Auto stand. My friends are getting crazy for it. The Marvelous experience of listing music while driving to an office or home. The Sound quality is amazing. At last, it was a good deal for me .Really loved it. Thanks.<//review>< Time>

Being a touring musical technical professional, with a focus on guitar system configuration, I ended up cursed with an extensively trained and absurdly finicky ear. I was never satisfied with any system configuration or tuning that I had assembled or had installed in my vehicle(s). So when it came time to, again, attempt to satisfy my craving for flawless audio in my vehicle, I shuddered. Along came Henry at Santa Clarita Autosounds. I went in. I met Henry. I was jaded and apprehensive. I gave the short speech about what I do for a living, etc. and postured myself (rather arrogantly, actually) as an educated consumer, not to be swindled. I stated what I wanted and a budget. I was stunned at the response. I was greeted with something that I hadn't experienced before. Ears. This guy was actually LISTENING to me. I couldn't believe it. Henry was patient, professionally consultative (which I really related to and quite liked) and funny. No "close 'em" attitude at all. He went to work, exploring and explaining options that all fell within my stated preferences. I settled on a system and took a chance. Boy, am I glad I did. I (and my pesky ears) have never been more satisfied or happier with the result. Henry has never played any sort of games with me. And believe me, I would know. He is courteous, professional and put the stuff in (and tuned my vehicle's audio response - really cool) in a timely manner and pleasantly within budget. I highly recommend this business.< /text>

<text>Friendly service, fast installation, and knowledgeable staff made the installation of the system in my car by Santa Clarita Autosounds a great first time experience. Installation of the receiver and 4 speakers took just over an hour. The installation fee was significantly lower compared to other quotes I received; especially from one of the Big Box Stores. I will return in the near future to have my headlights upgraded to HID. I know my car will be in good hands and that there will be $$ left in my budget.< /text><rating>5<//rating>< pics>

I am quite happy with the new Pioneer AVH- 4100NEX and two-way alarm Viper 5704V. Both are amazing products.

My stereo broke a few weeks ago and I went into the store since I always see it on my drive to work.The sales guy Henry really helped me out. He helped pick out what I needed and they really got my car in and out super fast. I was expecting it to be a pain with the scheduling and all but it was in and out on the same day. This place is good.<//Review>

Describe my experience, it started all most a year ago. The moment I purchased a stereo I had nothing but problem with the system shutting it's self off, brought it back they replaced some wire's to fix the problem, did not work, I brought the car back again to see if I could purchase another stereo and pay the difference (upgrade) they said they could not do that and I should sell mine on Ebay and pay for a new stereo or send it back to the manufacture (we sent it back). Got my stereo back it is working fine BUT they did a bad job re:installing, the frame of the stereo kept popping out and the center counsel puckered had to take the car back again and before I forget they forgot to put the trunk lining back! I would not go back and my center counsel is still not to my liking!!!!!!!!< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>really the worst. one auto door lock stopped working within a week, and my car went dead that night from miswiring from the alarm installation. this was on an uncomplicated 1968 ford. they also installed speakers which i later found out had to be rewired because of problems.

on top of that, the day of the job they wouldn't even complete the entire job of putting in a hood lock sensor because they didn't want to pay their tech the overtime, even though they quoted that as part of the job which would be done within 3 hours. they expected me to drive back a roundtrip of 50 miles because they didn't want to pay someone overtime for 40 minutes.

i wouldn't even go back to them for the hood sensor, which i paid for, or the broken door lock. that's how bad they are. when i put a review on yelp i received messages from others who had horrible experiences and pursuing legal action. many positive reviews you see are padded...you can tell the real reviews such as this one because of the specificity of what they did wrong as well as how many '1' star reviews there are...that's no accident. plus,  the low prices in their ads are loss leaders. i was extremely upset over the entire experience with these people.<//review>< pics>

I got my new radio/backup camera installed at Xtreme Autosports and it only lasted 6 months after the warranty expired, they didnt really offer any kind of solution for this, so now the money I spent is down the drain.

I had ordered and had installed by them, a 2 speaker Rockford fosgate T1650 coaxial speakers,  JL audio Subwoofer, and 4 door+ floor sound deadening. They did a professional and clean install. I am very happy with their service and work, and would definitely come back to their shop for any car audio work.</text>

I waited a little while to calm down before writing this. Having said that, I still WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place even it was the only one in town. There are other places around town that deserve your business more than this place, believe me! So as not to insult anyone, even though it is well deserved, I will just stick to the facts. Within the past few weeks I had tint service performed here on my car. I called around to get estimates before choosing a place. This place was more expensive than any of the others I called. But they gave me a 20% discount over the phone and could get me in the same day, so I went. I had the tint installed, but I had to bring it back the next weekend to have them replace some tint film that had been scratched during installation.

After getting my car back the second time, I went home and the car literally stayed parked in the garage for two days. On the third day I decided to wash the car, which is when I noticed hard impact paint damage under the front bumper that appeared to have been touched up by a shoddy paint job. I'm not talking about a few small scratches either. So I took the car back in to show them the damage. The person I dealt with the whole time was.....let's just say the person was family to the owner. My experience with this person got really ugly. After a long debate with this person about how my car could have been damaged, I decided to agree to disagree and I would just voice my displeasure through he channels I have as a consumer. I was calm as I could be the whole time (but SO not happy), and I even told this person I was leaving because we were not going to agree. But this individual kept trying to disprove the notion that they could be responsible. That's when it got ugly.

All of sudden, as if a switch were flipped; this person was pointing at me in a hostile manner. I advised this person to stop and they complied, but then went on to raise their voice and call me crazy. Well, I wasn't letting this go by, so I said.....well, let's just say we said good bye to each other with some profane expressions. This was as bad as a customer service experience gets.

Now, I can't prove they did this, but I left the car in their possession and came back later. So, I'll let the reader draw their own conclusion. What would you think if you took your car into a place for service and got it back in different condition than you are certain you brought it in as? Yes, I did write the owner and I have not heard anything from him. But, I'm not surprised. It is so hard to find just GOOD customer service, I'd even settle for average service. So sad!!! You can risk it if you want, but I don't know why.<//Review>

⚠️⚠️!!BUYERS BEWARE!!⚠️⚠️
I came into this establishment to install a system in my cars my car was already pre wired due to the previous owner. The previous owner ran the system with no problems and hadn't needed to buy a new battery.
Saturday I went in to have it installed I told Henry that the car was pre wired and I asked him if anything needed to be replaced to let me know because as much as I don't want to spend the money I want it done RIGHT. They came back and said that it would cost 50$ to replace wiring behind my radio so I paid and Throughout the installation I asked Maral and Henry if everything was ok and if anything needed to be replaced or changed they insisted however, that everything was "Working Fine" with no suggestion the the current wiring was unfit for the services. Installation went as expected and I drove an hour back home that night, but before I could get off to my EXIT I started to smell what I eventually found out was a smoking speaker and my radio would shut off and come on at random. When this came to my attention I called the establishment. 5 times at 1813 to let them know I needed to come back and have the service replaced but no one answered however I was able to get in contact with David via google business messages he assured me that my life wasn't in danger and that I should have them take a look at 1000 on monday.

Monday came and I was there at 1000 as instructed from there I gave Henry the keys to take a look and less than 30 seconds later he came inside the store saying that there is something wrong with my battery, after asking what he did to my car and telling him that I have 0 problems starting my car (he too had no problems starting my car Saturday)and that my battery is fine, I went out and it STARTED with NO PROBLEMS like a brand new model. So I went inside and asked Maral if David can take over looking at my car as Henry is essentially being untruthful. After going back and forth with all 3 of them when I was speaking to David they asked if I wanted to talk to a reference of theirs who has a problem with Battery Terminal Corrosion they also had interstate write a note stating they needed to replaced so after SC Autosound "fixed" the sound system and replaced the subwoofer (They Offer No Warranty, No Refund) I went to a nearby automotive mechanic and had the terminals replaced hoping that everything was good to go and I would return for more services.
By the time I got home again the sound had yet again went out but this time no smoke. So I called spoke to Maral and she instructed be to come back so I did and made it there around 1630 but they close at 1800. They again looked at my car but this time they said that I would need to buy a new wiring 39-59 from my battery (the same one that Henry said "works fine" but made no suggestions to replace) and pay for the 65$ labor after I already spent 420.47 just to get this far and that I would have to return tuesday to get the work properly done as they "didn't" have enough time.
I wouldn't trust recommending  this company with a pet fish as they obviously don't thoroughly check their work nor the welfare of components pertaining to the Autosound assignment and don't take responsibility for their faults.
David also disagreed that when doing mechanics and electronics on cars disconnecting of they battery isn't needed which is NOT CORRECT. Any good car mechanic of any kind knows to disconnect at least one terminal of the battery when maintaining certain duties such as the expected.
Monday night would have been the time to pull in some extra hours and get things right with the customer (at little to no charge) as it never was from day 1 but instead I was expected to drive home and back to the establishment to pay full price for services that should have been done day 1. I will make sure I nor anyone else I know spends another penny with them as this company is not to be trusted. Other customers that I came in contact with while waiting for my car to be done and abroad can agree as well so the 4.5 stars they have now are fluffed.</review>

I really like this shop! A different shop had really screwed up my car & they fixed it for me. Santa Clarita Auto sounds has my onstar still working perfectly & they even added my factory steering wheel radio controls to the pioneer navigation system I got from them. I was going to purchase online, but with the great labor price they gave me, I ended up spending about the same amount anyway. The other shop I went to didn't even offer an onstar adapter or an adapter for my steering wheel controls. I didn't even know I had those options. Would highly recommend this shop to others!</Review>

<Response>None</Response><Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>Normally I shop around for the best price on everything I buy, but after buying speakers from Santa Clarita Autosounds I refuse to shop anywhere else. They always give me awesome prices, they have a great selection of top of the line brands, and most importantly, they have excellent customer service. The helpful staff is really what keeps me going back whenever I need parts. Henry is a great guy to deal with. He's got tons of knowledge and has no problem sharing it. He's always got time to answer all my questions and point me in the right direction with product and mod advice. While building my system up I wish I had started at Santa Clarita Autosounds instead of wasting time at less helpful shops.</review>< user_name>

<gmapID>0x80c2870592159c89:0x9a666c267a7fdb22< /gmapID><text>Crap. Staff working there hardly knows about any of the products they sell. They sold me a subwoofer that was too weak for the amp (which doesn't make sense to me, you'd think that could only happen the other way around, but I'm not the professional), which burned out the sub within a week. When I take it back that's what they tell me. The sub was too weak. Oh, the sub YOU recommended to me isn't compatible with the amp you also sold to me? Great.

Staff was also quite rude when I asked them to look at an old sub I had. I told them the person who gave me this second-hand sub said it was a $300 sub. They laughed at me and said no, it's definitely not. Very professional.

They installed the sub in my trunk and forgot to clamp/bolt it to the backseat. I had to ask them if they bolted it and the guy seriously says this; "Oh, you wanted it mounted to the backseat?" No, I wanted it to be sliding around my trunk until something punctured it. Now here's the kicker, they did this the first time AND the second time when I had to get it replaced due to their screw up.

The only reason this crappy place gets 2-stars is because the actual installing staff did a good job, I mean my car hasnt blown up from incorrect wiring and the sub *does* work. But the front-end sales staff is god awful.< /text>< Response>

<text>I've never written a review but I'm really upset with the customer service and broken promises of this business. I bought headrest DVD players. I told the manager they were for long trips away with my family he said 650 out the door. But it was not I was charged tax turned out to be $700. three weeks later went on a trip 20 minutes on the freeway they stopped working. He had set them up to the FM radio. According to other businesses i could have done this myself. it wasn't set up threw the car. He said he would see what he could do and sorry that they did no returns. Months have gone by of me calling and calling. just recently he told me it be another $200. this is so ridiculous. I could have got the factory DVD players set through my car dealer for $1,000 and he knew this. I will never buy anything there again. I don't recommend  this place to anyone< /text>< date>

<review>Henry & David helped to install new head unit and speakers in my CRV 2010. All the connectors (bluetooth mic,  radio antenna, dim settings) are connected well and functioning properly. David recommended kicker speakers CSC67 with 25% off deal. Kicker speakers sound great compared to original stock speakers in my CRV.  Cost of the parts and installation is priced reasonably.<//review>< pictures>

<username>Dickfuck420 Playlists<//username><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>BEWARE!!! DONT GO HERE!!!Terrible service. Missing tabs, panels not screwed in, and 2 interior lights not working after install. They refused to acknowledge it was them and insist the 2 bulbs went out. They even have video of interior pre install that proved it but they claim it's too blurry to tell. I had to buy the 5$ tabs to replace the ones they obviously lost. PATHETIC they wouldn't shell out the chump change to satisfy the customer. Static-y sound coming from audio, and sound level is really low for having an amp. Wish i wouldve just had bbuy do it for 50 bucks more. I had this exact system installed on a car before, and this sounds nothing like it.

The work they did was ok. It was the best price "Quote" i got anywhere so i went to them. They gave me a price for the viper car alarm over the phone which include instillation, then when i was there they told me i also need this other part thats $100 for the remote receiver to work! what!? thats like giving a low ball price and then jacking it up when i get there, for it to work!!! not cool. it also took 2 days after i dropped it off in the MORNING and was told a few hours!

Other than that, it was okay. Would i go back? maybe, but ask all your questions first and make sure its everything cause i consider what they did to be pretty shady!!!!</Text>

<Review>I usually don't take to time to write these reviews but after my recent experience if felt compelled to. If you need any kind of stereo related work done on your vehicle this is the first and only place you should go. It's the only place I'm going to from now on. I used to be loyal to another local shop in Santa Clarita by the name of Xtreme Autosports. They lost all future business and recommendations from me to this place. Went in to get a frayed factory iPod cord replaced on my Mercedes Benz C63, after getting a horrendous quote and poor advice from Xtreme Autosports for $250 labor and $150 for the genuine Mercedes cord making a combined price of $400 just to be able to plug my phone into the cars already standard feature, what a joke. I stopped by this place and was impressed with the very neat, clean, high quality show room and staff SCV Autosound has. After a very short wait was greeted by Henry the owner and asked him to take a look at my situation. Long story short he gave me a very very fair price of $75 for labor and $65 for a Genuine Mercedes Benz iPod cord straight from the local dealer's parts department. Dropped the car off around 9:30am on a weekend and within 2 hours it was already ready to be picked up. The job was performed flawlessly, I was a little scared about any scratches or dents on the factory unit or dash board especially since Mercedes are very complicated to work on at all but everything was spot on. He even left the old cable they replaced in the bag of the new genuine Mercedes cable on the passenger seat as proof I was getting exactly what he sold me. Afterwards I couldn't figure out how to navigate to the AUX input for the iPod to start actually playing my music since the car was new to me. Henry took to time to sit out in the car and figure it out with me and ultimately he did and now I finally have all my music! Hands down recommend this place whether you live in the SCV or not. All the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I'll definitely be back for work on my Lexus and any other friends or family that need stereo help or work are getting sent straight here by me in the future. 110% satisfied. Don't waste your time going anywhere else, especially with Xtreme Autosports (Xtreme Ripoffs)</Review>< pictures>

< review>
I called nearly a dozen places about installing a new stereo/sirius radio system in my husband's car as a birthday present. The guys at santa clarita autosounds were the most straightforward and honest. They didn't push anything and tried hard to understand what I was after. I gave them my budget and they went out of their way to get me the best value possible. They gave me good advice and made me feel as if he could call on them for help long after the sale. Strongly recommended!< /review>

I've been going to Santa Clarita Autosounds for several years and have purchased an alarm system and two full stereo systems for both of my vehicles. David and Henry were extremely helpful and patient with me when making my decisions and setting up my game plan of what to get for my cars. I went several times to check out different combinations over the course of a year without even spending a dime and got full assistance every time until I was ready for installation. Santa Clarita Autosounds does an excellent job with installing their components in such a clean and professional way as to completely compliment your vehicle. Their prices and installation rates are very reasonable. In total, I have purchased two head units, full replacement speakers for two cars, alarm system, and a custom mounted amp nicely concealed in my quarter panel. I will definitely be paying Santa Clarita Autossounds another visit for my subwoofer install down the road and I am looking forward to dealing with excellent customer service interaction with them once again.<//text>

David the owner and staff are AWESOME! I brought my new car to Santa Clarita Auto Sound based on the reviews that I read online. David explained to me in a technical yet simple way I could understand my options to upgrade my factory stereo. I ended up taking his advice and getting a Kenwood Amp, Woofer and installation. I am extremely happy with the entire process. David is a true professional and I found that his professionalism is rare in the industry. I went to several other stereo shops before Santa Clarita Auto sound  and turned away from each of these other shops due to what seemed to me as an industry standard of un-knowledgeable sales people and sales people talking to me as if I dont know anything about sound. David, the owner of Santa Clarita Auto sound appeals real quickly to your senses as a guy who knows sound quality ver y well. He impressed me quickly by showing me that he understood what sound quality I was looking for and explained how he could make that happen in my car. Simple and very professional. Anyway, I couldn't be happier with my Kenwood setup. It was a great decision and money well spent. You will be very well taken care of by David and his crew if you buy here. Five stars all the way around. Highly, recommended!< /text>

I love this place when I go in and order. But ordering online or over the phone, I never get what I order. Today I ordered a large bowl, rice 2 scoops of salmon and a scoop of spicy tuna, no sides, ademame, bacon bits, garbanzo and almonds. Somehow I got a salad.<//Review>

You can email me directly through our website for correspondence. Thank you for bringing this to my attention."}< /response>< time>

OMG!!! The food was AMAZING! Great portion amounts, very fresh ingredients, the sauces are to die for. We tried 3 different places, in 3 days. Pink Fish wins hands down. I drive 25 minutes to get there, well worth my time and gas. The workers are kind. Thank you so much. TERRIE ANDERSON.<//text>

Came in to order everyone was in the kitchen talking. A lady came out and made my order. It was expensive which was okay had it been edible. I threw it away. I don't ever remember food being so bad I threw it away. I guess there is a first time for everything. There wasn't a clean table to sit at even though I was the only customer there in the place. It was dirty and none of the employees could stop chatting in the kitchen long enough to come clean a table to sit at. It will not stay in business at this rate. Don't waste your money.<//Text>

Great place but sometimes they should just place the food on the plate and serve. They take to long even as you are looking as they prepare. Simple is faster and better.< /text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Looked very appealing and beautiful, however once I dug into it, the entire dish became utterly disgusting. The cucumbers lacked any sense of taste or crunch, the seaweed tasted as if I grabbed it out of the ocean and started eating it just like that, the salmon chunks tasted absolutely fishy and the textures of the dish were all wrong. 15 minutes after eating half of the dish, my stomach got upset and I had to fight the urge to vomit.<//Review>< response>

<Review>I LOVE THIS PLACE! They truly care about the quality and service for their costumers. Menu is perfect, they have something for everyone. Very helpful service in constructing a beautiful poke bowl.  The CLASSIC SAUCE & THAI TEA is BOMB. The girl named Jedi is the coolest and sweetest worker. She made my bowl making experience a memorable one. I will be coming back again soon :D< /Review>< Date>

<Review>Went to this location for dinner at 6:00pm an hour before they close and customers were waiting outside the door saying that the employees closed the doors and they were taking their break. Will not be back to this place, this was my first time coming here. Not a first good impression. This visit was on 11/01/2020, and not Halloween.</Review>< Pictures>

Service was horrible! I’ve been coming here, a lot - had 4 filled cards. I have never experienced such horrible service until today! The server kept going in the kitchen while making my bowls. When asked for a topping she tells us, “just so you know, bowls don’t get toppings”. I have ALWAYS gotten toppings without an attitude. The cucumbers in my son’s bowl were rotten! I’m so happy Poke Junction on Tierra Subida has reopened. Bye Pokefish!!!</Text>

The staff was very friendly and patient. I had come in during shift change so there was only one person up front but he was willing to go find and restock everything I wanted, even though not all of it was filled up right at that moment. The fish was fresh, the food was delicious and it was way better priced than the traditional sushi place across the way. I got a two side, two protein bowl and a taro tea for less than $15, at dinner time. I would definitely eat there again!<//text>

Great selection of add ins, the sauces were excellent, the salmon and shrimp were flavorful. My normal poke place in Palmdale was closed and wanted some poke so I thought I'd give this place a try. The pink rice is good, pretty much just white rice, but point in color but it's fun. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.</Review>

<review>Very tasty and unique from other Poke restaurants. You have four "base" options, including their signature Pink Rice, and you can mix them. Eight protein, fish, options and lots of sauces, sides and fixings (toppings).  Each time I have been here I had something different by just changing one or two proteins, the sauce, sides or toooings. My new favorite lunch spot on Saturdays.<//review>< response>

Nice to find a place for a delicious calorie/ nutrition conscious meal while on travel. Staff was friendly, food was fresh (I swear my salmon winked at me), and the flavor was bountiful. Not much seating options when busy.</text>

<text>They need to learn how to add sauces to the bowl.  You ask for a drop of inferno and get a teaspoon.    If you do ponzu etc you can have a floating bowl.  I used to order from here every week if not more often.  Now I rarely order food here.  Also every time I ordered online my order was wrong and the cashier just recommended I call to order.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>
{'time': 1539324463450, 'text': "Natasha thank you for your review.  We will work with our bowl builders to get more consistency.  We don't like floating bowls either, believe us we don't like to waste product!  If we are making your bowl in front of you and we add more sauce than you told us to, or add something you did not want,  we have enforced a policy for the bowl builders to remake your bowl to your specifications.  For online orders you can put in the notes that you would like your sauce on the side if desired so you can add the perfect amount to your preference.  I hope you see improvement the next time you return, if not ask for Chris or David and we will definitely take care of you and make on the spot corrections."}< /resp>

Came here about 2 months ago for the first time (co-worker recommendation) and really wasn't sure as it was my first Poke. I got a small dish with pink rice, salmon and crab mix with Nom-Nom sauce. I got back to work to start eating and immediately regretted not getting a larger size. I've been back here probably 5-6 times in 2 months and even brought my wife to try. The Nom-Nom sauce is delicious but that's hardly the only highlight of this eatery. It would be nice if they would cut their proteins into slightly smaller pieces, but I'm just being picky about that. Highly recommend, would and will come here again.<//text>

When we first tried it, it was awesome and we thought we had found our new go to place for healthy takeout. But unfortunately after the first and second time it was all down hill from there. We would previously order online and just go and pick it up with no problem then the order was never right. Ingredients would be missing. Or they never have white rice like they use to before. Or we pre order early for them to call us last minute to say they ran out of white rice (this happened twice). So the next time we go in person instead to find out that there’s no white rice that someone had preordered 🤔 and told that we should call ahead and ask if there is white rice. So we really wanted to not give up on this place so after not ordering here for some time we decided to give it one more chance and we called ahead to first ask if they had white rice, and they said they did. Second it was about 7 pm we asked to place an order in advanced and pick it up at a certain time which was at 8:30pm and they said that was possible. So I arrive a bit early than expected only to find out that there is no more white rice and the worst part was their care free attitude about the whole thing. Definitely not okay. The unprofessional manner of running this place. We are done. It shouldn’t be that difficult to order. Don’t advertise something that’s never available. I get that it’s called pink fish but not everyone wants the pink rice. I should have listened to the previous reviews about never having white rice. This could be a great place but they need to get there menu straightened out. So disappointed. If you want a reliable menu where you’ll always be sure to get what you want and like and not what’s AVAILABLE don’t come here.< /Text>

We are removing less popular items, rearranging the kitchen to fit another rice warmer for the white rice (it's a tight fit back here), and a few other things to address the multiple unintended effects of our extensive menu.  We recognize that we can make things more efficient, less confusing, give faster and better service, increase accuracy, and serve a more consistent product.  Your visits we're a victim of 2 local chefs that wanted to give everything that everyone asked for and before we knew it inventory and menus got a little difficult to manage.  White rice is a perfect example of that since it was never on our original menu.  We do plan to keep white rice after the revision so we hope you give us another shot after April when our new menus are out of production and the crew has been trained on it.  As for the non-chalant attitudes,  that is unacceptable and we will be watching very carefully for the offenders and I can assure you the longevity of any crew member who does not care about the product they send out to the customers they serve has no home here at Pinkfish Poke.  Thank you for your in depth review and I felt like you deserved at least an explanation on your negative experience and to let you know we are already taking corrective measures."}</resp>< gmapID>

Love this place, my favorite poke place in the AV, always good service, never any complaints from me, always leave this place with a smile on my face. The food is great, unique, and I love their Inferno sauce which adds some great spicy flavor to the poke.<//text>

I love pinkfish poke! Everyone is so nice :) and the poke options are amazing! If you love sushi this is the place to go without spending a lot of money, not to mention unlike any other poke place in pancaster/palmdale Pink Fish offers quinoa instead if rice! It doesnt clomb when the rice gets cold !! Super easy to get there and get out and back on the freeway super fast :)< /Review>

<Text>This place is a little gem. It's like the Chiptole of Asian flavor-based sushi bowls. Simple, clean and simply delicious. You kind of have to do a little thinking/choosing, but it's so worth it. The 3-step menu guide above steers you to making your own customized bowl of sushi yumminess. Each one is a unique masterpiece! (or you can order pre-decided flavor profiles so you dont have to think... but you want to think, don't you?!). When you do the right and brave thing to create your own bowl don't panic with all the choices before you. Breathe. Just pick what you like and be confident. You can do this.

I should have taken a pic of mine, but it looked so good I ate it before I could take a picture (that ever happen to you?). This is a little place that has a few inside tables so you can eat there if you like, or great for take out, which I usually do so I can rip into it without people witnessing my unfettered gluttony.

Some advice: they are so generous with their servings I can only finish a small size ($6.95 + tax) bowl so maybe start with that. Fantastic deal for the quality and portions. Healthy and tasty. Always friendly staff and clean location. Go catch you some Pinkfish Poke.< /Text>< userid>

Moved here from LA a few months ago so when this place opened I figured I'd try, they have the best poke in Palmdale area for sure, and one of the better ones I've had in general.<//review>

It's nice to know that we have a new poke place in the Antelope Valley. But my one major complaint is that they advertise pink rice a healthy rice alternative. When I asked the girl behind the counter what it really was she indicated it's just rice with beets mixed in to give it that pink color. In my mind and everyone else's I have spoken to thanks that the word alternative should mean that it's not rice and that it's something like cauliflower,etc.. they do have a choice of quinoa though.<//Review>
<pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1519844958246, 'text': 'To address your concerns I have a 2 part answer.\n\nIf your concern is that our pink rice is a gimmick, I would like to mention many experts consider beets a super food that is high in antioxidants, nitrates, and minerals such as magnesium and potassium.  Our process to make the pink rice is that we take the whole beets and blend them with our house sushi rice vinegar mix and then we cut it into our rice.  I believe this process does not ruin any of the beneficial properties of the beets and improves the  health benefits of white rice. This leads into part 2 of our response since our signature pink rice is a healthier alternative to white rice.\n\nIf the confusion was from our in house artwork, our intent was not to trick anyone into thinking our Signature Pink Rice is not rice.   I see we left out a key word, "alternative to WHITE rice."  We will update our in restaurant artwork as soon as possible to reflect this.  Thank you for the feedback.   I double checked all of our advertising platforms as soon as I read your review.  The only issue is on Yelp and we did not upload the photo of the artwork so we can not remove it. However none of the other platforms seem to be misleading for customers who are looking to be informed on what our Signature Pink Rice is all about. Thank you again, being a new local business, we take all concerns very seriously.'}</Response><GmapID>0x80c259bc3c2f9631:0x5770e99532d7240c<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Like most other comments...I got a message from  Amazon that the package was undeliverable from the USPS (we were home all day!). Went to post  office & they cant find it now.  I've lived in some remote places, but apparently not as backwards as here. No complaints on the guy at the counter (Aaron), he was ok.< /Review>

<text>By far one of the worst post offices I've ever had the misfortune of having to deal with. They've lost countless packages important documents and mail of mine multiple times. Yet again just today they for some unknown reason chose to return to sender a very important package with prescriptions in it even though it was correctly addressed and had only just arrived at the post office the prior evening. With them only being open 4 hours a day I could not get there in 24 hours of the package arriving and so they sent it back!? Like are you kidding me!? This is absolutely the worst postal service I've ever delt with</text>< user_name>

I would avoid having anything from Amazon delivered to a residential address. Even with two day shipping it is handed off to usps and the chances are high you will not get it. There is something seriously wrong with the management of this post office as others have stated.< /Review>

The packages always seem to be returned to sender after being at ths post office for a few hours. Or get delivered to someone else.  It would be a spectacular if the employees didnt steal packages and deliver to whomever they feel without ID<//Text>

Same story as everyone else. Tracking says my package is being held here because they failed to deliver it to the correct post office. Went to my local post office before heading here just to make sure that it wasn't there. The guy (who's actually good at his job and listens to people, unlike everyone here) assured me that he'd finished sorting all incoming packages and that my package was definitely at the Big Bear post office like the tracking info said.

Came here to pick it up, and as soon as I started talking, I was interrupted by a worker named Guy, telling me that there's absolutely no way the package is there. He says my local post office just hasn't finished sorting. As I described above, they most definitely have. Guy then refuses to even take a look in the back and tells me to take it up with my local post office, then interrupts me to call for the next customer.

Absolutely horrendous service.<//Text>

Would give zero stars if I could. Had our post office box here for nearly 17 years and they are consistently LAZY. Only the women and Guy are of any help. Had a pkg delivered there 2 days ago and they, of course, can’t find it, so use every excuse in the book; blaming everyone but themselves. I wish we had residential postal delivery!  I’m fed up with their long lines and uselessness! I feel for anyone who has to put up with this place. Worst post office EVER.</Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I placed an order on Amazon and package was supposed to be delivered on Saturday, which was two days from my order date.  Amazon passed the package to YSPS for delivery.  We were waiting all day Saturday for the package with no delivery.

Usps stated on the tracking information that they attempted and we were not in or the address was wrong.  So I went to the post office on the following Monday to pick up the package.  No package as They returned to the Sender as something was wrong with the address.  They also went as far as to say Amazon does not deliver to Big Bear which is a flat out lie.

So complaint has filed but Doubt if it will Do any good.

If I could give them a negative star rating, I would!!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

If I had an option for negative 20 stars, that wouldn’t be low enough to rate this branch.  Long wait times and losing packages, it’s just god awful.< /Review>

My package was sent here. Not only were people harassed by store employees for going in but they don't answer their phone. I have been trying to recover my package for over a month now, have called over 100 times and no answer.</review>

When using the QR Code, there’s no record meaning they never recorded it. It’s now nearly impossible to find my package.

I would avoid delivering via the Big Bear USPS system at all cost. Classic government inability and mismanagement. It’s an epidemic. Our tax dollars being squandered.

Have rural mailbox two houses away. They over stuff my packages into mailbox and tell me they need signature for packages to be delivered to front door. Packages NEVER COME. I TRACK PACKAGES AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY ARE NOT HERE WHEN THE TRACKING SYSTEM FROM USPS TELLS ME THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DELIVER TO MY DOOR. I'GO TO OFFICE, THEY CANNOT HELP ME I SHOW THEM TRACKING THEY SAID WOW IT'S HERE. AND I HAVE TO WAIT TILL TOMORROW. EXCEPT IT'S SATURDAY AND THEY'RE CLOSED AND I HAVE TO WAIT TILL MONDAY. THESE ARE THE SAME AS PEOPLE.. I WISH I WAS BLESSED WITH A JOB LIKE THERE'S I WOULD DO IT SO WELL. BUT INSTEAD I HAVE TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE PROBABLY OVER THIS QUARANTINE AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE SITUATION.
0 PROFESSIONALISM LESS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND IT ONLY TOOK ME 3 YEARS TO WRITE THIS REVIEW BECAUSE I WANT TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL EVERYTHING MY KIDS GET THEIR PRESENTS FROM THE GRANDMOTHER LATE ALL THE TIME THE ABSOLUTE BEST THING ABOUT THIS  PARTICULAR POST OFFICE IS THAT THEY WILL NOT ANSWER A PHONE I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY HAVE A PHONE LINE THAT I CAN CALL I CALL THE NUMBER LISTED TO THIS OFFICE AND IT GOES TO A 800 CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SPEAK TO A REPRESENTATIVE OR EMPLOYEE. I HATE YOU.</text>

<Review>If I could I’d give them zero stars. They said they put the yellow slip and mail box for a box that came across country and they never did. They lied and sent it back to my moms address. They wait to put out slips a day or so. And sometimes when you have a few packages they don’t put the right amount and will try arguing with you and to lazy to check back unless you threaten to call manager even if you have tracking number.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Similar to the classic film Rudolphs island of broken toys, the bear city post office is big bear own island of tik tarted employees. They have managed to lose just about every important piece of paperwork that I have  needed. If they are trying to show how it felt in the old west days where you will never know if your mail will come because the mail person either died or was mugged by indians, than they are coming close. They prove why government agencies should never have more control over the states.  I don't know if this review will matter because let's face it the staff there is sitting in their own feces drolling and licking the windows. I doubt any of them can read and honestly I would understand if that were the case it would make sense why all my mail has been lost. You guys should quit your job and collect unemployment I'd gladly give some of my paycheck to have you mouth breathers out of that office. Thanks for nothing<//review>

Very poor customer service. This particular Post Office must have more business than they need. Simple request would not be meet and they have an excuse for everything including that this Post Office have private contractors to deliver our mail. This is simply why UPS and FedEx have taken so much business from USPS.</text>

<Text>Needs improvement.  They need to  home deliver to more addresses instead of cramming more PO boxes into their small facility.  The line is typically out the door all day Monday and around closing time all other days.  The employees, while nice enough, are just manning a sinking ship the best they can.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c4b44a8b2c6d2f:0x8b43b6f513838631</Gmap_id></record>

If I could give less stars I would. You can never get ahold of anyone and when you do they assure you your problem has been resolved, only to find out later absolutely nothing has been done to help or assist you. Ive asked the post office three times to leave packages on the porch if they’re too big for the mailbox. I even asked my mail carrier personally face to face to do the same. But god forbid the mail carrier gets off his lazy a** and walks 30 ft to the porch. And now my Xmas packages won’t be delivered until Xmas eve. Thanks for totally screwing me over. Appreciate it, glad you didn’t work too hard!

Have a wonderful Christmas!< /review>

The most incompetent idiots in Big Bear work here. Every single package we get, gets refused. These invalids can't tell the difference between big bear city, or big bear lake. They don't even have the competence to check box names or numbers, they just blindly refuse packages. Not sure how these people even breath, they can't think on their own two feet.< /text>

<review>Work post office ever. Never had or herd so many packages getting lost. Or the famous “it’s here but we can’t find it” excuses. Plus the old man with the white hair has the worst attitude when he can’t find something. Especially when your tracking number says it’s here, or is been here. This place is a joke<//review>< rating>

i called and spoke with Tiffany. She was AWESOME!  I called in about address change and expected no service, but Tiffany was so nice! she took the time to explain EVERYTHING to me and didn't make me feel rushed.  and she told me all these great things that the post office does too! Which I never knew about.  she is wonderful and very informative.< /Review>

<Text>The folks that run the marina👌🖤 friendly and very helpful , I had family drive up from LA and Camp for a week , the only drawback was we weren't able to barbeque no fires , which was understandable , if I had to gripe about anything ranger / police , I'm a veteran with certain disabilities , because of those disabilities I have a pass that allow me free access to all California State Parks 🤔 it's a card the size of a credit card , police had something to say , way don't you have a receipt, I wouldn't want you to end up with a ticket 😡 at every access booth to every state park I've been to they don't give you anything to place on your dash 😡 all and I would go back ,< /Text><response>None<//response><Name>Earl Rhodes</Name><pics>None<//pics></record>

Nice campground. Lots of trees. Full hookups. Coin showers. Some trails. AT&T is very spotty but Verizon seems to work fine. Lots of deer!< /review>

<time>1528244793185</time><rating>4<//rating><review>Beautiful spot, nice big camp site, large fire pit, lots of trashcans, picnic tables and barbecue pits. we were in the bloomer group camp it fits 70 plus campers. Also comes with bathrooms (no running water or electricity) and horse shoe pit. The hike to the camp from the water is about 350/ 400 ft from the water. So it takes trips to get all your stuff up and down the hill. Very private camp literally no one around. We had a mountain lion come 100 ft away from our camp at different times throughout the night.  Our experience was over all good, next time we will bring some means of protection. Also this camp cost $20. A night. Awesome!!!<//review>< pics>

Make sure you park only in designated parking spots, otherwise you will get a $71.50 ticket if you're parked just slightly off the road. They're jerks here at the park and don't tell you this until after they give you a ticket.< /review>

Only been here once... It's ok. The pandemic made it so there's little room to be in-line inside... I thought they would sell the flavored waters/teas they have in the back... But nope... So that was a bit of a let down... Deducting one star for that... Parking in the back is small, but there's a big parking lot right next block.<//Text>

<review>The vast majority of the time my experience at this location has been just fine. I find it’s easiest to call ahead and order so it is ready when I arrive. The app is great on paper but doesn’t work well most of the time, so I’ve stopped using it.  The smoothies are great, but they do tend to close early.  I once showed up 15 minutes before closing and the doors were locked.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUvxloIinThk3Ni3TC1X2nEL55iABKDWRhOLD_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2Fo-bU-HCJObT_sQmEFW5Yy9bz8NtCKwM5qEA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOvKO5KsBSJxg14kDfEXtgla7gV-VFEOPBNqjS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO43eu7Y0bplrg0uw5ib5Fd4RZnLCWMxlCL4iGQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTUeKqap4e-to4HVUJi5SKEiA5bHpYHYETEeuj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNspror1DNxzH3VCqFQAtrFwFCZze4eyrCVuk6I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1521211628075, 'text': 'Wow, Michael!

I love this Jamba Juice always place my online order to go. However today I wasn’t greeted when I came inside was told to wait a moment. I waited 3 mins still nothing. Employees need to be trained on better customer service. She Didn’t apologize for making me wait on an order that was placed 15 mins prior. I asked for my drinks and left because as I was exiting she made sure to address the customer after me. Please do better with some of the staff not all before you loose customers.<//Review>

I put in mobile orders and, while they are ready when I arrive, no one is actively taking care of that line.  When I indicate that I have placed a mobile order, the first thing someone will say, without asking my name, is" We're working on it. "  Each time I have to say that I put it in 15 minutes earlier.  A different person will then look in the fridge and find it ready to go.  I've just decided to stop coming to this location, period.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Their bowls are on average $3 cheaper than all the other places you can get a smoothie bowl when you're too lazy to make it yourself.< /Text>

You can find parking in the back but there's only limited spots. Otherwise street parking. They have some tables in the back friendly staff.
It's a chain, but prices are somewhat pricey< /Review>

This is the most poorly maintained Jamba Juice I think I've been to. It doesn't look like anyone cleans in here ever and it feels like it's in disrepair. There's exploded fruit on the ceiling and tons of dust and grime everywhere. All the other businesses in the area are pretty nice... bummer.</text>

It was supposed to open at 8 am, and we waited until 8:10 am with no avail. A little fraustrating. It didn't even look like anyone was there prepping the store. All machines were off and all the chairs were still stacked. This manager needs to get their act together.<//Text>

< Review>
I bought a Medium suitcase, carryon and a leather bag from Away less than a year ago (from the Los Angeles store).  I was in London a few weeks ago and the handle on my Medium suitcase jammed.  The London store was AMAZING and couriered the new part, with instructions, to me in London, same day.  No cost to me.  I could not have been more thrilled with this level of customer service.</Review>

I bought the carry on and medium suitcases in white about six months ago. I made the purchase through the website, and everything went as smoothly as can be. Delivery came earlier than expected, and the suitcases were in perfect condition. I've used the carry on the most (since I travel mostly for work), and it's been much better than I'd hoped. It carries more than you'd think and the battery/charger is so convenient. Slowly, scuff marks had been building up, and it really took a beating on this last trip. So I pulled out a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, as suggested, and started cleaning it. I was shocked at how quickly and how well the suitcase cleaned up. The attached pictures show the before and after of 5 minutes of cleaning (with one side of the case being the before and the other the after, both having very similar marks). There are still a few deeper, darker scuffs, but I think they'll come out with a more concentrated cleaning. Besides, it's white; I expected it to get a little banged up. It's amazing how little that has happened, though. Thoroughly recommend this luggage. It's fantastic and well worth the money.</Text>

They also have different types of personalization for your chosen bag or suitcase. This is a pricey store, but well worth the money. The service is personal, helpful and friendly. If they have parking, I didn't see it, there may be some in back. There is meter parking on Melrose Avenue.< /review>< Date>

These five stars reflect both Away as a company and my experience at the LA store. When it was suggested to me to spend over $200 on a carry-on bag after I grew up with $50 discount store bags it seemed excessive. We decided to give it a try and went ahead and ordered the first generation carry-on not long after launch. We loved the bag so much that as soon as they released their large bag we went ahead and ordered the generation one large bag as well. Fast forward a few years and I am in need of an additional carry-on bag. I saw that Away started producing aluminum luggage and when I saw it came in a half the price of all the aluminum suitcases I avoided over the years I went ahead and made the purchase. It is absolutely stunning. While there I was speaking with the team members about our other two away bags and when I mentioned one was giving me trouble with the lock, they suggested I bring it in. They tried to fix it but were unable so they went ahead and replaced the bag for me under the lifetime warranty. If we weren't customers for life before we definitely are now. Finding honest customer service to stand by their product is rare today. Away hits the perfect spot where the price is still achievable for most people but the product and service are that of a much more expensive bag.<//Text>

Amazing customer service and warranty on the products. Being able to charge your stuff on the go is a game changer - also works great as a portable charger u can throw in your bag on the go.</review>

I own ~ 4 suitcases, a backpack and a few accessories from Away luggage. About a week after purchasing the backpack, the zipper broke off.

I emailed customer service about 4 times in a period of a month, with no response. I even asked them to tell me honestly if they can't fix it and so I can find an alternate solution. I asked them to just respond and give me an answer either way - no response to any of my 4 emails. I even emailed the co-founder, Steph Korey, on LinkedIn, with no response.

I guess the toxic environment at Away (as per multiple articles that can be easily searched), extends throughout the company.

Horrible customer experience. We and our family were planning on buying tens of suitcases from Away (1 for each of our family members all over the world), but now, we're dissuading others from purchasing Away as well.

All this because of non-existent customer service. You guys at Away need to pull your stuff together if you want to still have a business in the long run.

My recommendation to others looking at Away. Good products, until they break. If they do break, you're on your own. Hence, keep this in mind when contemplating a purchase on Away.< /Review>

<Text>This store is fantastic! When you enter you are greeted instantly and taken care of the entire time. Claire is by far the best employee to work with. The product is worth every dollar. I flew down to LA just to get new luggage and I am so glad that I did. I highly recommend this company, product, and store. Worth your time!<//Text>< user_name>

<text>Great customer service & no hassle lifetime warranty replacement. I travel quite a bit, at least twice a month & don’t travel light by all means. I had a Zipper failure & the outside shell was cracked (possibly at the airport) after 2 years. Went to the store & within less than 10 minutes, I was out the door with a new luggage replacement.

Thanks Melrose store for a fantastic customer service & quick help!

They recycle their suitcases too which’s a plus!</text>< date>

I had to pop my battery out before gate-checking my bag last week and ended up leaving it on the gate podium.

The luggage is great, not outstanding, but just great. I found them through social media, the luggage has a lot to offer. I used it all around Europe on my trip, and it was pretty flexible to my needs. My 3 stars goes to the service at the store, I was really looking forward to buying my suitcase at the store, but the staff was not attentive. The lady looked like she was bored and wanted to get out of work. She did not show all the features of the suitcase, I had to ask her about the battery and she replied “oh yeah”... next time I’ll buy online, store is pointless.<//Review>

I like the suitcase. It is wearing terribly. I have it in black and the scratches which are white in color are prominent.
I have tried cleaning the suitcase and it still has the white scratches on it. My fabric suitcases look brand new, this looks worn.
I would never buy it in black.
I use it as a carry on most of the time . So the few times it has been checked it got scratched.
I am really disappointed and I shared this with an Away rep and they did not seem to care.<//review>

(Translated by Google) First visit to rumored AWAY. Good or bad brand of the topic. The product lineup is simple, so I think it's best to check the size, color and functionality at the store.

After the purchase, there was a questionnaire request, and when I mentioned a bit of communication with the clerk, I immediately sent an email from the store assistant manager, and I had a very good experience as a total UX.

I'm looking forward to seeing what happens when I use it hard because it's a hard case, but I like it very well so far.

噂のAWAYに初来店。良くも悪くも話題のブランド。プロダクトのラインナップはシンプルだから、店頭ではサイズ感や色味、機能性の最終確認をすればいいんだと思う。

購入後アンケート依頼があって、店員さんとのちょっとしたコミュニケーションについて触れたら、ストアアシスタントマネージャーからすぐメールきたし、トータルのUXとしてはとても良い体験ができました。

ハードケースだからガシガシ使い込んだ時にどうなるのかはこれからのお楽しみだけど、いまのところとても順調で気にいってます。<//Text>

The most honest and straightforward mechanic I have ever visited. I told them my problem and they explained the issue of my car in simple and understandable terms. I thought I was going to have to spend $1500 on a new transmission, but I only had to spend a 1/3 of that. If I had gone anywhere else, they would have tried to charge me the maximum. Great mechanics and wonderful people here.<//text>

Always great personal fast service. We've been coming here you years.
They don't take advantage of you.
No up sell. Infact, if you don't need the service or the car is safe without, he'll tell you.
We've even brought a car in for an electrical gremlin that he solved for us in the parking lot for no cost.
We thought we were going to have to sell that car.
He's worked on our gas and hybrid cars.

He always gets us with a smile and said about the family before getting down to business.

Why can't more mechanics be this caring, honest and trusting</Text>

< Review>
Small little shop off of walls and Scott their works a couple of good mechanics they are well informed and know how to fix late model cars the prices are cheap to moderate they don't really speak too much they just want to know what your problem is on your vehicle and they'll fix it again because I work for IMC autoparts I deliver a lot of parts to them and it seems like they have a quick turnaround time for customers bring a book cuz those guys are not much for conversation I don't like a lot of kids to just play with your phone to your car is ready in your dreams you have to take.

Tom is great and runs an excellent shop. They know their stuff and I've never felt they were taking advantage of me- more often they recommend options to save me money.

They're best if you know what you need. They'll take care of it and that's that, which is great. But I'm not a car expert so occasionally I've asked them to do a general maintenance check, and they had no problem taking a look at everything for me and letting me know what might need work.

Super honest and reliable. Been going here for years and highly recommend them.</Text>

Precise Auto Repair is one of the best car service in the bay area with friendly & knowledgeable team. I always ask what everything is and means and they're willing to educate me while the process is in motion. They feel like family and they are so appreciated ☺️< /Text>

I have been going to PAR for years. I love the level and quality of service they provide and the reasonable rates for said services. I take my Lexus' here for oil changes, AC changes, brakes, you name it. I wholeheartedly trust Tom and his staff to do right by me and to take care of me as he would his own cars.

This is my go-to repair shop. They are honest and much less expensive than the dealer. They don't charge for diagnosis. They won't try to rip you off like some other places. They get the job done in a way that is friendly to your pocket.</Text>

Three things to know about David and his team: they're smart, hardworking, and fair. He has pursued issues with our 15-year old C280 several times, not stopping until he found the right (meaning effective AND efficient) solution. And, the ultimate price to fix them was very, very fair. The entire team is highly focused on our needs every time we bring the baby back. With a finicky and wonderful car, you need someone you can trust completely--that someone is David . Plus, his shop dog is the best in town.</review>

<Text>Honest, clear, generous work. I can't recommend this place more. I took car with a snapped timing belt here that would have cost more than the value of the car to fix - against their financial interest, they advised me not to do the repair.

I've been in another two repair shops, where I was almost convinced I need to spend a huge load of money just to keep my car running.    But then I get to Precise Repair and it turns out that my car is completely fine and I just need to apply some minor fixes.   I will return here for sure.< /text>

Great customer service experience.  They talk to you about your car, let you know when there is a real problem, and when it's minor or there is a cheaper solution.  Honest mechanics, and they do good work - I haven't had to come back for repeat repairs on the same issue ever.  Highly recommended.</text>

Came in late morning asking for a brake job front and rear.  Later on, they called me and told me the front pads had some life left - I didn't need to replace them quite yet.  Price was good - way cheaper than dealership, of course - and communication was great.  Thanks!<//text>

< Review>
My wife's 1996, Z28 Camaro was making a loud, irregular, metallic, rattling, sound upon startup last week. This awful sound was coming from beneath the engine. Had to quickly turn off the ignition for fear of more damage. Spoke to Viet in the morning, and had it towed using a flatbed truck to Precise Auto Repair. Since my wife and I really like this car, we were hoping that it was not a broken rod; engine problem because that is what it sounded like. Viet called in the afternoon, and said he had some good news. The problem was that the starter motor's gear housing (next to the front roll drive) was cracked, and a piece of this metallic housing was hitting the flywheel gears as it rotated (yikes). Good news was that nothing was wrong with the motor! We felt like we dodged a bullet on that one!  Viet replaced the old starter with a brand new, Delco, starter which was slightly more expensive than a rebuilt one, but was worth it to me. Thank you, Viet. You are a keeper. Our experience prompted me to write this positive review. This was on Valentine's day, so it was especially fitting.< /Review>

< Review>
It's really hard to find a good mechanic so I was happy to stumble upon Precise.

My first experience was with Viet, who helped me service my van's broken a/c.  Within an hour, I drove out with air again.  I don't remember how much it cost ... Just that I was pleasantly surprised.  While Viet was very down to business, he was also friendly.

Since that time, I've interacted mostly with Tom.  Tom has taken good care of my cars.  He's great at explaining what the plan is, initially, and later, what they did.  If he replaces parts, he typically sets aside the old parts and if he can, he literally shows you why they were defective.  That's a level of detail that I rarely see.

I've had both small and big services since then.  Lately, they replaced my Subaru Outback engine with a rebuild.  Because of the boxer-type engine, the common suggestion is to take your Subaru to a Subaru specialist (either the dealer/mechanic or to a specialist mechanic).  Well, the only specialist I knew of in my area got pretty meh reviews online ... so I had Tom/Precise do it and now my car feels as good as, if not better than ever!

I walked in to their office the other day and overheard somebody saying that they've been with Precise for years and they've moved around the Bay.  And while he currently lives in the _San Francisco_, he and his partner still travel all the way down to Santa Clara/Sunnyvale to get their cars serviced at Precise.

Now, that's loyalty ... and I can totally understand why.< /Review>

< Review>
Great, honest place. I had gone to another place in southern california to get my O2 sensor changed, and the person tried to tell me my radiator was "leaking" and said it also needs to be replaced. I decided to come back to the bay area to get a second opinion. When I came here to get some other O2 sensor changed, I didn't tell them what the other folks said about my radiator, but these people also said the radiator is maybe leaking, but it is a small leak and they just refilled with coolant and told me to keep an eye on it. The price for the O2 sensor change was reasonable and they only charged 6 dollars to refill coolant. I came another time 8 months later to ask if my radiator was leaking and another technician came to look at it, and he also said it wasn't a problem. It's a super tiny leak, and I still had plenty of coolant. So, in summary, both technicians I met were really honest and not trying to get extra money off of changing my radiator (which would be like 800+ dollars), unlike the auto shop in Rowland heights (southern california). Photo shows the tiny leak (red stuff)</Review>

First time customer. Actual price was about 15 percent cheaper than he quoted which is always a nice surprise. Same day service. I'll be coming back< /Review>

<Text>Great place to go!! They always can squeeze me in on the same day when I call and they are fast not to mention very reasonably priced! I now live in south san jose but I still continue to come here for any issues with my car. Highly recommended!< /Text><Date>1441040005181< /Date>< pics>

<time>1519784147290< /time><review>They are good mechanics and they are honest. I've a 2005 Elantra and when I take it to them, I know its in good hands. They tell me when I am panicking without any reasons :) and when really it needs repair. They explain well about the issues and repair that is required. I've been going there for last 3 years now and I don't think I m going to switch as long as I m in the bay area.

It's fine but a bit pricier than others. Oil change was $35. Quoted for brake maintenance that's probably a bit higher than others. Also didn't really need to do it but made it sound super urgent.< /review>

<Review>We always use silver screen for our tattoo and piercings. Stacy and the crew are excellent. They have great prices and you just cant beat the overall experience you get at silver screen. I highly recommend this place!<//Review>< pics>

I love Kathy and Kyle! Great place to have work done... It is the only place I go to and the only place I ever will. No one comes close to the quality of work and cleanliness of this shop! Very reasonable rates and a long time part of the Historical Downtown Oroville Area!</review>

She is the best of the best, and so fast. The space is bright and clean, and she is so kind. I am going to bring some of her business cards to my work. I always used to break out after getting my eyebrows done, until I started coming here. Now my skin around brows is happy after shaping and touch ups😊🌻I don’t have to hide my face from my husband for the first two days after my appointments anymore (break outs)! Highly recommend.</Text>< name>

I happened to find queen threading when I was desperate, my eyebrows were bad. Nikita is amazing!!! she listens and gives great advice. My eyebrows were soo  uneven that she made them look like they were never in a bad shape. I can't thank her enough!! she is an angel! I wont let anyone touch my eyebrows now but Nikita! 100% recommendable!!< /review>

I found Queen threading a Few years back. I came to her when I had a really horrible experience at Glamour brows and when I arrived she took me in right away and fix somebody else’s mistake with my eyebrows that in itself can be hard especially with how my eyebrows first turned out she did amazing job fixing them! I have been coming back ever since , I will not let anyone else touch my eye brows. I have sent a few friends and family members and they are all please with the job she does ! I love Queen threading and will never go else where 💕<//Text>

Ever since the very first time I came to Queen Threading, I’ve always felt very welcomed and comfortable. She always does such an amazing job with my brows and makes sure to tend to my needs each time and listens very carefully to what exactly I want with my brow shape. She never goes thin which is what I always tell her I don’t want and always perfects my brows! She is the only woman I have come to, to do my eyebrows and I have never gone to anyone else in Escondido because she is by far the best one and for a great price!< /Review>

<user_name>Maria Medina< /user_name><Text>Queen Threading has done an AMAZING job . She does her work very efficiently and truly a professional in skills. I'm so PLEASED with my new brows and just wish I would have came to her sooner ! This was my first permanent makeup (Microblading) so I was quite nervous at first but thanks too Queen Threading. I was very much more at ease once she walked me through every step and answered questions I had by taking her time and explaining. I would definitely recommend this place for beautifying their eyebrows needs. They also do eyebrow threading tinting and Henna on brows.<//Text>< userid>

Nikita is very confident and did an amazing job with shape and color of my brows . Now they  look perfect match on my face and never felt so happy also got couple of compliments on it. My both brows were always been uneven and now they are perfect in shape and length. Thanks Again Nikita and Queen Threading for an amazing work on brows.

Nikita was very friendly and understanding - she listened to what I wanted but also gave me her advice. I ended up doing herbal facial and I really LOVE IT. My face look so clear and glowing now. She took the time to waxing my legs and hand as I mentioned about my sensitive skin. Nikita was so gentle but very detail oriented. She made sure I was completely satisfied before I left. Very professional service. I will definitely come back! Highly recommended for facial and waxing!!!< /review>< GmapID>

<Text>I've been Nikita's client for past 3 years. Services provided by her are excellent! I've taken some facial treatments specifically for the marks on the skin, it has significantly reduced due to the excellent treatment provided by Nikita. Other services like waxing, threading, bleach etc. are great. If you are looking for quality service at affordable price, do visit Nikita at Queen Threading.</Text>< name>

I’ve been going here for almost 2 years now to get my eyebrows threaded, Nikita does a good job in shaping my eyebrows making it to look fuller since mine is not really thick. I also go here for brazillian and underarm waxing, Nikita does a very good job! Been going to some places before and I never had a gentle and soft hands as Nikita, she takes care of you and makes sure you are comfortable, explains the procedure well, it helps to lessen your anxiety. She also got competitive prices, overall, I would give her a 5 star and would highly recommend this place. I love love Nikita for being excelent and professional! :)<//Review>

I remember randomly finding Queen Threading and decided to try it out for my eyebrows and underarm waxing. Just went into for my 4th time with her (all time walk-ins) and she was happy to take me (along with my mom and sister!) I plan to continue going here every time I need it!<//Text>

< review>
They make you get dilated or charge you 20$ that's not covered by insurance. Which should be optional. Dr soares can't get a prescription right. Had 3 glasses recheck with no difference. I had to bring in my old prescription that was eight months old from my prior OD. My eye exam was April 27. It has been four months and still have no prescription glasses. Do not waste your time, benefits, and money here. No pateint care at all, the only interest they have is money. I'm out 200$, while they complain that they're out of pocket 600$ when it's their fault they can't get my prescription right. Dr Soares is not too friendly as he seemed angry I was there for multiple rechecks and wasting his time.

The top prescription is from 10/13/20
The bottom prescription is from Dr. Soares. 4/27/2021.< /review>

Always professional and excellent service.  My experience with the staff and Tag have always been 5 Star.  I called the office this last week for something in my eye and I was called back within 10 minutes to find out what was wrong and I was in his office within an hour to remove an eyelash from my eye.  I can't say enough good things about Tag and his staff.  Nicole has had me in for glass adjustment recently and always comes up with the right fit and answers to my situation.  The place to go for me and my family.  Thank you</Text>

<text>In my opinion this is the best Eyecare optometrist in Los Banos because the staff are very caring, professional, friendly and knowledgeable. Dr. Trajan Soares is also the best for the same reason and they have a vast array of frame selection. Their services are top notch.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80917ee21bf8d1e7:0x8b7825f0e72b3eda< /gmapID></record>

I had never been to this Doctor before.  I called in with an eye problem and was seen immediately the same day (within 20 minutes.)  The staff was very welcoming and professional.  The Doctor diagnosed my problem, prescribed medication, explained what needed to be done and set me up for a follow up appointment the next day.  I saw the Doctor for the second appointment, we discussed how to continue treatment of the problem and scheduled a further follow up appointment for the next week.  This was exceptional treatment.  I am so glad I saw them for my eye problem.  I will continue to use Advanced Eyecare Associates for all my future eye care needs.  I highly recommend them for their outstanding care and serivce.  Thank you!!!<//text>

<Text>I am very impressed with everyone. The doctor did a very thorough eye exam and was to the point in explaining everything. The lady who helped me in picking frames took her time with me, I didnt feel rushed at all. Everyone was professional with a side of humor which was very nice! As for frame options, there are alot. I will definatly go back next year!! Thank you Advanced Eye Care for having such nice employees 😊< /Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service, all the staff super friendly and with a lot of patience, there were no appointments available until after 2 weeks, I put my appointment and they put me on a waiting list and after 2 days they called me because someone canceled, so I recommend them let them do this

(Original)
Excelente servicio , todo el staff súper amigable y con mucha paciencia, no había citas disponibles si no hasta después de 2 semanas, puse mi cita y me pusieron en una lista de espera y a los 2 días me llamaron porque alguien canceló , así que les recomiendo que hagan esto.< /Text>

<Text>I can't say enough how terrific Scott and Richard is! I needed to get a small 5x5 storage unit that day. They are very understanding and listened to my situation.
We all know how google maps work when searching for a place. Though, don't let high reviews fool you, always visit them to see the location and talk with the staff in person.  Be kind and personable and you'll find out how they care about their work. Happy employees make for a happier business.  Anyhow.....

Upon researching online and visiting different Self Storage websites.... I've noticed there is a lot of online deals to be had right on their websites.  I narrowed it down to 4 different Self Storages. They all have very competitive prices online.  Though, one is way cheaper but does not compare to how well the other 3 maintain their properties.

Of the 4, I was able to narrow it down to just 2 Self Storages.  They both had great customer service, clean facilities, excellent security features and knew their business well.  Very close in rental prices online too.

Richard was helping me. Scott the manager, was helping another customer and I couldn't help but listen on the side. Great and awesome people!

Richard was able to answer all my questions and then some.  Security is top notch here.
- Gated with keypad
- Individually alarmed units
- Vented outside air into their facility. I couldn't find a climate controlled Self Storage around due to my time constraint and wanted to stay in carlsbad by Palomar Airport.
- They do use a special kind of lock that is set inside of the roll up doors with star keys. No hinges on their doors for padlocks. Another added security feature.  I don't mind.... I'll use StorQuest again in a heartbeat.
- Customer restroom. Well taken care of
- Surveillance system
- Free carts to use to move your goods
- Large Elevators
- Main building has a covered loading dock
- Well maintained
- Clean. Inside and out. Just a beautiful location
- Boxes and accessories if you need to buy.
- Go ask them about different leasing times.
- They do have different tiers on access times.  No 24 hour access.

- Though you have to buy storage rental insurance from them or provide your own.  An added cost, but I didn't mind for the price I was given.

Do check them out if you are looking! Check out their website first for availability and call if you have any questions about StorQuest. I feel very safe here and for my stuff.

I've added photos and a few videos of this place

P.S. All their doors are in the process of a color change.  Don't be alarmed if their outside doors are red and inside is blue. They are in the process changing it all to red.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4AsSajVH_4UTJEHGVaPdMxqD4Vi0MwrvkvFGW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtGFqwQGPj7QU_yDzgIRG6ErtJSdJVzESIeGpY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlYis0177Cuty9vqGWGU8UX0aFSAhvsHvD4ol7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqJ-GHMqgIWYcVF6n8XyWKkMebOekqeZ19Ktcj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOawMCLLKoXqVddqUjfCwd_sOoi7M2CL5-vU121=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlJJmSYD_YyQNKrCrpBXqEw0kJQbO6QFLyOQg3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH1MzNjIFYO5O0SXQWlJZC747idfa6laBvOrY7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa5VrPTVtbqdZhK8AOI1Jf52_2PZM5cRmZrhML=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXlP-ROnpC3o8i3irIh0CIt8NOnC8z2bvFZOJu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxZjQ4RS5nKTM_Pn5qO9VmJ8_gVrbh3bpPB1zT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkT6nA_ubOFEKpfvT99-V6biydRUL2ljvOn7Qc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhso1_EhUi3rAnoG9SmKDV983l0QQv3I8_V472=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNanElC1GYfXC-2JSTCZHsL1nJzPUPDWrVG8_qS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZtCYVTfSWUyjoSbVDA4Wp6kW_mDnVzPAtnO81=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_3tgbf1gGtYYgwmrkVSn3bwsyg3jEwX8rl_6B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMS22rPYLNxSCy4asHm_HE2T_5c3G8pj0n5uJAX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLMdhNaJ7l95isRf2cjsOeO5jQnDm9TN9gYjwK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl1BZkkbfyoON8RRwatliwh3539wzXyFqCpia5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMm2W41kOlPw9veo3QCuzFMpUHqdM3ZctJpmTNw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1P0kDmpsN4f2dk1EoC4p1zNo1p6JIY7aF8KQn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKR2GfX1-DevCqu2AGYGeGDrCRul9uhnSWJMNe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi0-LgROytj2unTIXWd_QSGBvGtLDrjS2lbgY9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIdn3t9TPIoXJCnut_itJusFN2U57Mm4I24E-P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6zNw4Ct2IWofhQRuRQvEyL8yuhOnS_uuDV0YF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

My experience with StorQuest Carlsbad was exactly what I had hoped for. I had no problem accessing my unit as much as I needed, and the managers at this facility were always extremely professional and helpful. Scott worked with me to identify a good location for my storage container for both moving in and moving out. There were no hidden fees, as Scott was very transparent about the costs upfront. I would absolutely store here again in the future.< /text>

<review>Scott Jedlick had handled our account from the beginning. His expertise, professionalalism, knowledge and friendly manner really makes a difference and is the deciding factor for our decision to use this StorQuest location. He is also the 'why' behind our 5 star rating.
This is now our 3rd year with StorQuest and we can honestly say it is because of Scott that we remain loyal.
With regards to the facility, it is modern, clean, bright, safe and convenient.<//review>< Pictures>

StorQuest Carlsbad was perfect for what we needed. The place is clean, safe, and well-lit and easily accessible off El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road. Scott was helpful and very informative. I wish we would have made the decision to use StorQuest earlier.</Text>

This storage facility and location is excellent. The manager, Scott Jedlick, is very personable and responsive, made our whole expericence renting two storage spaces easy. He really took care of us, and a nice guy! Had the lockers for over two years. The facility is clean, accessible, plenty of carts to move items from your car to your space. The storage facility is in a very nice business park in Carlsbad, very close to where I use to work.  Never had a bad experience with either the facility, management or other clients. Very reasonably priced as well given the location and shortage of spaces in the market.

When we did not need the lockers anymore due to a work relocation, Scott was excellent and took care of us. Five stars to the facility and the management, highly recommend StorQuest of Carlsbad!</review>

We’ve had a storage unit for about a year and never had any issues! The facility is clean and well lite, super secure and well maintained. We upgraded out unite to a 10x15 and their price is competitive with the neighboring businesses.
Scott the manager is amazing and helpful whenever we needed something!
Highly recommend this place<//text>

Scott was professional, pleasant and incredibly helpful.  Very easy process.  Very clean location.  Competitive, if not the, best prices in the area.  I was at another storage company's location, which was filled with dust, debris and bugs. This place is CLEAN.  If you want your things safe and clean, this is a better choice.</text>

I was looking for an easy and affordable storage facility near my home. Not only was this the closest, but lowest cost. Scott the manager was helpful and efficient at getting me a unit and explaining how everything is managed. The facility is clean, safe, secure. Now I can get both my cars in the garage!< /text>

Richard was very helpful. He was very friendly and easy to talk to. I was in a hurry, so I told  Richard that I did t have time to look at the storage unit. He informed me that by law, he had to show me the storage unit before I sign on the dotted line. I was a little irritated, but due to the fact I needed a storage unit that day, I of course agreed. He told me that he would be quick and get me out of there as fast as he could, which I appreciated. Thank goodness Richard insisted on showing me the unit because I was shocked by how small it was. I appreciate the fact that  Richard didn’t cut corners, and actually did his job. And I also appreciate his promptness, because he did what he promised me; he got me out of there super fast. Richard ended up showing me a bigger unit and even though it cost my first born (aka super expensive) I decided to take it. The unit was more expensive than a number of other units I found. However, I felt a little better about paying more because for starters, all the security measure in place ensure that all the things I am storing in storage unit will be safe (knock on wood). Secondly, even though my storage unit was inside, on the second floor, I don’t mind paying more for accessibility. I was able to back my U-Hail a few feet away from the elevators and there are large  dollies/carts available if you need it. And I definitely needed to use them and it made things so much easier and allowed me to get everything stored and put away so much faster!! And lastly, I don’t mind paying more for great  service. Richard was so helpful and I appreciate him dotting every I and crossing every T to ensure that I was completely taken care of. Oh and by the way, Richard deserves a raise and a promotion.

Thank you!!</Review>

<review>I just got a storage unit here today! Big thank you to Scott Jedlick, the manager at the Carlsbad location, who made the whole process of getting a storage unit super quick and easy. He had an answer for every question I had and was such a nice guy. As for the storage facility itself, the place is conveniently located in Bressi Ranch, right off of Palomar Airport Road. Everything is nice and new and the place is kept really tidy. The loading bay is covered and hand carts are available for easy loading and unloading. Super happy I picked this place to store all my extra stuff!</review>< GmapID>

<Text>Scott Jedlick and Jessica, forgot her last name,  were very experienced in helping me decide which size storage to reserve for my house move out for our remodel.  Scott explained everything to me in an easy to understand manner, showed me the space and pointed out the features of the facility.  Jessica was also very knowledgeable about the facility and help me access my space the first time.  The security features of the facility were also explained and really sealed the deal.  I feel very confident our possessions will be safe and secure while we remodel our home.  I look forward to storing our things at StorQuest over the next year.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Awesome customer service, Scott is very accommodating and has let us change units several times (we needed more storage).  Location is very safe, everything is securely gated, easy to drive up and get to.  We are very happy and will continue to use for our storage needs. Thank you! 5 stars!!!< /Text>

I want to give a shout out to Scott Jedlick. He is a big part of why I love StorQuest. I got great service. He was professional and knowledgeable and true to his word. He was quick to take care of any issues re my storage unit and very helpful in setting me up with just the right amount of space for the things I had to store. I am a very happy StorQuest customer!<//review>

I’ve been storing here for over 10 years! All different size units and circumstances. Scott is always willing and happy to help find the right fit for me and my family! I wouldn’t store anywhere else. And I always feel safe at my unit as well, which means a lot! Thank you!!<//Review>

Hands down the best customer experience I think I’ve ever had... for real, no hyperbole. Super efficient, respectful of people’s time, and staff that listens and responds with actual solutions.

Scott (seriously the nicest dude ever) saw that I was on a time crunch. He and his co-worker went above and beyond to get me exactly what I needed and set everything up within minutes. True professionals</review>

I called more than 10 storage unit businesses to get pricing and unit information for a medium-sized unit.  With long-term or military discounts, StorQuest was by far the cheapest, saving me more than $300 in a year.  And so far from what I have experienced, the quality of service and professionalism is not diminished by the cheaper price.  Scott, the manager, and his associate Richard were amazing in helping us get settled into out unit.  Absolutely recommend.</Text>

<Text>The StorQuest at Bressi Ranch has the most convenient location, close to both residential and commercial areas of Carlsbad. It is somewhat tucked away and has the feel of a secured place. It is clean and has plenty of loading carts available. I have been using it for a few years now and have always received great service. The store manager, Scott and his staff are friendly, communicative and helpful. Thank you!< /Text>< Rate>

Scott is one of the most chill and professional people I've had the pleasure of doing business with. He was efficient in every way -- fast, thorough, and made the experience easy and enjoyable. Without a doubt a breath of fresh air. The facility is clean, safe, and well-kept, and the prices are amazing. I cannot commend Scott enough for his work and I would highly recommend this place to anyone.</review>< rating>

Storquest has been a great company to store with. The site is always spotless, well maintained and safe. The best thing about the Carlsbad location is the staff.  Scott is an amazingly kind and thoughtful leader, and his customer service and expectations for the team he leads ensures that customers have a positive experience. I have been a customer for years and could have moved somewhere cheaper, but the people there make it worth the extra money.<//Text>

As someone looking to quickly source a space I was very much at the will of all the storage businesses in the Oceanside/Carlsbad area. And if you're currently doing research you know that the quality of storage businesses in the area aren't the best, both in management and pricing. I went to 4 different places between Oceanside and Carlsbad where I came across either rude/unhelpful management of exorbitant prices. Truly it felt I was going from one dirty used car salesman to another.

However, when I got to StorQuest in Carlsbad I was blown away by the employees and prices. I was helped in a way that made me feel as if it didn't matter if I was going to buy a storage unit or not, they were just trying to help solve one of my problems. Not only did they help source me a storage unit that was $30-$70 cheaper then any of the neighboring storage businesses but they also accommodated me closer to closing hours.

I would highly recommend this business and this specific location.</review>

I am a return customer, due to Scott's excellent,, professional service..
I just closed on my home and needed storage.  I remembered my past
experience at Storquest as very good.   Came in and signed up with Scott and it was like seeing and old friend.  He recommended  the perfect unit, I wasn't sure what I needed this time.  I am very thankful that Scott was at Storquest.  Best Company for storage,, clean spacious and easy access.<//Review>

I stored my household items here for over a year. From start to finish... the service was great. I worked directly with Scott, the facility manager, from the beginning of moving everything in until vacating the unit. He was THE BEST. He went out of his way to help me find the best possible solution and explained everything thoroughly. And ... he treated me like a valued customer as much when I was arranging to vacate the unit as he did when I was arranging to rent it! I will definitely be back if I need to store anything again and highly recommend Scott at StorQuest if you have any storage needs!<//Review>

<Review>My schedule is very busy. I showed up at the StorQuest in the middle of the Manager's lunch. The closed sign was up but I didn't see it, and went in with the  UPS man.
The Manager put his lunch to the side, and went through the whole process  of helping me rent a storage unit.
I am very impressed with their level of security.
I have rented many storage units, this was by far the easiest process.
As I was leaving, two more people came in to rent a unit.
Even with being a very busy center, they gave great customer service.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Scott, the store manager was very helpful.  I just moved to the area and he assisted in making sure I got the right size unit and walked me through the property, which is very clean as well as the office.  I would highly recommend this place.

The facility has been so convenient and easy that I came back for another unit.  Office personnel very friendly and helpful.<//review>

I am doing some research on storage units in a couple of areas and Scott delightfully answers the phone and was very helpful, reassuring and spoke to many needs that I didn’t even realize I had. He spoke to many concerns that I had not considered and I really got that he knows people, our needs and what’s important to us as customers. Thank you for the time you spent explaining everything so thoroughly.<//Review>

I’ve been a long standing customer here and it’s because of Scott and the others that work there. They are very clean units and a safe environment along with extremely helpful staff in so many ways. I’d Highly Recommended this storage place to everyone and have referred many people to bring there things here with complete peace of mind.
Great People!  Great place! Try it, you’ll be pleased.

Great experience in every aspect.  Scott and Richard are both amazing and really made a difference in the company.  As packages were delivered they both knew me by name, called if there were any problems, and were very helpful in management of my storage unit.  StorQuest itself was a great facility, but I can honestly say that the way it's managed is the biggest difference.< /text>

We've been renting a storage unit at StorQuest Carlsbad for the past 3 years.  We just got our second unit yesterday to expand upon our storage needs.  Scott and Richard are tremendously helpful.  Getting the second unit set up was quick and easy.  The customer service that they provide is top notch.  Thank you Scott and Richard!</Text>

We just rented a storage space today from Scott Jedlick. He was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain their different options and how we would access our unit.  This place was recommended to us and would recommend it to any one looking for a clean, safe and reasonably priced storage unit.<//Text>

Easily the best storage facility in North County. Premises is always clean and accessible. There are always plenty of carts for moving my items to and from storage. The staff member, Scott, is incredibly friendly and personable. He takes time to get to know me. That personal touch adds just that extra level of pleasant experience.

Facility is extremely secure, with several layers of access code. It’s the safest storage unit I’ve ever had. This is my second time at StorQuest Storage and I will never use another. I’d recommend anyone who needs short or long term storage to go with StorQuest here in Carlsbad.<//Text>

<text>I signed an online lease with StorQuest which made the process quite simple, however they left lots of questions and didn’t have me fully prepared to start using the unit. Upon arriving to StorQuest I was greeted by the manager Scott and his assistant Robbie. Scott informed me he was on break but Robbie could assist me. However, Scott ended up taking the entire time to answer any questions and make sure I was comfortable with all of storequest policies. This type of customer service is not found in the storage industry, and I am very thankful for Scott and Robbie’s assistance.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Very positive.  Scott Jedlick was very helpful, from helping me find the right unit, to accompanying me to my unit and showing me exactly how the lock works, and how to get into and out of the storage complex with my designated code.  I am very pleased with the quality of the unit and how clean the premises and my unit are.</Text>

I got a reasonable deal on line and expected a haste on location. Richard was professional and helpful and supported everything we were told online.  So far all is great.  Only surprise is our lock from extra space does not work at storquest.  Expect to pay an added $21 for their lock.
When vacating unit i was told over phone cost would be prorated and I would be rebated for unused time i already paid for. They did not do that in reality.</text>

Hello,

I really didn't expect to receive the customer service I did. Scott Jedlick was amazing. He was so knowledgeable and took such good care of me.

<text>We were very pleased with StorQuest and have always received great service from the manager Scott Jedlick. We rented a unit for over 7 years and found the facilities to be consistently clean, easily accessible, very secure and a good value. Scott was always helpful and friendly whether we needed a cart or had a question. We highly recommend the Carlsbad StorQuest.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The prepay option is great for those of us that plan on storing items for a set period of time. They also had the best advertised price of any storage company in Carlsbad!

But......  what really sets you apart from the competition is Scott.  You are very fortunate to have him as the manager.  He is absolutely amazing.   Richard is excellent, as well.  Always very friendly and helpful. As a former business owner, I understand how difficult it can be to find good people who care about the business as much as you do.  Scott has that true sense of ownership and pride in what he does , and that is such a rare quality in this day and age.  Make sure you take good care of him!!  :)<//text>< Resp>

The storage itself is kept incredibly clean and always has carts and other necessities for moving things to and from my unit. This is the only place I feel secure in storing my personal belongings.

10/10, would store again.< /review><gmapID>0x80dc749f9a31de93:0x567614eb22982eb9<//gmapID><response>{'time': 1548610167357, 'text': 'You just made our day, Scott!

Scott has been amazing and put up with me the last few years! He has gone above and beyond and making sure that my storage experience was effortless and hassle free!  Scotts ability to genuinely care and accommodate my needs made everything so much easier! Even this last week when I had to cancel my storage unit because I ended up having a change of plans,  Scott went above and beyond once again and making sure that everything I needed was taken care of… Not to mention even offering to take my lock off my storage unit so I wouldn’t have to walk!!!!! I will definitely be coming back if I ever need storage unit again! Thank you again Scott for everything!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Clean, super nice management, high tech, but what really put it over the edge was the security. I am super pleased with their cylinder lock system.

UPDATE 1.5 yrs later: Sounds weird but it’s been a pleasure having our belongings here. We’ve stored everything we own here for a year and a half, while we were staying with family. My husband comes to visit our stuff and add more weekly. It’s extremely convenient and clean. We’re now moving out into our own place again but Richard and Scott are wonderful.

Your manager, Scott Jedlick, at the 2500 Campbell Place, Carlsbad, was delightful to work with renting a large self storage space. He called me soon as a space opened and gave me a great deal. Your facilities are excellent, best I was able to find, roomy, easy access, and very secure. I would recommend  to anyone.</Review>

Scott and his team were amazing to work with! The customer service here was next level and the unit we rented was perfect for our needs. The site is very clean and I always felt safe. Scott went above and beyond to make sure we were well cared for. If you need a storage unit, you should absolutely check out the Carlsbad StorQuest.< /review>

<text>Scott, Richard, and the rest of the StorQuest Carlsbad staff provided excellent service throughout my 6-month lease with them.  They were engaging and always helpful, which gave me great peace of mind that my unit was safe and secure.  The facility itself was always clean and tidy.

This place is great!  I've rented from a couple of different storage companies in the past couple years but this one is top notch.  The facility is clean, well-maintained, safe and in a great location.  Scott (manager) was very helpful.  He clearly laid out the options and worked with us to find the one that best fit our needs, and has continued to provide great customer service throughout our stay here.  Thanks for everything Scott!</review>

Scott was more than helpful, he went above and beyond to find the perfect storage unit to fit my needs.

<Review>The entire staff was always friendly, and helpful. The facility is always clean, secure, and worth every dollar spent.  I have used other nationwide storage facilities before, and StorQuest has been the overall best that I've used over the years! Highly recommended since 2016!

I need a storage unit unexpectedly at the minute and I went back to Storquest to see if they could accommodate me.  Thankfully they did, and was glad to see that Scott was still there and continued to provide 5 star customer service with a smile. I must also to give Kudos to Sam who helped me in every way possible in getting my account set up, as I had forgotten my reading glasses and was in a rush against the clock. Thanks again to Scott and Sam, you guys rock!< /Review>< gmapID>

Rented here for 5 years. I tell everyone how clean it is and the Manager Scott is great!

I am adding that it’s been six years now with StorQuest and, as in the above comment, I would not move from there if I lived in Los Angeles!  Scott is meticulous in keeping the place clean and he is positive and thorough in the business end.  Both Scott and Richard are terrific.  If Scott moved to another store I would go with him. I have brought in a few customers since I have been at StorQuest and they feel the same.  Thank you.<//text>

Scott made the decision to use StorQuest an easy one. He explained the process, cost, options in detail and was patient with us as we made our decision. After looking at other area options I highly recommend StorQuest. The facility is clean, access is easy and it's secure. The service that Scott  and his team provide puts it over the top.</Text>

I have been using the Carlsbad StorQuest location for a couple years. It has served my needs wonderfully as a temporary location for some belongings while I relocated. When I visited my storage unit, I was often greeted by the friendly staff. Scott stood out as an incredibly hard worker and was always able to help when I needed questions answered. He is truly an asset and one reason I didn't move out sooner. Thank you StorQuest and mostly thank you Scott.<//Text>

This is the second time we have rented a storage unit at this facility. We were happy 10 years ago and happy again this year. It still is as clean and "new" as it was a decade ago. It still looks like it just opened!
Even more importantly is the outstanding treatment we received from the building manager, Scott. He was warm, friendly and engaging. He gave us his full attention to our storage needs. It is such a rarity to receive such great customer service in this industry. We were pleased to find the ideal space for our needs and also so pleased to work with this great professional. As a REALTOR in the community, I will be recommending StorQuest to those who need this service.<//Text>

Super helpful and professional. The facilities are the best you’ll find anywhere. Not sure how cost compares to a lot of other places but absolutely worth it. Convenient entry and elevator in the back gets us really close to where we need to get to for the unit.<//Review>

Rented here for 5 years. I tell everyone how clean it is and the Manager Scott is great!

I am adding that it’s been six years now with StorQuest and, as in the above comment, I would not move from there if I lived in Los Angeles!  Scott is meticulous in keeping the place clean and he is positive and thorough in the business end.  Both Scott and Richard are terrific.  If Scott moved to another store I would go with him. I have brought in a few customers since I have been at StorQuest and they feel the same.  Thank you.</Review>

<Review>This facility is the best storage place I have ever used. It is very clean and very secure. The staff is courteous and very professional. We have dealt with Scott Jedlick (manager) several times (first time was totally remote from NorCal) and he always goes the extra distance to make you feel comfortable and remove any worries. We will always use this facility for our storage needs</Review></record>

Richard at StorQuest Storage/ Bressi Ranch was great today! He went over our lease option in detail, took us to see our storage unit and was very professional, patient, and detailed in explaining the process of entering the facility and utilizing the elevator and exiting. Our customer experience with Richard was excellent! His Manager Scott evening took time to say hi to us while we were in the office area. I would definitely recommend anyone and everyone to bring your business here. The facility is clean and well maintained and secure.

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>We are just beginning our storage experience here. If the days ahead are anything like this initial experience, I am confident this review will never need amending.
The manager Scott was very thorough and patient. He explained everything completely and clearly. That is surprisingly unusual in this business. He gave us good advice and made no attempt to upsell or parade me through an endless array of packing and moving supplies. He also explained the contract and potential ways we might save money.  All that and he is a great guy.
This has already been the best storage experience I've ever had.

Ok, we had our precious belongings here for a couple months and my original review in the paragraph above this stands. Everytime I have visited my stuff the entire place is spotless and secure. Scott and Richard provided excellent customer service on our exit, and frankly, they are also nice guys.

I'm too old to put up with BS. This storage facility is top-notch and gives you a "no muss no fuss"
experience.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Easy online booking service.  The manager, Scott Jedlick, was very helpful and informative - he took the time to show us several storage options and explained several pricing options for longer term storage.  The units are clean, neat, well lit.

This is an update to a review a year ago - I just emptied out our unit after about a year's use.  Once again, Scott took the time to explain all my options on timing for clearing out the unit and made the process simple.  He then called to follow up to see if I needed anything else and has gone to bat for me to get a refund for the extra month plus I had prepaid.  I cannot thank Scott enough for all his help and professionalism.  He is always a joy to speak with and most helpful.  StorQuest is very lucky to have him on staff.  Thanks Scott!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I was greeted very nicely today by a gentleman by the name of Ron. I immediately asked for Scott as he has been my go to person for years. Ron totally understood and just so happened Scott was returning from lunch and was able to help me. I have had units at this facility for years in Carlsbad and have always totally loved this facility. It is perhaps the cleanest facility I have used. I currently have one in Oceanside and that is why I'm here today. There is not anyone  available to help me in Oceanside with my concers and it definitely is not kept as well as this facility so I'm here for another unit!!
Thank you, thank you for employing such great employees (Scott and Ron) and having such a clean and beautiful facility!!<//text>

I have rented a storage unit at StorQuest for the last 5 years. Scott, the manager, as well as the staff are friendly, courteous, and always ready to help. StorQuest is extremely clean, well-maintained, and safe, as well as security-minded. I have been very happy with StorQuest and would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends. Definitely earns 5 stars!<//Text>

<Text>So, we finally caved and got a storage unit after YEARS of debating and procrastinating.  We looked at the various options around the area, and StorQuest was by far the best.  The cleanest, most accessible, safest, and best customer service.  Scott was our rep and he was fantastic.  He showed us our options and helped us decide which of the available units were the best for our particular needs.   We feel really good about our decision!< /Text>< UserId.>

<UserId.>114171266104879933745< /UserId.><text>Easy online booking service.  The manager, Scott Jedlick, was very helpful and informative - he took the time to show us several storage options and explained several pricing options for longer term storage.  The units are clean, neat, well lit.

This is an update to a review a year ago - I just emptied out our unit after about a year's use.  Once again, Scott took the time to explain all my options on timing for clearing out the unit and made the process simple.  He then called to follow up to see if I needed anything else and has gone to bat for me to get a refund for the extra month plus I had prepaid.  I cannot thank Scott enough for all his help and professionalism.  He is always a joy to speak with and most helpful.  StorQuest is very lucky to have him on staff.  Thanks Scott!< /text><user_name>Jean Camp</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I highly recommend this storage facility! Scott and Vince provide excellent customer service & communication. The facility is impeccably clean, the location is great and the hours work really well for my lifestyle. Pricing is competitive for other storage places in the area,  but I do feel I was given a good promo when I moved in. It's great to feel safe & secure while most of my belongings are being stored away from me. I love that they have motion activated lights in the building so that energy is conserved when not in use. I also prefer to frequent businesses who support our local troops and veterans and these guys really do what they can. (I'm from a military family but not in the service myself). Although I definitely don't want to store "my life" forever, I'm really happy with this place and will stay there as long as need be and recommend them to anyone who needs storage in North County.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>I am a retired Cop who was looking for a safe place to store my stuff. I want security, security  and morr security! When I arrived at StorQuest Carlsbad Scott and his coworker went out of their way to help me and address my questions about security. As it turns out this facility is built like Ft. Knox with many levels of security in place. A couple  of examples....the units are alarmed individually and only people renting on a floor can access that floor. I rented a unit. The application process was easy. I would highly recommend this place to keep your possessions safe.<//text>< Pictures>

First off, this place is CLEAN! Other places just don’t come close to the attractiveness and cleanliness of this place. And second, and high up on the list: both the manager, Scott Jedlick and his assistant, Richard offer great customer service. Prior to getting this storage unit, I checked out several places (over the phone and in person). During this period (person and phone), I talked to both Scott and Richard and they explained things well and came across as very professional, plus the rate I was quoted was extremely competitive. I got a 10’ X 15’ unit with StorQuest that was less expensive that some other places’ 10’ X 10’ units.

I was a little hesitant about a second story unit, but Richard pointed out the dollies around the facility and with being able to park right next to the elevator (and with my unit being close to the elevator), I found that my initial fears were unwarranted. It was easy to access my unit, and to move things in and out of it.

At this place, they have you purchase a cylinder lock (~ $20.00 plus tax) to lock your unit. This is a very secure type of lock! In the past, at another storage facility, I had my lock cut open and my unit broken into. When I told this to StorQuest manager, Scott, he explained how secure and virtually-tamper proof these cylinder locks are.

There was one more thing that I really liked about this place: after punching in your code at the entrance, the buildings are arranged so that you drive (in one direction) in a big square and exit at the other side (where you again punch in your code for the exit gate to open). This seemed safer to me than cars and trucks coming and going in different directions, and like I said before, I was able to park right next to the elevator in my building. The driving space/path between the buildings was quite adequate so that cars and trucks could easily pass around cars parked to the side.

I had my unit at StorQuest for about 6 months until I could arrange to move my items out, and Scott was extremely helpful on my last day there (extending my gate access hours by two hours to accommodate my needs). If I ever need a storage unit again, and am in this North County area, I’d definitely use StorQuest - Carlsbad / Campbell again!</review>< Pictures>

Today we called in, needing some assistance, and Ron stepped right up to do everything he could to make sure we had what we needed. He was particularly sensitive to our family crisis. To be honest, this 5 star level of customer service seems to be just standard operating procedure at this location. Over the years Scott, Vince, others, and now Ron have always been so willing to go that extra distance. This team has a remarkable dedication to customers, and we are so appreciative.

< review>
I highly recommend this storage facility! Scott and Vince provide excellent customer service & communication. The facility is impeccably clean, the location is great and the hours work really well for my lifestyle. Pricing is competitive for other storage places in the area,  but I do feel I was given a good promo when I moved in. It's great to feel safe & secure while most of my belongings are being stored away from me. I love that they have motion activated lights in the building so that energy is conserved when not in use. I also prefer to frequent businesses who support our local troops and veterans and these guys really do what they can. (I'm from a military family but not in the service myself). Although I definitely don't want to store "my life" forever, I'm really happy with this place and will stay there as long as need be and recommend them to anyone who needs storage in North County.</review>

I love having a storage unit here, when I showed up Scott was extremely helpful, and funny. I like doing business with upbeat people. He showed me around the facility and it was super clean and very fancy. I know my stuff will be safe here the security is so high tech it's comforting. Thanks StorQuest!</Review>

I have rented 2 units at the Carlsbad/Bressi Ranch location.  Both Scott and Richard have been friendly and efficient, and have gone out of their way to be accommodating.  In the service world their professionalism and willingness to help are seldom encountered any longer, but certainly most welcomed.  If a trip to DMV is at one end of the service scale, Scott and Richard are at the opposite end!</Review>

I needed temporary space for inventory from a business closure. Transition from corporate to the local site was seamless, the site itself is clean and easy to use, and the paperwork was handled swiftly.  Perfect execution from top to bottom with friendly service from Scott. Recommended.< /Text>

<Review>I recently was looking for a storage unit in the area. After reading some bad reviews of other places I stumbled across StorQuest. The reviews seemed legit so I decided to give it a look.

This was the first time I have ever rented a storage unit and most people don't get excited about storage units so I was skeptical.

I walked in and was greeted by Scott. First impression was fantastic. He was friendly and helpful. He walked me to through the whole process. Then he walked me to the unit I was about to rent. The hallways were clean, storage unit was in great shape, the indoor units are air conditioned, and they have security codes to protect your unit.

The following day I moved my stuff in. I pulled up to the gate and he came outside and greeted me with a smile. The move in went seem less (even though I was on the second floor). Moved right in and left without any issues.

VERY happy with StorQuest. If you are looking for a storage unit in the area I would highly recommend giving them a look. Chances are you will also be impressed.

Thanks Scott!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Staff is extremely professional and friendly. I have used other storage company and have never felt so that my unit would be as safe as I do here. They treat you like a valued customer who's business they wish to both win and keep. I cannot recommended it enough if you're looking for a storage unit in North County, stop looking and book here.<//text>

<text>I recently signed a year long lease on a storage unit with StorQuest.  Ron was the manager I worked with and he was fantastic.  He was knowledgeable, kind and professional.  I had several concerns about storage facilities in general, as I had surveyed many of them in the area.  Most facilities allow transients to make storage units their residence.  When touring such facilities, I personally witnessed transients smoking crack and letting their pit bulls run loose on the premises.  But, Ron made clear that they didn't allow such conduct on their premises.  He explained the top notch security of this facility and that they don't allow riff raff to inhabit the premises, which was of particular importance to me since I'm storing highly confidential documents.  No joke, I surveyed probably 20 facilities in the Carlsbad/Oceanside area and this is by far and away the best one.  Thanks, Ron!</text>< pictures>

I have been a customer of Storquest in Carlsbad for 4+ years!  The staff is great, the storage center is safe and clean and the service is exceptional.  They have always treated me like my business matters to them.

I would recommend them to everyone!< /review>

<Text>Polite, helpful, respectful, informative, and especially not pushy from the moment I called until my rental agreement was signed. A HUGE contrast with other storage businesses in the area. They offered to reserve the unit I needed without a credit card for up to a week. I was so pleased with everything that I went over that very evening (the Friday before Christmas) and finished the deal.</Text>< GmapID>

When it comes to storage, there aren't a lot of requirements (for me at least):
- accessible for long hours (early or late)
- clean
- secure
- not shady

StorQuest exceeded my expectations in all these areas. I was making runs late in the evening, which was helpful for my situation. Reasonably priced, close to home, very secure. They even have flatbed carts for use - which was super helpful. If I need storage in Carlsbad again, I'll go back here no question.<//Text>

What a great place to rent a storage unit. Such a great location that is easy to get to. The facility is clean and tidy, and the unit we were shown( and rented) was spotless clean. The service is fantastic! Scott is super informative and really explains all of the processes very thoroughly. Thank you Scott for making the renting very easy, quick, and convenient!!!! Give him some more awards! He’s only got 3 different awards on his desk! His guy needs a freakin trophy room over here!!!! Hahahaha.< /text>

They are the best.

Temperature control very good (best I've seen); very clean; very well lighted; good fire protection system and policies, a modern, multi-level security system, close access to all units; and the friendly staff is helpful and efficient with whatever you need (specialty boxes, bigger unit(s), etc.).  I looked at half a dozen local places -- they all looked fairly good -- before choosing StorQuest -- it looked better -- and will definitely use them again if the need arises.  And best of all: You can look up (if you're outside) and maybe see a P-51 Mustang or a B-17, (but usually a corporate jet) less than 500 feet above you (it's just south of the normal Palomar Airport landing path, kitty-corner to the end of the runway)!  (Admittedly, if your boxes of old books and grandma's heirloom furniture is truly priceless to you, then for perfect security I suppose being nearly right under the approach to the busiest single-runway airport in the country is not a feature.  But if it means that much to you, you really need a different level of security/storage anyway! :-))</Review>

Storquest in Carlsbad is newer and very clean, which are a couple of the reasons I like it.  The staff, Scott and Vince are super friendly and helpful.  The hours are convenient and there are plenty of carts available to use.  It's very organized and getting in and out is a breeze.  If you're looking for a great place to store your stuff, this is it.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>We rented 3 units from them recently and opened them with 3 different employees there, and found them all to be extremely helpful, knowledgeable, personable, friendly and professional. Scott, Isaiah and Vince are great!

We had never rented a storage unit before, so wasn't sure what to expect, but this place exceeded all of our expectations. Even with 3 units, we never had a single issue arise where we couldn't get in, find a cart, or feel insecure.

Safety and security were a prime concern of ours, and though no place can be 100% secure, we found this StorQuest to be in a good, safe area. The units are accessible only to patrons.

Cost-wise, it's very reasonable, and the guys will work with you to give you the best rate they can.

We highly recommend this facility.< /text>< pics>

Scott J was very helpful and very professional.  We liked that the entire location was clean.  Scott provided us with a lot of details and information of what StorQuest provides.  We like that there are hand carts available on-site and the ease of finding the individual units -- clearly-marked signs to guide you in the long hallways.  We were especially impressed with the security of every storage unit and the overall location.  Scott was very friendly and informative (answered all our questions) in rental contractual requirements, payment methods, access times, fire protection, and Storquest's elaborate security system.  He listened to our needs and what we were looking for, storage-wise.  Thank you to Scott, for the wonderful tour!  We were so impressed with everything that we signed up almost immediately.

I've rented from StorQuest Carlsbad for 3 years, and it's been great. The units are very clean and secure, and the guys at the front are always helpful. When I needed recommendations for a mover and where to store my car, they helped me with that, and their recommendations were excellent as well.</Review>

Ron helped us find the perfect storage unit! He was very patient with us during the appointment following our online reservation. The place is well-secured (almost too secured) and tidy.  The contract process was easy and straight-forward.<//Text>

<review>Scott, Vince and Ron have customer service down!  I have been renting from the Carlsbad location for almost 5 years now.  I am also a lifetime storage renter!  This weekend I needed another unit for my elderly mother who is leaving her home after 50+ years!   It is a moving nightmare!  I rented one size then needed a larger size the day of the move.  Both Scott and Ron took over made the change as seamless as possible, and were happy to do it!  Wish everything was this easy!  Thank you all!<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This place is as secure as Fort Knox! Your pass-code won't even take you to a floor where you are not supposed to go.  Very clean and spacious units, with reasonable rents.  Vince will remember you when you come back after a month, is helpful and will try to understand/accommodate your needs.  Scott is mindful of the level of customer service offered.< /review>

This is by far the best storage facility I know of. The security is amazing, Ron was very friend and informative when signing us up, the location is perfect(super convenient by being close to everything, but not on a main road so there was minimal traffic to deal with), and the price was great for all of this in a very clean and well situated facility.<//review>

I know I am a stranger on the internet but if you are reading this and need a storage unit, stop and rent here. The facility is impeccably maintained, the security of the facility is top notch, and the staff is amazing. Scott is amazing, he personally saw to my needs and requests to ensure I was happy with my storage needs. I will tell you that I would not store my stuff anywhere but here. I am moving 40 miles away and if I ever needed a storage unit again I would make the drive, it’s THAT good. Honestly look at other storage places in the area and then look here, you will end up renting at Storquest it’s not even close.< /Review>

<review>Have a storage unit inside main building.  Told staff there was a problem with the lights around my unit not coming on. So I have to access things in the dark !!  Told them again - the response was that I need to walk around the corner to activate the sensors that turn on the lights.  Tried everything - nothing - reported it again !  AND again - Wake up !!! Are you deaf ?  Fix the damn light - I am fed up of having to use a flashlight.   Plain English does not work with the staff at this site.< /review>< Pics>

I have been renting a storage unit at the Carlsbad location for almost three years and if I could give the I I I    I have been renting a storage unit at the Carlsbad location for almost 3 years and if I could give the manager Scott and the assistant manager Vince 6 stars I would. Both of these gentlemen go above and beyond with exceptional customer service. The facility is always clean and bright including the restrooms. The lobby is cheerfull and nicely decorated. If you are looking for storage units and a friendly staff this is the  place to rent one.

I just finished up my second experience with this storage facility and will plan to use them again.  They are always very helpful at the front desk and the property manager Scott takes the time to get the right unit and unit location for you.  This is a very clean facility and clean units that never have that musty storage facility odor.  Overall, I would recommend them to anyone wanting to have a professional property storage experience!< /Review>

<review>Storequest is AMAZING! For over three years the staff and facility have been perfect. They gave me a great price and a large climate controlled unit with great light and a robust automated security system. I can't recommend them more!< /review>< pics>

For a public storage I was really impressed with the cleanliness, and for the staff; they were very respectful and professional, can't say enough good things about this location! Would give 6 out of 6 stars if I could!<//Text>

This place is clean and well kept and it was unfair of me to give Scott a mediocre rating.  He does a good job and will go out on a limb for his tenants.  What I didn't know about StorQuest is they do automatic rate increases, like everybody else, in certain months of the year.  To avoid this rate increase, the tenant can opt to pay upfront for a long term lease (6 mos.) to lock in their rate.  I don't believe other storage facilities offer this.  Based upon this new information, I have revised my rating to a Five Star.  This is a nice facility where you're stuff is safe and protected.
It's too bad there aren't more storage facilities to provide competition hereby keeping the rates low. Us Baby Boomers like to hold onto our old stuff in case we need to sell it to make ends meet.</text>

{'time': 1495732063353, 'text': 'Hi Geoffrey - Thanks for taking the time to provide your feedback. From time to time we must adjust rental rates to keep pace with the costs of maintaining a topnotch facility. We notify customers 30 days in advance to ensure they are aware of any changes taking place. However, we do offer long term discounts for customers who prepay six months to a year in advance, which locks in their rate for that period of time. We’d appreciate the opportunity to speak with you to gain a better understanding of your situation and encourage you to give us a call at your convenience 800-784-9176.'}< /response>

I just finished up my second experience with this storage facility and will plan to use them again.  They are always very helpful at the front desk and the property manager Scott takes the time to get the right unit and unit location for you.  This is a very clean facility and clean units that never have that musty storage facility odor.  Overall, I would recommend them to anyone wanting to have a professional property storage experience!< /Text>

I watched this facility get built from my nearby office in Carlsbad and soon became one of their first customers. I have always been impressed with their professional appearance, clean, pest free environment, well organized, brightly lit, very secure facility and ease of monthly payment. Scott Jedlick has always been there to help me with great customer service whenever I have needed assistance. There are other storage facilities closer to my home in Oceanside, but I am willing to make the drive to Carlsbad because Bressi Ranch Storquest is just THAT good.<//review>

< review>
I'm a longtime renter at Carlsbad Stor Quest (2009-2013) and am currently, almost 2 years.  Scott Jedlick has been genuinely supportive and gracious throughout this time, all the while maintaining a professional, effective office and making sure the premises are clean and functional.  Compared to other storage facilities I have experienced, Carlsbad Stor Quest is by far the best in every aspect....I attribute this to Scott's professionalism and work ethic.  Thank you Scott!</review>

What a refreshing surprise. I even called him prior to arriving to say we were going to be later than anticipated and he was so nice about everything. First off when you walk into the office, it is spotless, the bathroom is clean, holiday decor is up and Scott stands up and greets you, talk about amazing customer service. The storage unit we had was a little to small so he showed us another option and it was perfect. Being it was just after 5:30pm and he was about to leave around 6pm he advised that if we had any issues to call the emergency number. It was new place, first time seeing the premises and already I felt like he was a close friend. Though we may not be visiting our storage unit too much, I am so thankful to have met Scott and he just lightens anyones day, great customer service and goes above and beyond.<//text>< Pictures>

What a first class operation!   When I visited, I was greeted warmly and professionally by Property Manager Scott Jedlick.   He made my decision to rent here so easy!  He couldn't do more to ensure all my questions were answered and that I had all the information I needed to make an informed decision.  The property is beautiful and I couldn't be more confident that my belongings are safe and secure.  In all my subsequent dealings with Scott and his staff, I always receive first class service.  Every interaction is a personal experience.  They care.  I can't say enough good things about his facility and how well it is run.  Anyone looking for a place to store their belongings should most definitely go to StorQuest - particularly Bressi Ranch.  There are many storage options but StorQuest is by far the best value I have seen for such a high quality, top of the line facility and operation.  Many thanks to Scott and his team for taking such good care of us!  These folks are clearly #1!  Exceptional!< /review><username>Chris Palin< /username><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

<Time>1466962261308<//Time><text>Absolutely the best in North County and anywhere elses I've been for that matter... moving, storing, heck let's face it "life" is FULL of OMG this SUCKS moments... and in the middle of absolute frustration the staff at this place has been stellar. Vince and Scott have now on multiple occasions gone out of there way to make my life easier. The units are super clean...zero odor. All the access points including the large elevators are secured with a keypad which takes some getting used to, but the locks are super easy once you get the hang of it and you always leave the place with just no worries that your stuff will be well kept. You can't go wrong here... true problem solvers.<//text>< user_name>

<Review>Have been with StorQuest Bressi Ranch since it was Bressi Ranch Self Storage.  I have enjoyed the service I have received. Scott Jedlick offers a great service along with the rest of the staff.  Not the lowest price, but sometimes you get what you pay for.  Always clean, neat and have had no issues with pests or damage.</Review>< Date>

This is my third time I have rented from StorQuest. Once in Temecula with a 10 x 25 and more recently upsizing from a 10 x 13 to a 10 x 25 in Carlsbad.
The staff at both locations was very helpful and friendly at all times!
There are two things that would have made my experience with using them a lot more remarkable:
1) a trash dumpster. Bite the bullet you guys! People will take advantage of this and it will cost you some, but the amount of $ your company makes monthly, every month for very little work to keep customers coming back?
2) the monthly rent on the 10 x 25 in Temecula $241 and the same size in Carlsbad $370??? WHY and no returning customer break?
I will endeavor to get rid of all my storage possessions soon as I cannot justify this expense at 66 years old!

<Text>StorQuest Self Storange, is without a doubt, one of thee most professionally/friendly run businesses that I've had the pleasure in patronizing.

Believe it or not, I had attempted to rent a storage unit, at the U-Haul facility right down the road. They didn't have any units available in the size that I was seeking, so their manager referred me to, StorQuest. IMO, this speaks volumes; the fact that the competition would recommend a competitior.

Reason's why I highly recommend, StorQuest:

1, Their staff. Both Scott, & Vince are extremely professional, & were ALWAYS a pleasure interacting with. The front office is immaculate, efficient, & highly organized.

2. Best bang for the buck! This is a 5 Star facility. My storage unit, was actually cheaper than U-Haul, & much nicer!

3. Meticulously clean (even their bathrooms;).

4. Awesome location.

5. Safe!

FWIW: I can only assume, that the CEO of this business enterprise, must have a degree in, Business Management. With that said, it's the intangibles (things you can't teach), that make a business outshine it's competition. SQ, is in a class of their own!

The highest recommendation: 5 STARS!!!!!

Thank you!
Sincerely, John Lee Smith</Text>< Pics>

<time>1432743588451</time><Review>Very impressed with this facility. Driving up to it I thought " this is going to be pricey". I was pleasantly surprised after inquiring within that they are not only competitive with other major brand storage locations in the Carlsbad area but even cheaper when you compare apples to apples- oranges to oranges. The location is perfect for the tri-city area (central Carlsbad) next to two major thorough fares ( Palomar Airport Rd. and El Camino Real ). The facility itself is state of the art as far as storage facility technology (climate controlled, entry gate and unit access security ect...). Most important for me is that it is fully fire sprinklered for fire protection. In the past I suffered a major loss of heirloom items in a storage unit fire in Henderson, NV involving about ten units which did not have any fire protection systems. Insurance covered the loss but most items were not replaceable. Lastly, a big thanks to Scott Jedlick and his staff for outstanding customer service and running a tight ship!<//Review>< name>

<text>I've had a lot of experience moving around throughout my career, and as a result, to rent storage units a number of times in the last 25 years. This is by far the best. I have been so impressed with StorQuest at Bressi Ranch Self Storage, and the manner in which they conduct themselves, their business and treat their customers. I have been a StorQuest Bressi Ranch customer/tenant now for about 5 years, and I must say, it's been the best experience that I've ever had with any self-storage organization, anywhere!  The facility is always clean, well maintained and looks great. Scott Jedlick and Vince are just top notch; always helpful, friendly and efficient. They go out of their way to make you feel at home, comfortable, and work through whatever issues you might have, to make your experience absolutely the best. Their customer service is nothing short of exceptional.

In particular, Scott Jedlick, the property manager, has been amazingly helpful.  He has helped me identify my storage needs and he always takes the time to explain my options. His terrific customer service is always above and beyond, and exceeds my expectations ... I don't know that I have ever had such impressive customer service with any company. I am blessed to have found this facility, and feel so grateful and thankful to have Scott looking out for my best interests.  I highly recommend this facility to EVERYONE who has storage needs.

We will continue to use Bressi Ranch/StorQuest Self Storage for all of our storage needs.
