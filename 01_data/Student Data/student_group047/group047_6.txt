I come here when I really need to get the knots and tension released from my aching shoulders, back and neck. You won't find a better deal than here. 2 full hours for only $110! if you pay in cash. It's not as relaxing of an environment like a resort spa with the thin walls but it is still awesome. I prefer really strong hands and Sally has that kind of touch. She did a full hour on my shoulders and back then another hour for the rest of my body. I highly recommend it if your body is aching. You will definitely leave feeling better!< /review>

Had been looking for a good, deep tissue massage similar to the Thai massages I used to get in Japan. This was the closest I've found yet. Definitely recommend. I'd ordinarily give 5 stars had I never had the ones in Japan. Now I'm in pursuit for truly the best in San Diego.</text>

<date>1495310550422</date><rate>3<//rate><Text>For a foot massage place this was pretty average.  The receptionist tried to tell me they didn't have any "foot massage" people available, but if I wanted to jump up to the $40 price point they could help me right away.
When I said I would try back later, she said it would be just a minute and someone would be available.   The massage was alright, pretty light touch, where I like a deeper pressure.  The table was one of the most comfortable that I have been on.
For $20, it wasn't bad, but not amazing.</Text>< Pics>

I spend a lot  of time doing heavy lifting thanks to my landscaping business. I pass by this spa almost everyday, and decided to finally treat myself to a massage. I liked this place because it wasn’t ultra feminine, but still had a nice atmosphere and was tastefully decorated. I received a basic massage. I was expecting it to cost more than it did. The massage therapist seemed to be knowledgeable and managed to work out some major kinks in my back. I would come back again in a second!< /Review>

Best massages ever, whether you get a full body or foot.  And the foot massage includes head, neck, arms, back, which is awesome!  I come here at least once a month. The rooms are nice & quiet, away from street noise, and the music is soothing.  Those details make such a big difference.< /Review>

<review>This is one of the worst places I have ever been for a "massage." The person rubbed lotion all over my skin with very little pressure or and kind of massage. They spent most of the time focusing rubbing down my butt and thighs, and then propositioned me if I wanted "more" gesturing with her hand towards my groin. I was very upset that I paid any money for this massage. The massage therapist also did not want to let me out of the room without tipping and then said that most people give her 20. Do not waste your time here!< /review>< Pictures>

<Date>1509576403702< /Date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Massage was ok for price. Both therapists took way too long to retrieve towels. Reason for one star is they have recommended tip of 25%. If u tip below 25%, the therapists actually complain to u. Terrible business practice. Shocked people go back, but I guess since it is cheaper than high end places. They should simply raise prices and let customers tip what they want without complaints from therapists.< /Text>< Pics>

I have a bad back from working construction most of my life. I don't think I would be able to function on a day to day basis if it wasn't for my weekly massages. I have gone to every massage spot in Kearny Mesa/Clairemont area and Massage Oasis is by far my favorite place. They know my back better than I do.< /review>

<Review>This place can't be legal.  They don't speak English and what they call massage is like no massage I've ever had.  The girl I had just rubbed her elbow over the bones on my back and it was very painful.  Didn't seem to have the concept down that a massage is supposed to be performed on the muscles.  She didn't seem to understand even the word NO!  She stuck her fingertips in my ears deep enough to draw wax.  Then she started touching my eyelids and eye lashes with the same fingertips, EEWWW.  I almost left several times during the massage.  Up until this point the massage was totally dry, no lotion, no oil, just rubbing on my bones over and over making a poping noise/feeling that was very painful.  She took the top sheet off and rubbed oil all over my back and butt leaving me totally exposed for this part of the massage.  Their brochure said they can do Swedish Massage but this girl didn't even understand the word.  She never really massaged my other side other than more rubbng on my face.  Then all of a sudden she jumps up from her stool and says "over", then leaves the room.  When I left, at the front counter, they kept pointing to a sign that inicated they recommended a 25% tip for the therapist because they work so hard and the price they advertise is so low.  No way this business has a city massage establishment permit or that the therapists (sic) even have a city massage permit or any type of certification.  How could they?  They don't even speak English.  They probably just have a business tax permit and that's probably about it.  I'm going back to Massage Envy where at least they have real massage therapists, and that you can communicate with.  I can get a real 85 minute massage there for $57.<//Review>< Response>

I use to love this store. I like it however I don't love it anymore. If you don't know how much stuff cost they will over charge you. Also the lady will tell you one price however when you go pay the guy would charge you a different price. My daughter went to the store to get some stuff for me and they charged my bank card twice also they over charge her because I was in the store earlier and got the same thing and they charged her $10 more. Yes they did fix the issue so I didn't really think about it to much however my other daughter went in the yesterday to get two packs(4x) of hair that cost $8.99 and so edge control that cost $5.99 and they charged her $36 around $10 more smh. I had to call the store so they can fix This mistake too. This isn't the only time they have over charged my daughter's however it wasn't this much.< /text>

You find a great variety of hair here the best around, it's just the lady that owns the place is really mean so don't be surprised if you get into an argument with her shopping there< /Review>

I don't think you  regularly shop at beauty supplies and know the prices to say we're pricy. you should goto Sally's, ulta or sephora and see their prices some of their stuff is twice what it cost at our store. If you're buying your supplies from Walmart which is the only place I can think of that's cheaper, they buy in bulk 10,000 pieces at a time. we buy 12 or 24 at a time so we can't compete with huge chains. why are you being so destructive to small business. If we didn't pride ourselves in our low price I wouldn't even reply but you're making false statement and hurting our business without knowing the facts. you can either prove that we're pricer than other beauty supplies with another beauty supply receipt or please don't come back to the store. you're really hurting our business with false information. you are not welcome to the store."}<//Response><text>Customer service was very helpful.

Friendly staff & a pretty good selection of the usual Walgreens staples. Generally pretty clean inside and well stocked. Chilled drinks selection could be a bit more varied/healthy but that's about the only complaint. Convenient location too !</text>

< review>
This beauty supply is pretty much, a one stop shop for all your styling and beauty needs. I frequent this location because they carry a product that I live by and offer it in colors I have literally seen no place else. I travel 30 minutes or more because of the variety alone. The mom and pop type couple that operate the store are always so welcoming and helpful. I've never had a bad visit. Only issue I've faced as of yet was trying to decide upon what colors to put together!<//review>

We have the cheapest prices in Inland Empire, This is totally false statement, no one can beat our price because of the volume and the relationships we have with the wholesalers. We been in business for over 30 years. Please tell me which beauty supply is cheaper, its impossible.  Please don't make false claims.you can bring your receipt from that beauty supply and prove to us that you got your products cheaper. there's no way any of the beauty supplies around us is cheaper. 3 to 8 dollars that doesn't even make sense. you cant do the math. clearly you never had retail experience. Sorry to anyone that reads this if this comes off rude, but we run an honest family business for 30 years and we don't over charge our partrons in fact we have less of a profit margin than all the beauty supply stores in Inland Empire. its not like our prices are the same with other store we're so much cheaper.\n\nIf you think its cheaper somewhere else please go there, I guarantee you're paying more there."}</Resp>

A big selection of everything, but I couldn't look around to decide what I wanted, I had to be told what everyone else likes instead of me making my own decisions, then the Chinese lady manager tells me to leave just because I went outside to the car and came back.  "Come back another time."  Don't worry.  I won't.  Insulted, controlled, manipulated, and kicked out.  I didn't need to waste my gas for this s***.< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>My daughter and I came into this store, looking to get hair extensions. The first thing we noticed was that there were no employees to assist us so we just started to walk around unknowingly where to start. We do not know anything about hair extensions, and would’ve appreciated some assistance. When we noticed some extensions that we liked, we started to place our hair next the packaged hair to compare and match our hair colors, and that’s when a lady loudly demanded not to open any packages (which is something we weren’t doing or planning on doing). Another few minutes later, in front of her other customers, she loudly shouted, “Don’t mess it up! Get me next time! You’re messing it up!” After that, we simply left the store, shocked from the completely unwelcoming, impolite atmosphere. Instead, we went to Bobo’s Beauty Supply in Rancho Cucamonga. In there, we were immediately greeted and assisted by kind, welcoming employees. If you’re looking for excellent service, skip this place and go to Bobo’s!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I’ve been a regular at this store for a couple years because of their huge selection but the couple who own the store are incredibly nasty, rude, and (dare I say) racist, so I will be taking my business elsewhere. During my most recent visit, the lady followed me and my mother around the store eyeing us as if we were stealing, and she was rude and dismissive when we asked for help. The man at checkout was also very dry and rude. Unbelievable considering we shop here quite frequently and have been nothing but polite and decent. I understand that shoplifting is an issue but regardless, this is absolutely no way to treat paying customers. The store itself is dismal, uncomfortably stuffy and hot, and way overcrowded with products, many of which (hair products, certain makeup, lotions/shea butters) seem expired, dried out, and/or old. Yes the selection is good, but not worth the prices or the blatantly disrespectful treatment.<//text>< time>

This lady tells her man to follow the customers inside the store
She treats you like you've stolen from her before. Only been to this store a handful of times in all honesty i loved their wide selection of products and prices but the treatment received is enough for me to stop supporting this shop.<//Review>

They're rude and over price, it seems as though prices increase monthly... owners follow you on every aisle. This store is cluttered if you're not careful can trip or easily knock products over, and not everything is labeled with organization or priced for ease of shopping.</Text>

Goodus is open later than most other beauty supply. They have so many products in my opionion you have to kind of know what you want. If you don't the lady joy I believe is her name she will help you. And she will tell you the truth. If that color hair doesn't look good on you she will tell you. I also like that there is a salon in back where you can get the hair put in. I've never used it but that's a great idea. I got hair,, earrings, a pair of leggings , and edge control plus a bra and panties for under $60! The only reason I gave them a 3 is because of all their products they have.< /text>

This place has everything you’ll need a little pricey but have Everything. Now that’s out of the way these people are VERY RUDE. They treat you like your stealing if you spend more than 5 min there. My first experience there was with my 7 yr old son who even caught the scandalous vibe towards us I came a hr before closing looking for weaving hair in the aisle the husband and wife kept screaming we are about to close what do you want, I said idk I’m still looking the husband rushed to the aisle started rushing through the hair throwing it at my face we have this this pick something we about to close or jus I said I know that he throws his hand up and said well just leave come back tomorrow. My son said mom why are they treating us like that I was so hurt when I left the store I just sat in the car for 5 min just to gather myself. VERY RACIST AND PUSHY PEOPLE.</Text>

This place has many products, dyes and hair not to mention the whole NYX collection, but the owners need to work on their customer service and management. Their treatment and attitude towards their employees is saddening. I only go because their employee and staff is awesome they are helpful! This bussiness only remains by the grace of God lol</text>

<Text>Come here when I need something quick. Agree with a previous post this lady does have issues she just sees me often so doesn't give me much trouble. Once I was in here however, went to the back of the aisle to look at the braiding hair and she's yelling at me can I help you about 6 or 7 times. I said I'm fine a few times but she kept saying can i help you until another patron had to jump in and say, she said she is fine. Hate coming to places like this where Asians don't mind taking our money but want to act like we are going to steal from them. Rarely come into this place. Just go to crown on waterman and olive or tigis in rialto<//Text></record>

I felt like she should go to jail for hate crime, she followed me around the whole store while I was looking and never asked if I needed help when I got closer to the door she asked me if I needed help like I was going to steal a pony tail. She's racist and I was actually debating on buying an $80 wig from her and being a future loyal customer but forget that ! And when I was asking her if she thought I was gonna steal something and why she didn't ask me why I needed help earlier and she just said bye ! Bye! Byee! Like that's some way to treat someone who puts money in your pocket.<//text><Rating>1</Rating>< Name>

<Text>The name says it all. Mini Bar is tiny. So if you're sitting next to a crazy person, you're screwed. There's no place to hide. Except that they now have a parklet because of COVID-19. Long live parklets!< /Text>< user_id>

This is a review for Mini Bar, but the Academy is a cool place on its own too!I've been to Mini Bar several times, but each time we always make sure to walk the exhibits and end the night on the roof with a drink to stare out over the park and at the stars :)<//text>

Service is great. Really enjoyed talking with locals. Great place to meet people for a drink and conversation.<//review>< pics>

Nice decor and music. The volume is perfect for the setting they have created here.
Unfortunately the drink sucked. I ordered an old fashioned with rye straight. The beverage I received is a very small pour of whiskey and a huge* pour of simple syrup. A real shame from a place that advertises as having good cocktails. As a type one diabetic I rely on classic beverages that everyone prepares the same quality. Unfortunately the Mini Bar couldn’t deliver. You will pay less for a better drink virtually anywhere in this neighborhood.</text>< rating>

< Review>
It seemed like a nice little hole in the wall place, but the bartender wouldn't serve our girlfriends because he disagreed with a political conversation they were having with another customer. Furthermore, instead of just being honest and giving us the true reason he wouldn't serve them, he accused them of being drunk. Pretty lame.< /Review>

<review>Mini bar is just that, mini.  This small establishment it a fine place for a drink with great cocktails, jazz playing and some cool art on the walls.  There are some tables up front and a small back room and a arching bar in the middle.  If there are more than about 10 people in the bar it feels kinda crowded.  It is also a challenge to get to the restroom which is precariously places in a tight corner.  Overall though good crowd, good drinks and fun place on Divis.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>Genevieve is a great barkeep and the place is the perfect local bar. It's dark, but not too dark. They play good music which fills the room but isn't too loud. It's a great little bar but tables to spread out onto. Happy hour till 7p is $5 well drinks, $2.50 tecate and if you're lucky they might even give you some chips and Quesa.</Text>< pictures>

I had a Reuben, the sour kraut was super tart, and no Russian dressing. Had to make due with mustard.

The wife had a french dip that was bland.

We both had fries that were hard as rocks.

We still would go for breakfast. Anything else, probably not</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Tons of seating and fast service.

It gives a homie vibe.

Menu can be overwhelming but it is nice to have options.

Parking is convenient and TVs available make it fun to sit to watch. Wifi is available.

Bathrooms are available but only one is available per gender.< /Text><user_id>117706697175244478751</user_id>< rate>

The food, is outstanding. It is fresh and cooked just as requested. They put spice where it needs to be but not too much and not much salt. The portions are huge. The menu is extensive. There is bound to be something there that you like.

There are three areas, the main dining, the bar and the meeting/banquet room. This place is large inside.

The crew is attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable of the menu items. This is a great restaurant to visit. It's probably one of the top three best breakfast spots in the San Jose area.

But you can be the judge of that. See you there. Ciao</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808fcedebf38e9b1:0x6b051f751c60de78<//gmapID></record>

3-17-2020 Called in an order this morning for St. Patrick's tradition (corn beef cabbage, potatoes, carrots, split pea soup). Was ready for pick up within the hour. Outstanding flavors. The split pea soup was to die for...glad you are still open under these circumstances. Love. Love. The meal!!< /text>

My family came in for chicken and waffles.
We got stares and we’re seated. We asked for the chicken breast with the waffles they kept saying we couldn’t do that. We said we will pay extra. The waitress came back and said the owner wouldn’t do it. I said just explain that we willl pay for the breast.. then she said he will only allow us to purchase one breast. However, we were a party of 3. We all wanted the same meal.
Then he said we don’t have but one breast. the waitress was relaying the messages. She came back and forth 7 times. So we just left. Never did we get a bite to eat..<//text>

<text>This restaurant is a damn joke. 2 waitresses waited on my family and I. One waitress offers us water and when we asked for straws, she returns with one but throws it, I asked for 3 more and she returns back to our table eating and throws 3 more and disappears to help other tables. Mind you, there was really only 5 or 6 tables In restaurant this including ours. The food took over an hour and the waitress who took our food down was a joke as well. Rude. No customer service. Heres my questions to alot of rude people who work customer service, why even bother with that job? Maybe find something more your work ethics. I give this place NO STARS but I wanted to write a review.

Side note:

We've been here a handful if times but we always give the benefit of the doubt but today's breakfast was NOT OKAY. Train your workers with better work mannerisms

P.S
Food was served burnt and omelette was a gray color. Disgusting.</text><Date>1561140213143<//Date><user_id>102198044980146591869< /user_id>< gmap_id>

Omega's is my favorite place to take my family for breakfast on the weekend. I love how you can get to know the different employee's that work there. The servers and bus boys are always on top of things and are always very friendly. Awesome place to eat and highly I recommend.</review>

Hair on my cushion soda
Tasted flat im sorry but im
Not impressed....

Extra bag in case you have to barf !
By the way the restroom smelt
Like a big dump...or waste

Usually this place is good but I have no earthly idea what happened today. They drenched my girlfriends mashed potatoes in a red sauce instead of gravy and did not strain the vegetables as there were giant pools of water in the togo container.

I asked them to put onions on my sandwich 2 times: But there were no onions. I asked specifically for no pickles. They kept pickles on there. The potato salad they gave me was definitely rotten. They didn't give us forks either and the lady at the front was pretty rude. She paid more attention to her past bills than me.

Hopefully this was just a fluke but I will not risk my money again. You lost customers today. Ill let you know if I get food poisoning from those potatoes.</Text>

<review>I have been eating at Omega for 30+ years. Always has had good food with large helpings. They serve excellent burgers too! Love the family run atmosphere when the teens come in on Saturdays and Sundays to help during the busy ams. Present owners have improved on the menu. 5 stars</review>< Pictures>

Good food. The service is a joke. I would come here to eat if I wanted my server to give me attitude and dirty looks while I try to order my food. This service is the type you find at the DMV or Police Department. No one wants to be there!</review>

If you're looking for standard American fare and a vintage diner feel, this is a great choice. It has very much the décor of an old rest stop/diner in the seventies, and has maintained clientele with okay prices and decent food. Their burgers are too expensive for what they are, the cheese being basic singles jacked up with preservatives, but they have decent fries and desserts. I recommend their breakfast menu, although that is when they're the most crowded.</text>

This is my favorite place to eat, hands down. I've been eating here for 30 years, since I was a kid. The food is consistently great quality and hearty servings, the service is warm and welcoming, and there's rarely a wait. The menu covers anything you think a diner would serve, plus some more. I love the Maserati omelette, the wings, the pancakes, the club sandwich, the Monte cristo sammich and of course the prime rib on Fridays. I love love love this place. Go here.<//Text>

<review>Great food, great service, great people and environment. Omega has a large dinning area for large crowds and big families. Food came hot and fast, very large menu of food. ive tried a handful of different plates and all were never dissapointing. I will definitely continue to have breakfast here every weekend.</review>< Pics>

This is a great establishment that's been a part of park town history for a long time. I've literally grown up with this diner and have had great service every time. The food is legit diner food, and their bar is cozy and divey. It's been the flavor of Milpitas for decades, and if your new to town it's a proper diner worth checking out. If you haven't checked their bar out either they have great prices on pitchers! Cheers< /review>

We eat here VERY regularly.  We always get hugs & handshakes and smiles!  Mike, Rafeal, Irma, Tiger and more are wonderful!  We miss Gina!
Great food, great values, generous portions.  Best chicken piccata, sweet potato fries, tuna melt, and HOMEMADE ROASTED SALSA in town!  Very filling breakfasts, especially their delicious, nutritious omlettes!  And we have LOST a LOT of WEIGHT over these last two years on their fine meals using these menu choices! Large extra dining area, so never a wait.
Family owned local restaurant with a wonderful history of great service!< /Text>

<review>Ate here for the first time last week.  I had the special 6oz. Steak & Eggs for about $10 and my companion had an avacado & cheese & something meaty omelette for about the same price.  His omelette was huge.  His coffee cup was never empty.  (I had already had my caffeine intake for the day).

<Review>One of favorite restaurants in Milpitas. The staff is wonderful and I am never close to seeing the bottom of my coffee cup. The food is great...I love the omelets and the gyro...My husband loves the hamburgers and their hash. I love the hasbrowns..and my husband loves the country potatoes. We brought a friend of ours a few weeks ago and he loved the shrimp scampi.< /Review>< response>

This is a family run place. They work to get to know you and see you again. The portions are large and the staff is friendly. The food is traditional American diner food.<//Review>

Best "home cooking" in the western european heritage/americana with a slight mexican twist...sense. The steak "ribeye" and eggs breakfast is a must if very hungry. Cozy place with an 80's diner feel. You can chill, have a family gathering, and not seem  rushed. They have an event space too, that would be ideal for a celebration.<//text>

<review>Been looking for a true butcher in Colorado for many years.  Have found nothing in the Springs that even came close to what I was looking for.  This was was a recommendation and boy were they spot on.  It’s 50 miles from Colorado Springs but worth absolutely every mile of the short trip.  Fantastic meat and I will return OFTEN!</review>< Pictures>

Since I found it, it has become my first stop for quick groceries in town.  The prices are super great, and the staff is very nice.  Good selection of low-priced pork cuts and chicken, and they also offer a bunch of marinated meats ready to go on the grill.

Also, they serve lunch, the portions are very large.  They make great burritos and tacos, and also specialize in pupusas (a traditional Salvadorian dish made with masa corn).<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Date>

A hidden treasure in Santa Monica. Vienna style bakery that’s been open for over 50 years. My mom worked in Santa Monica and would always bring us pastry’s home after work. Highly recommended!< /text>

<Review>I just wanted to shout out this classic pastry spot on Wilshire in Santa Monica. It doesn't like you can find places like this very often now. The family business has been around for over 50 years and you can feel the homemade environment the moment you walk in. I don't always love everything I get here but someone always does. I usually buy things here to share with friends at gatherings for for celebrations. Much love to businesses like these in Santa Monica.<//Review><response>None< /response>< name>

The quality was way worth the price and I couldn't have been happier with my choice! The staff is very nice and accommodating. I would definitely come here again.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

A fabulous pastry shop true to its name with many pastries with Austro-Hungarian roots. I've been going here for years and it's certainly the best on the West side. The few negative reviews I read seemed to be based on single experiences. Over all this is 5 stars. And you can't beat the prices they are truly astounding and inexpensive< /text>

I went into Gem & Loan today in Beverly Hills (March 11, 2014) and met with the proprietor who is a very gracious and generous gentleman. He offered me food because it was lunch time, which I politely refused since I was not in the mood to eat. So he extended his generosity and suggested some cake. I said, why not?  When he brought this heavenly treat I couldn't believe it would be that good. I immediately lost my composure and requested more, hoping he had much more.
He stated it was from his cousin's bakery in Santa Monica.  All I want to tell whomever is reading this ... if you enjoy good food, check-out this spot!  You'll thank me later.</text>

<text>Wonderful long-time neighborhood bakery in historic 1940s Art Moderne building on Wilshire Blvd. Tip: Vary your morning routine by picking up delicious pastries here (I recommend the lemon muffins) before stopping at the nearby Starbucks for your coffee. The plentiful metered parking along Wilshire makes this a quick stop. For a special occasion, a variety of beautiful -- and, for the kids, adorable -- cookies and cakes can mark a birthday or any celebration. (Order custom cakes in advance, of course.)<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place is quite cheap, especially considering its location. They have a large selection of baked goods but the staff isn't very good at what they do. When my friend asked what one of the white cake slices was, they responded "Red Velvet." I'm not sure if it was a language barrier or something but if you work in a bakery--I think you should know what each item is. I have tried several of their mini cakes, the eclairs, and the fruit tarts. All of them seemed not as fresh as they should be and reminded me of the desserts at buffets. The staff is not very friendly and stopped my friend from taking a photo of their display--I'm not sure why they don't want people doing that because my friend was just trying to put it in a Yelp review, which would potentially help their business.<//Review>< rate>

My grandmother brought over an alligator pastry. My first bite into it and I felt a sharp pain in the back of my mouth. Turns out they baked a toothpick into the cake! I’m glad I found it otherwise it could have ripped my intestines open.

They should be shut down!</Review>

The representatives that helped us on our first visit were competent, truely caring people, and skilled authentic listeners to our particular needs. Kindness radiated. It was tangible.  When you are in a tough season of life.....and this group came up along side of our needs...goodness is still available in our turbulent world. You are in good hands to do business with this team.<//Text>

<review>So not often when you think Payday Loans sometimes called predatory loans do you think of a GOOD EXPERIENCE (RIGHT?) WELL HOW ABOUT A GREAT EXPERIENCE!? Well that is SPECIFICALLY the kind of experience I ACTUALLY JUST HAD AT A ADVANCE AMERICA LOCATION IN LOMPOC ON H STREET!? I TOO WAS SURPRISED...I SHALL explain...so as I said I had a WONDERFUL experience at Lompoc Srore  995...so heres what went down... Due to some bank errors I found myself in a somewhat confusing situation...I wont get into it to much... but the wonderful work of the manager Marissa as well as the CSR Nora made not just an embarrassing situation and a confusing situation into a positive outcome but we all sort of rable to laugh and smile about it at the end So in closing if you need a little bit of extra cash and you find yourself a little stuck before pay day the advance America located on H street and long poke is not a badd place to not just find the assistance you need but also find smiles and good customer support and service hopefully you'll take my words under consideration the next time you find yourself a little light on cash ....</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

It was a high priority to continue with using StorAmerica as a providing service for my storage concerns. I have had nothing but positive experiences for 3 years when dealing with the Victorville Locust location.

After dealing with a bad experience from another storage company we came here and genuinely felt that our business was appreciated.  The on-site manager was friendly and informative.  The communication was excellent and I felt comfortable with intrusting my belongings with this company. I was immediately grateful that the first place we had looked at was rude. Because of that
rudeness we came here and we got a better deal and a nicer place. Thank you StorAmerica for making our move a little less stressful.<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>After only one month my trailer is broken into. I was told when I rented that they have cameras. BUT when asked for images, there are none. All other footage is viewed except the entry to my property by the suspect. This is poor security. There is also a person living in their car on the premises which they seem to find acceptable. Do not rent from this facility!<//review><Response>{'time': 1593634438628, 'text': 'Dear Ronda,\nWe take security very seriously and have investigated this situation to ensure that our facility is safe. Our camera network thoroughly covers the property, and after reviewing the footage during this time period, we have not found any signs of criminal activity nor have we found any evidence of forced entry into your trailer. This is in addition to our multiple daily security inspections, where we have not found anything suspicious. Although you have requested to see that footage, as per standard protocol, we can only release camera footage once we have a police report filed by the tenant. Please also note that as indicated in our rules and regulations, we do not allow tenants to live on the property. Feel free to contact the office directly at 760-241-6463 to further discuss.\nRegards,\nManagement'}</Response></record></dataset><record>

Very clean and reasonable.  I have been there so long that I haven't established a relationship with management.  They truly do care about their customers and are always willing to help out.  The property is clean and there are lots of cameras on the property to prevent beak ins.  If I could change one thing that would be to be able to access our storage units on holidays.unlike all other storage facilities this one closes on holidays and doesn't allow you access to the property.<//text>

We rented a unit for over 16 years.  Was never late 1 time!!!!!!!
In January of 2017 we couldn't make the $200.00 payment because my husband had been in ICU for almost 2 years.
I was told they would pull out any family pictures & I could pick them up...the rest I just had to let go.  Well my husband passed away on June 26.  I called to find out about our family pictures & was told things that were of no value were just thrown out  :(((((((
They got our $ every single month, including the 'insurance'  they started charging & the special locks we had to pay for.
We had mice or rats that were eating through boxes & destroying clothes.  We told them about & nothing was ever done.
I have never been more disappointed in a company or their employees!!!!!
Do yourself a favor & go somewhere else!!!!!!!<//Text>

The help is very friendly and very helpful and answered any and all questions I had. Worked with me to get the best unit for me. Very direct and on point. Just a bit under staffed. Other than that there was no issues. I highly recommend this location.</text>

Googled storage facilities in my area, contacted StorAmerica in Hesperia. The representative Nicole was so thorough and professional. When we arrived to purchase the storage unit, we had the pleasure of getting Nicole to assist us. She was very polite and made this transition an easy process.  Thank you StorAmerica Self Storage and Nicole.< /review>

<text>Please save your time and money this place is the worst storage I've ever seen.  The employees will tell you one thing and management will tell you something completely different.  The properly manager is  rude and is no help if you have an issue after hours.  I was promised a truck and driver  at 9:30 am.   When I showed up at 9:15 i was  told that yes you are on the schedule but in fact we do not have a driver for you.   We don't schedule our drivers on fridays.   Look else where for your storage needs you'll be happy you did.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1519112914032, 'text': 'Hi Nicole,\n\nThanks for reaching out to us.\n\nAfter looking into this situation and speaking with our staff, you are indeed correct that there was a change to the schedule in regards to our truck and driver being available for your move, however, we were able to rectify the situation and provide you with an alternate driver. Additionally, we allotted you extra time with the truck to compensate for the inconvenience.\n\nUnfortunately, your behavior -- as well as the behavior of your helpers -- appeared to be erratic, aggressive, and disrespectful. Multiple employees have witnessed you screaming and using inappropriate language towards them. Lastly, insisting that our driver assist with loading your items and demanding him to drive above the posted speed limit is against our policies.\n\nBecause of this, we have determined that you would not be a suitable tenant for our facility. As you are aware, we have fully refunded you for your move-in and have subsequently vacated you from our system.\n\nThank you for your understanding,\nManagement'}< /Resp>

I would definitely refer everyone to use this storAmerica. They try thier best to make sure they meet all ur needs. Vanessa made sure i had the best storage for me and worked with me from changing my dates to move in and be able to use the moving truck! I've had other storages and this one tops them all with thier great customer service and thier hard work to make sure they meet all ur needs...<//Review>

Over 3 ENTIRE WEEKS, I asked them for their rates (4 times thru e-mails, &v 2 times with live persons,...AND,...

Despite all  (both e-mail,..& LIVE phone contact requests),..they kept e-mailing me " Hey we're waiting for u to come in & rent with us,..we gave you the rates, so come on in"!

No, they did NOT,..(& I even made this clear 3 times in a row, WORD FOR WORD ON EVRRY CONTACT WITH THEM!(&,  with 2 live persons)!

They will give YOU the "Run Around",....TOO!

Even the place I got their flyer has stopped advertising for them!!

AVOID THESE PEOPLE LIKE THE PLAGUE!</Review>

A customer service person by the name of Jordan is the rudest most disrespectful person you will ever meet. Upon arriving there just before 9 am, she had arrived from getting coffee from what i could gather, i smiled at her she turned her face, i then asked her if she was Vanessa since Vanessa is the person i would talk to over the phone when i would call to discuss my unit since i love in Fontana and they are in Victorville.. So,  she rudely said no, she's inside, so i proceeded to go inside the office to make my payment, where there, was sitting a Hispanic girl , Jordan went behind the counter and rudely asked how she could help me and i said i was there to make a payment on my storage unit and gave her the unit number so she looked it up and proceeded to ask me if my next payment would be made on time and i said i will try to make it on time and she said well if you don't, your going to have to remove your things and i said well when I'm late im the one that pays the late fee so i don't see what the problem is since she made an issue out of it and this upset her so i  then proceeded to talk about the payment i was there to make and handed her my credit card and told her what amount to take from it because i was only paying a portion with my card and the rest in cash, well she didn't listen and took the wrong amount and demanded i pay the rest in cash and i said i only had the exact amount in cash and on my credit card so i didn't have the additional $4 in cash to give her and explained to her that it was her fault because she made the error of taking the wrong amount so needless to say, it turned into an argument which she initiated...i am going to remove my things from this Stor America location and will never use them again  nor will i recommend anybody to use them because of the way i was treated.< /Text>

I had an appointment to get my 2nd COVID shot. There was a shortly line at the regestration desk, but they move quickly. There's a short questionnaire to fill out. As soon as you have it filled out; the nurse escorts you the the vaccination area. The longest time I spent there was waiting the 15 minutes after you go your shot so they can make sure youre not having a reaction. Overall, it is a very smooth and quick process.<//Text>

After waiting quite awhile to talk to a pharmacy  representative, told them that I needed the prescription mailed she replied that "it was in the mail".

Horrible horrible horrible!!  Nurse wouldn't assist with wheelchair up ramp. She said it was a liability issue. It's a fricken medical office - no one can help someone in a wheelchair?  Just wait until someone gets hurt...then you'll have a real liability issue and the stupid nurses will get fired.  What times we are living in!!</text>

Had a late appointment with radiology dept. The receptionist, Keisha, was AMAZING!! So friendly and nice and just an outstanding personality. I know its difficult in customer service based jobs to keep a smile sometimes, but she was just a gem. Definitely the best encounter I've ever had there.< /Review>

<Review>Just terrible service at this place. I came in for a prescription which I was told over the phone I could pick up at this location. I work nearby so I made sure it’d be ok for me to come here. I went during my lunch. Was checked in and I was told 15 minutes for my prescription to be ready. 20 minutes passed so I let them know it had been 20 minutes. I gave them my Driver’s license I’m guessing to verify it’s me picking up the meds. 10 more minutes pass by so I told them to give me my stuff back so I can go back to work. They walk me in to the pharmacy and tell me my prescription is at another Kaiser and they needed approval to bring it here. Not once did I updated about that or that it’d be longer. It would have been nice to know it was gonna take 45 minutes or longer right off the bat. I wasted my lunch waiting for nothing. Called member services to file a complaint, they placed me on hold and hung up on me. Just terrible service from Kaiser. In the past I’ve had good experiences with Kaiser. Today, at this location l, was not one of them. Don’t go to this location. Bad set up too. They have you waiting for your meds by an urgent care check in area. Sick people coming in while you wait for your meds.<//Review>< Rate>

I’ve been a Kaiser member for over 30 years - well over 30 years - and I have never had a bad experience timewise with them. If you’re in a hurry, order your prescriptions online or by phone and they’ll be mailed to your home very quickly (you can’t do this with controlled medications like Vicodin but it’s a real timesaver since they say 7-10 days but it’s always much less.)
As far as waiting time to see a doctor that has never been an issue for me; it’s always been within 15 minutes and usually less.
My primary care doctors have always been great in listening to what I have to say and then talking over with me what they advise (‘using the smallest hammer’). I feel very safe with their evaluations.
As far as employees being rude or dismissive, I think that patients forget that they’re human too and that a friendly word goes a long way. Once a woman in line in front of me was so nasty to the check-in lady, knowing full well she couldn’t respond in kind,  that I felt I had to say something and I did. You have absolutely no right to abuse someone who is just doing their job. You get back what you give out and if you’re being rude or abusive you won’t be getting back lilies.</Text>

The older white male nurse at the Urgent Care check in is extremely rude. He didn’t acknowledge me at all when I walked up just stared and when I said my reason for being there he rolled his eyes and made a face then said well that’s the cause in a sarcastic tone. I was throwing up and he didn’t even give me a throw up bag he just rudely gave me the purple card and said go over there. Staff is always rude at this location and it’s annoying when someone doesn’t feel good and they one, act like they know what is wrong and brush it off like a whatever thing and two, the employee has some personal attitude and they take it out on us. Filing a complaint.< /Text>

<review>I went with my daughter who had a bad skin infection (MRSA).  They were very busy (Friday evening 8pm.)  It  took awhile to be seen by a doctor (2 hours).  But they were very efficient with their time, and yours,  once you've been seen. They were very informative and thorough during the visit.  I love how you can get your prescription filled at the same location right after your visit.  Usually my daughter would pay a hefty co-pay at the Urgent Care, but because we spoke to someone there about how high it was ($150.00) they asked her to fill out a form they gave her, and later, found out she qualifies for their $0.00 co-pay program because she's a full time college student with a qualifying income.  You have to re-qualify every 6 months but it was So Worth it!!  I would recommend to everyone (if they're having trouble affording their co-pays) to ask if there is a discount program they might qualify for.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I've been coming to this office for 11 years now and it's the best Kaiser ever. Parking is always good and the wait is never long to see my doctor or my kids pediatrician. Also the lab is so quick as well as the radiology department and the pharmacy. Nice staff and great doctors and care :)<//Review>

<review>The pharmacy is the problem when you got a wait for medicine when you have pre- ordered it online and then you get there and they tell you it’ll be twenty minutes to twenty five minutes in the computer tells you when you have already ordered that it’s ready to be  picked up and you get there one is ready and the other one is not.And then they start making excuses I personally think somebody needs to come down and have a meeting and change their policy to make it better Because right now it’s not working. And they don’t care trust me on that one And the famous words they tell you I am  (sorry)</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>The entire staff at the Kaiser Permenente Medical Offices in La Mesa have always treated me very well.  I book my appointments online to see my regular doctor which is super easy and convenient.  I also appreciate the self check-in when I arrive.  If and when the wait times go beyond my appointment time, I always get an apology for the wait.  It's easy to talk trash about having to wait beyond an appointment time, but you know, that's just life sometimes.  I just assume that my doctor is extending the same courtesy to the patients before me, that he is extending to me.  He doesn't make me feel rushed at all and I appreciate that.  The lab seems to be very efficient and I've never had to wait long in there.  The pharmacy has quite a work load based on the number of people I usually see waiting, but again, I can't complain about that. I expect to have a small wait and it's never been more than 15 - 20 minutes.  For me, not the end of the world.  I can't speak for urgent care since I haven't had reasons to use it in many years.  I would recommend this medical office.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

They currently have my glasses and no copy of anything, I had to take a picture of the refund form with my smart phone. I filed a complaint with membership services and even they are baffled at why i was not given a copy of my return, especially since they took my product and issued zero money back to me.

<review>Excellent staff and facility ... I came in really sick and had a syncope episode as i went to check in. Next thing I know I had a nurse pushing me on the W/C and I was inside the room and the doctor was waiting for me. They took care of me quickly kept me there for 4-5 hours until they felt it was safe for me to leave. I knew I wasn’t well and didn’t want to go to ER and I’m glad I made the decision to come here. Thank you for treating me like your relative and not a complete stranger. I can’t say I’d expect more then healthcare professionals really caring for their patients but you just don’t see that treatment much else where.< /review>< pics>

Pediatrics runs very efficiently. Always in and out within a reasonable amount of time and staff is polite and friendly. Same goes for the lab, the pharmacy can be a challenge at times but than again it serves a really big facility. Can't say much about urgent care tho, haven't really had the need to use it (thank god) except once but couldn't due to their unreasonable hours for an urgent care facility. I showed up right after 5 and they were already closed. Came to find out they open 8-5.< /Text>

< review>
I just needed to go to urgent care; that's it. I get up to the front desk and immediately the woman was very impatient. For once there was no line. So why? Anyways I explained my problem and she completely ignored what I said began writing down On that purple slip something completely different. I let her know that was not why I was there. And she immediately went to say " then we can't help you. Maybe try the ER". I don't need the ER, just urgent care. I'm not here because I "want" to be here. I'm here for help. Which I was completely denied.<//review>

Urgent care advised it would be a 3 hours wait. I'm fine with that. However, also was advised to wait in overflow waiting room. Listen for my name. When I heard it and made it to door, they had already went back inside.
5 seconds....
Then triage  nurse gave me attitude when I asked what happened. He said he walked over to waiting area several times calling me. Which was not true...sick people do not need this kind of treatment no matter how busy it is..3rd time I've had bad service at this location.<//Text>

They’re only interested in helping you if you don’t require much. Dr. seemed bothered like he was in a rush to leave. After constantly looking at his watch, he told me I should go to ER 10 miles away and that the hospital, “might have a short wait”. This is so far the worst experience I have ever had with Kaiser!!!<//text>

Everyone I dealt with at the La Mesa Radiology Department was wonderful.
Dr. Gerber is the best and his staff are kind and caring
young ladies that helped me from being so scared.
I just can't say enough good things about all of them. Debbie, the lady that does the mammograms is so nice and made me feel comfortable in a difficult situation. You are all wonderful and professional.
Thank you for everything.

<Text>I went to Urgent Care on Sunday afternoon around 3.  The purpose of my visit was horrendous sudden onset pain in my back and elsewhere and vomiting because of the pain.  The wait was very short and I immediately was put on fluids, they did blood work, they treated me and I was out of there a little while after closing -- with no pain.  The care I received was exceptionally good and I was very pleasantly surprised at my first use of "Urgent Care".< /Text><Name>Mickey Zeichick<//Name></record></dataset><record>

<review>I waited one hour and fifteen minutes to even get my name called. Then all they did was take  my blood pressure and kick me back into the waiting room.  About 15 minutes later they bring me back to a small room,  ask a few question, of which some of the listed information on my chart was incorrect and then I am given a hospital gown to put on. I sit there in a small box of a room for 1.5 hourse before a P.A. comes in.  He is in a rushed state, asks me what is wrong, but hardly lets me finish. He does a speedy, and I mean speady exam and does not even touch my shoulders and neck area where I said was some of the pain. When I begin explaining a little more since he did not address the whole pain area he stops me by telling me to listen to him. He cut me off! He was rather rude. After that I did not want to have anything to do with him.  The P.A. also said If it would make me  happy he would order an X Ray of my back. Very professional. The moral of the story is wait and get about 8 minutes and a curt rushing Physician's assistant who seems to not to take a patient seriously.  I won't be using La Mesa Urgent care again.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I brought mom to the La Mesa Kaiser facility for a CT scan on 6/5/18 only to find out the GE scan machine was broken  The assistant mentioned they'd been having trouble with it all day  I'm wondering why they didn't have the foresight to call patients to give them a heads up? When you're elderly and on chemo, it takes a lot of energy to walk into the appointments. This was also a waste of gas and time.</review>< Pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I go to the La Mesa office for my annual eye exam and all contacts/glasses needs. This review is for the Optometry department as a whole because I always receive great service when I'm there. This experience in particular was exceptional. The annual exam was quick and easy and the wait time to see the doctor was no more than 5 min. Dr. Pham is super easy to talk to and answered all my questions and concerns. After the exam, I decided to come back to get my glasses as I pressed for time. When I came back the following week to order contacts and buy some glasses - Hannah and Lashonda helped me through the whole process. Hannah helped me choose glasses that I actually LOVE (for once haha) and I didn't feel rushed at all. I may or may not have tried on at least 20 glasses that day. After I finally chose some glasses, Lashonda really took the time to explain my benefits and guided me through that whole process. Thank you Hannah and Lashonda for all your help that day! It's greatly appreciated! It's because of this type of service, that I continue to trust Kaiser for all my medical needs.</Text>< Pictures>

This place is racist and not professional
The check in front desk people are not knowledgeable and are racist especially the person Veronica who I overheard calling the security instead of the calling Carol the supervisor who I was waiting for 4 hours and she didn't show up at all.
As well as the doctor Daniel.sleig and his fat nurse who was my doctor totally avoided me because I was Black they asked me to wait until 8pm when my appointment was at 3pm. I work 7days a week, I took appointment and a day off to see the doctor I waited for 4 hours and didn't see the doctor and got another appointment. All because this person Veronica who is dumb and not knowledgeable calls the security and tells him to "scare him" while she was the person asked me to wait and I was not seen by anyone except the security who kept on telling me to take another appointment while I had no problem waiting.
Will not recommend this hospital to no one<//Text>

I have always received excellent service from this office and am very happy with my doctor. The only time I was dissapointed was on my last visit, I checked in 20 min early, they had asked me to check in 15 min early, I waited the 20 min and assumed I would be called up soon after. I waited another 20 min after my appointment before I was called in. While I sat there waiting, I watched other people who came in after me get called in first. Either they were late and still got called up or they just forgot about me. After i was called in, the nurse took my vitals right away, then i waited for the doctor another 15 min. Alot of waiting around Bt I'm usually ready for that at any hospital or doctors office I go to, so I still give this clinic 3 stars because the staff was kind. I only wish they would have excused themselves for the wait time.</Text>

Called to ask if I can still take Flonase even though my meds have changed. Got through to someone after 10 minutes got told that I needed to be screened by a nurse before anything could happen, was on hold another 15 minutes before I hung up then was promptly called back saying oh there's only 15 people in front of you. I told the guy that I was in the process of calling the pharmacy when he interrupted. I then proceeded to call the pharmacy which turned out to be a multi pharmacy phone number, then was promoted, "for my convenience, call this tool free number." I mean, how is that convenient? I just had to call another number and wait longer. I then sat on hold for about 20 minutes before I hung up again, trying to call another Pharmacy and it did the same f****** thing again. Call the toll-free number for my convenience. A f****** hour later and I still don't have an answer to a simple f****** question. Don't get Kaiser if you want to actually be treated. On top of all this, I have 5 bulging discs, a crushed L1, and severe spondylosis at L3 and 4. I am 20. They refused to do anything about it, short of injections that last all of two weeks and belittled me, as usual, saying, "oh you have MAYBE a 30 year olds back." that is utter BS. How many 30 year olds do you know that have these kind of problems? My 70 year old grandpa has a healthier spine than I do. Freaking pill pushers, man. Seriously, get anyone other than Kaiser.<//Text>

<review>We waited for 2 hours to see a dr. after one girl who came after us asked nurse if she can take her in now cause " she needs to go to work" and ofcourse she gets called next. We still waited and waited. Initial exam was done in 3 min and check out time about 45. Ridiculous. I know its a busy place but what we saw today was unethical.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I don't understand why it takes at least 2 hours to be seen even with an appointment. Not once or twice but EVERY visit we wait for a minimum of 2 hours. It takes an hour just to get into a room and another hour or more to actually be seen.<//text>

<review>I heard great things about this place and I go there and my order was nothing of what I asked for I order a burrito with beans and rice on the side and no guacamole and I get home look at my order and it has all of this on my order. I also order shrimp tacos and my tacos was nothing but shrimp and bread. I'm highly disappointed in this restaurant. I've worked at a restaurant and I understand it gets busy but that is no excuse to mess up on someone's meal they are paying for. If I was allergic to the things I asked to not be on there and i ate that burrito not knowing what was in the burrito It would have been a serious problems< /review><pics>None</pics><userid>101608918513431621000<//userid>< date>

I went for a pick up order during a busy time around 630pm. There were 5 pick ups and 1 person paying a bill from the table. The blonde waiter with glasses was running around packing orders, answering phones, and ringing up customers. While the other waiter with the burgundy hair was standing next to her talking to someone just sitting at the bar. I legit was waiting 10 min to be rung up and the entire time that chick was chatting casually. 😒 I felt bad for blondie.< /Review></record>

< Review>
One of the best Mexican food restaurants in all of California, in my opinion!
I haven't been here in about 20 years since moving to the east coast. It is as good as I remembered it! The hot sauce is hand-made and is the best I have ever had!!< /Review>

Always great food, the girls are always very friendly and attentive. I used to go to Favelas but not anymore, Favelas can’t compare to Murrillo’s on Merchant St.< /Review>

My friend and I stayed at the nearby hotel America's Best Value Inn while on a road trip from Oregon going into San Fransisco. While we stayed at the Value Inn we saw Murillo's next door. Without having to drive anywhere and a short walk, we decided on going to Murillo's for cold beers, margaritas, chips/salsa and dinner. It was everything that we were looking for. Basic overall. The interior was your traditional Mex. theme going on, cantina area to hang out in. As it was super hot out the day we were there, the cold beers and the flavored margaritas hit the spot. The food was fairly basic, but it served its need while we were living on the road.< /Review>

<Text>It's a little expensive, but the food is good.  My son wanted to get 2 chicken and 2 beef mini tacos, but they said no.  Has to be 4 of one or the other so we were disappointed by that.  But the good is good, and you can eat out front, which is good too.<//Text></record>

<text>Pretty disgusting. I thought this place was going to be amazing since there was a banner outside advertising that it had won awards. The service was great. Unfortunately if you choose to sit in the front it's kind of cramped and the food was so bland. It wasn't nearly one of the better Mexican restaurants I've visited. There was 1 salsa that tasted ok but, me nor my party finished the food. It just wasn't good. The taste of authenticity wasn't present anywhere in the building....sorry for my honesty 👎🏽🤷🏽</text></record>

Wonderful to go and have great consistent service and good food. Affordable and good portion size. It has been there a long time and service and price so good, I can understand why. Is so nice to have a place where memories are good then and now.</Review>

Chips and salsa are great. Worst Chile Relleno I have ever had. It was barely edible. I asked my wife to try it because she thought I was exaggerating, and she had to spit it out because it was so bad. So, my wife shared her  Paco with me, which was tasty.< /review>

It was Taco Tuesday, but had the Flautas. Staff are very friendly. I was able to pick where I wanted to sit, and since it was busy, I picked the first available booth, which sat about 4-5. As they couldn't find seating for a few women they asked if I was ok sharing the booth. I was. Very pleasant, friendly, fast service despite how busy they were.<//Review>< resp>

We have been eating at Murillo's since 1971. No matter where we have traveled, Murillo's has and still is the best and most authentic Mexican food we have been able to find. From hot sauce and homemade chips, to enchiladas you would be hard pressed to find anyplace that puts the dedication and consistency of quality you will find at Murrillo's. They are the ones we have come to judge all the others against. We highly recommend you try it for yourself.< /Review>

<text>This location is small and quaint. Their chips and salsa are always on point. The salsa is not chunky like you find at many restaurants. It's warm and smooth which I find to be delicious. My favorite dish to get is the half paco. The regular size is big enough for 2 people.<//text><username>Lacey Freese< /username>< time>

One of the best kept little secrets in Vacaville. Murillo's sits next to Pacific Ace Hardware. This is the very best Vacaville has to offer in Mexican food. Had a breakfast omelette stuffed with ham and chilies. I love hot food..salsa is delish with their fresh warm chips..best refried beans. My friend had shredded beef tacos said they the tacos are the best. The servers are friendly and very good at what they do. Thank you to what I call the best Mexican food has to offer. Try it when you visit Vacaviile. Murillo's on Merchant St in downtown Vacaville..The best<//Text>

Can be easy to miss this place from the street unless you know what you're looking for, but this is a must go place for Mexican comfort food! Portions are good sized and absolutely delicious. Service is very kind, no nonsense and down to earth.< /Text>

<Review>The best place for Mexican food anywhere in Solano county and my favorite restaurant!!  I live in Fairfield and come to Vacaville all the time just to eat here.  Real authentic Mexican food at great prices.  Also a decent selection of foreign and domestic beers to accompany your meal.  Murillos is a must go!!</Review>< user>

<Text>The beans were watery and runny. The rice was undercooked. Everyone in our party ordered something different but somehow it was all either wet or runny or covered in so much sauce you couldn't see the actual dish. The food in general was bland and unimpressive. Service was slow, but hurried and nobody seemed to want to be there. The only star is for the chips and salsa. The chips were hot and fresh and the hot salsa was good. I dont think I'll ever understand Vacaville's obsession with this place, as there are easily 5 other Mexican restaurants within a few minutes' drive that are way better.</Text><GmapID>0x80853d57d5d77ab1:0x2a18917a06873a68< /GmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Doordashed for food because I was hungry. I specially asked for no beans and all rice, but what I got when I opened it up was all beans and no rice. I don't like beans, so it basically was a waste of money and I had to throw it away because I don't like beans.<//Review>

My wife and I come here every time we visit Vacaville. The atmosphere inside is nothing special but their food is amazing. Especially their enchilada sauce and cheese. They will put cheese on top of your rice and beans if you ask... which in our opinion = delicious. Oh and also great chips and salsa!< /review>

<review>I've been coming here since I was a baby. Best comfort food ever. My family wo you old drive from Napa for their shredded beef tacos and their chips and salsa (warm taco sauce) so good. The ambience is nothing special but up until recently the same women waited on us since 1977. It's my personal favorite, my mom ate it when pregnant with me, and I ate it CRAVED IT when pregnant with my daughter, now the three of us eat it and love it.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I love this place for lunch!!!  The chips and salsa are superb.  I just can't get enough of them!  The service is fast and friendly.   I have yet to have something from their menu that I did not like.</Text>

Been going to Murillos (on Merchant) for 5 years and food has always been great.  But lately, I assume they are having a hard time finding cooks.  The food varies greatly as of late. Recently had the 3 tostados  and the chicken was honestly COOL (not quite cold and very runny with water.  Refried beans were less than luke warm.  Very unpleasant.  Never used to be that way.  Staff is great though</text>

I’ve been going to Murillo’s since 1985 and the food is always consistently great. Whenever I go over to Vacaville I always try to go there for lunch or dinner. Best Chile Relleno I’ve ever had hands down. Everything else is good as well like their Chile verde ,tacos, etc...</text>

This place is horrible. If I could give less than one star, I would. The salsa tastes exactly like warm tomato soup. The cheese dip is nacho cheese from a can. (I know because I asked)
I ordered a pitcher of bottom shelf margarita for the table @ 28$!
The chicken smelled like tuna fish from a can.
I was with a group of 5 and all of us had stomach issues after eating here.
Please do not go here.< /text>

Great local Vacaville-Mexican cuisine.  The food leans toward an American perspective of Mexican food, but it's good, real good.  Vacaville is steeped in Mexican and American history.   It
is appropriate that Murillo's reflects both.< /review>

<Text>I usually just get the enchilada lunch platter which comes with refried beans and rice. It's a simple, oily, Mexican food plate that you eat by scraping your fork sideways to scoop. I would say that, while there are some deficiencies in Mexican food in Vacaville, Murillo's is consistently average. Which is just fine by me as there's nothing worse than expecting greatness and being let down.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>Still a great place to go for good mexican food. Service is always fast. Chips and salsa are amazing! Not so glam but when you taste the food you will know why everyone in Vacaville comes here! Two plate specials is the way to go, rice/beans and you choose your two items: taco, enchilada, chile rellenos, tamales...great house specialities too!<//review>< pictures>

I love this place! Great authentic Mexican food. Owned and operated by a local family. There are two locations. The original is in the downtown area of Vacaville and parking can  be a little tight the other location is much larger and has plenty of parking in the back. It is right off the freeway near the famous Nut Tree and even RVs would be able to park in the back. I am an extreme Mexican food fan and Murrillos is one of my favorite spots. The dinner menu is awesome and the combo plates let you try up to three different items in one plate. The mini paco is amazingly large and delicious. The Jalisco burrito is awesome but it doesn't come with rice and beans sadly. The lunch menu is not as good a value. I ordered enchilada lunch and a coke. It came to over 12.oo and it came with only 1 enchilada. First time I have ever left hungry. Go for dinner NOT A GOOD LUNCH STOP Chips and salsa are great and home made. Interestingly that hot salsa is served cold and the mild salsa is served warm.< /Text>

Believe it or not, when I'm in Vacaville, I will seek them out. Nothing real special, but consistently "good". I do recomend the Paco Taco.....AWESOME< /text>< Pics>

Food wasn't up to par. Very greasy and kinda cold. Very busy and a lot of to go traffic. Maybe door dash is ruining one of my fav spots.< /Text>

<Text>So I had to make another trip and try lunch, and was not dissatisfied at all.  Service was just as prompt, friendly and courteous as it was for dinner.   Portions remained good size, meal was again served quickly and piping hot.  The enchiladas we're as close to a Tex-Mex that I grew up eating and so I would definitely recommend sitting down and trying a meal.  Staff is friendly, family owned and take great care in treating their patron's well.  I've had both lunch and dinner and no matter which time they remain consistent with both quality and service.

Had a nice dinner, went in about 5:30, and was able to get a table on this Saturday.   Good service, good good, nice portions for the value.  Served with chips and salsa, both regular and spicy. I had a combination plate, 2 items, with the enchilada (beef) which was delicious, and a chilli relleno which was good, served with rice and beans. Food was served extremely prompt and was served piping hot.  My server was courteous, prompt and polite, and it was packed at the time I had dinner.  If in the area it's a good place to dine. Restaurant was clean, and practice safe protocol, and staff all wore mask.<//Text><user>117672440790907738243< /user></record>

This place has definitely gotten more expensive over the years but who can blame them in today's economy right. Overall their selection is large and full of all different sizes styles and prices. I dont really care for the sudden price raise but the quality of the merchandise is well worth it</Text>

Store was great. Lots of items for everyone. Not as crowded as I thought. Well kept (racks and shelves not over stocked, not ran through looking or messy). The parking lot is something else. I seen a honk off between three cars for a front row parking which was nuts, while another honk off  started. In which I seen a middle-aged​ woman yell to someone in the handicap parking right in front of the store. Asking if the person whom parked there, was aware that it was a handicap parking...the woman was elderly with a cane and said I am handicap. But overall satisfied with my day visit to the city and store from 92 miles away.< /text>

There is always a greeter at the door. More often than not, they don't have the right sizes I need. Finding things you want here are hit or miss. Most things are a cheap price and good quality.<//review>

I think it's more the patrons fault than the employees, people just would take stuff off the rack then leave it laying on top of another rack.

Oh my, what didn't I like about dds..?! I bought 4 pair of shoes. A pair of pants, a blouse lotion air freshener and a few other things for only $40.00.  It's a relaxing atmesphere no one is watching over your shoulder. Their prices are very affordable and everything is priced. It's really your one stop shop.</review>

I love the odd things you can find here that would be super pricey elsewhere, still good though and the employees are friendly and they seem passive and chill in a good way . Security here is awesome really cool and chill . They still take their work serious too. So don't underestimate them either.< /review>

Google states that the store closes at 10pm on Saturday, but the door was closed before 9pm we wanted to go in but the female security was playing her phone inside and told us it is closed! So disappointed!!!!!!!! If it closes at 9, it should say closes at 9 instead of 10 pm on the website. Please update your business hours!!!!!!!!😡<//Review>

I found what I needed at great prices. The only complaint is that the store seems to be messy and understaffed.< /review>

Went to return something and I didn't have my debit card, I had my receipt. They wouldn't give me the cash. My choice was store credit or nothing.
I think they should've asked me did I have my card before starting the transaction not when it's the last part of it.< /Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Well, there are good things and bad things looking for something good to grab, but before I was well stocked, I imagine that everything is due to the virus and the economy. But it's a good place if you don't want to spend a lot of shoes. I do not recommend breaking them and they last you a maximum of 1 week

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very good place to find what you need. The only thing I do not understand how people throw things away and do not pick it up, it is something unpleasant to have to jump or trample things with the carts. I try to pick up but it is impossible since it's in almost the entire store ..

(Original)
Muy buen lugar para encontrar lo que nesecitas.lo unico que no entiendo como la gente deja tiradas las cosas y no la recoje, es algo desagradable tener que andar brincando o pisoteando las cosas con los carritos.yo trato de recojer pero es imposible ya que es en casi toda la tienda..</Review>< Pics>
