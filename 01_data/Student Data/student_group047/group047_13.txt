<Rating>4</Rating><review>Perfect place, perfect ambience! I visited this library a few months back and I was very much impressed with its location, lighting, pleasing atmosphere, available topics and arrangement of books, ease of location and access, nice seating, all make it a beautiful library that you feel you should visit often. The registration is very simple and immediate that you can start borrowing number of books and videos at once. You have books on all topics, say, Fiction, non- Fiction, technical, political, educational and so on. You can browse through monitors and make a choice on author or title. This is a free library.
I was surprised to see that there are books on Indian languages like Tamil too.
You have video section too serving movie buffs and others. Number of DVDs and Blu-ray  movies, starting from age old 60's to modern day wait for you to grab. They have latest too. I was delightd to see some old movies too in their collection. There are interesting topics on non-fiction too.
You have facilities for copying, reading leisurely, self ticketing to borrow etc. Rest rooms are good. Parking is very nearby.
The staff are friendly and helpful. You can extend the books on line if required.
This library has kid section too, which is a plus point. While the reading habits are slowly coming down, the introduction of books to children  at an early age is a must to search and gain knowledge instead of digital hunting, Copy-Paste attitude.
Another thing I should mention is the beautiful architecture of the building. Lovely and invites you to visit.
The authorities should be appreciated for all their efforts in maintaining this treasure house of books in excellent condition. Hats off to them!
A place you must visit .< /review>< Pics>

It's a really good place to study with maximum concentration, the staff there is very polite and helpful. There are conference rooms available for booking in advance if you want to have a group meeting. A very vast variety of books and DVDs are available including a whole kids section. It is well maintained, the entire place is very clean. Recommended for a good study routine!</review>

Nice Library!!!! WARNING🚫🚫🚫 But bored & bad cops wait in the parking lot to give out tickets for tags & etc. But parking is free. So sad cant even do anything positive and they will mess with you. I continue to travel and try out new libraries.< /Text>

One of the best libraries in Santa Clara county that has interesting educational programs and activities. My children really like all the fun programs from which they have learned variable skills. Friendly and helpful staff. Clean and mostly quiet environment. We enjoy coming to this library.</text>

<Text>Excellent remote working place. Quite spacious with plenty of working desks, technology center and plenty of open space.  Great coffee shops closeby. Super friendly staff. A bit noisy sometimes with kids, which is good to break the monotony. The book sections seem relatively small, but works for me.</Text>< Pics>

Awesome library! They have great workshops . I attended the LinkedIn for entrepreneurs and small businesses and also they had a free photo taken event where they take your photo for free for your LinkedIn profile. They also welcome residents from other cities. I  stop by  the Rivermark plaza where the library is located after work for my snacks but don't actually live in the area.</Text>

The library is very well organized and located in a great place besides the Rivermark plaza. The staff is nice and prompt. Parking space is a bit limited, as well as book selection, but that is easily solved by requesting books from other libraries to be delivered there.<//Text>

< Review>
The facilities are great and the desks, computers are all new. But in my personal view, a library should be a place where people can read, study, or do other academic work in peace.

However, it is TOTALLY the opposite here. It is so loud. Children run around, occasionally shouting, and parents seems to think that is totally okay. This place is more a day care than a library.

I wish the staff could advise the parents more heavily to remind their children that they are in a library, not a playground.</Review>

< Review>
Great. The place where I love to go every time I can.

There are lot of things anyone can appreciate about library.
Its location is just perfect. Located in river mark market place. You can get almost everything here. Even you might seeking for hair saloon or dentist or cuisine or Safeway or what. Behind library there is big playground too. Parking near library is plus point.
Available facilities are so high that you will overwhelm with those. One day I was asking for librarians that how much books I can take at a time. I was shocked with answer and ask her again. I was not able to believe on my ears. She said 60.
You can renew any book online. There is online catalog available too. Plus anybody can request to HOLD book. Even you can check availability of book. It will give you name of the branch where book is. Reminder for book renewal from library. 2-3 days before. There are always lot of social events going on in library. One can register for it online.
My most favourite part, why I go library every time is for kids. Yes. There is seperate area for kids. Lot of books for toddlers too. Almost on every friday they have story time at 10.30am. Family story time. If its not,  they will update on events calendar. There are many events organised by library for different age groups of kids and adults too. Story time is the best time. My daughter and I both love it.
About the architecture and all it is just perfect. Areas are segregated as per adult and children. Fiction and nonfiction etc. Water fountain, washrooms eveything is available. Copy machine too. Self check out is also there. Many computers provide express check out. Charging point on every table. Group study rooms are there. You can book. One can use library screen for work or search purpose. Behind main library there is some open space. Where you can park  stroller and rest on benches over there.
There are lot of positive thing one must share about this library.  I must say thank you to all  librarians who help me everytime I go there, in everything I need.</Review>

<review>A comparatively new and clean library with great staff and engaging programs. But there are a few areas for improvement: 1) small isles make both book searching and reading at the desk a challenge; 2) there's not enough QUIET zone for reading, more desks on the children reading section than adult side; 3) there's no shades in the garden which makes the space a white elephant.</review><gmap_id>0x808fc975895448cd:0x485e82470495f7e1</gmap_id>< Pics>

THE GOOD: It's convenient to be able to reserve books and have them available for pick up here because it's so close to my home. It seems to have a lot of community events. The staff is friendly and helpful.

THE CAN'T BE HELPED: The book selection here is pretty limited, which is to be expected since it's so small.

THE BAD: It's incredibly noisy. Apparently, libraries are no longer a quiet haven for readers and students but a place for noisy children to run around unattended. Serious negative points for this.<//Text>

<Review>Basically Indian day care. Lots of parents bring their kids here and let them cry and be loud. No one, not even the staff, has the decency to enforce a quiet atmosphere. It kind of defeats the purpose of a library if they let it turn into a day care.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>Story time is just sad when the branch manager is leading. She has no idea how to work with toddlers and make it fun.  Soon after ir starts she loses her patience because kids are not interested in her boringness and it just becomes a mess. I wish she would get a clue and have the other people (like Angela) run story time since she clearly is not cut out for the program.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Please increase hours at a few libraries, have a few 24 hr libraries or open very early rather than having so many fancy smhancy branches. Public libraries are the last place where people with no/few resources can gain the knowledge and skills to compete with people with much higher resources. Investment in public libraries have way more multiplier effects and lead to social mobility than investment in roads and fancy buildings. This is especially true in Silicon Valley where the high cost of living keeps people with low resources out. Incumbents will always try to increase the barrier to entry and to create monopolies, and it will protect their interests in the short term. However in the long term, these incumbents who try to build barriers to entry will drive the innovators away to Texas or Boston with much lower cost of living, leading to lower innovation and SV will die a slow death. You as public libraries have this opportunity to lower the barrier to entry and drive innovation and growth in SV more than any other entity, if you chose to take on this role.</Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a really good library.
It is a library that feels like family and children come together rather than quietly studying. You should think of it as white noise, like studying in a cafe.
If you don't want to rent a book even if you just visit, you can go in and study right away. Some small books are sold, so you can buy used books at low prices.

정말 좋은 도서관 입니다.
조용히 공부를 하기보다는 가족과 아이들이 함께 오는 느낌의 도서관 입니다. 카페에서 공부하듯이 백색 소음이라고 생각해야 할것 같습니다.
그냥 방문하여도 책을 대여할것이 아니라면 바로 출입해서 공부를 할 수 있습니다. 작게 책을 파는 곳도 있어서 싼가격에 중고 책도 구입할 수 있습니다.< /Review>

<review>It was my 4 year olds 1st time at the dentist and my daughter's first time at that office and let me tell you they where hands down amazing. They listen and wrote down all of my concerns. They where so patient with my little one and throughout the cleaning process make sure to tell the kids how wonderful they there doing. The doctor was very detailed in telling me steps that needed to be taken. She took her time and examined my kids teeth thoroughly. The staff where all bubbly lol and just a job to talk to. Over all 5 stars 10/10. I would recommend them to everyone.<//review>< gmap_id>

I can't say enough great things about this dentistry. They go above and beyond to make my now 3 year comfortable and safe. She has been a patient here since she was 6 weeks old for a tongue tie release. Dr. Hannanvash is wonderful at explaining everything that is happening with your little one. She is incredibly patient as well. The atmosphere is great for kids and there is ample parking at the office.<//text>

<text>It had been a while since my child (5yr) had last been seen by the dentist and I was terrified of being judged. However, as soon I walked in the door I felt welcome! My son is extremely shy but quickly warmed up with the friendly staff and amazing exam room. His favorite part was being able to watch Finding Nemo, on the ceiling while he got his teeth cleaned. His next appt. is in 6mos and he has already requested that I mark his calendar so he can count down the days!<//text>< response>

The Doctor and all of her staff are amazing! The entire experience from calling to make an appointment to get my baby checked for tongue ties, to the actual procedure and all of the follow up has been the best experience it can be. Little Star and Dr. Najmeh came highly recommended to me and I also highly recommend this place!< /Review>

We started going to Little Star a few months back when my daughter needed a lip & tongue tie revision. As a first time mom, I was extremely nervous but Dr. Hannanvash was absolutely amazing. Walked me through every step of the entire process. My daughter continues to be a patient with her office & with every visit, I’m just more satisfied with Hannanvash & her staff. They’re so kind, thorough, & I’m always in & out of their office with minimal wait time. I feel so comfortable bringing my daughter there. It’s truly an amazing office.<//text>

My 4 month old needed a tip and tongue tie release. The dentist did and great consultation. She told me the procedure would take 5-6 minutes. From the time they left the room and came back, it was only 3.

My toddler had X-rays, an exam, and cleaning. The assist who did the X-rays was GREAT! My son did not cry once. She used a lot of kid friendly words and referred to characters from movies to keep him connected.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

My 2 month old son had his lip and tongue tie releases done here and Dr. Najmeh did amazing! And it was super fast; my baby was away from me for less than 10 minutes! Every staff member has been really helpful and pleasant to work with, too. I live an hour away from their location but IT IS WORTH IT.< /Text>

Nice facility, friendly staff, informative dentist. I took my daughter in on recommendation from my sons dentist for a lip tie. We discovered a tongue tie as well. Absolutely not what I wanted to find and I’m really bummed my daughter needs a correction but I honestly knew the recommendation before I headed there. I’m relieved that a confident dentist who knows what they’re doing and can easily explain the procedure to me is the one doing it. I definitely cried during my daughters appointment today because I dont think any parent wants their child to have to have a procedure. however, I’m happy to have been connected with this dentist and have full confidence my daughter is in competent and compassionate hands.< /Text>

My three-year-old kid loves going to see Dr Naj! She even insisted on drawing her a pic. Going to the dentist is a very positive experience for my kid, half because I have prepared her and we play dentist at home and half because the office is so cute and the team is wonderful. Everyone is so gentle and patient and know how to make the experience fun.  I’ve referred all my friends and family to the office, too.  Thank you Little Star!</review>

We had an amazing tongue and lip tie release experience with Little Star Pediatric. They were so prompt with our appointment time, thorough with describing the pro and cons to doing the procedure, and the procedure only took about 5 minutes. Since we went during Covid procedures, they encouraged me to have my husband on the phone to hear the options since he couldn't come into the appointment. The follow up appointments take less than 15 minutes and the doctor is amazing about checking in on all aspects for the tie releases. Thank you guys so much, we will be back when our baby has teeth to clean!<//review>

We’ve been coming here since my youngest (who is now 3) had his posterior tie treated. I had no intention of staying for routine dental care, but after such a positive experience, I felt I’d be making a poor decision if I didn’t. It’s now been over 3 years, and every time we come in, I’m blown away by the kindness and warmth of everyone in the office! I love that my boys are EXCITED to see the dentist.</text>

As first time parents I think we would have appreciated a bit more consultation and the appointments feeling a little less rushed. Due to Covid, both parents aren’t allowed in which is very unfortunate to have to make such big decisions over the phone.<//Review></record>

<text>Dr Najmeh and the staff at Little star have been amazing over the past 1.5 years we have been seeing them. They are always kind and comforting to my children with sensory processing disorder and make sure to assuage any concerns I have. We’ve had lip/tongue tie revisions, fillings under sedation as well as routine dental exams and have been more than pleased with every interaction. Dr Najmeh does a wonderful job of balancing information and conversation with the parent/guardian while engaging and involving the child. We can’t recommend them enough!

The office staff has also been great! They return calls promptly, schedule us in quickly if there is a concern and go out of there way to provide all ingredients of any product they use on our severe allergy kiddo.</text>< Pics>

Little Star is the place to go for tongue tie revisions! We have kaiser and they use scissors. We went to Little Star to get a second opinion and decided to move forward. Little Star uses a laser and their care is exceptional. The staff are warm, comforting in stressful situation,  and Dr Naj is amazing! The procedure is quick and the entire team communicates clearly and made me feel comforted in their expertise. If you have an infant with tongue tie issues, come here first!</text>

<review>extremely  grateful for the Little Star Pediatric Dentist employees! They were very patient with my two wild toddlers. They spoke to them in a clan kind respect tone without the whole visit. I can’t thank them enough for everything they did and had to deal with! Thank you thank you thank you.

As for the cleanliness and protocols for Covid. They followed all guidelines and went beyond to make sure each patient was secure and safe in their environment.< /review>< pics>

Great children's dentist. Check in was fast and easy (we were the 1st appointment of the day). All of the staff who we interacted with was very friendly. It was my son's 1st dental appointment and they were very sweet with him. The doctor was also very nice and informative. We will definitely be going back!<//text>

<Text>My kids actually look forward to seeing Dr Najmeh. I never would have expected any kid to like the dentist, much less kids with oral defensiveness and SPD. When I told my 5 year old about our appointment this week, he said “YESSSSS!!” Then, I overheard my 8 year old during share time in (virtual) school this morning, telling their class about what a great time they’d had at the dentist yesterday! I wish she could be my dentist, too.<//Text>< Pictures>

Love Dr. N ... she’s extremely sweet and helpful. So many kind staff members here. One star missing bc the policies are a bit strict for check in and cancellations, and a particular staff member at check in seems a bit up tight (trying not to be rudely specific), and that’s a little unpleasant. Anyway, overall an excellent pediatric dentist and a nice facility. Truly 4.5 stars.<//Review>

<Text>I first brought my son to Dr. Najmeh to evaluate his tongue tie as he had been having some breathing/airway issues. We were looking at putting him under GA for a procedure and I wanted to rule out the tongue tie before doing so.

Dr. Najmeh was so kind and knowledgeable. She took ample time to listen to our story and addressed all of my questions and concerns. In the end we were able to conclude that he didn’t need a frenectomy and I felt much more at ease about moving forward with our other recommended procedure.

After the first time we saw her I knew that she was the only dentist I would trust to handle my child’s regular dental care. Tanisha at the front desk is always so kind and very thorough in regards to my insurance coverage. The assistant’s who help in handling his dental care are so warm, patient, and caring. Dr. Najmeh’s knowledge, skill, caring and fun personality are the perfect combination for a children’s dentist. I recommend her to everyone that I can!<//Text>< Pics>

Compassionate honest dentistry. Dr. H's heart is truly in the right place. She released my 9yo tongue tie with such patience and kindness. She is also not quick to fill a tooth that's going to fall out soon.< /Review>

< Review>
This is just my own personal opinion based on my 4 year-old's experience.  I went in and was told he had 8 cavities and would need to be under anesthesia to have them taken care of.  The other option was to avoid the anesthesia and have it all done while awake - they did not recommend this option.  But anesthesia would cost $1,250 and was ineligible for any type of insurance including PPO.  So I asked if we could break the anesthesia-free procedures into fewer sessions in order to make it more bearable - they were unhappy with this. I've been asking for them to call me back about this possibility for months and haven't heard any response or reason as to why they can't.<//Review>

Amazing office! The staff and Dr. Najmeh are nothing but amazing! My son came here to get his tongue and lip ties revised and it has truly saved our breastfeeding journey. My sons ties healed beautifully with help of Dr. Najmeh thoroughly explaining and demonstrating the proper after care and stretches for a successful recovery. The office made me feel confident in my choice and displayed amazing customer service, I highly recommend!!<//text>

<Text>Our son had a Lip and Tongue tie surgery at four months. Since our experience with all other support providers in his early months didn’t catch both, I sought out more answers as to why we were having such a hard time. Our laser treatment went quickly, professionally, and with compassion from the doctor and staff alike. From that day forward, my advice to first time moms is to go to THIS SPECIFIC dentist in the first week of life. The facilities are brightly decorated with Star and sky decor, done tastefully, has TVs in the ceiling for kids, and is incredibly CLEAN. I plan to return when we have our second baby for an opinion. She is one of the only doctors I have fully trusted in this first year of life. Educated, common sense, fair, truthful, and PASSIONATE about assisting babies with ties. Grateful for this office and what it did for our son.<//Text><time>1574697883389</time><user_id>115828153692038106556</user_id></record>

<review>We love Little Star and have been bringing our son since he was born! He had a lip and tongue tie released with them too and the follow up, after care instructions and appointments were very thorough. I would recommend little Star to everyone< /review>< gmapID>

<Response>{'time': 1591296362657, 'text': "Unfortunately your review is inaccurate and plainly untrue. Firstly, you never met or talked with me (Dr. Najmeh). If you are truly in the dental field, you know that all offices are limiting visits to scheduled patients and a single parent at this time, due to COVID-19 recommendations, and safety precautions that go in line with that. You were given those recommendations prior to scheduling, and agreed. You brought an additional, unscheduled child, to the appointment and we simply can not let another child in at this time. We are looking out for the safety of all of our own patients and staff. Again, if you were in the dental profession, this would be something you should already know. It's okay if you misunderstood and we were willing to reschedule, but you started making threats about leaving negative reviews and at that point, we can no longer allow you to be a part of the practice. We have our patients best interest at heart and patients making threats don't go well with us. Additionally, frenectomy procedures do not cost $1,400 at this office. Especially for people who have insurance. That is a flat out lie. We don't appreciate you spreading inaccuracies. We wish you the best of luck in the future, wherever that may be."}</Response><rate>1</rate><Pics>None<//Pics>< name>

<Review>Extremely rude and inconsiderate DDS. If you are driving in from out of town, I would recommend just finding a local dentist who will lovingly care for the needs of your little one. I drove up 2 hours to bring my NB in for a  lip-tie revision, only to be told I had to reschedule.

They stated adamantly that the “rules you read and agreed to state nobody could come with the patient other than one parent”. I had missed that unfortunately, and my 4 year old was with me as I had no one to leave him with. They refused to let him sit in reception and said he would be a liability.

They also charge their patients for PPE which should come out of the dentists’ pocket (especially if you are paying $1400 for a 5-10 minute procedure!).

Worse experience I have had with a dentist, and I have worked in this field for over 10 years...< /Review>< UserId.>

I am a new mom and this was our 1st visit to the dentist for my lil man. So far they check all the boxes. Easy to get a hold of and return call pretty fast. Easy to get an appointment. Nice website. Nice location. Very nice staff. Easy to understand when they talk. Explained everything clearly. No pressure to get lip tie done. Provided me all the facts so I could make the decision. They come highly recommended by other moms that have been there before. I look forward to continuing to bring my son there.< /review>

The office staff is kind and helpful- went out of their way to tell me the best way to deal with my insurance. Follow up was also amazing. I loved that Dr. Hannanvash does multiple follow up appointments to ensure the release heals properly.

Little Star is amazing. They make the experience fun and easy going for my son. We have been going to them since his first tooth came in. They took care of his lip tie as well. State of the art office. They dont pressure and up sale. They dont talk over you. Always a great experience. They even have a great system for covid times that keeps you still feeling welcomed. I always recommend them. If they saw adults I would go to them too.< /text>

We had a fantastic experience with Dr. Hannanvash and her staff.  My 8 year old daughter was referred to Little Star for a potential tongue and lip revision procedure.  I loved the fact that Dr. Hannanvash was able to evaluate her and perform the procedure on the same day.  She and her staff displayed love and care for my daughter, and took the time to explain everything to me, including post-procedure care.  The office is also beautiful and decorated perfectly for children (big and small!).<//Text>

I love Little Star!!! Dr Najmeh and her staff are the best! I took my 2 yr old in for an emergency exam due to an accidental fall causing his gums to bleed. I panicked and first thing I thought was  Oh Great! His teeth are loose! So I automatically thought to contact Little Star to schedule an appointment. The front staff are always super friendly over the phone and the scheduling process is so easy and smooth. They were nice enough to give me some advice to care for the injury meanwhile we waited for our appointment the following day.  Our assistant Michelle took us in and did a fantastic job with taking xrays which I greatly appreciate the patience she showed with my little one as he is a bit uncooperative sometimes. Dr Naj came in right away and took a look for any fractures or loose teeth. I honestly don’t know how she was able to do that so calmly and easily since I struggled at home! She’s awesome.. Luckily no fractures or chipped teeth! She then gave me home care instructions and told us to come back in a few months to make sure everything looks healed and well. At the end we got some fun stickers and a goodie bag with a new toothbrush and other daily oral care items. Overall our experience was great and we will definitely be returning!</Text>

<Time>1591370932011</Time><rating>5<//rating><review>Best dentist and best dental office of all time. I have gone to several offices over the years and Dr. Najmeh is the absolute kindest and most considerate professional person my family has encountered. After having a couple of rather poor experiences with my son't tongue release with Kaiser, we were advised to go to Little Star. Dr. Najmeh could tell that I was a defeated mom and she was so reassuring that she could help us. The entire experience was night and day different from what we experienced before. Now my son can latch better and actually fill his stomach and not stay hungry. She did it correct where two other doctors had not. I highly recommend going here first and not wasting time with other more incompetent doctors. We liked our experience at Little Star so much that we transferred the care of all of our children here. And that did not disappoint! They loved the process and especially loved getting to watch TV while their teeth were being cleaned. This is an office and a doctor I would recommend without hesitation and we will be here for as long as possible! Thank you Dr. Najmeh and staff.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

He had a tongue tie and every other option was done or off the table at this point and my son was not gaining weight as rapidly as the pediatrician said was necessary for proper growth and keeping up my milk supply. Wow! did we have a great experience. The laser procedure was quick and efficient. My husband and I were terrified to go through this again because our first son's tongue tie was done through the insurance and they had to cut underneath his tongue. The procedure got a bit bloody and was pretty hard on our 3 week old. So when we were referred to Little Star we we're super bummed out we had to go through this again, but I can honestly say everything from the staff to the procedure and follow-up was awesome!< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>We had a wonderful experience at Little Star. The office is so bright and welcoming. There are lots of nice details including their welcome to 'the newest starts'. We were there for my sons lip and tongue tie revision and they made the process smooth, easy, and painless. Dr. Najmeh explained the process carefully and confirmed the lip and tongue tie. I didn't want to do it right away and there was no pressure to do so- in fact she said I could wait until I was ready. The process itself was a little tough to handle but they were so quick and so kind. I am so glad we were referred to them for the procedure and would recommend anyone to the practice. If we were closer I'd bring both my kiddos there for regular dental check ups!< /Text>< gmap_id>

We’ve been with little star pediatric dentistry for a year now. What started out as having my infants tongue and lip tie fixed turned into them being our permanent dentist for our sweet boy. The atmosphere is great and so fun for the kids. It’s a clean place with friendly staff. We’re forever grateful for the staff at little star pediatric dentistry!</text>

<text>We couldn’t be happier with our experience at Little Star. When we meet Dr. Najmeh I was a bundle of stress. I was triple feeding my six week old daughter and getting zero sleep. Dr. Najmeh diagnosed her posterior tongue tie and lip tie and offered to revise it right then. We opted to do some craniosacral therapy and meet with an IBCLC prior to the revision and scheduled the appointment for two weeks later. The procedure was so fast and the healing process has been as easy as you could expect. My daughter instantly latched better and started transferring enough milk in a matter of days. It can be scary thinking about your little babe having a procedure at such a young age, but it is the sole reason we are able to continue breastfeeding and I am forever grateful.< /text>< pics>

Very friendly environment. The dentist is very nice and detailed. Except the first time when we got there and asked questions, we were told straight up that we should have read what was on the website. I just thought that out of courtesy, questions can be answered at the place instead of telling the customers to go back and read as if they were going to school. I don’t think that when you have a newborn, you’d have a ton of free time to do whatever you want to do.</Text>

<text>Dr. Najmeh Hannanvash and her staff are  amazing. They are always friendly and polite.  Dr. Najmeh Hannanvash took care of my 6 week old daughter’s tongue and lip tie. She was very thorough with her examination, and the information she provided in order for me to make an informed decision on whether or not to have the correction done. She even showed me what exactly need to be corrected, Once I made the decision she made sure to go over every possible detail from what’s going to happen that day, what I would need to do  and what to expect in the following days. She made she sure I had a video to do the stretches to insure my daughter heeled properly.  I felt very comfortable and confident in Dr. Najmeh Hannanvash preforming the procedure. I very happy with our all around experience, and can not thank her an her staff enough for helping my little one!</text><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>From the time I called Little Star to inquire about tie revision for my 2 week-old son, I was so impressed with Dr. Najmeh and her team. The office staff was so friendly and I was able to schedule a consult within 2 days of my initial call.

Dr. Najmeh was so patient answering my questions (& I had lots since I was entrusting her to take care of my newborn). She engaged with me and validated my concerns. She took her time showing me how to do the stretches (which I was very nervous about).

I appreciated that there was time to do the revisions that day, but there was no pressure. I decided to do it that same day because I felt so comfortable with her and her expertise in doing the procedure.

Dr. Najmeh was so good about taking my son into another room for the procedure. She had a clam demeanor and explained exactly what would happen and that they’d have him back in my arms as soon as possible-and they did! He wasn’t even gone 5 minutes (or at least that’s what it felt like).

I can’t say enough good about Dr. Najmeh and her team. I would highly recommend Little Star.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

After the frenectomy, I immediately felt a difference in her latch. The procedure was not a quick fix, we still had to work on technique,  but it was a game changer and made the process much easier!

All of the staff we encountered were great!

I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone because it means you and your little one are having trouble, but if you’re going to go through this experience, go through it with Dr. Hannanvash at Little Star Pediatric Dentistry.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

We were referred by our Lactation consultant after finding out our 4mo had lip and tongue tie.
Dr. Najmeh was very kind and patiently answered all of our questions. She explained the details of the frenectomy and aftercare stretches, and even suggested we record them on our phone. We decided to release both ties on the same day- Best decision ever!
It was hard seeing our baby in pain but the procedure didn’t took longer than 5 minutes and I immediately noticed an improvement while nursing.
We had subsequent follow ups to make sure everything was properly healing and Dr. Najmeh and her staff were amazing..very helpful and caring🤗
I highly recommed LS, they will definitely exceed your expectations ⭐️<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I found out about Dr. Najmeh through the Badass Breastfeeders of San Diego. Yesterday was my daughter's first ever dental appointment and I would say it was a successful visit. For reference, my daughter is 16 months old. Totally worth the one hour drive. I am a resident of South Bay San Diego and drove through morning rush hour traffic just to have my daughter seen by Dr. Najmeh. Very clean office. Warm, welcoming ambience. The staff were all very friendly and professional. The dental assistant working with us noticed that my daughter was pulling at my shirt and wanted to comfort nurse. The dental assistant was the one who told me I could go ahead and nurse her while we discussed my daughter's history.

I wish I had known about Little Star before my daughter was born. I didn't find out this Pediatric specific dental practitioner until my daughter was two months old (too late to add her onto my dental insurance). My daughter was diagnosed with a Posterior tongue tie which I had revised through Rady's, due to insurance purposes. If I could go back in time, I would have added dental coverage for my daughter right after she was born so that I would have been able to have her evaluated by Dr. Najmeh instead. Dr. Najmeh noted some slight reattachment of my daughter's tongue tie and a slight lip tie. She explained what needed to be done in the future but didn't push for anything to be done since my daughter is not currently having any issues.

I will definitely be sticking with Little Star Pediatric Dentistry for all of my daughter's dental needs.<//Review>< pics>

Had a wonderful experience at little start pediatrics. Our daughter was both tongue and lip tied and Dr. Hannanvash was amazing and did a wonderful job. I really enjoyed having the weekly check ups to ensure it was healing correctly. Dr. Hannanvash was extremely informational and answered all questions that was asked. She made the experience better as I was worried about the surgery. It ended up being quick and exactly how she explained. The front office staff was very friendly and nice. The experience was wonderful in all aspects.< /review>

Both of my girls had their tongue and lip ties revised by Dr. Hannanvash, and she is great! Both of our baby girls, revised 2 years apart, had great outcomes and no more breastfeeding issues! I'd choose her again and again for this procedure.</Review>

<text>I received a consult from a lactation consultant shortly after discovering my newborn had tongue and lip ties, and I am SO VERY HAPPY I was referred to Little Star!

Everyone was highly professional, compassionate, & well-coordinated! Scheduling a consult was quick & painless, and the online services are OUTSTANDING! Most importantly, everyone is GREAT with the kiddos.

The office is the cleanest most kid-friendly I have ever seen! From the waiting room to the patient care rooms, and even down to the business & appointment reminder cards - everything was perfect!

Dr. Hannanvash is AMAZING! She broke everything down for me play-by-play, making sure I understood the procedure and especially aftercare. Her guidance made the recovery process for my newborn’s lip and tongue tie releases completely stress-free.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<username>Andrew Ross</username><response>None<//response><review>Dr. Najmeh was very kind and laid out the facts for us and didn't pressure us to make a decision right away. We felt they took very good care of our daughter. We decided to have her tongue and lip tie revised (lasered). The procudure was less than 5 minutes and there was very little bleeding. We're still having some latching issues but believe that is behavioral at this point and are working with a lactation consultant. This was a much better experience than the tongue tie procedure we did previously with my son that simply snipped under his tongue rather than lasering. The healing was much faster and there was no bleeding. We would definitely recommend Little Star Dentistry.<//review>< GmapID>

Dr Najmeh was highly recommended by both our pediatrician and lactation consultant and did not disappoint.  She has treated both my son and daughter for lip and tongue ties.  Both kids achieved a much stronger latch after treatment.  Dr Najmeh did a fantastic job and I also now recommend her to friends and family.<//text>

<Text>Dr. Najmeh Hannavash came highly recommended and I can see why. She’s organized, efficient, and clear in her communication and service. It’s easy to trust her expertise. And the office is bright and cheerful in both customer service and appearance. Receiving care from Little Star Pediatrics has been a breeze. 2 weeks after a tongue and lip-tie release, our little one is feeling SO much better. He was experiencing acid reflux, gas pains, and tension in his body. The tension has almost completely gone, he’s experiencing less gas (even without burping) and his acid reflux bothers him maybe once every two days, instead of all day and all night. We’re very grateful for Dr. Najmeh Hannavash‘s service and how affordable she made it for our family.< /Text>< pics>

The follow-up experience for the tongue tie procedure was outstanding. I was angry that I had to wait until 2 months old to get the procedure done due to my insurance (Tricare), but it ended up being OK because of Dr. Najmeh's confidence and proficiency in dealing with babies. I'm excited to work with her when my baby has teeth!< /Review>

<review>Dr. Naj and the entire Little Star staff are awesome! The office is so clean and fun for kids, and Dr. Naj is a complete pro in laser revisions. We trusted her 100% with our toddler's lip-tie revision. Even though our toddler had to have novocaine without being able to understand why, she came out smiling after the procedure and has had no pain. I'd highly recommend this practice.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>The doctor was amazing but the front desk girl was awful!!!! Our baby had a lip and tongue tie that we had lasered the same day as our consultation. We had to pay upfront and then submit the receipt and forms to insurance to get reimbursed. Once we did that we received a partial check in the mail. Our health insurance said that if we had Little Star pediatric dentistry provide a modifier 25 (which is just something that shows that the consultation is separate from the actual procedure) that they could also reimburse us in full for the consultation. When I called Little star pediatric dentistry the front desk woman that answered the phone was extremely rude and condescending. She kept talking to me like I had no idea what I was talking about, and said that she would contact our insurance. She asked for the claim number, and the phone number. Then called me back later to say that she talked to a gentleman with our insurance company and that he said he had no idea what I was talking about either. I called our insurance again yesterday, and they said that they notate every conversation with anyone regarding a claim and that she had never called and then offered to call little star pediatric dentistry for me. She never got a hold of them and said that they were not answering their phones, and said that she had just added the modifier 25 in for us since we had such a difficult time with little star pediatric dentistry. The procedure went well and our baby healed perfectly, but I would definitely never recommend little star pediatric dentistry because of our experience with the woman upfront. Never expected someone that is supposed to be helpful and honest to be so blatantly rude and dishonest.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf83cedf0f1e9:0x635aa0e2e3318e29< /gmap_id></record>

I recently had the adult tongue tie release (Frenectomy). I was very pleased with the outcome and with the care and instruction I received from Dr. Hannanvash. She is straight forward, knowledgeable, and very comfortable. Everything went great and I am fully recovered 2 weeks after the procedure. I would definitely recommend Dr. Hannanvash and her friendly staff for any dental and oral procedures.<//text>

<Review>Absolutely LOVE Little Star Pediatric dentistry! We come all the way from Chula Vista to see Dr.Najmeh and it is so worth it! She and her staff have always made it such a painless experience to take my son to the Dentist and always have us in and out efficiently! I would recommend anyone to choose Little Star, especially if they are worried about certain procedures, your child will be in good hands here! I was very nervous about the lip and tongue tie revision procedure but after having it done here I have nothing but good things to say! The procedure itself was quick and my son had little pain (nothing unmanageable) and the check ups were thorough and since then he has flourished greatly! Dr.Najmeh has always made me feel comfortable in her office and I could not ask for more as a first time parent wondering if I'm doing things "right"! We love Little Star!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dbf83cedf0f1e9:0x635aa0e2e3318e29</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Choosing Dr. Najmeh was a great decision for our family. Our 1 month old daughter needed a tongue and lip tie lasered and we went with little star dentistry.

In a stressful situation for a new mom, Dr. Najmeh was calming,  educational and reassuring. The procedure was quick and I felt comfortable with  them workong on my baby.

Scheduling was easy and convenient,  the staff was kind,  we will definitely come back when we start to have teeth.<//Review>

We had a great experience with Little Star Pediatric Dentistry. Dr. Najmeh is wonderful, and her nurses and staff were great as well. Having any procedure done on an infant can be scary, but the doctor made us feel assured, informed, and respected. We were seen promptly for all of our appointments, and it was clear that Dr. Najmeh is passionate about her work, and truly cares about each of her patients. The insurance procedure (which is tricky, but by no fault of the dental office) was explained to us clearly, and we were provided with all needed information to submit to our insurance. I would recommend this practice, especially for frenectomies, but also for any other pediatric dental care as well.< /Review>

Dr. Nahjmeh is AMAZING! A pediatrician "clipped" my sons tongue tie when he was born. He still couldnt latch and it was just problem after problem. Finally at 3 months I took him to Dr. Nahjmeh, my son had a lip tie and the tongue tie wasnt completely clipped. I am happy to say my son latches like a champion now! I cannot thank her enough she is amazing!!!!!!< /Review>

<review>This review is based on my experience with the Dentist, her staff, and the Office Manager. I will start with the positive part, which was my interactions with the DR. alone was very positive. I was not impressed or care for her staff. They all seemed like and gave the impression of not knowing their role in the office or how things operated. For example, I asked the nurse if I could stay in the room to nurse after seeing the doctor and she fumbled with her words and then ended with "I am new so I am not sure." This was a common statement I received more than once from multiple individuals. Also the statement "We just opened so there is a lot going on" is another common statement I received. She was recommended by my lactation consultant for my 3 month olds tongue tie and lip tie. I wanted to get this issue fixed ASAP, but because they were moving offices they could not see my daughter until a week out from when I was calling because I was seeking for my insurance to cover the procedure and visit. I called ahead of time asking for specific charges. It was explained to me by the office manager at the time that "it would be covered, unless I came in this week (to the old office) and you will have to pay out of pocket." I did not want to pay 650$ for this when I have insurance that would cover it. I did have a pediatrician and an ENT office that would cover the procedure, not even a co-pay. I went to her because she was recommended and they confirmed on the phone before I was in the office that I had insurance and yes it would be covered 100%. The day of the procedure came and it was not until after the procedure that it was brought to my attention that my daughter was not covered and I would have to pay out of pocket and submit a "superbill." I did not appreciate this, but they assured me I would be reimbursed. This all occurred the last week of March, it is now June. I only received a small partial reimbursement from my insurance and was explained by them that they should not have charged me that much and I was to get the rest from the office. I had faith that this office would stand by their word and good name to give me back my money they said would be reimbursed. I have now spoken with the Dr. herself and the new office manager and they have both said they will not give me my money back because "someone has to pay for the labor and procedure that was done." They admitted they were in the wrong and it should have been handled differently, but still will not reimburse me. This is just one of my issues with this office. This is very unprofessional! When opening a business you need to have staff and things aligned before taking ones money. I am very upset with this type of business. Also, on one of my follow-up visits I had to wait over an hour when asking about my daughter situation and was told she will see me. It wasn't till over an hr of waiting with a 3 month old in an office that she was too busy and could not see me by her staff. Rude. Now, this is all on her ways of handling business, as for her procedures. I have yet to see any problems with what was altered in my child's mouth. I have to say she did a good job and I feel it was the best route to take when having this done. She did not seem to be in pain, which was my personal goal with her. I really wish I could say I would come back here and recommend her to others, but I do not and will not for the purpose that I am still out 400$ of my own money when I have insurance that could have covered this. I just wish they would own their wrong and reimburse me at least most of my money.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful Dr. Nahjmeh and her staff are! First of all, she has the friendliest staff I have ever encountered in a medical office. The receptionist Tenisha is so sweet and happy from phone call to visit. The hygienist who did the cleaning was such a sweetheart to my 4yo son, I wish Remembered her name! Dr. Najmeh is kind and very easy to talk to. She is knowledgeable, and so patient with my spirited kiddo. They spoke directly to him and were so kind even when he was uncooperative! They played his favorite movie, Toy Story, which he can watch while he gets his cleaning! And then he got a cool bag of “treats”! I’m so jealous! Fun stickers and sunglasses and a mickey toothbrush! How did they know we love Mickey? She also performed a Frenectomy on my 10mo baby and he is doing AMAZING! She is so so sweet and took great care of him...he didn’t even cry. I’m so grateful that I found this place. Dr. Najmeh is such a pro. This place is a dream! Tv’s on the ceiling, you guys! It’s clean, it’s fun, it’s PEACEFUL!! I drive all the way from Hemet...it’s worth every mile!  Go go go! I wish she was my dentist!< /Text>

My friend recommended me this coffee shop. So, I went here yesterday to have coffee and my breakfast, too. By the appearance of the place, it gave me happiness and comfort. When I drank their coffee, it was very yummy, like I forgot all my problems. So if you are stressed or need to take a break, go to this coffee shop!</text>

You can use Postmates, order to go, or tempt yourself to go there. (Good luck with that one!). Really a great place.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Good espresso, and great pour over... very commercialized felt almost like a Starbucks and not to much as a roaster but still great coffee... service was great and helpful in recommendations< /Text>

<review>Best coffee I've ever had!!!  This place is so good!  I really wish I didn't have to drive from OC area and also only see them as Asian night markets.  Please make a store in the OC area!!!  This place is so good, every thing I've gotten tastes delicious!  There's always a long line but they go really fast.<//review>< pics>

<text>I arrived early to the apartment i was supposed to be renting for the weekend and needed to kill some time. Cuties coffee was there right by the corner and the vibe of the place caught my fancy. The place is branded and made to make people from all types and genders feel comfortable in an inclusive place (LGBTQ Friendly). The coffee shop is just that. Don't expect fanciness or comfort here but expect a place where you can just sit down to some really cool music (can't emphasise this more!) and watch people from different walks of life walk in and relax. It is a place where you can make great conversations and read interesting books (The choice of books matched my taste exactly and got my hooked)<//text>< gmapID>

<Response>None</Response><review>The staff is always super friendly, and the coffee is nothing short of heavenly. Yummy breakfast food to start the day, too!

Parking is a breeze in the neighborhood surrounding Larchmont

The only minor negative for this spot is that power outlets are pretty scarce, so make sure your all charged up!< /review>< Pics>

Love this shop. Every time I go the coffee is great, espresso on-point, baristas are cool and kind, and the environment feels fun, queer, and community oriented. Good seating, pricing is decent, and plenty of cool art to look at on their walls.</Text>

I adore coming to this coffee shop. They're so friendly here and their drinks are AMAZING. Lots of vegan options here too. It's a small place, but they have made great use of this space - seating inside and outside, and a little loft with even more places to chill, study, or catch up with a friend. Outlets galore on the top level if you need to recharge or use your laptop. An absolute gem, just like the folks who run it.< /text>

Cutie's Coffee is an invaluable resource for the queer community, allowing for queer gathering for those who are sober, under 21 or just not into clubbing/bars. Besides having the best coffee and tea, Cutie's boasts frequent events and pop ups, a LGBTQ focused library inside and a corkboard full of queer resources. If you are looking for your new favorite coffee shop hangout, this is IT.< /Text>

My writeup reflects the positive experience that I encountered at Cuties on our interview date.

Having an endless amount of support is what independent businesses thrive on, and West Hollywood’s LGBTQ-focused shop Cuties Coffee not only thrives on the support of others, but also lends it back to those who may need a little bit of an extra boost in their life. Store owners Virginia Bauman and Iris Bainum-Houle opened Cuties with a goal of creating a much-needed safe space for the local queer community, and that goal is very much apparent from the design of the shop to the events they hold there. From the minute you step in you are instantly welcomed by a sweet as pie barista, the delicious aroma of freshly roasted coffee, and peppy pop music to match the store’s bright pastel color scheme to lift your spirits all the while making you feel at home. Locals and Patreon supporters aid in providing some “Extra Love” to benefit from the amazing things that Cuties can provide from a simple spare cup of coffee (also known as Suspended Coffee) to being able to keep the shop afloat.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Not only are the coffee and noms delish, you can feel the love for the community infused into every inch of the space. If you’re local you have to visit! It’s a fantastic spot for LGBTQ+ folks of all ages to come and schmooze away from bars. If you’re not in LA tell your friends who are to support this amazing LGBTQ+ coffee shop!

As the namesake, it is so cute here. They have really good coffee, too. I tried Intelligista or whatever the hyped up coffee bar is around here, and I like the coffee and employees at Cuties way better so I will continue to come here for my morning coffee</review>

Cuties is my favourite coffee shop in all of LA! They have super yummy food and drinks, welcoming staff, and they host wonderful inclusive events. There's also free parking in the neighbourhood and metered parking right out front.

For those still playing Pokémon Go, grab a hot chocolate and spin all the pokestops in range! There's a bunch.<//review>

While the food I did manage to get at Cuties was pretty good, and I really enjoyed the tea, the space was far from accessible. From a lack of anything comfortable amongst the sparse seating available to overly loud music, my time in the shop was a physical nightmare and left me incredibly overwhelmed. I also had a moment where a server asked me to move out of the way in the incredibly packed space with some impatience that I wasn’t able to magic the people boxing me in out of existence and then turning to my femme partner and being very kind by comparison about the same situation which left me feeling mistreated for my butchness. I eventually made my way across the street to the The Faculty, a bar with much better atmosphere and more reasonable prices, where I was treated very well by the serving staff that seemed happy to have our business. They also had comfortable booths.<//review>

<review>Cuties is a miracle. I love this place so much. The coffee is excellent and the employees and customers are folks i want to be around. Cuties does the best programming- with film screenings, talks, mixers, amd workshops. LGBTQIA-fabulous. Please come here,and often. We need more places like Cuties in LA.</review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c75999f9b28d:0x996b2321e4b05836</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amazing, so happy this exists. If your queer idgaf how far you have to travel this is a blessing. Come get a coffee or just enjoy the non-conforming atmosphere. Also, get on their mail list for heaps of queer/trans safe spaces, meetups, and general info for activities around LA.</Review>

< Review>
The best coffee around this area, this what Virgil Village used to feel like, from the moment I walked in I could feel the good energy pouring into my soul.

The place is spacious  and is about 3 blocks from Squrl and 1 block west of the fault line. The people who work here are welcoming without being overbearing.

There are vegan options.

There is lots of  parking on Melrose Ave. and some metered parking on Heliotrope.

It is also easily accessible if you are using  the Los Angeles Metro, system, one could easily come here for coffee and take the Melrose bus down to West Hollywood. For those of you who are using AirBnb to stay in East Hollywood, Silver Lake or Los Feliz you can start here and make your way west towards Beverly Hills or East to Downtown Los Angeles or north to the Griffith Park Observatory. The Los Angeles Metro Subway station is 2 blocks north. Easy access to the DASH. A good tip when traveling using the Metro is to buy the day pass for $7.00 which allows the rider to ride all day.

If you are looking for great coffee in the beating heart of Virgil Village in Los Angeles, this is the place you must try.< /Review>

<Text>What a phenomenal space to be in! Every time I pop in I feel oh so welcome by the badass staff that has molded this environment to be what it is... supportive of us diverse queer/trans folx and able to  promote LA events and workshops curtailed to our needs/wants/desires of both community safety and fun .  I can only mention great things about this place;I really appreciate their newsletters and honor their journey, time and labor to establish this coffee spot(It's of substantial value to visit and connect and experience !!!)As non-binary and black  this is my favorite spot to just be, exist unapologetically and sometimes eat (food) and sip(tea).  Stop by and see what I mean.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c75999f9b28d:0x996b2321e4b05836< /GmapID></record>

<name>Jasmine Barker</name><review>The staff from start to finish is amazing! They are great with kids, very informative, don’t try to push unnecessary procedures & very patient and kind. The office is fun for kids & the staff all know how to handle and treat kiddos. We will be returning! We have dental insurance for another provider (western dental) but are willing to pay the extra for the phenomenal treatment from SCV Pediatrics!<//review>< user_id>

This is definitely the only dentist to go to for your child. They are patient, understanding and perfect with my daughter, who has a fear from her last dentist. Dr. Justin is amazing and is the perfect person to help my daughter through her fears. We absolutely love going here, and we wouldn’t go anywhere else.<//Review>

<review>Dr. Pair is the best orthodontist ever!!! I had bad experiences with previous orthodontists, and he helped fix the problem so well. He worked with me through migraine episodes, TMJ pain, and all sorts of other medical issues. He is so knowledgeable and incredibly kind. I would recommend him ten times over. If you need orthodontic work, go to him!!!<//review>< Pictures>

<review>From start to finish, my experience here was easy and very pleasant. We suspected our newborn had a tongue tie, due to a shallow and painful latch, and we were able to schedule an appointment very easily, even though we’d never been there before. Upon arriving, the support staff was warm and welcoming and so was Dr. Justin. They were all professional, knowledgeable and also wanted to make us feel welcomed and at ease— great bedside manner. Dr. Justin did our consultation and confirmed our baby had a posterior tongue tie and a slight lip tie. He took the time to talk through what the procedure to release the tie would be like, and also showed video of before, during and after the procedure of a child whose issue was similar to our child’s. My husband and I already knew that we wanted our child to have the procedure done if a tie was present, so once we agreed to it, the doctor was able to perform the procedure, same day, while we were there. It was a very quick procedure and all went well. Here’s the best part...I wasn’t able to nurse my baby immediately afterward because she was so drowsy, so I waited until I got home to try, and I kid you not, the nursing experience was like night and day!! Before, trying to nurse her was extremely painful to me and so frustrating for her as well. And almost like magic, an hour after the procedure was done, she latched without a problem, and I was in no pain whatsoever while nursing her. It‘s been about a week, so far, and still...no pain! Thank you Dr. Justin!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I highly recommend SCV pediatric dentistry. I happened upon them in a Google search looking for a specialist who performed lip tie/ tongue tie revisions. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they do the procedures and utilize the most current technology available. they were able to get us an appointment in less than 5 days for my 1 week old baby who had a class 4 tongue tie. Dr. Justin performed the procedure and thoroughly explained the preparation, procedure and aftercare directions to us. Dr. Justin called us that evening to check in to see how we were doing and if we had any questions. He and his staff were so caring and personable we decided to schedule our 3 year old for a check up with them. It was his 4th dentist visit but first time at SCV Pediatric Dentistry. I was worried as his visits to our old dentist were very traumatic for him. Right off the bat they made him feel comfortable by showing him around the office and making the check up fun for him. Dr. Justin took the time to go over our son's x-rays with both myself and my husband and answered all of our questions. Our son didn't cry at all and had so much fun! Dr. Justin also checked up on our baby to see how he was healing. If you are thinking of switching dental providers, go to Dr. Justin, you won't have any regrets!< /Review>< Response>

<text>Today was my first visit/consultation and it went really well! From calling and scheduling the appointment, to accidentally showing up 2.5 hours early and them accommodating me anyway; the front desk is efficient, helpful and incredibly kind! Dr. Pair was also very kind, thorough and easy to talk to. He was very informative and direct, so there won’t be any surprises down the line, while also setting real expectations. The waiting room was clean and large, so easy to manage distance during Covid restrictions. Very happy to have chosen Dr. Pair and his team for my ortho needs!</text>< Date>

I wish I had Dr. Justin as my dentist when I was a kid! I took my two little ones and I think I was more nervous that they were. Everyone made the whole experience super fun for the kids (I got a kick out of it too) and now the kids are asking when they can go back. If you are looking for a place for your little ones then this is the place to go.< /Review>

<review>I cannot say enough great things about this dentist. I have been taking my son (now 5.5 yrs old) and my daughter (now 8 years old) for over 3 years.  We have always had excellent experiences. Never long waiting periods, super super friendly staff both at the front desks and with the dentist and hygienists.  I’m surprised I haven’t already reviewed SCV Pediatric Dentistry.

What brought me to finally make a review though is the experience we had yesterday, Labor Day.  My son fell and lost one tooth in his fall and clearly messed up another tooth and we weren’t sure if there was more damage or not. We reached out and received a response from Doctor Justine almost immediately. He asked us to send video and pictures so he could take a look at severity. We did and within 20 minutes he contacted us back with a plan.
The plan was take my son in and get X-rays and definitely, unless the X-rays showed otherwise, to pull out the other tooth damaged in the fall. He had us meet him there in an hour so we got our things together and headed out.
When we got there, it being Labor Day, everything was closed up and Doctor Justine opened everything up for us and showed us in and comforted my son and walked through everything with us.

In walking in, I noticed he was wearing, being that he was not supposed to be working, a t-shirt that said, “Girl Dad.”

I made a comment that I liked the shirt, being that I’m also a dad of a daughter. And he made a remark of “well almost.” Which lead my wife and I to ask when is she due... he explained his wife was at the hospital having contractions at the same time. He brushed it off saying he had her blessing and the doctors as the contractions were very far a part. But our heart dropped. I always felt that Dr. Justine has a huge heart for his patients as it always showed, but to help care for my son while he has so much on his plate just blew us away and meant the world. He consistently comforted us to know that the exam and tooth pull would be quick and his wife was doing well and not to worry.

He was so good with our sons emergency and got everything taken care of and my son was a happy camper heading home to have the tooth fairy visit for his first time and for two teeth. Lol

I truly can’t say enough about Doctor Justine and the team at this pediatric dentist. They made have always made us feel so comfortable but yesterday Doctor Justine went above and beyond. With answering the call, responding quickly, all while it being Labor Day, and more so with a baby girl on the way.  Wishing Doctor Justine and his wife an amazing time getting to know there new baby and thank you for taking such good care of ours.

Can not recommend SCV Pediatric Dentistry more highly!!!</review><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<Review>Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful!! Both of my children have been through orthodontia here and we absolutely adore Dr.Pair and his entire staff! They are honest, give fair pricing, greet us with smiles and they genuinely feel like family. I feel that we have received the best orthodontic treatment possible at a reasonable price with excellent customer service. Dr.Pair and his staff are always very patient and explain all of the details when needed. They are available by phone for questions and advice and are very understanding and fair when complications arise. 10000% recommend them :)<//Review>< pics>

My 9 year old daughter loves coming to this office.  She's had her teeth cleaned, x-rays, fillings, extractions,  and sealants done and not once has she been uncomfortable.   I truly recommend this office for all pediatric dentistry needs.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Dr Pair came highly recommended by our dentist, we’ve been with our dentist for many years and completely trust her advice, so far no disappointments. Everyone is very nice and professional at Dr Pair’s office. We’ve just gotten started with the treatment but being a medical professional myself I look for providers that are honest, know what they are talking about and don’t want to overcharge their patients. Dr Pair has it all, plus he is also very nice. I am very willing to make the 1 hr drive to his office to get the expert care they provide.</Text></record>

Our family has been going to this office for about 6 years and we LOVE it! The staff is always friendly and helpful. My kids enjoy going to the dentist and I’m so grateful for that! Even through cavities, and x rays, everyone makes it easy and enjoyable. The kids love getting a new toothbrush and picking a prize each time they go. Thank you for everything!</text>

<review>I absolutely recommend Dr. Justin and everyone at SCV Pediatric Dentistry if you are looking for a dentist for your child. I have a very anxious kiddo and they have always been so patient with him. He has been going to them for 6 years now and has never said he is afraid of going or dreaded it. When he’s anxious it is only about what he is having done and never about the people he’ll be seeing or the office itself.

I am so grateful for everyone in the office and thank them so very much for all they do! I know that if you are reading this and thinking of taking your kiddo(s) there you will feel the same way.<//review>< Date>

<Date>1546915886696<//Date><Review>My kids have been going to SVC Pediatric Dentristry for the last 6 years.  I actually drive from Riverside because of the quality of care that my children receive from Dr. Dean and Dr. Justin.  My kids LOVE to go to the dentist.  They are rewarded for good brushing habits.  The doctors take time to meet with you after each visit and ask if you have any questions or concerns.  The office staff is amazing.  I highly recommend SVC Pediatric.< /Review><username>Donia Briones<//username><gmapID>0x80c28777f1128357:0x4261186522d663c9</gmapID>< UserId.>

Pizza Hut offered curbside no contact service. There was no curbside service, I had to wait in line & go to counter to get order.  The pizza was very dry.<//Review>

<Text>Subpar customer service and the wait time that they promise is not real. They will tell you 15 min but it's really like 30-45 min. The pizza is dry and not desirable. Their online prices very greatly from their instore prices and they refused to match them. They charge for crushed red pepper and parmesan cheese. Come on now! They used to have this delicious buttery crust, but my last two pizzas had dry, bland crust.
Go to Dominoes across the street if you are in the area.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Screwed up my order - I didn't realize until I'd got home. That's my problem, it seems.
Never returning.< /Text>

I have given this location 3 times to get my pizza right and I won't waste my time with them again. First time the pizza never came and when I called they say no one answered the door. This is funny cause I have a dog that barks at leaves falling! Second time I order a spinach pizza ( I know but I like my veggies) and it came without spinach so I called and explained my situation and the guy said...kid you not....the ran out of spinach. I said there is a Raplhs right across the street? Maybe I am dificult? The last time my pizza came cold and soggy after it was driven around for 45 minutes in the delivery car. I know because they have that stupid tracking system on line so I know the time it left the store. I am 5 mins away from the store, oh well.< /Text>

Unfortunately, this is the worst Pizza Hut experience EVER. If it wasn't for me being a true Pizza Hut fan- dealing with this location would turn me off.
10/3/17- 1st time ordering from this location, they delivered 3 cold pizza's and breadsticks. When I called to informed them I was told they'd credit half my order ($25).
11/3/17- 2nd time ordering from this location (forgot I even had a credit) ordered 3 pizzas for the kids, carry out this time to ensure freshness. I go to pick it up pizza wasn't ready was told they had to "recook" it. Apparently, that went the same for the 2 other customers who walked in with me. I, also g with the others, expressed frustratipand was told my order would be credit the full amount ($17.58)
11/11/17- apparently I was mis-informed. I can only was my credit at this location (smh). Call to place ordered and find out my credit was only for $16.
If I could, no stars would be given for this location.<//Text>

We were seated instantly. Got here at around 9am for breakfast. Our orders for drinks and food were taken almost as soon as we had decided. Food came in about 8min (yes I time those things) excellent. I had a machaca with eggs, rice & beans plate. It was perfect. After we had finished I forgot I had ordered flan. Asked for it and in a literal minute it was on my table. I cannot express how perfect the consistency of the flan was. I am a stickler for flan, too soft...you might as well call it a custard, too thick...you might as well call it a cake. I have no idea how people can fail at this but Mar y Tierra doesn't. Props.< /text>

<review>Honestly this restaurant has deteriorated severely over the past 10 years and has not been updated. The menu is the same and very overpriced for the quality. For those prices you're better off going to El Pescador or Gloria's. I regrettably ordered the breaded shrimp plate. This shrimp was over seasoned and greasy, the rice was bland, and the salad was soggy. Surprisingly the beans and flour tortillas were the only enjoyable parts of that meal. This restaurant needs to be gutted and rebuilt.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>Food is BOMB! We got the Mariscada fria and you can choose up to 4 tostada type. The ceviche de pescado is really good and the aguachiles too! All the waitresses were super nice! Hand made tortillas. Yummy!!. Really good Mexican food. The parking is the only bad thing, but it is worth the hassle.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c3337b0dced917:0xdc7213fa9c0e7dc< /gmapID></record>

Caldo de camaron is delicious. Quesadillas de carne asada are yummy and the asada plate is good too. Tortillas are hand made. 😋😋☺The waitresses are very polite as well.< /Text>

Food is fresh and really good. The only problem I have is their prices. They have raised prices on seafood  (mariscos) a lot. Even Menudo on Sundays has gone up a lot.
Used to be one of my favorites but it got expensive now.</Text>

Aura of dirty, and that I'm bothering them. How this place passed with the Health Inspector I'll never know. Hot AF inside while waiting for my food. Took me three tries to find a soda that wasn't pure carbonation, even the tea was watery 😭
Food was pretty good tbh. That's why I'm not giving them one star.<//review>

Good sized portions and little on the pricey side but you still get to have something that’s filling and delicious. Try the Thai chicken if you enjoy spicy and add in some gyozas too. Plus they have daily special combos.</text>< gmapID>

The food is pretty cheap for the large portions that they give and they have quite a few different options. They also have deals of the day that make the combo meals a even better price.

The management is very nice, friendly, and has never been rude to me on any of my visits. They even bring your plate out to you when it is ready so you don't have to get up.

I would definitely recommend going to this location, just be careful, this place is so good that it gave me a bit of a chubby belly, haha.<//Text>< pics>

<text>I ordered my food and when the it was cooking the lady “cook” went back to sit down  and kept chatting with the other employees while the food was cooking. The food is not good. Bland. Cold “Steam Veggies” watered down teriyaki sauce. I was so excited to eat there but I should of walked out when I seen nobody there. Like literally no clientele.

<text>Food is average at best. Calimari tasted bland even after u drench it with lemon juice (which they don't offer at the store) chicken is somewhat decent hence the 3 stars vs 1. Not do.ething u will ever crave but go to out of location convenience which u realize later is still not worth it . Will not be back</text>< pictures>

<text>Food is average not bad I'll go their in a pinch but I try to avoid this one because of the service the guy who works or possibly owns it is not a people person they need to keep him in the back cooking and away from the customers.

Pretty darn bad. Worst service and sub par food and small portions. Won't be back, even if I'm starving. Go next door. How can you mess up teriyaki (this place figured out a way). Avoid it.< /Text>

Rude customer service. Not sure if it's a language barrier but the older Asian gentleman Always acts as if you are bothering him by asking any questions about the food. Not sure if he is the owner or the cook but I decided to stay away from this place I can get the same type of food with much better service from the teenagers at the drive-through right down the street on Keifer Boulevard in Rosemont.<//Review>

Really bad experience, the moment I walked in a wasn't greeted. when I said I was ready to place my order I was completely ignored. even after I said excuse me a few times. the older lady looked at me and continued to clean the grill.. will never go back!< /review>

The reaturant was out dated and a little on the dirty side. The reatroom is located on the back side of the building and filthy. The menu offers simple choices for teriyaki but was so bad that after 3 bites went into trash. I tried the basic teriyaki and the chicken was rubber and the sauce was awful.  Will not recommend or repeat visting.< /text>< pictures>

My family and I love this place. The owners, Theresa and her chef husband, are awesome. Theresa hand rolls the won tons for their soup daily and everything is so fresh. If you have a favorite Asian dish and it's not on the menu, ask them!  99% of the time they will make it for you.

I'm was very excited to see that they are still open, especially during these hard times. I'm happy to drive out of the way to support this local business. Great location, friendly owners that know your name and what you want to order as soon as they see you walk in, and of course delicious food.< /Text>

Centrally located in downtown Martinez, the Canton Restaurant is quiet, cozy and the food and service is spot on. Food portions were generous. We visited on 10/15/19 and had the lunchtime specials. I had the Cashew Chicken and my guest had the Sweet and Sour Pork. My guest and I both commented on how savory the soup was. I was expecting the traditional tofu hot/sour soup; however the soup we were served was a bit different. It had small chunks of tomatoes in a savory tomato based stock along with small chunks of tofu and bean sprouts. It was very delicious and took the chill off the cool autumn afternoon. We both chose the pork chow mein instead of the fried rice.  The accompanying spring roll was perfectly crisp and fresh (but it would have been nice to have some sweet sour sauce to dip it in).  There was an abundance of cashews in the Cashew Chicken and the zucchini and sugar snap peas were fresh and crisp, not at all overcooked. We also had a pot of hot tea.

I recommend this restaurant for its food, service and ambience. My only regret is that we didn't sit in the window seat overlooking the street.</review>

I rode my motorcycle to Martinez recently on a random to see where the front wheel took me.

Finding myself starving and many businesses closed due to C19, I figured I would go back to Pleasant Hill where I started and go to Wendy's.

Canton in downtown MZ was open and I walked in and ordered Mongolian chicken to go (obv).  I got a small order of rice with it and walked out and ate the whole thing on the seat of my bike - using it as a makeshift table.

It was delicious and I didn't ride off needing more food.  $13 bucks very well spent.  I walked back in to thank the owners for taking the chance of being open.

Good ppl.  Give them a try.  BTW, piles of meat in my box.  Not the usu move of a few pieces of meat mixed into a farm of onions and bell peppers and what not.

I will be back!  Next time I will take a pic of the food and post.</text>

It's our favourite family restaurant.  We have 5 kids and they always love their food. Clean, fresh food to order. Their food is not greasy, we love to order the family meal. And we always go home with extra.< /Review>

Authentic, delicious food. Satiating servings; excellent specials.  Named after the old City of Canton, which is now Guangzhou, China, but this restaurant serves the finest pre-Mao plates.

Family-owned restaurant; they speak Cantonese,  if you want to practice.  Love them!  And the tea here is excellent!< /Review>

I came here more than 3 times, during about one year period. Really not very happy but last time the ingredients tasted very old. 2 people eat with me and everybody had same problem, so it is not me. The place was empty and did not smell like a restaurant. Did not smell like food at all. Kind of weird. Well, form your own opinion, don't just judge based on this.
I just arrived home and I threw away the food leftovers. It smelled weird and tasted funny. First time I give on star to a restaurant ever.< /text>

We both ordered the one person special ($9.95 each) and it all tasted burnt as if they used the same pan to cook it in with something burnt on the bottom. She said we can pay for our tea and soda and our soup (one was not eaten) and we paid $10 for just soup and two drinks.<//text>

A sleepy little town but, a very good Chinese restaurant.  Was surprisingly good.  The hot and sour was a bit different than ive had before.  The meat dish was very tender.  All the dishes had very good flavor.  We took Amtrak and walked over.  If your in town and need a quick, good, meal, then here you go.<//text>

🤢😷🤒👎👎👎👎👎First, walked in at noon and the place was empty and no aroma of anything being cooked. 👀 I told my sister we should leave but she insisted. We ordered a dinner for two which had some options. The cook was pulling stuff from a fridge that looked suspect and a deli counter. The sweet and sour pork was awful, the sauce was burnt. I literally had to spit it out.?the beef was chewy, we ate the won-ton soup and left the rest. 👎 No we do not want to box this up! 😒 We still paid full price and didn't complain.

This has to be the worse Chinese restaurant I've ever experienced before. I don't like to give businesses bad reviews but the food was terrible. The two people working there, they were nice but the food 🤢🤢🤢🤢< /Text>

Definitely the best Chinese in Martinez. They are welcoming and friendly, the food was delicious,  and it was done in the time it took to walk around the block catching Pokémon. The small carrying handles on the takeout boxes were a huge plus too, don't see those too often.</review>

Super crappy food. Not good, very greasy, the orange chicken tasted like 2 day old fried chicken that had been microwaved and then they poured orange sauce over it. Nasty don't waste your time. there's a good panda express across town.< /Text>

First time there and hate it. First if all, they over charge my card. I didn't know until I return home and calculate it. Secondly, the cook was confrontational and didn't understand what an itemized receipt was. He said " I don't care about Obamacare, it's the law. The law is not made by YOU!" All I need was an itemized receipt to keep track of my spending.  Ladtly, their fortune cookies was open and place on a dirty tray. If I get sick I will report them to  the  BBB. PLEASE DON'T EAT THERE. IF YOU DO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ORDER. If I could give a rating under 1 star I would.</Review>

This is as good a place for casual chinese food as you will find in the Diablo Valley. Family oriented and very friendly owners work hard to serve quality food at budget friendly prices. Next time you are in downtown Martinez stop in and find out for yourself.</Text>

<Text>Ding Tea has so many drink options and topping options. My favorites are: Matcha Latte, Brown Sugar Milk Tea, Winter Melon Milk Tea, Coffee Latte. My favorite toppings are: Boba, Egg Pudding, and Cream cheese Foam. The boba can be inconsistent but the drink is delicious and creamy. I will be a consistent customer.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>I don't think they intended this, but their taro milk tea does not taste like milk tea and I absolutely love it! I love taro, but hate milk tea and this drink is absolutely divine! I've also tried the passion fruit green tea and it is delicious also.< /Review><user>107387499138993407039<//user>< Rating>

Great little place for milk tea with bobba or Star Jelly or other add-ins. Pricey for two large 16oz with one add-in $10.55
Could of had a nice dinner instead but oh well milk tea is my favorite 😊 Highly recommend it!</Text>

Small shop with limited seats. Busy during weekend night. I ordered a hot oolong milk tea with 30% sugar, it’s pretty good. Not the best oolong milk tea I ever had but it’s pretty decent.<//Review>

<text>Worth taking the long route (instead of exiting Euclid to Chino Hills) just to stop by Ding Tea. The Monster Latte is always consistent - not too sweet or milky. Love the prices ($4ish for a large) versus Tastee’s that are usually $5-6. And the 5 star participation is a huge plus.<//text>< Pics>

It ’s too hard to drink. The taste is completely uneven. The strawberry milk tea is terrible.

Another solid El Pollo Loco location. The parking lot was clean and so was the dining room. Service was quick and the food was decent. Minor complaint that the lettuce in my salad was a little old, but I did show up about an hour before they closed so that might have something to do with it.< /text>

<Review>This review is on the classic chicken bowl only. I am a person that needs flavor such as with onion and garlic sautéed with all my food, especially meat. I don't like the chicken breast without flavor. I am very sorry about my review but I need flavor and the pico de gallo didn't have any cilantro in it either. I was expecting sour cream on the top but I couldn't find it and I don't like hot lettuce which is what happens when you put it on the top of beans and rice. I do like the way they cook the legs and thighs just not the bland chicken breast. Actually I really love their chicken thighs and legs but I want them to come from  a bigger well fed nourished chicken !</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

< Review>
This is one of the best fast food places around! They offer healthy food that always tastes great with premium ingredients. The staff couldn't be nicer or more friendly. I order the double chicken avocado salad which is amazing I could eat it every single day and it's under 500 calories!! Go eat here!! Plus the chicken is bomb too.<//Review>

<Review>These people begin closing at 8pm when they close at 10pm. We got there at 8 and they had already blocked more then half the tabels to keep customers from sitting. They also took all the self serve salsas off at 8:30. We felt so uncomfortable just being there!!! These people make you feel unwelcome. RUDE.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

They closed the dining area before 9:30pm when the hours say open until 10 pm. Went through the drive thru and I couldn't I understand what the woman was saying over the speaker because she was laughing.< /Review>

Solid el pollo loco. My friend is obsessed with them. We go to all and any in any area we go. Got my order 100% correct which doesn't always happen. And my order is a two piece, white meat. I almost always get dark meat but pay fir the other. This place got it right and that means something to me</text>

The worst Pollo Loco. Bad customer service and the Salsa was horrible salty and too watery. The male cook was very rude and had attitude when he was told about the salsa.</review>

(Translated by Google) So so more or less the menu never changes a small glass of pinto beans almost $ 5 necklaces
A rice that never changes and a lousy salad, the only good thing is the chicken, but the very small pieces also look like quail.

Going on. gatherer. Not to be. 🐣 dust as it falls on the. Food and you absorb it by breathing. It is everything I did not like when visiting it. Today

Really enjoyed the food. They have outdoor seating available. (No heaters). Great flavors and spice, not too oily. Everything was fresh and tastes homemade. They have another location in Studio City, there quality shines through on every visit.
Unfortunately, the service was a pretty slow but would definitely come back again.</Review>

<Time>1620520003908</Time><GmapID>0x80c295508f572517:0xdc916891dd702b12<//GmapID><Review>I love Indian food and have tried several restaurants throughout the so Cal area. I was excited to try Flavor of India. However I was left feeling unsatisfied with the entire experience.

After waiting for a table on a busy Friday night, I was finally seated only to wait another additional 20 minutes before anybody came to take my order. I ordered samosas,  chicken Tikka, lamb vindaloo,  Naan,  and rice.
The samosas were not that great. It was rather dull in taste and complexity compared to the fragrance of spices I'm accustomed to in Samosas.
After waiting for another 20 mins, the food starting to come one by one. First was the chicken Tikka. Again. Disappointing from the chicken Tikka I have had other places. Not to say it was bad, but it lacked the unique char and smoked taste that is the signature taste of anything made in the clay oven. It just tasted like regular ol chicken fajitas.
Next the lamb vindaloo. Again the trend continues. Something lacking in the overall flavor profile compared to other versions I've tried.
The saag alo was good, however the potatoes were UNDERCOOKED and just ruined the dish for me. The rice that I ordered never came. Which was just disappointing. Nobody ever came to check on me for well over 30 mins. By the time I could get somebody, to tell them about the rice. The kitchen was already closed. It was just a disappointing experience for me overall and won't be back. The food is by no means bad, it's just not that great either. I think there are much better places to get your Indian fix on.</Review><Rating>3<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

One of the better Indian restaurants I've been to. Went with my wife for dinner a while back (pre-covid). We ordered samosas for appetizers. Very delicious. For main entree we had the chicken tikka masala and the lamb vindaloo and an order if garlic naan.

Everything was well seasoned and tasty. The garlic naan was so good and perfect for scraping off the leftover sauce from our plates. All round a very pleasant meal.<//Review>

last night was the first time we came to that excellent restaurant. But It is obviously not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the attentive service, with the superb cooking and fine drinks and with the modest cost. We will surely return there soon.</review>

The worst food quantity food I have ever received, I paid 45 bucks and didn't even get quantity to be good enough for one person. When I called to ask , they hung up on me.  Would definitely recommend everyone to avoid ordering from this place.  Rudest staff and most unprofessional service you could expect.  On top of that stale food.</Text>

It was my first time here and I came because of the wide selection of vegan options that they offer. So since I did mot know what I wanted (I recently switched to a vegan diet and was never a big fan of Indian food) I orderes the buffet (since 4 of the options were vegan) and I ordered a mulligatawney soup off the menu.  Everything was so good.  I asked for some extra spice for the soup and they briup me this green chili puree that I added to the soup and it just set off all of the flavors.  I even took a soup to go. The spinach saag was another eye opener.  I never knew steamed spinach could taste so good.  I mixed the saag with some lentil, veggie rice and lime and that green sauce and it was heavenly.  Let me tell you, my eyes are wide open now and I can't beliwvw I have been missing out on Indian food my whole life! The server was excellent! He took the time to point out all pf the vegan options from the buffet and which dressing was vegan as well for my salad.  The menu has a whole page of vegan options, most are also gluten free! Love this place.  So happy I wandered in.< /review>

<Review>I used to eat here all the time.  Don't order near closing, or take out. I tipped them for takeout (thought I'd be supportive during these times) but I received vindaloo with ZERO potatoes the past 2 times, no regard for what spice level you specify. It's a disappointing decline.<//Review>< user_name>

Best Indian food in la. Even with perhaps a limited menu the food is fresh, full of flavor and food not over cooked. Spice is correctly gauged as far as no spice, or little spice or super Spice. There are even more levels than that of course but those are the three types I tried so I can know if I’m ordering for guests. The food came quick thru Uber eats. Only thing I would sayas a change would be  that the packaging could be biodegradable</review>

lunch buffet is pretty good. they have a good selection of food and many open tables. i come here with my coworkers occasionally. with tax and tip it comes out to be a little pricey for lunch time but overall a good experience.< /text>

I love how the doors/windows are all propped open, the breeze was super nice while I had my lunch. Our dishes came at great speed and Jorge our server took very good care of us.

Flavor of India Burbank is definitely one of my favorite Indian restaurants .</review>

North Indian restaurant with delicious food. Good Combination of Quality and quality. Menu  is good combination of all famous north indian dishes. I like onion naan, chilly paneer, malai kofta. Restaurant Staff is friendly and service is good. Interior is ok, spacious enough to accommodate 20 to 25 people. Restaurant have its own bar.  Common parking is in same building.<//Text>

I didn't have high expectations going in because I've been disappointed by Indian places around LA before but I was super stoked with how well everything came out. If you aren't a fan of spicy food, you may want to ask your server about the level of spice on any meals you order. This place is one of many little gems tucked away in downtown Burbank.<//text>

We was so hungry we ordered chicken biryani the old girl ask do u want to order raita with it means wow they don't server raita with biryani that's its self weird so we canceled our remaining order and waiting for biryani it's came within 5 min in very small plate and it's look like they  just mixed chicken curry in rice and served.

<Review>Great and tasty food with a big variety of vegetarian options for those that don't eat meat. Food might be a little spicy for those that are not used to Indian food but still very taste with lots of flavor. Decoration is very classic and cozy with low lighting. Plenty of free parking in building behind the restaurant.</Review>< pics>

<review>I regret not checking reviews before trying this place. This place is ok for food but the worst service ever! The staff is extremely rude and did not provide bowls for curries even after repeated requests. The price $16 for buffet isn’t worth the experience. I hope they realize that they are in hospitality industry and will improve the service.</review>< UserId.>

For tlmy fellow vegan friends, they always have vegan options readily available at the buffet. If they don't have what's you're looking for, inform them you're vegan and they will hook it up.</Review><Response>None</Response>< name>

Go here. My girlfriend and I are big fans of Indian food and this is my new favorite spot. The buffet is delicious and very reasonably priced. If you like Indian food, you won't be disappointed.<//Review>

Picked up a meal, portions were incredibly small. Also, just no chicken! Rice is an additional cost. This in my opinion is extremely greedy as rice is essential to a goood Indian meal.  Tikki was bland. Korma was bland. Overall, no. So many better options.</review>

The food was good, though not as spicy as I was hoping. They have a very upscale-like interior with a very deep, serene atmosphere. Felt like there should have been some jazz playing in the background and maybe there was... The wait staff check on your frequently and it was a lovely place. I would recommend it for a local Burbank/LA Indian spot, but just don't ask for medium spicy unless you would like it mild... I like things spicy! ;  )<//Review>

Food is too expensive.  And they serve so little food you can't share.  It tasted just like the frozen Indian food I buy at Trader Joe's.<//review>

My husband and I got the vegetarian dinner for 2. It came with 2 somoas and salad to share, your choice of 2 vegetarian or vegan dinners from the menu, naan and a dessert to share. It was very filling and the waiter was very nice and helpful. They are very accommodating for Vegans. One of the owners came to talk to us afterward to ask how everything was. He was so nice and cheerful. We will diffently be coming back when we are in the area.<//Text>

<Review>Love this restaurant! Great location, comfortable and beautiful interior, and friendly staff. Most importantly, the food is DELICIOUS! The dinner entree prices are a bit steep, but I highly recommend the lunch buffet! $12.95 (I believe) for amazing quality food, with great vegetarian options. I love the naan and the samosas especially. Definitely recommend! :)< /Review></record>

<Text>Flavor of India is conveniently located in Downtown Burbank. I've never been a fan of Indian food, but since it's been years since I last tried it, I decided to give it a go.

Surprise! Palate was very happy this go around. The garlic naan was incredible. Tandoori chicken was a bit dry, but the sauce was very well done. The butter chicken & tikka masala didn't taste very different to me, but they were both good. The real difference that I could tell was the texture of the sauces. Finally, we also got the vegetable korma, which was my favorite. The food was flavorful and at a good price range, and the service was good. Do keep in mind that I have nothing to compare this experience to, but rather I rate this as an Indian food first timer.

Thank you Flavor of India for awakening my taste buds for Indian food. I'm now aware of a whole cuisine that I have been missing out on.  Great LA local business.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Not friendly. Im not familiar with the food and the waiter was not suggestive. I had to pull teeth to know what is good on the  Menu. Waiter did not offer anything to drink just brought tab water and there was a Bar in the resturant across from me. Bad waiting experience but food did taste good. A little too garlicky but that was fine i like garlic< /Review>

The food was good. The waiter was nice. But the server and the rest of the staff was horrible. The place is a little run down which I didn't mind, but the place needs a serious cleaning. The light fixtures  have clumps of dust it's was bad.< /Review>

< Review>
Walked in to hear buffet service ends at 2:30, looked at their menu and everything is around 12 dollars and up. Indian restaurants in this area have it all wrong, and it shows. Both Indian restaurants which are a block away from each other, fully empty at rush hour. This place is super dark and when I walked in there were 3 restaurant workers literally laying down on the booths with their shoes off as if this thing was a hostel. The smell was foul and they have the nerve to ask for these prices LOL laughable. You can cook your own food at home, you come to a restaurant for the experience and for someone else to wash dishes. The experience in this place is similar to going to skid row downtown LA to have a meal, people laying around and foul smell. Didn’t even sit down, I’m sure the food could be good but I would never sit down to eat in this filth. Yuck. Omg wow.<//Review>

<Review>Buffet was fair. Service ok. Had to ask for water 3 times. Our waiter spoke very poor English. We saw as Indian people came in they received much better service.<//Review>< pictures>

We've been going to this restaurant since they opened. There's a daily lunch buffet, consisting of salad, rice, a vegetarian dish, tandoori chicken, a meat dish or two, naan, pakoras, and chutney. The food is fresh and delicious. The service is always exemplary. This is one of our go to places for Indian food. It's tucked away, but not hard to find at the bottom of the parking structure.</text>

Excellent flavor, had the chicken vindaloo, chicken tika masala, and saag paneer. Wish the vindaloo was hotter, but flavor-wise it was one of the best I've had. It wasn't overly vinegary like some places do it.</review>

The worst Indian restaurant in the area. service was awful and they snuck in charge for a dish we didn't order which I had to point out(it could've been easily slip through my attention). Also very over priced for the quality food they had. I've been to many Indian restaurants in the area and I try similar dishes to compare them, and this one by far the most disappointing experience.< /Text>

Place was almost empty at 5:30 on a Saturday, when we walked in one of the waiters was asleep at one of the tables right when you walk in the door, after being seated we waited for 15 minutes and no one came over to even ask us if we wanted a drink yet one of the waiters was standing in the dining room watching tv. I was pretty surprised at how much the waiters didn't care and even the fact that there is a tv in the dining room shows that this place isn't being ran right. What a joke these guys need to get their act together!<//review>

The food is not delicious. It didn't taste the way we expected it to be. The food price is quite expensive for the quality and quantity. The fish curry in particular was not good. If you decide to go to an Indian restaurant, search for another place.<//text>

<Text>Had dinner, Food is OK in taste but quantity wise is less. We took Chicken tikka masala and couldn't finish even one Naag properly.
Maybe lunch buffet would be good option to try for with multiple varieties which we had in Santa Monica in same restaurant brand.< /Text>< user_name>

Great lunch buffet experience, you honestly cannot help but pile on the food on the plate. Vegetarian options are available as well as the classic Tikka Massala. I highly recommend ordering one of their  Naan Breads, my particular favorite is the cheese Naan bread.<//review>

This restaurant is awesome! It's simple, and maybe a little loud. But probably has the best prices for the highest quality indian food I've had in SF. We enjoyed mango lassis (delicious), vegetable pakoras (great flavor), garlic naan, and chicken tikka masala. Fantastic dining experience, great service, will go on the list a must have for union square area food!</Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>I had a very bad experience with the order I placed :(.

I ordered Chicken Briyani and got a rice mixed with some chicken masala; when asked, got a response that this is how a Briyani would be and many customers appreciated that. I am not sure who appreciated or whoever appreciated know how a Briyani tastes. They should have told that they do not serve Briyani, I would have gone fro some other GOOD restaurants.
Paid 30 bugs for a mixed rice. Literally disappointed with this!< /text></record></dataset><record>

This was the worst indian restaurant that i ever visited. The Chef didn't know the difference between Paneer Tikka Masala and Paneer Butter Masala.
We had asked for Spicy Paneer Tikka Masala and the Chef simply added RED CHILLI powder. The food was not tasty at all. Biryani was also very bland. I felt as if Rice was cooked with Potato and Cabbage Curry -- i would NOT recommend this restaurant for Indian food. The hotel & the location is nice but the owner needs to hire a better cook and a good manager :-)</Text>

{'time': 1520813119575, 'text': 'Hi Dharan ,\n\nThank you for your feedback,however that is unlikely and due to a miscommunication somewhere.we would like to welcome you to contact us and correct your review ,as we are sure that not having tea does not constitute a 1 star review.  It’s first drink in the menus and is called ‘Masala chai’, and we are never out of stock. Please feel free to call us and tell us about your experience to look into this matter directly. We would look into it immediately. But we definitely have Indian tea and we ensure we are fully stocked as it is a common order item.\n\nThank you !'}</response>

<gmapID>0x80c295508f572517:0xdc916891dd702b12</gmapID><Text>(Translated by Google) Good service and delicious food, average price per set is $ 16. yes ... everything is separately, that is to say that in this type of restaurant you will never find a complete meal on a set, you have to order the rice separately, the bread separately and so on.
It may be a bit more expensive than other places, but it's worth roughly $ 50- $ 60 for 2 people. This type of service is ideal for sharing, you order several dishes and everyone at the table shares.

Buen servicio y comida deliciosa, precio promedio por plató es de $16 dólares. eso sí...  todo es por separado, es decir que en este tipo de restaurante nunca vas a encontrar una comida completa en un plató, tienes que ordenar el arroz por separado el pan por separado y así.
puede ser un poquito más caro que otros lugares Pero vale la pena aproximadamente entre unos $50 Y $60 por 2 personas. Este tipo de servicios es ideal para compartir, ordenas varios platos y todos en la mesa comparten.</Text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) I love this place, the food is very good, the staff friendly and available.
There is a good variety of choices on the map, also drinkable.
The taste is authentic and you can even choose the degree of chilli of your dish (for those who, like me, avoids spicy dishes)
Tip: when coming to many, choose a dish and share to discover the menu!
A good place to keep!

(Original)
J'adore cet endroit, la nourriture est tres bonne, le personnel sympathique et disponible.
Il y a une bonne variete de choix sur la carte, en boisson egalement.
Le gout est authentique et vous pouvez meme choisir le degre de piment de votre plat (pour ceux qui, comme moi evite les plats epices)
Conseil : en venant a plusieurs, choisissez chacun un plat puis partager afin de decouvrir le menu !
Une bonne adresse a garder !<//Text>
