The repairs on my car and customer service felt seamless from beginning to end. Caliber Collision's work on my car was excellent. My car looked as good as new and the paint work looks perfect! It  was great how they took care of my rental car by signing me off on the computer so I didn't have to return the rental car back to Enterprise car rental when I picked up my car. They were happy to take care of everything for me!</review>

Everyone at Caliber were so nice and attentive!  I did not have to wonder what was going on with the repair of my vehicle. They provided me constant updates during the repair process and let me know ahead of time what my estimate would be and the possibility of additional repairs if necessary. And, they also handled my rental car reservation pickul/drop-off, which made it easier for me to do this during my lunchtime from work.  Very happy!< /review>

I have taken my car to Caliber Collision on 2 different occasions. Once was on my own and the other time was an insurance claim. Both times they did a great job at repairing my car. The people there were very helpful and courteous. Any problems the came up after the repairs were handled to my satisfaction. I have no complaints about them fixing my
Car. Highly recommend<//review>

<text>i brought my car to Caliber for repairs after an auto accident. The people are friendly and knowledgeable. The entire process was well-organized,  explained to me thoroughly with regularly updates on repair progress, changes, etc. The paper work beginning to end was completed efficiently and completely...I did not have to lift a finger! All staff were welcoming, friendly and well-organized!!!</text>< pics>

This is the 2nd time I've used Caliber Collision for work my vehicles. Again, they didn't disappoint. Explained everything step by step along the way. Worked flawlessly with my insurance company. Did a fantastic job to get my car back to where it was pre-incident. Thank you Alan at the Rancho Santa Margarita shop for your excellent work.<//Review>

From the moment I walked into the door, the staff and especially Daniel greeted me promptly and I was given a quote and picked by by Enterprise (rental car company located one street over) and I was off in my rental car in a matter of 30 min (entire drop off process). My car looking brand new within 5 days and I was extremely pleased with the detail (car perfect, polished and cleaned). I paid my deductible because I went through my insurance but it was all worth it. Yay I would 100% recommend Caliber Collision to friends and family.< /Review><userid>113362907598598943514<//userid><gmap_id>0x80dceb982846da83:0x5e2a702e49bfeb5c<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>After someone backed into my daughter's car, the hatch still opened and closed ok, but the dent had to be fixed promptly, because if it rained, water would leak into the car.😢 We got an estimate from Caliber and one other company, and Caliber's was very clear and fair. They kept us updated on the repairs by text every day, and dealt with the insurance company directly--we didn't have to do a thing. The repairs were completed 7 days ahead of schedule. When we picked up the car, the process was fast and seamless, and we were very pleasantly surprised at the wonderful job they did. No evidence of the damage remained, and the car looked fantastic. They had even cleaned and washed the interior and exterior of the car, and it was gleaming! Best of all, though, is that the professionals at Caliber seem to understand that getting your car repaired after it's been hit is stressful enough--they respect the customer's time and are always pleasant to speak with. This process ended up being much less painful than I thought it would be! Highly recommend.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dceb982846da83:0x5e2a702e49bfeb5c< /GmapID>< user_name>

Alan was in touch with me almost every day.  They worked smoothly with my insurance.  They did a fantastic job on the body work and paint.  They even detailed the car inside and out and found and returned an earring I had lost months ago in the bowels of my car.  I would use them again if needed and highly recommend them to others.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1602602451780, 'text': "Hi Diana, thank you for your wonderful review!

This is not the first time I have brought my car in and seems to have the same problem every time which is lack of communication I brought my car in for a  3 days repair the car was supposed to be done on Tuesday so when I call on Tuesday they said no the part is not here so it will be ready on Friday, I shouldn't have to call just to find out the car is not going to be ready they should have let me know a day before or same day that I'm sorry the car is not ready we are waiting for the parts and then when I call back on Friday to ask them so when do I pick up the car just to hear the cars is not ready again, the part is not here yet but why don't you call me let me know don't let me call just to hear negative and then they said should be ready in next Tuesday so then when I call Tuesday again and nobody calls me let me know that the car still not ready, so finally we got the car on Friday two weeks later. so my problem is lack of communication and lack of customer service on some people this is a quote on quote of one of the guys told my wife please don't have your husband call us... I just want to know when is the car ready.. so that's why I give you guys poor rating and let me tell you some people there are nice I'm not going to say the all are jerks and this is not the first time i have brought my cars in, its like a second or third time I have brought my car in, and it seem like the same problem every time i bring the Car in..especially for some people like me I didn't have rental on my contract with insurance co.  i was stranded at home.<//review>

I have extremely high expectations and this specific location has always gone above and beyond. My car has been hit twice and I've taken my car to them both times. The minute you walk in you're greeted by a friendly and professional Caliber Collision staff member. Both times I've been blown away by their customer service and professionalism. Their quality of work and standards are very high and they do an incredible job to return your vehicle the way it should be. This is the only body shop I will take my car and would recommend to friends or family.< /Review>

<Review>Not very happy with their handling of my car after it was crashed into.  Held my car for over a week during which communications were very infrequent and vague, before I found out that it was a total loss and wouldn't be repaired.
If you want your car repaired quickly, I would not recommend taking it to this shop.  Their motto: "We restore the rhythm of your life."  Maybe they do, but they certainly take their time about it.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1608073251658, 'text': 'Hi rchandos, thank you for reaching out to Caliber Collision.

My Tacoma was recently at Caliber Collision so they could repair some damage to the underside of my driver side door. I worked with Osiel throughout the process and couldn't have been happier. He told me the work would be done within about a week which I was skeptical about because usually body shops and contractors over-promise on completion dates but sure enough, it was done! Osiel also called me a couple of times during the repair process and kept me up-to-date on the progress which was nice. The truck turned out great too!< /text>

I was rear ended right before the world shut down due to covid...   ALAN my service tech and Brian were both amazing!   They were so professional, efficient and most of all communicative!   They felt with my insurance and because they are contracted,  if anything "more" needed to be done once they got in there,  it was already approved!!  No need to fight with insurance!!  I received my car back exactly when they said I would,  and it was perfect!

Thank you Caliber!!   Great job,  great crew!!< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Brought our car in for minor body repair. Luis our technician who was in the process of fixing the body repair found an engine repair that was overlooked by our normal car dealership maintenance department.
Luis had our vehicle back in a day with all of the body and engine repair complete! Our car looks great and runs like new!

<review>We could not be happier with our experience at Caliber Collision!  We knew we were in good hands with Brian as he walked us through the entire process.  His communication and regular updates were excellent.  He was able to deliver exactly what he promised and the car was even delivered ahead of schedule!  On a side note, the technician Ron identified 2 loose bolts on my sons suspension, unrelated to the accident.  Thankful to them going above and beyond and for having a critical eye when it comes to the details.  I would highly recommend Caliber Collision in RSM to anyone!</review>< Response>

<text>I have to say that Caliber Collision in RSM is the best. Daniel Holton really helped me out between making paperwork easy, working with my schedule, and getting my car back to me in tip top shape! I especially have to thank the guy that did the paint job on my bumper, it looks great! Hopefully I never need to bring my car here again, but if I do I know my car will be in good hands. Thank you so much!< /text></record>

<review>These people are amazing! Lets face it, if you are going to a body shop then you are probably having a crappy day. The people at Auto Collision Solutions turn a crappy day and situation into a positive, helpful and professional experience. They are willing to do what their name suggests, find solutions. I am the typical poor college student and Arron Holmes, one of the managers, was able to work with my budget and get my car fixed. Not only was work great so was the service. They called me periodically to let me know the status of my car and they finished it a day ahead of schedule! Later, when I picked up my car I found out that one of the painters decided to stay late to finish my car. To me, that says a lot about a person and the pride they have in their work. If you have to go to a body shop (and I pray you don't) then look now further than Auto Collision Solutions!<//review><userid>111693633268249485216</userid></record>

<user_name>Jon C< /user_name><Text>I was in an accident about a year ago and had some major work done. Everything was fine and dandy for a day. Simply put the work done here is lazy. They did not align my car, which was affected in the accident. They spared all costs in the repairs. They actually forgot to put a hose clamp onto the radiator and thus all radiator fluid leaked from my car, causing it to overheat. I had to bring it back 2 times that week, once to get the hose clamp reinstalled and for an alignment. The place they brought it to did a poor job of the alignment and I had to bring it in a second time for them to do it again. Flash forward to today, during the installation and repair they apparently gouged the brand new radiator and now it needs to be replaced. I am here for a 4th time to get a new radiator installed. Needless to say I don't trust them one bit, but I am also not gonna pay for a brand new radiator so I am forced to deal with them again. Never trust a mechanic that can't do the job right the first time. Never coming back here again that for sure.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Also the bartender was very nice and helped me choose the best beers. This place has such a cool old vibe right smack in the middle of Chinatown. Recommend this place  to anyone that wants to try something off the beaten path.</Review>< pics>

Really cool local spot in Chinatown. Stopped by to have a drink, everyone welcomed me as if I were a regular. Jerry & Cuong the owners were very friendly and the bartender was super nice. The crowd was really cool and Mr Wong bought a round for everyone including me. Really fun, had a blast. Will stop by next time I'm in town.< /review>

<Review>Old school Chinatown bar with a great staff! They rotate their beers on tap often, but it's a good thing because most of the things on tap are superb. Also they offer Powers whisky! My go to next to Jameson.</Review></record>

Good small dive bar with decent beer selections (e.g. Lagunitas IPA and Anchor Stream) . During happy hour, beers are $3.5 per bottle. HH ends at 8pm.

Come watch football or Warriors games. There are 4-5 TVs, but they are small. Thus, the place gets 4 instead of 5 stars.

Free WiFi!< /Review>

I have been bringing every car I have driven to Paul and the guys over at Bancroft Auto Repair for well over 20 years. They ALL are awesome , honest ,efficient, reliable, respectful and kind. They do excellent work and they are very reasonable!!! You won’t be disappointed!! I love them all.  They fix your car and get you back on the road.  I have never experienced them having my car more than 3 days.  Usually same day or the next I am back on the road.</review>

This was my 1st time here but I will be bringing my cars here from now on. Very honest, straight forward, dependable, and extremely courteous. Funny too lol. My car was completely dead, not getting any power anywhere. They got me back on the road in a few hrs and cost was very reasonable! Thank you!< /review>

I can not say enough good things about Bancroft Auto shop. In my 3 visits they inspected my new to me used Honda, diagnosed a srs light code, replaced my master and slave cylinder on the clutch and have steered me clear of spending unnecessary money on my car. Paul and his staff are capable, personable responsive, extremely honest and best of all- very inexpensive. You should strongly consider giving Bancroft a try.</review>

Always get the job done in a timely manner, work is well done. Had started with them in 2000, moved away in 2008, but Son used them for his work to be done. I have returned. My son had a car of mine, which needed repairs, it was only there two days.  Glad to be doing Business with you again. Thanks Rick & Paul.< /text>

I have been a customer since 1999. I have referred friends and family to this shop. Rick & Paul have always told my the truth about my cars and have always been fair with the cost. I will always recommend them to anyone who wants great work at a great price!😊</review>

They guarantee their work. If I can help it, I won't go anywhere else. They are so personable that they remembered my name. That's important, in my opinion.< /Text>

<Review>Wow wow wow, I love Salvadoran food. Just found this little spot that just opened six weeks ago and tried it for the first time. What a pleasant wonderful surprise. They just open so you have to be a little patient but the food comes out amazingly fresh and delicious. Family owned. I met the mom and and her son and  they are very sweet.  Highly recommend you give it a try!<//Review>< Pics>

Didn't like this place much.
Ambiance is good. Food taste and quantity is not bad but not great too.< /Review>

This restaurant is my number one place.  Of all restaurants I know I prefere it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to visit this restaurant. Whenever  I want to go to a good meal, this is the place that comes immediately to my head. excellent and many types of  food and a rich menu.generous crew, and pleasant mood. In addition to that, the pay is decent. I praise this place with no hesitation.<//Review>

Food is good, if they have it. Drinks are not great. They were out of avocados and salad dressing. Wet burrito is delicious, as is the camarones. The owner apparently doesn't buy enough food to last through the weekend.< /review>

When she gave me my bill it was $5 so I handed my card, she literally tells me the minimum is $10. There was no posting anywhere saying $10 card minimum. I tried to explain I have allergies and I can only eat that. THEY DID NOT CARE. Didn't even listen to me about my allergies. Rude service.</review>< pics>

This was my first time here so I thought I would order a simple dish, the taco. I was pretty disappointed by undercooked rice with  microwaved beans and a single unnecessarily deep-fried taco. The chicken within the taco was amazing. But if you can't cook rice, what's the point? Would not go back.< /review>

Very delicious food great service loved the atmosphere. Very cozy place to sit with family or for two. Had the taco plate my shell did not get soggy beans ana rice stayed hot too the last bite. Brother had chili verde plate meat was tender. Sister had nacho plate it was bigger then she thought. Salsa was nice and hot the way we love it chips were crunchy and very homemade.  Definitely coming back we are from out of town saving this place to our most favs!</text>

<response>None<//response><text>Small location. Nice tables and chairs but has plastic forks and knives. The sangria was $5.50 for a small, think glass of watered down wine with fruit. Friendly staff. The televisions were all on Telemundo so the staff could watch TV. Parking lot was tricky to get into. Food was okay. Not the touted "best" of anything.<//text><Name>Monika ADR<//Name>< Time>

Very small portions and rude server. I think she the owner or manager (larger woman). I ordered the papa burrito which was the more expensive items on the menu. When the food came she plopped the plate on the table and quickly walked away. It was very small with hardly any ingredients inside. I thought it was a joke at first. Guess not.<//text>

<review>First of all never place a sign that says it's the best...customers expectations will be HIGH. For Starters the table was dirty...I used about 7 baby wipes just to clean the area my baby was sitting at. The menu was stupid...combos sucked, food took forever and when it finally arrived I would have rather of gone to Taco Bell. Sorry but super over priced, nasty generic mexican food. Not home cooked. We went against our restaurant we frequent to try this place out, never again...you want food food, drinks,  and consistency...Taqueria Telaquepaque! Been going there to the Lincoln location for 14+years< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>The team at Karns & Karns is wonderful. Extremely professional, super friendly and very fast. They arranged treatment for me literally the following day after I initially contacted them. I want to give a special thanks to Vanessa who went above and beyond checking in on me and making sure i was taken care of. She made the process more comfortable and was very efficient in getting things done in a timely manner.

They did amazing negotiating my medical liens in order to get me the highest settlement possible so that I can still get more treatment as needed. Highly recommend the attorneys and team at Karns & Karns.<//Review><user_name>Mari V.</user_name><Pics>None</Pics><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

My attorney Vanessa has done absolutely amazing with my case. Very professional and timely. Vanessa was able to get all of my medical needs taken care of, and provided me a wonderful physical therapist. She has settle my case for a much lager amount that I was expecting. I would highly recommend Karns and Karns, especially Vanessa. Unfortunately I was recently in another accident, and Vanessa one again is handling business. I really appreciate them!!<//review>

Listen - straight up.... I FIRED my first lawyer and came to Karns & Karns.  They got me.... I swear to god.... close to 18X what my previous lawyer wanted me to settle at.  EIGHTEEN TIMES the amount.  Let that sink in and then tell me Bill Karns isn’t the shark you want on your team.  BIG THANKS to Bill and everyone on the team at Karns & Karns.</Review>

I was referred to Karns & Karns by a friend after I was rear-ended. From the moment I contacted them I felt like I was going to be taken care of. They handled all communication with my insurance company and of the individual who crashed into me. I got all the treatment I needed to make a recovery. I was kept up-to-date on my case at least monthly to ensure they were working on it even through the pandemic. I was extremely happy with communications I received from Martha and gave me peace of mind. I was very happy with the results and would recommend them to anyone that is involved in an auto accident without hesitation. Thank you again for all the help!< /review>

They seem genuinely concerned about my case. My calls never go unanswered and my texts are always replied to. They make sure that I completely understand what is going on and provide me with the best advice in things to avoid. Calling them I feel is going to make a positive change in my life.<//Text>

I watched the video that the brothers made, and it was not like what they describe at all. I wouldn't hire them again . I'm very disappointed on how they handled my case. They were not professional, leaving me in the dark, not updating me. I would call and hear kids crying and screaming in the back ground, They would pick up the phone finish there conversation with the person in the room, then say Hello to me. Client Service was nothing like the video.<//review>

I got into a bad accident with a semi last year while 8 months pregnant. We contacted karns & karns and right away they got on the case. I felt like I was in the right hands and they had me take all the right steps. Vanessa helped me throughout the whole process and I 100% knew I was in the right hands.

<Text>I highly recommend Karns and Karns as your car accident lawyers.  They arranged all of our medical appointments and treatment.  Vanessa Garcia is our case manager and she always answered all of our questions. Also, Vanessa  kept us updated on what was going on in our case.  Mike Karns is our attorney and he was always available if we needed to talk to him.  Car accidents are a stressful time in your life and you always want a great attorney and team to represent you.

The Karns Brothers have taken Exceptional Care of my parents, they were in a Horrible Accident, driver at fault was killed on impact unfortunately and their skills were necessary to navigate the insurance, high medical costs, hospitals involved ect.. I will forever be grateful for their Great Legal minds and Sound Advice.<//text>

Extremely friendly and professional staff. They were able to answer my questions over the phone and immediately informed me if I had a case worth pursuing. I can't wait to begin working with them. I've recommended the Law offices of Karns & Karns to my friends and family. Do yourself a favor and give them a call!< /text>

The first time I called they were unable to help me with my first case because it was something they did not specialize in, but they took the time to explain why and guided me in the right direction. Their customer service was so great that I called them several months later so that they can help me with my auto accident. All the members of their team are really friendly, helpful, and they genuinely care about me. I’ve recommended a handful of my friends and family to them because I trust them.

Bill Karns is a young man that knows what he is doing. He was very helpful and knowledgeable. He spent 30 mins on the phone with me explaining the case process. The customer service was wonderful. The girl that helped me, I think her name was Jessica, was helpful. Thank you Karns brothers.</text>

<review>I had a Auto vs Auto case with Karns & Karns.
I am totally happy with the service I got with these attorneys and their staff. Everyone was always nice and quick with answering my questions regarding my case. I tried to handle this alone with the other guy that caused the accidents insurance company but they kept giving me the run around. I am happy with the settlement Karns and Karns got me in the end when it was all over. And I will for sure refer my friends and family to these guys if they get into the situation I was in.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1618602686986, 'text': "Hi Mr. Hernandez!

I had a great experience with Karns & Karns. The case managers were very kind and willing to take my calls and they even used texting. Another great thing about this firm is that the attorney was actually available to me. He took my calls and even agreed to meet up with me by my house. I still don't feel 100% but I appreciate the work this firm did.</text>

What ever you do please leave time to set aside to waste.  This is the most unprofessional lawyer group I've ever spoke with.  After months of trying to get through to a woman named Claudia she tells me over the phone the intial case they accepted now is not good.  And my only alternative is to seek another lawyer.  Talk about passing the buck.  This place crawls with shaddiness.  Use them with caution and prepare to have your time wasted.  You've been warned!< /Review>

I'm the one getting 30% of my settlement😣 I guess I paid for Karns  and the doctors another Tesla. Karns DIDN'T keep in touch throughout the case. It's a paralegal mill, when you call in, it sounds like a call center in India. I learned a valuable and expensive lesson. Once they settle your case, they get back to you whenever. I keep calling to see when will I receive my check, straight to voicemail.They have their money, I guess I have to wait on my chump change.< /review>

<Text>Had my car serviced here a few days ago, nothing too crazy just an oil change, air filter replacement and tire rotation. It was smooth and easy (I had an appointment), I just walked in and they pulled my car into the bay shortly after. The wait didn't seem long, and then I was on my way. Staff were all polite and made good conversation. I definitely plan on coming back.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

A1 staffing here. This was the 4th place I had been to in 4 days to have my AC checked & refilled after being Jerard around from the 3 previous shops. It was nice to be informed what was going on step by step. They've definitely gained a new customer< /text>

<text>Bought 4 new tires for my Chevy dually (K-3500) Put them all on the back & I'm VERY happy. The people there were real nice & even answered a couple of questions... Like "Why is the hood up if you're only putting on tires?" 😲
They were doing a courtesy check of my fluid levels. (Oil & what not)😂😂
Will DEFINITELY go there again for tires</text>< pictures>

Called them told them I had a nail on my tire coming back from Vegas. Told them I put a can of seal and air in it. Once I get their they say they can't fix it due to seal and air I already told them but can sell me a tire. I took it elsewhere and had it repaired saving me hundreds of dollars and keeping my tires matching. I would never go back here. My dad did when I was a kid but it is not the same now. Go elsewhere.<//Review>

I’m somewhat new coming here. The few times I’ve come I’ve had good experiences. Raeth and Lacy always give great service and explain things very well. This time I had an issue and I thought it might go bad. Well, I was wrong. You can always tell how a business  really is when there’s an issue. They went above and beyond to fix the issue and make it right with me. I’ve been in retail most of my life and this kind of Great service is hard to find. Thank you to the Manager ( I didn’t catch his name) for helping resolve the issue. Great Job guys! I highly recommend coming here. Jeff M. White Jeep Compass :-)< /text>

Worst service ever. I'm a long time customer bringing in my car for what I thought would be a simple brake issue and it turned out to be more. It started out with one fix, then another and then another with still no resolve. Have to wonder if the people working there are trained properly. They can't seem to diagnose and fix the problem right. I've spent more than I want to there and have been told my car is fine when I leave only to find out it isn't. I'm forced to bring it back because its unsafe to drive. I guess whoever test drives these cars hasn't a clue to what is safe. Seems certain people at the counter don't really show much concern either. Today when I picked up my car again I was advised that they couldn't' fix the problem because they didn't know what it was. I was refunded part of my money and told to take it to the dealership. What a waste of time. I'd recommend going elsewhere.< /Text>

Oil change was good. Price was good. The counter person pulled off her mask to talk to a mech that was not wearing a mask. They were  within three ft of each other. Mech did not wash his hands before getting into my car. Im 67yo and this behavior really scared me. Manager needs to check it out before someone gets sick over there.<//Text>

First time visiting a FIRESTONE TIRE SHOP and it was Johnny  manning the counter. And he was great. Friendly, knowledgeable staff in a very clean shop. Answered my question/concerns, offered direction,  and didn't try to over sell me. Ever. Picked my jeep up right when they said I could and everything we discussed was completed. I liked the experience so much I opened an account.< /text>

<Text>These guys are scam artists, they gave me the run around on my warranty tires. At first i got a tire pressure light that came on, I brought it in to check it out. They told me my front left tire had two nails in it so they couldn’t repair it and had to replace it under warranty for $50. Not too long afterwards I get another tire pressure light come on and now it’s the exact same story but on my front right tire. Not too long after that I’m driving to work and yet again I get another tire pressure light come on, I stop to see what happening and I can hear air leaking out of my rear right tire. Ok so I get things happen on the road but not like this not one after another. I have spoken around and I get the same story from multiple people. So my conclusion is that these guys are truly scam artist and make you come back to repay for tires over and over again. If you’re shopping around for a tire place I suggest you look elsewhere because there is no worry free service with Firestone. Absolutely the worst service I have ever gotten,< /Text><name>Alvin Ruiz<//name><response>None<//response>< Rate>

< Review>
Wanted oil change and needed to have belts checked. Left being told belts were fine. Took car to another place. Timing belt loose. Very disappointed. Tech marked all 4 tires as cracked. Tire store said not the case. May be a single lady of age but really? Paid extra for belt inspection. I can't recommend this place<//Review>

Sorry folks.  I do not have a favorable opinion of this place.  They went from happy, helpful to searching for things to charge us for.  I paid off my credit account and sent them my cut up card.  After 7 years, We're through.</Text>

I had a great experience there. I went in for a repair on my tire that had a nail on it and they repaired it in a timely manner. I didn’t feel pressured to buy or do any other service. They made my son and I feel comfortable. I would highly suggest them. Bruce was so kind to answer all of my questions. Thanks once again!<//text>

My parents jeep was taken there today for an oil change as it always goes there faithfully but today the Jeep came home on a tow truck. The incompetent worker broke the oil pan weld inside the oil pan and wouldn't take responsibility for it and was told it would cost over $500 for US to fix it even though it was their fault!!! They took no responsibility and now it sits in the garage till it's fixed leaving us stranded! Beware!! Do not go here!! Giving them one star was still way too much! !</Review>

<text>Walked in the store on the way home from work. The girl at the counter was apparently too busy to give eye contact or even acknowledge that I walked in the door.  After about 10 minutes Katie comes in from the back all smiles and eager to assist as ALWAYS. Thank you Katie, after explaining I only needed a head lamp for my car I was literally out of there in less than 5 minutes. The excellent customer service in this store is always constant. (Except for Miss too busy to say, "I'll be with you in a moment"). Johnny, you've got a great team! Even though you weren't in the store Katie made sure that the customers are still treated with excellent service. keep up the good work!< /text>< username>

<text>We took the vehicle in for a free brake inspection. Received a call stating car needs new rotors, calipers, hoses and brakes. We just replaced them all along with a new master cylinder, within the last week. They wanted $1400+. We decided to get the vehicle and bring it home to have another mechanic work on it. Low and behold the FREE brake check turned into towing $29.99 for the brake check. They said they had to do a diagnostic, which we did not authorize, saying my son signed to have it done. My son did not agree to a diagnostic, nor did he sign any paperwork for said work, nor was he given paperwork. His signature was forged!<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

They always do a good job on my car but I feel like they could take my business or leave it. There's no sense that anyone cares if I'm bringing my car there or not. Plus every time I go in they are "really understaffed", like, every time. So an oil change took almost 2 hours. Like I said though, they do a good job so I keep going back.<//Text>

Good experience here!  Very friendly and professional employees over the phone and in person.
I would have given 5 stars, but the work took a bit longer than quoted, and we had an appointment.
But so far, the work they did solved the problem! (grinding noise from needing new rear brake pads)  and they always have coupons online for different services, which is a huge help!</Review>

Update: Took my 2017 Kia Sedona in for an alignment, it was pulling right.  Johnny, my advisor, got me in the same day and did a great job.  The van is now tracking straight and the overall experience was excellent!  I've now been to this shop twice and had a great experience both times.

Original Review: Great experience from start to finish!  Alignment on a 2006 Ford E-150 Cargo Van.

My van has pulled to the right since I bought it.  I've taken it to the dealer twice and had three other shops attempt to fix it.  After two sets of tires wearing out, I started looking for an alignment expert.  I heard back from a couple of sources that Mike at Firestone in RC was excellent.  They were right.  The van is back and tracking straight for the first time since I bought it.

The shop was clean, the guy who checked me in and coordinated the effort was great, and the most important thing, they fixed the problem.

Nice JOB Firestone!<//Text>

Work was fine (so far anyway), but shop can't or won't process a credit card over the phone, unlike every other shop (and business) can. So I had to drive all the way to the shop to pay for my daughter's car in person since she attends college near that shop, and that's where she went when her car broke down. I realize it's probably some mindless corporate policy and not the fault of the folks working there, but it still nets out to a customer service fail.</Review>

Their work is okay and it should be, you pay enough for it! Whenever you need a part after they diagnose a problem for you, you can't got to another place to buy that part cheaper and they don't tell you they CAN'T install customers parts until AFTER you've purchased them, they seem to TAKE DELIGHT in telling you that and if you return for continued service and they can't make anymore MONEY off you, they LOVE to INCONVENIENCE you!

After they complete the work I've already paid FOR, I'm DONE with their "NICKEL SLICK, SLIMEY" asses, NEVER AGAIN will I DEAL with those CROOKS and they're lucky they got two stars!< /Review>

First Big service was because my vehicle overheated and I was told that it was because of my thermostat and thermostat housing was leaking, come to find out only after I paid over $400 for the repairs that it was my fan clutch. Now I’m back again and I wanted new tires for my vehicle and asked for all terrain tires and when my wife came down to have them installed they showed her tires that are not AT tires and then installed them. Now she’s not to savvy in what tires do what. However if they had paid more attention to the request for all terrain and less about getting a sale I’m sure we would not be in this spot. Will not be returning.< /Text>

My go to shop! Jonny is a great guy, he's honest and won't let you down! Firestone is a bit expensive, but it's worth it to know my car is fixed right and Firestone stands behind their work and the parts they use. Jonny doesn't control the prices, but he won't screw you!!!<//review>

I have been a loyal customer to Firestone for over 5 years now. Sadly this is my first and possibly my last horrible experience with this company if this does not get resolved in a timely matter.

I took the vehicle in for full synthetic oil change and as soon as I left the store, the check engine light came on. I called the store and told them what happened so they said I could bring it back in to get it looked at.

When I finally brought the vehicle back in to the shop I let Johnny know about the issues. Ie. The check engine light came on as soon ad I left and the vehicle started shifting abnormally hard. (The hard shifting is more than likely unrelated to the oil change, but I expected the car to get an inspection).

I left the car with Firestone for a few hours and upon my return I was greeted with, "there nothing was wrong, there must have been air in the line. The code is cleared and your vehicle is as good as new." Which was my first red flag.

As I leave Firestone and turn onto Zinfandel the check engine light came back on. Which tells me a few things. 1. They did a bold face lie to thier customer about the services being preformed.  2. The only service preformed was clearing the code.  3. Another bold face lie about not being able to inspect the transmission or it's fluids because there is no "dipstick."

Now, I am not a professional mechanic, but I do have project cars and I do take care of the vehicles on my own when I have time for it. But there is other reasons that a transmission will slip and there is other parts of the vehicle that need inspecting if the vehicle is shifting hard. He could have checked the fluid levels by taking the plug out on the side of the transmission. The Chevy Cavalier has a transmission plug on the side very similar to that of a manual transmission. He could have inspected the filter for clogs or leaks. They could have inspected the transmission and/or axels for leaks or cracks. I'm sure they could have checked hoses and the pump. Point is, numerous things could have been checked and they we're not because there is no dipstick.

If you are the manager or owner of this store you can expect a phone call from me tomorrow morning.<//text>

I can't thank Johnny and his team enough for always taking great care of both my car and suv! From the regular service needs and most recent replacement of rotors that the dealership tried to charge an arm & leg for!! Johnny treats us like family!!<//review>

Nice spacious complex for a large swim meet. Google lists parking as limited, but there seemed to be plenty of free parking even for a large meet, with the adjacent facilities. Pools warm even on this cold morning.</review>

Great spot for open lap swimming. Guests are always friendly and share lanes. $3 for a 50m pool is a deal - and cheaper if you buy a bulk/monthly pass for frequent visits</text>

First time here: first impression o
Is that it's clean and well kept. Pros my toddler could wear her life vest, clean and friendly staff con bigger kids Kinda take over the free time area. I would say it's more suitable for older kids or kids that know how to swim. The peak park pool seems to be more suitable for younger kids although they can't wear vest/ floats there.<//Text>

This review is regarding the Fullerton aquatics Swim Team(FAST) my son started taking swimming classes here since he was 6 years old. From level 1 to precompetition, now he is in swim team. All of his coaches were nice and very helpful to my son except COACH KYLE. He was very rude. My husband talked to him about the new snorkel equipment, my son and other kids were swallowing water because it didn’t have a release. So my hubby approach COACH KYLE and ask if he can teach the kids how to use it properly to avoid swallowing the pool water. He replied by rolling his eyes to my husband and didn’t say anything.  We always talk to my son’s coaches when we have a concerns and they were always polite to answer.

I talked to Coach Kyle and ask when a parent has a concern please reply properly and not roll your eyes on a parent. This is what he said “Don’t tell me how to coach” I wasn’t telling him how to coach. I want him to respect parents, we are the one paying your salary dude. Treat us with respect!!! Be a role model to the kids! Coach Kyle, you are an arrogant person!<//Review>

<Review>Pool is nice especially when it warm out with perfect weather to be on outdoor pool. Greeted nicely at the entrance.  This place is pretty much for people INDEPENDENT SWIM. Everyone does their own swimming. Everyone swims not much of a problem with walkers...lol. :)< /Review><user>109105857719909755140</user>< response>

Best place to take Swim lessons. Period!

Take it from someone who has had their share of water trauma, when I was a teenager, in numerous California swimming pools by other teens. Thank God those years are over, Gees!

I signed up for lessons in 2009 and I was swimming within two sessions. Thanks Janet Evans Swim Complex! The staff were great.</text>

Keep walking if that is all you can do. It'll keep you walking on land. I swim and exercise in the pool and it got rid of a knee problem. Wish It was open more. Love the staff and very clean.< /review>

All the instructors are professional and very patience with the children.
My two nephews didn't know how to swim and just by taking two weeks lessons every day, they are now able to do bubbles thru their mouth,  put their heads inside the water, ckicking and floating. And they are not afraid of the water anymore. They enjoyed the lessons a lot.< /text>< rating>

So sad. They do not know how to resolve comment and concern speciall my kid was drinking pool water with their equipment nothing.  All they can say is noted.  My next is to talk to USA Swimming. If nothng happens KTLA 5.  My son is a minor there should be a law that cover this.

Please note that this is for the swim team with regard to the precomp for children not problem only with the swim team.<//review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Nice corner spot and very quick, and tasty food. Plaza parking usually full, so expect a few minutes to find parking. Ordered Chicken Fried rice, Beef soup (not spicy) and  a few combinations. The rice was nicely seared and the soup was hearty!<//review>

<Text>My stepdad had brought me food from this restaurant on Thursday and it was alright when I ate it. The next day I couldn’t focus on work because of a huge headache and an upset stomach ache. The next 2 days got worse and I had to continuously use the bathroom. I’m still struggling to sleep due to headaches and now I can’t stop scratching myself. My stepdad told me that he went to this restaurant to try it out and the person serving him was being rude. Don’t recommend this place at all, I wouldn’t wish what I’m feeling on anybody else.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Extremely friendly family-owned restaurant. They make food to order without MSG if desired as I'm allergic. They use fresh delicious ingredients at an amazing value! The ambiance is inviting and kept very clean for a fast food Chinese restaurant. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone craving delicious, reasonable Chinese food to eat there or to go!

I'd recommend ordering it made fresh without msg as anything sitting around won't be the best quality after sitting all day.</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I'm almost 41 years old and I have had a lot of Chinese food in my life. This was by far the WORST I have ever had and deserves zero stars. I'm so disappointed because I really wanted to like this place. The orange colored chow mein worried me, but it was the funky smell from all of my food that was difficult to ignore. I'm not sure if the awful smell was the worst aspect of my experience or the indescribable after taste that stayed with me for hours. I absolutely hate leaving a bad review, but I hope this prevents someone else from wasting their money here. I'm not one to frequent Panda Express, but I would take that over this place anytime!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I take my son there twice a month after I pick him up from H.S.  He is a very tall and voracious eater (as most high-schoolers are).  He is always satisfied with their portions for a lot better price than Panda Ex-----.  Their fried rice is much better as well.  Kudos to this very clean restaurant.  They also cook items immediately for you when the item you want is low.</Review>

The food is very good, tip! You can also ask the cashier to make ur food flesh. They also have free drink if you buy a large size of dish,  which means not from the steam table.</Review>

<text>Great food and fast service. First time here and will return again. They hace Chinese fast food, sushi, teas, Boba, and smoothies. And prices for combos are reasonable.

If you come here after 9 it's 50% off on what they got in the steamer.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2d4a3fa65c5dd:0x26747badd3fcb9b1</gmap_id></record>

Sameday Testing gave me a warm welcome when I showed up. It was a pleasant environment and the staff was very generous. I recommend this place for anyone who is looking to get tested rapidly and with no long lines. I was even given a healthy beverage upon leaving from my test. Thank you all for the great service!< /Review>

<Review>This place is amazing. The staff is very kind and walks you through the process of signing into the system and getting an appt right away (on the spot). The staff were very calming and thoughtful. Immaculate, clean testing center in Normal Hts. I highly recommend it for a quick peace of mind test. It’s only $50 if you have insurance. 😃<//Review>< Rate>

< Review>
This is a scary time we are living in and due to essential employment I've had to be tested now 5 times and by far this was the best experience. Everyone was so friendly. I got my appointment the exact same day. The nurses were so gentle I couldn't believe it. I will be recommending my friends and family. 🙏🏼 Thank you<//Review>

I was told I would get my test results back in three days, but I received it back within 24 hours! I am so impressed with this company, would send all my friends and family to get tested at this company. The best group of people!</review>< pics>

Paid for rapid test and they said I would receive my results with 30 minutes. It’s been over an hour and I have not received any results. I tried calling but their phone system just put me on hold forever and no one is answering. I also sent an email but reply there either. Not sure what is going on...< /text>

Convenient scheduling, easy and comfortable place to get tested. I hadn't ever been and it was explained well and done professionally. I feel lucky it's so close to where I live as well. Hopefully won't have to get tested again, but if I do, this is the place I'm going to.<//text>

After a trip to New Orleans, my 6 year old son had to take a COVID test to go back to school. I’m so glad we found this place. As soon as we walked in, my son’s fear of taking a nasal swab disappeared. The place looked like a spa more than a clinic. The staff were all so friendly and patient. Thank you ladies!< /review>

Sameday testing on Adams Ave has this amazing family vibe throughout the whole staff! They are beyond awe-inspiring facility! As you walk in through the door, it does not even feel like your about to get Covid testing done. The made the place so aesthetically pleasing and relaxing so that it calms your nerves before getting tested! The staff always have smile on their face and the greeting is always pleasant! The manager Dustee is amazing!!! She willing do everything in her power to help you! If you are looking for a place that is all about family, this is the place to go!!! There is very little wait time and they are wonderful with children of all ages. Need not to forget to mention they are will to accommodate to people are unable to get out of the car which is so AMAZING!!!!  I highly recommend this facility!!! Though they all act like family, they try to make you feel like you apart of the family.</text>

<Review>My husband and I made an appt online an hour in advance. We were in and out in 5 mins or less and everyone was so nice. Nose swab was not as uncomfortable as a few months ago. Def recommend this place for easels testing. Also, pay yourself rate was best I found.<//Review>< Pics>

This is the finest covid testing site there is!! As sad as it is to need to review a testing site this is our new pandemic reality and I’ve got to say they make it feel warm, welcoming and surprising zen and relaxing. I have told my friends that it is like a cross between a yoga studio, day spa, and doctor’s office! hard to make a covid test feel luxurious but Same Day testing has nailed it! All the staff is also wonderful, kind and inviting. Thanks for making such an awful thing a little brighter! Oh yah and results came back so fast! ( next day) even though the insurance turn around time was 60 hours) This will be my go to center from now on!</text>

<review>The atmosphere of SameDay Testing is comfortable and welcoming which I can’t say about other covid testing places or doctors offices! The staff at the front desk are super nice and knowledgeable giving me all my options for the different tests. The nurses we gentle when doing the nasal swab. I was able to walk in and get an appointment right away with the whole process taking about 10 minutes!! Highly recommend coming here for covid tests!< /review>< rating>

This was my very first Covid test so I was a little anxious, but everything turned out well. Online appointment reservation was easy and quick. Go early in the morning when it's not as busy. It took less than 10minutes from check-in to walking out. Facility is clean and neatly set-up for social distanceling. Nurses are very friendly and gentle with those, sometimes intimidating, nasal swabs. Text-updates provides status report every step of the way until result is sent to your email. Highly recommended!< /review>

<Review>Very nice inside for a strip mall restaurant. Top notch service and professionalism. Great prices on everything especially happy hour specials. I don't recommend the chicken skewers though. The firecracker shrimp and the pa-nang Curry was amazing. Would go back for the curry.<//Review>< Pics>

I love the food and this place is crowded. normally if I order over the phone it would take an hour for pickup so I always order and I were before I get off of work and when I get there my food still wouldn't be ready and people line up outside the store for their food to be picked up. I always have special requests like crushed peanut on the side for the pad thai with extra spicy. no raisin for the pineapple shrimp fried rice. every time my order are accurate and food are always delicious price are decent< /review>

delicious Thai food very busy and crowded. if you ordered by phone be prepared to wait for an hour. my favorites is the pad thai and pineapple shrimp fried rice and the barbecue pork. I tried the barbecue chicken and was not impressed. however their pad Thai is hands down the best that I have ever had< /review>

<Review>Listed as one of the best restaurants in Downey I had to check it out. The place has nice aesthetics and an upscale feel to it. The lemongrass soup was the dish that will make this place one of my favorites. The sampler platter offers a good array of their menu. A five star review would be posted if it wasn’t for the undercooked skewered chicken I had. Other than that it’s a decent dine.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_cr55Hqnzzyfw0cudbP71x0zrog2kWDUuktrx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

I went in expecting good food based off the reviews and I was extremely disappointed. I got Tofu Spring rolls, Pad See Iw, Lemon Grass Soup and a Thai Iced Tea and the food was ok. The tofu spring rolls I get at Whole Foods are much better tasting than the ones I purchased here :(.<//Review>

<text>The last time i ordered from this restaurant was a few years ago i decided to give it a try once again and. was completely disappointed I ordered a seafood soup and red curry... the soup was disgusting it tasted like water with seafood added to it no flavor.. the rice was not jasmine... the curry had no flavor as well .. the boba tasted like soap..  a waste of 40 dollars...  never again if i could give it no stars i would.<//text><UserId.>118246008654171308460<//UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>The most delicious Thai food I've ever had. This restaurant is perfect for a quick lunch during the day and a romantic dinner at night. I particularly like that they promote healthy Thai food vs the greasy and over fried food you get at many other Thai food places. It looks like a hole in the wall and you can really miss it when driving down Firestone Blvd but make sure you stop in. Prices are very reasonable.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

We came for lunch and staff were efficient and fast. The food was delicious and just in time because the Thai restaurant close to my house changed chef and food is not as tasty anymore. Ordered Chicken BBQ lunch and it had a side salad and they offered brown rice as an option. My coworker ordered the chicken with broccoli and enjoyed it too. Visited Narai Thai restaurant many times when I was working; celebrations because food is exceptional; and service is professional; and they have a small bar area too.</Review>

Bad service, they got my order wrong, and the food was cold by the time it got to my door. The only thing they did right was honor my coupon.</Text>

Delicious and amazing Thai food in Downey. Customers service is awesome and it does not take long to have your food ready. I would recommend their spicy Chicken Pad Thai and their Pad See Ew it was delicious 😋<//review>

<text>It was very good. Staff was very friendly and the food came in a timely manner. Everything tasted great. We were very pleased. We've always loved Thai food and this restaurant was not a disappointment at all. I would definitely come again. My only suggestion would be for the plates to be a little bigger, since we normally share plates it was a little small for our family but rather than that everything was good.</text>< name>

Great food. Great atmosphere. My brother loves this place. And the prices aren't too bad either for the amount of food your getting. My favorite thing to get here is the coconut chicken soup. So delicious and warming.< /text>

Their Pad Thai is one of my favorites. I had Rad Na with beef today and it was a bit salty but still pretty good. Mango with rice is really delicious.<//Review>

Looks like this place has been in business for awhile and they must have done Thai food right. I'll definitely recommend this place if you're in the area or wanted to try a new place. They do serve alcohol here and Thai iced tea with Boba is worth a try.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2cdb853082cdf:0x37b8eeec9ebc8a8f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The staff is always friendly,  the food comes out hot & fresh.  The only thing I'm missing is Crying Tiger.  That's kinda hard to find out here,  maybe I'm not looking hard enough.  But I love this little restaurant. Honestly everything looks delicious, and is well presented.  💜</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I like the fact that the service is fast here and the food is still really good. I have been inside the restaurant to dine as well as had food delivered. The food is best when eaten in the restaurant. I usually eat the Yellow Curry or the Shri,p Fried rice. Both are good. I have also tried several of the appetizers and those were tasty too. The atmosphere is good too even though its a small place. The restaurant always has a steady stream of customers.<//text>

<Review>This place is probably the best Asian food within a 10 mile radius. It's about $9-13 per plate and offers some awesome portion sizes so you can take some to go. They just renovated so it looks nicer on the inside than the whole shopping center does, it's not just a hole in the wall. This place is popping every night. Definitely recommend the pad Thai.< /Review><time>1525651400517</time>< response>

The best Thai restaurant I have been to. The service is very accommodating, they took special care to make us comfortable there, by providing paper plates and spoons for my baby. They did not show us a face when she messed around while trying to eat all by herself. Food was super delicious< /Review>

They have an extensive menu of just about everything Thai that you can think of.  Their Happy Hour, 5-7 pm daily features Sapporo beer for $2 (pint) and $8 (pitcher).  Get your suds on!  Happy Hour also has eight  of food specials:  edamame, fried wonton, crab Rangoon, fried calamari, chicken wings, garden rolls, fried dumplings, fried tofu and chicken sate...drinking food!</review>

Whenever I get the urge for some curry, I always go here. I've tried out a couple of other places in neighboring cities, but none seem to match Narai Thai. The green curry with chicken is my fav; Something about the texture of the bamboo shoots completes the meal and makes it unmatchable to me.

Family and friends enjoy the red and yellow curry, as well as the pad thai. I recommend trying the salmon steak. And if you have room for dessert, you can't go wrong with the seasonal mango sticky rice.

The customer service has always been great and I enjoy both taking out and eating in. Greeted with a smile each time I walk in the place. Definitely feel a bit better every time I visit. The quality of the food, the speed of the order, and the hospitality make it for me.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2cdb853082cdf:0x37b8eeec9ebc8a8f</GmapID></record>

The best Thai restaurant I have been to. The service is very accommodating, they took special care to make us comfortable there, by providing paper plates and spoons for my baby. They did not show us a face when she messed around while trying to eat all by herself. Food was super delicious</text>

It's cold inside the restaurant. Their AC is on with a 64 degrees temperature outside. But the food was good. Especially the sticky rice with sweet mango for dessert.< /text>

< Review>
The food itself is five stars; the service however leaves so much to be desired. First issues came about when the server asked whether we wanted our soup to be 'lemongrass' or coconut milk--as far as we were aware, the broth would contain lemongrass with or without the addition of coconut milk. This made ordering confusing.
The same server forgot to add one of the dishes to the meal, and came back later saying she didn't put it in, after we had received our previous dishes.
But the real kicker was how the server kept neglecting our table, whenever I needed a water refill, I had to ask some other available server. Our server kept going to the other half of the restaurant where I witnessed her and other servers doing their hair! It would have been hilarious if it didn't mess up our dining experience. I don't even know if she washed her hands after touching her co-worker's hair.
At the end of the meal, the server brought out a scoop of ice cream 'on the house'. In my opinion, it didn't make up for the poor quality service from this young lady.
We've been coming to this restaurant for YEARS, this is the first time we received such terrible service. Will think twice before coming back here again.</Review>

My go to spot for Thai food. Literally everything I've had from the soulful fish, to the gai kua noodles, the curries, soups, the salads, everything here is delicious. They have dessert, the sticky rice with mango is my favorite. They have the best iced Thai tea ever and they deliver!<//Review>

They don't have free refills. They take the food for one person first and the other has to wait.. And the appetizer is the last thing they take to your table how annoying. Food is good but services is bad.. I have been waiting for more than 7 minutes for my food after my friend got her food. If you dont ask for water they dont give it to you</text>

I went to this place for two and it wasn't that great I have had way better the amount of rice is very minor. The spicy sea food soup was ok for it's price just. I got a side of beef and broccoli for the price it seemed like it was for 2-4 but it was just of one person or even less.
I would recommend that you put pictures on each menu item.< /text>

Good Thai food option. They have a variety of good options. I really enjoyed the tasty crab Rangoon as an appetizer. The food itself was good but nothing amazing. We also had Thai Tea which was ok. The ambience in the restaurant was nice and the service was great! We will be back.</review>

Bar space is good
TV and music all right over your head
Looks like a family business. A reason why they are so nice and they know their own food giving specific details. I got lots when I couldn't decide on desert

Simple but does the job
The workers have such a soft nice environment that dancing occurs
When I was there, I happen to have the privilege and see all the staff workers give a honest happy birthday celebration to a customer

5/5 would visit again<//review>

I love Narai Thai! I've been a loyal customer for about 9 or 10 yrs. I love the happy hr deals. The piña kiss is my favorite cocktail, but they are all good. Nice stiff drinks. Really great tasting dishes at reasonable prices that keep my family and I coming. Our go to dishes are the pineapple shrimp fried rice, panang curry, the Narai sampler, and Thai beef jerky.<//Review>

<Text>It's a decent Thai place but doesn't really have the flavor or service to be worth something significant.  If you have time and appetite, drive a little and go to places in Long Beach.  It will be worth it.  But if you want something close by and somewhat quick, then this is your place.< /Text>< gmap_id>

The prices are good, the food is amazing (I've tried lots of things- from the papaya salad to the curry to the thom yum), the service is good, the ambiance is nice. The parking can get a little packed and you might have to park in the residential area, but that's rare. It's a good place to bring the family or to come from lunch break. I recommend it to everyone I know.<//text><userid>105780565237030877757< /userid>< Resp>

<Text>Found Hair in my food. Forced me to drive back for a refund after already paying for it to be delivered to my house. They didn't want to give me a refund for the food at first unless I drove the food back to them. So I drove to them and asked for a refund for my one item that had hair in it and for my delivery since they made me drive all the way to them for a refund. They refused to refund me my delivery acting clueless, saying its on post mates and not on them. The bag I received was stapled shut. And postmates was not the company forcing me to drive back to the restaurant for a refund. It was Narai Thai. So yes, they are responsible for the delivery fee. I could have asked for the whole order to be refunded but wanted to be lenient about it. Instead, this is how they treat customers. I cannot believe I had to drive it in when they asked for a picture and we sent it to them. They made it seem as if we were going to eat it still or something. I told them, my food came to me with hair in it. It was going right into the trash. They made me go out of my way for no reason. Used to love going here, but never again. And I will let everyone I know this place does not take care of its customers.< /Text>< UserId.>

I'm very glad we found this place. First impressions were great. The ambiance is great, the employees are very very professional and nice. The food is great! It's been a while since I've had good Thai food. Overall our experience was EXCELLENT. Good-bye Hollywood Thai, hello Downey Thai! :)</Review>

<Review>I spent two months in Thailand, the yellow curry at this place tasted just like I remember.

The sampler was also good to order when I came w/ friends.  It came w/ chicken satay (& penut sauce), spring rolls, crispy wontons & other items.
The mango w/ sweet sticky rice was not a hit, however.  We tried it 2 different times & didn't like it.  The sticky rice tasted more like regular white steam rice.  the coconut sauce was too dry.
I usually avoid peak lunch time.  It was so busy there.< /review>< Pictures>

There is nothing really special about this place. The staff is OK and one thing I didn't like was that when they clean the table next to you they spray a bunch of Windex which the smell eventually moves over to your table and now you're eating and smelling Windex at the same time, that's horrible.<//Text>

When I want a healthy take out option, I choose Market Place Grill's Greek Chicken salad. The salad is a good size with plenty of fETA cheese, Kalamata olives and pita bread. I usually split it with my husband because they give you such a generous portion. It never disappoints.< /review>

Tuesday night (8pm)- unpleasant welcoming - the front was busy but the girls were in the back; Drinks were decent; wong tong soup over salted (probably due to beef broth) and heavy in garlic; Good rice...< /Text>

If you want GOOD SPICY HOT THAI FOOD THIS IS IT. I love coming here, I recommend the Pad Thai noodles add the shrimp so worth it, the sticky rice is so good has a slight sweet taste, the assorted spicy seafood has a huge kick if you order hot be prepare for really SPICY HOT. If you live around Downey or Norwalk etc etc... Good place for a Thai craving of exotic food.< /text>

The food is great, the service is okay.  But one thing that was really disturbing  was that in the middle of our meal a nice sized cockroach fell from the ceiling  and landed on my friend edgar's side of the table. He killed it and put it next to him. Lol... so when we left we decided to tell them what had occurred. So she compensated us by giving us free drinks and two sides of steamed rice.lol ( LAME) i was expecting a discount, that's this place gets two stars from me...</Text>

The lady who answered me was extremely rude and didnt let me explained; horrible customer service!!!.  she only said it was my mistake not her mistake and yelling at me. It surprises me her conduct since we are a big company a block away, and didn;t apologize. I placed the order again and they CHARGE ME.  waooooooooo I cannot believe it. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE.

What a surprise from this place, never expected that to happen.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) I have a girl with Autism and in this place we were treated badly ... because of my daughter's condition !!! It bothered them to walk inside the restaurant ... while we waited for them to take the order ... they even dared to suggest that we go to eat apart from the other customers !!! BAD COSTUMER SERVICE.
