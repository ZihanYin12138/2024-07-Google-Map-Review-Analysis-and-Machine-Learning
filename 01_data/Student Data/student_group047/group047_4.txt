Buyer beware do not take your business here I bought me a viper car alarm model 3100 and had it installed here about 8 months ago, later on my alarm started acting up I would go driving and it would just go into anti-theft mode where the car would just shut off and wouldn't start I called sound wave to let them know what's going on and to ask where is the reset switch / valet switch he told me they don't install those on viper models????? I told him that's fine I'll just have my car towed home upon further  inspection tucked away really good lo and behold there was the valet switch and since I was already there i might as well take a look at the box , WOW!!!!!!!!!!! The box was a  used one not refurbished but used, for the reason is that the warranty label was already torn WOW!!!!!!!! that is shady at its finest, if you like throwing your money away go here, buyer beware!<//Text>

<Name>Misia Saison</Name><date>1592460477454<//date><rating>5< /rating><text>Mario, David and Alex were all great. Super helpful and the price of installing an aftermarket radio was fair. They did it in a day. They cautioned me that in 75% of off-brand stereos the steering wheel does not work. They made it work! They installed a back-up camera. They paid attention to details and my requests and instructions. They dealt with all the complexities of a non-major brand stereo that they do not sell or normally install in my 2007 Honda Odyssey. It really was a terrific experience. Highly recommend!<//text>< Pictures>

Installer at Sound Waves Damaged my car , the wiring was a mess, multiple error messages and the radio did not work. Further when I asked for my money back they refused to refund my money ($2000) in total. BEWARE THEY MAY DAMAGE YOUR CAR AS WELL!</Text>

Nope! Had a horrible experience here.
Turns out when the boss is away the mice will play.
My husband was returning for a second time same service. My husband had called ahead to schedule an appointment they scheduled him and confirmed a price over the phone it coincided with the last price he paid last time for the same service. Upon arriving day of scheduled apt the price not only doubles... but the two men were speaking in Spanish and thought my husband was none the wise to what they were saying but he does understand and speak Spanish. What they said may shock you: One asked “How much do I charge him?” The other responds “ $500 he’ll pay!” To which the other guy turns and says “Your total is $550”. Although same service last time cost $320.
I told one of the workers that I have receipt last time I paid $320 same service- that guy said “go get it”. And the other guy said “No I do not care it’s $550”
Asked to speak to manager or owner and they said they will come back next month- on vacation.

Be careful- get quotes in writing. Do you don’t waste your time dealing with crooks that don’t appreciate return clientele.

If your wondering my recommendation: Found this same service half a price ($245) at California Car Audio- they were very nice and appreciative of my business. They actually did 10x more esthetically pleasing job job within the same day for me.

If you want to see pic/ proof of invoices go to read my yelp review.<//text>

<Text>The best place for all your car electronic needs and beyond that. The place is ran by a very sincere gentleman and all his employees know what they’re doing and they pay attention to small detail when upgrading your car without you having to mention anything. Will definitely come back in the future for more upgrades to my camaro!< /Text>< Rate>

These guys did a great job installing my new kickers in 93' j30! They even fixed my window that no longer holds it's own weight by drilling a bar inside. Sound waves also made a custom bracket to fit bigger speakers in my front two doors for free! I'll be going back for a subwoofer for sure.< /review>

I went into the store looking to upgrade my 2014 Ram's stock, lowest-of-the-line radio, and maybe get speakers. I have a receiver in mind, but Alex listened to my wants and recommended the perfect receiver and speakers for me. All the features that I want, with no bloat I don't care about. The install was on schedule and I was very happy with it.

I had an issue that the backup camera stopped working about 2 months later. Sound Waves fixed it immediately, no questions asked. I will definitely come back to these guys for any future car audio needs.

Thanks for the great support Alex and James!< /review>

This place is the epitome of great customer service! I had a backup camera installed more than three years ago but lost the receipt. Went in and they agreed to check it out while they were installing my wheel controls. I was fully expecting them to come back and tell me the backup camera was broken but to my surprise they said it was a faulty connection and they replaced the wire for free. That is as honest as you can get, since I was already in the process of reading the reviews of the backup cameras they had on display.

That is excellent service and not only that, they value your time and do a good job. I’ll always be coming here for these type of car needs, they can’t be beat!<//Text>

<Text>I just went in this morning and I'm so happy and satisfied with the product and service I received.

When I went in, Mario assisted me right away.  He asked what I was looking for and I told him I wanted the most basic and simple stereo to replace the current one in my car.  He asked the right questions, ones that I didn't even think about such as if I wanted Bluetooth capability, etc.

He didn't waste my time trying to up sell me or anything which I totally appreciated because I did not want to invest in all of the bells and whistles at this time.  He had the stereo installed in around 30 minutes.  The whole trip (discussion, installation, and payment) was definitely under an hour.

Prices for the stereo and installation were fair.  I would highly recommend this store for all your car stereo needs.  I will definitely go back if I ever need anything else.</Text><Rating>5</Rating>< user_id>

<Text>It took us a while to find this place. We were hesitant about aftermarket work... but needed an alarm system since our truck had been broken into 2 nights in a row. What a relief to find Alex and his team. So professional. He knows his products, and helps you find the right one for you. There's no over selling or price gouging. He gives you the best price and price matches. Mario did the install. We LOVE our system! It was done right and done on time. We were so happy that we went back with confidence to have them install a new stereo system too. We had the same experience. Alex's customer service is outstanding. In everything he does you can see his concern for his customer. We needed some adjustments on a few things with our system and Alex was right there, without hesitation to make everything perfect without question. If you have any aftermarket needs for your vehicle go see Alex. You will not regret it for a second! Thank you Alex... we will never go anywhere else!<//Text>< user_id>

Did you hear this one? "We recommend that you install the bypass, otherwise the unit might only work when you are parked (about Android Auto head unit without DVD)". That's bad enough, but it followed an incorrect installation of the unit where it would not recognized the car as parked and could not finish the set up steps. Whenever the owner (I assume) enters the shop he asks you to explain your request, totally ignoring the fact you have explained it already, and people are working on it. They accept Installnet contacts, but then make you feel responsible that they are getting paid less, and use tricks to extract installation upgrades.</text>

<review>They can do the work you asked, but the price is a rip off.

They do price match for the product (infotainment system, speakers, DVR, etc.) only, but NOT for the wires. They charge wires at 2 - 5 times more expensive than the market.

In my case, I asked them to change the stereo system and purchase necessary wires there. Those wires cost less than $80 from Amazon but they charged $200. When I asked them about this, they said they can put everything back to factory setting and only charge me $180 of labor, take it or leave it.

If you want to let them help you, make sure you do the research and double check the price before they start working.<//review></record></dataset><record>

They price match Amazon! Excellent customer service, reasonable prices, and they even stayed open later to install my new stereo! I would recommend them to meet your music needs!</Text>

Gave me a great deal on a car stereo, did a less than stellar job on the installation, or at least the first guy did. When I went back to have them fix it, a different installer did a solid job.<//Text>

They did an out standing job!!! They saved me 2 hundred dollars because they fixed the wires that a different place broke wile bolting down my sub, also I didn't know my trunk was missing a bolt and they fixed it for free, then when I got it back my sound cut out wile driving sometimes so I took it back and they checked all my wires and found the problem for free!< /Review>

I recently had Sound Waves install a Audio/GPS/Bluetooth system and they truly did a great job. They matched the unit with speakers, GPS antenna, and mic for BT hands free calling and all works as it should!</text>

Our wedding was from this hall on May 6th, and I am so glad my family and I chose this venue! It's absolutely beautiful and brand new! My wedding day was magical. Paul's service is the best, he tried his best to accommodate my families needs and he made sure my wedding day was perfect. The service is awesome! Thank you once again and look forward to working with you again!<//text>

< Review>
By far, this is the most elegant and exquisite banquet hall in all of the Sacramento. I recently had my wedding reception at this venue and prior to that, my engagement ceremony was at the Florin location. However, the new venue was exactly what I was looking for to accommodate all my guests for my wedding reception. The hall itself is spectacular & spacious, with high ceilings and stunning chandeliers. I received a 5-star venue for an affordable price.

The service was also 5-star. Pardeep stayed at our wedding reception the entire night to ensure that our event was a success, and it was. He was friendly, receptive to our needs, and very flexible. It is hard to find such caring owners that remain hands on during functions. Pardeep and his staff went above and beyond my expectations. I would definitely continue doing business with Pardeep at Flamingo Palace Banquet Hall.<//Review>

I want to take this time to thank Paul Sharma and his crew for providing a wonderful service for our event at this location. It was our daughter's engagement. We contacted Paul and from day one he was very helpful in providing all information and guided us through and on the final day he was there himself with all crew members. The food was delicious and he gave all that he promised. It has been two days from the event, December 19th and we have been receiving compliments on the service. We loved this service so much that we would recommend anyone who is looking for a great service for their event. Thank you Paul Sharma!!< /Text>

Called for a quote to paint a car I'm selling. He was honest and upfront that he'd be doing it right and wasn't worth me dumping what he'd need to charge to do it and that I'd be better off discounting the price tag and being done with it. Appreciate his honesty as some shops would talk up painting to get more from buyer. Thank you!!!<//text>

They finished a day ahead of time and the work was immaculate. They made the car look brand new again, and I couldn't be happier with the quality of work and friendly customer service. My car has a three stage pearl white and they matched it spot on. Cesar and his team are awesome! Thank you!</Text>

Cesar took great care of me and my truck- ran down all of my repair options, finished a day early, touched up some random chips, then washed my truck and even vacuumed the cab.
He cares about doing a good job.

I hope to never need them again, but 661 is where I'll go if I do.</Review>

<review>We took our Mercedes 2017 GLS 450 here and Wow!!! My rear bumper was fixed on time, they were very reasonable, the work was excellent, and up to par with MB lease return. What I loved the most,  Body Shop 661  returned my car without  a spec of dust inside and out. They detailed my car so well it looked brand new!!! I would highly recommend. Very professional and they go the extra mile for you.< /review><gmapID>0x80c287cdebad6e6d:0x1492d8f2d64f4dab<//gmapID></record>

<review>Cesar, the owner, did an amazing job fixing some scratches and dents in our car door. Not only were his prices better than the competitors, his quality and integrity are unmatched. He even charged us less than quoted since he said the job was a little easier than expected. Other body shops wanted to replace the door. We can’t even tell there was previous damage, the paint match is impeccable. Thanks!</review></record></dataset><record>

I have been taking my car to Body Shop 661 for years now! Cesar and his crew provide affordable quality work that has always been top notch. They have matched my paint perfectly, fixed dents, scratches, amongst other things. They get the job done in a timely matter which is very important.  The whole staff is delightful and full of smiles which makes coming here pleasant. I highly recommend taking your vehicle here for ANY job small or large!</Text>

They are the best ever and have helped me out multiple times! I’ve been going here for years and this is the only place I trust to go to when I need body shop work done. In comparison to other shops Body Shop 661 is always the cheapest and best quality at the same time. Cesar even helped my mom out as well. Cesar is excellent across all levels: excellent customer service, great quality auto body work, very good pricing deals, and he even spoke to my insurance company and helped with my whole claim process! He also hooked me up with a really good deal on a rental car! A plus and 10/10 across the board!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Awesome job guys, thank you much. Job looks great, paint match was perfect on my Volvo S90. The price was totally affordable. I will be back for some touch up work on my other car. Thanks!!!!

Cesar was very professional. Gave me a great deal! Fast reliable service. He went above and beyond even helping me with transportation from the rental car return back to the shop! My jeep came back looking like it had never been in an accident. Cesar gets two thumbs up from me!< /Review>

From a minor ding to major damage, a random part you may need for your car, or a high quality and/or super cool paint job, this is the shop to go to!
Cesar is always friendly and willing to work around his customers, and wants them leaving happy.
I've taken my cars to Cesar over the years and never worried once that I'm going to get "screwed over" with an outrageous bill.< /Review>

I have had many great experiences personally and have also sent quite a few of clients to Bodyshop 661 to share those experiences as well. Very knowledgeable, friendly and fairly priced. He is great at completing the job in the time frame he tells you. Highly recommended!</Review>

Cesar is the MOST honest car guy I’ve ever used- his network of trusted mechanics are also beyond incredible! He has saved our cars on more than one occasion and ALWAYS for fair pricing! (More than fair, in my opinion)
He is our car angel!</text>

Honestly I wouldn’t go anywhere else for your body shop needs! I’ve been here multiple times over the years. The Owner Cesar is hands down the best and most helpful person ever! He goes above and beyond!! His staff is also very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend Bodyshop661

Caesar was really helpful, very good pricing as well :) I have always gone to him for my car whatever I needed and he would explain to me in detail and show me images of what he will be doing to fix whatever it is :) I love it!

Cesar and his team did body work on my Toyota Highlander and painted my 7.3L diesel Ford Excursion. They go the extra mile... made them look like they could be entered in a showroom competition! Over the years I've had work done at other body shops since I've been driving for many decades. I'll never go anywhere else. I have recommended Cesar to many of my friends. They have all thanked me for referring them to BodyShop661.< /Text>

Cesar and his team were professional and quick - their price was just right and they are a certified bodyshop for all reputable insurance companies. His team did wonders to my ride when I was rear ended on the freeway. I think it looks better than it did before I got in an accident.<//Text>

I've actually had the pleasure of getting my Porsche Boxster worked on here when someone backed into it sideways in a parking lot. I will say that the quality came out great and was finished in a quick and timely manner. Casar is an honest guy who will get straight to the point and provide an exact quote.</Review>

<text>I brought in my vehicle to have the back bumper fixed. Cesar was courteous, personable, and so on point. He made all the necessary calls to the insurance reps and made the whole process so easy. When I returned to pick up my car not only was the work on the bumper great, but I was delighted to see that the body shop had not only washed my car but took the time to remove tree sap that two car wash locations refused to work on. I appreciate your time and professionalism! Highly recommended!<//text>< Pictures>

Cesar and his family-owned business has been servicing our cars for decades. It’s so nice to have a trusted person to go to for repairs. It is businesses like this, that have been around for generations, that make up the tread of the SCV community.<//Review>

I was referred to Cesar and his team at Body Shop 661, and they were so helpful from the first time meeting for an estimate, to the point of delivering my car. The work they did for me was incredible, my car looks brand new again, and what I'm more impressed with is their integrity, honesty, and knowledge about the process. I was fully explained details that I didn't even ask about because they wanted to make sure I knew what to expect and what it takes to turn out a great finished product. They also finished earlier than expected which was nice as it saved me $ on my rental car. If you need a body shop in the Santa Clarita Valley or neighboring areas, don't hesitate to give Cesar a call for a great overall experience.< /review>

<Review>It can be a very stressful situation during and after any traffic collision. This is why my family and I have always trusted Bodyshop661. Cesar and his team literally handled everything from towing my car to the shop, obtaining a rental car (same day), and keeping me updated with the repairs. Bodyshop661 has always looked out for my best interest. This is why I would easily recommend Bodyshop661 to anyone in the Santa Clarita valley and San Fernando Valley.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Bodyshop 661 was recommended to me through 2 different people and when I met Cesar, I could tell he would put care and quality into his work. When I picked up my Jeep you couldn’t even tell anything had happened to it. Bodyshop661 even cleaned and waxed it and it looked as if I had just bought a new Jeep from the dealership!

BodyShop661 is the best body shop in SCV! My car was hit on a Monday morning at Costco. I called AAA and BodyShop661 immediately. Together they got my car repair approved and BodyShop661 had back to me by that Friday! I was amazed how quickly Cesar and the guys were able to fix my car. You cant even tell anything happened! They are nothing but phenomenal. I will forever recommend them to all of my friends and family.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The sandwiches are not the most delicious The raw materials are partly not very fresh and therefore lose their flavor. The rolls are soft and not crunchy and it lowers the taste of the bread. Do not recommend !!!

(Original)
הסנדוויצים לא הכי טעימים חומרי הגלם בחלקם לא ממש טרי ולכן מאבדים מהטעם. הלחמניות רכות ולא קראנצ'י וזה מוריד מהטעימות של הלחם. לא ממליץ !!!</review>

<date>1601495625454< /date><rating>2</rating><text>1 * for selections: there are many selections and styles.
1* for competitive prices: if you can't afford  a wig you like, this place does offer alternatives and there is something you can find and will fit your Budget.
0* star for friendliness: they were not welcoming and no people skills in communication (they came off as rude and judgmental to me.)
0* star for Assistance: if they offered assistance the way they offer watching you and peeking at you it would be great!
0* star for recommendations: I would not recommend to friends to shop here.
Tip: if you do decide to come shop and you purchase an item that requires them to go to the back and get it * MAKE SURE TO CHECK THAT THE ITEM YOU ASKED FOR IS THE ITEM THAT YOU ARE RECEIVING BEFORE PURCHASING IT OR YOUR STUCK WITH WHATEVER THEY BROUGHT YOU OUT!
BECAUSE NOW☝️ YOU'VE ALREADY PAID FOR IT!!!!<//text>< pics>

<review>Terrible service! Walked around the store for over 15 minutes, looking at wigs. Asked for help and was simply pointed in the direction as a man, and 2 woman that worked there stood behind the counter. Would never spend my money in this place.<//review>< Pictures>

My experience was awful with the Owner Peter Kim.  I have purchased hair for approximately one year at this place and on 1/5/13 I tried a different brand of hair. less than three weeks later the human hair was poor , shedding and couldn't sustain any style other than a hot mess.  I return to request to be given more hair and the owner (poor customer service) response was prove it's the hair. WHAT!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS! I presented my receipt and the hair in adition to the fact that the same person does my hair each time, it has to be the hair.  His response as he rudely walked away is there is nothing I can do. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Next complaint to the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Affairs and my CREDIT CARD COMPANY!<//text>

<review>I was in town visiting my family, and I heard that HSC was a fantastic gym.  See, I’m from Los Angeles and workout at Nerdstrong Gym. HSC seemed to offer similar programming with a nerd atmosphere, and I wanted to be there.
I was pleasantly surprised to find that they do indeed have a very happy, welcoming and nerd-tasting atmosphere.  Their equipment is great, their coaching staff extremely knowledgeable, and Austin the owner is just down to earth, funny, and easy to be around. It was easy to see how that attitude carried across to his staff and his membership.
My favorite part? When a new person comes in for a class,  a coach works with them that first day. I signed up for Olympic Weightlifting, and Kolin the Coach helped me work on the Snatch, which is always been tricky for me in general.  It was a pleasure to work with him as he broke down the movements, and he paid attention to my knee, which has been tricky lately. It’s just the kind of experience I get at Nerdstrong, and I was over the moon to get this experience at HSC. I highly recommend them for anyone pursuing fitness on any level.  Can’t wait to see them again the next time I’m in town.</review>< userid>

HSC is awesome and has been a lifesaver during the COVID pandemic. The gym gives me a place to lift heavy weights (I don't have a barbell and plates at home!) and focus on improving my health and fitness. My trainer (Nick) is super knowledgeable, patient, and encouraging, and he's excellent at putting together a weekly program that challenges me at just the right difficulty level and pace.< /Review>

<Review>This gym is awesome! All levels are welcome!! The owner and staff welcome you with open arms; so there’s no need to be afraid! Each coach is experienced and very knowledgeable; so you don’t need to worry about getting injured. I know it’s super intimidating sometimes getting back into the workout flow, but everyone is super helpful! There are different classes from conditioning to strength and the coaches will breakdown each and every workout planned. If you’re looking for a gym that feels like a family, this is the place to be!! Highly recommend this gym!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I've been going here since the beginning of this year and I have to say, this is by far THE best gym I've ever been to. The staff is super friendly and very supportive. The vibe here is amazing and you can really tell that the HSC team is a family.

I went with the one on one option for training and it has been life changing. Before, I was working out, having a good time, and seeing results but then I plateaued and stayed there. Once Anthony finally got me in the gym, it was a done deal! This is easily the most healthy and athletic I've been in my life! I can't wait for what the future has in store for my fitness journey!

Lastly, If you're a nerd like me. This place is for you. I can nerd out with basically everyone here and not be judged for it!<//Review>

This is such a great facility. They offer body scans that really hone in on things that your standard scale won't tell you. The conditioning classes are challenging, and after a little over a month, I've already noticed an increase in my energy, strength, and stamina. Everyone here is personable and knowledgeable. If you're looking for a supportive environment for your fitness journey, I highly recommend HSC.< /Review>

Coach Ivy is one of the most genuine, fun, energetic human beings you'll ever meet. If you want to be trained by someone who will motivate you, give you a personalized experience, and make time for you, look no further. Ivy is booked out for a reason- She gives people a transformative workout that will help you reach whatever goals you may have.

She really takes the time to listen, assess your needs, and make a plan that will work out with your schedule. She has years of knowledge and fitness experience under her belt. Despite only seeing her  a few times a week, I've already made a huge amount of progress on my lifting and my body composition.

It's always intimidating stepping foot into a foreign gym where you don't know the people or how to use the equipment. Ivy makes this process so much easier and less intimidating- I felt so comfortable with her! I highly recommend Ivy if you're looking for trainer who knowledgable and will help you throughout your fitness journey every step of the way.< /text>

As a person who enjoys exercising in a social gym setting, the cancellation of all my in-person classes was a hard pill to swallow. HSC quickly set up a SIP Zoom weekly schedule and got everyone right back into the workout groove.  Austin is powerhouse producing workout-from-home video content, launching challenges, sharing healthy eating resources and creating virtual gatherings, keeping the community active and engaged and welcoming both HSC members and non-members on this quarantine journey.

The best thing that I can do for myself during these times is to have full control over my physical health and HSC is hand in hand helping me with that, helping me set healthy goals and elevating my sanity level.  I cannot thank the team enough for their support during these times and would highly recommend HSC to anyone who wants to up their health and lifestyle game.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808fcc653fb0c451:0x41ef0330cb5d907f<//Gmap_id><Name>Jasmine Lu</Name>< UserId.>

I've been training with Coach Austin since 2010 at another gym. A lot has happened in 8 years, he got his own gym, I moved an hour and a half away from SJ. But I will still go to him for a session when I can even though it is really out of the way.

The thing that I love about this place is that Austin knows how to make a community, and make each person that trains with him feel that they can achieve their goals. That's what makes me always come back. I have never known a coach as dedicated, hardworking, and selfless.

The facility is a geeks dream. I love that it's almost like a playground of fun. Their staff are so accommodating and helpful (thanks Micah for always finding the expo markers for me!)

Thanks Austin and staff for everything!< /Text>

Austin's style of coaching is very versatile and well tailored to each individual's fitness goals. I had a chance to try out the weight lifting class and the conditioning class, which I both enjoyed even as a beginner. Each day there are different circuits to keep classes fun and interesting. In addition, Austin offers modifications for different levels to ensure each member's needs are met. In other words, you won't ever feel intimidated because the exercises are too hard.

It's easy to get hooked on going to this gym because there's a strong team mentality, where members continuously push one another to do better. It's all about improvement and everyone sincerely wants you to succeed. If I ever move back to San Jose, I will be sure to become a member here again.<//text>< Pics>

His energy is always at a 10, always upbeat, and his motivational skills are second to none (If you ever hit a PR around him you'll see what I mean). And he's instilled all of that into the environment at HSC!

The facility is clean, organized and intimate, the coaches can see all the members at all times to help with correct form and answer any questions before, during, and after workouts. The equipment is great, clean, and always organized as well! #1 Gym Pet Peeve is when weights get left everywhere scrambled, that won't be the case here.

I suggest whoever is reading this to do the same as I did and let Coach Austin and his team help you become the best version of yourself with their passion for fitness. I can speak for a lot of people one more time when i say, I can't thank him enough!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I started coming here last year May 2016 and didn't know what to expect.  I am actually intimidated by gyms once I see all the muscle peeps weight lifting and showing off their workout.  First time I walked inside Austin's gym for a trial membership, everyone was very helpful and welcoming.  There were no pressure or someone calling your phone almost every damn day and bugging you to sign up from Austin's staff which I appreciated very much.  The gym is small in size,  cozy, and introvert friendly which was a plus for me!  You have the option to take conditioning classes or weight lifting programs that are taught by Austin and his staff.   I've been taking the conditioning class due to some nagging beach volleyball related injuries and working my way up to weight lifting in the near future.  I am also taking it for to get in shape.
So far I had lost 20lbs (with the workouts installed by Austin and proper nutrition) and still working on losing more.  Every member here are super cool to work out with and also very helpful.  The classes are always challenging and pushes you to your limits.  You will never feel alone or abandoned.  They will encourage you to push yourself.   I definitely recommend Hyper Strength and Conditioning to all the underdogs out there.  This is the only gym that I joined that makes me feel appreciated for all my hard work.  Come and check it out!<//text>

<review>HSC is one of those gyms that you never really leave because it a familiar environment. Talk to anyone there and you will be surprised just how motivated they are. Classes are fun of course, but they are geared to make the best out of the time you are there. Training here is focused and exciting.

The instructors take their time with each individual. They remember your name! Coach Austin listens, observes and promotes your personal growth through encouraging exercise routines that you don't find at your typical aquarium strip mall gyms. If you are looking for gains, you will find them here and you will find individuals who want to excel just as much as you.

You should give HSC an opportunity to help you develop, grow and get buff.< /review>< Pictures>

I've been coming here for a few years and it's one of the best decisions I've made. Since joining, I broke out of my comfort zone and lost over 40 pounds. (and kept it off too!) The atmosphere at the gym is extremely friendly and the energy from the members is electrifying.< /Text>

I can't say enough about the atmosphere here. Whether you're a newcomer, a veteran, somebody who's skipped in months, or somebody who goes every day, the sense of camaraderie displayed in each of this gym's classes is second to none. Featured in Men's Health, Coach Toloza is one of the best in the business and while he can be training avengers and guardians, he takes the time to teach the basics and more advanced techniques to people around the greater community, young or old. I can't recommend this gym enough!<//Text>

To put into perspective of how much HSC means to me and why it’s worth it: I drive a roundtrip of 60 miles to go to San Jose and spend a small part of my day at HSC not only to physically enrich my body, but the mind as well. When you make meaningful, life-long connections at a place (in this case, HSC), it’s difficult to just come in and use equipment and do your routine and call it a day. No, that’s not the only purpose of HSC. At HSC, you make and build connections just as much as you make and build your PRs and routines. As the name suggests, HSC houses energy like no other (“hyper”). I come in and get drawn by the energy of new people from all walks of life and see familiar faces and smiles. The “hyper” to me signifies an unconditional and unassuming enthusiasm from coaches to inspire their members to give their training the utmost best and mindful care. The “strength and conditioning” just speak for themselves, as proven by all the unique classes they offer to foster functional training, weightlifting, and many more. I mainly do personal training with Coach Kilo and she has gone above and beyond to surpass my ever-changing fitness goals. Creativity and mindfulness come into her workouts. HSC is family. HSC is one of my homes away from home. Just like a family, we have fun gatherings, as a reminder that strength and health are not one-dimensional, but dynamic and holistic. HSC summons fun and grit in the physical core but reveres the importance of the mind and what it means to live a purposeful and meaningful, active lifestyle. Just recently, they’ve helped me achieve a dream of an opportunity by training me to compete on American Ninja Warrior Season 11! It was in this instance of their unwavering support and energy that I felt like I was at home with family on the day of the competition. It was an effort on their part that I will remember for the rest of my life. I can’t thank them enough. I’ve been driving to SJ for HSC (for 2 years now) not just to escape the hustle and bustle of life but to train to endure the so-called “hustle and bustle” of life. As a nurse, it’s important for me to stay physically and mentally strong and to avoid injury that the labor of the profession often is at risk for. When you want to go that extra 60 miles to attain fitness goals (even when people question the worthiness when they realize the length I go to for exercise) then the blood, sweat, and tears (happy!) are nothing but the product of something worthy and of high caliber! I am HSC (hella so confidently, LOL) Proud!</text>

<review>I have been going here since February 2019. This gym is simply awesome. This gym is a bit smaller than what you would expect from a large commercial gym, but what you get here is an experience that you simply cannot get anywhere else. What this gym lacks in floor size, machines, and treadmills, it makes up for with its quality equipment, excellent staff, culture, and community. Because it is a smaller gym, you never feel overwhelmed with interrupting typical gymbros who don't want to let you share a machine, bench, equipment, weights, etc. If you are into power or olympic weightlifting, this gym has all the equipment you could ever need. This gym offers a variety of fun classes for its members taught by passionate trainers who truly put in the effort to maximize your potential. Classes range from conditioning, powerlifting, kickboxing, yoga, and olympic weightlifting. If you want to pay extra for personal training, HSC offers some of the best in the business. Also, you can workout by yourself, but I definitely recommend trying a class here. Whatever your fitness goals are, HSC will help you get there. No matter your fitness level, all are truly welcome here.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Whether you're a beginner and never went to the gym before or a super athlete that wants to train for American Ninja Warrior or Crossfit tournaments--this is the place (also people in between who is looking to workout during the work week).

I've been working out with Austin, the owner, for close to 10 years. So when he finally reached a goal of opening his own gym I became a member and it's been a fun ride ever since HSC opened.
Personally I've dropped close to 30 pounds over the course of a year and a half. Then again I'm here about 20 hours a week. I'm not saying you have to be here that much but it's definitely not boring. Austin and the staff vary the workouts and classes so you don get tired or bored of the same routine.< /review>

<review>I have wanted to get into powerlifting for as long as I can remember but never had the confidence to even try. The first time i stepped foot in HSC, everyone was so nice and welcoming. The coaches were supportive and helped me lesrn the basics. I am now one week out from my 3rd powerlifting meet this year and there's no freakin way I would be where i am now without the team at HSC. From teaching me the basics, to tweaking technique, programming, and recovery. I love this place. Plus, key card access after hours!!<//review>< response>

< Review>
Over the past 5 months, HSC has become "my gym". I feel like part of a not-so-little family here where everybody fist bumps you to say hi and people yell out your name excitedly when you walk in the door. My own family doesn't even get that excited to see me.

Comparing my experience here to tons of studios and commercial gyms I've been to, staff + members + events = amazing community.

STAFF
Austin (the owner) teaches some mean cardio and boxing classes to get you in shape where I almost passed out the first time I went. Ivy will kick your butt in a$$ class and then spend time helping you individually to correct your pull-up form. Kim does all things powerlifting and will hold you to the highest standard as she cheers you on when you bench more than you thought you could. Tim does all things Olympic weightlifting and super patiently tells you time and time again how you need to stop holding the barbell like you're about to mic drop. Myra is the in-house physical therapist and does a weekly stretching class that helps your muscles release through a series of challenging movements (no laying around here!). Plus Arthur, Jessie, Kolin, and the rest of the staff who do an amazing job supporting members and making sure HSC is running smoothly.

All of this matters because I've been to studios where I got yelled at for not following/understanding the instructor's direction. (Thankfully, Tim never yells at me for misreading BTN as "below the knee" and not "below the neck".  -_- ) If you're serious about improving in something, a coach will help put together a customized plan for you. There's even a Facebook group where the coaches do weekly check-ins!

MEMBERS
People actually made an effort to introduce themselves and say hi. I progressed in large part to both getting help and tips from other members and being inspired by watching the gains that everyone else was making. Knowing that I'll be seeing the same set of people 3x a week makes me feel accountable in actually showing up to the gym consistently.

EVENTS
There was an Olympic lifting meet in East Bay recently, and it was awesome to see so many members of the gym show up to support other members who had been training for months to compete for the first time. HSC even held a mock powerlifting meet to help beginners feel good about competing! On top of just meets, HSC hosts holiday parties and tons of social events throughout the year.

A friend tried to convince me to join Equinox (hello, Eucalyptus towels!), but when I went, nobody was there to correct my form or made sure I knew what I was doing. Nobody was chatting between sets about random stuff like the best way to tie up long hair. At the end of the day, no amount of Kiehl's products can replace the community here.< /Review>

Hyper Strength is a family friendly gym that provides a supportive and uplifting environment for athletes whether beginner or national level competitors to thrive in. Its not your average crossfit gym nor commercial gym. HSC offers a wide range of conditioning classes including boxing and weightlifting. Private one on one personal training is available as well.

Equipment is in perfect condition; the gym is spot clean and well-kept. HSC has plenty of weightlifting barbells, powerlifting barbells, bumper plates, and free weights. The staff are all incredibly friendly and welcoming. The coaches are knowledgable, clearly passionate about what they teach.

Both gym hours and monthly price are convenient for college students such as myself since my classes usually end by noon. I started going to HSC in September and I’ve already dropped 3% body fat and gained 3 lbs of lean mass. I feel so motivated and welcomed at HSC. I couldn’t imagine lifting anywhere else.

Highly recommend checking this place out if you’re sick of commercial gyms or crossfit cults.</Text>

<text>I never power lifted before coming here and now I love it! The atmosphere is awesome and super welcoming. It's also very motivational as people cheer you on after a good lift!

I mainly take the powerlifting classes because I get out of work late. As a beginner, they show you the basics on the three major lifts (squats, bench and deadlift) and how to have proper form, breathing and etc.

I've done the conditioning classes and boy.. they really work you out! It's cool though also because I've learned some very fun exercises from different coaches. It's great to attend the classes especially when you don't really have time to make your own work out.

I've definitely gotten stronger after working out here and I plan to surpass more expectations</text><rating>5<//rating><date>1495201064923</date>< name>

<text>HSC Rocks! I have been working out at HSC for 7 months and it is awesome. I’ve known Coach Austin since High school and I am happy to see he has followed his dream with opening his own gym. Hard work done right!

HSP is a friendly, positive, and inspiring atmosphere & The coaches are knowledgeable and always available when I am confused with a workout move or need some assistance with achieving the next step with my goal.

HSC is always mixing it up with their workouts and events. It is so fun! Some of the fun workouts/events are archery, dance classes, kickball, sword fighting, etc. I always feel motivated when I arrive to the gym and in return, I’ve gained great results and fun memories. I’d recommend HSC - Open for all ages and all goals.< /text>< date>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Having met the head coach/gym owner Austin before HSC, I came into the gym when it started, hoping for the best. I had known him to be an amazing conditioning coach and he was the one who fostered my love of powerlifting.

The gym is nearing its second year in a couple months and I can truly say my expectations have been completely blown out of the water. On the powerlifting side, I have had several coaches mentor me at HSC. I've watched my lift totals rise higher and higher. On the conditioning side, I've had coaches teach me to love the intensity of it all. Conditioning classes are never boring and I've always felt challenged.

Classes aside, what I find to be the best quality of this gym is the community. In every class, there's a sense of camaraderie. We cheer each other on through each set or each lap. When I'm tired and want to sleep after a long work day and commute, knowing that I have a group of friends and coaches at the gym helps motivate me to come in.

So if you're looking for a gym full of qualified trainers to help you reach your goals and members to cheer you on and work out alongside you, come check out HSC!!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>I was referred to HSC by coworkers and after witnessing a few of the members go through their first powerlifting meet, observing the support of other HSC members and Coach Austin's enthusiasm; I was motivated to check out the gym and brought my fiancé along. Although, I was worried about the cost of membership, my fiancé and I joined after experiencing a few classes! We considered this to be a great investment in continuing our healthy lifestyle.

It was not only the classes that got us hooked, but the overall atmosphere. All coaches, staff, and members are very welcoming and there is a huge comradery among everyone. In my short few months there, I have been challenged by trying new sports, exercises and joining gym challenges to enable healthy habits daily. Coach Austin and staff also create creative ways to keep members active and accountable even outside of the gym. They care about your progress/goals and you feel motivated to put in the work as well.

Also, if you are someone who has trouble coming up with your own workout to do at a commercial gym, then this place may be for you. There is already a workout established for you with no thinking required. You put on a good sweat, challenge your body's capabilities and have fun doing it! I say, even if you are a bit curious, come through and check the gym out, take a couple classes and go from there... though, I think you'll agree that you'll want to stay and join the rest of us who love coming here!

So, for all beginning and experienced lifters, non-lifters, and you want to take your next step towards healthy living habits, come by and check it out! In addition, if you are an aspiring powerlifter, or want to learn fundamentals in olympic lifting...I would highly recommend coming here for all the newbies to these sports.< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1495597430210, 'text': 'Sheila!

I have to say that the sales and service team treat you right. They dont try to upsell you on stuff you dont need. COVID has impacted the time it takes to get your windows, but once they arrived they were installed within 2 weeks. Richard and Tony are the best installers. Polite, courteous, and super hard working. These guys did an amazing job. Thanks to Miller Glass, especially Richard and Tony, for taking my windows from trash to flash!<//Text>

<review>I took my Jeep Cherokee and have a windshield.when I picked it up they explained to me that due to the extensive rusting around the window that they had to sand it down and primer it and they couldn't give me a warranty for the windshield. A month later I finally washed it they did an absolutely wonderful job it did not leak not one drop. I just want to say, if you ever need a windshield Miller Glass is a place to take. And on top of  it all, they were more than on the price for the replacement of windshield.</review><gmapID>0x808327b248e0e835:0xaf2411357a59211e</gmapID>< date>

<Text>I ordered 2 replacement dual pane windows as the originals leaked. This happened early March 2020. Got a quote from them to show clear glass and low e. I ordered Low e, and paid for materials. When they installed they used clear. If I had not questioned the installer they would have charged full price for low e. They ordered and installed the wrong glass and not even an apology. I do not recommend this company. Dana
4/10/2020. I did receive calls to apologize and make it right. My nephew let them in and the windows were replaced with the low e type as originally ordered. So I appreciate making it right. Thanks< /Text>< pictures>

You should have been given an accurate lead time for installation and a correct price for the project when quoted. You stated the windows leak water. If you would please reach out to me I would like to review the installation personally and get these issues solved for you. The last thing I want is for damage to occur to your home from water infiltration.

Extremely dissatisfied.  We were graciously welcomed and quoted and taken care of: a facade.  The windows took much longer than they said they would, they leak water, they quoted us reasonably but the price ended up being much more.  They did not check the quality of their work: did the absolute bare minimum, and I will never take my business to Miller Glass ever again.<//Text>

I deal with Miller occasionally for work (carpenter) , but this morning i walked out and found my ram truck window smashed in and some tools stolen. Originally geico tried to get me to use safelite ( and wait 9 days with a broken window), so out of curiousity I called Miller up and found out that yes they do autoglass! So i told geico Im taking it to Miller, geico sent the paperwork and Miller had the glass in stock, so within 45 minutes of me finding the damage they were working on it! Finished same day and did a great job! Im tempted to have the other windows done since the new one is so clear and they were so easy to deal with. I didnt even need to fight with plastic and all the b.s. of having a broken window. Thanks Much Folks!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Sep,

I wanted to write you an email to let you know how incredibly happy I am with my purchase from Miller Glass. The windows are better than expected and show an immediate savings in energy consumption. Richard was extremely professional, clean, and thorough.

I will definitely be suggesting Miller Glass to my friends and family.

I wish you and your team a Merry Christmas. Thank you.<//review>< Pictures>

After a stray rock broke a window in our beautiful front door, and we were told by the door seller that the window could not be repaired, we called Miller Glass. For an extremely reasonable price, a new piece of glass was ordered and, a week later, installed by the very talented and knowledgeable Steve. Not only did he not break the other 2 panes of glass (as the man who gave us an estimate warned could happen) but he was able to remove the trim and replace it with such minimal stress to the pieces that you'd have to KNOW the window was broken and replaced to notice the small blemishes left by the repairs. We have use Miller Glass many times in the past, mainly for screens and car glass, and they have ALWAYS exceeded our expectations both on price and quality of service! Thank you!< /Text>

I have used Miller glass for new windows on several different rental properties with great results.  I was surprised the first time I called them for quotes because they gave me a quote on really nice quality windows and they were cheaper than the big box store prices.

On one batch I installed the windows myself, but they came and measured everything for me to make sure that was all correct.  Then on another property, they installed the windows and make short work of with a nice job.

Now, I just call Miller Glass whenever I need anything because I know I will get good service and a good price.</Text>

Best price I could find anywhere !I had broke my windshield on a Sunday. I called Miller Glass on Monday and set up a appointment at 8 AM the next morning. They said it would be all day I would be able to pick it up at 4 PM. When I got there they told me they would call me as soon as it was dry. They seen l had my bike and had to ride around town until it was done.. What a great town, I found a nice easy ride up the river trail. At 11 AM they called and said it was done and I could pick it up at noon.. I got there it was ready and I loaded my bike and  home I went.. It was a two hour one way drive to get there from where I live.. It was worth it.. THANK MILLER GLASS YOUR THE BEST !!< /review>

I recently had all the windows and a sliding glass door replaced in my home by Miller Glass. I had shopping around nervous about this investment; however I'm certain I made the right decision. Sep in sales was very knowledgeable explaining every step of the process. The windows turned out better in quality than expected and show an immediate saving in energy consumption. Richard the installer was extremely professional, clean, and thorough.
I will certainly be suggesting Miller Glass to my friends and family.
Thank you!<//Text>

Fixed a windshield at a great price, answered all my questions and the quality seems awesome so far.  And it's a locally owned business!</review>

<text>Found out our windshield was cracked to undriveable (2/3rds cracked) on a Sunday morning as we were preparing to head out of town. Called insurance, made a claim, earliest Safelite could get to us was Wednesday. However, Miller was authorized, so we had the claim processed with them.

Called Monday morning and was told to bring in car so they got the right windshield. Did. In 10 minutes Troy looked at it, said they'd have the windshield Tuesday, bring the car in at 8, it'd be done by 3:30. Did and done.

So why not 4 ⭐s? Abrasive female who answered phone Monday morning, a whispered (hand covering mouth) conversation with Troy while I was waiting (it probably had nothing to do with me, but I found it inappropriate), witnessed an admonishment of staff while waiting (don't care if the employee needed to be admonished, but I did very much care that it happened in front of paying customers), and the interior of the glass was dirt streaked.

Still, the service was fast and relatively friendly, these minor points are just that, something to improve upon, but definitely not enough to get your panties in a bunch and go elsewhere.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>I tried calling them several times.  One time I talked to a woman that put me on hold for 3 minutes to ask if they could replace my Ford's windshield.  She put me on hold again for 2 minutes to see if they did remote installations or if I would have to bring my car there, then hung up on me.

After over a week of trying to get a hold of them, I called AAA Safety Auto Glass.  They answered on the second ring and in less than a minute I had an appointment sceduled.

Don't waste your time waiting for Miller to get their act together.  Time is money.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I called to ask for their prices and they took all my information down, they even said they would call back. Well they did call back but I was working and when I returned their call the guy was being very rude and said he never called me. I told him I just wanted to know their prices for my model of car and he just said ok but no one called you. It was frustrating. They were just plain rude.< /text>

<text>They came out on time . that's about all I gotta say. They replaced the seals on my window and instead of putting the nice cover peices I had to go with it , they used this white ugly cocking. Now my window looks taky. When I questioned the guy in the condition of the window  he had a smartass attitude. I will not be coming back.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

We tried to have a glass door's runners  repaired. It took a week before anyone showed up, and then they told us they would need another few days to get a quote ready for us.

We found a competitor that came within 24 hours and fixed the door for $250. Four days after the competition fixed our issue, Miller's called us and told us that it would be $520 and would take another week to get the necessary parts. Stay away from Miller's glass!< /text>

Great thrift store. They have lots of variety. The people that work here are very nice. Each week they feature a different color ticket. Today was red (50% off). I've bought carry on luggage for $5, pictures, and arts and crafts supplies.</Review>

<review>I was told yesterday they had a 20 inch pc monitor for sale for $20. However, no one knew tonight which one it was. There was later a young worker that was friendly and assisted me. He showed me one that was probably available but it did not have a price. He suggested that I call tomorrow during the earlier part of the day. I'm going to rebuild a pc and I now need a monitor. I don't need anything expensive. This store was busy and the workers tried to assist me.

A couple days later I went back to the store. I ended up buying a 19 inch flat screen monitor for $8. The person that assisted me was very helpful.</review>< pictures>

I thought I'd give them a chance, but unfortunately the reviewer below me was correct. I deal in used books and found their stock very overpriced. On the plus side, it's in a mall so parking is pretty good. (P.S. 2018 UPDATE: I decided to raise their rating from two to three stars, simply because the owner responded to this four-year-old post a week ago, so perhaps I'll go back someday. The squeaky owner gets the stars! ;-) )</Text>

Lots to choose from like holiday items, clothing,  dishware,  books, shoes, housewares, toys, furniture,  sportswear,  etc. I choose material for a blouse and cookie cutters for a ceramics  class.  Too much more to pick ... next time. :)</review>

Website says this location open until 7:30 PM.  On the door says closes at 5 PM. What a bunch of unprofessionals.  Wasted 30 minutes of drive time through traffic to visit this store. Well I guess they can set arbitrary hours when the store makes over a million $ per year on selling donations.<//text>

Unfortunately, we are under new management and switching the verification authority has been a bit of a challenge, resulting in our inability to change the hours online.

<Time>1391025969781</Time><rating>1</rating><text>I use to shop there at least 5 times a week.  Now, with the new management I visit maybe twice a month.  I realize that you get name brand items, but now they are being over priced...THIS IS A THRIFT STORE and looking for bargains, not EBAY prices.  A majority of your clients are seniors and low income people looking for a bargain, especially on Senior Wednesday.  The new layout is cluttered and difficult to get around.  I am handicapped and find it difficult to get through tight spaces.  Please review the floor plan and prices for our neighborhood.  If you want top dollar for vintage and name brand items, put them on EBAY.  I an insulted to see those two and three digit prices.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1537893984721, 'text': "We are sorry to hear we did not meet your expectations!

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This is a wonderful thriftstore. They have a steady stream of donations so their stock is always fresh and plentiful. I have found many extreme bargains on like-new things here. I bought a crisp-as -new london fog raincoat for only 7 dollars in september. Their shoes are quite a bargain and they have a decent size selection of books and purses. They often have fresh locally grown produce at the register.like lemons,persimmons,grapefruit etc... The staff is friendly and helpful especially if yyou are looking for something specific. I have even called them several days in a row asking if they had 6 matching dining room chaiirs. They have  various bulky items outside in the front like carseats and barstools,strollers etc. pretty affordable as far as thriftstores go.Sometimes they stop accepting donations when they get too many in one day.<//text>< pictures>

<user_name>Rhiannon Smith</user_name><Review>I had crowns put onto two peg teeth I had in the front of my mouth. I had this procedure done back in 2012 and I continually receive compliments from other dentists about how phenomenal they look. Eight years later, they still look just like new with no pain or irritation whatsoever. Being on either side of my two front teeth, it was very important that they look natural; and they look fantastic! I used to hate showing my teeth but ever since, I've always loved my smile :)

The hygienist was always very kind, patient, and I never felt any pain. Dr. Baker was/is honestly the nicest, most patient, and most genuine dentist I've had the pleasure of going to! I wish I still lived in California because I would definitely continue to see Dr. Baker and his team. Dr. Baker does phenomenal work and I would recommend him over anyone else. Hands down, best dentist. Thank you Dr. Baker for a beautiful smile!!!</Review>< Time>

They have the latest technology without losing the personal touch.  The practice offers an "in house" payment plan, where if you pay up front, they significantly discount the fees for services you may need throughout the year.

I was seen today by Dr. Baker today fo a Root Canal! Best experience ever, no pain and haven’t taken any pain medication :) I live 40 miles away and I will continue to come to Division Street  dental for all my visits. I’ve Visited other dentist in my area and I have not received the service that I did receive at Division Street dental. I highly recommend this facility. The staff are very welcoming and generous. Dr. Baker is the best.< /review>

<review>I absolutely love this place!! I was traumatized of the dentist at a young age, so any trips even now at the age of 29 bring anxiety and panic. This place has gone above and beyond to accommodate my needs. Cleanings have become easier, and believe me it’s taken awhile. The staff is always wonderful, from the front to the dental assistants, to the dentist. I’ve seen Dr.Baker and his son, and just yesterday I saw Dr. Arita-Kim.
Dr. Kim was amazing!! I had to fill 4 cavities and it was a walk in the park. Again I know to most cavities are not that big of a deal to most but unfortunately they are for me. Since I have high anxiety coming to the dentist to get fillings/procedures done they prescribe a sedative to be taken before the visit. This has been done twice and has helped me immensely. Throughout the whole visit Dr. Kim continued to ask if I was okay, how I was doing etc. She communicated what she was doing and where she was going next on my teeth. I currently live in the valley and I still make the trip all the way up to their office because of their service and understanding. I cannot thank them enough !! I will continue to keep going to them, they are 110% worth it.</review>< GmapID>

<text>I was really disappointed & frustrated! I was being hustled to receive treatment that I didn't sign for that day. My time was wasted. I lost half of my day off.

I booked for regular cleaning. I understand that as a new patient, they need to take an x-ray for the whole teeth.
After the x-ray, the Doctor ask me if I'm happy about my partials which I mentioned on the paper works that I had signed as part of my background.

Then she told me that she will do an assessment of my gums to see if it's still holding the teeth well, considering my age. So I said okay but I told her that I'm not planning to have anything done today but cleaning.
After the assessment, the girl who did my x-ray ask me to go with her to talk about the assessment and some procedures that I need to have. And I told her that she could just email it to me and we'll talk about it later coz I just want to have my teeth cleaned and I need to go somewhere and it's been 2 hours since I got there.
Then she told me that they can't do the regular cleaning coz the insurance wouldn't allow or pay them due to their findings that I need a deep cleaning. Then I said why? I haven't heard of this before in any dental office I been to. I've done deep cleaning before.
That's why we want you to talk to the lady [I forgot her name coz I'm already upset] to explain to you why.
So I said to her... I was very clear that I didn't want anything done today but Cleaning! Silence..........
I'm DONE here! So I left. It's Unbelievable.
I'm gonna talk to my insurance about this.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I have been a patient of Dr. Baker for approximately 6 years, having been referred by Dr. D. Snow during my second (adult) round of orthodontics.  Hands-down, Dr. Baker, his hygienist, Alicia and the entire staff exhibit professional excellence at all times! Everyone is cheerful and friendly, making every visit a positive and pleasant experience.  I deeply appreciate the effort and adherence in providing exceptional customer service, all while handling a busy and clearly thriving practice! The office is consistently immaculate, fresh and inviting ... The dental care my family and I have received has included preventative, restorative and cosmetic work... it has been expert, performed with precision and care (PAINLESSLY) and will undoubtedly be lasting‼️‼️‼️Cheaper is not necessarily better ... you get what you pay for — the costs associated with our care has always been more than fair. Thank you, Dr. Baker and team for your contribution to dental and overall wellness here in the Antelope Valley.</Review>

Division Street Dental is a clean, comfortable, and friendly neighborhood dentist.  I have had all positive experiences in the two years I have been going to them.

Dr. Baker is thorough, but conservative in his treatment approach. As the daughter of a dentist, I appreciate that very much. He is also gentle, kind and personable. The hygienist, Michelle, is also very thorough and gentle. She’s also very warm and personable.

I used to work in my father’s dental office (8 years). I heard horror stories from our patients about other dental offices that kept people waiting for hours, or shamed people into unnecessary and expensive dental work.  I am relieved and happy to report that Division Street Dental treats people with respect.  They offer a variety of cosmetic treatments, but they don’t force you or shame you into spending money.

They have a pre-payment discount plan for patients who don’t have insurance. Their price structure is pretty typical—they are not the cheapest dental office  in town. But you can trust what they tell you, and they won’t force you to pay for a bunch of stuff you don’t need, which is worth every penny!</Review><rating>5</rating></record>

We have been on a hunt for a new dentist since Dr. Edward Baker retired. We’ve been to a few different dentists in the antelope valley and my kid still had plaque on his teeth when he left a cleaning, they really didn’t have a plan for his class 3 underbite. This dentist and hygienist were amazing! My son and I got the best cleaning we’ve had in a long time. The dentist was not rushed and she was very knowledgeable on all our options for my son’s underbite. They explained how his saliva is very acidic causing constant build up and gave me options to help. No other dentist was able to identify why my sons plaque build up happens so quickly.

I loved this place they were incredibly clean considering covid19, on time no waiting, and the staff was really helpful and friendly!! I highly recommend this dentist office! 🙌🏼<//review>

The dentist my family used for 20 years retired and so we were without a dentist. We tried three other dentist office’s, with no success. My daughter and I have some dental anxiety and thought we were never going to find a new dentist we felt was honest and capable. So far Dr. Baker and his office staff are wonderful and have exceeded any expectation we had. I am already referring my friends who were at my retired dentists’ office and are unhappy with were they are going now to Division Street Dental too. The only drawback I can think of is that even with good insurance I still have out of pocket costs.<//text>

I have been coming to Division Street Dental since my family moved to Lancaster in 1998 (back when it was actually on Division Street). I've lived in LA the last 6 year and make the trip every 6 months for Dr. Baker and his group. I have been having my teeth cleaned by Alicia since I was 16. She's like a sister to me! Everyone in the office is so friendly and nice, and on the rare occasion I need anything other than a cleaning, the ladies on the procedure-side do a great job keeping me comfortable and relaxed. They have a great office staff, and a beautiful office.</Review>

The staff is very friendly and willing to work with you in order to be able to get you to see the doctors. The doctors are attentive to the patient and make sure that they aren't in any way uncomfortable wether it is a simple check up or getting work done on there teeth. Definitely a place to look into if you are planning to see a dentist.<//review>

We have been coming to Division Street dental since they were over on Division Street! They are always friendly and accommodating. My dental hygienist Alicia, is the real reason we have been with them so long. She does a fantastic job with our cleaning and has always gotten our family in on the same afternoon like clockwork. She is knowledgeable and is fantastic with my kids. They have come since they were 2 and 5 years old. The office uses the most up to date dental technology. And I appreciate the painless approach to dentistry, especially for my children.</review>

Division Street Dental is the very best dental office in every way. The whole staff is very friendly along with Dr.Baker. The office is beautiful and immaculate. I feel I'm in the best of hands with Dr. Baker and Deanna as his assistant. Deanna explains everything that is about to happen and that takes away all the anxiety-a 5 Star  rating is underscoring how great they all are. I highly recommend this office to everyone.</text>

I can't thank Dr. Baker enough for my beautiful smile. For years I lived with damaged enamel on my front teeth and I always covered up my mouth when I smiled. Dr. Baker restored my smile line and gave me back so much confidence. He and his assistant Deanna made sure I was comfortable and pain free throughout the entire process. I highly recommend Division Street Dental to anyone who is looking for a dentist.</Text>

Me and my family have been going to Division Street Dental since it was actually located on Division Street. The staff is always so very friendly and acknowledge us by first name, even if they're new staff. We've always gone to see Alicia Mayoral-Rindlisbacher as our hygienist. She's a great, gentle hygienist, even our kids like her, even when she shames them for bad teeth brushing habits. :) The dentists are also great and gentle, I had a root canal done and was immediately able to go to work. If you're looking for an Awesome dentist and cleaner, look no further!</review>

Have been going to this dentist for years. Always good to see Deanna's familiar face since she's been working there for years. All the employees are professional and treat us well. They are not the most inexpensive, but they have all the latest-and-greatest gadgets to give you the best dental care for your teeth. Highly recommend them.<//Text>

I heard about this practice via AD that was sent to my home address. I read up on Dr. Bakers practice and experience and gave it a shot. I am so glad I did because the whole staff ranging from the doctor to the front desk were welcoming, friendly, and all collaborated with each other . I was worried I wouldn't receive the customer service I was looking for but I left extremely satisfied after my visit.

I was seen by Dr. Baker, Deanna (assistant), Alicia (hygienist) and Jennifer helped with billing questions and insurance processing.

Thank you for a great dental experience.< /review>

I was just 4 years old when I had my first dental appointment with Dr. Baker and Deanna.  Deanna always took care of me and made sure I was in the best care with Dr. Baker. They always tell me exactly what they are doing and ask  if I am ok while I am there.  I will recommend them to all my friends and hopefully they will still be here when I have my own kids.<//Text>

If you’ve picked Dr. Baker, then you’ve picked right!  The major reason I’ve been going to Division St. Dental is how good they are with pain management.

Have been coming to division street dental for over 11 years.  Great place to get a large family seen in a short time because of the amount of staff.  Thank you Alicia, Dr. Baker, and all the rest who have helped us over the years.<//Text>

The food is very Hardy perfect for someone who works hard and can afford the extra calories. The papusas are very flavorful and hit the spot. I've been out in this area fixing a roof and after 10 hours of back breaking labor nothing satisfies my belly like a proper Salvadorian meal prepared by good people with a passion to share their beautiful culture.

Depending on what you order the food can be carbohydrate heavy but isnt greasy or flavorless -- very fresh.

The food was warm when I picked it up, the staff all had masks, and the restaurant itself was clean.<//Review>

Almost always mess up my order. But when they give me what i ask for, it's pretty good food. The young lady at the counter is very snooty. I doubt i'll go there again.<//Text>

*Pupusas were SOO good 👍
*Curtido was not that fresh but still edible.
*Salsa for the pupusas was very watered down. It was just okay.
*Platanos Fritos with beans n cream were really really GOOD!!!

Can't speak for the rest of the food or staff, etc. as it was a third party delivery. Will try this restaurant again.< /text>

Simply put. The PAPUSAS Are one of the best in town. I always order the yuca Frita con Chicharrón, which is always A+. Another thing that makes this place so super amazing is their pickled cabbage. Every time I order I need extra bags of pickled cabbage. It's good on everything it's perfectly seasoned, and perfectly pickled. I love this Salvadoran place. It's simply amazing.
I've had a few of their breakfast place also with your nice and hearty. It's good for breakfast lunch or dinner. And perfect for the college kids that go to Contra Costa College< /Text>

< Review>
Food was the perfect level of salty. It's like they read my mind and knew exactly how much salt I needed, both taste wise and physically. Check it; that deep fried plantain! So good. I usually don't like plantains but loved this one. Honestly the food couldn't have better, all the staff seems super friendly and the wait for the food isn't as long as other places. It's not that costly and feels right at home if you have Salvadoran roots.< /Review>

After I placed my order, they told me total, then when I asked to confirm it, gave me other total, when I went to pick it up, charged me other amount. My order wasn’t complete, and after I called they, they didn’t apologize for the inconvenient. I do not think I would be back to that restaurant. Bad service!<//Review>

<Review>If you dont mind poor customer service and ok food this is the place for you. Come here hoping to get 1 particular waiter that knows proper customer service but shes never there when we go. Food is ok not bad but not amazing neither way better that other places around the area tho. Took my own cup of coffee and the waiter rolled her eyes and brought  me a toy cup like if their coffee was good. Food was served and never saw the waiter again we had to ask the register guy for napkins and more coffe and more curtido... we were practically our own waiters.<//Review>< date>

I love the food here.  What I suggest is that they have a hostess for busy days because they look disorganized with that.  On this visit my fiance asked for one pupusa to accompany his main plate. The waitress said you can only order two  and I told her that we always order one along with the main dish, she repeated you can only order two, we ordered them, but they can have better service without their rules that commit you to ask for something you don't want.<//review>

<Text>The building is nice and clean all the time. The food is nice but some of the things can be pretty be pretty overpriced like some of the breakfast items. I remember seeing a plate with a BIT of refried beans, a BIT of rice, like 2 small fried eggs, 4 pieces of fried plaintains for about $17 which is insane.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808577c32eceecb9:0x706ab0c5a84b0434</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wow
Great food. Great service. Great fun. Tunes were on point and a man yelled along to the song.
Food was the perfect level of salty. It's like they read my mind and knew exactly how much salt I needed, both taste wise and physically.
Check it; that deep fried plantain! So good. I usually don't like plantains but loved this one< /text>

Salvadorean Restaurant, has great dishes. There pupusas are good, they aren't grease, the taste is great. Their steak and shrimp dish is very good. The employees are nice. Place gets packed on the weekends.<//Text>

<text>Terrible place!! This place rips you off every chance they get. They add a few dollars here and there and even add the tip without telling you. If you don't notice you will be overcharged or may tip twice. They've overcharged me every visit. After a long absence, I go back in hopes it's changed and it's even worse. No more visits from me.. The guy behind the counter is a shark, rude and has no concept of customer service. He is snarky and sarcastic and blames you if they get the order wrong. The food is mediocre and not worth what they charge. Save your money and go get great pupusas, good food with good customer service across the street. Minus 1 star!!! Terrible, terrible.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><date>1548312085109< /date><Response>None</Response>< Name>

Food  is ok but customer service is the worse. A little pricy for that type of customer service in my opinion. Waited for food about 45 min and one of my kids has to wait longer, when I asked for my son’s food the waitress said it would take another 5-10 min more so how can you start eating when one of your children has to wait that long?? First and last time there.< /text>

Haven't been here in a while and this place seems like it's going down, the waitresses are gossiping talking about massages with happy ending with a man colleague... Like no one cares to hear this while we are waiting for our food to eat so unprofessional , they talk to much and stand around while tables sit with out being cleaned. I waited for my food legit 45 minutes when there was only 3 other tables . After that they didn't even bother to check back up to see if everything was ok.< /Review>

Love this place! I've gone for lunch and for dinner. There is a selection of Salvadoran, Mexican and other regional latin fare. My go to is the fried plantain with beans and sour cream and 2 papusas. Delicious and economical too. Family friendly, but gotta say the kids options are not exactly health conscious, but who doesn't like a deep fried treat time to time ? :)</Text>

The food is good but the service is somewhat poor here. Takes a while for simple dishes to be served and if you dont speak Spanish it's pretty difficult to get your order in with the language barrier.</review>

Just because you walk back behind the counter doesn’t mean we can’t hear you gossiping from the farthest table in your lobby. And the food is so bland. Not at all worth the wait or the price. You are better off across the street at the real authentic Salvadorian restaurant or even the nearest pizza just a few doors down.

Im so disappointed in them i went tonight to buy pupusas and my son almost chocked on a piece of plastic and then i was chewing on mine and got another plastic as well. This is ridiculous how do u not check your food while prepping and could you imagine if my son and i would have choked.. i called them immediately and all the guy could say i dont know how that happend and making me feel like i made it up! Excuse me your lucky i was nice enough to call and inform you verses me call FOOD Administration on your place.. after my full on discussion he could only say well if you want come back and we will exchange them. Instead of giving a sincere apology and offering to refund. Honestly i will never go back. Thanks but no thank you!!!<//Review>

Horrible  food! I got camarones rancheros and there was only like 6 shrimp and the rest was lots and lots of onion mix with jalapeños and bell peppers,  the beans were nasty , they tasted old and the rice was hard it looked like it was mixed with old rice , I will not go back ! NASTY<//review>

<review>Used to come here every week, but stopped coming because the service went down. Tried it again today and the waitress was very unattentive. Got something in my food and they replaced the item and left everything else in the same plate, and was still charged for it. Asked for coffee refill, as well as the check. Coffee took forever to arrive, and the check never did. Had to go to the front desk. No smiles, no thank you. Service is terrible!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808577c32eceecb9:0x706ab0c5a84b0434</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>I used to love these place 😍 but not anymore 😭 .....They over charged me twice on two different days . I called them and they said they can't do anything about it because it was not on a different shift . Also they let people go into the restaurant asking for money and is very uncomfortable.<//Text><Time>1569636711523</Time>< resp>

(Translated by Google) The restaurant was very dirty, I asked for a chíllate without any nuisance $ 9.50 the food is good but the service is very bad with not coming more enough before the service was good so I wanted to return but today if I leave disappointed there was no soap in the bathroom

(Original)
Muy sucio el restaurante pedí un chíllate sin nuegados $9.50 la comida esta bien pero el servicio muy malo con no venir más basta antes era bueno el servicio por eso quise regresar pero hoy si me voy desepcionado no había ni jabón en el baño<//Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) My husband and I have been very well taken care of this afternoon, a delicious food and a totally friendly and attentive staff from the moment of arrival to the time of departure.
I am surprised by the quality, I had heard that we first eat through the eyes and really if they have served us the food in such a simple way but very call and not to mention the very rich simple but delicious taste I recommend this place as a warm and cozy family place .

(Translated by Google) More garbage restaurant is not worth it, never put the food as it is always missing something, the truth is not worth it, money is wasted, it is not worth it, nor should I call them these cheers

<review>(Translated by Google) Each time they give a terrible service and they have even charged me for what I have not eaten and without giving a receipt for what I consumed, the people who attend have been arrogant many times, I think that one is going to pay for what one is going to eat, not that give it away. There is a young lady who attends in the morning and she is very charismatic and kind, she gives her best effort. But those in the afternoon leave much to be desired.

(Original)
Cada vez dan un servicio pésimo y hasta me han cobrado lo que no me he comido y sin dar recibo de lo que consumí, las personas que atienden han sido muchas veces arrogantes, creo que uno va a pagar lo que se va a comer no que le regalen. Hay una señorita que atiende en la mañana y es muy carismatica y amable, da su mejor esfuerzo. Pero las de la tarde dejan mucho que desear.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) The food is excellent but the attention is very bad in many things I like to go but sometimes you forget to make an order that we ask, do not carry everything that the saucer says it takes when Servin one has to be asking what he needs the hot drinks are not very hot, but the only thing that the food is good but the attention is very bad.

(Original)
La comida está excelente pero la atención es muy mala en muchas cosas me gusta ir pero unos veces se le olvida hacer una orden que pedimos, no llevan todo lo que el platillo dice que lleva cuando lo Servin uno les tiene que estar pidiendo lo que necesita las bebidas calientes no están muy calientes, pero lo único que la comida está bueno pero la atención es muy mala.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The food is tasty, but the service for you to attend this bad, the waitresses talking, and customers waiting to be served wait 30 minutes just to take the menu, you see that they are not grabbing anything but they will not serve you, Last time I have this place.

(Original)
La comida esta sabrosa ,pero el servicio para que te atiendan esta malisimo,las meseras platicando,y los clientes esperando que los atiendan espere 30 minutos solo para que me llevaran el menú, las ves que no estan asiendo nada pero no van a atenderte ,ultima ves que vicito este lugar.😔< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Good food but very bad service, whenever we have gone with my family to past something negative, to mention a few things, once they threw the paper that avia wrote the sheet, and after an hour I asked for the order They gave an account, and again they took the food and they did not take them fork or knife or napkins, again we asked them to take two more coffee and they did not take them, that's just to mention a few things, finally come to the conclusion of not returning to this place.

(Original)
Buena comida pero muy mal servicio, siempre que emos ido con mi familia a pasado algo negativo, por mencionar algunas cosas, una vez tiraron a la vasura el papel que avia escribido la mecera, y asta después de una hora que pregunte por la orden se dieron cuenta, y otra vez los llevaron la comida y no los llevaron tenedor ni cuchillo ni cervilletas, otra vez les pedimos a dos meceras que los llevaran más cafe y no los llevaron, eso nomas por mencionar algunas cosas, al fin llegue a la conclusión de no regresar a este lugar.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It was one of my favorite places, until this past weekend, I had my bad experience with an arrogant and foolish waitress, I do not know if she owns the restaurant or if she is too pedantic, they should train their employees well because if they do not like it That job they look for one that suits them, since the food is not served free of charge.

(Original)
Era uno de mis lugares favoritos, hasta este pasado fin de semana, tuve mi mala experiencia con una mesera prepotente y necia no se si es dueña del restaurante o que pero es demasiado pedante deberian de capacitar bien a sus empleadas ya que si no les gusta ese trabajo que busquen uno que se les acomode, ya que la comida no la sirven de a gratis.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service, I do not return to This Place, wait 20 minutes and no napkins were brought to the table, in that time 4 people (men) came to the table next to me and immediately they put napkins, tanned and drinks .. And when I asked for utensils they told me they weren't dry. So after the wait and attitude of the employees I decided to leave the Place and not return ...

(Original)
Pesimo servicio, no regreso a Este Lugar, espere 20 minutos y ni servilletas trajeron a la mesa, en ese tiempo llegaron 4 personas (hombres)a la mesa de a lado y enseguida les pusieron servilletas, curtitido y bevidas.. Y cuando pedi utencilios me dijeron que no estaban secos. Asi que despues de la espera y actitud de las empleadas yo decidi salir del Lugar y no regresar...< /Review>

(Translated by Google) They use the milk from the coffee again to give it to the customers, it came dirty and when I asked for another look they did not fill it, they just grabbed one that they had collected from the counter and since there were not many people I knew it was from the other table because the frets when they gave me that milk and that one had sauce and I told him and they didn't listen to me anymore. The tanning of the pupusas was dry for me. I had several days left and I asked for a fresher one. They wanted to charge me. they did and it was still heard outside .. the worst service I could have and I still was not leaving when I hear that they start to say that the table is stingy that they did not leave a tip .. how can I leave if I still do not leave

(Original)
La leche del café la vuelven a utilizar para dársela a los clientes, venía sucia y cuando pedi otra mire que no la llenaron sólo agarraron una que habían recogido del mostrador y como no había mucha gente sabía que era de la otra mesa porque ahí seguían los trastes cuando me dieron esa leche y esa tenía salsa y le dije y ya no me hacían caso. El curtido de las pupusas me tocó seco ya tenía varios días echo y pedi otro más fresco me lo quisieron cobrar, el cajero es muy grosero al pedirle las cosas, una mesera alta flaca se la paso diciendo groserías dentro de la cocina por cada pedido que le hacían y todavía se escuchaba afuera.. el peor servicio que pude tener y todavía no me iba cuando escucho que empiezan a decir que tacaña la mesa que no dejó propina.. como voy a dejar si aún no me voy</text>

(Translated by Google) Friendly waitress, wanting to do a good service, more inexperienced, the waiting time is approximately 45 minutes ... the Salvadoran soup well what the flavor should be ... the shrimp and the crab legs leave them at the end and they had a rotten taste ... anyway just good small portion ... omelets made by hand the best .... place has a lot of potential more it lacks too much ... relatively exaggerated price for food ..

(Original)
Mesera amable, con ganas de hacer un buen servicio más no tiene experiencia, el tiempo de espera es aproximadamente 45 minutos...la sopa salvadoreña bien me qué do debiendo el sabor ...el camaron y las patas de cangrejo los deje al final y tenian un sabor a podrido...en fin solo bien porsion pequeña ... tortillas hecha s a mano lo mejor....lugar tiene mucho potencial más le hace falta demasiado...precio por la comida relativamente exagerado..< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Woww I was surprised at the bad service they have in this place with the lack of experience of the waitresses or those who carry the food if they can be called so they have no order or experience in how to serve the clients I had to wait 30 mnts . To hear my Order and one hour to be waiting for an atol.
Recommendation!!! ORDER THE MEAL BY TELEPHONE ONE HOUR BEFORE AND ORDER THE TABLE IN TIME
