<review>During my vacation to Seal Beach California. My phone wasn’t charging anymore in the charging port. I called this store and said they would look at and clean it for free. The next day I went and Angel took a look at my phone and cleaned and said I didn’t need to replace the whole charging port which would of cost me 90$. He was honest and professional. He didn’t want me to give him any money. I told him I didn’t free right not paying for his services.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dd2e5c2902aebf:0x93b5378d103d8fba<//GmapID></record>

After dropping my phone into a sink full of water, the home button stopped working. Orange County Comupter Repair in Los Alamitos has it fully functioning in under 5 minutes at NO charge!! This location has taken great care of our devices for years! We won’t go elsewhere!</Text>

I went in to get my home button replaced and the tech was able to do so, but I lost all functionality of the features. Don’t waste your time or money. its better to go to the Apple store. I wasted $80 on getting the button replaced. So much for supporting local businesses.< /text>

LOOK AT THE REVIEWS! Straight up, they have a whole bunch of 5 star reviews from people who only have reviewed 3 places: all three are computer places. They are reviewing themselves. Look at the 4 3 2 and 1 star reviews. These are the accurate ones and there are quite a few of em. I took my laptop here because my hard drive was making a loud noise and was crashing regularly. They tried to charge me 250 to fix it. If I was to replace a hard drive, it would have cost me 50 bucks and about 10 minutes of labor. When I went in, I asked if they replaced it and they said they did not, so I asked that they lower the price and so they did. About a month later, my hard drive crashed again so I bought a new hard drive and replaced it myself. I give them a solid 2 stars. They technically did fix my laptop short term, but there are better computer places out there. And as you may now notice, they are not an honest company.</review>

This is my go-to spot for computer service. Noel offers very reasonable price compared to other computer services in Los Angeles area. I came here the other day for diagnostic and within ten minutes he already found out what happened and fixed it immediately. Recommended!!!<//Review>

ASKED TO KEEP PICTURES FROM MY PHONE!!!!

I left my phone at this shop on a Thursday afternoon, and the staff member who assisted me seemed very helpful. We texted back and forth a bit concerning the work that needed to be done, and by Monday afternoon he felt comfortable enough to ask if he could keep a picture of me he had found while going through my phone. When I called and asked to speak to the manager I was given an email address, and have yet to receive a response. Not only is this place clearly lacking in professionalism, but talk about an absolute violation of privacy, and a complete breach of trust. If I were you, I’d stay safe and completely avoid this place.</Review>

After my laptop would not boot up, I wanted a pro to take a look. Freddy the tech..said I needed new hard drive..$250. I couldn't see spending that much on an old laptop..After I took it home watched a few YouTube videos on the fix...I fixed it myself.  I'm pretty sure it was not intentional in trying to RIP me off..but.Freddy the tech  is not the knowledgable pro I thought he was. It did cost me $40 for his professional opinion. Btw their website says they open at 8am..the door sign says 9am<//review>

<Review>I cracked the screen of my son’s chrome book and called them and was told to bring it in for an estimate. Doing so the guy up front said the estimate would be ready in about an hour. When i came back a different guy told me it was $155 but would not - and i asked him - would not put it in writting only writing the number “155” by itself on a post it note when I asked again (maybe in case I didn’t know what the number 155 looked like lol).I asked him for something a little more official and he refused shaking his head and pointing at the post it note and said “thats it”. Why would a legitimate business not back up their estimate in writing on company paperwork - seemed too easy for him to charge me a higher price after the repair without anything written so i declined and left - would not recommend going there unless you like taking chances and have time to kill<//Review>< response>

<Text>needed to backup all my work on my MacBook since it was a work-laptop & I had to return it, I call a few places but they wanted me to leave the laptop for the day & pick it up the following day, the only problem was that I needed the computer the same day.... I call this guys & they said they can do the backup work, all the same, so I brought it here, left it at midday & by afternoon, my laptop was ready... I was glad I found this guys.... thank you!< /Text><name>karla Jefferson<//name></record></dataset><record>

My iPhone 6 had a bad battery (the battery actually had a whole in it!) and discoloration on my screen. CROC, fixed it and gave me a great price and a warranty for their service! I highly recommend this professional team for your your all tech needs.< /Review>

<gmap_id>0x80dd2e5c2902aebf:0x93b5378d103d8fba<//gmap_id><text>Alright, so for starters, let me talk a little bit about why I came here.

I recently moved to the area and actually had my computer shipped all the way from Wisconsin. Shipping my gaming desktop was quite a scary thing to do but I really had no other choice because I wasn't about to make a flight back from California to Wisconsin then back again for the computer. This option turned out to be cheaper.

When the computer made its way over here the external video card was actually not working (it had worked fine in the past), but on-board video actually got the job done. Didn't know why that was the case but I really didn't mind all too much. So about a week or two into using it, while I'm playing a game, the computer video just completely shuts off, everything - HDMI, DVI, VGA - nothing would work.

That's what brought me to Orange County Computer Repair.  I didn't really have the tools to fix the issue myself as I recently moved and I didn't exactly know what the issue was, so I decided to be a little lazy and let someone else take over. It could have been anything, from the power supply not working correctly, the motherboard being completely broken (this is actually a fairly new motherboard) or some other issue.

Anyway, I have this company fix the problem and they call me back fairly quickly and tell me I have two issues. 1., the obvious - the video card isn't working and they can order a new one of the same kind to be shipped to their place and 2., something really stupid with the processor's heat sink. I told them not to order another video card because the cost would be $200 more compared to $150 for just "repairing the processor's heat sink" (which I still regard to be a little overpriced). They said they would have it fixed the same day by 3:00pm - they had called me almost around noon.

So for probably less than three hours of work, they had my computer finished and I went to pick it up a few days later. I did not sign the "satisfied customer line" because I was a little skeptical of that and I didn't want to be trapped if the issue was not fixed. And alas, I go home, test it out, and it doesn't work. So I called them back and I was pretty pissed, but held my tongue, and they tell me that I actually need to take out the video card for my on-board video to even work. After that the computer booted up just fine, which led me to believe that they possibly jipped me of $130 more than they should have.

So for not telling me that I needed to take out my defective video card out for the computer to even function, I removed one star. For being extremely over-priced, I removed another. (Not fair prices at all, at least in my experience.)

Hopefully they did not steal $130 out of my wallet, but who knows? I should have taken the video card out in the first place. I'll have to pass on that bit of information to someone else in my life story who has that issue.

However, I do have two good things to say. 1 - They fixed the issue, or at least told me how to fix my issue for $130 and 2 - They were pretty decently fast. Next time I would probably have them inspect the issue and see what I can do myself.

Three stars.</text><Rating>3< /Rating><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Date>1457037557477</Date><rate>5<//rate><Review>My boyfriend and I have been looking for a good computer repair place to fix his to Toshiba. Came in on a weekday and was a little busy did not take long to be assisted. We've also been looking for a used MacBook to buy and they happened to have a couple that were recent and still in great condition. I was able to get such a great price for my MacBook Pro 13 2012 under $600 with a 6 month warranty AND a top and bottom hard case cover for FREE. The workers here are very helpful, professional but also personable, direct and knowledgable about MacBooks and other services for computers and phones. No wonder every time we're here there's always a lot customers.  They do a great job negotiating with what you (as a customer) can work with and the best way they can help you. We do not see any future problems with the MacBook they sold us and are confident we can come back if we need anything fixed. :)</Review>< pictures>

<time>1594402521157<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>Beyond happy with the service provided by Davis Import & Domestic Auto Services. Our company was in need of brake repairs for our primary vehicle, and we were struggling to find a shop that could provide appointments and accurate time frames for repairs. Look not further than Davis Import & Domestic Auto Services to save the day. Megan quickly got us squared away and ensured the vehicle would be done within 2-3 hours tops. Not only did they follow through on ALL of their promises, they were able to complete repairs earlier than anticipated. Highly recommend doing business with this company. They are fast, friendly and super easy to work with. Thank you for the incredible service!!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Cannot recommend this group any higher. Very fair pricing, but they won me over with their personality. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff, solid communication about my car's problems, and when it turned out to be a bigger issue than I was prepared to deal with, they helped me out and showed me some good other options. Tisha, Rafael, and Megan were all wonderful, and while I didn't have the pleasure of meeting anyone else, I am confident they are just as great. I really appreciate all the work they did for me, and if I ever find myself in need of more help, I know where I'll be going.<//review>

<text>I've known Rafael and Tisha for nearly 10 years, and I've taken my car to Rafael for service almost as long. I have brought my car to Davis Import Auto since Rafael assumed ownership several months ago, and I think they did a great job making the shop their own - and making it a place where they can continue to offer high-quality service. They are trustworthy and reliable, and I highly recommend them!</text>< user>

Great mechanics, fair prices, family owned.

All of those things are so rare anymore.

I also value the extra pair of eyes on the condition
of my car; not being an automotive person, it
is like having a mechanic in the family.<//review>

customer service really struggled.  refused to give a simple quote to replace my leaky radiator, made me stand and wait to pay for 20 minutes while simply chatting with a non-customer, expensive oil change and inspection provided little-no information on the car: brakes, tires, etc.  confused given other reviews; would rather go to the dealer.< /Review>

< Review>
This is the only repair shop we now take our cars to, and it's the most ethical and trustworthy place I've been to in Davis.  Prices are very reasonable, repairs are excellent, the explanations from Bob and Jared are thorough, and I have nothing but praise for the job they do.  Even when we've had odd things happen at the most inopportune times, this business has never hesitated to have us bring the car right in, and has even given us advice over the phone when we weren't sure if it was safe to drive the car in or not. Even their dog is friendly when greeting me. Our two cars together have about 350,000 miles on them, and they're running great.  I can't recommend this place enough.<//Review>

The customer service at this facility was excellent. They got my car in and done the same day. However, I think the price was a little steep for this kind of job.
Otherwise my experience was great!<//Review>

I have a 2008 Saab 9-3. Needless to say it is not the easiest car to find parts for or work on since Saab went out of business. Davis Imports have serviced my car to an exceptional level, their customer service is amazing, prices extremely competitive, and the work is done to the highest standard.
Short story, we were driving home to Phoenix for Christmas when a code came up. Turned out the fuel pump was about to go out. We took it in and the guys were able to find a new fuel pump, install it and get us back on the road to get home before Christmas Eve! We wouldn't have made it home if it wasn't for Jared and the team at Davis Imports!<//text>

< Review>
More expensive than Toyota Dealer!  I brought my Prius in 4/19/16 for a 60,000 mile service, which is oil change and filter and replacing air cabin and air engine filters.  I was given an estimate of $406, with 2.1 hours labor.  They first defended this price, but when I told them I paid $136 on 10/22/15 for an oil change and filter there (.9 hr labor),  the price was lowered to $345. I then noticed that the estimate charged twice for the cabin filter, and they said they would deduct another $37, but when I asked them to lower the duplicate labor as well (which was .3 hr for each air filter), I was refused service and told to go elsewhere.  Miata Toyota in Sacramento charges $305.95 for 60k service.  I dealt with Bob, the owner, who has probably processed hundreds for oil and air filter changes for Priuses in Davis -- how could he not know from the start that $406 was an inflated charge?< /Review>

This store has the worst customer service support. Some of the employees are extremely unprofessional and they don’t know much about the products they are selling to customers. They fail to meet customer needs and requirements! The customers go to this store expecting a great experience but it’s by far the worst. Cricket wireless has better customer service. They where also playing music so loud. I felt like I was at a night club! I will not be visiting this store ever again!</review>

They have the worse customer service . They are very unprofessional.  They don't explain things to the customers . They weren't even wearing their marks properly . The guy that was talking was spitting on my face while he was talking to me . It says everyone is required to  wear a mask to be inside the store but people went in without one.  They arent following their corporation's guidelines that they have posted on their windows . I am never returning to this store. Im thankful they opened the new Tmobile store . Everyone at the other store was very professional.< /review>

The tenacity, good customer service and the professionalism was very compensating towards my situation. Omar, Andrew, Abdul, and Liz helped me set up my phone towards the end of the process. I was once again came welcomed by Cris today and he helped my transfer all my stuff into my new phone. Very personable and I see great leadership in him.

It was Jason who was promoted and got assistant manger job in Roseville. We bought a phone from him. He said your payment is for two years. But no, it was for three years. He did not give us a receipt otherwise we would have caught it right a way. He had us sign on a electronic device, so we did not even know what we were signing for. And he said you are getting a free cover. No, it was not free. The reason it's hard to notice all that is because he would add a small amount to monthly payment. They don't want to tell you the full price of the phone. All they want to tell is how much is your monthly payment. But for how long? It was supposed to be for 24 months, not 36 months. Cheater, you Jason, the assistant manager in Roseville who used to work in Yuba City.< /Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Still won't take care of their existing customers.  I have had TMobile for 14 years, and every time they run a promotion, I loose out.  I need to add another line or buy a ton of stuff I don't need to be able to get a deal.  After 14 years shouldn't other loyal customers and I get a break.  I guess it time to switch! If Tmobile doesn't care about my business, then there is no reason to stay with them.</Text><GmapID>0x8084acae9feff051:0xbf08947d757bb0ab</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was asked by 2 people within 60 seconds if I needed help. That's cool, except for the fact that the 1st person who asked me was standing next to the second person who asked me. Did you not hear the first time that I was just there to try check out some phones? Needless to say, I did not get to try anything, and I will be driving to a store about 30 miles away to purchase my 2 phones.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>Went in expecting the usual sales pitch for the "best plan and phone" and had a totally different experience. The biggest shock to me was the associate that helped me pick out what I needed and a price range not much bigger that my previous payments. She was well versed in her electronics, told me everything right off the bat regarding every phone that did what I needed for work, and never once did I feel pressured from her when we went through just about every possibility. I'm lucky that I had a very knowledgeable employee and have never been happier with my service as I am now.</review><date>1473289338781< /date>< username>

< Review>
I tried for 8 days to get T-Mobile to release my number and unlock my phone. Customer service was either not authorized or incapable of helping me at least they acted like they could not help insisting that they would send an email to the manufacturer to release my phone . Ultimately no email to release my phone was ever sent. When I insisted on getting something in writing and sat down Shawn from mall security came and I went outside with him and expressed my frustrations. I then went back inside where they gave me in writing that their policy was to send an email. Later that same day Nathan Skousen sent me an email disassociating me from the SunStor and banning me from the mall saying I had tossed some papers at a T-Mobile employee. This is a blatant untruth as the whole point of my going there was to get something from T-Mobile in writing since they had for days provided me with no service and would no release the T-Mobile lock on my phone.  The next day I was approached by mall security to sign a banned from the mall form while I was sitting down and working with my son who is a vendor at the mall. I did not sign the form because their is no justification for banning me from the mall. No one was threatened or harmed in any way, except the person who was paying for service he did not receive I know the poor customer service representatives are stressed because they are not allowed to provide the service customers are requesting. That is not the fault of the customer, rather it is corporate T-Mobile who is to blame. I happen to be in a body of black skin with a strong voice but that is not justification to ban me for life. As I waited in line an unpigmented person in a wheel chair flailed his arms and loudly complained for 15 plus minutes. No one called security on Him as he expressed dissatisfaction with having to pay $90 for his 1 T-Mobile line. They never did help reduce his bill just took his payment and told him it could be reduced when he turned 65. I was there to switch my phone to Verizon through ACN for only $39.99 per month. I gave him a business card and he went on his way. SunStor Solar sent me an email telling me I was to be disassociated from them and be banned from the mall for Life. Even after I served customers including two off duty mall security guards in the SunStor and a 3rd gentlemen who also wanted my help.
with I was banned from the mall for insisting on being helped. No one at T-Mobile the place where I had purchased the phone was ever able to help as day after day of no service went by. Again and again I was made promises. I paid the price of being disassociated by SunStor Solar because according to the Mall banning form I was “ me disassociated from my work partners in the mall without even taking a statement or ever helping me . On the 8th day a representative from Apple helped. Get my phone released from T-Mobile by insisting they were responsible to unlock my phone. In that hour suddenly they were able to help. Regrettably no one has apologized or offered any compensation for my having no service though my service is still paid for, no one has apologized for unjustly having me banned from the mall and being disassociated from SinStor Solar at the Yuba Sutter Mall. I have refused to honor the mall ban and refuse to return to T-Mobile ever again. It has been the worst service I’ve had in 58 years of customer service. I never would have imagined that a person could be treated in this way simply for wanting to change service from T-Mobile to Verizon. Beware T-Mobile is courteous but not actually helpful should you decide to change carriers unless you get an Apple reprresentative to insist they provide an unlock code. Only then will it be done. Horrific experience that I would not recommend to anyone.< /Review>

<Review>I had an issue with T-mobile and I was getting it resolved through the support team online- and via customer care over the phone. I then had to go into the store and get something verified and have a T-mobile representative call over to the customer care and verify. From there a customer care agent would handle everything else. All the T-mobile rep had to do was look at something and call. For such a small task for a rep to do, I got the most terrible response and service. I was told NUMEROUS times that it would be a waste of his time. The reason behind it was because he had simply never heard of such a thing. He, in front of me, had asked several other employees “have you heard of this before?”. In which all of them responded no. Yes, my case was different and complicated, but he in no way had to do ANYTHING, but call over and verify a text message in which I was ADVISED to do so by a customer care supervisor. When I was told it was a waste of time because he calls customer care all the time and that he’s never heard of that before I was taken back, and asked if I was going to have to call them even though that is not my job and I have been with the company over a year. He told me to go ahead because if he did it he knows it’s going to be a waste of time. I again stated that I shouldn’t have to and asked if any other T-mobile rep would DO THEIR JOB and help me. I kid you not, They all just stared at me like I was crazy. He ended up calling which he didn’t seem happy about it and after being hung up on twice and put on hold for 7 minutes he had the audacity to say “well I’ve been on hold for 7 minutes, like I said before it’s going to be a waste of time”. I DONT CARE IF YOU THINK YOUR TIME WILL BE WASTED. I WILL NOT, AND DO NOT EXPECT ANY CUSTOMER TO EVER JUST TAKE AN EMPLOYEES WORD THAT “THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME AND NOTHING WILL BE DONE” WHEN IM TOLD OTHERWISE. WHY NOT CALL AND FIND OUT? IT DOESNT HURT TO TRY RIGHT? AND WETHER OR NOT HE WAS RIGHT IT IS NOT OKAY TO MAKE A CUSTOMER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, FEEL LIKE THEY ARE WASTING YOUR TIME. YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE WASTING YOUR TIME SURE, BUT TO SAY IT TO THEIR FACE NUMEROUS TIMES? UNACCEPTABLE. I WILL NEVER TAKE MY SERVICE TO T-MOBILE. WHO WANTS METRO SERVICE ANYWAYS.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1547578851190, 'text': 'Chyanne I am terribly sorry for the experience you had at our store I will be sure to talk to my team and the mobile expert that helped you out .

I got my name put on a list and then I stood in line for over an hour while 3 other people behind me in line were seen. They need another location so they can handle their customers faster. It sucks having only one place in town to go to.</text>

<Review>Do NOT fall for their leasing scam. We were told we were making payments on our phone every month so we didn't have to pay it all at once. Turns out a year later now that they say we owe $200 on each phone or we can get a new phone and start all over with a new lease or we can just turn in the phones all together. Just BS this was not told to us.</Review>< user_id>

<Review>Very worse customer service after purchase, ...no response after purchase done..

During your purchase of service be careful, verbally they offer you free accessories, but they are adding those all in your monthly payment plan, which you paying back to them in payments with interest. After sign the service they don’t response very well and there manager not come to front for resolve the issue. I had very bad experience with this store. I been there 3 time to resolve issue and call then 6 time my issue not resolved and I cancelled my service.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><rate>1<//rate>< GmapID>

Excellent customer service, except waiting times are long. Neat store with friendly staff. Not a great idea to go after 4pm. Best deals in town and also variety of cases, and accesories  for iphone and android operating sistems. I must say they  are a little expensive but last for a long time.If they can't help you inside the store, they will direct you to their customer service line , to further assist you. Great insurance and replacement options for your device.</text>

I had a million questions and he Raman was able answer all of them and he showed me all the speakers and said what he thought of all of them and based on that I went with the tmobIle pink megaboom speaker. He is a great asset to TMobile and we also bought head set tone for my son a 180 dollar value and would trust Raman''s expertise on all your products.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

< Review>
They hustle you, they start grabbing all kinds of accessories like a case, screen protector, and car charger, I asked are these free and get a yes but end up charging you for them, when you confront them about it they play dumb. When I went to use my phone insurance they told me it was gonna cost about $400. Called tmobile customer service and they said no it cost nothing that's the point of insurance. Store told me i couldnt have it shipped to my house, ok no big deal. Went to pick up the replacement that was shipped to the store and they tried to charge me some $200 fee, called tmobile again and they said no theres no fee and told me i could of had it shipped to my house.< /Review>

<Text>have been using this place for one year. The manager was rude. No respect. He acted like debt collector. We are looking for other parking.
I was not notified that I should pay everyday. I was asked to pay when I leave. I already paid $ 700 for one month. Then I had a plan to pay for another one month later. I did it today and we moved our truck to other place. We will NEVER come back.
Oh, I forgot to tell you that they take CASH only.< /Text><gmapID>0x80c29419e7cbf833:0xb5c3ea6197487ced<//gmapID>< pictures>

Besides that this place is way overpriced, they tell you that you can pay when you decide to leave, I guess because he was too lazy to write an invoice for me (not to mention that the invoice is some bs wrote by hand by the guardian). I offered to pay in the evening when I got back to my truck and the guardian said, no worries, you can pay tomorrow when you leave. “Tomorrow” I wake up, go to eat something in the area and when I come back, surprise! My wheel was locked and I had a sign on the windshield. I go to the front, of course no sign of security, I call that nasty man who always have an attitude over the phone and I ask for help at my parking number. He said someone will be there shortly. After 10 minutes, some security guy comes that doesn’t even speak English and asked me if I understand Russian and tells me that I have a balance and I cannot leave until I pay it. This is BS service and BS price. Luckily they are the only place in this area of LA, otherwise, nobody will come to stay here. I won’t come here again. Petro in the other side of LA is 24$/night and has facilities also! Never coming back!<//Text>

<Text>Heads up, this is not a "nice" part of LA, but these guys were very helpful. Full privacy fence, armed guards, private lot. We spent the first night on site, the rock yard next door is loud in the morning but that's out of everyone's controll. But for the hours reset, we were able to drop the trailer and not worry about graffiti/theft. Worth the $ every time. They even held the space for us if we paid multiple days. (No reservations though)</Text>< Time>

Armed security that constantly patrol you 'll know your truck and load is safe. The staff is friendly and multi-lingual. $40 a day rate for piece of mind. I stopped and used so I could go see some Los Angeles sights. Uber is close at hand. I'll be a repeat customer- green beard< /text>

I can't say the place is bad. If you need to store your semi it's probably a god send in the greater LA area but I went under the impression they also did over night pay to park. That said there was no guard when I pulled my rig in and was half parked before someone said anything. Now I was almost out of time so was almost willing to shell out 40 bucks to park for the night and chalk it up to bad planning but the take nothing but cash. So if you are in DESPERAT need it could work but avoid if you just need to park for the night.</review>

Heads up guys, I saw this on my Google Maps app but not on the truck stop guide in my hand, so I called to see if there was a charge to park. $40 per day. According to a guy who has posted on here before me, they have dirty bathrooms and no showers. I'm not stopping here, showers are a must. Safe travels!</Text>

{'time': 1567093426589, 'text': 'Hello Matt, it is actually just a flat rate of $40 daily, nothing plus or additional to the $40. We tell you the price before you park so it is up to you to stay or leave before having to pay. We give a fair price considering the expenses of 24/7 Armed Security, Security Cameras, as well as our prime location. You can feel free to go to other truck stops where you might be able to park for "free" as long as you Pay for fuel. Thank you for your business. Best of luck.'}< /resp>

$40 plus for 10 hour break why just go 25 miles up the road to castaic you might get lucky get one at the pilot but there's two other places it cost only $15 plus you get like five hours free parking at the castaic truck stop.<//Text>

<Text>40.00 is a good price to park your truck in safe location the hotels her expensive so for room and board and security that's a great price there's a pilot about 10 miles for showers & as truck drivers we don't always have restrooms so that shouldn't be a issue the staff is friendly and very helpful I'll come here again but hey you can't please everybody nobody is ever satisfied if you looking for a good parking spot this would be your place< /Text><UserId.>112980522874597533882< /UserId.>< response>

<review>I can not say enough about the kindness and generosity of the people at interfaith they are simply put.. AMAZING. I just recently had a run of bad luck and needed some help I had just moved back to California from Texas after being gone for a few years so when I got my roots and Grass Valley I looked up Interfaith they far exceeded my expectations, just genuinely good people. I hope they know how much they are appreciated I cannot believe how much food they gave me it is just amazing.</review>< pictures>

Absolutely LOVE this place and the community they help support! Life is tough and often our family, friends and neighbors are unexpectedly faced with hardships this time of year. This year is certainly no exception! Programs like these and the people who help facilitate the operations are truly selfless! It was an honor to be invited to work alongside you guys, see y'all next year!!</review>

Absolutely love this place and the support behind it. Everyone needs food, a lot of us need help at some point in life. Make it a happier holiday season for someone if you can! 2020 toy drive and dinner donation was a major hit!</text>

<review>Fast, great, healthy and a Blessing each and every time I go. Without IFM my family would be eating beans and rice  out of every month. I thank God every day for all the wonderful people at IFM, especially the Board members  and the selfless, charitable volunteers that make it possible for them to aquire,, sort,, package and distributea all the wonderful  provisions we receive at every visit along with our holiday meals.  They are so gracious and caring about the work they do for us.  Thank you IFM.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

They give  decent food that is nutritious and large portions too  and if you have a request or a special need they almost bend over backward to help you as best as possible in every way I've been so very impressed with there process it's always smooth and easy and the people that volunteer are so nice ehen dropping off to friends I am  proud that the nutritious food they have collected is top shelf and supplied with love in there hearts kudos to all who work ,volunteer, and use the interfaith ministries services  there giving family's and people that need a hand up and at some times in life I think we all need s little help and they make you feel comfortable to give there hand to help lift you up a day or week a month or even a year whatever it takes till your on your feet again they give support and we all can use a hand and support  this is the place to go you can feel there hearts warmth and the strength of there hand as they reach out and help you stand on your own two feet and feel proud and happy again if you need food a year to listen or maybe a lesson how to make more out of the food you buy or get from them so you can keep your loved ones healthy happy and content thank you over and over from me and from my friends</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>I can't say enough great things about this lovely place. They actually care about people and make a difference in people's lives for the better. If it wasn't for this wonderful giving, caring place I don't know where my family would be now. They care about the community and the people in it. God bless this place!< /review></record>

Every time I have visited IFM, the people serving have been friendly and helpful. Every person is treated with kindness and respect. The place may be crazy busy but no one is turned away. They offer healthy food, including fresh produce, along with occasional treats.</text>

<text>They have to be 5star.. They help feed the hungry, homeless, give free diapers for your baby. They are open 3 days per week every week and help out with your holiday dinners so you and, your family have dinner for the holidays.  Oh, just to mention they also give free baby formulas. No one else does that ,that I know of.

Anyways, the area is a little rough so they are skeptical of their clients hut they have WIGS, MAKEUP, CLOTHES, AND BASIC ACCESORIES.  My parents retired in this neighborhood and its and up and coming great old partnof Bakersfield<//text>< Pics>

<text>I highly recommend Chester Mart for every clothing you need , from kids clothing to teens to adult clothing . Been shopping here for over 7 to 8 years owners on location everyday and very friendly helpful with everything . Stop by and get your pro clubs , Shaka and streetwise shirts  . Also in need of shorts and some new Van's.  Save the rest and stop by and take a look . #spenssa<//text>< name>

< Review>
Refused to exchange black dickies work pants with an obvious factory defect as the pants hadn't been worn. Just wanted to exchange them. Not only did the man and woman refuse but also became verbally and then physically aggressive with me because I told them it was bad business and I was going to give bad reviews.. The woman actually approached me and attempted to grab the pants from me as I was leaving, claiming to want to take a picture. Totally inappropriate behaivor for a small buisness owner!  I change my recommendation to shop at this store!</Review>

<response>{'time': 1562127216237, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear about your recent experience. The pants that were brought in for an exchange were torn approximately 10 inches along the seam. They also looked as though they had been worn, due to being covered in dust and debris, despite the fact that they were purchased only four days prior. We thoroughly inspect items at the counter before we fold them and bag them for our customers. Our staff also has video evidence of this specific article of clothing being tried on before it was purchased in the store, and it is simply not possible that a 10 inch tear in the pants would go unnoticed by the customer and the employees. We are more than willing to exchange new items with factory defects. However, in this case, it was not a manufacture defect and was clearly damaged by the customer after the purchase. We cannot accommodate damages made to our products after purchase.'}<//response><GmapID>0x80ea6a2330370821:0xfa971512ad6be6ea< /GmapID></record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>This is not spam. The five star reviews are fake and only put on here to try and make them look better. They haven't provided service to most of the five star reviews and they are FAKE.

No this company has never provided service to me and I will admit that from the get go. When someone owns a business or has a bad person working for them it reflects on the rest of the business. Especially when said worker likes to harass and accuse someone of being racist and starting a huge amount of grief in that poor man's life. You want to stop getting bad reviews? I would suggest you go apologize to the one that was wronged. You chose to try and wrongfully end that guys career by claiming he is racist, maybe yours should end then instead.< /text>< pictures>

<Date>1558977234575< /Date><rate>5</rate><text>This is by far the best limo service transportation company in the Coachella Valley. Not only did the driver, Anthony Garcia, called us days before the event to confirm the location and to get additional details of our event, he showed up 20 mins early and was ready to be at service. Anthony’s accommodating, understanding and more importantly thoughtful for what our specific needs were, made the experience pleasant. I’ve been in business for over ten years, and finding partners who provide the top tier service like Anthony and his company did, made our day. I will not use any other service and suggest using them for every one of your transportation needs!!</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1569776997862, 'text': 'Thank you ...nice doing business with you'}</Response><Gmap_id>0x80db2232d23a101b:0x1b319ee7026c3b3d< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Tried to harass a pharmacist for no reason. Company is trash.

Edit in response to owner:
So you tried to affect someone's place of work and now that it's backfiring, it's wrong all of a sudden? Also, you did provide service for a quince I was involved with and service was subpar. Hummer was late, back area was dirty, car was super hot.<//Text>< Pics>

unprofessional company who bullies individuals, and then gets mad when you call them out? try addressing your mistakes instead of copying and pasting the same tired response on every review.</review>

Bring cash though.  They don't take credit cards.   That's my only complaint.</text>

<Text>Had an awesome experience. Needed a full set last minute to replace a mani and I had no appt. She allowed me a walk in on the spot and smashed out the whole set in 40 minutes. This was 4 WEEKS ago and I JUST got them filled. No chips, no repairs, and color still DAZZLING. Her next appointment showed up 15 minutes in and she worked under pressure from her customer and they STILL came out FLAWLESS! 10/10 would recommend and will return if I'm ever in Twentynine Palms again!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< GmapID>

She was ripping nails existing acrylic nails off with a nail form. It hurt so so bad and when I told her to stop she complained and then finally let them soak. Very rude and very unprofessional. I do not recommend. Don’t waste your money.<//review>

People were friendly and the lady was very knowledgeable in working with my thin, gel-damaged nails (+2 stars). That said, the place was in desperate need of an update; chairs were dilapidated and torn, and the place could really benefit from a fresh coat of paint (-1 star). The worst part of our experience was my daughter getting burned by the wax (-2 stars).</review>

Loved coming here. When I first walked in I was greated and told it would be a 10 min wait. I'm not sure if I even waited 10 min. It took my nail tech less then an hr to do a fill with gel and file my nail shape to make it more even. This was my first time here and I'm 100% coming back!</Text>

I love the way my nails came out. They are beautiful! Definitely the place to go in town. I've been to multiple other salons in town, which either do a 'ok' job so try to upsell you. Echo Nails, I will be coming back! Thank you.<//Review>

My first time coming here to get my eyebrows done. I believe her name was Leland but I could be wrong on the spelling. She did a great job and was friendly, quick, and efficient. I just moved back to 29 and I think I found my new eyebrow place.<//text>

<Text>My first time there and it was great. The woman who did my nails went above and beyond my expectations. I got a pedi as well and let me tell you my legs and feet never felt better. And I got waxed which didn’t hurt at all. Overall I will be making this my nail place!< /Text>< Pictures>

If I can rate this place zero stars I would. The pictures on their website are deceiving. They messed up on the design, didn’t do anything I asked for and when I wanted to add something the guy didn’t want to do them because he didn’t like how they look. Definitely won’t come back.<//Review>

Came here to just get my eyebrows done and the staff greated me right as I walked in. They were not very busy so the woman told me it would be about five minutes. She was very gentle when waxing and did a great job. I asked her to keep then thick and thats exactly how she did them. Definitely recommend them.<//review>

Do not go there for nail removal they literally rip them off without even soaking them which hurts like a sob. They pry another nail tip under it and rip.  They also make the acrylic very thick looks tacky.< /review>

I've heard good and bad about this place. I think it depends on who you get. My experience was horrible. My manicure was done very poorly. It wasn't opaque and wasn't painted all around the nail so it looked sloppy. It started chipping the next day. Wouldn't go back.<//review>

I really wish that I could give them a -0, because this nail shop is not professional, they are poor quality, and poor communication. The reason my I selected all the above is because, the new little girl that took over she want to raise the price and the quality of the work is not worthy of the price increase. They half do your nails, for example, they half paint your toes nails and then get mad and start talking in they language. When you tell they to paint your full toe nail. I will not go back they again .< /review>

I’ve had places that have cut down my cuticles too much and those where better experiences. This place also didn’t cut down my cuticles they rushed cutting down my natural nails, rushed adding the acrylics, rushed adding the color, and yeah the end product looks rushed I’m too embarrassed to even take a picture of them for social media. Just very disappointed, they where really nice and I tipped them well but I won’t be returning here probably ever.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<text>This place is unprofessional and will be reported to the Better Business Bureau. I would give them a zero rating.  I’ve never had to do this to any business in this valley. Long story short.  I went to pay with my debit card and their machine would not work. The lady attempted to process my card 3-4 times without any success. She directed me to the ATM machine inside of Stater Bros. I agreed to do so even though it was highly inconvenient. It was very cold and dark outside. Also, because I had my 9 year old daughter with me. It was my daughters first experience getting her nails polished. I figured I’d just hurry and get cash and bring it back as she suggested. I started to leave the store but realized she followed both my daughters and I to the parking lot and began harassing me to leave my daughter with her! I thought she was kidding at first but then she started yelling at me to leave my daughter in the salon while I left to get money! This lady had to be delusional! My services were a total of $40 and leaving my child unattended by people I do not know was not happening! It wasn’t my fault that their ATM machine wasn’t working properly! At this point I felt unsafe as my daughter started crying as this woman continued to argue with me in the parking lot! I refused as any mother would and I was extremely upset that any decent person would suggest this and be aggressive about it! I had to remain calm in front of my daughter. I threw my phone near the front of the salon door in an attempt for her to leave us alone and said I’ll be back with your money! Keep my phone! My daughter was shaking and in tears! I left to Stater Bros and got cash. I returned to the store and threw the money on the counter. The story doesn’t end here. Apparently when I left to the store... my husband called me and this evil woman had the nerve to answer my phone! She told him that I owed them money and my payment was $40. My husband was so confused. He rushed to the salon because he felt it was suspicious!
This place is evil and should not be in business. Please stay far away from this salon. They are crooked, unprofessional, and don’t care about people or families. I’m a mother  of 4 children  and a teacher  of 18 years in this valley.... I wanted to do and say so much more to this woman but I had my daughter with me. She deserved so much more. One way to feel justified and seeking justice is by sharing my truth and  protecting others from this awful place! Please DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BEHAVIOR by finding  another place to get your nails done!
Thank you.<//text><Name>Martha Murrieta< /Name>< Date>

<text>This is my mother's nail salon and I started going with her for pedicures. The owner Kim is a lovely person and is great at what she does. Vince has given me my pedicures and does a great job.
The atmosphere is relaxed very clean and the prices are reasonable. I found it to be an overall enjoyable experience.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I went there yesterday with my friend and I have personally been there before and never had any complaints which is why I went back they had one client there before me and my friend and they couldn’t stop bouncing around which already made me feel anxious. Then it came time to do my nails and the lady started and half way through mine she tells me they were going to switch and the guy was going to take over. At the time I was like okay weird but oh well and I let him take over. It was the worst nail experience I have ever had. He continuously hurt me and my nails look horrible. They are bumpy some are bent a little at the tip. Then when I went to pay he charged me 85$ for two full sets. Which I understand that’s most places now days but their prices are not 45$ for a full set if you get a shape if you get two colors they go up. It’s ridiculous! If you are going to ask someone do you want a shape you should also make them aware it will cost 5$ more. I was going to talk to them about my issues I was having but honestly just wanted out of there and I definitely won’t be going back.< /Review>

Only 3 people working on a Saturday and no one in there. I should have known better when it was so empty. The massage chair didn’t work and although the lady was very nice that did my pedicure it was quick and not very thorough. I will not be going back.<//review>

I wanted "pink & white" gels and they did not have a certain tool needed.  Soooooo, I had to get the tips painted white, which certainly is not the same.  With every question, the price got higher and higher.<//Review>

Brought my daughter & found it to be a bad experience. Couple of their employees bring their children to work, the children cry & run all over the place. One of the children kept getting the nail polishes, dropping them & braking them. What an unprofessional place. Will not come back & will not recommend this place.</review>

What a terrible experience it was my first time there I got a pedicure with a guy name Tom I told him how I want my toes done and he didn't understand what I asked for. I told one of the girls who worked there and she told the owner who went to cut my toenails and all the dry skin but she was done she told Tom to finish which was so wrong he was rude painted my toenails horrible I will never go back to this place how soon I got home I removed the nail polish. I wasted $20 dollars</Text>

<review>Just recently went to this shop for the first time because I was referred through a friend and this is now the only shop I will be going too for any work done on my truck. Chris gave me a detailed explanation of what was wrong with my truck and fixed it with no hesitation. The entire staff is friendly and overall was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this shop & they have definitely gained a full time customer!<//review><gmapID>0x80dcb2b3c1371e85:0xa37c2f481291e04f</gmapID>< rating>

<review>Chris and Joel know their trucks. They give you a no nonsense, detailed explanation of what’s going on with your truck, and do an amazing job. Never had to go back with an issue over a repair they have done. The professionalism there is amazing. You won’t regret taking your truck there.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

After being told by a different shop they would take over three days to "get to my truck" A mechanic told me about JACK's. Chris, had me out on the road by the next day. I won't go anywhere else.

They get me in, they dont rape my pocket book, they are straight forward mechanics. They are always willing to help troubleshoot issues over the phone as well, just to keep me rolling, because as we all know "If those wheels arent turning we arent a earning"
Thank you Jack Diesel for Keeping Redman Van & Storage Rolling.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>The employees are very polite, but not very helpful or educated. I wanted a copy of my CT scan and they told me I had to wait for my doctor to review it first. There is absolutely no logic behind this. That is my medical record and my right to see my results. I wasn’t able to get an explanation of this logic, only that this was “the rule”.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Best prices across Bakersfield. Quest is just awesome you take it prices, staff, timelines, call them each and every step was just wonderful experience for me.  Front end staff are very friendly same as advisors, technicians even the training staff each and everyone are just awesome. I think I had the best experience and suggest everyone to visit them if there is a requirement. God bless everyone and keep away from all medical needs everyone should be healthy. But if there is a need I would suggest Quest.< /text>

<text>I had a great experience I was a little scared to go .I'm glad I did .they are practicing and following through with the social distancing and very clean .there service was outstanding .then the procedure I had done was a scary one that I didn't 5hibk I'd be able to finish it.it turned out I was wrong my 2 nurse's were amazing they talked to me the hole time keeping me focused and because of them 2 ladies I was able to finish the hole test without having to stop.they helped me clean up after and made sure I was good before I left.the doctor was a nice man he talked to me telling me what he was doing and kept me in the loop during the hole procedure.if I can choose my self on where to get my imaging done I'd definitely choose them every time.</text><pics>None< /pics><Date>1600575883168<//Date></record>

Went for an ultrasound, after waiting 45 minutes past appointment time, I checked and was told the tech was busy, but they should get to me shortly.  After another 15 minutes I left, nice people up front, clueless and are definitely disorganized and out of touch with their business.</Review>

All of the staff were very kind and understanding. I didn't want to go home. I work 2 jobs and I felt so comfortable there, that during my MRI I was able to relax and get a good 15 minutes of rest. Lol Yes I would definitely go back. They made me feel like family. Thank you for an awesome staff and visit.<//Review>

I was there for a CT scan. Everything ran on time and very professional. The registration process was efficient. The staff in  the  CT/MRI area were professional and attentive. The process was over rather quickly and I was on my way. I will continue to use Quest Imaging when the need presents it self.</Review>

I am 68 years old and this was my first experience with having to get an ex-ray. Everyone from the front desk to administration to the ex-ray technician were very professional and informative. The ex-technician told me what she was going to do and why, and what I need to do. This information made the whole process go smoothly and easily for me.<//Review>

< Review>
I had an ultrasound and biopsy and everything went so well as explained by the wonderful staff.  Cheryl is tops in making me feel comfortable and well taken care of.  My only complaint is the lack of coordination between Quest and Kaiser for the mammogram at the Chester facility.  It took 4 month to get the mammogram scheduled.  I am not sure who dropped the ball at Chester Quest and Kaiser but intend to find out and I hope you do too.< /Review>

<review>Overall I had a very positive experience at Quest Imaging. The staff was professional and friendly and the waiting areas were very nice. I especially was appreciative of how nice the women's health wing was. It was clean, very centered towards women (women's magazines and HGTV on the tv), the dressing room and the restroom were very nice, and overall this area made me feel more at ease about the reason I was there. The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is because I wasn't taken back for my imagine until 30 minutes after my appointment and there was no communication. If an office is running behind, I totally understand, but would appreciate being told when checking in for my appointment so I can make sure I can make arrangements for my other obligations.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>My experience was far greater than expected. Was able to get the tests done even though I was a week late (my fault not theirs) because I got appointments mixed.

I had a great experience starting from the moment I walked in. My doctor ordered a stat exam and they got me in right away, they talked with the Tech and he was very accommodating even though they had a full schedule they still made way. The girl that registered me took me back right away and was very compassionate. When she called the scheduler to put me on the schedule the scheduler was very helpful and compassionate as well, the whole time I was there everybody had a great smile on their face and I just felt welcomed. When I was in the back with the Tech I thanked him for getting me in right away. He smiled and just said it was his pleasure. I felt at ease and really felt the love of God through these guys. Thank you all for your hard work and for letting God shine through you!< /Text>

Cons
- did not like having only one waiting room for their MRI machines. As a female, I was not comfortable sitting in a hospital gown around men.
- scheduling an appointment was difficult. Their main appointment line was all computerized. Finally found another number to get a real person on the phone.

Pros
- good service
- great staff
- clean facility
-quick turn around time on imaging</review>

<review>I have always had friendly, professional and timely care at Quest. We live in a rural mountain area an hour outside of Bakersfield and they do their best to accommodate me with appointments when I’m in town or when I already have a trip into town planned.
The staff are all so kind & reports get to my doctors so quickly.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I like the ambiance of Quest. It feels like your at a Day Spa. Everyone are very nice and helpful. I came for a mammogram. I didn't have to wait very long. Doing the test was fine. The tech was very concerned that I was comfortable thru the whole process. Everything was great. I do tell people to have their test done at Quest.<//Text>

<Text>They are some of the most professional and nice people you will meet anywhere in the medical world. From the initial greeting, to handling the paperwork, meeting nurses and docs, the experience could not be any better. Everything was explained clearly, and you get the impression that they really do care about delivering wonderful service.  So, you can rest assured this is a great facility.  H.

Quest Imaging is one of the few medical services that posts the results of your test promptly! It is such a relief to get your test results within a few days and not have to wonder for weeks. The Stockdale location is the best facility in Bakersfield.</Review>

<Review>This office is fantastic! The staff,  the nurses, the X-ray technicians, are all Pleasant, professional, and all share a caring attitude towards the patients whom they serve. Even without an appointment, the wait time is never very long and they always keep you apprised of what's going on. I would recommend this office to anyone who is looking for very professional care.<//Review>< pics>

<text>When I go to Quest Imaging on Stockdale Highway I am greeted with respect and kindness, and through the whole process I am treated with Respect and Kindness.
And when I am all done with the procedure I am told to have a Blessed Day and kindly told and shown how to exit the building.

If Covered California hadn't limited my options, this would continue to be the preferred place to get my exams and biopsies. They have always and consistently treated me with respect and provide a wonderful room for women awaiting to get their mammograms and other tests. Staff explain what they are doing and do what they can to lessen any discomfort.</Text>

How strange that there are so many negative reviews.  I have been going to Quest Imaging on Stockdale Hwy every time there was a need and the staff have been efficient, friendly, polite and just wonderful.  Never was there once an unpleasant incidence.  As with all, if  you show them respect, they return the same.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I was at quest imaging on 21st of March for a CAT Scan with and without contrast.  I was treated with respect, compassion, and empathy.   And concern was not phony.  I am highly  claustropic and they made me feel at ease. Several different individuals from receptionist to nurse to CAT tech were welcoming answered all my questions and made sure I understood procedure and what to expect.  Each were right on. They made sure that the disc from Kern radiology was downloaded and returned plus provided me with CD from the CAT scan. They had results from BUN and creatinine which was down at Stephen strategos’s Office. I had a pleasing and very positive experience.<//Text>< Pics>

From beginning to end, scheduling, check-in and mammogram tech were all extremely professional, knowledgeable and pleasant.  They made  the experience much more bearable than your typical mammogram. Thank you!<//text>

I have been going to Quest Imaging for many years.  The staff is always nice, the wait is not bad at all, and it's a lovely facility. I highly recommend women come here for 3D Mammograms.  My husband comes for xrays and my brother goes there to have his nephrostomy tube changed.  Five star ratings from us!!!!!!<//text>

I was scheduled for a couple of untrasounds, which they said would take approximately 1:15 to complete. I was in and out in less than 40 minutes! Nice facility and people!</text>

<Text>Staff was pleasant and the checkin was efficient and the waiting room was comfortable. I am glad they don’t keep rooms too cold because it’s hard to wear just a thin gown in a cold room. I was a new patient in 2016.< /Text><user_name>Esther M< /user_name>< user_id>

The only problem I encountered was the scheduling. I was initially told by a live person that my appointment would be at 7:45 a.m.  Later, I received a recording stating my appointment time as 7:45 a.m. but to arrive at 7:15.  Still later, I received another recording stating that my appointment time was 8:30 a.m but to arrive by 8:00 a.m.

Naturally, I didn't want to be late so I arrived at 7:15 a.m.  After completing the paperwork, I proceeded to wait while another person was taken to an office for processing. Soon, a staff member approached me, asked me what time my appointment was and reassured me that I would be next.  I learned that another patient who was also waiting had also received dual recordings. A staff member apologized for the recording mixup but my appointment was at the later time of 8:30 a.m.

I was not angry but this type of error should not be happening, especially so early in the morning.  This review is intended only to alert staff of the problem. Once my appointment time arrived, I received excellent care with only one hiccup of another wait time between tests.< /Text>

Quest Imaging is the ONLY place I go. Their staff is courteous, the registration process is fast, they are very professional and they do everything they can to get you in and on your way as quickly as possible.< /text>

It is interesting to me that some people have published negative reviews.  I have many health problems and as a result have been to Quest Imaging many times for many different types of studies.  I have always found the staff to courteous, friendly and professional.  I guess everyone has a bad day now and then.< /review>

<Review>Do NOT come here for an pregnancy ultrasound. They would not let me back to view so I missed out on seeing the sex of my first child. Even though we are married they would not let me back. My wife pleaded with the ultrasound tech to let me back, to no avail. Screw this place they are insensitive. They ruined what should have been a happy memory for me and my wife.</Review><userid>103582408393727993586< /userid></record></dataset><record>

I was told I would get a 45 min heads up to pick up my mom after a 4 hour scan, nobody called. She had to wait an additional 45 min, all without eating the entire day. Thanks for the "customer service".<//Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The doctor who attended me fatal teach stacey tarango I do not recommend the place for ultrasound
I am 5 months old and he did not tell me if he is going to be a boy or a girl, and it took him about 1 hour to take measures
I think it was learning or new
