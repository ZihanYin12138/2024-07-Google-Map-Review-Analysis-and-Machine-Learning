I had the BEST experience with this shop! Time was taken to figure out exactly what I was looking for and I feel like they went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable. I left feeling like a whole new woman with the confidence of a superstar. I traveled 2.5 hours and I will be back for sure. Thank you ladies for everything and I"ll be seeing you again soon!< /review>

<review>OMFG SAMANTHA HOOKED ME UP! Not only was I contacted right away for a consultation through email, I was given a next day appointment. I walked in, my stylist was just finishing up someone and sat me down as soon as she disinfected the chair real good after the other customer. It is a nice atmosphere, she will treat you like family ladies! I will be coming back here! The price was GREAT and you wont be in there all day. Thanks so much Express Weave Bar. They are my lifeline rn. I will never go anywhere else. See you at my maintenance appointment Samantha!< /review>< pictures>

Not professional with scheduling appointments. Company seldomly gets back to you on requests and when company finally messages/email you back they still never follow through with an appointment date/time if unable to complete on requested date/time. I’ve been trying to coordinate a time/date for about 3weeks now. I gave up and decided to go elsewhere. If unable to accommodate a date/time just let the customers know so they can shop elsewhere.< /review>

My first experience with a weave ever and I’m happy to have found this place. The owner is very good about getting your appointment fast, she returned all of my texts in a timely manner and was extremely helpful with explaining to me all of the products and services offered...not to mention it’s literally all on the website...and same day/ next day service you can’t beat that! Her prices are absolutely reasonable offering something within everyone’s price range and the quality of the work is unbeatable! The stylist who I had the privilege of meeting today made me feel comfortable and at ease. She made sure to understand what I wanted and explained what technique she thought was best. I was afraid that the braiding process was going to be hurt. I honestly didn’t feel her pull none of my hair in the braiding process and the braids came out neat and just right. She seemed to be a natural sewing the wefts of hair on. My overall experience was excellent and I would definitely recommend this place...

Also COVID-19 precautions were followed masks were worn at all times...the salon was clean and smelled sanitized..and hand sanitizer was offered.<//Review>

I would love to give more stars as Tara did a great job of installing my sew-in weave. Prior and during my installation I kept repeating that I did not want a lot of hair and I did not want to see the tracks in my head. After installation, I could see track in the crown. I was told to go get a bottle of L’Oréal hair color and spray it in. That made no sense to me, so I didn’t do it. After a week, when my hair is getting old and settled, I realized just how thick it really was. There were too many tracks put in (not what I wanted. Opposite of what I had expressed). I then texted the shop and Shevon texted me back saying I needed to schedule a maintenance appointment. That was not what I wanted. I just wanted some of the tracks taken out! I then called the shop and ended up in a verbal confrontation with this young lady. I don’t want to put labels on people, but she kept emphasizing the price. Not once did I tell her I didn’t want to pay. She just assumed I wanted something for free! Does she, on behalf of the shop, not have enough money???  I hope whoever reads this review will feel me and take these comments to heart. Go there, get your service, pay your money, leave and DO NOT EXPECT ASSISTANCE if you should need it later!  Also, the young lady said I should have called within 3 days of getting my hair done if I needed any adjustments. That was NEVER told to me, yet it was an argument with her!!< /Text>

<Review>Ghetto ghetto ghetto. The owner is ghetto and so are some of the girls working there. The music they play right along with the conversations the stylists have don’t belong in a shop setting but they do kids hair. God forbid you’re unhappy with your hair. You can’t fix hair that’s done completely wrong because they don’t know what they’re doing. Better off flushing your money down the toilet. You can see just how ghetto the place is by the way the owner responds to constructive criticism. Acting like people lied about even coming there, telling them she don’t even remember then, telling people she glad they’re not coming back. How she acts on here  sums up how the shop is.

I will absolutely be back! Normally, when you go to the hair shop, you can expect to be there for hours and hours. Not only was the service quick but my weave has been in over a month and it is still in good shape and also nice and tight. I will definitely be back.</Review>

Her braiding was great and the sewn was so neat and flat, not bulky. The atmosphere was fun and welcoming. The stylist there are fabulous.

< Review>
So me and my friend were in Sacramento visiting from Los Angeles and we really needed our hair done. I google weaving salons online and express weaves came up with good reviews so I scheduled an appointment. Usually I get uncomfortable if there are a lot of people or loud chatter in a salon but express had minimal noise and the stylists were entertaining and professional. I loved the way our hair looked when we left.!!<//Review>

<review>It's only been 2 days and my braids are coming undone and I have loose tracks. I've had to re-sew areas that were never sewn near my leave out. I mean the whole thing was an awful ordeal. Despite having an appointment, I had to wait nearly an hour and half to be serviced. This place was recommended by a friend who received great service and a quality sew in. I'm incredibly disappointed. The only think I'm happy about is the color (that I did) and the cut from my stylist. I just felt the whole thing was unprofessional. Not to mention there is nothing express about this place. I came with washed and dried hair and was still here for nearly 5 hours.  I will NEVER get service from here again.

Just to clarify, I didn't have a walk in appointment, I scheduled two week prior.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I traveled to Sacramento for my sons high school graduation and needed my hair done asap.  I was put in touch with a stylist, Nai who was willing to do my hair last minute! I am so grateful she fit me in her schedule. I got a wash and flat-iron. She was very friendly, and collaborated with me on how I wanted my hair straightened and styled. I was so surprised by how silky and straight she got my hair...and still had body! I look forward to flying her out to Seattle to do my hair! Thank you Nai! and the Express Weave Bar team!<//Text>

I purchased raw Indian hair and fell in love. I originally ordered a 10 inch for a curly bob. The hair was extremely soft and light. I then ordered the 16 inch for a little spice. I am beyond happy. I have always been disappointed with extreme tangling from curly hair that I purchased from other distributors.  The hair a purchased and installed has not shedded is tangle free. The price was a great deal also.< /text>

{'time': 1488936470106, 'text': "So many holes in your story honey. A 5hr install? Impossible. We had several late appts that Saturday which is not your fault. So I AGAIN apologize for the delay. We should of had you come later.\n\nYou had a 360 frontal installed that takes 2.5-3 hrs usually.  The frontal slide off? You said it was down with thread except for the adhesive lifted (very normal)when we spoke. I was speechless because I have never heard of anyone taking a weave down bc less than 2 inches of lace lifted. I know this was your 1st 360 and it was overwhelming.. However you never gave us the opportunity to 'fix' anything. You said you would call when you returned to town. That was when we were going to talk about doing your hair again... So this review is totally unwarranted. We're happy you choose not to step foot in here again, as I don't see how I could have made you happy.. Which is our ONLY goal when it comes to our clients. But again, we need to be given that chance. As any business would. 😊\n\nWe wish you well in your future weave endeavors and thank you for giving us a try!!"}< /response>
<Review>Had an appointment with Express Weave bar on 2.25.2017 for a trip out of town for the following weekend. I had a lace frontal installed, first off there was nothing express about it. It took nearly 5  hours and did not turn out so great.. but they were friendly and tried I guess and for the price I paid and amount of time I sat I was willing to deal with it. 3.4.2017 I'm out of town on my trip and the FRONTAL SLIDES OFF! Hadn't lasted a full week, I immediately called the shop and the owner was unavailable. I waited a couple hours for a return call for her to tell me "they don't do refunds, and you are supposed to touch it up every 2-4 weeks.." I reminded her that it had not been a week.. Her response was oooo.
I'll never step foot in there again, it's a joke and a rip off.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><rate>1<//rate>< Date>

I brought my Daughter in for Prom. The ladies greeted us and took her within 15 min upon arrival. Tara did an excellent job with my daughters hair( my daughter showed her a pic of what she wanted) and Tara did just that and then some. Shavaun did her makeup and had her looking so stunning. I recommend this place. They are fast yet very efficient. Oh and I enjoyed a Minosa while I waited for my Girl. We will be back and I'm hopefully next.

Thank you again ladies for a wonderful 1st time experience!

She was Slayed!!!! 💋</Review>

Michael was able to completely restore my hair that was falling off, and gave me the right instructions to avoid this in the future.
Great service and people.<//review>

Love the people here! I've never had a bad experience. I love the "family" orientated feel I get everytime I go. The prices are great, and the stylist are awesome without skimping on quality. They try their hardest to make sure you are taken care of within a timely manner and I always appreciate that.

Special shout out to Tara whose been doing my hair for over a year now! You keep me lookin fly girl, and the growth of my hair has been ridiculous!

Will continue to refer! 😘
Thanks EWB!<//Review>

EWB is awesome place to go n get your hair done. The sylist are very attentive to detail and they make sure the customers needs/wants are met. The energy in the salon is relaxing and postive. I will recommend them to all my friends/co-workers.</review>

<text>I was thinking of setting an appointment but based off the way the business responds to complaints I'm thinking otherwise. Customer blaming and saying you are glad they won't come back is never a good look. Reviews are here for a reason to give consumers an outlet. Yes there are two sides to every story but responsibility has to be shared. I'm very disappointed.</text>< rate>

<Review>This was my first time and I would never ever go back here 1st off I didnt get seen when I was suppose to and not only that I didnt even get my hair done by the person I scheduled with I didnt find out I was getting my hair done by the wrong person until I kept hearing the other stylist call her a different name thats when I asked you not her she gonna tell me oh im sorry we switched clients(who does that) then when I was done my sides was bulky she had to semi fix it cause it was already sewed so theres nothing really you can do I was so upset and on top of that make sure you ask as you go if theres a charge to anything that they ask you want for example DO YOU WANT A CAP ITS BETTER AND YOUR INSTALL WILL LAST ALOT LONGER...by the way I had to take it out 2 days later smh when I went to pay it came out to more than what I was quoted. I didnt even want to give the star I did but I had to just to give my review and experience they get no stars from me. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. AGAIN..NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN. Express bar NOT👎</Review>< pictures>

<text>🚨 u get what u pay for..First mistake trying to give tis salon my business twice. The first visit i was going on vacation to Hawaii & needed a stylist. On my appt day It was rainin the ceiling was leaking EVERYWHERE and I was given a very cold shampoo by the guy Michael, After that I was not confident. He wasn't knowledgeable about coloring hair because he turned my closure pink orange & my sew in looked like i could ve style my own hair. Michael had only 1 client b4 my appt & i literally was at Express Weave Bar for 8hrs!! I even helped him clean so he could be more punctual and get me out the door, shared my pizza after he said he didnt ve no money & was starving. Also from my understanding the Express Weave bar ve a set price for sewins but Michael over charged me $150 for a horrible service & my closure was destroyed. Basically He didnt know how to do a hundred & fifty dollar JOB- seriously rip off. The second mistake was coming back to this place of business to purchase some hair only because of Last Resort. I called the shop someone told me that the owner will be there around 2:30 or 3 with the hair. I got there at 3 no one was there, the owner wasn't even in the area! I drove 30 minutes away & was stood up this is the worst experience I've ever had to go through with a salon, poor customer service. I normally always tip for services but tis was awful and to be honest they cannot do hair don't waste your money or time you will be upset like me thank me later..

Micheal has been gone for some time now, so this had to have happened months ago. The roof DID LEAK in one very small area (by his station).. I can't control a building I don't own.. But its fixed now! :)\n\nI wish you made this complaint to me then, and we would have taken care of you!\n\nBest luck to you Jay Jay."}</Resp>

<Review>This place is great!! My first time here and I was greeted by their employees with complimentary drink while I wait. They are very efficient with their 33 point inspection and gave me all the options for my car needs to make sure that I was safe in driving my car before I left their service department. I definitely recommend this place and will come back.<//Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Service was great the employees here were friendly and polite. I came for an oil change and $80 seems a bit high for me even if its synthetic. I usually change oil myself or at precision auto tune which costs under $40 with synthetic. I also felt like I was offered 10 items that I may have needed but declined, I honestly just needed my oil change and that's it. The wait was over an hour as well</review>

<resp>{'time': 1546892333166, 'text': 'Well we agree a basic oil change should not take 60 minutes, we pride ourselves in offering more than just the basics. In fact, during our 33 point service, we check and top off all major fluids, wash windows, air up your tires and much more. Currently, our average service time is less than 19 minutes (we time every vehicle). You are always welcome to tell us that you just want an oil change. We hope this gives you enough faith to try us again so we can and earn your trust.

<gmapID>0x808f9ef7f4333e35:0xcb259c280f625ad8< /gmapID><review>Hands down the best oil change service I've ever had. I grew up getting my car's oil changed here, and always enjoyed the experience,  but after moving back from Phoenix, I truly appreciate how the staff always goes above and beyond in a way no other business has done.

Communicative, respectful, and informative, they will let you know what the manufacturer recommends, as well as what they professionally recommend depending on your vehicle's mileage. This is in addition to the checks they make on a variety of needs your car may have, ranging from air filters and windshield washer fluid, to power steering and transmission fluid.

I go out of my way to make sure I return to this location when it's time to get an oil change.</review>< username>

<review>I've been here twice and the first time I dropped over $500 to get a bunch of things done to my Audi. The Audi is in great condition but 18 years old so understandingly, it has several leaks and wear and tear. The second time I went in, the technician was finishing up and unknowingly broke a pressure hose and the car would not stay on. It wasn't his fault. Some hoses need to be replaced because of age but nonetheless it caused everyone to worry. They were able to identify the problem and reinserted the hose and the car started.

This morning I moved my car out of my garage and saw that there were oil stains on the floor, most likely from the oil pan. In the confusion, I think they didn't fully tighten the screw so I'll have to go back and get that done. Not a pain but takes time out of my day.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Excellent. You never have to leave your car. Everything happens while you are sitting in the car. All employees were friendly and professional. They recommend additional services based on the mileage/fluid levels, but in a professional way. You can always say no. The best part I think is 100% transparency. They actually show you all the parts before/after replacing, which never happens in other places I have been to(and you can actually see them removing/installing the parts because you are sitting in the car). I will definitely go back next time! The only downside is the wait time depending on the line. I luckily had only one car in front of me and it took about 1.5hrs in total. I think the line moves at a pace of about ~45min~1hr per car.</Review>

Went for an oil changed and loved the service. They were very clear with what they were doing and let me know step by step what was going on. Richard worked with me and did an amazing job. What ruined my day was watching another customer yell at one of the employees. Was pretty rude and even if something was wrong that's not right. The employee handled it very well but nobody deserves to be treated like trash!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

Currently getting my oil changed. I’m not one to typically write reviews, but I’ve had an awesome experience today. Tony was the man that greeted me and was professional in every aspect of service. He wasn’t pushy with up-selling and was very courteous. Thank you Tony! Give this guy a raise ;)< /Review>

Top notch service, great prices, free car wash, this should be everyone’s go to for an oil change. The team is not on commission so they recommend products for the well being of your car, but no pressure to buy. Quick, transparent, high quality, never thought I’d be SO HAPPY after a simple oil change. Gabriel will treat you right.

Also just drive up, 5min wait. Other shops said I’d need to book a time a week in advance for the service on a Saturday. Oilstop let’s you know they want your business and they prove it again each time.<//Review>

Fast service, polite but very pushy salespeople. I thought I'd be able to sit in my car and check email, catch up on phone calls etc. But every 15 seconds some other guy would appear at my window and yell over the sound of impact wrenches if I wanted to buy this or that service. I was trying to do a business deal with the windows up and they kept bothering me. Ideally this would be a great service -- pull in, tell them what you want, and have a few minutes to yourself in your car. But they ruin it with the nonstop sales tactics. Probably won't go back. Actually I'm sure I won't. It's still better than going to the dealership (horrible experience) but there are much better drive thru oil change services in the area that are less salesy.< /Review>

Prices are reasonable. Service is top notch, they ask you when you pull in if you want a drink which I usually ask for a bottle of water. They do ask several times if you want some extra oil preserver or new filters which I politely decline and that's the end of it. I make an effort to go during off peak hours so I'm usually in and out within a half hour which is what I expect for a simple oil change. Overall my favorite oil change place.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808f9ef7f4333e35:0xcb259c280f625ad8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Cost
Price is fair for the attention and quality.

Caveat
Only negative is they pitch a lot of additional services, so if you're bad at saying no, maybe go elsewhere. But upsells are not pressured and generally good advice. Regardless, their quality of service is worth overlooking this.

Time
Got there at 9:20am Monday, took about 50 mins with two cars ahead of me in my lane. Don't have to get out of the car so if you keep busy in your seat, doesn't feel long.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
It was my first time going here today for an oil change. Everyone was very friendly and I was immediately greeted and told there was going to be a 45 minute to an hour wait (it ended up being much less than that). Was given free water and coffee, which actually wasn't half bad. During the service they did try to upsell products but it's a business so I understand. Just politely decline and move on. If you let them know you had your fluids serviced at another shop recently they can code that into the system. With the 10 dollar yelp coupon my total came out to $45.68 after tax and waste disposal fee ($3.00). Very reasonable price considering if I were to buy everything myself it would come out to $35 to $40 not including the time it would take me to do it and the fact that I would have to deal with disposing the old oil. Thanks to Jovonne, Victor, and Franklin for the pleasant experience. I'll definitely be recommending this place.< /Review>

Been coming here for years and their service has always been professional and courteous.  No hard sales tactics and respectful when I politely decline their extra service offers.  They always provide a cold beverage while waiting and there's a free car wash voucher in Foster City with the receipt.  Basic oil change includes checking and topping off all fluids, tire pressure, door hinges and locks lubed and windows cleaned.  Price is reasonable.<//review>

This place is great! They get it done quickly and their prices are fair. It's a very pleasant experience and the customer service may be the best I've ever seen! Everyone who works there is enthusiastic, nice, and easy to talk to. Not to mention the complimentary beverages provided. You really can't get a better run business than this.<//review>

This place used to be a 5 star shop.  But the last 2 times I've used them it seems that the wheels are coming of of the place.  Gone is the organization.  Gone is the pride in workmanship.  Gone is well maintained and clean shop that I knew and loved.  It totally feels like the place is under new management and the new owners kind of suck.  A real shame. :(</Review>

This is a great place they service your vehicle great! They were friendly very informative and also threw out recommendations for your vehicle. The only con about this place is that they didn’t ensure to check the hoses within the areas serviced. I went there a week ago, the day before taking a long trip to Los Angeles only to smell burning chemicals coming from my engine finding out that the hose was disconnected from its allocated area. I knew it was because they checked my filter next to that hose that caused that to disconnect. Wish they were more attentive to the hoses. They also didn’t fill my windshield wiper fluid. Other than that great staff and very time managed!<//text>

Who has time to leave their car for service especially if you have little children? This place gives basic car service beyond just oil changes without leaving your car. Super nice respectful people. Probably more expensive than other oil change place, but worth it. I have been going here for years.< /Text>

The place rocks. Free drink while you wait. Super polite and they actually listen and stop the upselling if you tell them at the beginning I only want an oil change. I like that. Other oil stops they push bnb product on you every other minute which is annoying. The guys are friendly and have never screwed up a service for me. I hate that my vehicle is too big to use the free car wash coupon they give you but that's not their fault.</review>

Employees here are professional, and do a thorough job servicing your vehicle (which you can sit in your car for the duration of). While they are mostly friendly, any conversation sounds scripted and you will be asked for approximately 10 other service add-ons. It isn't terrible, as there is no pressure to buy anything, but it can get tedious and adds wait time. Prices normally run about $50 when its all said and done, but that includes a whole bunch of extras.Overall, Oilstop is a good and convenient option for oil changes.< /Text>

Don't forget to use the five dollar off coupon from their website. Cheaper than jiffy lube down the street and the workers care and know what they are doing.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>So far so good. Wasn't really pushy with the recommendations when all I wanted was an oil change. Prices are reasonable for what you get. Topped off all my fluids for free. I felt bad because I only came with a certain amount of cash and this place fit my budget. I had $60 on me and I forgot to ask if I can use a $5 off coupon. He knew I was hesitant with all the questions and recommendations but said it's ok if I say no and that he's used to it. I told him I wanted to donate and take the recommendations but I only had $60 and the basic oil change (with taxes) was $51.22. After everything he came back and told me my total and was surprised that he gave me a discount and only paid $48 and I had some change left over which made me happy. Jose Velazquez, David Anguiano, and Josie Panameno did a great job and treated me like a king lol I definitely recommend this place and I'll definitely keep coming back!!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

One thing I would say is they will try to upsell you at every chance but that's standard for basic car maintenance outfits such as this. I like the 33 point base package that includes small things such as door hinge lube. And by the way-free sodas, coffee, or water while you wait ( in your car). And they always show you the new parts and drain plug before, and the old parts and fluid after-major points for this.</text>< Pics>

<name>kamiyaia nili<//name><Review>It comes with a sunny side up egg and some sliced green onions. The portion size was a good amount for one person. I like that their menu has a good variety to choose from. The place is clean, the staff is nice, it was warm inside the restaurant though. I did get lost looking for this place, it's in a business building next to a Nexem staffing agency.< /Review><Response>None</Response>< user>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I really like this place; the menu exactly hits the spot for anyone looking for a great lunch spot with modest prices and has a variety of flavor palettes.

In one meal I had an Italian item and an Asian item; both were executed flavorfully (not bland) and thoughtfully (the flavors were exciting and authentic).

Not only that, but there are many different platforms for the flavors, whether by bowl, bun, wrap, or noodle.

Importantly, the portion sizes were satisfying!

Finally customer service and speed is good. I don't know if it's their preferred method, but if you're not able to call, they also take orders by email. Useful for detailed orders or during a work meeting!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Another great surprise as everything I tried was fantastic. Sandwhiches, comfort food, and the Korean food are all tasty. Service is okay and it can feel a little cramped.

So glad I found this place! Selection of sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and plates. They also have breakfast, smoothies, and healthy options. Came for lunch and ordered the Korean BBQ beef plate. Food was cooked to order and came out quick. Love the Asian fusion of the dishes. Amazing! I will be back.<//text>

<username>Tommy Pina< /username><Pics>None</Pics><review>There were a couple tables outside with people eating their lunch.  The inside had quite a few tables and almost all of them were occupied.  I intended to try the Korean BBQ Sandwich when I walked up to the counter, but after looking at the menu, I ordered the Fresco sandwich and an order of small fries well done, not limp.  It took about 10 minutes for my order number to be called.  The cashier asked me if I wanted any ketchup packages and I declined but asked if he had any ranch dressing.< /review>< gmap_id>

I found this nice little hidden gem/ golden nugget of a place very close to my work location and their menu items are phenomenal!! They open at 7:30am every weekday and they have an awesome selection of food items to choose from: Omelettes, bagels, sandwiches, burgers, wraps, bowls, salads, soups, teriyaki chicken or beef plates, fried rice plates, smoothies and even includes healthy food options, and/or vegetarian options. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Ontario area or even just passing by!!< /text>

Hands down the best food in Ontario. I used to work in the area from 2014 to 2016 tried everything around here. The wait can be long during the busy lunch hour, but it is worth waiting for (or taking your lunch a little later to avoid the crowd). I came back to try it out today (August 2018) and everything was just as good as I remembered. Same friendly owner and same great food. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in town.< /review>

Lunch special at 8.99 and dinner special at 12.99!

Food is good, simple!  It's local to me so I will often take advantage of the specials!  Very friendly staff also!< /review>

The food is great and made when ordered; the place is kind of small but the hospitality of the owner outweighs the size of the place... It does get busy during typical lunch hours so make sure to order ahead if you have limited time. I've tried their grilled chicken salad; teriyaki bowl and sandwiches & they're all equally great.<//review>

The Yakisoba (if you're not familiar with the dish) is chow mein, diced cabbage, and grilled chicken. It is served by itself. Delicious with their branded hot-sauce.As for the spicy pork plate, it is served over white steamed rice, along with a slice of watermelon. The pork is very tender, spicy and minimal diced onion</review>

<review>My friend and I drive a truck for a living. This little darling is .5 miles from a truck stop and worth every step to get there. We visited a few months ago and fell in love with it at first bite! They are only open weekdays and we had to wait to be here on a weekday to indulge again. The man (owner?) remembered us! We will go back every chance we get<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>The service is nice, the food is spicy depending on what you order. Accommodation with tables and chair were standard, not too large an area. Location is in a mall and is good for quick lunch, dinner etc. Will surely go back when I am shopping at that mall again. The food. Has a nice aromatic smell.</review>< rate>

<text>I'm a pretty picky eater, there are a lot of things I don't like so I am used to picking things out and making piles. LOL So I was so excited to find this place where the dish I ordered had nothing but fresh yummy stuff, no piles! I had the Vegtable Bowel with no chicken. It had bean sprouts, cabbage, carrots , onions and zucchini on a bed of rice. Perfectly seasoned, still crunchy, very fresh and yummy. They have lots of options for vegetarians which was great because those places are sometimes hard to find. They serve their meals in REAL dishes! I would highly recommend checking this place out. It is small so be prepared to wait a bit, but it is so worth it!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

My brother and sister kept repeating how good their food was over & over as they were eating! I agreed! I got the natural and added mushrooms. It was great! I would have added their thinly sliced onion, had I thought of it. My sister got chicken cashew and my brother got spicey Korean pork sandwich.</text>

The food, the service, the setting were a '10'. We were celebrating a special birthday with family and it was an excellent choice for the occasion. I highly recommend this restaurant for a fine dining experience.< /Review>

Flavor of the seasoned meat was excellent and bread was toasted perfectly. However, the cheese doesn't work with this sandwich as it trys to rake over instead of complimenting.  The place is clean and its nestled in an industrial park.< /Review>

Great food here! Was suprised at the variety of food options. Went with the loco moco, korean bbq fries, and the kimchi fried rice. All of them were fantastic with a very authentic flavor! The place was busy but the staff worked very efficient and fast to get the orders in and out to keep the line moving. Great experience!<//review>

This used to be the finest restaurant in the area. We went back recently for a happy hour and was disappointed in the food quality. My calamari was cold and my wife's prime rib was the opposite of tender.< /review>

My favourite smoke shop hands down in Sacramento. Employees know everything to talking about and will spend hours helping you if you need it. I've spent over $10000 there not don't regret one bit. They have the best products from top to bottom< /Review>

If you guys have been purchasing your supplies from anywhere else in town you are doing it wrong Tony and the rest of the staff here are excellent laid back and just downright cool. I have never received false information and they have always taken care of me no other Vape shop even compares<//Text>

Place is very chill and located very close to my house so I tend to go here for my alternative needs.

There are tons of CBD products ranging from edibles that look like buds but are made of chocolate all the way to a wide selection of paraphernalia.

I tend to go here more so for the CBD cigarettes because I have quit smoking tobacco.
The staff is super friendly and informative and the atmosphere is quiet as well as there is a bunch to look at so save some time for this place.

I've been here multiple times so it's a testament that they satisfy me enough to come back again and again<//text>

Excellent selection of various vaping and smoking products.  Looking to quit smoking so I went in for a vaporizer.  The staff was great at explaining all the differences in the many vaping options.  I left completely satisfied with my experience.<//review>

I've been in this place a few times asking about different things here and there (pipes, vape juice  papers, ect) and everything I've seemed to get the same tall guy with glasses redish hair beard and beanie and he's not even remotely helpful when I ask recommendations he said "that's like asking your favorite soda" then he said "if you ask me personally im too old for that sh*t" how about some customer service?? Rest staff seem okay but I wont be coming back and will be sharing my story.< /review>

I bought a tank from them awhile back. The glass broke so I went back to see if they have replacement glass. They didn't. Why sell a tank that you don't have the pieces to replace? Seems dumb to me.</Review>

I stopped to see if they had a product I was looking for which they did they definitely have a lot of products but the staff on the other hand very rude and short tryed to make friendly conversation and considering that was buying a $100 worth of product they were total f'in douchebags for whatever reason Im not the type of customer they want their store I guess..... I was planning picking up a couple of other little things that I had some questions about but considering they pretty much were trying to push me out of their store so they can continue whatever their conversation that I apparently interrupted that must have been way more important than making a couple hundred bucks from now on I'll take my business the alien Vape over in antelope instead<//Text>

Don't buy from there unless you already know how to use the product. Great for a re up trash for new discoveries.<//text>

Great vape spot. I usually order most my coils and parts online, but if I'm in a pinch they always have what I need in stock. Also picked up this new Krave strain Trainwreck,  I haven't seen it at any other smoke or vape shops. Highly recommend it if you're into kratom.< /Review>

Not a lot of space to social distance. Some products do not have expiration dates. Had rancid product, returned without receipt for store credit so that was good business but they should double check quality.<//Text>

< Review>
Went in as an inexperienced vape buyer expecting help, and was met with arrogance and a bad attitude after explaining what flavor we were browsing for we were id’ed by the shaved headed employee who has a red beard and wears glasses named David (i will not be going back based on this individuals attitude) after scoffing at my age on the id its and old id we were greeted with more attitude and belittling remarks after stating clearly we do not know much about vape juices. Overall i would give the experience a zero out of 5 its disappointing to see old employees let new treat customers this way. I honestly hope the company will get back to me and let us know this individual was disciplined/ talked to about his unprofessional behavior.< /Review>

Way overpriced and not impressed. My wife and I were interested in picking up some juice and vape supplies and the guy that we approached for assistance was not helpful and seemed disinterested in helping us. I will not be back. There are several better places in the area.< /review>

Fast and friendly service. A 500 gram bag of kratom for $100, that's a good deal. Compared to $29.99 or more for ~100 grams elsewhere.</text>

I have been to this place twice and BOTH times these guys acted as if they were much better than me &I was such an inconvenience to help then LITERALLY TOLD ME TO GO TO A DIFFERENT VAPE STORE when I had a couple questions . I’ve never been treated so horrible. Since then a couple of my friends told me they wouldn’t refund defective items bought with their receipt in hand & that most of their items are off brand &still over priced. Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time/money</Text>< GmapID>

The staff here was absolutely amazing.  They listened to what I wanted and steered me I the right direction. I love the vape setup he sold me. After I left I accidentally left my wallet on the bus stop outside. The gentlemen at the shop saw it and picked it up for me and kept it safe until I came back a few hours later.</Review>

< Review>
Poor customer service.  The guy that was helping us had an attitude when I was asking him questions. You would think for a business that had just opened and has a ton of competition would be friendly and helpful so they could build a solid foundation of return customers. I will never shop there again. First impressions are everything.</Review>

Good selection for the most part.  Especially if youre after anything E-Cig.  Everything is overpriced by quite a bit.  Staff is helpful and friendly.  This is bar far the largest smoke shop Ive ever been in, and I've been to a few...  If you can get passed the fact that they are overpriced, I can go ahead and recommend a visit...</Review>

Edit review.Your E juices are good, but you need to get Black Note a E juice. it will make you so much money it is made out of real tobacco, and is not cheap, Comes from Italy, & it is made for the middle & high class, Plus it is the #1 Tobacco e juice company in the entire world. Second you need a Website, or at least make some pictures on Facebook with a list of all the juices you have.</text>

Decent selection of oils.  The person who helped me was not very friendly and didnt seem very knowledgeable about the different vaporizers.  Either that or they just didnt doing their job.< /Review>

<review>Has a lot of selection, but they were very rude! I had two questions about a vape flavor that comes in two different brands and the man acted like it was the biggest inconvenience to have to help me! Their prices are rather high, but with the only place that carries some of the flavors I guess that's why they do that. I will never go back though, customer service is everything and when you won't answer questions, ignore customers, and try to rush people to just pick something and get out, I will take my business somewhere else.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x809adedf3a7e1a23:0x85ff17d43074a12c</Gmap_id></record>

Went back ready to fight to get my $168.00 back. Met some resistance at first from "Joe", until he understood me and offered me a far better PAX 2 and could not have been nicer. It was my attitude at first that was wrong. He made thing right. Excellent customer service. Atta Boy, Joe! Thanks for keeping calm in spite of my being confrontational.</Text>< Pics>

I asked if I could do a return or exchange the next day and was refused. They wouldnt do an even exchange because my batteries were now used.

I have visited this place many times and the best thing about this place is that they have new, different merchandise to choose from EVERY SINGLE TIME I've been in there and I go every couple days. I'ts unbelievable! The variety is Awesome as well! I've been to many shops like this but never so many NEW goodies to buy every time! The staff is really helpful as well . Alot of customers are there all the time but luckily they have 4 or 5 people working there so your in and out pretty fast. They are knowledgable as well so feel free to ask a question or two they are down to earth and friendly. Damn... I should be getting paid for this review. Geez... I act like I have stock in the company or something. Lol!< /Review>

Got a great deal on a Nitecore battery charger, best price in town (I legitimately checked/called every vape shop and electronics store from downtown to Roseville) but noticed certain items were overpriced though. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Big selection of hardware. I can't comment on the liquid selection or prices because I wasn't looking for that on my visit to this shop. Parking lot is awful but that's not the fault of the business. In all, not a bad place to go for vape supplies, just have an idea of average prices before you buy.<//Review>

The staff was awesome. As I am new to vaping they help me with the right pen and a really good chocolate e liqid. They taught me how to inhale with the vape. I have never smoked but used snuff and went through a can and a half. I bought the Aspire K4 and love it.. This will be my vape shop from now on. My goal is to quit the skoal completely.</review>

Went there a few months ago and purchased a yocan evolve plus... Approximately three weeks later it won't charge anymore. I called and talked to a gentleman who informed me that I need to contact yocan for a replacement... Contacted yocan and was told the store front is responsible for it.... So I'd say the lack of accountability for the products they sell is dissapppinting. Just make sure you get something that won't break otherwise you will have wasted money like me. Thanks for nothing!</Text>

I have been very disappointed at this store. I have arrived here at 9:30 multiple times and they have not opened yet. If you place a open time and you haven't opened yet on a constant basis just change your opening time to one you can do.</review>

<text>I absolutely LOVE Dr. Redkar!  I'm absolutely crushed that she's moving to my hometown, but wish her all the best in that beautiful city.  She's caring, knowledgeable, skilled, and has collected an amazing team to support her!   She explained my injury (partial Achilles tear) and the repair/surgery process.  Surgery was a breeze, and I was made aware of the long recovery & therapy processes.</text><date>1620323235012<//date></record>

Dr. Briskin and his team were ultra professional in every way, and I am very happy with my result. I was out of my boot cast a week early and able to do a three mile walk within 7 weeks.  I am amazed at how well the operation went and it was a lot less painful that I anticipated. His team was courteous and patient.  Dr. Briskin gave me great advice that was easy to understand, and took time to answer every question.  I would very highly recommend him and his team to anyone contemplating foot surgery.< /Review>

<review>Very Money Hungry Clinique!!! Only wants money from you!!!
Send me invoice already before first visit.
Could not see Doctor before  paying first.
I have full insurance 100% but still wanted me to pay first before seeing the Doctor even without knowing what he was going to do.
I had to wait 1.28 hours to see anyone.
DO NOT GO HERE!!!  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1620762513476, 'text': 'Dear Edwin,\n\nWe were so sorry to read your review. I hope this explanation sheds light on what happened.\n\nOur policy is to verify insurance information prior to the appointment so everything is in order when the patient comes in.  When you booked the appointment, we told you that we needed insurance information, but we did not receive it until you came in for the appointment.  Because it takes time to verify insurance, we advised you that we need a credit card on file (since this would be essentially an appointment without insurance) or you could wait until the insurance was verified.\n\nBy the time you filled out the paperwork, your benefits info was obtained. While you do have insurance, unfortunately, we are out of-network with your plan. At that point, you decided to leave. You wanted a refund,  but we told you nothing was ever charged to your credit card.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or there’s anything we can do to help.\n\nWe wish you all the best.'}<//Resp>

If you are lucky enough to have Dr. Redkar taking care of your feet problems, you can count your blessings. She knows her job and she knows your feet and she knows how to treat whatever problem you might encounter. She cares about what she is doing. She cares about her patients, and she guides us to a better life with better stability in our feet. Count yourself lucky if you have a visit to Dr. Redkar to have her take care of your cares.< /text>

I was able to see my primary care provider the next morning. X-rays confirmed the break. My doctor referred me to a podiatrist in Santa Monica. Turns out they are closed until Jan. 4th. Cinda, Dr. LaBrot’s receptionist gave me her podiatrist name, followed by a glowing recommendation. I called Dr. Briskin at his Santa Monica office. Can you be here in 45 minutes was the receptionists response? Everything about the experience was first class, the lovely office, the receptionist, the nurse and of course Dr. Briskin. I write reviews only when I am overwhelming happy with an experience. This was one of those times.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>102364546786148687030<//user><GmapID>0x80c2bb4bea783989:0xa509ea6977634347<//GmapID>< Time>

Such a great practice. I have had nothing but amazing visits with Doctor Bob and the staff. Dr. Bob has such a great personality,  so positive and helps you understand all that is going on. His confidence and knowledge puts you at ease. Gina is awesome and has been very attentive to my needs both pre surgery & after sugery. Gina has a great future in the field because personality makes all the difference with patients. Cheli is amazing and on top of every piece of paperwork and email, she is 1 in a million... The staff is on top of it, I think the longest wait I've had is 10 min. A fantastic overall experience at University Foot & Ankle Institue of Santa Monica.<//text>

<text>We Fedexed discs with my MRI's to the correct address, and they were signed for but no one could locate them, so we had to spend another $50 to Fedex them again. When we drove from Sedona, AZ to LA to meet with Dr. Baravarian, both sets of CD's were there.

Dr. Baravarian did not do a thorough exam. We felt he was quite dismissive and wanted to very quickly pass the problem off to Mayo Clinic. Even now, we are not sure if he felt my foot pain has any physical issue that needs addressing in addition to the root case of my other symptoms. He said we would be given his email address as we left (on his card) but after we left, we realized we were not given the card.

After the reviews we had read online and his writings on tendon issues, we were really disappointed by our visit.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1604951933287, 'text': 'Dear Becca,\n\nThank you for your review and we are sorry about the issue with the MRI CD’s. That was clearly an unfortunate internal issue.\n\nTo be clear, I reviewed your films for close to an hour before you arrived. I completely understood you were coming to me about your peroneal tendon. But after reviewing your films, it was clear that you had multiple serious issues that would require a team approach (multiple doctors, each with their own specialty) to address your case properly and successfully. Anything less than that would be wrong.\n\nSo I highly recommended you go to Mayo as they are best equipped to deal with your situation. I did not mean to be dismissive, but instead cut to the chase as your situation was out of the purview of my practice and profession.  Unfortunately, there was simply not more I could do.\n\nI will have my assistant look up your email address and send you my contact information. You should have gotten my card before you left, so we will rectify that situation ASAP.\n\nI do hope you will follow my suggestion and I hope you will let me know what they say.\n\nPlease take good care of yourself.\n\nBob Baravarian'}<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2bb4bea783989:0xa509ea6977634347</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend coming here if you have any kind of ankle or foot fracture. They're very knowledgeable and very polite. Everything is under one roof, if you suspect a fracture just come here first before going to the ER or urgent care. I almost had to get an MRI pay a lot of money. Dr bob told me it wasn't neccessary. The reason I'm deducting a star is because the parking, they don't validate. The receptionist, doesn't smile and just has a face of disappointment on her. They need someone a little more welcoming in the office for such a great place like this.</Review>

Dr. Baravarian was extremely professional, helpful, and compassionate. I had moderate to severe pain in both feet with walking and standing for years that went misdiagnosed by a number of board certified podiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and general practitioners. Even after seeing the so-called "best foot doctors" in 3 different major cities in the Southeast, I was told by all that I needed irreversible surgery or a potentially damaging procedure done. Doctor Baravarian not only worked with me from across the country during consultations to help get me on the right track, but also challenged the conclusions of the other doctors and through suggesting MRI's was able to uncover my actual diagnosis via imaging. My progress in recovery with the correct treatment with the right diagnosis skyrocketed after being stagnant for almost 5 years.! As a young, active individual, it was like I got my life back. I highly recommend anyone, whether in the local area, across the country, or anywhere in the world who is not happy with the results they are getting from their doctor treating their foot or ankle condition, or anyone who feels like they are stuck at a dead end and told that surgery is the only option for them, to call Dr. Baravarian and get a second opinion. It was well worth my time and money many times over, and I all but guarantee it will be worth yours too.<//text>

Without hesitation, I can honestly say, Dr. Saeedi provides the best doctor- patient care I have ever experienced. I feel as though I am being greeted by an old friend every time I walk in, starting with the front desk to Dr. Saeedi, himself, who really goes above and beyond to make me feel comfortable, welcome, and fixes my issues with great follow up suggestions to always improve. He treats each patient with the utmost care, patience, and professionalism, I have seen this firsthand with how he handles others.

I would highly recommend 10/10.</text><Resp>{'time': 1593415254992, 'text': 'Dr. S and the UFAI staff take great pride in treating patients as they would like to be treated. Thanks for your kind remarks ;)'}<//Resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Kevin Bernstein< /name></record>

<review>Dr Saeedie on my appts was excellent at his high level medical skill set and he has the best patient compassion and follow up patient care I have ever experience, UFAI is very lucky!! to have him on staff as a Doctor!! I would highly recommend Dr Saeedie to anyone in need of a foot Doctor specialist and make a appt at UFAI today for the best care!<//review>< pics>

<text>Great office staff, entire group was awesome. My only complaint was near the end of my time there, Dr B mentioned I should go to another clinic due to the severity of my right foot. It was broken, swolken and in major pain and I left embarrassed w the grpupnand was just left waiting a whole month to get into USC. I felt thete was a more helpful way to get me better help then to cut me off hanging..
All in all, the group is great and I would recommend....</text>< pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Unfortunate to have to leave this review. I went here for months and saw Dr. Bob Bavarian. When I asked for a copy of my records and went to get a 2nd opinion from another doctor they charged my credit card again ($80 co-pay) when I had already paid my co-pay on the last appointment, which was about 2 months earlier! I called the billing department 3 times and no one ever got back to me. Please double check your credit card bill carefully, as they seem to be making (what is hopefully) errors.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I've been here twice, both for nail issues on my big toe. Nothing complicated, but painful enough, and I didn't want to trust some random pedicurist for the job. The doctor identified and solved the nail issue both times. It was slightly painful having him dig around my toenail, but it was exactly what was needed, and I felt great immediately and walked out feeling terrific with zero pain. I had very little wait time to see the doctor, though 2 different junior doctors did examine me first and try to figure out the problem, but it wasn't until the senior doctor came in and he immediately was able to work with me to figure out the problem and fix it.</Text>< userid>

I can't recommend Dr. Briskin and the entire University Foot and Ankle staff highly enough.   I've been seeing doctor briskin for a couple of years now, and it's always been a positive experience.   From the ease and flexibility of making an appointment, to the friendly front desk staff and PA's,  and Dr. Briskin's friendly nature and professionalism; you just can't go wrong in choosing University Foot and Ankle.   I've also gone to their physical therapists across the hall and again, couldn't have been happier with all of the staff and my results.  I would give them all more than 5 stars if it were possible.<//Review>

The care Dr Baravarian and his team provided me was simply the best. His diagnosis, surgery and follow up have resulted in my feeling better and being able to be more active than I have been in 7 years. I can't thank them enough.< /Text>

My initial appointment was with Dr Redkar and recent appointments with Kevin for my orthotics. Dr. Redkar has an awful "bedside manner". She is very curt and didn't give a thorough exam for my orthotics I felt like she must've had more important things to do than to help me. Her receptionist is very unprofessional and tried to bill me for a return visit when I came to the office because my orthotics were incorrect. Kevin was 1.5 half hours late for my first appointment with him. On what was to be my 2nd visit to pick up my new orthotics, he called an hour before my appointment to tell me that he "forgot" my new orthotics in his other office and would need to reschedule. All in all it took me more than 2 months to receive my (much needed) orthotics. Your business is highly unprofessional I have called my insurance carrier to express my grievances with your practice.< /review>

<Review>I am very happy with the care.  All but one front desk staff are helpful.  The xray and CT technicians are great with great patient interaction.  Dr Baravarian is extremely patient and explains everything i ask to be explained. There are some issues with one front desk lady that requires extra diligence of patients, but i go there for excellent medical treatment, and it is well provided. One grumpy employee isn't much setback. I highly recommend UFAI.<//Review><Name>Puh Chooly<//Name><Resp>{'time': 1560806064009, 'text': 'Thanks for you recommendation and honest evaluation.

<text>This is the worst service and experience I have ever had with a doctor's office. Upon making my appointment, I was told that I would pay a $15 co-pay and that would be all. After arriving for my appointment (went to the wrong location also because there was NO addresss of where I should go for my appointment) I was told I had no co-pay. I ended up having to pay $156.00 for a 10 minute doctor's visit where I could of gotten this same info over Web MD. Not helpful AT ALL. After paying my $156.00 I asked for them to send me an itemized receipt from my visit to explain why I had to pay $156.00 for this bogus check-up. I still have NOT received my itemized receipt after calling 4 different times, leaving voicemails and speaking with several different people (one being a lady named Candy). The service here is truly terrible and I had to pay a ridiculous amount of money after being told I just had a $15 co-pay since I was 100% covered with my insurance. I will never go back here again and will make sure to tell everyone I know to never go here also. As a recommendation, when a customer calls several times to try to get a simple itemized receipt and is having this information withheld from them, think about the repercussions that this would have on your business. It's horrible customer service and it's shameful. Do not go here!<//text><name>Emyly Hall< /name><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1520363495495, 'text': "Hi Emyly,\n\nI apologize for the delay in getting your itemized receipt and I hope the following can shed some light on the insurance and co-pay issue.\n\nMedical insurance and billing, is a pain for everyone. Here are three important things you need to know:\n\n1. It’s important to know that we always process an insurance benefit check prior to patients coming in or sometimes when they arrive if we do not have their insurance information ahead of time. We discuss their insurance deductible and costs with them and never order anything or charge anything unless it is authorized by the patient.\n\n2. We collect an amount that we are told, to the penny, by each patient's insurance company. This is usually calculated by them based on how much has been credited to their annual deductible plus the terms of their individual insurance plan. That number is usually right, but not always, depending on when other bills come in before ours to the insurance company.  But if there are any discrepancies we always refund the difference.\n\n3. We do not bill insurance companies and collect the balance later from patients due to the proliferation of high deductible plans and to avoid having to chase patients down for payment thus we try hard to be totally upfront about costs so they do not get a surprise bill.\n\nIf you still need a copy of your receipt or have any other questions, please feel free to contact me at webhelp@footankleinstitute.com\n\nLastly, in regard to the “10-minute appointment,” our doctors spend the amount of time needed with each individual patient. In your case, it is very possible that your issues were easy enough that only 10 minutes was needed.  Simpler cases result in shorter appointments while more complex cases require more time.\n\nYes, some answers may be found on WebMD as sometimes things are easy. But if it was a more serious issue than you thought it was, you would have been darn happy to have learned about it. And that is why most people go to the doctor, to be sure they are okay.\n\nBest,\n\nDr. Baravarian"}<//Resp></record>

Dr. Baravarian is simply a miracle worker! The prognosis last year was 50% that our 90 yo father would lose his lower limb at Kaiser's Wound Care Clinic. Under Dr. Baravarian's skilled, exceptional care, Dad's been standing for ever longer periods each day and beginning to take steps again in the last 3 months. Have been asked for the name of the miracle worker several times now. Never pass up the opportunity to pass along how terrific Dr. Baravarian and everyone at the UFAI has been from Day 1. Thanks are rather inadequate. Larry Feinstein, PhD< /Review>

I have horrible feet. Bad DNA. My aunt and my mother have both had multiple surgeries. I had hallux rigidis in both feet and neuromas in both feet.

I met with surgeons at Cedars, Kerlan Jobe, UCLA, DISC, and other places. Then I asked my primary care physician (with St. John's which has Santa Monica Orthopedic Group / SMOG) who he would pick and he said his daughter is having bunion surgery and he is going to Dr. Baravarian. My brother in law and a high school friend who are both orthopedic surgeons most-agreed with Dr. Baravarian's diagnosis and treatment advice. It is a luxury in LA to have many good surgeons to choose from but I have now had three surgeries with Dr. Baravarian and am 100% happy I chose to go with University Foot and Ankle.

Quick rundown:
Playing sports means more to me than almost anything.
I am in the gym playing basketball, out playing tennis, skiing, running with my dog, or at least lifting weights 6-7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. I'm 6'3" and 200lbs so I am tough on my feet. When I play basketball I play in a game with a number of people who used to play professionally in Europe and the NBA. It is a high level game and it was very important to me that after foot surgery I wasn't just going to be "walking pain free" again but playing at the highest level I could.

Neuromas in both feet were handled wonderfully. I was suffering from a lot of irritation. The bottoms of my feet had pockets of fluid where my body was trying to protect myself from the rubbing on the nerve and anything athletic was painful. The feet were swollen slightly afterwards but I basically was walking right away. Over time the feet were a bit sore and it took a little while to heal but after a few months I could not tell the surgeries were ever done. Perfect.

In my left foot I had a cheilectomy for the hallux rigidis. 6 years after the surgery it feels great. One day I may need to go to a full fusion here but not yet. The cheilectomy felt easy. It was a while ago but I think I was walking that day. It healed great.

In my right foot I had a cheilectomy done knowing that eventually I might have to have a full fusion because that foot was in much worse shape than my left foot. 6 years later I had the fusion done (March of 2018). By the end of June I was playing tennis again, playing basketball, running and squatting in the gym. I can explode off my right foot (my plant foot) and get above the rim in basketball with ZERO felt difference between my toe pre and post-fusion. Actually post-fusion it only feels better because it is pain free (and range of motion is indistinguishable).

If I had any regret at all it is that I didn't get both toes fused just because the fusion went SO WELL on the right foot that why not take the risk of ever having to get the left foot cheilectomy redone off the table for the rest of my life?

So that is it - I have had numerous surgeries with Dr. Baravarian. He consistently recommended a thoughtful and conservative treatment approach, every single surgery has led to a great outcome I am very happy with, his office is always accommodating if I need to get in for something small like a new pair of orthotics or something more important like seeing Dr. Baravarian about new foot pain. As a surgeon, Dr. Baravarian listened to my athletic goals and customized the plate that fixed my fusion in place. Also Dr. Baravarian listened to my reasonable concerns about wanting to travel for work and not wanting to be in a cast for 3 straight months, switching me to a boot after a reasonable period of time. This let me start walking earlier, didn't atrophy my muscles as much, was able to stay more connected at work and was psychologically relieving. Other surgeons were more conservative about keeping you in a cast forever. I appreciate a surgeon who is willing to listen to the patient and be reasonable and thoughtful based on the individual.

10 stars.< /text>

I was traveling recently and injured my foot. Based on the recommendation of a friend (and after reading all the great reviews), I decided to give University Foot & Ankle Institute a try. Considering the circumstances, the whole ordeal was pretty painless!  The wonderful staff at UFAI was able to get me in to see Dr. Baravarain quickly and efficiently, they even took my insurance! After a visit with Dr. Bob, I was pain free and on my way in no time!  Thanks UFAI for taking such great care of me!< /Review>

<text>This is my second experience, first plantar fasciitis, now my Achilles, lucky me. :(

I would not go anywhere else and my feet are glad. Both times I have totally avoided surgery and for the Achilles, I was REALLY concerned that would be the case.

An amazing thing called PRP (don't ask me to spell what those letters mean), where they spin my own blood down an then re-inject it in the Achilles to tell the body to get its act together and heal the area, is amazing. And it's working, which is the most amazing thing of all.

I am thankful for UFAI and that I don't have to think about my Achilles pain anymore.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
I am an avid runner but had a foot injury that made even walking excruciatingly painful. I went to University Foot and Ankle Institute after being misdiagnosed by another doctor.  Everyone in the office is so nice, from office staff to the technicians. And Dr. Baravarian quickly diagnosed me with a bone spur and recommended orthotics. The orthotics have changed my life! Not only am I completely painfree and enjoying running again, i am training for my first marathon! Thank you Dr. Baravarian!<//Review>

I tried this spa courtesy of a friend.  I had Valentino for my masseuse- she is awesome! Very attentive,  thorough,  a terrific experience.  The reason for the loss of a star is the reception she is a touch curt and fails to make you feel important.  I'm sorry but it's a spa I should feel zen from the moment I walk in. I will be returning again as the lady who did my massage was fabulous and worth the price.<//text>

I called Thursday and booked an appointment for Saturday with no problem. I got the Rose Paradise Luxury Spa Package for Two. When we got there the wait time was short. Like 2 minutes after we finished the paper work. We got to the room and there were candles, rose pedals, sparking wine, fruit, and chocolate. The foot soak was nice with rose petals that smelled perfect. The robes were soft and the massage was relaxing. We plan on making this a monthly trip! The price was perfect for all that was set up.<//text>< Rate>

<Review>I called and made an appointment for me and my girlfriend. Something came up and I called and left a message to reschedule and instead of getting helped I was texted this message from the owner-

“Hi Dakota!! Thank you, you made a good joke. Never again reserve an apartment in my office.
Chakras day spa.”

Sorry I had to reschedule but there’s never a chance I’ll do that after you texting me this

***UPDATE*** she called me back and I asked if it was to apologize and she said, “no, you are the one who should apologize” what the hell is going on with this terrible customer service< /Review><user_id>114137659934098978394</user_id></record></dataset><record>

I had a 6pm Friday appointment. I leave early it's a Friday and I don't live in Roseville. As I'm pulling into the parking lot Marina calls me to tell me they have to cancel my appointment because she doesn't feel well. Marina then says I have high blood pressure and I'm not feeling good. Well so do I and diabetes n pulled muscles!!! So what. Never buy from this place!</text>

I would not recommend anyone to go to this business and spend their money, went in for massage made me wait close to an hour and customer service was terrible...but they still took my Groupon voucher and never gave me service...after my experience with this, I don't want to reschedule, let alone step foot in that place ever again...I should have called the police on them for taking my money and providing no service to me... which is stealing... which is a crime, so don't go there period.<//review>

<text>My gf and I went for our birthdays. What an awesome experience. Very nicely decorated. Very inviting. Loved the music they were playing. We were in the couples room. They had tea waiting for us and a bowl of sweets. We were given time to enjoy ourselves. No rush felt there. The message was amazing. Good pricing. Make sure you bring money this isn't a 50 dollar massage place.<//text>< pictures>

Do not go here , I went for a 60 minute massage and got a 30 minute massage.  When I asked why it was so short the lady shrugged her shoulders and stated it included dressing time . She didn't start my massage until 2:55 and it ended at 3:25. The worst place u could go .< /text>

<review>Horrible service. Would not recomend. I bought a groupon and called to make an appointment. After about the 7th time i tried to call, leaving many messages, i realized i wasn't going to be answered. I had to drive there to make an appointment. They only gave me 40 minute massage though my groupon was a 60 min. Everywhere was signs to tip generously because there is no discount on great service... i would have tipped generously had i gotten even satisfactory service let alone great service. Natasha would not listen to what i wanted out of my massage and focused on areas i did not want. I said legs she did arms. She was very short with me and i think she may have been sick. Sneezed and fought back coughs. Got interrupted to talk in hall, could hear people talking outside the room. I could go on but basically I Will not be going back.< /review>< pics>

I cannot find better words to say about this place. Their Rose Paradise package is absolutely amazing. Me and my friend had a fabulous experience having being massaged on the table covered with fresh rose petals and candle lights all around the room.  Great treatment. Recommend to everyone.<//text>

I’ve never in my life not had massage therapists not massage front of me when I turn over . She didn’t even massage my feet or hands really . That was not a $97 package.

< Review>
I purchased the Groupon for a trigger point massage and hand/foot exfoliation. I read the reviews before going in and was a bit nervous. Like every other business I think that they might have had some incompetent staff but the massage therapist who my appointment was with today was friendly and competent. He made sure to ask me if I was comfortable several times and he focused on the tension in my shoulders in a soothing and experienced way. The room was clean and the ambiance was able to help me clear my mind and relax. I could have paid an extra $25 for a deep tissue massage but I'm glad I stuck with something soothing light for my first visit. I will be returning here for my next self care day.< /Review>

I puchased a groupon and honestly wasn't expecting too much. I was extremely impressed and definitely want to return. Music in the waiting room wasn't very relaxing so I wasn't so sure at first. I have extreme knots and pain and was impressed with Anastasia's ability to be firm and do deep tissue yet combine it with a calming relaxing style.   The "trigger point" massage offered was not deep tissue. There is an extra charge for that. I will definitely return to see her again!< /Text>

< review>
I bought a Groupon for a massage and called several times to make an appointment, left messages and no one called me back. By the time I finally got an appointment my Groupon had expired, which I did mention on the phone. They charged me a $10 fee for using an expired Groupon, no mention of this while making my appt. When I questioned the fee the massage therapist was very rude and said she would charge me the whole $75 for the massage if I didn't want to pay the $10 expired Groupon fee. No where does their site or on Groupon did it say there was a fee. I explained to her how many times I called to set up an appt, I also emailed them and left messages. She told me that's not her problem my "Groupon is expired so I pay or go!" I was very unhappy with my massage, as the woman who just yelled at me was the massage therapist. How relaxing right?! About halfway through the massage she left the room, leaving the door open! Someone came in turned the light on then off and left as I am lying there naked on the table. Why did she even leave the room, she could have at least closed the door for my privacy. The whole experience is not something you should go through for a relaxing day and the massage wasn't anything special. Go somewhere else.</review>

So rude. The lady at the front desk was mean. Such a shame as I came here to be pampered as a present from my husband. Not to be rude too. Will not be coming here again. They also messed up my first appointment. So I had to come back.<//Review>

<Text>So I booked once and they made me book again (a month later) because they accidentally double booked. Then , when I went in for the appointment the esthetician said my appointment was in the "other book" which makes absolutely no sense . When I told her the name of the women who took my appointment down the receptionist had no idea who I was talking about which means the old receptionist didn't work there anymore and left on bad terms because what is she going to do with the book of the appointements?! So this means ALL OF THE APPOINTMENTS the other receptionist may have taken down(along with our information) must have been ignored or dissappeared into thin air along with the old receptionist. Not to mention both times I walked in for my appointment I had to wait 30 minutes+ to be tended to. The second (and last time) time the manager sat in the massage chair with a friend of hers yapping away while I waited 40 minutes plus to be helped by the esthetician who came out from an appointment with lotion still on her hands and the poor girl just looked at me waiting for me to explode but I just said okay and walked out. I bought my facial off of Groupon and if your thinking to do the same: DO NOT DO IT.</Text><username>Renée Corona</username><userid>101205229985102342416< /userid><Date>1515265500130< /Date></record>

This place is absolutely horrible. I have no idea how they stay on business. They are so rude and unprofessional. 2 of us tried calling on several occasions to schedule appointments and either got an answering machine and left messages that were never returned. Or actually spoke to someone and they said that they would call us back and never did. Do not buy a Groupon for this place because they will not honor it and Groupon will not give you a refund< /review>

Ugh. Bought a Groupon for a 60 minute facial and glove treatment. Got neither. The front desk staff were rude and brusque. Definitely not an atmosphere of calm and relaxation. Then, after getting on the bed and ready for the treatment, I got a 20 minute sales pitch where the therapist explained that the Groupon basically covered a fancy facial cleanse only and that I had to pay $35 or $62 for the full experience. By that point I just wanted to relax and enjoy and so I went with a $35 package (in addition to what I already paid for with the Groupon) and that included a glycolic peel. The therapist was older, with jerky hand motions that were not relaxing at all, she also had bad breath that I had to endure when she hovered over me. The warm towels she used to clean my face smelled musty and caused me to want to run home and take a shower to get the stale smell off me. After all the sales pitch the treatment itself probably only lasted 40 minutes and there was NO glove treatment. .< /Text>

Very bad experience, I had a peel facial with Homa and after few hours my skin was all red and burnt. I couldn't sleep and when I called them next day they informed me in a rude way that she was on contract and now on vacation for a week. My skin is very very bad after facial and I can leave my house for few days now. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone!!!</review>

I tried calling in June to make an appointment and got voicemail.  I left a message, no return.  I forgot about my Groupon until August.  I called again, same problem.  After reading the reviews of this place, it looks like I'll never get an appointment.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I spent $120 for a cut and I asked for baylage with a dark base and natural tones. I emphasized I wanted to keep my hair dark. I was assured it could be done but left with brassy orange high lights, a weird red orange base color & a front chunk that is a splotchy bleach streak called the "money piece". I did respectfully voice my disappointment about it, the owner said to come back in a week and she will fix it for free if I still didn't like it, which was nice. But my trust has already been broken for various reasons with the overall salon experience and outcome of my hair.
I will spend the money it takes to go to a trusted stylist to correct this.
The cut was good and maybe I would have had a better outcome if I just went for a solid color... that's why I asked first if they could do what I wanted.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1618693248641, 'text': "Clara im very disappointed with the  review you posted about my salon .I did offer to fix it at another time because it was very late already in the day .I asked if you were not happy we could  and go darker i don't know what else you want me to do the offer still stands .\nSincerely\nPIlar Chavez\nOwner of Pilars Golden Shears"}<//Resp><gmapID>0x809531955f082e5b:0x429d192178383e77< /gmapID></record>

I have been coming here for awhile now, and the last 2 visits were with Jennifer. Now, she has taken the time to talk about my hair with me. She has styled my hair to the point I've cried tears of joy when I seen it. She also does Eye Lash Extensions, which I'm looking into doing for the first time with her. My hair is extra thin, and she has a very wonderful way of making me feel beautiful 💙<//review>

Good hairstylist BUT I got my eyelashes extension done too. And not sure if it was the glue they used but my eyelashes only lasted a week n before the second week they were all almost gone. I paid $75 so def not worth getting ur eyelashes done here. And the lady that did mine was a lil rude too< /text>

<text>I purchased a groupon for my lashes. 53$ for a new set & a free lash fill. The lash glue was very weak and my lashes were bald within a week. And they charged me 25$ for a fill because they were almost bald. So my fill didn’t end up being free. It wasn’t my first time getting my lashes, I wanted to try out a new spot and never again will I go back to Pilar’s. The quality was very poor.< /text>< pics>

This place is terrible! I bought the groupon for eyelash extensions and when I tried to use it they gave me some B.S. excuse about them not accepting groupons on that day. There were no restrictions listed on the Groupon itself. I would never recommend them to anyone. They are frauds.</text>

< Review>
Was super excited to try the very hyped up Better Buzz Coffee soft serve and coffee! Walked up after coming from the beach around 4pm with a big smile on my face and was not greeted. The workers just stared at us. Mind you, we had about 8 people who were willing to spend their dollars here. They were out of soft serve! What?? You're open until 7pm and no soft serve? That's ridiculous. No "Hey I'm so sorry" or a "have a nice evening"... just a "I don't want to deal with you" type of attitude. Glad you guys care about your customers!!! Think I will stick to another local coffee joint from now on.</Review>

My place of peace is this coffee shop! I love to linger here and just let time pass while sitting on their cozy lounge and enjoying a nice cup of my favorite matcha after a tiring day of work. All the workers here are kind, and they all smile as they welcome you. I'll certainly come back and recommend it to all my friends who love coffee!</text>

< Review>
First time here and didn’t notice how to get to the “front” or back of the store so I got in the long line of cars that spilled onto the street and patiently waited until I got to the speaker. When the lady asked what I wanted I let her know I had a mobile order and she responded with: Your drinks are at the front.
and was done. After I passed the speaker AND the window did I realize that the front of the store is accessible through the side ally next to Jack in the box. I had to wait in line the whole time only to get to the front to go and find parking next door because the only spot immediately available without blocking drive thru customers was handicap one. Point Loma and Miramar location are nothing like this one.  They are much friendlier. The drive is worth it.</Review>

Not really friendly. It was our first time there and the guy with glasses came to the front and said to scan that we can just barcode to order and walked away without letting us even ask a question. He didn’t try to offer any support. I don’t know what his problem was but we waited outside and then when our order was ready he just pick it in the pickup window without even letting us know it was ready. He acted very passive aggressive towards us and was maybe taking his bad day out on us. Not the best for a first time experience.</Review>

This is a beautiful little gem in the sunset. They put miraculous detail in their coffee making. I love coming here because the baristas are so lovely, funny, and make me feel super welcomed! The coffee and baked goods are delicious. Although it is on the expensive side, the quality makes up for it. I highly recommend Hollow for all.<//Text>

Thought my experience here may have been an anomaly but looking at some of the previous reviews that discuss the rude staff, it seems to be an accurate description of this location! They need to have an internal discussion about customer service and lose the entitled attitude.</Review>

Great Vibe, Great dishes, Great Coffee. I have to recommend the mango Red bull Smoothie. It tastes delicious, gives you the great mango taste with a bit of a buzz! Check out all their locations for killer decor and special spots.< /review>

The coffee is amazing and service was polite, and quick. Only complaint is the drive through/parking situation isnt too safe and practical. Not alot of food options either. This one is primarily just a coffee shop drive through.<//Review>

As someone with multiple food allergies and sensitives, I appreciate that they're so friendly and willing to customize my coffee. My go-to order is a honey latte with coconut milk (they use So Delicious brand) and no vanilla powder (dairy). It tastes great whether it's hot or iced. Occasionally, I'll add lavender for a slight offset to the sweet honey. Love all of their locations, but this is the one I visit most frequently as it's on my route to work.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I really like the vibe in this place. It's small, but in a trendy fun way. The coffee and tea is wholesome in taste (and, from what I've seen, ingredients too!). There's also a drive through, which is cool for such a small place!</text>

When I think to the time I lived in Pacific Beach, one of the best memories I have is of my frequent stops at Better Buzz Coffee. Whether you're on the way to work, or to the beach for a walk on the boardwalk, Better Buzz is the perfect way to start your day. I recommend their "Best Drink Ever" but half sweet - otherwise it's a little too sugary. Their acai bowls are also a must have. The classic espresso drinks are also great quality - smooth and rich in flavor.</text>

The place is small but very popular. They have a wide variety of coffees and even offer tea. The flavored coffee is a little on the sweet side, but they offer to make it half sweet or less sweet when asked. There's parking at the site that shares it with the Jack in the Box. The drive thru usually has a line, so beware. The staff is sweet and they have a cute thing with Harry Potter at the mall.</Review>

I love the "best drink ever!" Everything I have tried there is great and the service is friendly.< /review>

Vowed I would never go there because of that, but my gf persuaded me to try it on our trip up north. Stopped in and got a Mocha, holy shiot! It was that good, so I see why people wait in line for their coffee. I still prefer to support the small guy coffee shops, but I don't mind swinging in for an occasional mocha.</Review>< username>

So I would give this place a 5 star review only if I actually liked really sugary coffee drinks. My girlfriend suggested this place on our way out of San Diego, so we stopped by. The drive thru had a line into the street, which is a good thing, obviously people love this place. The menu had a long list of different types of coffee drinks to pick from along with juices and blended drinks too.

I ordered the popular drink, I believe it was "the famous coffee" or something along that line. Overall very tasty but once again  it's overkill on the sweetness for me. They did have an option to go half sweetness, so next time I will be trying that and updating my review from there. Starbucks lovers are in for a treat going here!<//review>

Coffee and staff were great, but it was incredibly loud. It was hard to focus on work or even talk to anyone around. Found myself yelling to be able to talk to the person next to me. Would recommend for drive-through drinks but not to hang around in.< /Text>

I rated this place 4 stars because I think a five star type of coffee shop for me would make stronger coffee. I love the decoration at this place, the water bowl outside for the dogs, the game outside and the music, plus free WiFi!! I enjoyed sitting on the comfy swings that Better Buzz have outside. I can’t wait to visit their other location on Hill Crest , my friend said is 10 times bigger than this one here in Pacific Beach.< /Review>

Although the space is small, it does provide a comfortable environment. I went there around 3 PM and there was more than enough parking.

I ordered an Acai Bowl and I thought it was convenient and cute how it was put in a cup that I could take on the go with me.

The employees were enthusiastic and kind to all of the customers.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience and I would recommend stopping by this location of Better Buzzed.< /text>

The slowest drive thru ever, and service was bad and incompetent. I don’t use that word lightly, and this was completely not worth the hype. They chatted for 8 minutes while they took their sweet time making our coffee and getting our order wrong after confirming it with us 2 times.< /Text>

Went out of my way to get a drink before they closed at 7:00pm. Showed up at 6:20 and the place was already closed for the day. All signs posted said 7:00pm daily. Good coffee otherwise.</Text>

Pretty average togo coffee, better than starbucks. They say they make traditional macchiatos but they put so much milk! Its really supposed to be just a dash of foam with espresso.

The pastries are pretty good and they give dog treats.

The price is a bit too high for what it's worth but if you're on the go and need a drive through coffee it might be your best option.< /text>

Delicious!   I'm not a big coffee drinker.  Don't like the bitter taste.  Better  Buzz coffee is smoother than the popular coffee house,  and their Hazelnut Divinity is decadent.</Text>

They are very badly organized! Avoid this place!!
I ordered two acai bowls and waited 45 minutes for the second one! I asked 3 employees about it and they just looked confused and said “it should come out shortly”. In the meantime I saw 4 customers who ordered after me and left with their acai bowls way before mine came out. When it was finally ready it wasn’t even the way I ordered it. I usually go to other Better Buzz location but this was definitely my last time here! Literally can find the same products anywhere else!</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>My black americano had great flavor and the beans were roasted well. The feta avocado toast was perfectly balanced with the right amount of avocado, tomatoes, and feta over the bread (not toasted but great whole grain). My son had the islander açaí bowl and it was large. Would’ve liked a little more granola because like most açaí bowl places there’s an uneven amount of fruit and granola to açaí but overall great blend of flavor. We would definitely order everything again based on the quality, service, and atmosphere. Thanks for a great breakfast BBC!!</review><gmap_id>0x80dc01c79c654487:0xbb6fa8346f72d9ea< /gmap_id>< user_id>

<Review>I normally don’t review places but I was not happy this morning. I have been a customer of Better Buzz since the one in Encinitas opened on the 101. I go for the experience. Not just the coffee. This morning I ordered a 20 oz Americano at the one in Pacific Beach. I stressed three times to the employee extra room and how this was important to me. He didn’t write it down so I assumed he had it down. I typically order my drink this way because I’m not a big fan of the typical American coffee so I like very little water so the espresso gives it a strong taste and I like to drink it black. Well, they call my order. Filled to the top. I tell the lady I ordered extra room. She removes the lid, dumps out a good portion of it and hands it back! That was a whole shot of espresso I just paid $4.04 for! That’s NOT ok! Now, this normally wouldn’t bother me if one person messed up my order, but neither employee cared about my experience. The drink should have been remade as it was super watered down once I received it. I truly hope better buzz improves their customer service. I most likely will not be coming back as that put a very bad taste in my mouth.< /Review>< userid>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Tried Better Buz for the first time today at this location and I loved it! For such a small corner they have going on their service was phenomenal. Service was relatively fast considering the fact that there's a line of customers outside at the drive thru and inside the shop as well. Both the girl taking my order and the gentleman at the window were welcoming and courteous. While waiting for my drink at the window I peeked inside and saw everybody inside doing an amazing job staying on top of things and multitasking. AND what really pushed me to give a review is the fact that I ordered a bagel and they gave me plenty of cream cheese which was sooo nice given the fact that I was going thru the drive thru and wouldn't be able to go back to ask for more. Just small details that show these people really think about their customers and want you to leave satisfied :) thank you guys!< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dc01c79c654487:0xbb6fa8346f72d9ea< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Nice staff with a killer almond milk iced latte!! Even had to buy a bag of espresso beans for $15. Go inside if the drive thru line is long. They're very fast. I park in the jack in the crack lot btw.</Text>< Pictures>

The "Best Drink Ever" might really be one of the best Iced Coffee Drinks ever. The Iced Macha Green Tea was also great!< /Review>

This little drive through is really easy to miss because it's so small. But it's worth finding because they have amazing coffee, a super friendly staff and they get you on your way quickly.</review>

< Review>
The three women working at the time were extremely slow. We sat in the drive thru for 30 mins before trying to order and getting skipped. We pulled up to the window to try to order and the woman working kept repeating my order back to me. I ordered a large hot latte, which she and a co-worker argued over how to make it, and a toasted marshmallow latte, which they also argued over how to make, and both of the lattes ended up with dead shots because it took them too long to pour the espresso. Not worth the $10 I spent and I'll be going to other Better Buzz's and Starbucks.</Review>

<Review>Ordered a cappuccino. First of all, 16 oz as the smallest size? No. The drink was incredibly weak. The espresso either used poor quality bends or was pulled incorrectly as it was slightly bitter. Overall part if you NEED some coffee and don't have a car to get to birdrock, but not worth going out of your way for.</Review><response>None<//response>< username>

If I'd reviewed this place after the first couple visits, I'd have given them 5 stars. Unfortunately, because we (my wife and I) were so impressed, we visited them a number of times over a couple week time period. I'm not sure what happened because they were initially great but over those two weeks they descended to below average. Initially they got all our orders correct the first time, and the drinks were delicious (we have blended mochas, hot mochas, and even the smoothies); but our last several visits have been marred. They've gotten our order incorrect multiple times--in spite of our attempts to ensure they get it down right by repeating it multiple times for clarity--and then, most recently, they burned the espresso (yuck!) when remaking the drink they made incorrectly (I asked for an almond milk mocha--not a coconut milk mocha). In short, they went from well worth the long wait in the drive thru and the prices they charge to completely forgettable and not worth going out of our way for. At this point, given my experiences with Better Buzz on Garnet Avenue, I'd say your chances of getting stellar espresso here aren't any better than they are at any other coffee shop.<//Review>

First time I came here I ordered a latte and got a black coffee. The second time I came here I apparently didn't see how the line was working and skipped a few cars. A customer came up to my window and yelled at us very rudely while we were apologizing and told the barista not to serve us.</review>

(Translated by Google) Kind and efficient service! The girls are super attentive and quick. The coffee is great and the snacks range from healthy to 'over fat' but all delicious! Had a starbucks across the street from our hotelce a Denny's next door but every morning we walked a few blocks just to have a delicious breakfast at Better Buzz Coffee! Life is better buzzed.

(Translated by Google) Very sweet and bad hot chocolate, bad cappuccino and the two breads we ordered were terrible. The sofa not made you want to sit, was dirty.

Chocolate quente muito doce e ruim, capuccino ruim e os dois paes que pedimos estavam péssimos. O sofá não dava vontade de sentar, estava sujo.< /review>

A large pizza was only cut into 6 pieces. When the driver got here she texted me telling me to pick up my phone. I chose to do it over the app so I wouldn't have to speak on the phone. It's very rude to tell someone to pick up their phone. Won't be ordering from here again<//Text>

I hadn't had Pizza Hut in a long time.  There was not one near me.  But we're were out and about and decided to pick one up.  I was very disappointed.  It was a very bland, boring pizza.  The crust used to be so good! Not anymore.  So sad.<//Text>

they got my name wrong, got my order wrong, made me wait for them to get it right, then wanted to charge me for crushed peppers and cheese packets.  I love pan pizza but this is just toomuch trouble, they could not even make the box right it kept popping open on my drive home.< /review>

This is THE NASTIEST pizza I have ever eaten from not only a Pizza Hut, but from any chain period. The pizza was undercooked. I ordered chicken and tomato and the whole thing tastes like pepperoni (which I do NOT eat) and the worst thing is: their wings sucked 😭 wing street is my FAVORITE place to get hot wings and these things tasted like they mixed the last of all the sauces they had on hand together and put it on some super old chicken. This ruined me on Pizza Hut altogether 😢 so if u enjoy pizza DO NOT GO HERE!!</review>

I reluctantly ordered again today. The driver did arrive on time but accidentally dropped my food on the sidewalk. He stated someone would bring out the food again. After an hour, I called and they told me I never answered my door. I have been sitting next to my door for over an hour - no one came. This is rediculous!!

There is a young woman I believe her name is alycia, very sweet girl. Never had someone treat me so kind, especially since my order was done right after the store closed. Most places employees are rushing to leave. She is an asset to your team and deserves a raise! The food was super fresh too!<//text>

<user>112738321168626911009<//user><Review>So I have a debit/credit card that was issued through my work (money network card with Kirkland's through bank of america - since I don't have a direct deposit account and my company does not issue hard copy checks anymore) I tried to place an order with that card and the employee told me that since it does not have my name on the card (it says "valued employee") he was not able to process my order. This is horrible customer service (i work retail) because you guys will not take a form of payment that is completely acceptable anywhere else I've bought from before. There was no manager on duty at the time which again is completely ridiculous to explain the situation to. Pizza Hut was my favorite pizza parlour but now has lost my service if this can not be corrected. I would hate to go anywhere else, but will if necessary"< /Review>< rate>

Delivery girl worked a $10 tip out of me.  It  was Saturday night about 1 month ago and the delivery girl was about 25 y.o, Caucasian, medium to heavy build with dyed bright red/burgundy hair and put forth a somewhat dingy smiley demeanor.  I was originally going to tip her $3 and then she said she didn't have change on her and would have to go back to the car.  She said this as she eyeballed my custom made sofa I had purchased in Los Angeles. I told her she could keep it and didn't have to give me any change (leaving her with a $5 tip at this point). Delivery girl then went on to how she got the total wrong (again playing ditsey girl) and the charge was really $5 more.  At this point I was so disgusted I just gave her the money so she would get away before I made a scene in front of my own apartment.  She seemed very skilled at this so I was pretty sure she had done this before and gotten away with  it.  I complained ti the manager and I was granted a $10 credit, which I used. But my issue and the reason I am still writing this review is this:  when I went to pick up my credit order on a Saturday night the Delivery girl who tries to work the customers was still there (I can live with that).  However I noticed that she was carrying on with the manager in a sing song almost flirty manner, and it was Saturday night, one of the busiest and most profitable days for a delivery person to work. It seems she still had her one of the best shifts at her job, even after this incident.  A week later I called to use my remaining credit and mentioned the incident to the person on the phone to which they replied, "Oh yeah, I don't think she's working her anymore."  To which I responded, "Yes she does, I saw her there last week". I had the impression that this person was trying to protect Delivery girl for some reason and my guess is it has something to do with the male manager.  I will say that the brief dynamic I saw between male manager and Delivery girl was a little too comfortable  and familiar for a typical working relationship.  Well, my point is that you have to watch this Delivery girl if she comes to your door. Because from what I saw there is no real or solid reason she has to quit her antics.  She'll still get to keep her profitable Saturday night shift and still be on chummy terms with her boss.</text>

There is a Home Depot, Staples and other business establishments there. The Albertsons has a stand alone cooler with sushi that is made fresh daily. While I don't care for sushi my girlfriend loves the stuff. And since we are still in the middle of COVID-19 and not going out much this is a great way for her to enjoy one of her favorite foods. It is fresh, flavorful and reasonable priced. If you love sushi you should check it out.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8cmyRR8uGftfrxhvrmQb9NeA2CnaveoDytAnt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRj6iU_hbqDDwHwZUe_GiOULgpZGeUArGrhpGd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOM1Y0lb0CXDKOYII9RyzH9dIGMvHddpswdDQX8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOGWMeQw50T_scbSyjF-6sDq1RAWifCbSjq8Np=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5dV7xGQqpuQgSkGQ6Z0WqC0PNgjxj2jKvHDfD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxYau1lBNZDt9a91gBKmluaIdJtswQTltMIu8Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVyzOJ9P93A0a8Rm0vM8jUnQ7pnusyuPDwRnkY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKfPIRpMKJe9uqNFank5xUIapSeUIAZRXIhvE8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODO-s1Pr8FcQAaOWwmYZl90FYdTOS4VkSl1pVX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtjzNm3plQoJnEl9jfBuj2vjUlug-vTNfDjDc-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrQfg6uNVYVRqo88rSluYygzy6z1zn4h0jIKG3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfUxVrLpHtXUYqX8NUX7f-f_0iJLbMxKmZrzYq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNasnr9rKlHhwFgvVurbwKBrHkFs5dL4UbDjEqU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTHiUuUpiesGxo-Ke7JqIbaur8bpBDrtrq3-d3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2AbNz5VoZpbpPAQ074oUw5s7UXV6XdqY_Jmr2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx2stPa4v8O0wUpnjkBQLd4CGUMnQBZrzhDppf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5N7xLmhFdPuJVMf7wgVTiDihVUmtOHJJZ7gpa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwJUW1sFzeCMSkXG8slWvrvPrJAB8aSOw-DoOL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

It was something that I don't regret, the staff was concerned and willing to help, and I was convinced that this establishment was still in business now even after Covid.</text>

Unlike most shopping centers this one really does have just about everything you need. Its main stores are Albertsons and Home Depot but it also has a bank, gas station, fast food restaurants etc. The best part is that all the locations order on the borders of the shopping mall which gives you a lot of parking I never really putting your car too far from anyone place.< /Text>

Employees just hangout with each other like they're always on break. Asking them for help seems to bother them. There seems to be a party at the back of the store with 5 employees just hanging out while they watch 1 do all the stocking.<//Review>

Very nice experience.  I haven't been there in a while,  so I really enjoyed  all the shops and eatery's.  I got my walk in, my people watching  in and all the new shops that I hadn't seen before. All in all good time. It was a good family outing.< /Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>I went there to get a smaller microwave oven. The one I had was too big for my tiny kitchen. But my Uncle Scrooge will make me a cart for the microwave and the KitchenAid Toaster oven. The microwave oven that I bought the box is smeller than my old microwave over. 😣Good purchase. I used the microwave oven last night to make my Morningstar Farms Buffalo Chik'n wings. I'm using it tomorrow morning for my breakfast sandwich 🌯🥞🥖< /text><Time>1555201553297<//Time></record>

This is awesome Carson Depot. Its a really great and friendly place. Plumbing racks are not the best everything is mixed up. Shops inside and out is really and it was welcoming place as well.</Text>

<Text>I went there to get a smaller microwave oven. The one I had was too big for my tiny kitchen. But my Uncle Scrooge will make me a cart for the microwave and the KitchenAid Toaster oven. The microwave oven that I bought the box is smeller than my old microwave over. 😣Good purchase. I used the microwave oven last night to make my Morningstar Farms Buffalo Chik'n wings. I'm using it tomorrow morning for my breakfast sandwich 🌯🥞🥖</Text>< time>

Its a really great and friendly place. Plumbing racks are not the best everything is mixed up. The wood section is the best . Gardening side is beautiful, you have your own help counter, for the paint department.  Beautiful woman work there. Tool section is amazing love the quality of tools they have . Makita and Milwaukee being my most favorite.<//review>

I was due at a petsitting job and my phone's battery died on me leaving my GPS useless. I couldn't find the address and it was getting late. The charger in my car wasn't giving me enough to open my contacts. I remembered that Staples has computers, and I just needed 2 minutes to access my email. They close at 9pm. I got there at 8:56. Their doors were already locked.  I motioned to a clerk and the manager and gestured that I needed help. They just turned away ignoring me.< /Text>

I understand certain things i dont have control of but it is a family store.  Just keep your party weekend stories for your lunch or breaks..</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Rented a truck for 75 minutes from here to pick up a washer machine.  This process was s breeze.  All I needed was my license, proof of insurance  and my credit card. I was charged $50 and then refunded $26 when I returned the truck. I did put about $3 worth of gas in, we didn't drive the truck very far and probably didn't need to put any in but I wasn't getting charged some absurd amount. The gentleman in the tool rental where I got the truck was great, he knew his stuff and was just very courteous.  He made sure i was good driving and set to go.  Renting the truck from Home Depot is super easy!< /review>

They have everything you need and if they don't have it you don't need it. Store is well maintained for the most part courteous and professional staff.

Although when I was checking out with one item I wanted to use the cashier while she directed me towards self check out I told her I did not know how to use the machine she abruptly scanned my one item at self-checkout and walked away quickly.<//Review>

I do not like the traffic flow pattern. It makes driving into the property difficult. Parking spaces are tight. Just not enough room to park and then trying to exit the vehicle far too difficult.</Review>

All entrances into this shopping center are off center! You enter from Lomita Blvd and like 20 feet after entering, you have to stop for cross traffic because they don't have a stop. It should be the other way around. The shopping center has good stores. Home Depot, Staples and a supermarket that is very clean and quite large! There are fast food restaurants on the East corner and parking there is very tight and difficult! There's an awkwardly placed gas station and getting in and out of it is like a game of chicken. They need to redesign the parking lot to make stores more easily accessible. It's kind of a rat's maze< /review>

Very expensive and disappointed with the customer service.  But all in all since its the only depot in the city we'll just have tp put up with high prices and crumby service reps.</Text>

Busy shopping center with Home Depot, Albertsons and Staples being the major stores.  Add a bunch of places to eat like McDonalds and Wing Stop; a gas station and Chase bank and it makes for steady traffic.< /Text>

< Review>
This place is huge and Beautiful everything is well taken care of .. I only find that customer are always looking for help with a store employee and only to be waiting on a an employee who lacks knowledge of what i am  looking for! I ALWAYS either have to figure it  out what im looking for or be turned away from an employees who doesnt understand what i am looking for! Dont like going to a store to be turned away sorry Depot get more employees knowledgeable in what  you sell like   the products you carry!< /Review>

Home Depot just like all others. Big place, lots of tools and hardware. Public restroom at back of store, hard to find help when needed.< /review>

<Text>This place is huge and Beautiful everything is well taken care of .. I only find that customer are always looking for help with a store employee and only to be waiting on a an employee who lacks knowledge of what i am  looking for! I ALWAYS either have to figure it  out what im looking for or be turned away from an employees who doesnt understand what i am looking for! Dont like going to a store to be turned away sorry Depot get more employees knowledgeable in what  you sell like   the products you carry!</Text>< pics>

I think the store is running scams. Xeroxed papers taped to merchandise offering sale prices that they don't honor at the register.<//Text>
