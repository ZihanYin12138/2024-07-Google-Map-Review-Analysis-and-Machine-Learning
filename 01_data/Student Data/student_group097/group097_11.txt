< Review>
I'm very disappointed, I was expecting an authentic raspado but had nothing but the opposite. First the ice is not really shaved as it's supposed to, it's CRUSHED ice as you can see in the pictures I posted. It feels like I'm eating a cup of small ice cubes with flavoring, nothing special about it. Even the guys who walk around pushing a cart selling raspados give you better quality and finer SHAVED ice than this. Come on the place is called Raspadito you should excel in this.< /Review>

<text>First off, I'd like to mention that I have personally never reviewed a restaurant online. However, this particular establishment surprised me with its off-putting cashier lacking basic customer service. To my dismay, this place has several reviews acknowledging its "good" customer service. The woman that helped us seemed to be in an irritated state. This was reflected with her very annoyed responses. It goes without saying that one of the key fundamentals to good customer service is respect. Placing a woman with an inconvenient mentality jeopardizes the perception of what is reflected in the reviews. To the woman that helped us; have the decency to use your brain once in a while when assisting customers. You chose this job, so show me the respect I deserve you shortsighted fool.  I have no doubt that I will never recommend this place to anyone. I understand that my business will not be missed, but I can assure you that your sub-par foods and deserts won't be missed either. A final word of advise to this business; A well-crafted customer service policy is something businesses of all sizes should practice, day in and day out.
Btw, the woman should brush her yellow teeth. It is disgusting having an untidy cashier assist with one's food. You know who you are you slob.<//text>< pics>

I went there last week and the girl gave me an attitude the whole time. You can clearly tell she didn’t want to be there! I didn’t catch her name but she has green eyes. On top of that the esquite tasted disgusting I will not be back!!< /review>

Used to come here an average of for to six times per month for our sir craving.  At least there reason per order for work. Everyone else is on a diet kick so we haven't been back in the last couple months.  Used to phone in our order, no problems; but the last time they implemented a new policy that you have to pay before they start making them.  Girl wasnt clear on that and when I showed up they weren't ready.  Bummer. A bit inconvenient.  That's about the time we stopped going. But one day, might think about returning.< /Review>

You know you're getting a good quality raspado and you always know you're drinking something clean with clean ingredients. I mean my gosh they keep this shop so clean you could slurp your raspado off the floor! I love it when the owner makes my raspado because he makes it just right but when his employee makes it for me her version of just right is a little too spicy for me. Don't get me wrong I love spicy but I don't love heartburn 😜 I mean this is probably like the fancy Jamba Juice of raspado shops. I wish there were more locations ❤️</Review>< pictures>

Found this treasure today by mere coincidence.. What an amazing place! Super clean and neat.
The raspados are so authentic! Just like what we used to have on our vacations in Guadalajara growing up. Everything is natural and made from scratch..none of that artificial gooey stuff others use. The flavors are prepared to perfection..awesome variety of flavors. Had the privilege  of meeting the owner, Oscar. Super nice, down to earth person that wants and makes sure his customers are happy and satisfied with the service they receive. I can't wait for him to open a place in South County. We definitely need something like this there. They would undoubtedly be a hit. Until then , I'll be driving to Santa Ana to satisfy my craving of authentic raspados and to try all the other neat treats and yummy stuff they sell.
Today we tried the walnut and coconut  (you can mix flavors too) as well as the pineapple.
OUTSTANDING!!!!! Can't wait til next time to try something new. Thanks Oscar for bringing this to the O.C.!!!</review>

The concept of Mexican raspado is great, the problem is that they are not using the correct foam cups and  don't use the correct syrups to enriching the raspado, instead they are using a clear plastic cup and a very diluted  liquid syrup this combinations makes the raspado  loose the icy consistency very rapidly  and became a water with ice if the owner change how to served the raspado it will be the best of Orange County.</review>

<Resp>{'time': 1524715920181, 'text': 'Ay Carlitos disculpe pero “concept”? My family has been doing Raspados in Tijuana for over 30 years. You are 100% correct in that we don’t use “syrups to enrich” our Raspados, we use; coconuts, strawberries, mangos, ciruelas, pistachos, nuez, mamey etc etc just to name a few. And while we probably used to use styrofoam cups in the past, they are extremely hazardous to the environment (not biodegradable) and outlawed in most cities in Orange County.\n\nWe were extremely picky with our ice selection and went through many vendors to pick the perfect consistency. Out of the many reviews on Google and Yelp (137), this is the first time my ICE has been an issue and I can bet no one will suggest using foam cups any time soon.\n\n¡Mi Raspa es Su Raspa!'}</Resp>< GmapID>

It's been over six months since I've come here but sadly, I did not have the experience that so many others did. Maybe it was an off day? We got nachos, the esquites with the hot Cheetos topping and a chamoy and mango drink (I don't remember what it was called.) The drink was fine, I just prefer it made differently and to be honest I'm not sure if the way I like it is the authentic way or not. The nachos weren't anything great and the esquites were not up to par. But also keep in mind that I didn't like the hot Cheetos topping, it was a bit stale.

I did give them some stars because we didn't have to wait long, there was only one other person there and the lady was kind enough to wait for us while I decided what I wanted.< /text>

This furniture store is unique.  You can walk around without being harrased by a sales person.  They have much to choose from.  Something for every taste.< /review>

<Review>Me and my family found this furniture store moving here from the bay area. I was extremely impressed by the service  and most importantly the prices are very reasonable. I received free delivery since i live here in town that alone was a savings of over 50 dollars! Will be coming back for sure !</Review></record></dataset><record>

The customer service is ok but be careful because the lady told us something was included and then delivery day came and she trued to switch up her story so make sure everything they say is included with purchase is on your receipt. Other than that they fixed there mistake and it was ok.<//review>

Moderately easy access from two different street's, limited parking space available, parking lot is unpaved. Place of business is also accessible by cement ramp and there is delivery service by a box moving truck available. Prices are fair, the staff is friendly & helpful..

< Review>
Always when I call nobody answers. A lot of stress and lies. When they say they will deliver my furniture today they don't even show up and don't even bother to call. Next day after a couple of attempts to talk to them all they say it will be there today. I don't recommend . 😡</Review>

< Review>
We bought a sofa set with chase and very next day after purchase the pillows were all out of shapes. We brought pillows to Turlock shop but then had to bring at Modesto shop to be filled up and reshaped we had to make numerous trips and kept asking them to fix them or return or exchange it but they just giving us hard time running around. We are now seeking legal action to honor warranty.
Bad service and lots of head aches and stress.
Not recommend</Review>

<Text>I would leave a lower review if i could honestly, i had the worst experience here. I purchased a bedroom set in the Turlock location where they claimed to call me on Monday to let me know whether it would be delivered by the next Tuesday or Wednesday and nothing. I called and no answer, I had to SHOW UP and ask what was happening then the guy who i made the purchase with, Tony,  resumed to tell me it would be delivered the next day by 3 pm. Next day I get a call from the Modesto location telling me THEY DIDNT EVEN HAVE IT. And just a few days after inserting my debit card for the purchase my account was EMPTIED and suddenly after they just didn’t care less if i continued with the purchase. These people are a JOKE AND POSSIBLY SCAMMERS DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME.<//Text>< pictures>

They do a good job... sometimes you might feel your car don't belong because of all the hood rich vehicles you might see. Best carwash in the area!</Text>

They're pretty efficient and fast.  They cleaned both inside and outside of my 2016 Toyota Camry quite promptly. I am satisfied with the job...especially since I'm too lazy to clean it myself 😂😂😂< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2b7d3cfa604a5:0x74992b44890bae40</gmap_id></record>

I used to love to bring my car here because they did a very detailed job all for $10, now the price is $12 and I can barely get someone to wipe the inside of the car down. I thought that was part of the service and least it used to be. Price went up and service went down< /text>

I don’t know what I would have done without the highly professional, efficient and friendly services of Junk King Temecula.  My mother passed away unexpectedly and I had to clear out her residence.  I scheduled an appointment online at the last minute and was contacted the next day to confirm.  The gentlemen who were assigned to my job communicated well with updates to the arrival time; gave a very fair and accurate estimate; and completed the the removal very efficiently and with great attitudes.  It was so hot outside and I just am amazed at how hard these guys worked.  Their services were worth every single penny.  I would highly recommend them to anyone for their services.< /text>

<Text>Driver called ahead (ahead of schedule), was at our home, had the waste items loaded, payment completed, all within about 30 minutes.
Driver was very pleasant and obviously quick. Very professional.
Would definitely use Junk King again - this was my second time using them.
Highly recommended!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dc9d11987e6891:0x309827ee6d78094c<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We let the scheduler know it was a 2 man job.  Only 1 came.  He said he would return in 1 1/2 hour with a second man.  He was true to his word.  We needed the upstairs  TV out today since tomorrow the stair lift is being installed.  It worked out.
The crew was clean and courteous.<//Review>

<Review>I could not thank the three gentleman who came out enough. I had Richard, Richard, and Victor all highly recommended. Hard working, polite, and professional. As a fellow service man myself I treated them with the respect they deserve and I got more back in return. Thank you gentlemen, thank you Junk King!</Review>< Time>

The guys call to see if they could come early and that was awesome! They gave me a very fair quote and we’re done in a timely manner. Best part was there positive attitudes and energy! Even in the hot Murrieta heat!< /review>

<Review>The Junk King Temecula was so easy to schedule. The gentlemen very friendly and professional. They called 20 minutes before the appointment to let us know they were on their way, they showed up at the scheduled time, and they were done filling up their truck very quickly. What a great value! I would definitely use their service again, and highly recommend anyone who needs junk removal to use Junk Kings Temecula!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Text>This company was quick and efficient. They responded in a timely manner and communication was excellent. They did run a little late, but promptly called to let us know. It wasn't an issue at all. The only thing that bothered me a little bit is that I received a quote for $178 online. When they arrived, they said it looked to be as though there were more items than expected. They then changed the price to $398. There were indeed a few more items, but the price jump seemed a bit steep. I am on a time crunch so I had no choice but to agree. When all said and done they had given a total of $350 instead, which did seem more fair to me. Overall, I do recommend their service. They did an excellent job and they were very professional. The guys who came were very well mannered and polite. The only recommendation would be to maybe broaden the quote amount to leave some room so  that there are no surprises in price.<//Text>< Pics>

When he and his associate arrived he immediately quoted me a price he let me know what all the  price included and what type of payment they took. He informed me that he was their to give me an estimate which I liked because if I was not able to have my junk removed today after my estimate I could set up another date for removal. He was on time !! A little earlier to be exact which I loved !!! And was very quick on getting my junk out of my apartment  the experience was awesome Steven and his helper was awesome and I will most definitely be using Junk King again.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>We used Junk King to remove a refrigerator from our home. We got a quote via text. They responded quickly and were very friendly. We were quoted a good price and we set up our appointment for the next day. The guys removing the refrigerator got to our home a little earlier than expected and we’re very professional and friendly. They were done in a matter of minutes. Overall great experience. We will use them in the future if needed and suggest this company to anyone needing to haul things away.</review><UserId.>114462443659253486802<//UserId.>< name>

Richard & Steve showed up at my house promptly and got the job that was asked done in a very efficient amount of time! Quoted a fair price and cleared the items that I wanted disposed of quickly and efficiently. These two guys are awesome and I will be recommending their services to friends and family if their services are needed in the future! Thanks again guys, job well done!< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I had the pleasure of meeting Richard. He was on time, and very professional in the way he conducted himself. Right off the bat he assessed the load and gave me a very reasonable quote, and explained why it cost that much (which I appreciated very much). Even though it was just him, he was quick and efficient. If Richard is a reflection of the Junk King company, I would gladly keep going to them, and suggest them to others. 5 Stars!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>These guys are great!  They showed up on time and were incredibly professional and friendly.  I had a ton of yard trash that I needed gone.  These guys moved fast and had everything loaded in the truck in 15 minutes.  I really appreciate their hard work.  They also give military discounts.  It was easy to schedule.  I did it all online.  I would use them again because it was convenient and they were professional.  The website doesn’t provide an estimate but they provide you an estimate before they start working.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Late, short and rushing. They were late and I had a patient on the line and they rang the door bell as they clearly saw me working. They picked up only what was in the box and left some foam. Disappointed as they were pricey for picking up one microwave in the box and one microwave box.<//review>

Used them to clean out my storage unit. The drivers were courteous and prompt in coming out to give me an estimate. They provided the best price of 3 estimates. When they came to pick up my items, they were again, prompt and courteous, and the office staff is very professional and nice. Will use Junk King again if I need them, and would highly recommend them.< /text>

I normally don't just give five stars to a place, but this time I felt I needed to. Even though the time slot I chose to pick up my old mattress was between 12pm -2pm, and the driver didn't get here until waaayyy after 3pm, the fact that he was very friendly and professional, really impressed me. The driver's name was "Steven Garcia", and the guy had already made a bunch of pick-ups, had a broken arm, and was working in over 100 degree heat. The price to be honest, was still a bit steep to pick-up a California King mattress, but it was better than having to drive all the way up to the dump. Will I use them again and refer them? Most likely.</Review>

We hired Junk King to remove some large boxes, old electronics, and misc items. The biggest item was an old, heavy box tv which needed to come down our stairs and into their truck... Richard, Victor, and Steve were amazing! They were fast, efficient and able to give us a quote on the spot. Would definitely recommend and hire them again as needed!< /Text>

They are very hard working, professional and organized. They were in and out in no time. Also are very kind, polite and helpful. I highly recommend Junk King.

<Text>The gentleman who picked up our junk was great. I wish Junk King had a policy about cleaning up debris from carrying items around to get to the truck as it was left quite a mess. We are still in the process of cleaning it all up an hour later. Our hauler didn’t have any help and we had a lot of junk. I really feel like there should always be teams of two for safety reasons alone. He had to get an easily 500 lb handicap shower into that truck and nothing about doing that alone is safe. However our hauler was very polite, friendly, and on time and we are happy to have everything finally gone. Overall a good service but could be improved. Again nothing against our hauler.<//Text>< name>

Steven and Richard were incredibly efficient and went so far above and beyond to get our old waste removed! This was a 2 truck load job including lots of old furniture and the base of an adjustable bed that did not want to come apart. They were so pleasant and friendly even with all the problems that came up during the removal. Would absolutely recommend them!< /review>

They showed up when they said they would and were extremely professional. They also did an amazing quick job and collecting our junk and didn’t charge as much as other companies. Will absolutely use again in the future if we do more renovations 👍🏻</review>

Steven at Junk King was very professional, he was early for his pick-up time and great to talk to. We had a great conversation and I appreciate the person-ability of it all. The cost of the service was very reasonably priced and I will definitely recommend him to my friends and neighbors.< /Text>

I needed a couch removed. They called a few minutes ahead of the pickup, arrived toward the start of the estimated window of time, and were finished and out of the apartment within less than 5 minutes. I highly recommend them.<//review>

Overall great experience, I was initially seeking a dumpster rental after a large garage clean out. Saw Junk King online instead and they had a team out within 2 hrs. Quick and easy process would definitely recommend.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>These guys came on short notice for a same day service.  I was given a $99-$170 estimate over the phone for a small load, that actually kept growing the more I worked while waiting for them.

These guys have great attitudes, courteous, professional and gentlemen.  Customer service you can tell doesn’t just matter to them, it comes naturally.

They came on time.  Lots of cardboard in my mess and lots of bags with plastics and cardboard, and foam etc.  they came out and was a bit more than they expected as I had added more while waiting for them.  Honored a $156 price and I considered it very fair.

This was more than could fit in a small city dumpster from Waste Management.  I had used 2 dumpsters already prior to calling Junk Kings for the 3rd loss at $150 each that’s $300 for 2 small green city dumpsters - and crackheads kept going through my personal stuff at all hours with those city dumpsters you leave at the street (you can’t lock them) and that’s not cool with personal info in the trash... and I had too much stuff to shred that I didn’t.

I should have just called Junk Kings from the beginning - even if I would have filled their truck with what I used in 2 city dumpsters and what they picked up total, it would have been far less to just use Junk Kings from the beginning.  Don’t kid yourself and think anything else is a better option.  These guys are the way to go.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Well, I really can't say enough about what a pleasure it was working with Stephen from Junk Kings. The guy showed up super early, after a polite phone call to confirm it was alright. After getting here, he handled a slew of trash and boxes by himself in half of the time I expected. If you're looking for a well spoken, respectable guy to give you a hand, this is your man! 10/10< /text>

<review>When I called to get an estimate, Lupe was wonderful and worked around my schedule. When the two young men came to give me the estimate, I had them go ahead and load up the truck. Chris and the other person (I wish that I could remember his name - I'm old) were friendly, fast, and efficient. Definitely a 5-star experience. Thank you!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The guys that showed up were on top of it; I appreciated the direct conversation with no-nonsense work ethic. While the costs was higher than I would’ve expected, after you factor in gas, time, dump fees, and availability; it was worth IMO.<//text>

<text>Junk King Temecula is an excellent service! They came recommended to me by my parents and sister, and I couldn't have chosen a better company. Richard and George, especially;  were helpful,  fast and efficient, kind and courteous. The price was unbeatable and I couldn't be happier with their service. I will use them for any and all future needs. Thank you, George and Richard! Thank you, Junk King of Temecula!< /text>< pictures>

This was our second time using Junk King and we are once again very pleased with the efficiency of the workers in moving bulky items. Steven and the other two young gentlemen with him are gems! We will definitely be calling them again when we have items to get rid of. Thank you Junk King!!<//review>

Both George and Richard did an awesome job! They were 10 min early before schedule and hauled all of our junk out. The cost was reasonable as well. We definitely will use them again. They even took our deep freezer which was too large for our garage and a heavy old metal filing cabinet from upstairs. Thank you George and Richard!< /text>

They were super nice, very professional,  And did an extraordinary job. Nothing was too small or big. They asked me questions if they weren’t sure what to take. The rate was fair.Two great guys I would definitely. Use junk King again. I. Am recommending. Jack King to all my friends.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<name>Celeste Ross<//name><Date>1499100443827< /Date><Text>Junk Kings was amazing. I was in a tough spot trying to clean out my dads house, and they came in and got pretty much everything. They pay attention to detail and make sure they don't toss anything that you might want to keep. They also came to the house I was moving out of, twice. They came on the day I turned in the keys and helped me get all the last bits of trash and things. Great people to work with, honestly. I would never even think of using anyone but junk kings when I move. Even if you just want to clean out your garage, call junk kings. Pricing is fair and honest. Overall they are just nice people. Best experience I've had in a long time. Justin and his team are great to work with!!<//Text>< Pictures>

Richard, Steven, and Victor are the nicest young men around. I was very emotional about letting go of my piano and when Richard noticed it he said some very nice things to help me. They were careful with it and made me feel like they were the boys next door helping me move a family piece to a new home. It was not an easy piece to move; an old player piano easily three times the weight of a regular upright. They moved it as gracefully as possible and didn't give it the slightest bump or nick.

I called the "boss" right away and told him about the men and how careful, compassionate and caring they were. He was just as kind. He took great pride in knowing his company was represented well. He made it a point to say that it's one thing to hire strong guys to lift "stuff" and it's entirely another thing to hire good men to haul away your items with as much care as possible - both for the item and for the customer.

In today's corporate world, it's not always easy to find a company with compassionate employees who are able to assess how someone is feeling and make them a little more comfortable. These three did just that. And, clearly, the owner is mindful of this.

I will definitely call these gentlemen again when we do some spring cleaning and I will absolutely recommend them to everyone I know.

Oh! And the price was well within reason. It was, in fact, the lowest quote I got. But all in all, what I valued most was how kind this group of young men were.

Thank you, Justin, for hiring great guys.
Thank you, Richard, Steven, and Victor, for making this morning a little easier for me. I appreciate you.< /Review>

I didn’t know what to expect when choosing junk King. They were on time, The gentleman wore a mask the whole time, he was proficient and did a great job of hauling away all of my junk. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who asks.</review>

I just wanted to share that today Steven did a great job cleaning the junk out of our yard as well as speaking very positive about the company that he works for. He seems to really love his job as well as pleasing the customers. . My husband and I were very pleased. I also  wAnted to thank Jason (the Boss) as well for being very supportive. He has to be a very nice guy to have such a great crew. And also I would like to thank Victor and the other guy who came along later to complete the job. Victor was very nice and respectful as well and so was the other guy. I look forward to referring and/or doing business with you all in the future 😊 I would give you all an “A” for great customer service starting with the receptionist Alexa ( I believe that was her name) Steven, Victor, the other guy and most of all Jason!  Thanks again and keep up the good work! Mrs Fite<//text>

<rate>1<//rate><Resp>None< /Resp><Text>Called to say they will be late and gave me a new window. That new window came and went and I had to call them they asked if we can do it another say and I said NO as it was my day off, he gave me a new window and said he will work with me on price since I was inconvenienced. After waiting almost all day . 3 guys came in and gave me no leeway on the quote even though they said they will work with me due to fact they didnt show up on time and kept pushing my time frame back.  I had no choice I needed the furniture gone. They were in a rush and 1 of the guys was taking my box spring down stairs and nearly fell down the stairs had I not caught him. After research I released I was overcharged.  I helped de assemble the bed railing as they had no tools and wanted to demolish it in bedroom. Again overcharged waited all day even though I set an appointment  a week in advance and they changed time frame 3 times wasting my whole Saturday.  Had i not been in a tough situation i would def not use them. I have never felt the need to leave a review but the level of service was that bad.< /Text></record>

<Review>Had a bunch of bulky items from Spring Cleaning. Didn’t want to wait for WM to pick it up, plus it was prob too much. Contacted Junk King Temecula to see what their availability was for a pick up. Was surprised that thy were available later that afternoon! They called to notify me that they were close and could come early. I was pleased to let them come right away. The two gentlemen grabbed my stuff, loaded it up and were done in minutes! It was so fast! (and I had a lot of stuff!) If you’re thinking about taking your stuff to the dump or calling WM to pick it up, call Junk King Temecula first! The price was reasonable and the guys were fantastic!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>Steve and George were awesome! Very stressful when they came out, trying to get rid of some junk and my elderly mother was there watching and felt a bit confused. They were very fast, kind and lifted our spirits with their humor. My mom’s house was hot and uncomfortable...no matter, these guys weren’t fazed and smiled the entire time. Thank you so much for your speed and professionalism!<//review>< Pics>

The Junk Kings Temecula provide me with exceptional customer service the entire Team /staff members are responsible for responding to customers, engaging with them, and following up to endure my satisfaction with there service, they go beyond the services to endure their customers budget customer service,

I was in need of varies items removed from my home, and yard, so I called. Junk Kings Temecula, I was so impressed from my first phone call, the service rep was knowledgeable and quoted me, what I need, they were so flexible and quick with placing me on the schedule. The Two men arrived on time, they were They were Most efficient, professional, and kind, they handle my items with care, they listen to my request, then quickly went to work, while creating a friendly environment, I have suffered injuries in the past that cause me to be fearful  of others, I never once felt uncomfortable around them, Steve and his crew place a smile on my face. Again, moving twice in the past year, I have never encounter such outstanding excellent customer service. I Highly recommended them to all whom need Items removed from the home or yard.  Thank you.

The young men that came to take my stuff were very professional and did not try to charge me more than quoted. Cheerful personalities made this a much easier transaction, and it was good to know that the stuff that could be recycled or reused would be. Thank you!<//text>

My back said it had enough with the 450lbs of concrete in my front yard project. I was about to load the concrete in my truck and take it to a local concrete recycling center. Then I found Junk King. For $15 more than what I would of paid the recycling center Junk King would come out and haul it away. My back was so happy! Junk King arrived the same day. Five minutes later my concrete was a distant memory.< /review>

They got rid of a garage full of junk, and some stuff that was just plain trash, at a reasonable price. They were easy to work with, arrived when they said they would, and removed everything like they said they would. They did not pick and choose which items they would take like some companies do. My only disappointment is that they do not take paint or oil but I understand why.<//Text>

They had to reschedule a Saturday appointment, but told me in advance, and they were so grateful when we were perfectly fine rescheduling for the following Saturday. They kept me notified of when they would be at my house and again thanked us for being flexable.  Very nice guys, very professional and they cleaned up eveything!</Text>

Do not use this service. The company I work for hired Junk King to remove unwanted trash from the facility and we were quoted a price to remove everything. After removing some of the items we were told there would be an additional fee to remove the rest of the items. Typical bait and switch. I've tried to contact Justin Oakley numerous times but still haven't heard back.<//text>

<review>As a Simplicity and Decluttering coach, I know some challenges people have in actually getting rid of STUFF that is no longer used or needed. I also know that a lot of my clients along with myself want to minimize what goes into the landfill (thus holding onto to the STUFF and continuing to clutter our lives).
The Junk King is easy to schedule, honors their time window, are quick and efficient when they show up, friendly, and reasonably priced. In addition, I know they try to recycle or reuse as much as they pick up minimizing what goes to the landfill ( which is what your local waste management company would do with a big haul.)
I consider the cost an investment in our well-being and in our environment.
If you have items that you just don’t know what to do with, let these guys take care of it.
I’ve used them twice and both times they have been a pleasure to work with.
Thank you, Junk King of Temecula!<//review>< gmap_id>

My company hired this company to come pick up trash and Very disappointed, this company left a miss, and we still ended up cleaning it  wasted valuable time. Never again will I use this service and I will be sure to tell others about my experience.

I got a quote over the phone for replacement glass but they waited til I came in to tell me that was for generic glass. It was a $25 upgrade for Apple glass.

This place is honestly amazing. i’ve been to multiple locations and they were all giving me high prices such as $180, $170, even as high as $200. my phone has been getting worse and worse everyday and i was starting to panic because i didn’t have that type of money. This is the first place that came up on my suggestion page for google and i gave em a call and they gave me a low price !! i came in and he had it done in less than 20 minutes!! so fast and easy. i appreciate this store so much, it really came in clutch and saved me. i’m definitely coming back. if i could give this place 6 stars i would.< /Text>

Definitely disappointed that I paid $180 to fix my iPhone and a few days later I have 2 new problems that i never had before they touched it! And not covered on the 30 day warranty.And want more money to fix they new problems they probably caused.Thanks guys for ripping off people that try to support local small businesses.< /text>

Chris was kind and even took time to smooth(file)out the edges of my phones busted corners. I would highly recommend anyone coming here and getting their phone fixed. Ah and he even placed a phone screen I had bought online for me as well as my case. Thank you!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><rate>5<//rate>< date>

Pierce is good specialist. Excellent, quikly repair, friendly attitude and recommendations on the correct charging of the battery in my IPhone. So the destruction of my device was prevented and I saved money on buying a new IPhone.</Review>

<Text>I came here to get my cracked screen replaced. After being told one price over the phone and a more expensive one in person, I was then told that the screen was aftermarket but that it was “the same thing, the colors just aren’t as bright.” I asked to see what it would look like to decide how much of the “same thing” it really was, so the guy takes my phone and goes in the back for a good 10 minutes. He comes back with the aftermarket screen on and everything about it was beyond horrible. The screen quality, the feel, the responsiveness. Definitely not the same thing. And definitely not worth the $100
+tax it was going to cost. So I ask him to change it back and put my original screen back on, that I’ll think about it. So he goes and does that.

I leave and in my car, I immediately notice that there are 3 BRAND NEW scratches at the top of the screen near the earpiece. Deep, very visible scratches. The kind that someone keying your car would make. And not only that, the screen for the earpiece itself was completely mangled.
There was no mention of this at all from him, so I’m pretty sure he was hoping that I wouldn’t notice. But I did.

I was just going to put up a one star review, and leave it at that. But the owner responded to my original rating with a lovely and professional “FAKE REVIEW” so I felt obligated to update my review and actually include a description this time. Some grade A customer service at show.

Absolutely do not recommend you go here.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1578048740611, 'text': 'FAKE REVIEW'}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
They do not care about their customers. My phone was ruined and owner specifically would not stand behind their workmanship. See photo how they eventually returned my phone. I brought my WORKING phone in to get a new battery, they ensured me it would take 1 hour. They ruined my phone and promised they would fix it and if they couldn't they would replace it. 1 month of stringing me along that they were going to repair it. I asked them to purchase me a replacement phone of same phone (not looking for a new phone) Just something that was working. I thought that was reasonable and they initially agreed. But after more weeks of waiting, they have decided to not make me whole on my phone. Instead they returned my phone as a pile of parts.  This is a bad business and I would definitely not suggest you give them any business.<//Review>

I went in with a small probelm on my phone and they changed my whole screen, my phone not even a week later started having problems again and with a case and screen protector cracked due to the screen not being put on right.I went in to get it fixed and they wanted me to repay the whole thing when they messed it up! do no suggest unless you want to take a ton of money out!</Review><userid>116687411900060814808</userid><Rating>1< /Rating>< Date>

<Text>DO NOT bring your phone here! Worst customer service ever! These people are extremely unprofessional. Similar to other negative views, I too had to deal with excuses, lies and much time wasted to have my phone fixed over and over because the they kept putting a defective screen on it.

One month it has been and I still haven't recieved my phone. I have to keep calling and chasing them down. They always tell my that the phone will be ready next day and then it isn't. Unbelievable the way this place operates.<//Text>< Pictures>

Chris is the owner of this Mobile device repair store here in Tarzana. Not only is he super nice, he goes out of his way to make sure your super happy. If you want to watch him take apart your phone and repair it right in front of you, he actually enjoys showing you how the repair gets done as well as answers any questions you may have. He's like the coolest "nerd" I've meet in a while. I think being a nerd is actually a good thing so hopefully he'll find my comment a compliment.

Not only does he not just fix iPhones and iPads, he'll repair all Android phones and devices as well. His prices also beat anyone I've called and gotten a quote from.

An all around good guy that offers a good service for a good price. A pleasure to do business with.< /Text>

< review>
I first came in to sherman oaks location for a simple cracked screen. I was told it would take a few days. I came back maybe 30 times, and each time they were either randomly closed during the day or i got an excuse that there was a new problem. Finally after coming back after 30 times, i was told since they messed up and caused such a hassle that they would not charge me for fixing the screen and even included a free case. That is when i noticed they broke the home button. I told them i need that fixed because they broke it. Again, they told me come back a few days later. I did. I came back another 10 times and again they were randomly closed. Eventually i was able to get in the store and there was a new guy there. He told me this previous employee messed up over 10 devices and that they needed to send the ipad to tarzana location to get home button fixed. After another month, when they finally fixed it, the owner wanted to charge me, even though i was told it would be free, because they messed up my ipad. Not only that, when i touched the screen, it would change colors, and the owner actually tried convincing me that that was normal. (When i first notcied home button broken, the screen was fine, but now, the tarzana location fixed home button but somehow messed up the screen) I was furious. But i wanted it over with so i was going to pay by credit card, when all of a sudden the owner said cash only. Even though i saw other customers paying by card... side note, i had to figure out that the tarzana location was his shop too because otherwise they would never have reached out to me. They never reached out to me once. I had to chase them down for over 3 months. Finally they returned my ipad without the screen and i had to get a refurbished one for 150.

The owners are the most unprofessional, rude, and most distasteful liars i have ever seen.

Save your precious time, energy, and money and go somewhere where they keep their word, and treat you right, the first time.

Im surprised the Better Business Bureau hasnt shut them down already. These guys are the shadiest people in the business.< /review>

The level of professionalism and experience here is absolutely impeccable. In a a matter of minutes they restored my broken screen back to the manufacture's condition -- it looks and feels like a brand new phone! By far the best Iphone repair store in Los Angeles; would highly recommend to anyone.< /text>

Staff was very helpful. They kindly sized my foot, told me what to watch out for when walking in them, and offered a free oiling on my boots. Overall great experience, I would come back to get another pair of boots.< /Review>

The staff here were very helpful and helped me pick out the best boots for me needs, these are the second pair of these boots. The last pair lasted me about 4 years and were some of if not the best pair of work boots I’ve ever had. I would definitely recommend this store and these boots for anyone looking for a quality boot that is comfortable and will last you a long time.<//text>

Jessie and crew are amazing! From The very start the customer service was incredible. Their recommendations were spot on. After my purchase they mentioned monthly inspection and oiling of my work boots to keep them in the best shape possible since I wear them everyday. My work boots are not just attire but integral part of my PPE ( personal protective equipment) they make sure my boots are the best possible.<//text>

People are lazy. They don’t tell you about any of the repairs they can do unless you ask and even then they keep it very vague.<//review>

<Review>I went in and was very specific about what type of shoe I needed for the work I do. I explained I needed a combat syle shoe for the security/investigative work I do. Told the guy I need a shoe that can handle all sorts of terrain and obsticles. All he heard was security and lead me towards a shoe he claims all guards get and love. It was a basic shoe, not water proof and didn't really jump out at my. I decided to take his word after I looked at a few other pairs and he claimed the one he pointed out would be best.

The shoes tread wore down after 2 weeks of working and didn't have the grip I needed for being in the woods/forest areas. I was slipping all over and water and dirt filled my shoes. Highly dissapointing that this sales person couldn't listen to the customer properly to get the right shoe. For the basic lazy security guard this shoe would probably work just fine but that's not what I described.

I highly recommend going to the redwing store on Euclid in Anaheim. Not only was I given great service and attention to detail but  David Starks brought out the catalog of all shoes and made recommendations based off what I desired and needed and not off of what everyone else buys. I highly recommend taking the extra drive to the Anaheim location where you get a representative that cares about thier customers satisfaction and needs.</Review>< userid>

Too sweet and no flavor. Come here if you need to get diabetes. Zero effort in flavor, just a bunch of sugar thrown into the cake. Low quality, low skill, zero effort.<//text>

The Boston cream pie and cookies here are phenomenal! The iced lattes are quite tasty as well! And the service is on point! 👍🏼🙂</Review>

Hands down best bakery in Corona.

However, not the best quality. But for the price, it's very much worth it. Super cheap compared to most places and super good.</Text>

Great bakery! I've been here a few times and have loved everything I've gotten. They are literally the best bakery I have ever been to. Along with the amazing desserts, they also have amazing prices. As far as bakeries go, their prices are inexpensive. I tell everyone about the place! If it weren't for the calories, I would come here all the time.</text>

<Text>Oh my. This is the best bakery I have been to in many years. The pastry creme in the large eclair was truly delicious. My wife had a Napoleon with that same pastry creme and almond. I also had an apricot bar with such a rich apricot filling. This was our first visit but will not be the last. The choices of pastries is amazing.  You must visit this place.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Beautiful assortment of pastries and cakes hard to find any in one place: European, Middle Eastern, and American. They have some I see infrequently..like 5 flavors of Turkish Delight!.  Several hot coffee drinks also available, and a bistro type setting inside.  Prices are very reasonable. Strongly suggest to come here .</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dccfa0b7b398a3:0xb20e45b3059166dc<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great new bakery that carries european and middle eastern pastries and cakes. The cakes are beautiful and prices are very reasonable. Employees very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is very cozy and elegant, with some soft chairs and tables to enjoy some sweets with freshly made coffee. I purchased $30 worth of sweets to try a little bit of everything and wasn't disappointed. I loved the cookies and my favorite was the chocolate truffle cheese cake. Definitely will go back and order some fruit tarts for parties.< /review>

<Review>I was craving for some pastries for no reason today.  Found this place when I searched 10 miles radius from my house on Google Map.  Yes, I do this all the time 🍰!  Drove 8 miles to get there, and, boy, was I glad I did.  This place just opened about a month ago.  It’s clean and welcoming.  I bought 6 pieces of pastries and croissants to take home with.  The lady owner packed them in a beautiful white box finished with some streamer ties; really presentable.  I knew instantly their pastries would not disappoint.  And yes, I was right.  I have finished 2 pieces out of 4, both are great.  I will most definitely come back to try out the rest of them.  Lots to choose from, and most reasonable prices.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>Wonderful little gem in Corona. While sitting in the Green River traffic, I highly recommend going to grab a morning pastry and cup of coffee. Inside is super cute, and all there bakery items are displayed beautifully. I've been here a few times to pick up some random treats. You can pick out a bunch of different items to sample them, because believe me it's hard to just choose one! Got a box filled with all sorts of goodie for my husbands bday: chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, chocolate cream pie, kalua cheesecake, chocolate covered strawberries, key lime tart. Friendly staff as well, always have a smile :)</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

It seems like a friendly family run operation. A refreshing change from big garden centers and high end nurseries. Check out the "secret"  mini greenhouse behind the main building. It usually has some new and interesting houseplants. Just picked up this Alligator Fern today.<//text>

I had a blast exploring their grounds and taking photos of all the unique flowers and plants in their facility! I felt as if I was in a botanical garden, except you can buy the plants if you like them. Despite there being a huge variety of plants, everything in the facility looked very well-maintained and vibrant!< /text>< Pictures>

Pros:  Convenient neighborhood location.

Cons:
Disinterested, dismissive and unmotivated staff who do not offer assistance and in fact act as if they are being imposed upon when approached.

Disorganized layout.

Limited inventory of plants, many of which appear to be dried out/uncared for.

Familiarity with plants recommended - containers typically lack clear labeling and plant information tags.

Upon exiting we were asked if we had been able to find everything we were looking for as it had been observed that we had spent quite a while shopping.

This review should answer that question...</text>

It was nice the fact that they had the plants that I had been looking for.  For such a long time.
The people are great.
Very helpful.  And since they have big long trees, they even help you with putting them in ur vehicle.<//text>< user_id>

I’ve been going there since 1980. Lots of help very knowledgeable.  Selection is incredible. Everytime I’ve gone somewhere else I’ve been disappointed.  I’ve introduced so many friends to them. It’s fun to go with friends they end up becoming customers too.</Text>

<Review>Yes I've been going to this place since the 1980s it's a family-owned business for like 70 years. I have fruit trees that are at least 10 or more years old that I got thereI just got a peach tree today they're always extremely helpful and letting me know how to plant it and how to take care of it.</Review>< GmapID>

The elderly man that owns this nursery is knowledgeable and kind. The young men that assist and do the stocking, etc., don’t have a grasp of common flowers and plants. I asked about a specific flower this nursery has sold for over 20 years and was told it was in and available. When I arrived, they didn’t have this flower but one said it would arrive the following week. It didn’t. Came in to the nursery & all of the male employees had no idea what I was talking about. The one I spoke with alone literally turned around & walked away. No words. I spent around eighty dollars a few weeks ago and all flowers are now dead (no refund policy for any reason). I’ve been gardening for over 30 years & know how to plant and water, even in the extreme heat. The owner needs to hire people that know common flowers and plants & can communicate orally with customers.<//Review>

<review>Just went today for the first time and fell in love with the variety and atmosphere. There are butterflies and hummingbirds everywhere and so much to see, the lot is very big, the plants are of excellent quality and are well taken care of for a good price, the service is great as well. Will definitely be coming back!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd2c2b85a63abf:0xa5354ede66f011da</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>This place is great!  My only change would be that it would be helpful to have more plants labeled because sometimes it is hard to know what you are looking at and dont want to bother the employees constantly. They are always helpful though.<//Review>< Rate>

<Text>Came in for the first time today, I have Driven by this nursery for the last 40 years finally stopped in looking for a treat no tree driven by this nursery for the last 40 years finally stopped in looking for a tree. After waiting in line for my turn,The old man running the place had no time for me. I wanted to ask where a specific tree was, but because I didn’t have and items in my hand, he literally turned to the next customer and ignored me asking him where to find what I was looking for. Hey dummy, you sold $12 worth of tomato plants sure, but you lost a big sale of at least 2 box trees because of your rudeness. I won’t be back. Trees looked sick to me anyway when I walked around. Probably saved me a bad purchase...<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dd2c2b85a63abf:0xa5354ede66f011da<//gmap_id><user_id>102677129965443491518< /user_id><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

Nice restaurant, not really expensive. Food is great. The only disadvantage is it's closed at 9pm, but they don't force you to leave. Service is really great. I ordered Mediterranean fish special. Not greasy, just right.< /text>

The entire staff was very friendly and made us feel amazing. And above all, everything edible that hit the table was made PERFECTLY!

We haven't patronized C'Era Una Volta for over a decade, for good reason. We have high expectations with Italian food and unfortunately they did not improve with time.    The best part of the meal was probably the bread, served with a warm, mustardy aioli that was both smooth and pungent, creamy but not spicy.  The beet salad was so uninspiring, we could have done better putting a few pkgs from Trader Joes in a bowl and assembling something ourselves. Our daughter's kids' sausage pizza was served with mushrooms (wasn't mentioned on the menu), husband's melanzane Parmigiana was decent, but my Tagliolini alla Senese was a let-down. There was a giant clump of uncooked, unseparated noodles, and the sauce was supposed to be a chianti beef sauce but all I could get was tons of herbaceousness from a heavy hand (I forgot if it was thyme or rosemary, it wasn't pleasant). The service was very lackluster (took a while to take our order, arms reaching across the table instead of going around to serve/clear, no one checked on us after our main courses were delivered). I truly wish they would improve because I would throw my money at a good Italian reataurant without a second thought (yes, we've been to Italy, from Roma up to Venezia) but it isn't this place.< /Text>

After many years of curiosity about this restaurant, we finally walked in to celebrate our 8 year anniversary. Everyone was genuinely friendly, and respectfully answered all our questions. The food and wine were delicious! I could tell you all we had, but I suggest to go and check it out for yourself (I will come back and add the dishes...). I'm very happy we chose C'Era Una Volta for our special day.< /text>

Wonderful romantic place to dine with that special someone, whether it be adult daughter, significant other, mother or others. New, Italian decor, with upstairs & outdoor seating for warm weather. The owner remembered me & so did the hostess; Gigi the waitress was friendly & attentive. There's a bar in the waiting area and another on the restaurant floor. Bottles of wine started at $30. My bill for 3 was $135.00 with wine.<//Review>

We didn't have reservations but once seated our waiter was very knowledgeable & informative. Unfortunately they forgot our salads & served us our entrees first. We almost done when they finally arrived. We were compensated with a dessert. Lasagna was very good. Tiramisu was ok.</text>

Very nice service. Pleasant place but the shrimp were seriously overcooked. Scallops were good. Just had an appetizer there, not worth the bother of a complaint. Would go again with a group because they were wonderfully accommodating and other dishes may well be better; but caution advised: some other people also had problems with some of what they ordered. However, when they complained, the response was gracious and the items were changed out.<//text>

The Branzino is among the best you will find anywhere.
The eggplant Parmigiana rich but not fried or buried in cheese.
The pastas are all handmade and a true delight. You can't miss.
I like the Spinach Ravioli in Pesto sauce.</Review>< Pictures>

This is an outstanding place. Family friendly, yet super service and outstanding food. We were there w friends and the kids acted up a little. We were talking intently and staff diverted them. Over the top.  Also, we picked out a wine and when we were deciding on another, we asked for a recommendation. Their recommendation was better than our choice. We'll be back!< /Review>

<review>We thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant as a great addition to our area! (2 mins from our home)!  The owners greeted us at our table, our server was excellent and the food and wine where fantastic!  By far my favorite part was the decor! Wow!! I loved all the detail and custom barn wood design that was so warm and welcoming. We will for sure be bringing many friends & family to this new dining experience!</review>< Name>

Service was very attentive Diana our waitress was kind and sweet. The one of the owners Cheryl came to our table to greet us.

My only recommendation to the owners is a bit more sauce on the pasta. Also rather than bringing out the pasta first on a separate plate and then the eggplant parmesan and side salad on another, I would have preferred the side salad on a separate plate or all three on one large plate.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>We were told our wait would be 20 minutes,  it was closer to 30. Waited for at least 10 to even see our waitress, asked what type of water we wanted, then went to have an agrument with the hostess,  in front of everyone & then walked away with out coming back to take our order.... another 10 no water still , she comes back to take our order to only walk away again... Eventually she comes back another 10 minutes later.... we're both upset at this point.... she's basically dismissive of it. It seems at least 1/2 the people there were given horrible serve, the place isn't that big, you could tell the hostess was trying to put "fires".  Two large groups left because they got tried of waiting for their waiter.  The food was good, though the "freshly" bakes cookies were burnt. They took cookies from jar & put them in the oven to claim fresh, to explain the 15 minutes wait for my cookies & dessert wine. Won't be back< /review>< Pictures>

I usually don't go to pricier places but was walking past with my boyfriend and we decided to treat ourselves. Despite the fact that we were dressed quite casually, we were treated like royalty by the wait staff. They are very friendly and helpful here, and made some great recommendations on the menu. The food and wine were both very good, and I would definitely go back to this place again. The atmosphere was also very nice as the noise level was not high.< /Text>

<Review>I simply believe this is a singular space for a meal in Alameda.  Every new guest of mine has dinner here, with plenty of repeats.  Cheryl, Rudi and Team make it thoughtless for me when I want great food and personal service.  If you want superior food, wander down the courtyard by the post sub-station and love awaits.  Always.

Bad waiter service, ignored my calls, spent a lot of time, full conversation with a particular table, never brought additional requested bread nor came by for the take out order. The young female assistant was fantastic saved the day, I compensated her well personally. Food, wine and bread were good.</text>

I came in at lunchtime, and they have a limited menu, if you come in early, like I did. I had the porcini panini, and it was delicious. It also came with a side salad that had a mustard-like dressing. I also had the pompelmo (grapefruit) San Pellegrino soda, but their other flavors are also available. I plan on going back for dinner, which starts at 4pm local time. My server was very friendly, which is always appreciated. I was also given the option to either sit inside or on the patio, and since it's a nice day, I sat outside. The parking is always challenging, but that is through no fault of the establishment. I recommend C'Era Una Volta.< /text>

The service was not great,  we had to ask for bread and water for our table.  The brie appetizer was good but my panini was mostly bread with very little filling and it lacked flavour.  My husband enjoyed his italian sausage but the pasta my parents had was lack luster.  Overall it was fine,  but not worth the money.< /review>

Wait staff, preparation, ambiance were all spot on. Our waiter was attentive and caring. I was a bit overwhelmed by the wine list and asked for help with a huge selection of Italian and other European reds. So our waiter called in the de facto wine steward. That person asked a couple of simple questions, made her recommendation and nailed it.
Gluten free options for my dining partner, the Tortelloni Ai Porcini for me.
As the place filled up we never felt rushed. Our waiter constantly reminded us through dinner, wine, dessert and coffee to "take our time."

On top of everything else, there was a medical emergency. Other diners stepped in to care for a person that had passed out and hit the floor*. Seeing that the person was being cared for, staff seemed to monitor the situation but did not attempt to rush in and "direct traffic" unnecessarily.

*The diner that lost consciousness was helped back into their chair, city paramedics were called, came and attended and took the diner out on a gurney. Throughout, staff kept the rest of us informed and offered a calm that was well appreciated.</Review>< Pictures>

Wonderful Italian restaurant, delicious food and good servers. The cacciatore was very absolutely  great with a tasty tomato sauce, olives and al dente vegetables. Charming interior. Definitely going back.<//Text>

<Text>This place is so sad.
Needs lots of fixing up, more donations done 😞 better food and sleeping area's for people.
Proper bathrooms too.
I hope the country figure out what needs to be done for the homeless, if they do decide to fix it up i would suggest drug testing everyone. And make it more of a family shelter...then maybe build a men's area.
And add a mini church.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Time>1551300644831</Time><Rating>2<//Rating><text>My fiance and i were passing through and hungry but didn't need shelter at the time because we have a car. Was warmly welcomed in for dinner and turned away when we sat down due to not staying the night in the shelter. Very disappointing due to the fact that  to be "Christian" is to be "Christ like ". Jesus wouldnt have turned down anyone who is hungry whether they were staying or just coming through because they were hungry. This is the second shelter we have stopped at on our road trip that has turned us down for something. Next day we stopped for sack of lunch and was turned down while everyone else was welcomed in having a hot lunch. We were handed four fiber one bars and a loaf of sourdough bread. Very thankful for anything !! Not complaining about that but as Christians and a Christian ministry shouldn't we be serving Christ and not the people or for ourselves ?? Gods word is posted all over the walls in the building talking about how to walk in Gods word and to be Christ like but yet we have Servants of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ turning people down for food ??? There is seriously something wrong with this picture when this place receives plenty of donations to support feeding the hungry and giving them shelter. Out of all those who we spoke with in that building there was only one man with his heart and mind in the right place and he said to us there was plenty of food and he would be wrong to turn us down if we are hungry. He even told us to sit down and enjoy a meal...just as Jesus would have. May God Bless that man and give him his own ministry for the homeless so it is done the way Jesus would want it done.

Mike is one of kindest people in this town! He has such a beautiful vision for people! I took my cash mob in to mob his thrift store once. The gratitude we felt is something that will warm my heart for a lifetime! He would help an injured fly if he could! Thank you Mike Justice!</text>

Someone tried to charge almond milk that added to my coffee. And when I was told that as a customer I can’t tell her that what to do about almond milk extra charge. The barista was arguing with me with no reason at all. I have been coming to this Starbucks for last 7 years and it was the worst experience this evening. There are all great guys working there I saw the barista first time yesterday and I felt like I was their beg my coffee not buying. Bad experience.< /text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>This Starbucks is tiny and so usually overcrowded, but I always get good service. Tonight was exceptional, though. Why? One word - Arby! Best. Barista. Ever. If you don't know what you what or think you want to try something new, he'll give you a mini "coffee interview" to find out what kind of stuff you like & then mix you up something.

While it IS pretty crowded, most people pick up and go, so if a power outlet is not required for your peaceful existence at Starbucks, you can still set up shop for a few hours. The tables next to outlets are few and usually full when I have come in.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Coffee was really good. Location is convenient.  It's a little small, so when alot of people are there it's not the most comfortable environment.</review>

I've been patronizing this Starbucks for over a year and.my experience has been going down hill. My mobile orders are either wrong, late, or not to my liking . I go at least 3 times a week and the customer service is declining... fast!
My order today wasn't made right because I order the same coffee the same way for the last the three years. So yeah, I'm not pleased at all!<//review>

I walked to a 565 store number Starbucks only to learn that the sign and internet was wrong. I experienced an awful display from two associates at that location. It was a few customers waiting for an opportunity to ask what time did they open and that the sign was wrong. A female associate said we know! Just awful</text>

<resp>None<//resp><review>I made an order and presented a $50 bill. My cashier ask the cashier next to her could he break the $50 bill. The young man quickly said no and kept going and doing what he was doing. I gladly ran out to the car, got my credit card came back in to pay and noticed the same young man making change for another customers $50 bill. When I asked him what was the difference between my $50 bill and the other customers $50 bill he had no answer except for I didn't know I had change.
This was pure nonsense as he had just stepped into work with a full cash drawer. After contacting the manager she confirmed his door was full and tryed to answer by saying we do not give change for $50 bills. So my question is still why was my $50 bill different than the ladies $50 bill. Oh... did I mention that I'm black and the other customer was a nice Caucasian lady? so once again we're faced with nonsense that didn't have to happen and didn't have to make me think race had anything to do with it. Albeit, it's certainly felt like that. The manager did not know what to do or say but after I told her I was a Google reviewer she quickly asked to pay for my coffee. Oh well, another day Living in this beautiful country.</review>< userid>

<text>The baristas at this location are SO NICE. This Starbucks is my neighborhood coffeeshop, so I come here a lot to study. I know at least 2 of the baristas by face (would be name, except I'm so terrible with names and they don't always have nametags-- shoutout to the girl who calls me honeybun, she's the sweetest ever). Drinks are always great, and they're wonderful about replacing them if I ever don't like one. I'm usually not one for chain coffeeshops (I really like independent neighborhood coffeeshops), but this feels like an extension of home for me. I'm going to be sad when I move down to San Diego and won't be able to come here every week. 😢</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The mobile order printer ran out of paper. But Isaac let us know, and made the order immediately. Was in a rush, and the line was wicked long, so it really great to know that it was a priority that the mistake of the printer was accounted for.

As a side note, the paper supplier should have a warning on the label paper letting the user know it’s running low.< /text>

<Text>Greatest Starbucks I have ever been too.  Kamren Contreras always makes my drinks and he is so friendly and always happy.  He brightens my day, all the time.  Fast service, and calls me by name.  Makes me feel good that in this busy, bustling world, some people still have that Honesty and take the time to always greet a customer, no matter how busy he is. I hope Starbucks recognizes him and hires more like him.  Greatest place for Coffee and a light snack everyday!!!! Keep it up Kamren! You are doing it.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

Guy who took my order was pleasant, short girl on hot/cold bar made my drink wrong 3 times, I just gave up. As someone who used to work for Starbucks I know my drink and how it is supposed to taste, this place needs serious help learning how to BUILD THE DRINK.  Thank goodness I just was passing through on business and don't actually live here, the Starbucks on Newbury Park should hold a training course he<//Text>

Update: they've redone the interior seating & it's a great improvement!

It's just laid out poorly. The outdoor seating faces the busy Vons parking lot,  and the umbrellas do little to protect from the glare of the sun.  This is the least comfortable Starbucks I've ever been to.

A inside, the seating is also poorly laid out. In all fairness, they've had to work with a small space...however, the workers are generally friendly and polite.</review>

Awesome store. Good amount of outlets/plugs by seats as well as bar table seating across the window walls. Restrooms require a pin code. Staff are super friendly.< /Text>

Good service, fast with orders. Nice place to sit in doors or outdoors. The inside is a little tight. Has handicap accessible ramps on both sides.</review>

<text>There's nothing wrong with this Starbucks. It's just like any other Starbucks. However there are usually a few gangster looking dudes walking around the parking lot outside asking people for cash so they can get a drink. Stay the hell away if you dont want your car keyed.<//text>< Pictures>

Typical Starbucks. Enjoyed my frappucino & sandwich. Staff was truly friendly & helpful. I'd go back to this location. However parking can be a bit difficult becuz there's Vallarta Mkt to one side of the lot & Chase bank next door.</text>

This place is easy to get into Even if you are handicapped. There was a long line and the coffee was a bit sour. I was also not happy with the dirty bathroom. I think I'll stick to Dunkin Donuts.<//Text>

I placed a mobile order and when I got there and asked for it the barista answered rudely that she didn't know. Then walked away and when she came back said it didn't print out. It wouldn't have bothered me so much except she made no effort to apologize and she had a bad attitude the entire time.< /Review>

Wifi didn't work when I was there and we really needed it. Not like that's a deadly sin or anything. Just a slight inconvenience. Other than that it was a Starbucks.<//Text>

I have been a long time client of his Starbucks location, until a few weeks ago  when I was ordering and one of the baristas was awfully rude to me.  I guess she was having a bad day and decided to take it out on me. She was not listening to my order so she got the size of the cup wrong.   I said sorry but I asked for a Venti cup please. She immediately threw the cup behind her in a very dramatic way and looked at me mad.
There was a huge line behind and I imagine they all saw this, I was so embarrassed. I came back to my office and sent out an email to corporate about the incident. Until this day I have not heard back from them.</Review>
