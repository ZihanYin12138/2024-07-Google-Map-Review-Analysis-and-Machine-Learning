<time>1600484034820</time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>This is by far the best veterinary hospital I have encountered. I absolutely love the staff there and Dr. Wooden. I have (had :(....) Three rescue dogs that are very iffy with people. The staff that work here are all so compassionate and take the time to work with my rescue dogs and all their issues. I feel comfortable with my dogs in their hands, which is unusual for me. Dr Wooden is amazing!! He has a compassionate loving heart for my animals, Is brilliant and knowledgeable, and takes the time to explain things to me about my pets. The wonderful thing is that you can tell he really cares about my animals and their well-being. I can't say enough good things about this vet and how comfortable they have made me, I wouldn't take my pets anywhere else at this point. I had to put my oldest down the other day here, and Dr Wooden and the staff were so compassionate and caring towards not only my animals, but me. The way my dog left this Earth was gentle and loving. I can't say enough how amazing this vet hospital is. On a side note, They other veterinarians that work there are amazing as well. One even took the time to come out and comfort me after I put my dog down and sit with me in the parking lot while I cried. having compassion and a golden heart like this isn't something that you can learn in school, these people are just special that work there. Thank you San Juan veterinary hospital for your compassionate caring hearts ❤️< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

My family has been bringing our pets here for over 15 years. The prices are getting outrageous and trying to get an appointment that isn't a week out can be difficult. I need to get my new kitten spayed and they want to charge me almost $400. Other vets around here are charging half that price (I've been making calls) and community clinics charge $65 to $100. Not sure how this vet can justify charging more than everyone else including non profits. May need to find a new vet soon. I've been disappointed too many times lately.<//text>

The staff was wonderful. Had a 15 year old dog who wasn't getting out of bed. We thought it was that time. We wanted more time with our dog. The vet gave him a shot of steroids and said If we don't see an improvement in a few days it was probably time to think about putting him down. Well the shot worked. Buddy was up and walking the next day. The vet gave us a few more weeks with our wonderful dog (Buddy).< /Text>

My family have brought our three dogs here since I was a little girl. They are awesome vets and did above and beyond to take care of our dogs whenever we needed anything. Sadly our three dogs have all passed now. And I'm bring my new puppy in there. And they are just amazing. I would recommend the San Juan veterinary hospital over any other veterinary hospital in a heart beat. They are an awesome group of people! Thank you!!< /text>

<Text>I recently had to put my 15 year old dog down and was a total wreck. Dr H was amazing!!! Not only did she hold my hand and give me incredibly comforting words to hold onto, she actually cried with me on the floor while I said goodbye and fell apart. I can never express how grateful I've been for the years of honest care that we've experienced at this office. No matter where I live I will always come here.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I highly recommend SJVC. They are all about animal care. The service provided is truly based on animal need and not the income it produces for the clinic (like Banfield or VCA). Their costs are reasonable and honestly, I am proud to support a business and staff that care as much about my animals as I do!< /review>< pics>

The care and personal connection the vets and office staff have with their clients is hands down the best in the area. I've been taking my various pets to Dr Buntrock for the past 35 years. You won't find better care for your pets anywhere else in the area.</Text>

Our cats have been going to San Juan Veterinary all their lives. Our male lived to 18 (they saved him at 12 years of age by referring him to a specialist) and our two remaining cats are 16 going on 17 October 2013 and 3 years of age. The technicians and doctors are great!</review>

These doctors are the best.  It's always a long wait, but they spend time with you and your pet.  I have been taking my animals here for over 10 years.< /Review>

<Time>1446496991928< /Time><Rate>1</Rate><text>My dog had an elective surgery 3 days ago and yesterday she chewed some stitches off.  I was surprised they didn't tell me she HAD to wear a cone when I picked her up but they didn't even bring one up and when I asked they said she had been good and not bothering with it so I left as I figured they knew best.  Today I took her back because of the stitches and when vet came in I said I was surprised they didn't tell me she had to have a cone when we picked her up and he immediately was defensive and rude said he heard the girl tell me about cone but when I explained you heard me ask if she needed a cone he just cut me off. I was shocked by his defensiveness and how in professional he was and said so and he was even mor out off so I said I was going to report him.  I walked out and said I would take my business of 14 years elsewhere.  Vets response was in not doing this for free and my response was who asked you to.  I never spoke of money, paying or not paying. Shocked to be treated so rudely< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Brandon made this year’s taxes a breeze. I was nervous about filing, so I reached out and I couldn’t be happier with the service, speed, and knowledge that him and his team were able to provide. I plan on doing my taxes with them every year from now on and regret not finding them sooner!< /review>

<text>It's a perfectly good snack stop for going on a short ride or long ride like we did. Decent selection and there were decent prices and they had various items. Definitely they were better than your average gas station unless it's a big one. But seems like a better place to go to if you don't need gas.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2d7d127ee2c6f:0x5eaa049c75511196</GmapID></record>

This snack stop is located in the West Covina Plaza. I would like to come here to buy chips, beverages, sodas or even candies.< /Text>

The place offers some great Thai food! Tried the Spicy Fried rice with Crispy Rolls and Thai tea. And it was simply delicious! Definitely going there again!</review>

One of my favorite places to go for dinner or lunch (buffet style but food is always fresh). Reasonable prices, free delivery, staff is always friendly. Close to home. What's not to like?< /Text>

This experience is above and beyond what you would expect from any decent steakhouse but this is not a decent steakhouse this is THE steakhouse this is the standard that classic steak houses should be measured. Great experience old school from white table cloth and red tufted leather booths the experience here is always excellent.

Chris and Ting are some of the best owners I've had the pleasure of talking with. They truly want their patrons to enjoy food, and boy will you! Pre-Covid, it was nice to be able to sit inside and see where the food comes from, unlike most larger restaurants.

Small spot tucked away in a shopping center, off of Santo Rd almost unnoticed right next to a laundromat.

Portions are ample enough to satisfy your appetite and you'll be wowed by the taste. Food and location feel like you're having food from your mom... if she made Thai. The Drunken Noodles, are amazing and the Pumpkin Curry is a must! Just ask Chris or Ting what they like and I'm sure they will steer you in the right direction.

Currently, everything is only for take out/delivery due to current conditions. I highly recommend calling your order in and picking it up to help support our local businesses and to meet the people here. Ordering from delivery services robs these places of needed income, and right now everyone can use the help.

I truly recommend this place if you're looking for good homemade style Thai food from a place that's just around the corner.</Text>

Consistantly great food! we love supporting this small business almost weekly because they are very professional. Every single dish we’ve ordered from their menu tasted authentic and has generous portions. We’ve had takeout with many friends and every time they are overly impressed and excited to learn about Lilac Thai. Their website makes it very easy to order and pay online for takeout giving you text updates during the process, you will not be disappointed!</text>

<Date>1584120484222<//Date><text>This Thai place is definitely a mop and pop’s place. Only has 5 tables in a small cute place in Tierrasanta.

Their food is the bomb. Authentic Thai food at its best. You can adjust the spice level according to your taste. We ordered drunken chicken noodle and green papaya salad and I repeat they were delicious.

Not pictured, we ordered a dish in peanut sauce and that was also amazing along with the chicken fried rice.

The owners are very friendly. The husband serves and waits on the tables while the wife cooks and manages the kitchen. Lovely couple.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Was seating and served by a man named Kriss. He was very attentive, helpful to our questions about some of the items on the menu even making delicious recommendations (mango curry with chicken and shrimp), and very professional. Food was served in a timely manner. The place was clean and had a cozy atmosphere perfect for my date night. Would recommend and can't wait to go again!< /text>

Made a phone order here of the Drunken Noodles combination meats (pork, beef, shrimp, and chicken breast) with a 6 of 10 for spice. This was amazing! Food was very fresh, packaged so no sauces would drip from the container, and done reasonably quickly. Kind service too.</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Worst restaurant experience of my life, New to the neighborhood so I wanted to try out some new food, Saw what looked like a cozy tiny Thai spot, sat down and placed my order, in the middle of placing my order the server/waiter ignores me to take a phone call which shouldav been the first red flag, after my order, the waiter/server started hassling me for money without even starting my food. Their menu has no pictures of any of their meals so you have no clue what you’re ordering, I told the server that I’d like to pay after I get my meal and he actually threatened me “you sure you want us cooking your food without paying first”, second red flag, finally got my food, so I payed and even tipped the server despite him being rude and threatening, as soon as I paid the server/waiter told me to leave and never comeback
Not the best way to treat paying customers

On top of everything the food was mediocre (orange chicken and fried rice was soggy and bland) guess he wasn’t kidding about them cooking your food without you paying upfront</text>< Pics>

{'time': 1547076755220, 'text': 'Well, sounds like your experience is told a bit different than the repeat customers in the next booth over. They were quite surprised by your demeanor, the wife (a navy shore patrol person) said she was on "ready" because her and her husband were unsure what your next move might be. As an owner and having been in the customer service business over 30 years I had never heard someone with quite the response you displayed, and although it is absolutely my job and focus to make certain every customer has an awesome experience, it is also necessary to protect my other customers and staff from apparent danger. Your rendition is quite inaccurate, as you actually did tip, then asked for it back, which I promptly returned and have proof of the facts.'}</Response>

<rating>5</rating><text>AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!!! I originally ordered through Grub Hub ( big mistake). When for no reason Grub Hub cancels my order. I’m at work and cannot just run out to get my food hence the reason for ordering through Them. Then to my amazement I get a phone call from Kriss. After explaining my situation he offered to bring me my meal without hesitation. I’m truly thankful that people like this still exist in the world. And the food was delicious!!!!! Thank you again Lilac Thai Kithchen and Kris’s!!!!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The best Thai food I’ve EVER had! It definitely takes awhile for them to cook the food but it’s sooooo worth the wait! I feel spoiled because this is the only Thai restaurant in America that I like!<//Review>

Their food is delicious! It was our first time here and we ordered the Spicy Fried Rice and Chicken Pad Thai; it was fresh with amazing flavor! My favorite part was their level of spicy is 100% accurate. I always order my food at 8/10 spicy and their food was super spicy, just the way I wanted it :-) Lilac Thai Kitchen is definitely going to be our go-to for authentic Thai food!

Try them out! They're awesome!

(Huge bonus, they have amazing customer service)!

Edited to add that their thai iced tea is so freaking yummy!

Update: each and every time I order, their chicken Pad Thai is perfectly sauced and tastes amazing! I Iove adding prik nam pla to make it even spicier!
Consistently delicious!!!!!

I think this place has one of the best Bun Bo Hue dishes in San Francisco. If you come here, you should try that. Other than that, everything else I've tried is not really my taste.
And they also accept credit card so that's a plus.<//Review>

Favourite is #10 (Satay Beef with coconut milk). Huge portion. Delicious. Fast service. Messy food. Great prices. I also like #128 (Sweet Caramel) for the dessert.< /review>

<text>They used to have the best priced bang for your buck Bahn Mi from City College to State. A great sandwich to grab and run. Been coming here half a decade and was a great student budgeted meal.  Unfortunately in these last 2 years seen these tasty sandwiches go to almost twice the price for half the meat. Service is nice. Food turnover fast.
Maybe the price reflects a new overhead. Im not sure but either way bummed about the changes.
Still a good option when convenient but I won’t be going out of my way for it anymore.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I ordered a seafood noodle soup with extra vegetables, and they charged me two more dollars for a piece of bok choy and broccoli and hardly any seafood. . . Total of $15. Not worth it.</Review>

I love this place. And I love that it is 5 minutes away from my house. Their beef stew is to die for! The prices here are also affordable and the staff are super sweet.</Text>

Solid neighborhood place, always busy, super nice staff, and terrific food. Stand outs are sandwiches (pork, tofu), spring rolls (fried or fresh), seafood & pork pancake, and of course the Pho. High quality but inexpensive. Been many times never a bad meal.< /Review>

Looks great if you eat meat! Unfortunatly the veggie dishes were dull tasting. The service is fast so if you're looking for a fast suit down grub this place is a good choice.</Review>

Food was pretty good but the service was bad. In addition to the poor service, the employees all seemed to be depressed. Everytime I or my friends asked for something, the employees reacted like we were bothering them. We all got a very weird feeling from the employees. Won't go back because there are to many Vietnamese restaurants to go to.< /Text>

Food and prices are ok,  but as soon as you walk into the door, you feel you are in a funeral. All the servers looked so miserable, I believe they just want customers NOT to show up. Yes you read it right. There is no joy in seeing their customers walking in. They are just there to get a paycheck. I asked for water 3 times and the lady just kept on going to the back to chat with her coworkers, which were on their phones most of the time. There is no sense of urgency, customer service or willingness to keep their customers coming back. I asked for the check and the lady came, put it on the table without even looking at us, and walked away.
If you want an ok food and prices, go for it, otherwise just go to a funeral to see the same long faces you will get at this place. Funny how they break down the recommended tip at the bottom of the receipt like they deserve one.</Text>

<Text>My daughter was saying she wanted Pho and that she and her friends went to a place on Ocean.  I found this place on google maps, but when we go here, she said this wasn't the place she went with her friends.  It was already pretty late so we got a table, at first it was less than half full.  They bring tea right away.  We ordered our food, my daughter got Pho, but I got the duck and bamboo noodle soup.  She said the Pho was ok and it smelled really good (actually when you walk in you smell the Pho broth).  The bamboo in my soup isn't your typical slice you get out of a can that many Chinese restaurants server.  I think they needed to cook the bamboo a little more, some was very chewy.  They serve a vinegar ginger sauce for the duck (they serve the duck with bones so watch out).  I wish the broth was a bit richer.

Overall the place is solid, service isn't too great, you order, you get your food, then you flag them down for the check.  My daughter never got her glass of water she request and she gave up and just drank tea instead.

About 8:30pm the place filled up quickly.  When we walked to our car, there was many people double parking, waiting for spaces.

I'll be back to try their other dish, but I'll increase my star points then.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Don't get dry shrimp and pork noodle.  Not worth the money.  Hot and sour catfish is delicous.  The 5 spice chicken was skimppy portion but delicious.  Order the entree instead. Service was fast.  Tea included.<//Review>

Pretty busy on weekends but service is quick. Pho is pretty good but they're pretty stingy with the Bahn mi (sandwiches) its mostly bread and barely meat/filling. There is a credit card minimum I believe it's $15.<//text>

My wife and I love this place. This was our regular spot to eat after work. Friendly and quick staff, good pricing, excellent flavors. If we hadn't moved, we'd still be eating here 2-3 times a week.< /review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Ordered two fruit juices from the place while I was eating there. At the time I was on a sugar free diet and when I received the drinks I asked the waitress if there was sugar in the drink, she replied by saying "I don't know, I don't make the drinks" and proceeded to summon a guy who may have been the owner. The guy/owner came to me and told me it was my fault I didn't specify that I didn't want sugar and when I asked him to remake he charged me double. Really bad service on their part, not to mention that two months prior I ate there and had a really bad stomachache for two days. The food is mediocre without a balance in ingredients. I would never go back there.< /text>< pics>

The pho offered here is very bland, even ramen noodles have more flavor. I am Vietnamese and the although Vietnamese people do run this restaurant, the food tastes very inauthentic and prepared lazily. Also, it is prepared more Hanoian (northern) style as opposed to Saigon (southern) style which tends to be significantly more bland.<//Text>

Pho is lack luster price is good. They charge 50cents for soup containers, leading to a huge amount of food waste. 15$ minimum charge on cc. Service is sub par. Seat yourself, pay at register.< /text>

<text>Ok so this place isn’t bad. Until this one time. Yes I love pho and who doesn’t. Let me just see if I can get some pho at 9:00 P.M. which is 30 minutes before it closes. NOPE. The place is full of people eating but the workers are probably too lazy to serve people anymore so they don’t have to clean up. Ok well let me go in and ask at least. NOPE. Flipped the sign to closed as soon as a i neared but it clearly hasn’t closed yet because there is still people eating in there. At least walked to the door and politely decline my service. NOPE. They just awkwardly stare from their counter to us at the door. It’s glass. Alright whatever I’ll just go to another one. I’m not going to lie, the food is great but this issue changed my whole perspective and people should know.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>There was a kid inside making a lot of noise with his skateboard and the TV was super loud on a cable show. This was first and last time I will eat at this place. The Aguas Fresca was good but not for the price of $5.00. The one at the market are cheaper and just as delicious WON'T BE RETURNING OR RECOMMENDING THIS PLACE.</Review><username>Silvia E.

<Text>The service is family friendly and the staff is all family itself, great new place for our Montebello community and I really hope they are shown all the love and support that they deserve to be successful. They treated us like family and I hope they get treated the same way from our Montebello residents. We  (party  of 8) went for Grandmother's birthday turning 91 and she had a joyful and memorable time, Peter was very attentive and they went as far as to bring the whole family out of the kitchen to sing to our Grandmother las mañanitas with a delicious cheesecake, All in all a great experience and everything you ask for in good service and good food.

The entire crew over at Spoke Easy is incredibly helpful and fun to work with. They know their stuff and they are very fair with their rates and repair lead times. Tip: if you really want to thank them for their services, they really enjoy IPA beers 😉 🍻</text>

Brian and Bryce are the best! Such a happy surprise when they called me and told me my new bike cranks were in!! Honestly, there was some miscommunication b/c it wasn’t clear that my bike cranks were ordered (they were backordered) BUT it was such a pleasant surprise!! I couldn’t even buy the cranks myself b/c they kept getting backordered lol...anyways!! I’m super fearful of covid and Bryce let me go straight up front so I didn’t have to wait in the line to get my cranks installed. He finished the job in < 1 hour on a beautiful Saturday 3:30-4:15pm. He even fixed my gears, now they’re shifting as smooth as silk (almost lol). They are so skilled and helpful here!! 100% the best bike shop I’ve been to!! I was riding in gg park < 1 hr after they fixed my bike. Thank you Bryce for making my Saturday so happy 😊😊😊</Text>

<Text>I live around the corner from Spoke Easy and could not have asked for a better LBS. I've been a customer for several years and in that time they've provided excellent maintenance services for my road and full suspension mountain bikes.

Cheers to Bryce, my new local hero. This type of humble, community business spirit just smacks you in the face these days. In short, if you live in the San Francisco Richmond, support this shop.

They’ve always been happy to talk through options with me too, which is awesome because I’ve learned a bunch from their team. If you just want to drop your bike and say “fix this”, they’re cool with that too.</Text>< response>

Great shop with a great staff. The folks here set me up with an awesome commuter bike and spent a good amount of time adjusting it to make sure it was the perfect fit.  We also bought our kid’s bike here and it was a great experience. I highly recommend buying a bike locally at this shop rather than online because if you need help with repairs, fitting etc they are totally there for you.  They are reliable and honest and will help you out!</text>

<Text>Thee guys were awesome. Super nice and friendly team. I know they are very busy and booked out so far in advance but they went out of their way to fit me in last minute to get my new bike together and get my steerer cut to my preference. Will definitely be coming back to get brakes and tune up for my old road bike. Thank you!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Great customer service, knowledgeable staff, a welcoming atmosphere and fair prices! Spoke Easy has built me a set of wheels, answered silly questions and made special orders for me. Highly recommend Spoke Easy to any and all.<//review>

I drop in without an appointment to have the handle bars on my rickety old '66 Schwinn Collegiate tightened, as I couldn't make it happen. They spend almost an hour with no parts, but lots of labor trying to tighten worn out parts. They finally get it done and the attempt to not charge me for it. I slipped them a bill anyhow and swore I'd be back the next time I needed work done. Nice shop, great guys!
Follow up: These guys stand behind their parts and labor, even for strange, repeated tube failures.  I can't recommend them enough.<//Review>

This is the best shop in the bay area! I have been brining my race bikes to Anson for over a year for everything from routine maintenance to crash repairs. He spends time to make sure everything is perfect, monitors all my components and does it all for a fair price. If you care about your bike this is the place to go!< /review>

Awesome neighborhood shop. The kind of place that remembers every bike they work on, local gearheads will trade for parts, and mom-in-law will come in asking for email help. Every time I've been I've received generous, patient, honest service. Moving from the neighborhood but will ride back for bike help for sure.< /Review>

Came back later in the afternoon that same day, with my boxed bike, and then was told it's actually $200 for assembly... Had to lug the box back home, and left very disappointed in the customer service at our neighborhood bike shop. I'll be taking my future business elsewhere.< /text>< pictures>

UPD: To be more specific. I came to the store, the associate took my order and started working on it. Then, the other customer walked in and that associate stopped fixing my tire and started talking to him instead of finishing what he already started. Their conversation lasted for 18 minutes while I was standing right there.</Text><gmap_id>0x8085871009911ac1:0xcaf96fe95cd2f86e</gmap_id>< user_name>

Took my bike here regarding about creaking noise. At first i thought it was the bottom bracket, but Mr. Anson later found out it was the chain that was creaking, not the bottom bracket. The Spoke Easy SF shop is my to go now, because of the quality of there service.<//review>

Looking for a status on orders is impossible.  I've sent emails to 2 different support emails and no response and no one picking up the phone.  It's going on 30 plus days with no help.</review>

This is an excellent place to buy soccer jerseys , I always do it there, I think it's the best store in the San Fernando Valley, but today it takes a disappointment, we called in the morning to place a number on the jersey of my Son and said it was free , and then the person who attends told us to pay, no matter the payment if not the bad attitude of wanting to charge something when you said it was free .</Text>

<text>2nd time I was there. If you don't have cash make sure you get some because it's cash only. The sazon that is used is like no other.  I live 20 minutes away (each way) and I still drive it because the taste is amazing.< /text><name>Maria E<//name>< user_id>

My first time! The coffee was very good and it’s nice to sit outside on the patio on Robertson and relax. The staff is very nice. Each cup of hot coffee is made just for you!< /text>

<review>This is the newest, beautiful cafe in the Blue Bottle family. This location is wonderful. It has a decent amount of seating indoors as well as seating out on the patio. They offer their delicious selection of toasts or English muffins plus the liege waffle and pastries. If you’ve never had the Blue Bottle waffle you are seriously missing out, I can’t recommend it enough.
The coffee here is fantastic. They take great care in preparing all of the beverages and they offer something for everyone. My go to is the cappuccino.
This is one of the first businesses to open in the newly renovated Robertson Plaza so it can be difficult to find at first but keep your eye out because it’s well worth the visit.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObRGBIF525LuU7l9Mlsx9I-0YRUVEP7Pi6USms=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgvG3iawxBPlmqCoaAYOHTQ5PEBF3cLHp-ReIw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><userid>114461320780902978970< /userid><rate>5</rate><gmapID>0x80c2bead0fd7b043:0x2c4589b868b9899a< /gmapID>< Resp>

<Review>Came here in the afternoon with some colleagues and my wife. The barista, Stephen (Steven?) was really awesome and made a perfect latte for my wife. Stephen was really kind, honest, and overall a superstar. Really the five stars is for him!<//Review>< pictures>

Blue Bottle is the most consistently excellent coffee, if you like a no-frills approach. Their biscuits are very similar to British scones and warmed up with butter/jam make for an absolutely yum time.</text>

Their Almond milk is the only Truly Natural one we could find and they do it justice! Amazing setting in a new building will give you the peace of mind to start your day right.

Think you've had great coffee? Then you haven't been to Blue Bottle. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but you don't have to be to know that you've gotten a GREAT cup here. Super friendly and educational baristas in a quaint and modern space. A bit expensive, but you ARE paying for quality. Put down your Starbucks now and give your taste buds the experience they crave!</Review>

I went here for an interview, and the place was definitely clean and we'll presented. Also well stocked with whatever suits your taste buds. I am very appreciative of the baristas who made my drink while I waited, as I had gotten there early. I am also very grateful that Allen took the time out to interview me, thanks fellow Blue Bottlers!< /Review>

The carne asada tacos and the nachos are quite tasty but the horchata water is much too sweet. The staff is also very friendly and helpful but I don't like the fact that every time you buy a big order of nachos they give you a different price and they serve you only half of the container. When I reviewed this restaurant three years ago they used to serve you the full container in spite of the fact that they always gave you a different price when you ordered them. Nowadays if you want them to give you the whole container you have to buy the small one. Back then it didn't matter whether you bought the big container or the small one because they always gave you the correct amount of food. But I cannot deny the fact that I would love to tast the super burrito and the flan. I hope that I can do that very soon.<//text>

I've been going to this place since I was 13 years old and never have I been disappointed by the food regardless of what I ordered. They have good salsa and even better service. The only thing I wished for is that the added more radishes and limes to my condiment bag.< /Review>

I've been going there my whole life and my parents have been going since before I was born. I love the carne asada nachos and the loaded burritos (big enough for 2 or 3). I also love the atmosphere of the place. The employees are very kind.</text>

<review>Great food, great prices. They have a lot of inside seating too. The staff is really friendly, and they are quick! I have usually ordered burritos, and the nachos once (fyi the use the liquidy baseball stadium style nacho cheese)
Will definitely be continuing to come back :)<//review>< user_id>

My past visits have been Good ones for the most part. This place has so much tasty food to offer and its open late. Some people take so long to order and pay here though. The parking can be so small since there are other locations next to this spot. Please go early and help the line Move.<//Review>

If you love Asada fries as much as me then this is the place to eat it! My friends love it and I do too. Everything is great here ! But they take cash not card, unless you want to be charged a fee . They have an ATM inside Incase you’re in a hurry.  Anyways, I hope you enjoy eating here !</text>

Agree with the foursquare recs ok the potato tacos and super burrito. The Super burrito is like 3 burritos in one for 9.50. Great deal and very tasty.

Low end of an already low-end genre of utility grade Mexican food. Not appalling, of course, but not really all that great. There are plenty of other places for cheap tacos that seem better.< /Text>

Good food but to charge $1.75 to use your credit card!!!! Come on!!  No se hagan ways con eso pinche cabrones i would understand  if they charge .50 cents like other places. My nephew put 2 quaters in the street fighter machine i told the guy if the machines work he reply i dont know? U WORK THERE HOW DONT U KNOW? nd he didnt offer to give the 50cents like i said the burritos  are good. But service not good at all they look like they are always mad< /text>

I'm like the tipacal person that orders nachos with an horchata,  their nachos are thin as paper n the beans are sour. They r getting cheap, they r not the same as long time ago. Never going back. If u don't believe me try them,rather go to carnitas micoacan.</review>

<text>Favorite Mexican spot. Excellent food, horchata has the perfect blend of cinnamon, sugar & milk, with me never leaving dissatisfied. The owners have finally put poles outside to prevent on-site crashing, so no need to worry as you play arcade games. Only one restroom, but not does not affect experience too much.  Best burritos are machaca (steak & egg) & super (double the size a normal one). Cut up radishes, carrots & jalapeños always provided.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

For ten years I went to the other Atacor. For the last ten years, I've been going here. I always get the same thing: burrito al pastor puro carne with grilled onions. It is phenomenal.

I also order rafts of tacos for parties and they are excellent.<//review>

<text>Hit or a miss if you come here often enough. Last time I went burrito de asada had a ton of beans with hardly any meat. Al  pastor is decent. Service isn't that great I've had times where one day the lady taking orders is in a great mood and others (alot more) in not such a great mood.<//text>< Pictures>

The ORIGINAL El Atacor! 1st El Atacor restaurant they opened.  Best carne asada tacos & burritos. Especially when you get them to go and have been in the foil paper marinating  for at least 10 minutes! Trust me, it makes a big difference!<//Text>
