Hands down this is the best place I've gone to in San Jose. Kassim and his team are AMAZING! I can't say enough how generous Kassim is with his time and his prices. They also work really fast to get any repair work done. What I love about him most is that he doesn't cheat you and is a super fair guy. They can fix ANYTHING and are very passionate about what they do and very professional!< /text>

Got a screw in my tire on my way to work at 8:30 ish. When I got out at 6:30pm, my tire was almost flat. Called this shop because it was down the street. Even though they close at 7 on Fridays, Kasim’s response: “oh come right now. We wouldn’t want you to have a flat in the morning!” Even though he was still busy with another car and his day was done, he stopped what he was doing to repair my tire (which probably wouldn’t have survived the night). Only charged me $20.

And he has really a nice cat. If anything, go for the cat lol< /review>< Pics>

My SUV needed some TLC as we moved from Chicago to Santa Clara. After doing some research and reviews, I called K & S and explained my issue. I took my car in for inspection and diagnosis. Kasim and his staff were great, honest, and have a great sense of humor. They showed me the issues and provided highly reasonable prices. My car was fixed in a day with no delays. K & S will be my mechanic for as long as I live in the bay area. Great MAJSTOR, great SHOP, and great PEOPLE.<//review>

< Review>
I am so impressed with the service I got today !  I called up at around 3:30 and told them I would be there at 4:00 to get a nail puncture in my tire fixed. When I showed up, they were ready to look at the car and they had the tire fixed in 15 minutes !  All of this service for a really good price as well.  When I got back to work, everyone was amazed that I got the tire fixed so quickly.  I highly recommend K & S Auto Repair and will be back for future repairs.</Review>

<Text>Excellent, fast service at a good price. Mckenzie is great! He gave me a very clear timeline and stuck to it, helped me understand what I did (and didn't) need to fix on my broken Prius bumper, and even offered to fix up a couple other little problems for no extra charge.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I have a 2010 Mercedes R350 and have damage (heavy dent and scratch) on rear panel and bumper from the accident. I decided to trust the review on this page and contact him. He is turned out to be super responsive and man of word including honesty. Honesty is a virtue. He made my Mercedes brand new again from the fix in promised time. I do not know how he did it but incredible job he did it for me. I really recommend him to take care of any vehicle damage and he will do his magic. If you search bodyshop, search no more. He will take good care of any vehicle.<//text>

We made an appointment for a quick inspection at 2PM; they said it would take less than an hour. When we arrived, they said it would be 2-3 hours before they even started looking at it. That's not how appointments work.< /text>

<text>Kasim and Ray are wonderful. I got 2 nails in 2 tires on my lunch break. They got me in right away and back to work in less than an hour. It's hard to find mechanics that won't take advantage of women who don't have much knowledge about cars which is why I gave them 5 stars. Thanks guys!</text>< gmap_id>

<text>I cannot say enough good things about this wonderful, family-owned little shop! Kasim and his lovely family own this shop and have been extremely efficient, polite, and thorough each time I've been in. I'm almost sad to be upgrading to a newer car since I know I won't be in there as often without my old clunker! 😬 Having said that, I want to clarify- I have never had to go back in again to have any work corrected as they always get it right the first time! Kasim always explains to me/shows me  exactly what needs to be fixed, and what my options are. As a woman I greatly, greatly appreciate this! Additionally, the mechanics he has hired are either naturally great with doing the same or else he has trained them himself. The charges are always extremely reasonable and it has been my experience that they are at the lower range from what I see online as typical repair costs. Kasim and his family are kind, good people and the workers here are fabulous. I highly recommend this shop!! 😊<//text><username>S K<//username><UserId.>113694884965294523554<//UserId.><gmapID>0x808fc97d740bdde3:0x4156cff7f4599ed4<//gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>This shop was wonderful: I got a flat tire on my way out of work, and all nearby tire & mechanic shops were closed. I saw K&S was still open and rushed there: the owner was able to patch my tire and check all my other tires within 10 minutes. He meant to leave for an appointment just when I arrived but saw that I was totally out of luck! It was just totally stellar service, and since it's near my work I'll definitely be taking my car back! Thanks so much!!< /text>< pictures>

< review>
10 STARS: AMAZING! Excellent, helpful, and honest! My car's "check engine" light appeared when it was due for a smog check. Kasim said that I had already spent enough $ on diagnostics ($169 paid to ANOTHER shop) and so he kindly reduced his diagnostics' charge. The other shop asked for well over $400 more just to continue their diagnostics and remove the engine where they reportedly isolated an emissions problem. Fast forward to Kasim at K & S, and LESS than $300 later, when my car's issue was successfully diagnosed, fixed, and passed the emissions test. I will return and highly recommend K & S Complete Auto Repair to anyone who wants a pleasant interaction with a more than fair and skilled mechanic. Thank you so much, Kasim!!!< /review>

I work for a non-profit organization that accepts cars as donations, and for over a decade, Kasim has helped us in fixing up broken down cars and preparing them to give to people in need in the community. He does this as a service to humanity and charges us minimally. Just a great mechanic and an even better person, highly recommended!</text>

<Review>I couldn't be happier with the service and attention to detail when the alternator in my car needed to be replaced. They not only rushed to finish repairing it since I was stranded more than 100 miles from home, Kasim stayed late to personally pick up the parts needed. Amazing guys who genuinely care.< /Review>< Pics>

Car stalled out on the highway by going into limp mode. Had the tow truck deliver it here. They had a diagnosis within an hour, and a fix (2 sensor replacements) by the next day. Friendly, fast, great quality, and at a good price. I would highly recommend this place to others.</text>

This is a Great place to get your vehicle serviced as well as for auto body work! I looked at the yelp reviews and approached him for an estimate. Kasim is a very straight forward and reliable person. There were quite a few issues in my car that had to fixed like rear bumper make up, front brakes, slow acceleration and rear passenger window controller etc. For evident issues he gave the estimate on the spot and for uncertain issues he gave me a fair idea and also told me upfront that they will know the exact issue only when they inspect the car. While they worked on the rear bumper, simultaneously they did a free full inspection of the car and gave me all the details. Really appreciate his clear and quick communication!! Infact he also sent me the old front brake rotor and air filter pics for records. He was also generous to include other minor paint touch ups as part of the bumper paint service. After 2 days, all issues in my car were fixed and its looking and working great right in time before the New Year! Overall a very satisfying experience and I highly recommend this place!!!</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I wanted to give more than 5 stars for K & S and Kasim for being friendly every time I visit, and not overcharge me, but giving great and reliable service every time.

Alright..... this is my second car and a second review for k & s on Yelp. I have been visiting k & s for 3 years now... I know Kasim very well ( the owner / manager ). I was driving old Audi before and he helped me fix the issues with my old car at a reasonable price every time. Now I m driving a new vw, and I came back to k & s for my car regular maintenance service. He quoted me 250 dollars for the maintenance and labor for what a vw service dealer quoted me 600 dollars.....

I like the k & s for 3 main reasons....

1. I never made any appointment, but Kasim somehow worked out to fix my car and return on same day.

2. He has a great ambience , he drops me off at a local coffee shop on his car or help me pick up lunch while my car is under maintenance. his staff seemed very experienced and knowledgeable.

3. Never overcharged or over quoted. He is very customer focused, very welcoming and carries a great responsibility in every action he does, whether taking to a customer or fixing his car.

I'm definitely coming back to k & s and highly recommend.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Kasim repaired the broken rear view mirror of my Honda Civic 2013 (even replacing the top painted panel from the old mirror on top of new one), removed the dent and scratched paint - all in all for 200$ on a busy Saturday in just over 3 hours.

Will definitely recommend this guy - most of all because he has has honest pricing and tries to salvage and improvise on the situation as much as possible.<//Review>

<Review>I have had few occasions of having my car repaired at Kasim's place and have been very satisfied always. It has been fast and convenient.
Kasim (the owner) is very genuine in his assessment of the problem and honest in his estimate. He is a person who will work with you to get right parts & repairs within your budget and at the same time not compromise on quality or security.
If you are looking for honest & cost effective way of having your car repaired, this is the place you will want to come.
And by the way, he has a very cute cat hanging around in the office.< /Review>< Rate>

<review>Khasim works for you and your car, meaning you can get good work done fast and cleanly. Price can be steep, but that's a factor of the area rather than the mechanics themselves.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I was twice falsely convicted in Merced County.  The Merced Sheriff’s department kidnapped me, had me beaten, and extorted money from my family.  Todd Mclean, Travis Colby, and Judge Harry Jacobs, made up their own rules in order to excessively order psychological evaluations and lie about the results.  I was forced into a plea for crimes I did not commit and then they made illegal terms and conditions of probation in order to send me to prison.  I confronted Todd about this only to have his girlfriend Stephanie Jamieson stalk and intimidate me.  Then, Cherie Mendenhall, Laura Parmenter, and Robin Baptista made up some part of their testimony in order to have me falsely convicted on a threat to blow up the Merced Court house in order to imprison me.  Vincent Andrade is the lead public defender.
Recall Warnke!
The Sheriff purposely allowed 6 criminals, some of them murders to escape in order to create a rouse in order to fund money for a new jail.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

❤️ this church and their daycares are awesome! Also their family events they hold on holidays are so much fun. Even when I didn’t go to some services they called me personally to check up on my family.< /text>

<review>I used to really love the environment here, however things are not what they used to be. The environment is very judgmental and not what a church should be at all. I am sad to say this as many friends and family attend this church, but I will not be going back. While I am sure this is not what the entirety of the church represents,  a few employees are judgmental, hypocritical, and act as though only the most pure souls should be there. So sad.<//review>< Pics>

Great church. Very family friendly. If you like more of a family feel, this might be a good fit for you. Also, solid theology.<//review>

Gateway Community Church is a special family of believers comprised of many of my friends and dear siblings in Christ.  I can honestly encourage seekers and followers of Jesus to gather together her and call this family of believers THEIR VERY OWN family of believers.  The local church is a gift God gives each of us, and it's our opportunity to either accept this gift or reject it.  As a pastor of a very small church in Merced, I deeply appreciate knowing where I can point people looking for a larger church family and context to worship our Risen Lord, Jesus Christ.  Gateway is one of those families of believers I can encourage folks on toward seeking out and joining.  Al and I have build some friendship as well as Mark and several others.  Some of my closest friends including Charles P are also a part of this family.  May there be more and more unity among believers in Merced as we TOGETHER follow the Lord Jesus Christ in His mission to rescue sinners from themselves and draw them into His eternal embrace in the true and life-changing story of Jesus' death in our place!<//Text>

I first started coming to Gateway Community Church in March of 2013 when I started a work site at LifeLine CDC. I felt very comfortable and welcomed the first time that I came to Sunday service. Through the help of Pastor Al and my boss, Monika Grasley, I was baptized for my first time out at Yosemite Lake during Gateway's Lake service on September 8, 2013 and have enjoyed coming to service ever since.

Thank you to Gateway's Pastor, Staff, and the many volunteers!

<text>This location of Big Straw is okay, the actual boba balls are flavorless however, the thai tea drink is hit or miss, my favorite right now is chocolate/peanut butter/coffee mix. So so so good!!! Still the best boba you can find in town.< /text><username>jules inwonderland< /username>< response>

This is my absolute favorite Boba place. I've been to other Boba places around Ventura and Santa Barbara and they are quite honestly very bougie and just not as good as Bigstraw Boba. Bigstraw is just amazing. You can easily see the passion for what they do, and it comes out in just how delicious the drinks are. They're simple, but that's how it should be. Easy to understand ingredients with a lot of modifications to reduce the sugar, or replace ingredients if you have allergies. The number of flavors they have is mind-blowing - there truly is something for everyone and you can't go wrong. Also, as an artist I have to say 8 love their aesthetic and that logo design is great.

I tell literally everyone I know that Bigstraw Boba is the absolute best.< /Text>

Love this place! Takes a while if there are long lines so plan to sit tight if it is packed. Otherwise it can be an in and out stop. Busy on weekends. During the week or before closing usually isn't packed.</Review>

Never had boba before, it was a pleasant suprise! Working my way threw the menu all the flavors have been very good so far. (Edit) if you order w/out boba they tend to put it in there anyways, habit i guess.</Review>

<review>Bigstraw Boba was not a great experience at all! When asked about milk substitutes, the cashier explained that the batches were premade from the day before. She also communicated that they had no milk substitutes and when asked about what type of milk they used to prepare it, she said the person who made it was not there and she did not know what they put in the boba. Not great service. Staff does not know their own products and what they provide. Would not recommend.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80e84c4e6baf5af3:0x415cba5a474972f7< /gmap_id></record>

The taro slush tasted like trash. The thai iced tea was tolerable. The service was not the best.

I would compare boba to coffee in that it's something you can't easily mess up. When a place can't even get typical boba flavors right, I wouldn't bother trying anything else. Save your money and spare yourself from a utterly disatisfying experience.

Also, no restrooms available.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Response>None</Response><Text>After breaking down going up the mountain about 20 mins from the destination cabin and being towed, figured out the alternator does in my truck. They had the alternator for my 97 runner, staff was efficient and was available right away, have them a call. Went down to purchase it and replaced it in my cabin Airbnb, truck was running smoothly after using new part provided by them, definitely recommended for all your automotive needs.< /Text>< Rate>

<text>Better quality parts then the other store in town .. Doug the manager can be hard to deal with but is generally helpful. Don't carry many parts in store so almost everything you buy is atleast a day wait ..< /text><Rating>5< /Rating>< username>

<Review>Knowledgeable and friendly, and a nice selection. If they don't have it they can order it for you, and if you're a car novice like me they'll help you find everything as long as you can sorta communicate what it is that you need. Overall just a great experience from friendly people.</Review>< UserId.>

I ordered a cold pie with ants surrounding it from here. First issue was the driver didn’t understand instructions and I was on the phone with him for 15 minutes to walk him through the apartment community. Second, after I finally got the pizza, it was cold and COVERED in ants. I called immediately and told the manager and he told me to send a picture of the ants and i sent it, he is trying to tell me that it was me that has ants.... I asked them to come get their pizza and to remake or refund and they didn’t do anything. Fast forward to today, no refund and the guy is asking for a picture again. This place is absolute garbage! With uneducated guys that can’t read and apparently keep their kitchen and cars clean.</review>

Thanks again for your ad that I had come across. Your Papadias are out of this WORLD. The only complaint I have is your driver. He looked like he didn't want to deliver or he was mad. IDK, but that's the only issue. I even gave him a cash tip. He didn't even say Hi or Hello. Keep up the good work 😍😍😍.

<text>I ordered a pizza for delivery. l tracked it using the tracking tool. The order showed delivered but I hadn’t received my order. I called the store. No one answered for over 15 minutes. I called corporate. This was a fifteen minute call in which they attempted to call the store, no one answered. Corporate told me I’d receive a refund and someone would call me within 48 hours. No call or refund ever came. The store attempted to make it right, When they called me an hour later, by delivering HALF of the order I was charged for.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80857e6c1d2c7ec9:0x2fb7c76b5bd650d2< /gmapID></record>

Small store, not a good place to eat at if you have a party of 5+. But, they typically make their pizzas quickly - 15 mins easily on a weekday around 3-4 pm. Staff are kind and seem to work hard when customers are around. All in all, good place to get your pizzas (but not necessarily eat at). 😀<//review>

Food is good but the employees here are incompetent and somewhat rude. Definitely need to improve customer service.< /review>

Ordered a works pizza that I was really skeptical about, but it turned out not to be that bad. My only gripe is the customer service here. There were 3 dude's standing around talking about whatever as I stood at the counter and they ignored me for at least a minute or so. Very rude in my opinion, especially when I'm the only one in the store. That's why I giving them a 2 star rating rather than a 3.</text>

<text>**Be aware**
They will take your order and not fulfill it.
I placed an order online and received a confirmation, only to wait an hour and a half before finding out they would not fulfill the order.
Makes their owner being a racist seem cool in comparison to the service they are providing< /text><UserId.>113005987845277532847<//UserId.><response>None</response><time>1540717478482</time></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I’ve been a South Bay Body Shop customer for 5 years and always had great results at a fair price.  In addition to the high quality of their work they also are very good about meeting their promised schedules and keeping me updated on the progress of the work.  They are very pleasant to work with and they go out of their way to find the least expensive way to get the job done.
I have recommended South Bay Body Shop to many friends who have used their services and then thanked me for the referral.< /review>

I had read the good reviews about South Bay Body Shop, which was my determining factor in choosing them to get my windshield replaced as well as getting my car looekd at and worked on for some damage to the undercarriage. Despite reading the great reviews, I was still blown away by how amazing my experince was! They were kind, professional, quick, and took away all my stress. They went above and beyond to help and gained a customer for life!</Text>

<review>I took my Honda Odyssey here after a minor accident. I chose this shop due to all the positive reviews online. The shop was great at communicating to me about the repairs. The shop owner, Derek, is very focused on customer satisfaction. They go above and beyond to ensure customers are happy with their service. If you have anything less than a great experience, I would not hesitate to contact Derek. My minivan looked great when they were done. I will definitely use them in the future if I’m in accident again.<//review>< Time>

I took my 2014 Toyota Scion XB to San Pedro Auto Body Repair after a minor accident. My accident was in San Pedro and was referred here by AAA and I’m glad they did. The girls in the office were very nice and respectful. Their communication was wonderful.  They went above and beyond to ensure I was happy and satisfied with their service. They gave me a date of when my car would be complete...well it was finished before that date and it was beautiful. The staff that worked on my car did an excellent job.  When they were done there were no signs of trauma to my car. It actually looked better than when I brought it in. I will definitely use them in the future if ever I need auto repair.

I came here for repairs on my bumper and they were excellent. Super nice, they also have a shuttle. The estimated time my car was going to be ready was 7 days. It was finished in 3 days!! And they even washed it! Also after I paid my deductible they gave me a complimentary large chocolate bar.... even better!! I am definitely coming back here.</review>

< review>
I have been a client for 5 years. I had a horrible accident with $17,000 in damage to my cute Fiat Convertible but they made my car look brand new again! I was very happy with the mastery of their work and the wonderful customer service!  They have since been there for my fiance'e's BMW 5 series and the service and workmanship were exemplary. Consistency is obviously important to them.</review>

They fixed my baby my prius and looks brand new. Fast service got it within a week and they cleaned it and buffed out scratches. Plus Hector and the team were all super nice and you get a chocolate after picking up your car. I've never gone to a body shop alone so this was a great first time experience. They helped me feel at ease and called me to let me know what was happening with my car.< /text>

<Text>Derrick went above and beyond to get my Acura driving tight. It was a nightmare job. He busted his ass and comped me a suspension job in lieu of a refund which would have also been cool of him but left me looking for a body shop that could equal his... Probably an impossible task.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

< review>
My car is falling apart... And then I got hit in an accident.  I was not looking forward to having my car in the shop, as my last experience at a body shop was absolutely  dreadful. So, I pop into the shop... first, I noticed that the lobby is full of retro appliances etc etc and the coffee table is a repurposed engine... I SO need one of those!
So, I fill out forms, and Derrick is the man assigned to work with me (poor guy)
They get me to my rental place and I get the word it will be about a week.
My ride was ready in LESS than that time, and was fixed better than what it looked like before it was hit.
Derrick was honest with me, and didn't make promises he couldn't keep. He let me know if they found something wrong and they did great work.
About an hour after I picked up my ride... as my luck would have it. I blew a radiator hose. Unbelievably, Derrick offered to have it fixed, with me paying for the hose. It was not even related to the body issue, and the crew at South Bay was gonna take care of it.
Now, I was able to fix it... But the fact that they would take care of me when not even necessary, is priceless. They set themselves apart from any other body shop.
They also gave me candy, which my daughter loved.
If and when I crash again, they will be the ONLY place I get my car fixed at.
I ALSO reccommended them to Enterprise for thier corporate accounts. . . Because that's what you do when you appreciate great work<//review>

South Bay Body Shop was a pleasure to do business with. The staff was friendly, competent and receptive. Scheduling and having the service done was a breeze. And not for nothing, the vintage decor in the lobby is awesome. I may just go hang out in there when I'm in the neighborhood.<//Review>

After rear ending someone in San Diego these guys were so helpful having my car towed for a great price and giving me a rental car for 5 days while my parts were being shipped and car being fixed. They also stand behind any issues that may come up during or after. I had a seat belt issue that they fixed just because I asked after my car was fixed and out.< /Review>

My car was in a pretty serious accident and repaired here last year. At that time the odometer reading was about 15000miles. I thought they did a good job. But I didn't really notice the tires at the time.

Now the odometer reading is 31000. All of the tires need to be changed. ALL of them. This body shop is the only place has EVER touched my tires. My original tires should last at least 50000 Mls. I only drive this car in the city, high way. Never some rock road or village. NEVER.

Perhaps you'll say that my driving habit or something can also affect it. But I DO NOT think it would reduce my tire durability by 40%.

Stay away. Or check after their work EXTREMELY carefully.< /Text>

They told me that my car would be ready in 17 days, it is more than a month and is not ready, I was told that today December 31 would be ready ... Today is Saturday and do not open seems to be that the customer is their mockery, they are Irresponsible people who do not keep their word.</Text>

< Review>
The sandwiches were good, but the service was TERRIBLE. The tall, skinny blonde kid who "helped" me was very rude and blunt, like it was bothering him to make my sandwich. Needless to say, I WON'T be returning until the service improves.< /Review>

Michael, Isaiah, and Zane did a great job helping me with my order. They worked well together.
Michael made sure to clean before making my son's gluten free sandwich, isaiah introduced me to a new vanilla agave cream soda, and Zane worked the grill and register.
Always a good experience at JMs< /review>

I love how the employes there are always smiling, always representing the order that you want, and helping me with my rewards program so i can get more points.  The food there is better than subway and is worth the price!</Review>

Rude service. Stale bread; the crust is hard almost like it has been toasted, but it hasn't, it's just been left out too long. This location is new and the employees don't seem to know how to make good Jersey Mike's sandwiches yet. Recommend going to another Jersey Mike's if you want a good experience.<//Text>

Just submitted for an edit on Google Maps, as the pin for this location was located in the Arco bushes across the street.  It is not by Arco, it’s by the Taco Bell and Dublin Donuts!<//review>

<text>My husband and I got married here about a year ago and it was an amazing day! The whole Wedgewood team was so nice and attentive. Each person we interacted with was very patient and answered all our questions. They had a great wedding planning binder that helped me get everything organized. It even helped plan the little details like a timeline, music, decorations... everything! Things I did not know I needed to think about on my wedding day but helped tremendously. On the day of the wedding, they took care of everything and I did not have to lift a finger! They even allowed our dog at the venue to be a part of the wedding! All of our guests had a great time. The venue is beautiful with many great spots for photos. The only bad thing is that the bar was in a different room than the dance floor which created two separate party areas and took away from the dance floor. But it’s not their fault our guests liked to drink!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<userid>112668574755743225274< /userid><text>A beautiful venue for our wedding. The all-inclusive package was perfect and the staff was supportive throughout the whole planning process. They were flexible where we wanted to customize and were knowledgeable about how best to set things up. The day-of coordinator was perfect in ensuring we didn’t have to stress at all on the wedding day, he made sure to take all the questions and was skilled at making sure the day ran smoothly. It is pricey and we did have to bring a lot of our own decor as they have limited decor to use but we couldn’t be happier with how the day turned out!</text>< Date>

FANTASTIC!!!
My husband and I had a stunning sunset wedding at Wedgewood on May 18th, 2018. The venue was just unbelievably beautiful. It was small, quaint and intimate, which my husband and I really loved that about it.The team was just amazing, and worked very hard on making sure that I and my husband were well taking care of, and very happy with everything. Every guests couldn’t stop giving us compliments about how stunning and gorgeous this venue was.
It is definitely an A+ location to get married. We would recommend this place to anyone....such an amazing experience!

Thank you very much Wedgewood team, for helping us have the best wedding day we could ever ask for!</Review>< pics>

As the Mother of the Bride, I could not have been happier with the service and quality we received. They were flexible and professional every step of the way.  Everything was planned out and explained with no hidden or surprise costs.  My daughter loved her big day and thanks to the staff I did too.</Review>

<text>Wedgewood literally took care of everything! I felt like a princess and all I had to do was grab my flowers and show up. Their photographer they use created absolutely stunning photos! They put up with my crazy wedding party on rehearsal like it was nothing. Our wedding planner always stayed in touch through the two years we were planning. The most important part is the guests all said the food was the best wedding food they ever had . It was buffet but you did not lose quality or taste because of it. They provide so much for an amazing price. Thank you for the best day if my life wedgewood!</text><GmapID>0x80dc7842d5582c93:0xad018f1449c4f2e4< /GmapID>< user_id>

Overall, I really liked my wedding at Wedgewood. It was a very easy process, they allowed us to pay in installments, the food was great, and everyone was really nice. I would say hire someone to make sure you receive everything you pay for, as I was missing several items I paid for. For example, they forgot to hire security that they mandated I have and pay for, forgot to put out the games I paid for, lost some of my decorations, forgot to turn on the fire places, and forgot to turn on the fountain. This is why I have 4 starts instead of 5. They did reimburse me, but it was just disappointing, especially just forgetting to turn on the fire places and fountain. Those were some of the main reasons I picked that location and I can’t get that day back.</Text>

<Text>I seriously cannot say enough good things about Wedgewood Fallbrook. All of the ladies there from Katey, to Aubrey, to Sydney, were absolutely fantastic and a pleasure to work with. They are so responsive through email, phone, in-person, I seriously don't have one flaw or criticism. They are angels there to make your day go as smooth as possible, with sincere smiles on their faces. Sydney was my day-of coordinator and she rocked it! I let her handle and I had no worries at all as the day went perfectly! I will forever be recommending Wedgewood to anyone who will listen! Thank you ladies!< /Text>< UserId.>

<Text>I usually stop by in the mornings right before I go into work whenever I need something. Jacob is who I usually ask for. He is always super helpful and is such a nice gentleman. I went in last week and apparently he doesn't work early mornings anymore? I got helped by an older man who obviously did not want to help me and he ended up getting me the wrong part... so disappointed.< /Text><date>1612983939746</date><user_id>114043742578065275744</user_id>< response>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>I waited at the front counter for several minutes with staff members seeing me and ignoring me. I even said Hello hoping a visible staff member would come to the counter, but no luck. Finally, when a staff member came to the front area I asked if I could get assistance. He mumbled something and I said I'm happy to go elsewhere if y'all want to ignore me. Finally someone came to the counter and offered assistance. He was quite nice and we had pleasant conversation during the transaction where I spent over $200. The owner may want to conduct a refresher on customer service and watching the front counter for customers. Also, anyone could have easily walked in and stolen stuff without being noticed.</review></record>

Needed a cabin air filter and Napa was half the price of the chain parts store. So I was able to get a bottle of evaporator cleaner too.<//Review>

Customer service was horrible at the store. I One clerk started complaining because I was asking questions. Very unsupportive. The clerk said Yelp doesn't make a difference in their business they don't really care about satisfying customer needs. Apparently with what I found out independent NAPA stores cannot give you a refund if you buy things at other NAPA stores. So this was a waste of time drove out of my way 10 miles to come to this store will not do it again do not recommend it. Again rudeness and lack of explaining policy satisfactorily.

I received a  call from the owner. He was polite and considerate as we talked through the incident. I was very impressed how he handled the whole incident. KC the owner has earned by respect and patonage. Thanks KC, you restored my confidence in your store!</Text>

2 stars for the one employee with courtesy, but I will not be returning.

I knew I needed a battery. Had to get a jump to get to your store. Came in and explained to the older gentleman my situation and he said he could test it if he could get the machine out there. He managed to get the tester out to my car, which was in their lot, and hooked it up. It read bad battery. He also said the leads were bad and that they would need to be replaced but no one at the store would be able to install or help with said task. He closes up my truck and took his machine back inside as he watched me get into my car to attempt to start it. It wouldn't. I went back into the store to find anyone who would be able to jump my car so I could go elsewhere to find the help I sought. Apparently this was asking too much of the older "gentleman". Fortunately, there was a man working there with the grace to go get his own truck to use jump my car. Had it not been for him, I would have needed to ask the only other customer in the store who had already exchanged words with the older gentleman about parking in their lot but visiting another establishment before shopping at NAPA. After the threat to have his vehicle towed, he did his shopping anyway. Maybe he would have helped me jump my car? Or I could have called roadside assistance and explained to the tow truck driver why I needed a jump outside an open establishment that sells car batteries.

The resolution was that the battery was bad and was replaced at Autozone. The battery leads were not a problem! They need a little cleaning, not replacing. This was also done as the battery was installed. There is no good reason other than this encounter that I couldn't have purchased a battery from Napa in Clovis and been on my merry way, and they would have had my business, and possibly return business in the future.

I will not be returning in the foreseeable future. 2 stars are given specifically for the employee who used his own truck to jump my car. Thanks to you, I was able to make it to Autozone!</text>

<Review>We found this place on YouTube so we have it a shot.   It's homemade ice-cream and very tasty.   The worker was friendly and offered us unlimited samples.   After painstakingly trying many flavors we finally got it right: the cone is Thai tea and brown bread; the cup is brown bread and Hong Kong coffee - YUMMY!< /Review>< user_name>

The guy that runs the store is the most professional and knowledgeable ice cream scooper. I believe his name was Jon. I have tried every single flavour and I must say that the Brown Bread was amazing. I recommend all my friends to come here.< /Review>

They have some interesting flavors that you won’t see elsewhere. Some were good but some miss the mark or didn’t blow me away. Definitely better than your standard ice cream shop though.

It’s a very small shop, very basic setup (it almost seems unfinished?) they could probably improve on overall appearance.

5 sample maximum for tasting.</Text>

<Text>So very very good. I use to live just up the hill from the original Scoops in Highland Park, and couldn't believe my luck when a new one randomly opened just down the way from me here in North Torrance. My one and ONLY note/warning, is that if you have little kids that will only eat the most basic of flavors, then maybe stop by when they are in school. Otherwise this is a must for all who love ice creme!!< /Text><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

This place has tasty gelato but that's it. The vibe is a struggle mostly because the fluorescent lights and the limited uncomfortable
seating makes you feel like you're in a doctors waiting room. Good service and tasty gelato (including dairy free) but not a good place to chill.</text>

Very friendly service! Different flavors daily and pretty cool option to taste them all for 1 dollar. If ever none of the flavors jump out at me, but I'd still be curious what they taste like, I'll try that dollar option. Ice cream sandwiches, soda floats and cold brew coffee floats also available. Pistachio saffron was great today! Was told it's rare for them to make it.</text>

Stopped here after getting some sushi down the street. Nice new, modern place. They have a handful of ice cream flavors and other treats. We tried a few samples, all which were yummy. Our favorite was the charcoal activated pineapple option, hmmm delicious. It looks like this place is still spanking new, it got crowded quick after we were there I am assuming trying to sample the new treats.</Text>

If you’ve never been to scoops, go now. It’s so good. The flavors are so original (they also have more traditional flavors) and so creative, they put combinations together that I never would’ve myself but they’re SO good. My personal favorite, and a staple of the shop is brown bread. It’s not too sweet and both creamy and crunchy. Overall, over never tried a flavor that I didn’t like from Scoops. They also have tons of metered parking out front and the staff is super friendly.</review>

There was one man running the whole store who was very kind and helpful. He allowed us to sample some flavors and then proceeded to serve us our ice cream. He gave a friendly and welcoming vibe to my party. The flavors of the ice cream were also great although, they change everyday except brown bread. Brown bread is the everyday flavor that is available every day.</review></record></dataset><record>

This is hands down my favorite ice cream place!!
Unlike most ice cream parlors it's always a surprise what flavors they will have as they make them daily and they are very creative with the flavors.
For example I had tea/lavender and mint/green teA today and it was super delicious.
I have yet to leave there and not be utterly happy...
Also staff is always super friendly.
Overall this place is to me the most precious gem in that whole neighborhood.< /review>

Welcome to Torrance, Scoops! They just did a soft opening starting today!!! Go there cause it's delicious for all ice cream lovers including non-dairy people. I was so excited to eat that I didn't even take a pic of my ice cream! Rookie mistake.

A small little shop in the Nijiya plaza with ample parking, unfortunately not a ton of seating inside. Some bench seating against the wall, but a ton of flavors including 8 regular ice cream flavors and 4 non-dairy flavors made with oat milk! Prices are reasonable and the scoops portions are huge. I went for the one scoop with two flavors, which is really 2 scoops, and it was basically a meal in itself. They also will use your own bowl if you present them with it. Sampling is allowed and the guy there was super nice and friendly.

MAPLE NON VEGAN CHOCOLATE CHIP (NON-DAIRY)
This doesn't taste like oat milk at all! I love that it's creamy and not icy like other non-dairy ice creams can be. A very subtle maple flavor with tiny chocolate chips. So simple, yet so delicious.

ALMOND CARDAMON BURNT SUGAR (NON-DAIRY)
Loved this one. As a gluten free person, I miss out on textures in food. The burnt sugar really added a crumb like texture that really made me keep eating spoonful after spoonful of this one. The almond and cardamon are perfect accents to make this ice cream nicely complex.< /review>

<Review>It was amazingly delicious. Especially the burnt coconut banana ice cream. That was an experience in its own. I would come back anytime. And the restroom was pretty OK as well. Additionally, the guy running the counter was very knowledgeable about all of the flavors and was very generous with ice cream tasting.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Myself and nine others wanted good ice cream and what we got was amazing ice cream and exceptional service. Scoops offered a few original flavors that anyone would love, but they also have specialty items. I enjoyed one scoop of Turkish Coffee and one scoop of Pistachio Cardamom. Prices are the cheapest in LA. For my two LARGE scoops and a free cone (cones are always free) the price was $4.65. Stop by and I'm sure you will leave with a smile.</Review>

Oh... my... god... the ice cream here is number one. I don't know what else to say. Besides the long line, which is understandable, they made the ice cream fast. I had the coffee sundae. It was great. Now I want the chocolate sundae. It looked really good. I also love how they weren't stingy with the scoops as well.< /Text>

I love the ice cream here. The flavors change all the time, but you're bound to find something good. The last time I was here I got jasmine strawberry. It was delicious! I would have never thought that those two flavors would mix together well but they complimented each other very nicely.< /Review>

<Text>This location is....interesting. It's like a guerrilla style ice cream shop. Mostly lit up by natural light...not sure how they do business once it gets dark. The place is cooled by a little corner a/c unit. It's funky, with hipster art hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. They had three different vegan ice creams when i was there. I tried two and was pretty impressed with the flavor and consistency of the ice cream. Service was well enough and the bathroom is clean.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Really good ice cream is sold here. Nothing fancy, just clean flavor profiles. They don't do anything crazy...they just do what they do right.

Standing ovation goes to the brown bread flavour: vanilla mixed with grape nut cereal. The crunchy cereal complements the rich vanilla.<//Text>

Went here by a pure chance, lines form randomly so need you need to wait for a little. They have so many flavors to choose from, so it's hard to decide on what you wanted to try, but one staff was very helpful; they let us try some samples of their ice cream and give good recommendations and suggestions on what's best to try. Overall, a good ice cream experience.< /review>

<review>This place is ice cream heaven. Delicious, homemade and unique flavors in generous portions at a tiny and unassuming little storefront just south of LA City College. My personal favorite is brown bread, which I believe is made with Grape Nuts cereal. (Mmmm, fiber.)

You used to be able to get a mug from the coffee shop next door, get a scoop of ice cream, and then get espresso poured over it, but I don't believe that they do this anymore.

You can suggest flavors on a board on the wall. Consider trying your hand at being an ice cream chef.</review><Date>1394234387471<//Date>< UserId.>

<time>1433241373677</time><review>I tried Scoops for the first time a few weeks ago, and I wish I had been wowed because all I thought was "this is just okay" when I had it. None of the flavors (except Brown Bread) sounded all that unique or were great tasting. Though the employee working was more than willing to let us sample, everything tasted overly sweet and flat.

I ended up getting the Brown Bread and the Burnt Sugar Yogurt, but as I kept eating, they both kinda just tasted the same...

Bottom line: I think I need to check the flavors online or call before I head in. I've been wanting to try some flavors that others posted/talked about but they weren't offered when I came in.< /review>< Resp>

Ice cream was very sweet....maybe a little too sweet for my taste but still good.  The service....was very bad.  Left me standing there to attend to other customers before charging me.  If I wanted to, I could have just walked away without paying and I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have noticed....took me 4 tries to get his attention so I could go and leave.</text>

I LOVE SCOOPS!!! Definitely my go to spot after lunch or dinner. This location is a lot bigger than the westside location. I also think the ice cream tastes better here as well!

I always get the Apple Pie and some type of Oreo variation. You can never go wrong with Oreo anything!! The workers are friendly and quick! Only down side is that there is no A/C at this location. During the summers your ice cream melts quick, so eat fast! :)<//text>

I heard all the hoopla about this place so I decided to try it out. I was not disappointed. They do have the best ice cream in Los Angeles. Much better than overrated Fosselman in Alhambra.< /text>

Home made ice cream is the best. Stop by if you have an opportunity for delightful delicate!!! Great bargain for a scoop full of bold flavored. White Chocolate and Raspberry are a favorite.</Text>

This is the best ice cream shop I've tried in the US thus far.

It's great, they make everything by hand each day, be including a bunch of different flavors of the week.

They have non dairy options too</Review>

<Review>Came here at night and there was no line. The guy behind the counter was so helpful! He allowed us to try as many flavors as it took for us to find the one for us and explained what was in each one. He even suggested flavors that he thought would pair well together since you can have two scoops per a bowl.

The ice cream was delicious! I got the lychee and the strawberry flavors and it mixed so well together. The lychee was a sorbet and the lightness of the flavor provided a great contrast to the heavy, milk texture for the strawberry flavor.

Would definitely come back here for more ice cream!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>I read somewhere that this was the best place in LA to get ice cream.  So, as such, I took someone very special out for ice cream on their birthday.  I don't know if it was because it was Sunday, but the number of flavors available was very limited.  I believe I counted six.  We each opted for a different flavor because our palettes are quite different, but we both found that the ice cream was overly sweet.  Interestingly, we noticed something about the customers - they were all adults.  There were no children in the mix.  Would I go back?  Probably not, but as I always say - you need to go try it for yourself.< /Review><Name>Jeannette G.</Name><Rate>2< /Rate><Date>1459727413665< /Date><Response>None<//Response>< pics>

<review>Homemade ice cream with unique flavors (from brown bread to sorbets to a bunch of liqueur-ish flavors). If you're lucky there won't be a line. If you go very very late right when they're about to close (and there's not much of a selection), you may get a freebie or two. ;) Don't forget - a small order comes with two, not one, flavors! Not much has changed year over year here.. and that's a good thing! Don't have any recommendations for flavors because you can just sample them anyway. :D</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c75997725441:0x71d73efeab6d7c29</Gmap_id></record>

This was a first. I have never in my entire life walked out of an ice cream shop with a scoop, but it finally happened. After trying a half dozen flavors I couldn't find anything that didn't have a weird texture or flavor. I can't explain it, but it was pretty bad. It wasn't the worst ice cream on Earth, but then again I was told the flavors change daily, this could have been just a bad day. Of the four of us that went, only two could find anything they liked, and neither of them were thrilled. Luck of the draw I guess.<//Text>

Brown bread is their specialty, but you can't go wrong with any of their ice cream. I've had the jasmine tea, Guinness, and horchata varieties, all awesome. parking is street only.<//Text>

<text>The only time I've ever been disappointed at Scoops is when they run out of one of my favorite gelato flavors.  I've been coming here ever since they opened and they are a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Each visit you can expect the unexpected when it comes to flavor combinations.  From Guinness Chocolate to Honey Ginger, there spectrum of choices ranges from the tried and true to the bold and daring.

Parking is difficult due to the limited spaces in the area so be warned that you may spend more time finding a spot than eating your gelato during peak times.<//text><user>117448333176481320286< /user><pictures>None<//pictures><Name>Moonie Lantion< /Name>< rate>

Great service, samples of all the interesting flavors. Lots of cool unique blends like Ube burnt sugar, hazelnut Chai, and some good vegan options. Will be back!</text>

Such a good value for great tasting ice cream and unique flavors! Must come!

I kept thinking they were undercharging me, how could 2 huge scoops of ice cream be just $3?? They consider "One Scoop" to be 2 huge scoops. and a "Kids Scoop" to be 1 scoop. WOW!

The staff is super nice and helpful with trying flavors. After trying many interesting flavors which rotate out each day, I settled on this winning combo:

**Peanut butter curry ice cream + vanilla Jim beam cheesecake was an amazing combo**

However if you just go in and try a bunch of flavors and don't get anything, there is a $1 tasting fee for all you freeloaders! C'mon it's only $3- I haven't seen anything like this steal in a long while!

The neighborhood this is in is very cool. The businesses on this intersection of Heliotrope and Melrose have good vibes and are trendy. Lots of restoration - renovated apartments, gastropubs, ice cream, clothing stores. It's off the beaten path of the more popular part of Melrose, but definitely worth the visit!</text>

I came from Long Beach to meet up for dinner with my foodie date. We had Scoops before dinner because I was curious about their famous Brown Bread ice cream. I love quirky flavors and this was on my to-eat-list. Unfortunately I showed up too late and they were out of Brown Bread. The staff managed to scrape a mini-spoonful out so I could sample it.

I have a bad habit of wanting to try unique flavors/food or entres/beverage with weird names (ie. Alien Blood from Raw, Basil ice cream from Rose Creamry, Gen Mai Cha Latte from Cafe Dulce, bug dishes from Typhoon, etc). Not everything I try is amazing, it's a hit or miss lol  But it makes my food album on my facebook pretty entertaining.

Brown Bread ice cream was def a HIT! It tasted like bread with a good balance of the sweetness from the ice cream. I'm not saying its my favorite flavor, but I would like to order a scoop next time I'm in the area.

I got 2 scoops:
- blueberry cream: thumbs up
- green tea - peanut butter ice cream: meh< /Text>< pictures>

<review>One scoop= two scoops here. Remember that.
They have new flavors everytime but the only one they consistently have is brown bread. WHICH IS AMAZING!!
I came in thinking I would only get one scoop, but ended up coming back for seconds. The ice cream is rich enough but not too rich that I couldn't finish it all. They let you choose two flavors for those two scoops. And they encourage you to sample as well. They have quirky flavors like jagermeister and chai ricotta. I got the brown bread and banana something.. the first time. And brown bread and guiness tiramisu 5 minutes later. The second combo was def better!

Cash only!

Tip: Get the cup so you'll be qualified for a cheaper refill! If you like the cone, you can request to put the cone on top! Cone wasn't that great though :x< /review><Name>Lisa<//Name><pics>None<//pics><rate>5</rate><user_id>117371214850934387732</user_id></record>

At this point I've tried all the boutique ice cream shops in the area and Scoops is tied with Carmellas  for the top spot.  Scoops predates the other shops also, so they get points for that distinction as well.</review>

Purchased a Fan Filter from Terra Universal and what an amazing team.  I didn't realize I had ordered a unit w/o the cord.  Used their chat feature on the website and had someone helping me in seconds.  Gerald was super helpful when he called to setup shipping.  They have products that are hard to find at very reasonable prices.  If you are into mycology and need a Flow Hood, look no further.<//text>

Terra has not supported their products.  We purchased over $50,000 of individual stainless fan filter units from them.  Most if not all of them have FAILED independent HEPA testing.  Leaks in the housing, leaks around the filter seal, etc.  Bad engineering design with no mechanical way to ensure filter seal.

Plain and simple, these do not meet the ISO or Grade classification their website claims.  Then good luck getting them to do anything else except send you some silicone caulk and say good luck.  Our production has been shut down because of these issues for months.  We have called and emailed multiple times.  Customer service doesn't seem to think this is urgent enough to answer the phone or call back within 24 hrs...

As you can see in the picture below.  Terra sent out multiple filters without doing particulate testing to verify integrity.  The only testing they do is differential testing, not filter integrity testing. You can see in the picture below when we analyzed the filter media further, there were tears in the media.  They did not offer to replace the almost 10 filters we found issues with....  We have been forced to trash the filters and start from scratch with another manufacturer.

Bottom line is low quality and bad customer service is what we have experienced.   They don't stand behind their products.</Text>

Terra Universal has a great set up! I was shopping for a fan filter unit/HEPA filter, and one of my colleagues suggesting checking with them. They have an online chat function, so you don't have to pick up a phone if you don't want to. Gerald was the one that helped me. He was quick, knowledgeable, and pleasant. I would recommend Terra Universal to anyone!<//Text>

<Review>I was looking at their website (as I had stumbled across a video of some of their products available) and had some questions about particular differences in some products that were all very similar by design. I reached out to their customer service chat and was quickly linked with the sales rep named Mitun, who was very straight forward and directly answered all of my questions in simple fashion. I cannot express how easy they made things. I am very excited to give their company and products soon. If you have any questions about anything they are offering or if having any issues with any products or whatever it may be, I would recommend just reaching out to them. They were very quick and direct. Thanks again.</Review>< Rate>

I worked with Rhey Olmedo for the initial purchase. He required multiple promptings to provide feedback about minor product customization. The drawings provided were helpful. The product was received with loose screws, scratches, and an obvious incorrect drill-hole which had simply been plugged with a bright red plastic plug. The air-tight seals on the doors of the unit were not functioning, and Loren McAdoo is working with me to get this issue fixed. Despite multiple communications I received the incorrect number of replacement parts, which were incorrectly milled. Still working with the company to resolve.

Updated: appropriate replacement parts are not available. Informed to make do with almost-correct parts.< /Text>

Very happy with the soft-wall cleanroom purchased to house analytical equipment in a dusty environment. Four stars instead of five because there were some minor manufacturing defects; ultimately everything fit together and the room suits our needs. Shipping out from Terra's facility took longer than expected but I must say that the crating was excellent. The sales rep and customer service were also extremely responsive and helpful.<//Text>

<Text>I ordered equipment for my small business from them. They have responsive and consistent customer service that contacted me quickly and helped smooth out shipping. Then, when the freight company damaged our equipment during shipping, Mitun (our contact) again was able to expedite replacement of our equipment smoothly and efficiently while being very respectful of our time. Definitely plan to work with them as we expand.</Text><time>1616090300198< /time><Gmap_id>0x80dcd60a40f003f1:0x6dac00be6dc18642<//Gmap_id><Response>None</Response>< username>

My review is mostly reflecting on the customer service experience. Kevin D. and Brandon H. provided excellent customer service to my request for a replacement order. The initial shipment was missing a few units and although it was a few months after receiving the cleanroom at my lab, Kevin and Brandon helped me to replace the missing part in no time. Thank you.< /Text>

<text>So far, so good.  Interacting with Ryan Purisima was great. He was able to provide answers to my questions. I've seen a lot of poor reviews with regard to customer service, so I'm a bit leery of ordering from them. I've read they require cash prepayment, which means the customer has no leverage when the company fails to deliver as promised. I'm hoping the poor reviews are inaccurate or that the company has new and effective policies.< /text>< Response>

Brandon was very helpful and courteous in my follow up call on a parts replacement.  He made sure I had everything I needed for my recently purchased equipment.  Customer service at it's finest, and that is appreciated these days.<//review>

<Text>Loren McAdoo in customer service was extremely helpful in finding some electrical drawings of a passthrough unit I inherited that is from 2001.
I’m amazed it’s still working and that any documentation was available.

We had a laminar flow chamber that worked great but needs some maintenance and new filters. He provided me a quick quote with good info. Great experience and I would recommend this company for laboratory purchases, Thanks again Nathan!< /Review>

Aside from excellent customer service, the staff at Terra Universal is professional and willing to help. I will definitely be a return customer when I expand my operation in the future.< /review>

Additionally, after receiving the unit via Terra's shipping, any questions i had regarding setup were responded to in a timely and very helpful manner.

I would like to document the high level of customer service and engineering expertise of Ryan Purisima. Ryan has been essential in helping us generate a clean air solution for our effort, offering engineering data and explaining best practice strategies to our group. As a result of his guidance, we have quickly come up with an excellent and cost-effective filtered air solution for one of our critical systems. Ryan is a valuable asset as should be recognized as such.< /Review>

Michelle was wonderful! After taking my order over the phone because I was having trouble, she made sure I had all of the information clearly laid out, then kept in touch about the progress, as this was a time-sensitive order. I had issues with the timing of the delivery twice - once because it would be too late, and then because of a possible COVID-19 exposure, it might arrive when the location was closed.  Both times, she handled it professionalism, speed, and exceptionally thoughtful care.  I was so relieved and appreciative - it made this experience a pleasure!.< /text>

<text>Terra Universal customer service representative Edith Rodriguez handled my customer service request professionally and efficiently.  She helped me find the order using my shipping information and quickly understood my request.  Edith followed up with a confirmation email containing an order to send the missing brackets and a timeline for receiving them.  This is a small but important item for me and Edith's service speaks well for her and for Terra Universal.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcd60a40f003f1:0x6dac00be6dc18642<//gmapID></record>

The dedication to customer support through out the order process was top notch.  The team communicated with us on the status of our shipment.  When there was an issue with one of the devices ordered, Customer Service Representative, Brandon Herrerias saw to our needs and quickly shipped us a replacement unit, hassle free.</Text>

Had a wonderful experience with Terra Universal - after working with Taso Giokas, I felt extremely comfortable with the ordering process. He was extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer all questions with confidence and clarity. Will definitely be recommending them again and cannot wait to receive my equipment!</Text>

It is really a pleasure to have a live person handle a transaction with a few moving pieces from start to end.  Nathan Duong was from the start invested in my order, and was very proactive from initial contact through engineering drawings to order placement through shipping and even confirming delivery.  We had a ridiculous schedule, Terra met it, and Nathan was directing it the whole time.< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>We are a Pharma testing lab in New Jersey and needed a clean room for our expanding business.

We are extremely pleased with the installation.  It is not only fully functional, but looks terrific - lots of compliments.  We had signed a contract with another firm previously, but opted out when we saw the Terra Universal product.  It looked WAY better and was actually less expensive.  Ray San Filippo of TU was extraordinarily helpful during the design stage - which was very important as this was our first clean room.

The clean room we purchased included the walls, ceiling, FFUs, lights, pass thru and doors.

For the installation we basically created a custom unit out of standard parts sourced from Home Depot, Amazon, etc.  We chose to do the electrical, magnahelics, UVs and external air handling ourselves.

Any competent contractor should be able to do the install without any problems or previous clean room experience.  In 3 days  we were ready for certification.< /text>< pictures>

Right off the bat, Rodrigo was super helpful. I wasn't 100% certain on what I needed, but he helped me determine the correct parts and even pointed out a couple of items that I had forgotten to include. I will definitely be coming back to Terra Universal if everyone is like Rodrigo!</text>

If you want a great customer experience, Gerald is your guy. I had a lot of questions, and he answered them professionally and in a timely manner. He's a great asset to the company. I've heard great things about Terra Universal and that's only been bolstered by my interaction with Gerald.< /Review>

<Text>I had the opportunity to work with Richard Concepcion with a purchase. I had many questions about our order, at which he was able to answer all of them. He was very polite and respectful on the phone. He was very quick to respond to emails and phone calls. The experience working with Richard was a pleasant one and If I ever need another order placed with Terra Universal I will make sure and contact him to help me. Thank you Richard!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd60a40f003f1:0x6dac00be6dc18642</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Just a quick note to point out how professional and helpful Nathan Duong was in handling our recent glovebox purchase.  His knowledge of the product line was key in us ordering the right product, while his dedication in following through with our order--even after its speedy delivery--is the reason we'll be buying from Terra Universal again in the future.</review>

<text>1 star - Hardware.  A Series 400 glove box purchased two years ago has had numerous problems forming a seal at every door.  Flimsy construction, neverending headache.  5 stars - Customer Service.  Have worked with Kevin over the past year to find various solutions to the multiple problems encountered.  At every step he's been knowledgeable and extremely responsive.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Gerald helped me with purchasing biosafety cabinets, and I couldn’t be more thankful! He is exceptionally knowledgeable, which was much appreciated, because I was initially very indecisive about what to purchase. Very kind, professional, great customer service. In regards to the cabinets, I’m quite happy with the product. I highly recommend Terra Universal!<//text>

I want to thank Terra Universal for their expediency and efficiency during our purchase of 7 soft wall clean rooms for our pharma plant. Ray San Filippo was a pleasure working with and was a huge part in getting these to our manufacturing plant in Georgia. The soft wall clean rooms made it to our site exactly when Ray said they would arrive and we will be able to begin our clinical trials in just a few short days. I would also like to thank the entire Terra team for making this happen. Our facility will definitely be using Terra in the future.<//review>

I had him jumping through hoops and he always was so pleasant and kind in all our correspondence . I think one of the best things was that he didn't make it all about the business. He added a personal touch of caring, asking about my day & keeping it light hearted. My experience with him directly, makes me want to encourage our company to do more business with Terra Universal. Hats off to him. He definitely sets the standard.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Ryan Purisima helped me throughout the quoting and ordering process. He was very helpful and a pleasure to work with. Terra Universals payment terms(up front in full) made it difficult, but the job got done.</Review>

I called customer service looking for a specific pass-thru model's cutsheet and I was impressed with the responsiveness! I usually dread having to call customer service but Kevin was able to get me the cutsheet within 15 minutes of getting off the phone with him. If only all customer service experiences could be as great as this one.</Text>

I placed an order with Taso Giokas and he was extremely helpful and responsive. We had a lot of questions regarding how many HEPAs we'd need and the differences between the various models and he was great at responding to my messages quickly. After my initial purchase I even contacted him again regarding the purchase of additional accessories and not only was he very responsive he offered it to us at a discount! Down the road if I have any additional needs I will definitely be reaching out to him directly. I definitely recommend him. :)</Review>

Our company is working very hard trying to help in many ways during the COVID-19 pandemic. We needed 3 clean rooms to be built  and shipped as soon as possible. I worked with Nathan Duong throughout the whole process and he was instrumental in the rapid turnaround time that we really needed. Thanks Nathan and the Terra Team !!!</review>

Attempted to buy a FFU from terra to my Residential home, just to find out they ship buy freight for Quality Assurances. Upset about me not being able to receive my product I replied to the email stating how I wasn't aware of this and needed to know what to do now. I was promptly emailed by Ryan Purisima, engineer and sales rep. Who wanted to make this right, giving me his number and being asked to call him. We then talked about possible shipping solutions and even called contacts of his to get something set up via padded ground van.

In the end it was too much money for me to go that route but I was in complete understanding of their business/shipping. So even though I'm looking into alternatives to get a FFU, the response time and amount of communication I received, goes a long way in terms of business.

Would recommend buying from if you have means to receive freight.</text>

We purchased a clean room from Terra Universal and Nathan was the person that helped us.  The whole process went very well, and we received the clean room promptly despite the fact the procurement process expanded over the holidays.  Nathan was very timely in replying emails and phone calls.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Ryan was my sales associate, and boy was he something. The way he helped me find things and the way he helped me search for the exact thing I needed. Its almost incomprehensible. I thought this was going to be a difficult thing, but I was dead wrong. I wasn't trying to buy a ton of stuff, and I am not a business, so he helped me navigate the difficulties of ordering from a consumer perspective. I felt like more than a customer... I felt like family. Now I will soon have all the clean room equipment I need, and some great memories to boot. Thank you Ryan.</text>< pictures>

I have previously had difficult experiences when working with Terra. I was expecting the same when reaching out to them this week. Luckily for me Kyle Williamson was the sales associate that answered my request! Kyle responded quickly, immediately understood my unusual ask, and got back to me with when my replacement parts for a custom cart would ship  within hours.</review>

Worked with Michelle Bua; Super understanding in terms of clearing my misunderstanding of the product and managed to confirm product specifications as well as the reasoning behind them. Definitely recommend the Live Chat as a quick response system!< /Text>

Kyle engaged me online and provided me the necessary manuals, plus answered my questions in a complete and prompt fashion.  Excellent customer service!  Thank you Kyle!!</review>

The service and product delivered were great.  We had a minor shipping delay but it ended up working out in the end.  The support that Rick Watson offered after delivery has been amazing.  He was speedy in his reply and sent additional information which was very helpful.  Now that the cleanroom is setup we are hitting number below the ISO8 mark which is awesome.  Thanks all.<//text>

I really do appreciate her professionalism and kindness whether on the phone or email.  Great job Monica!< /review>< GmapID>

Horrendous service and communication.  As a customer who had not ordered from them in 5 years, they required we pay upfront to place the order.  1/2 the order was then delivered as promised, but we are still waiting on a table that was quoted to be in stock and to be delivered with the clean booths AND the 2 additional backordered tables.  I've sent 3 emails and left 3 voice messages in the past 7 days and they are not responding even though their office has said our sales rep Kyle W. is working but in a meeting.  I would not recommend this company for anyone looking to bring in cleanroom equipment.< /review>

Working with Terra Universal is seamless.  Requested quote, received quote, and placed order in a timely fashion.  Worked direct with Chelsy.  Chelsy is prompt, courteous, and patience (with me), answered all questions.  Great customer service.  Always nice to work with a vendor rep. that treats you like a customer.< /Review>

I appreciated her timely responses via email and had all my questions answered. Unfortunately shipping was going to be too expensive so i did not proceed with the purchase. Great company though!</review>< pictures>

We had ordered an item from Terra Universal back in December and were told it was expected to ship on December 18th.  As of January 6th, we did not received or hear anymore regarding this item.  I called our sales rep twice, left message and received no response.  I then called customer service and spoke to Brandon Herrerias.  He said he would check on it and call me back.  I received an e-mail telling me he would follow up on 1-7-20 and get me an answer.  I received an e-mail from Brandon telling me the item was shipped.  Brandon did a great job checking on this and giving us the good news that it was shipped.   He certainly went above and beyond what our salesperson didn't do.  Thank you Brandon!!!!< /text>

Building our clean room from scratch and Kamran S. was a huge help as we had a ton of questions.  In fact, I drove out for a plant tour with my contractor so my guy could visualize how all the parts would work together and it went great.

We had some missing items in our shipment but Kamran was on it and everything was resolved promptly.  We are still opening pallets and he is great with any questions I have (there are many).

Have no problem in continuing doing business with Terra Universal as long as Kamran is my prime contact.< /Review>

We purchased a cleanroom from Terra, and imagine my dismay when some of the ceiling ties were missing!  I was certain this was going to be a pain, but Jose De La Roca in customer service got back to me almost immediately, had the missing part in the mail the next day and I received them in my lab shortly after.  I was very impressed at the fast turnaround in service!< /review>

I have seen Terra Universal catalogs for quite some time in all the laboratories I have directed. Never paid attention to them. Other more familiar companies attracted my attention. I just completed my first purchase with Terra Universal. I am delighted and extremely satisfied with the knowledge and superb customer service I received from Chelsy.  She was exceptional! Rest assured that my future purchases will be with Terra Universal and in particular with Chelsy. Thanks!< /Review>

<review>We have used Terra for several of our lab upgrades related to making cleaner spaces with clean room curtains instead of hard walls. They have always been a pleasure to work with on the order and highly responsive on adjustments if the order was not satisfied properly. In the most recent order, we forgot to add one small item onto the bigger order and RJ was gracious to roll it into our bigger order without any consequences to us. We much appreciated his effort to do this for us.</review>< pictures>

Miriam Valdez is a great asset to your company.

We ordered some large items from Terra with a rush delivery.
We received the items on time because she made sure we did.

Miriam is polite, always professional and knowledgeable.
If she says "I'll call you with that information" you can take that to bank because she will, and that is important to me the customer.

Always a pleasure working with her because she cares.< /review>

This has been one of the worst customer service experience I’ve had in a long time. We had ordered an air shower for our facility and we were told an arrival date of 11/18. When that date came and went and no word from our rep, Eddie Herrerias, we emailed and called looking for an update. I understand that Eddie was on paternity leave, however, I had to speak to multiple people to try to get an answer and was promised many call backs but never received any. First I was told 11/27 and then after calling to confirm, we were told they still had to contact their manufacturing team for a date. We only FINALLY got a response for a ESD date of 12/18 two days ago. But after 3 emails asking for clarification, we come to find that it’s just the date for shipment and not for delivery. At this point we have had to delay construction and pay fees due to delaying our inspection because of their poor communication. Just because we have paid thousands for a product doesn’t mean you can provide non-existent customer service.<//Text>

Working with RJ Olmendo to purchase equipment for our plant has been straightforward and enjoyable.  He is quick to respond to any problems I am having and provides all the relevant documentation and information I may need from him.

Additionally, a filter was damaged upon shipment to our facility and Terra was quick to replace the item under their warranty. The replacement filter passed inspection and now the equipment is in operation.</Text>

I have worked with Terra for several years now and purchased several of their clean lab products. All have met or exceeded my expectation. I've dealt mostly with Ray, he's amazing. Understands the products, very responsive, and is always willing to help!</Review>

I sent him the information on the model and although it was an older model, he took the time to look up the correct part that we needed.  I appreciated it because it would have taken me forever to find, not to mention it saved us money in replacing the part rather than buying an entirely new unit.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I just completed the first purchase with Terra for my employer. While our small order ensures we weren't the biggest customer they've done business with, we were treated well and with patience and fairness. Chris answered all of our questions (there were many, given this was our first purchase of the kind), and he even went out of his way to do some extra research on shipping options for us. As we scale up as a company, we will certainly keep Terra on our radar for our clean environment needs.< /Text>

<review>John Briggs did a great job helping us through the specification and purchase of our first clean room. I highly recommend him. The review would have been 5 stars but the delivery of the room was rescheduled by TUI a couple of times and ended up about two weeks late. We just received our shipment yesterday and it was well packed and the components appear to be high quality.< /review>< pics>

We are wanting to open a USP 797/800 compliant pharmacy and got sticker shock for a build out of a clean room. With a potential savings of 60K and portability in the future, we cannot wait to put our order in (after architect reviews our space requirements).  I am thankful the (higher bidder) told me about this company as he knew I was questioning the dollar amount. Thank you Mark!< /review>< resp>

<Review>Miriam was extremely helpful, responsive and professional in assisting us through a very challenging project in which the end user, as well as myself, was very unfamiliar with pass through products, options and project specific requirements. She willingly guided us through the learning process as well as many rounds of revised pricing and product shop drawings.  Her attentiveness to the needs of the project was greatly appreciated.

<review>I called customer service for Terra Universal and was promptly greeted by Miriam who quickly answered my questions regarding a pass thru I am specifying for a project. I cannot praise enough how wonderful it is for a company to have people such as Miriam who understand their products and can answer questions on the spot rather than being transferred to multiple people and still not getting to a solution. Thank you Miriam for answering all my questions!</review>< userid>

My service rep, Miriam, was able to quickly advise me on the best units for my application, discuss the options available, and send additional information to support decision making.  I had a quote within an hour and was able to present a wealth of information to internal clients the same morning.  The products are high quality, well-designed, safe, and very durable.  Lead times are great and the pricing is outstanding.< /Text>

Purchased a modular cleanroom last year, and it has performed outstanding for all of our purposes. In addition, the support has been timely and effective on all fronts. Recently - we are interested in purchasing another, and Chris Taylor has been very helpful with deciding all the various options and fast turnaround time with quotes. Much recommended.</Text>

<Text>Hello,

I work for a large defense company that has several clean room type of environments.  My Terra representative is Miriam Valdez.  I have been working with Miriam for over a year now and she is fantastic.  I can send her what I am looking for or what I have found and get a quote within 24 hours.  I tend to have to change my quotes which can get frustrating but Miriam is always happy to help me and never ignores me 100 emails.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Purchased a modular cleanroom last year, and it has performed outstanding for all of our purposes. In addition, the support has been timely and effective on all fronts. Recently - we are interested in purchasing another, and Chris Taylor has been very helpful with deciding all the various options and fast turnaround time with quotes. Much recommended.< /review>< pics>

<time>1472077957597</time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>I am a representative from HP Incorporated and work from our Corvallis Oregon site. I have had no luck getting a competitive company to respond to my calls when looking for a 2 step platform product in order for operators to use to load new tool in our clean room. I tried for 2 weeks. Today, my Engineer discovered a product through Terra Universal Inc. that better met our standards but we needed alterations on measurements of step height, width, depth and railing. Much to my surprise, when I called the number listed on line, a very kind sounding, English speaking operator answered and quickly transferred me to a young man named Ernest Miranda who answered immediately, confirmed that my alterations would be simple, and sent me an email quote with all of the needed alterations included by lunch time the very same day! Time is critical to get this equipment as the new tool will be released to production soon. Ernest was very accommodating, answered ALL of my questions and repeated back to me all alterations to verify his information was correct before he got with his Engineers. I also appreciated that he called me back once to let me know about OSHA standards for railing height so we would be sure to be in safety standard conformance with OSHA. This probably cut out complications for us later. Thanks again Ernie! We will certainly look forward to more business with your company because of your customer service skills!<//Text>< pics>

I have recently received fantastic service From Miriam Magana of Terra Universal. Miriam was extremely responsive and courteous in compiling a complicated set of quotes for our organization recently, more impressive given the number of late changes we asked her to make for us, so to meet our business requirements. I greatly appreciated her efforts.<//review>

I learned of this company through a door vendor we use in Georgia.  We initially had another vendor slated to supply our needs but they fell through at the last minute.  I contacted Miriam at Terra and she was quick to react to my needs.  Although I was on a restricted time frame, she was able to pull together her resources and take care of my problem.
I appreciate the fact that she didn't look for the problems in my request but instead stayed positive and found solutions that met my needs.
Hooray for good customer service!<//review>

While I haven't had a chance to actually use my product yet, so this is only a review of the service I have experienced so far.

Worked for this company. I would recommend that no business or unemployed person get involved with this company because it operates as a sweatshop. Employees are regularly punished for whatever reason. Management thrives under the culture of punishment... I even heard they adopted a strike system and put it in the employees’ paycheck. It’s been a while but I have kept in touch with former employees so they confirmed information of the such. Very political environment too. I would definitely be skeptical of their “favorable” reviews because, as in most poorly performing companies, they are trying to boost their online image for sales. Do your research and look at their news coverage... not too favorable.</Text>

Buyer beware.  Look around at all the other reviews.  This company only accepts cash (although they claim to take credit cards.)  The reality is that their deliverables (timing, availability, etc) are all very poor so taking your cash means you no means of repercussion beyond filing a lawsuit once they fail to do what they say.

Stay away from this company - they are offering nothing you can't find elsewhere with better pricing and more trustworthy service.</Text>

< review>
I am a current PhD candidate in a new lab at Lehigh University that is constantly building things. Needless to say we have come across countless sales engineers and have had many bad experiences. Terra Universal is one of my favorite companies I have come across. I've met three people in particular that are absolute gems:

John Briggs was a huge help to one of our undergraduate students (which can be a challenge in itself) and was very knowledgeable about the options available to us for inert glove boxes. He also quoted our system very quickly and even re-quoted in just as short a time.

Miriam Magaña probably received the brunt of my live chat bugging and was able to stay on top of multiple questions, firing answers right back as I typed them. She was also extremely kind which is always welcome.

This can also be said of my latest live chat experience with Chris Taylor who was able to wrap up the remaining round of questions we had with just as much ease as his co-workers. Also a very nice fellow.

That all being said, bravo to Terra Universal. They are a refreshingly helpful and expedient company experience in a world full of many other companies with a far lower regard for customer experience, helpfulness and smart recommendations.< /review>

My experience with Mark at Terra Universal was awesome! I had a customer wanting a modular softwall cleanroom and had no idea where to go for one. I Googled it and it brought me to the Terra Universal site and I used the instant message feature on their site. Mark was very responsive and was able to point out the necessary requirements that my customer needed. We were able to narrow it down quickly and I had a quote sent to me in no time! I wish all of my suppliers were as responsive and as quick as Mark was. A+ service and support and I will highly recommend their products to my colleagues.<//text>

The company's customer (technical) support sucks. I contacted them for help on our Nitrogen generator we got from them, and they said over phone they would email some videos for help but I never got that email. After 5 days, I again contacted them, and they only got back to me after seeing this review.  By the way, the their chat (general) support is good, its just their technical team which really pissed me off.<//Review>

<text>Saying it lightly, this was worst experience we have ever had with vendor.  I'm not even sure the experience we had with Terra Universal would even measure up to the one star review.  They ask for payment up front and then prior to shipping without even providing a status of the finished product. They consistently miss ship dates on critical items.  They do a horrible job communicating the status of their orders and are constantly late with no excuse.  They don't return calls even after they have your money very readily.  You should be desperate if you give these people money.  Totally unreliable and disappointing.  I never feel compelled to publically place bad feedback on anyone except in this situation.  They are that difficult to work with.  We have yet to receive our late order and are extremely concerned the item will not meet spec once we have paid for 75% of it.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>
{'time': 1442259952018, 'text': "Dear David,\n\nThank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

<text>I had ordered a kneeling pad. I initially called and spoke with Ray S. who was -0- help, gave excuses why the product which was promised by 7/26 was now expected 9/1??? Said "overwhelming demand" talked over me and was totally not listening to me. THEN I signed in and spoke on line with CHRIS who was very helpful. He agreed to try to get me a better ship date which is ALL I was asking the first associate who was too busy talking to hear a word I was saying. We all have bad days, but seriously, take it out elsewhere, have some ice cream and chill.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Ernest Miranda of Terra Universal Inc is Hands Down the Best!  We have been using Terra Universal Inc. since 2011 and they are without a doubt the Leading Manufacturer of Critical Environment Enclosures and Furnishings!  Many of our client's specification are for Terra Universal Laboratory Equipment and Laboratory Furnishings.

Ernie goes the extra mile in ensuring that you understand everything when processing an order through Terra Universal.  The Customer Service is Simply Outstanding and we will continue to do business with them!

It is understandable that Terra Universal has such a Long-Standing Reputation of Excellence!  Ernie is an Employee that ensures that Terra Universal Customer's needs are met.

This is Shulman Industries, Inc. way of saying we greatly appreciate Terra Universal treating us with Value!  We found the Customer Service that was extended by Terra Universal and especially Ernie Outstanding!

Thanks Again!

We have ordered from Terra Universal randomly for several years and have always been treated like a "long-term" customer. We recently purchased some equipment using a fairly generic online purchase request. The response time was less than 24 hours and we immediately were put in touch with a sales rep, Kayvon S. Kayvon was very easy to work with and gave real time status updates re: our order. We will continue to look to Terra U. for future needs.< /text>

<review>Worked for this company. I would recommend that no business or unemployed person get involved with this company because it operates as a sweatshop. Employees are regularly punished for whatever reason. Management thrives under the culture of punishment... I even heard they adopted a strike system and put it in the employees’ paycheck. It’s been a while but I have kept in touch with former employees so they confirmed information of the such. Very political environment too. I would definitely be skeptical of their “favorable” reviews because, as in most poorly performing companies, they are trying to boost their online image for sales. Do your research and look at their news coverage... not too favorable.<//review><name>Adrian</name>< Rate>

I had an online chat with Kayvon Sadaghiani and it was the easiest, best chat experience I've ever had, and that is really tough to admit because I'm not a fan of online chats. He was great, very knowledgeable and got the info I need here at JPL in a fast, professional manner. If all of your employees are like that then I will definitely be back many times!<//Review>

Miriam went above and beyond helping me track down information that I did not have on an old purchase someone else at our company had made. In no time at all, she sent me everything I needed on our special order and sent the quote shortly afterwards for replacement parts. I was expecting this was going to be a chore but she made this so easy for me. Jean Kapturowski at Scott Safety</Review>

Kamran sadaghiani has done a great job at providing prompt service for our urgent orders. He was very helpful with his technical background and getting us the delivery timeframe and pricing that we needed for our project.

The updated Standards released by USP for 797/ 800, and NAPRA, require many modifications and changes in thought processes when outfitting clean-rooms. Taso, at Terra Universal, was extremely helpful and accommodating. Our questions were answered and our needs were met. The information and quotes were accurate and reasonable.
Thank you Taso for the excellent customer service and working closely with me to acquire the proper equipment for our new modular clean-room.< /review>

<Review>Taso, my sales rep was very friendly and knowledgeable from the very beginning of my initial consultation.  If he didn't know an answer, he didn't hesitate to ask others for assistance.

< Review>
We needed an explosion-proof fume hood for our company. Kamran Sadaghiani did an excellent job guiding me to the right products and working very professionally to customize the unit that would fit our needs. Kamran is very knowledgeable and has great communication skills. The whole ordering process has been pleasant and I would definitely recommend Kamran and Terra.</Review>

This is in reference to Order Confirm No. 215726 . I called to place an order for some Casters , and was helped by Miriam Magana . She answered my various questions about product description , availability , taxes ( it was a US gov't c/c purchase) etc. Miriam worked with me to ensure that I would received the ordered items in the timeframe that would meet the needs of my organization , and the order was finalized in a short period of time. I appreciated her combination of attention to detail and professionalism , in conjunction with the fact that she was very easy to work with , and talk to. And , I promptly received an e-mailed Order Confirmation , shortly after we ended our conversation.
It was a great , and easy purchasing experience
Thanks a lot.

< review>
I recently made an order for two units of Humidity Module Model 1911-30B through web chat with Rhey Olmedo from Terra Universal. Rhey actually recommended me to order this model once he knows my intended application. He was then able to quote, process the payment and ship the products to us right on time so I can carry one of the unit to our factory oversea the following day! I highly recommend using Rhey for equipment purchase from Terra Universal.

Last week, I came back to the website of Terra Universal and looked for the information on the Nitrowatch system for a total solution of controlling the humidity level of my desiccator. I got a little bit confused because there are changes to the website of Terra Universal. Fortunately, Nathan Duong came online to assist me. He is so competent with this humidity control product that he was able to read my mind! When I mentioned there is a wrong cable that I purchased a year ago with the Nitrowatch, he immediately knew what I meant and offered to send a replaced cable along with the purging controller. This really save me lots of time. I highly recommend the potential users to get intouch with Nathan for your equipment need at Terra Universal. He knows his products well and is very friendly and polite and responsive to work with.</review>

TerraUniversal continues to be my "go to" source for laboratory refrigeration.  They offer a wide range of products and the knowledgeable sales associates guide you through the selection process with ease.  My latest RFP with Thomas Nakamoto  led to a purchase due to his rapid response to my questions.  I highly recommend TU and specifically Thomas...it is a superior combination to save time and many on your projects.< /Review>

I work with lots of engineers so when they gave me a quote presented by Terra Universal, I made the phone call and got a hold of Rhey (RJ). It didn't take long at all for RJ to help me with my order. The transaction went smooth and his customer service was also excellent.</text>

When we started our clean room project with Terra Universal I knew only an area of our production process and a class of the clean room required. After consulting with Rhey Olmedo at TU, many things were clarified. We designed a draft of the clean room and received an estimate. Important for us was seismic stability of the clean room since our production is located in a seismic zone. Update of the drawings and production of the clean room was on time, and we received it as scheduled. Thanks Rhey for your help in all aspects of our clean room project!<//review>

<review>Miriam Magaña, Sales Associate with Terra Universal was awesome today in helping me.  She was very friendly, professional and sweet.  She went out of her way to send me engineer drawings to clarify my item details as purchased.  She even personally located the production manager to answer important technical questions that I had.  I could have not had better service then from her! Miram represents Terra Universal Inc. very well!!!

Very bad experience as an employee working there for 2 months. I was a welder there and was harassed by supervisors all the time, they make u clock out to go to the rest room, have a camera by the rest room and you are being watched with cameras all day. The wages are a joke, $12 hr for Welders and most guys make $10hr. They don't care about the employees at all cause they can get any young guy for minimum wage off the street. This man that owns the company has people brain washed and continues to treat people like if they were illegal immigrants which he used to hire before. A lot of employees there don't know their rights and some already getting legal advice about what goes on there.</Review>

We recently procured a 800 sqft Class 10k clean room from Terra that will be used as a production facility for the biggest high energy silicon sensor tracker in the world. Miriam Magana was the sales associate that handled our order and she was a pleasure to deal with. Since this clean room is procured by and installed at a National Lab there is enough red tape to drive anyone crazy. Miriam was always courteous and handled the long and tedious procurement process with patience and grace. As always with projects of this size there will be glitches, things missing, etc., etc. Miriam and the other people at Terra made sure that these hurdles could be taken quickly and that missing parts were overnighted to us.
It's been a pleasure to be dealing with Terra in general and Miriam in particular. I would not hesitate to do business with them in the future.<//text>

I use Terra Universal for all my Cleanroom needs.  I own an e-liquid company and we built our own cleanroom and could not of done it without Terra Universal and their team.  My sales rep Is Zachary and he is the best.  he always has an answer for my issues and they also have the best prices around.  I have bought my FFU fans, Cleanroom Air Conditioner, Air Curtains, Shelving, UV lights, and more.  The best prices around with the best service around.  Ask for Zachary!!!<//review>

<Time>1463807766099< /Time><rating>5< /rating><Review>TerraUniversal is no doubt on pf the best company. I always found solution to all of my cleanroom related issues. Workers, employee are definitely assets of an organization.
Similarly,taking about Alicia A. Nunes, gives confidence as whenever I sent query regarding modular cleanroom, she replied me well and to the point of my concern. Each and every time Alicia responded me well, I always found her, helping and dedicated to my concerns even when requirements were changing several time from my side that impacted quotation and other pre-requisites. Alicia is well informed and responsive and keep the client in contacts. Doing busines with Terra thru Alicia is great and memorable experience.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>Wanted to take a minute and provide positive comment about the products Cevians LLC has purchased from Terra Universal.  Perhaps more importantly, the customer service has been excellent.  We had a critical project that required softwall cleanroom and we were on a tight time schedule.  Working directly with Ernest MIranda we were able to navigate through several technical issues and meet our customer schedule.  It was a challenging project and we had a few changes and surprises along the way but working closely with Ernie Cevians was able to produce a quality product, on time and on budget.  Great job Terra Universal!<//review>< rate>

For my is new to speak and to buy the two "cleanrooms"  but terra and Miriam have made that it be  easier to understand and to implement it in our  plant.
