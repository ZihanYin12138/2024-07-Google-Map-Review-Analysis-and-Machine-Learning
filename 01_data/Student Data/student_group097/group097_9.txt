The sales team at Land Rover Sacramento are top notch. They took care of me from the moment I arrived. They weren't pushy at all. I enjoyed my experience and would recommend this location to anyone who is in the market for a new Land Rover.<//Review>

Our appointment was on Thurs morning at 9. We live 5.5 hours away. This was the 4th time into the service department for the same problem with our car. We made a mini trip out of it so they could work on the car. Said we would be back Monday to pick up, We called Monday morning. They said it hadn't even been looked at yet. We were very upset & drove the 5.5 hours home in the loaner car. The service man we talked to didn't even apologize. They did however fix it (we hope) by the next day & I requested they deliver it to  us since we we're now home already. At that point the service writer did thank us for our patients. That helped.</Review>

I took my 2008 Range Rover Land Rover Supercharged in for service and to have a oil leak and tire pressure light checked out. The rep pulled up the VIN# and began asking me questions pertaining to the cars history. He began asking where did I buy the car, and  who completed the last oil change? He then goes on to say that there was a recall on the vehicle (faulty air bag) that hadn't been fixed. I explained to him that the recall repair was completed by Range Rover Rocklin a little over a month from the time he checked it. According to him they hadn't put it in the system to show it was cleared. He then goes on to say if I wanted his service people to check out my car it would cost $195.00 to diagnose each area and that's not included in the work had I got it done! He then says I want your business but it might be better off if you took your car to the shop who last done the work. I took my car to the dealership  trusting that they could fix the problem better than a non range rover certified mechanic.  I feel this rep saw me as being a black man driving a nice vehicle and wanted to price gauge me. I would be curious to know what other people have been
charged for a diagnosis, yet how many other black persons have been treated the same...< /text>

< review>
I visited Land Rover Sacramento from the SF Bay Area July 5th. We called prior to handle all the numbers and financial aspects before we arrived so we didn’t have to play the typical games of a car dealership. Upon arrival we were met by Peirce a friendly young gentleman who let us know that he has worked for Land Rover 1 month. Peirce had the Land Rover we wanted waiting and he had us test drive the car and went through all the specs. We went inside to do all the paperwork and all seemed easy breezy, well at the very ends after 3 hours that was suppose to be 2 hours and ALL THE SIGNING OF THE PAPERWORK, we went to pay and the finance guy Steve was charging us almost 5k over what we had agreed and he knew what he was doing and so did Peirce yet both acted like they had no idea. SHADY AF but I was not the least bit surprised. While I was signing the paperwork Steve never said one word about how great Land Rover was but boy oh boy did he go on about his brand new super cool BMW X5 M series. Also the business was messy an empty gallon of bottle was laying on the floor, bathrooms were were the most disgusting bathrooms ever. First Toilet was sprayed with diarrhea, garbage baskets were overflowing with garbage and garbage was on the floor, no paper towels or soap. Seriously the establishment was not at all what Land Rover should represent in my opinion however I’m not surprised about the salesperson or finance guys bait and switch at the end. Overall, did we get a deal no, Did I expect to get a deal no but what I did expect was respect of being straightforward and at least not talk about how great another car brand that is different from where you work and at least have the facilities on point and clean. Oh and offer your customers water at least for crying out loud. I have purchased many High end cars in my lifetime and this Land Rover dealership was pretty classless. Peirce was perfectly fine to be fair. Would I go back eh ok yes but I was in a super good mood yesterday and typically I’m always annoyed and judgy so we shall see when I’m up for another car;)</review>

My experience here was 5stars. I was working with Jessica, Phillip, and Rick in sales, sales leader and finance. Most appreciated was their respect for you and your time and not a hard push on upsells. The  car I got was in great overall condition and at a good price. This has been my best car dealer experience. Note this is for Niello Jaguar Land Rover Sac, I see some low reviews mixed in here for a different dealer.<//Text>

They were knowledgeable, courteous and responsive to all my questions regarding my Land Rover acquisition. Due to the current climate and being a new mom, it’s hard to find time to go to dealerships. Shane was so accommodating by driving to me so I can explore cars from the comfort of my own home. It was a very comfortable and a stress free transaction. I truly felt as though he had my best interest in mind. Rick handled the financing and he was respectful and operated with integrity throughout our entire transaction. He was able to do everything remotely via phone call. I literally signed the paperwork in my dinning room with my house slippers on. It was fantastic! If you’re at all on the fence or wanting to explore options at Land Rover Sacramento, give Shane and Rick a call you will not be disappointed!<//text>< pics>

Recently leased a Range Rover Evoque.  Was comparing several models and chose this car because of the options and handling. Very sporty to drive and beautiful on the inside!  Excellent sales and customer service experience. Turned around a month later and bought a pick up for my husband because we knew the quality of the vehicle would be top notch.  Highly recommend Frank and Gina! Made the car purchase process enjoyable!<//Text>

Salesperson was nice until I drove off the lot with my new car. After I bought my car they never followed up with me. And when I had issues with my purchase and returned later, they acted like I was bothering them. And gave poor customer service. Maybe because I'm a nine-to-five guy who was buying a used Land Rover. I guess you have to be some rich Tycoon buying a brand new Jaguar or Land Rover to get a little more attention.
💥Update... The sales manager reached out to me and we resolved the issue 😊< /Text>

Dropped my vehicle off at the service department, started off a little rocky, ended up great!  Service advisor Jenn was very helpful and went above and beyond to give us excellent customer service!!!   They even arraigned to pick up the loaner vehicle and drop my vehicle off to me at home, even though I live 30 miles away.

I was involved in a  3 car pileup and my car was totaled.   took me couple months to find the right car and came across a beautiful (burgandy) honda crv. I wanted to do a big down payment and or cash out instead (cash on on hand). Well that was my big mistake.  the financing manager was so aggressive with me, he didnt want to hear anything I had to say and got very pushy. Demanded I write a check for full price instead of maybe working out a bargain.  Yea! No thanks. I walked out after he slammed all the paperwork in front of me. I may be just a female  who got unlucky  but i do know as a customer, walk away from dealers who doesnt even want to hear anything a customer have to bargain for.

Update: Nissan Elk grove gave me a good bargain for a rogue! It was alot better deal then the honda! Thanks!< /text>

Land Rover Sacramento gave me a great experience of buying a car!! I highly recommend Spencer. He is very kind and helpful, and he valued your business very much. Daniel and Gina helped me go through my paperwork, which was perfect. Land Rover Sacramento's service is superior to other dealerships I have been to. Definitely will go back there!< /Text>

I usually don’t write a review. But the promotion email from Land Rover reminds me to write my recent very bad experience there. I was supposed to test drive Velar and I-Pace, and tried to see whether I can take it home if there was a good deal. But the salesman didn’t treat me as a potential customer and thought I didn’t have enough money to buy their car. But actually I was driving Range Rover there. I previously owned a Land Rover, and I thought I was loyal. But the bad in-store experience totally ruined my loyalty. In the end, I turned to Tesla after I received totally different experience.< /text>

<Text>Had an amazing experience with Maria Contreras at Land Rover Sacramento.  She went above and beyond trying to locate the vehicle I was interested in purchasing.

I am a new customer to Land Rover Sacramento, I have recently ordered a vehicle and am awaiting delivery. As anyone who has ordered a car, I am really anticipating the delivery and have stopped by the location to see what they have in stock and have an organic conversation with someone on their team.
I have visited twice now after my order and have both times been greeted, entertained, and had a wonderful conversation with Maria Contreras, the Business Development Manager at Land Rover Sacramento. In a world of sales people who would say "what is it in for me? This guy already ordered a vehicle, no benefit for me to help", Maria has engaged with me for all my questions and answered all concerns I may have had. Maria is hands down a gold mine, I wouldn't be surprised if she is promoted to General Manager for her customer experience abilities and show of diligence to all customers that arrive. Keep it up Sac Land Rover!</text>

We have been getting our Land Rover serviced here for the last seven years after purchasing it here as well.
The staff are always so nice and professional. Tonya in particular is awesome. She has been our service advisor for some years now.
We always make an appt, she goes over what we need done at that particular time which helps you plan your day. If the vehicle needs to stay longer than expected, you will get a service vehicle until yours is done and ready to take home.
With Land Rover one expects a certain level of expertise and excellence in any car experience. Whether it is in purchasing one or having it serviced, one will get that here. Hence, my humble 5 stars!!!<//text>

So far I've just dealt with the service and parts departments, and I have to say I'm quite satisfied.One service advisor named Tonya took the time to help me look up old service records (for a Jag I bought which had been serviced there), and definitely went above and beyond the call of duty, making me feel very welcome, when I thought I was probably being a pain! The parts guys have always been friendly and helpful, and the sales staff makes it comfortable to just browse the lot.

<Review>Maria and Daniel were responsive, friendly and professional. Maria would get in touch with me minutes after any inquiry and sent me via email detailed and organized information on the car I was interested in. Daniel, the general manager, was easy to speak with and worked with us to figure out the best car for our needs.  This dealership also sends Andrew to your home to review all the ins and outs of the electronics a week or so after you have driven the car.  We are new to the brand and so far feel like life-long fans!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Bought a Range Rover certified from them, had a few problems with it. Daniel the GM of niello Land Rover Sacramento was amazing ... I cannot say enough. They stood behind their product . Tanya in service was awesome. Every time I went in they greeted me as if I was a friend. If I ever had enough money to buy another Range or jaguar they are the place I would purchase from again . They fixed my vehicle in a timely fashion and never had to return for the same issues. It's been running so great the past few months I even kind of miss seeing them! LOL... great company run by great people .. THANK YOU<//text>

<text>Update: we got our car back, a part of the headliner fell off, they didn’t put a seatbelt clip back and both times we messaged Freeman, the one who responded below, nothing was done.

Really disappointed in this dealership. We found a Disco Sport online, negotiated the price, drove down from Reno only to find out there were two significant tears in the headliner. This was never brought to our attention prior to signing the paperwork and we were told, “we never saw these”. Come to find out Land Rover doesn't even allow their dealers to sell a “certified used” with a flaw like this. Anyhow, we are more than 7 months after the fact and we still are struggling to get this resolved. Callbacks never happen from lower levels to management, they have not helped or made anything easy on us, infact, we are driving to Sacramento today to have them try and fix it. Overall a really bad experience that still isn’t finished. I’ll update this review after we take the car in and let you all know how they handle it.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I have bought many cars from many dealers through the years, and I can say that buy your next car from Zach Mongston!  He is a class act and so is Land Rover Sacramento.  Between Andrew Lyon and Zach Mongston and their ability to help me find the car I really wanted, at the price that I felt comfortable with, and the superior customer service,  I can't say enough good things about them. BUY WITH CONFIDENCE!< /review>

I am a serious buyer.  I spent several days working with a sales person on the car I was interested in.  From the beginning, the dealership did not seem particularly interested to earn my business.  The sales manager reluctantly agreed to come close to a price I was asking them to match from another dealer (farther away then Sac).  Then the mgr  wanted to low ball me on my trade, again for the same amount the other dealer was offering.  The attitude I was getting made me ask the sales person if they wanted my business to which she ademently said yes.  She also explained that the Niello brand of dealerships was very reputable and that there would be no funny business.  So I explained that I would come in and assuming the car was accurate to the description, I would buy it.  However it was Thursday and I couldn't get there until Sunday noon.  We agreed... with the understanding that the car could sell before Sunday, which was reasonable.  On Sunday I called the sales person right before I got on the road and she confirmed our appt.  90 mins into my drive I get a call from the sales person.  Someone else was looking at my car and she wasn't sure what would happen.  I was NOT happy.  How could this happen?  She called me 5 mins later after speaking to her sales mgr who told her I should stop for breakfast to give them time to see if this couple would actually purchase the car.  What?? I finally told the sales person I was turning around and going home.  3 hours and $30 in gas wasted!!! I guess the dealer got a better price after all.  There's loyalty for you.  You've heard all of those bad stories about car dealers??  I lived it.  If you go to this dealer, don't ever say you weren't warned.</review><user_name>S</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am happy to share two more great experiences with Niello Land Rover Sacramento.  I completed two transactions in the last two weeks: one on behalf of my colleague who had become frustrated with another dealership (she wanted a new Discovery with specific features) and one for myself (I traded in my RR Sport for a RR Velar).  I worked with Aaron Faulk and Scott Johnson on both purchases, and they did a great job finding the right vehicle for my colleague and arranging a trade with a dealership in Manhattan to get it here.  For my trade-in transaction, they were amazing at securing great financing and making the process painless.  (Special mention to Gina and Andrew who made the signing process so easy, clear, and streamlined.)  This is my 5th vehicle purchase from the Niello family of dealerships personally (between business transactions and helping my friends and family with purchases, I’ve done about a dozen deals with Niello) and I will continue to herald them as the “non-car-dealer” dealership.  They make it such a low pressure, easy, fantastic experience every single time.  I’ve brought business colleagues, friends, and family in to Niello and they’ve all been impressed with how Niello consistently elevates the vehicle buying experience.  Whether you’re in the market for a new or pre-owned vehicle, you’ll be glad you went with Niello.< /Text><user_id>105432143906738742937< /user_id><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

The selection of previously owned Land Rover vehicles between Sacramento and Rocklin was incredible. They do a fabulous job of preparing their first rate inventory to sell.

How do I start to describe one of most knowledge, professional, caring, funny and detailed sales professionals that I have had the pleasure of working with. Zack Mongston was a joy from start to finish.

Zack has wonderful guest service skills and provides an outstanding guest experience for his clients during the entire viewing and purchase experience.

The others on Zack's support team were; Dan, Aaron and Gina.

The entire Niello Land Rover Sacramento team stepped up to make this deal happen, Mahalo...

Thank you Zack for delivering an outstanding Land Rover HSE LUX that we are over the moon happy to own.

Zack is simply the "Best" and Niello Land Rover Sacramento is also simply the "Best"

Zack we will see you in three years...< /text>

LAND ROVER SACRAMENTO - KNOWS HOW TO DELIVER OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!
As a single female looking for her dream car (Range Rover Evoque) I could not have asked for a better sales and customer experience from the initial test drive to closing the deal.  Special mention to ZACH MONGSTON for taking care of me and my million questions with professionalism and a sense of humor, but most of all - for making the experience fun!
I suppose I would expect high quality service from a luxury vehicle company, but the staff truly exceeded my expectations in terms of assistance, concern, personal care and attention.   I am grateful for the expertise and service  I received from all the staff and I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a high end/professional sales experience.
Thank you to Teddy Phan for his help sealing this deal, and to Daniel Giles for drawing me pictures to help me understand how the financials worked!
I absolutely love the vehicle and cannot recommend Land Rover Sacramento enough.  See you all soon for a cuppa and to show off my pimpin' ride!< /review>

<Text>I rarley write reviews, however I feel almost obligated to write a review for Land Rover off Fulton. All I can say is WOW, amazing customer service, friendly and nice people all around. I had some concerns when purchasing the vehicle, a couple of little battle wounds on the vehicle (small almost unnoticibe) they took it in with no questions asked to have it fix and provided me with a rental car. This was my first big purchase and im almost positive I bought the least expensive one on the lot haha, didnt stop the entire staff I worked with to provide me with great service.<//Text><response>None<//response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< time>

I made my fourth purchase from a Niello dealership over the weekend (VW, Audi, Land Rover Rocklin, Land Rover Sacramento). I have found each dealership to be absolutely excellent.

I had such a great experience working with Zach, Sean, and Dan in sales and Gina in finance. I love buying Land Rovers from Brits (and an Irish guy, in this case), as I feel that they have a true passion for what makes Rovers excellent vehicles. This experience did not disappoint. I felt like these guys were my friends throughout the process. I was under the weather this weekend and they truly went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. Gina in finance is a total pro, making the paperwork effortless and simple.

I'd highly recommend any Niello dealership. And if you go to Land Rover Sacramento, make sure to ask for Zach or Sean!</Review>

I asked for a little off the top and ended up with the super short hair. The women was going to charge me full price, but I told her I wasn't going to do that. Not only was she huring mr up to attend one of her appointments that arrived late, but took out her frustration out on me. I went to super cuts across the street and they did much better.</Text>< pics>

Very friendly and very skilled.  They take the time to listen and collaborate with you as to how you want your hair done.  This will now be my local hair cut place.
I used to get my hair cut at a very low priced place but it was always hit or miss.  I guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for.< /Text>

I didn't not get  thinner layer on my back. It's more like a bob cut. I also got hair going down my shirt when she cut my hair with the bib opened.

<text>Worst haircut I've ever gotten. I told the lady exactly what I wanted and 30 seconds later she had to ask me again. Told her finger length on top which requires the use of scissors. When I signed in I didn't give them my address, because I don't want to receive more junk mail. So during the scissor portion of the haircut, she asks "after this can you give me your address? They will send you a $5 off coupon." To which I declined stating I don't want more mail. As soon as I declined, she put down the scissors... got the trimmer to finish the sides, yet she'd only finish about half of the top of my head. Then she realized how bad the top was and got her big clippers and a comb and barely touched the front part of my hair, so while looking straight on it looks ok. Well my hair has dried and wow the right side of my head, the hair is shorter. Then my bangs look like they're doing the wave.

The lady was elderly and had problems walking and standing there to cut my hair, many times she'd either grab and put her weight on me or the chair just to talk around it. I don't think this is the best job for her, and I pray she can retire and live comfortably as soon as possible.

I will never be a customer at this store ever again, and will advise against it to everyone I know.

I highly recommend going across the street, there is a place that is a lot cheaper and a lot better quality. They had a 2 hour wait today and that's the only reason I decided to get elsewhere.(Lesson learned)< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
I highly recommend the Bagelry- I stopped here to buy a dozen bagels for a work staff meeting and had such a pleasant experience. I was in a hurry and not having called in my order I did not expect it to be that fast, but it was! Very reasonable price and delicious fresh bagels -my team loved them. Thank you for your fantastic customer service! It is so refreshing to see someone genuinely care and I hope your business thrives!< /Review>

<Review>First thing to note right now is that they're thankfully still open and running business as usual, however they're just not offering in-house dining just yet. You can order over the phone or walk in for takeout.

The bagels all look heavenly, along with their fresh juices, homemade cream cheese spreads, teas and vietnamese coffees. We ordered 2 sandwiches from their list of most popular options. Lox was my go-to of course and it absolutely didn't disappoint. The number of capers on it was a bit of overkill in my opinion, but it was great nonetheless. My fiance ordered the turkey, bacon, cheese and tomato on a jalapeno bagel. I had to have a bite because I can't turn my head from all things jalapeno. So so good!

We wanted some souvenirs to-go, so we obviously ordered half a dozen bagels, specialty cream cheese, and a vietnamese coffee for the road. This consisted of 3 gourmet bagels, hawaiian, sundried tomato, and spinach parmesan bagels paired with an 8 oz. container of homemade garlic herb cream cheese spread.

I actually dropped my vietnamese coffee on the floor on the way out because I'm a huge klutz and went to clean it up but the lovely employees (I'm thinking the owner is the one who actually was interacting with us-- VERY friendly man) said to not worry about it. He mopped it up and poured me a fresh iced vietnamese coffee which I was very thankful for. Great hospitality and a kind attitude goes a very long way in the food industry. If your personality is beautiful and contagious, then that's a reason to come back in itself.

All in all... The bagels were delicious. Homemade cream cheese is AMAZING. Vietnamese coffee is strong how I like it and I'm going to be hyped for the next couple of hours because of it, LOL. Pricing is just right. They're in a prime location right off a main street and I hope they're here for a long time! Happy belated 1 year, The Bagelry!</Review><UserId.>109824026213689578263</UserId.><gmapID>0x80c2d532c6fa00c7:0x64bd3ca34ed6d65d</gmapID><rating>5</rating><response>None< /response><username>Christine Dawson< /username></record>

I got here around 9:30 and most of the bagels were already out, goes to show how good they are. The Nova bagel is absolutely amazing, the ingredients were amazingly fresh and delicious. Best bagel I've ever had. Fresh squeezed orange juice was good too.<//text>

< Review>
The bagels were alright. Just alright. Big, size which is cool, filling. However, the flavor left a lot to be desired. We ordered a variety of sweet and savory but they all were rather plain tasting. Particularly, the cinnamon raisin bagels barely tasted of cinnamon. All of them had a garlicky taste, as if the slicer or toaster had not been cleaned from the previous bagel. Overall, it was okay. Would we go back? Probably not.<//Review>

and luckily I did because they have more then just bagels! I had the Nova bagel which is lox, cream cheese, red onion,  tomato, capers and I LOVED it! Can't wait to try their sandwiches. Oh yeah the owner is super nice too. I definitely recommend this place for breakfast and will try it for lunch my next trip.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d532c6fa00c7:0x64bd3ca34ed6d65d<//gmap_id></record>

Loved it! Nice atmosphere, friendly and personable staff. My husband got a Asiago Spinach bagel with egg bacon cheese and avocado and it was amazing. I had the Summer Chill smoothie and it felt healthy and refreshing. The Vietnamese coffee was great too!
If they created a Keto Bagel, we would be here every day!< /text>

<text>Super nice inside! Smoothie was solid. Vietnamise coffee was so good and the egg cheese and bacon breakfast sandwich on an asiago spinach bagel with avocado was legit! Breakfast and coffee for two for 17$. Everything felt very fresh and very healthful I can't get over how great this place was!<//text>< name>

< Review>
The owner gave us a lovely walk-through of the menu, which was a nice personal touch. My Nova Classic came open faced, and that's not necessarily my preference, but the components were excellent. Make sure to ask for your bagel toasted if you order it with cream cheese, it isn't standard. The eggs in the breakfast sammies come out at about a million degrees, so be careful! The milk tea with boba was solid.< /Review>

Wow! So good! We do not rat meat and I saw that they had fish tacos on the menu. Some of the best fish tacos I ever had. We had to order seconds. It was a one man show.  And the man was the nicest! Highly recommended!< /text>

Their fish and shrimp corn tacos are so good! The salsa was the best I’ve ever had. And the prices are super affordable. Friendly workers as well.<//Text>

Food was alright. The menu is pretty diverse with a bit of something for all sorts of tastes and even some vegetarian options, don't know why. Other than that food was alright could have been better, non the less this is the only "Mexican" food place near school so it would suffice for the time being.</Text>

Truly was not fond of the environment of the place. The menu has no pricing which is kind of strange because one needs to let his/her customers know what is available. Food was good, but would not really go back due to the way they make you feel at that place.< /text>

The street corn if phenomenal, the sopes gordos was fantastic- and the best part was the Diablo taco. Probably the best thing I've ever eaten. That was last week.... This week I ordered a surf and turf tostada and it was just as amazing as everything else. And of course another Diablo taco. I don't know if this place has won awards but if not it should !</review>< pics>

This place is a gem. They are located in Gardena but totally worth the drive. The cakes are amazingly delicious, very delicate, the texture is very light and not loaded with sugar. It's a small business which means every cake is carefully  crafted. And if you are wondering, yes, they do have parking  on site.< /review>

< Review>
The best strawberry shortcake I have ever eaten in my life! The service was impeccable and they even included a few candles along with a nice personalized birthday decoration on the cake made of high quality white chocolate. I called ahead and the guy said he would hold the cake for me (I know they sellout frequently) and when I got there he had boxed it and had it waiting in the fridge for me. Awesome!!! I have to go back this week to try some of the other cakes and pastries that I saw were presliced in individual servings. I highly recommend trying out this place.< /Review>

My dinner guest brought us slices of cake from Nagomi Cake House. I picked Chocolate. These are some of the best Japanese style cakes I’ve had the pleasure to devour. I haven’t visited yet, but will be sure to make it a required stop when I’m in the Torrance area. You should too!<//review>

<Text>Their roll cake was one of the top notch Japanese baked goods I’ve ever had!!

It tasted so FRESH, MOIST, FLUFFY, simply PERFECT...!!

The fresh whipped cream and strawberry slices with the cake just all came together perfectly...

I could see them continuously baking in their kitchen and their service was amazing, too.

I would come back here and I recommend you to try it yourself, if you are into Japanese baked goods!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdK9VuDb9_t96TATX9QjEFh7kbMG6u0XgPNpbk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjoxlRyTlXrY4VsJMCipJzIJ0R-t5g_alIWqw6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONWvpytyaeAcLF8yUI-_I4gYqNrgmOaaiLuB1z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUHGWWCGe2_EPrahxGBY0WNs27GkzoRJeekrrf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

It is slightly more expensive than other local Japanese bakeries but, in my opinion, the sweets at Nagomi Cake House is worth the price. I always end up gravitating to here for birthday and special event cakes.<//text>

Amazing. Just absolutely amazing. Over the past couple of experiences with American sweets in LA, I’ve noticed that many of the desserts contain way too much sugar, especially when it comes to frosting, but when I came to this place, however, everything was absolutely perfect. I tried nearly every dessert here and it’s not too sweet, but it contains enough flavor. This is why Japanese desserts will always top American desserts. This place deserves way more credit than it has right now.< /Text>

I like this place, the cakes are really delicious. The staff is really nice and polite. There is a parking lot outside. I don't like there are only four small tables. If you want to eat there, it could be a problem.</text>

Definitely some of the best cake around. The cakes are all light, fluffy, and just the right amount of sweet. They have multiple flavors, whole cakes for purchase, as well as coffee. We’ve been here twice and will absolutely be back.< /Text>

<Response>None< /Response><review>A full step above the other Japanese cake shops in the area, but not so different in price. NOT easy to notice from the street.
Cute gimmick: the four tables there are all turntables, so its easy to share.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2b57847578379:0xd391a8cc214b50a9<//GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics>< userid>

Arithmetic Japanese cake.
I like most of their cakes, but the strawberry mont blanc is the best!< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It was very delicious! It was a delicate sweetness. The cream puff skin was very thin, crispy and full of custard. The cream of the roll cake is very delicious! !!

<review>My first and last time having my nails done there. Where in this entire America do you pay $109 for a simple gel manicure and gel pedicure?? I didn't even get a design nor did I get an acrylic. This nail shop claim that  there prices went up due to the pandemic, my question is; is iteit legal to charge what we normally pay $50 and now paying charged $109?  This has to be reported to the BBB as they are not running an honest business. I was very disappointed walking out of the nail studio. Again, first and last day EVER going there.<//review>< Pics>

<text>The only place I will go for acrylic nails!  I went to 5 different salons before I found them. I can get a fill once a month and they look new the whole time. Quality is outstanding! Kevin has been doing my nails now for 6 years....never had one lift or break. I need them to re-open!!!</text>< pics>

The salon is spotless from head to toe. Didn't had that chemical smell in the salon. When it was my turn the nail tech working on me was very good at removing the cuticles from my nails. Didn't even bleed from that process. She also listen to my requests too. When she was done, my nails looked very refined! 😍😍😍<//review><Name>Juliette Simpson<//Name></record>

<review>The first person that did my nails made my nails look bumpy, messy, and see-through. I then demanded for them to fix them. Then, another lady fixed my nails, still leaving paint residue on my fingers. Meanwhile, it took my aunt around 1 hour to get just a pedicure, which left no time for a manicure.< /review>< Rating>

<Review>Worse mani & pedi ever. I went into to get mani & pedi. Cindy did my nails and cut my cuticles so bad on both hands they would not stop bleeding. Worse part abt it was that instead of cleaning the blood or stopping the service she tried to paint over the blood stained n residue nails and continue to double dip into the polish. I told her it was unsanitary and she disagreed.  The pedi girl basically just washed my feet and polished my toes not a real pedi. She didn't even try she just seemed uninterested. From my observations,  These nail techs are inexperienced and definitely needs lesson on being sanitary. I doubt if they are even licensed professional or they would know about being clean and sanitary.  I wouldn't recommend this place to any one instead I would warn you not to go to this place.<//Review>< Pictures>

Excellent place to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. They also have dried fruit, jarred olives, and other goodies. Better prices than grocery stores and farmers markets. If you are in the area , check them out!< /text>

This is a regular stop off for us whenever we are headed back from the coast. If you need fresh fruits and vegetables, this is the place.</Review>

I love Francisco's Fruits!! It's the perfect  spot to pick up some fresh fruit and veggies on the way to or from the beach. They have so much here! They have really good honey, papaya, grapefruit, ORANGES, cherries, all sorts of Mexican candy. The owner is in a Mariachi band, and they have a stage/lights here where they play live :) This place is a must!! Oh, and they accept debit and credit, which is awesome.<//Text>

I've been going here for over 20 years and the fruit here is excellent, especially the oranges. The produce is fresh and delicious. I am rarely disappointed by a purchase here. Just be sure to store everything properly the moment you get home. I've found the produce here to spoil quicker than stuff you would buy from the supermarket.</Text>

<Text>We love their oranges. We buy them by the boxful because they are so sweet, and so inexpensive. If you love Mexican sweet treats, this is the place to get them. Our kids love to explore the exotic fruits they sell. Some are outright weird, but delicious.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>The place is very clean and almost all the time (as far as I've seen) it's not crowded.

The restrooms are clean as well.

The train and bus lines are well labeled, you can easily move inside because there are good and precise signs.

Besides, the personal is kind and helpul.

The place is well connected given that there are taxis and a public-bus station just across the street.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt3DsXl6zbGdLim_T-Y6MwLc0eEZaXq6ifvAkv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_xRYHsHbPFNEaUu6PK67nF9u9A5KBKX-oF_fY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0bWGZAGvXmbr_dkQGQtvyfAlNznzRASYUHz7V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<Text>The Oxnard Transit Center does show its age, but it has aged gracefully. There's lots of seating inside, the property is well maintained, there's a public lavatory of reasonable cleanliness, and the staff is friendly. There's a coffee shop that sells basic snacks and drinks. There's little hustle and bustle these days except when a small clutch of travellers arrive or depart on the trains. The transit center has not been immune to the wave of vagrants that roam the streets in the last few years, but on-site security has kept them at bay for the most part.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

How is the country that runs Amtrak the number 1 economy in the world? No wonder the Chinese own this country.</Review>

The train station was nice and the boys enjoyed their trip to Grover Beach.  The lady that worked in the train station was the most rude person I have ever dealt with in my history of using the train system.  I was explaining to her that my boys were riding the train to meet my husband and she did not want to let them ride alone.  I explained to her that they were old enough and she said I heard you the three times that you told me, but refused to let them on. She needs to get a new job.</text>

Every person I speak with gives me a number that nobody answers.  Spoke to one rep at 830 and was told the station closed at 820. Then got disconnected and called back, spoke to a new rep, he told me they closed right that second. Which was 15 minutes after the last guy told me they closed 10 minutes before that. Bunch of lazy people clocking in and clocking out. Oh, and dont even think about leaving your car behind in their parking lot. Unless it looks condemned. You will get you car broken into 9 out of 10 times.<//text><user_id>118020826494059488744</user_id><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

<review>The bus was supposed to arrive at 9:10pm. it was delayed. We've been told until 10:15. Instead of staying open to accommodate the people stuck waiting, they kicked everyone out at 9:40. Not only is that rude and incredibly unprofessional, but it's heartless, as some of the people waiting are children. This station is, apparently, garbage, and so are the lazy bastards working it.< /review>< date>

Left my phone on the train. I was on my bike. Told conductor that I needed to go back and get my phone... They did not hold the door for me.  Got stuck in long line at station, to make a report that my phone was on the train that just left. Gentleman behind the desk asked me to wait at the end of the line... I told him I just waited in the line... Eventually I was told that the train would be coming back through at 7:35... I told him that I'd like the conductor to get it before it gets picked up by someone else, he should remember where I was sitting... I had a bike + he wouldn't hold the door.. checking the train myself 3 hours later is pointless. On my urging, he wrote my name and number on a piece of paper. Nothing formal I guess. No incident number or anything like that... A piece of scratch paper. I had no confidence in getting my phone back... Late that evening I for a call, they had my phone... In the end it worked out for me.< /text>

Its a small-town transit center. As 'transit centers' go, it's clean and organised. Beware that Amtrak parking is hard to find; it's on the opposite side of bus queue area, under the bridge.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I used it between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles but when I made a reservation by telephone it was the worst correspondence of the operator and the train stopped moving in rain but did not respond to refunds and asking the reason why I was going backwards and eventually I got on the next day ticket I could not stay at the hotel that I had my replacement and booked, and I lost a lot. Moreover, the train was delayed the next day and it was delayed by 1 hour by departure time, and another hour later after an hour, there was an announcement, and after waiting for more than 4 hours eventually I went to the destination with another bus company. I was not in Japan, so I did not expect to keep time perfect, but I did not think it was terrible so far. I will not use Amtrak twice. We recommend not to use Japanese people who saw this.

サンタバーバラ〜ロサンゼルス間で使いましたが電話で予約するときもオペレーターの対応最悪でしたし、雨で電車が動かなくなったのに返金に応じず、理由を尋ねると逆ギレされ結局翌日のチケットに交換してもらい予約していたホテルにも泊まれずに、大損しました。しかも翌日も電車が遅延し発車時刻に1時間遅れる、そのまた1時間後に1時間遅れるとアナウンスがあり、結局4時間以上待たされ別のバス会社で目的地まで行きました。日本ではないので時間を完璧に守るというのを期待してはいませんでしたがここまで酷いと思いませんでした。もう2度とAmtrakは使いません。これを見た日本人の方々も使わないことをお勧めします。</Text>

Wow, you guys are awesome! I have a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee, and I brought my car in for an installation of a suspension lift and replacement of all bushings and control arms.  The team at Big Brand on Milpas have completely exceeded my expectations! Victor was very reasonable, fair and honest when he gave me the estimate, and the mechanic Oscar went above and beyond installing the suspension kit! I’m so impressed with the quality of work they have done on my car! They did such an amazing job! I have gone to them in the past and will continue to take my car there for everything regarding suspension, brakes and tires! Honest, trustworthy, and quality work is how I would describe them. Thanks again guys!<//Text>

Took my truck in because my tires and steering wheel were shacking and they told me I needed new ball joints which would cost 2,000. This was a lot of money to me so I wanted to make sure they weren’t just trying to rob me so I took my truck to two other mechanics for a second and third opinion.  Thank god I did because both mechanics told me my ball joints were perfectly fine and that the shacking was coming from my rims because I didn’t have hub centric rings which are only 25 dollars. I would have thought that Big brand tires would have know this was the issue because they mainly focus on tires and rims but I guess they were more focused on robbing me off my money.< /Text>

Victor was very helpful and knowledgeable. I dropped my car off to have the tire repaired. While the car was there, they did a free tire rotation and alignment check. Victor noticed the shocks were wearing out and let me know what he discovered when I arrived. I will return to have the shocks repaired at a later date.</review>

I am very grateful! I was a woman alone, nervous and clueless to what I was in for. The staff was so incredibly kind and patient. They handled it all, I didn’t have to do anything. I thought I had blown out my tire and was stressed on having to buy a new one, but they tried to fix it first and I was able to leave all within 45 min. They didn’t even charge me. That just doesn’t happen in this world right now. Thank you guys so much, I will be back!< /review>

Very helpful staff. I was able to get an affordable price on tires and even  though they were extremely busy the morning I took my car in they were very courteous and polite and were able to turn the car around in what I thought to be an incredibly short amount of time. They even sent me a voicemail to let me know that my car was ready. I definitely recommend their services. I have been using them for for years and even though they have changed ownership their service is still top notch.</text>

Just picked up my car and after getting the tune-up they suggested it is driving so much better! I never feel like they’re up selling me here so I trust their recommendations when they let me know something is needed. Ricky was also super helpful and patient today when I checked back in a few times with questions. Highly recommend.</Text>

These place is honestly amazing 👏 sooo many free services like tore rotation and they were truthful...nothing was wrong w my car. Ive never written a review for anyone before but just had to express how different they are from other oil change locations like jiffy lube that charge twice as much. Super safe...plastic on the seat and wheel</text>

Quick, professional, efficient and had the tire for the right price! Safety checks were done for free and they didn't try to upsell me on anything bogus so I can see why this is a very busy Service Center... if you want to be a "satisfied
customer", I suggest you make an appointment - if you're walking in, be ready to wait as these professionals are busy -  they'regood at what they do so they're in high demand. If I were them I would strike for higher wages, better benefits and more time off they were working on President's day where everybody else was running around clogging up traffic pretending like they didn't have a job to go to the next day.<//text>

Very good services, by people that care. They do flat tire, tire rotation and tire air services for free. The parking is limited and can be tight at times, but it's well worth it to come here<//text>

After quickly identifying The problem with my tire, I needed to purchase a new one which was available and match the other set of tires I had on my car. After recognizing I needed an alignment, they compensated me for this because I had An alignment from them three months ago so still in warranty. Much appreciated.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Nothing but good things to say about Big Brand on Milpas. Beyond the excellent service at a modest price, they’ve helped me out a number of times, free of charge. Last time was on New Year’s Eve when my car, which I had parked a block from their facility, wouldn’t start. They took time out from their busy schedule and sent a guy to jumpstart it. No charge. Ten days later, when the battery (which I had purchased from them) completed discharged, they replaced it at no cost, no questions asked, no hassle.</text>< Pictures>

Everyone here is so nice and super helpful! I had picked out new rims and tires on tirerack.com where Big Brand is an installation partner. I'm so glad I didn't buy online! I went in and worked with Victor, who patiently provided recommendations and various options. In the end I ended up with entirely different options and they matched the pricing on tirerack.com.  I was happy to support the brick and mortar business after all of their help. I even had buyer's remorse for my original selection and the next day Victor changed my order happily.<//review>

<text>I dropped off a flat tire to be fixed at 9:30 in the morning & went on to work. Big Brand called me 1 hr later w it fixed. I picked up the tire on my way home from work @ 4:45. One of the employees took my car immediately. He put the tire on, reset my flat tire indicater & put the spare in my trunk. It took all of 10 min.

<Resp>{'time': 1611681599564, 'text': 'Wow, thank you for your great review! We are so glad we could find you an excellent set of tires that met all of your needs and stayed within your price range. It was a pleasure to work with you, and we hope to see you again the next time you need anything!'}< /Resp><review>On a rare rainy day in Santa Barbara the professionals worked hard and fast to get all the people like myself back on the road quickly and safely.

The price I paid for 4 tires was $109.97 less than Walmart! And all the other tire places that said they would match or beat this incredible set of tires from BBT. Yet no one would match the price because of their low prices and standard things Big Brand offers their customers.

I recommend that you go to the Big Brand site and look up your tires and research some choices before you call them. And recommend that you call and talk to one of their many professional sales people asking them about your choices. For me,  I wanted a tire that gave me good millage, longevity and handling. After 20 minutes on the phone I was satisfied that the 4 tires met my goals and my budget!

I think that the staff at Big Brand Tire are achieving their goal as a company providing the best customer experience possible.

Everyone there was wonderful! I'm thankful.

And... I was worried after buying my tires that there might have been a lower price after  a few days that passed before I went in to my tire appointment, so I went online (silly me I had already drove off away and got home) where I looked around and nobody could beat the deal I got! Sometimes you buy tires and find out that there was a better deal, and that was not the case with me. They are the best tire and servive!

Every time I go to Big Brand Tire they do me right!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>113317613308096588758<//userid><GmapID>0x80e837e23255d67f:0x2c74f327f7c07865</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They used to be good when they were on Nopal St.  Too busy now.  Nice people but the system does not work.  I have an appointment for a flat tire, it's been two hours and they have not even looked at it.
What's the point of having an appointment?

If you ever need tires or a tire repaired, I highly recommend Big Brand Tires on Milpas. Lexus wanted to charge me up to $500 to fix my right front tire, which was consistently leaking air. (They couldn't find any puncture.) Lexus told me it might be a "beading" issue on the inside of the chrome wheel. Turns out they were right, but they wanted to charge me $500 to find out and fix it. Big Brand Tires charged me nothing to find out and fix it!

I also bought four tires from Big Brand Tires a few years ago for my previous automobile and they were terrific & reasonably priced.<//review>

Fast service given the shop was very busy. My tire was repairable which was so great because I can’t afford a new tire. Still VICTOR looked for the best price if necessary, $78.

This is a good place to get tires and oil changes, but I'd go elsewhere for other work. My car starter was wonky (sometimes it started, sometimes it didn't) so I asked them to check it out during an oil change. They told me it was fine. I'm pretty sure they just turned the car on and since it started successfully, they said there was no problem. A few months later, I found myself in a tow truck getting towed to different place down the road (Classic Design -- highly recommended) bc the starter fully stopped working. Anyway, during that oil change, Big Brand told me I needed new brakes and brake drums. While they weren't wrong, I got the work done for $200 cheaper than their quote elsewhere. In conclusion: good for oil and tires, bad for diagnostic work and overpriced for other repairs.</text>

They always do an amazing job on breaks, wheels and tires. Today they also did a great job installing sway bars for me. There are definitely cheaper places, but you get what you pay for.

These guys fixed my flat for free just now. A couple of years ago I bought my tires from them, and found the experience excellent. They do professional work, are well organized, and have reasonable prices. I wholeheartedly recommend them.< /Review>

<text>Mr. Singh and his staff literally went above and beyond to help me out of a jam this past week. I had a flat nearby, followed by a flat spare tire. Luckily we caught them closing up shop after hours and they couldn't have been more helpful. Considering the time of day, they saved me from a massive headache and at least one tow. Tires were replaced the next morning and I had my car back by 9am. Great service, great price. Can't thank them enough.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I was passing through Santa Barbara to LA when I got a flat tire, it was 15 minutes to 5pm on Saturday I looked them up and called them. They were very sweet and understanding! And although they were closing at 5pm, they were waiting for me! When I got there they took care of me in such a quick and professional manner. I totally recommend them!< /review>

<review>We came in early on Sunday to get the tires checked, which is a complementary service. We understood that the service was in order to attract new clientele, so we thought we give them a try. After being told it would only be an hour wait, we decided to walk to a local coffee shop and come back. Once we return after an hour, we realized that it hadn’t been worked on and that it was going to be a much longer wait. When we asked for the keys back, we were informed that they were in the vehicle but to wait until they were wrapping up their paying customer & said they’d ask the technician when it’s be worked on. After they were finished with the customer, we were just told that the keys were in the car without being worked on. Really poor customer service. If this was their attempt to attract new customers, would definitely recommend going elsewhere.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Tires are a commodity, pretty much the same selection at the same price at most dealers. What sets Big Brand on Milpas apart is the people. Delip, the manager, Victor and Hector are all extremely customer oriented, helpful and efficient.  What can be a trying process is more manageable as a result of them.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.</text><name>B K<//name><date>1595012531541</date><gmap_id>0x80e837e23255d67f:0x2c74f327f7c07865<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This was my first experience at a Big Brand Tire and I can't say enough good things about them.  The store on Milpas run by Delip Singh is so efficiently run and friendly, it is amazing.  I showed up at 8 am on Saturday thinking maybe there would only be a few people ahead of me in line.  There were probably ten and the staff moved through everyone with grace and ease (all while socially distancing).

I just had a punctured tire and had not purchased my tires there and it was still FREE!!  Going forward I will always use Big Brand for all my tire needs.  Thank you Delip, Ricky and Hector for such a great experience!!</Review>

<Review>The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. My (six year old) soon and I arrived after 5pm with a flat tire. They provided cold bottles of water, and a cool, calm waiting area. Everything was well explained, and the tire was patched at no charge. There was no unnecessary hard sell to get a new tire. I would not hesitate to go again, or to recommend it to others. Staying open until 6pm was the key factor for us today, but the excellent service would definitely send me back!<//Review><GmapID>0x80e837e23255d67f:0x2c74f327f7c07865< /GmapID><Date>1564637016199< /Date><Rate>5</Rate>< Resp>

< review>
Big Brand regularly takes on way more work than they can handle. I recently went in to get one tire replaced and my car ended up being ready around SEVEN hours later.  I had an appointment at 11:15 AM and got my car back at around 6:15 PM. I called multiple times to try to get an update, but couldn't get through and got hung up on a couple times. I ended up going over at around 5:30 PM expecting that they just forgot to call and let me know that my car was done, but they hadn't even started on it after being there for SIX hours! I said I wanted my car back, but someone (maybe the manager) told me to wait for another 20 minutes while they actually work on the car. So it took them over six hours to get around to 20 minutes of work. What's the point of making an appointment? When I dropped off my car, they said they were really busy and it would take TWO hours max. I took my car to the Milpas location after having a recent similar experience at the Goleta location. Hoped it would be better, but was so much worse. When waiting there, it actually seems like you have to go and routinely ask people behind the counter (I hate having to bug them for updates) about your car so they remember to work on it. I gave them the extra star because it was during the holidays and they were busy. But they should know how busy they are and not let people make appointments/drop off their cars if they are way too busy to even come close to their initial time estimate. This is an issue almost every single time I've been to Big Brand. Definitely going to America's Tire Depot from now on.<//review>

I received excellent service; they fixed the old patch on my tire and it doesn’t leak anymore and they didn’t even charge me! The staff was helpful and very courteous. I’m going there when I need new tires (which won’t be in very long).

Thanks Ricky!</review>

This place is amazing. We had a nail in our tire and almost every other place we looked up was closed (it was a Sunday). When we drove our car to Big Brand, the place was packed but they took care of us right away. It was less than 90 minutes after we dropped the car off that they called to tell us it was ready. The best part was that it was free to fix the tire. Super efficient and organized. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area or passing through.< /review>

These guys were great.   Very accommodating.  But because of that their busy all the time.   Make an appointment.  Excellent service. Great prices.   I got a flat tire in a Sunday.  They fixed it for free.   I've never been there before and it shocked me it was free to fix.   I needed two new front tires anyways so I bought them from them because they were so generous that day.   These guys ROCK.</Text>

<Text>Thanks again for patching my tire. Nothing puts a bump in your day like getting a screw or nail in your tire. Luckily Big Brand Tire saves the day.  I got a screw in my tire today and was all bummed out about it then I remembered Big brand fixes those free. So I went over to the shop and it was already after 4 when I got there. I walked in and right away Ricky says he will be with me in just a moment as he was helping another client. So I explained to him that I picked up a screw and asked if he could grab a pair of pliers to see if we might get lucky and pull it out without a leak.  Unfortunately soon as he pulled it out the air started whistling out. Then he looked at the tires and saw that they might be a little old and said if they were over six years old he would not be able to patch the tire I said well let’s cross our fingers and hope you can. I went down the street to take care of some business and grab a bite to eat I was back maybe an hour later and the car was ready with the original tire patched and back on the car.  I thanked Ricky for his help and asked who did the job so that I could give them a 20 dollar tip. Another great experience at Big Brand tire store.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80e837e23255d67f:0x2c74f327f7c07865<//gmap_id>< response>

I’ve been going to big Brand tire on Milpas Street through three different cars for around six years. They always have the best prices and the customer service is fantastic. They take care of you and honor their warranties.<//Review>

I made an appointment and waited over an hour to get 3 tires changed. I wasted my entire lunch break waiting and my car never even moved. I'm unsure what the point of making an appointment is good for if I still have to wait no matter what. I'm going to pursue different options from now on when it comes to automobile services. I suggest you do the same if you value your time.</Review>

Web access was fast. The team fixed my tire and had me back on the road. No charge$.
Amazing service, fresh coffee and a team with a winning attitude!
Besides the tires, see them for oil changes, brakes and lots more.
Excellent customer service!

Not even a good experience at all!!  I made an appointment for an oil change for 11:30am and even showed up 20 minutes early and they didn't touch my truck until about 2 and a half hours later.  By the time they finally got to my truck, finished my oil change and cashed me out it took almost 4 hours!!  Unacceptable specially for just an oil change.  None of the workers there took their time or cared enough to let me know while I kept waiting or even apologized at all.  Another thing is when you're standing at the counter trying to get help and there's a worker on one of the computers almost facing you they don't even acknowledge you at all.  Not even to ask you to "wait and that they will be right with you".  Other workers pass right in front of you and they don't greet you or ask if you need help either.  You get ignored constantly.  I've been a customer for a few years but it's time to find a better place that can appreciates customers better.<//Text>

All I can say is that I’m very disappointed. My family and i have been coming here for the last 7 years. I got to the shop and was treated very poorly to the point that I decided to leave and take my car to a different place. I will definitely pass my experience to all my family so they don’t come back here. Reading other people’s reviews clearly shows they have a problem with customer service.<//Review>

Fast, easy, good price, good service. My second or third time over several years. The place is always jammed so they must be doing something right. Mechanics seem to know what they are doing.  I bought 2 tires, and had alignment which was done quickly with apparently very modern machines, giving me clean printouts. No complaints...it does what a tire shop should do.< /text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>Amazing customer service!!!! I realized last night at about 6:30 that my tire was quickly going flat due to a nail puncture. I made the decision to drive to Big Brand, where I had purchased all of my tires, and leave my car there overnight since they closed at 6. However, when I arrived, I saw an angel of a worker named Sam who was still in the building. I gave him a little wave, and he unlocked the door to speak with me. I told him my situation, and not only did he say I could leave the car there overnight, but he opened up a garage so I could pull it into a bay. I got a call this morning that it was repaired, no charge. Fantastic! To my surprise, when I arrived to pick it up Sam was there. This guy is working hard. If you see him, please give him a high-five for me!<//Text><userid>113961144068109721953</userid>< Rate>

<text>January 2017. Needed a new tire. Service was friendly and professional. Two years later tried to get the same tire for the other side, but could not get it anywhere. Wondered why and checked the tire.
Found out that the model they sold me for full price was outdated then, manufactured two years before, in 2015.
This is how you lose your reputation!</text>< pictures>

Friendly people. I called for an oil change appointment. I decided to drop it off early and grab some lunch. They finished the oil change and checked tire pressure and gave me a call to come pick it up 30 minutes later, and an hour before my scheduled time. They always have a few bucks off coupon if you check their website. I recommend Big Brand Tire!<//text>

I've been doing business with the Santa Barbara store for 30 years, they have worked on my fleet of trucks and my personal vehicles and I've been very loyal. Literally spent thousands of dollars there. I believe a business shines when things don't go as planed and make things right. Recently it was time for new tires for one of my personal meticulously kept prize vehicle. In the process the technician was careless and damaged three out of the four wheels beyond repair.  The technician to my face claimed the damage was present, not so. The manager took his side and agreed to replace one wheel. After back and forth conversation we agreed on him replacing two and I the third... fine. Well manufacture no longer makes these wheels. So same deal with a new set.....  fine. With new wheels went in to have them installed, he said he would pay for two, wanted two of the old set back and I need to go elsewhere to get them installed because I was a problem and was trying to get free wheels  Really!! Plan was to sell the old complete set and re cope a small amount of out of pocket. I went in for tires, not WHEELS! I still don't get how he can dismiss a good longtime customer that if he made things right and stood behind his employees good or bad performance would continue to come back. He would more than make up the loss with future business. Moved on, payed for the new set of wheels and installation at another local business. It was a very expensive experience.

If you have especially, premium wheels take a picture of each wheel before they touch your vehicle.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I put the spare on and drove over to Big Brand and they had my tire repaired and patched within the hour and even put my spare back in my trunk and the original tire back on for me which saved me SO much hassle. They even offered me a water in their lobby and every employee was so sweet to me. I will definitely be coming to them when I need new tires or services because it's a place I know I can trust< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Bought new tires for my wife's car.  She did not like the ride comfort of the new tires.  Took the car back and Big Brand put on some different tires to accommodate a better ride comfort at no extra cost.  Wife loves the new tires. Thank you Josh, Victor and the crew at Big Brand tires!</Text>

<review>We were in town for a wedding and had to get back on the road quickly, but our driver's side window wasn't driving up after getting the car back from the valet. Stopped in on a Sunday to see if these guys could take a look. Not only were they willing to take a look on the spot, but through some trial and error, Sam was able to get our window back on track and save us a very windy drive back to San Diego. Thank you Sam!<//review>< pictures>

< review>
Had a leveling kit put in years ago. They took off a caliper( which they did not have to) in the process and ended up screwing in in too tight which stripped it. I had to replace caliper when i had a brake job. After the kit was installed i got home to check it out. I found all the bolts on the top of the strut were hand screwed on. ( i drove 18 miles like this)  my buddy went there to get a leveling kit put on too. I was with him. We asked to see the parts. They brought the parts out in a unmarked box and they were obviously used.  My buddy went elswere. I do not reccomend this place to anyone getting anything but tires.<//review>

<Review>Do not open a big brand tire card at this location and possibly other locations if they’re as shady as this place. 🚨 they will tell you you’re getting 0% interest for 6 months on the card but thats a lie just to get customers to open an account with them. Big brand sign says 5% off today and everyday when using your big brand card, but you have to spend over 200$.  I spent 397$ On tires with the big brand credit card I had all the money up front but when they mentioned sign up for the card and get 6 months 0% interest, I thought why not save my money for now and just pay the minimum on the card for a couple months before I paid the card off. When I looked at my statement I noticed I was getting charged interest and that’s when I went to the Milpas store to tell them about it and all they would say is we gave you the choice of 5% off the purchase or 0% interest for 6months. Now why would I open a big brand credit card that’s gonna charge me interest when I had all the money to pay for the tires cash? It was the 0% for 6months that sold me on signing up for the card<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

My husband and I are driving cross country for 70 days for our honeymoon. We discovered a nail had punctured our tire on day 30 when we were on the opposite side of the country from home. We found Big Brand Tire online and thought the free flat repair was too good to be true. But they did it! Victor, the assistant manager, took care of us and got us back on the road in no time at all and at no charge! Many many thanks to Victor and team at Big Brand Tire in Santa Barbara!<//text>

<review>I received excellent service from this Big Brand Location.

The low tire pressure yellow warning light went on in my vehicle and I was concerned I had damage to my tire.

I set an appointment to have it looked at and the tech asked me several questions to try and identify which tire had the issue.  He checked the pressure on each tire and determined that all tires were low; most likely due my previous oil change tech setting the pressure too low on all tires.  He then filled each tire to the proper pressure and sent me on my way five minutes later, no charge.

Thanks guys!< /review><Response>None< /Response>< date>

< Review>
I was unsatisfied with my visit to Big Brand Tire. I had a small screw stuck in my tire that caused a slow leak. The screw was less than 1/4'' in diameter. The screw was towards the center of the tire (not near the shoulder and not on the sidewall).

The attendant - who was very nice and seemed competent - told me that it was impossible to fix and that I needed four new tires (this was for a AWD car), for about $600. The tires were all new and less than 3 months old so I was reluctant to spend that much money on new tires.

I left Big Brand Tires and went to a different shop who just looked at the tire, told me "no problem" and fixed it for $20 in like 15 minutes.

Big Brand Tire advertises that they fix flats for free. After my experience, I can't help but think that this is just a ruse to get people in the door and try to sell them tires.< /Review>

Rude, rude, rude. I called the number on the site and he told me I could get an 11:00 am appointment. Then he had a "problem with his system" (seems to happen every time I call), so he transferred me. Then I was put on hold with the other guy because it was really busy at the store location. Fine, I understand that. So I waited...and waited...and waited.  While I was on hold, they gave away my appointment slot that the other representative promised me. I was on hold long enough to rearrange my day's schedule. So I was frustrated when I got back on the phone and told the guy that and he said I was shouting at him. Are you kidding me?! This guy has no idea how to deal with customers. This is the last appointment I'll make with these unprofessional idiots.<//Text>

<text>They didn't touch my car for over an hour until I said I needed to cancel everything and get my keys because I had an appointment at 6 (brought it in at 4:30, asked for keys after 5:30 rolled around, I thought 1.5 hours was plenty of time for changing 4 tires, balancing, and alignment).  This totally screwed up everything as the meeting had to be canceled because they weren't even done by 6.  Would sort of understand as it was a busy day and I made a late appt, but they were helping their girlfriend/wife and several other random people that showed up after me first and didn't care what I thought until I needed to go.  They did however fix the alignment and the car runs smoother.<//text><UserId.>117987865090165296532</UserId.><gmap_id>0x80e837e23255d67f:0x2c74f327f7c07865<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I get there 20 min early and they claim they have no record of the appointment and they dont have the tires I ordered. But hey he says, Il get you way better tires for the same price! Ok great. Oh they are 5 dollars more? No problem. Oh these are $80 tires for $52? Wow you guys are great! I get home and google the tires they gave me, $42 from a competitor. He also tried to give me my total with additional $30 warranty....without asking if I wanted it. I caught him and told him to take it off. Then they did the alignment check and guess what? It was off! Gonna cause weird wear he says. I found it odd that there was no weird wear pattern on the tires I had on there for over a year but what do I know? The whole thing took just over 2 hours. I am no expert and I cant make informed accusations but I can tell you I wont be going back there, ever.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

My name is Willy my mom will be mad at me for doing  this but i know she wouldn't  write  a good or bad comment. Our visit was really long because we made a appointment at 1:30 but they started working on the car at around 3:38 but they told us that the car was going to be ready at 3:15. Its 4:20 and we are still here. 😔<//Review>

Walked into the store to ask how much ear piercings are and if I could see the options. Sales associate proceeded to have the worst attitude when I asked her if I could see the options. Her response was “do you not see me cleaning the station. This means you need to make an appointment before you walk in.” Excuse me for asking two questions. Anyway I walked down the mall and an amazing lady did my piercings. Needless to say I will never be coming to this store again. Management needs to reevaluate who they hire.</text>

<Review>This store attracts lots of kids and teenagers.
My 12 year old daughter went shopping for the first time with her firend without having me inside the store with her.
She left with experiencing rude behavior from the sales associate during ck out.
It’s very sad that on a time like this workers can be rude to kids . I will never send her in the store without me being present.
Kids tell all workers should be smart enough.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>It's really cool here. They have so many cute little things like earings and headbands. Their color is purple which is great for me cuz usually places like this, their color is pink and I hate pink. Heads up Claire's, Justice is starting to copy you.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>The Japanese restaurant is excellent!  Great food and service. Parking is a challenge with only metered parking in the mall and most streets around!

Also the Mexican restaurant at the entrance is really good.  Great food and friendly atmosphere! It’s quality fast food at a fair price!

There is also a great breakfast and lunch spot that looks like it’s been there since the start of the plaza!  Really great food and old fashioned quality service make it a very comfortable place to sit and enjoy the start to a day and some great shopping in this little mall.<//Text>< pictures>

For over the years this has always been a great place to eat and to shop to honor local local businesses within a strip mall . We need more parking please more parking! The baby boomers such as myself need more handicap parking spaces. I have two hip replacements and my wife has one hip replacement. Need I say more? Other than that I hope and pray that the owners and management decide to develop some type of new parking spaces, even if they have to close down for a little bit and expand the parking overnight or a couple of days if necessary. Besides of this parking lot was suitable for residence I would say at least 10 years ago but now because of our booming economy, millennials and the frequent addition of new foreigners coming in from overseas and such at such a rapid pace that now we need to have more parking and disabled parking. This is the new reality and this is the new normal. It's not going to fix itself. Hopefully by this coming up fall that this can be fixed within this year or so. If not, all that tells me that this management or owners probably don't care, and all they care about is the money. I'm hope I'm wrong.</Review>

Pelton shopping centers a nice are you the only store or restaurant that I do not recommend at all is they  Hidden work  Going there for a few years the last time I went and I got food poisoning it I disposed my meal on the ground but I was walking to the car. The waitress is the one of the best as an attitude very disappointing I will never go back I do not recommend it<//Review>

Nice cozy collection of shops and restaurants. Parking fills up quick but it's free and there are wheelchair-accessible slots. No public restrooms. A couple of the restaurants and the bar do have restrooms but I believe those are just for customers. Close to public transportation. Lots of other resturaunts, stores and services in the immediate area.</review>

I drove through there with a friend of mine, we actually were going to the liquor store. For a place that's normally in motion, we got parking in an instant was an amazing trip.</Review>

I come to this shopping center to get tacos from the mexican resturant there the name escapes me but it is right at the begining across the way from Baskin Robbins. But if you want great mexican food go elsewhere this is the place to come on a late night mission to find food and this is the only place open. They have a bubble tea place that is always packed so I haven't gone there yet. The cupcake place is great but they just went up on their prices and it isnt worth it anymore, better to go to Just bundts in san leandro if you want something sweet but pricey< /review>

<Review>While it's OK, it's very nice to have a breakfast place there, and I would go eat every day there if I could. But there is a health store which is legit. There are many salons there and a few restaurants there with a bar, and an ice cream place.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Great place lots of shops. There's a great health food store, and old fashioned shoe repair place that repairs your shoes while you wait, a Baskin Robbins, dry cleaners, a strange sandwich Deli that closes super early, and an amazing Taqueria (burritos are their specialty), and of course a really amazing Diner with great breakfast and decorated in local antiques all over the walls.< /text><Response>None</Response><Name>D Pemberton<//Name><Rating>5< /Rating><userid>106839964956442751643< /userid><pictures>None</pictures></record>

Enjoy your best burrito at Los pericos or your best sushi at makiyaki. My favorite roll is 3 time lady. And shop for Whole Foods at the best health food store in the area.<//text>

Me and my colleagues' go-to place. From Mexican, Boba, Japanese... except the parking could be bit challenging. Just get there 15 mins ahead of everyone and you will be fine.<//Text>

Old favorites: Baskin Robbins, the Taqueria still here and few new ones.
I hit the Safeway while here, plus my dentist, eye doctor and Oral Surgeon are in the area. I used to live in San Leandro. Miss the old Emil Villas too!

The center still Rocks!<//review>
