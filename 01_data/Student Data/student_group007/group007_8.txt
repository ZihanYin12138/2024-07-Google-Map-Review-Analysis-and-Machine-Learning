Charged my dad from they opened to when he checked out because he lost the ticket. Their system somehow wasn't able to verify his license plate when it is clearly visible and it wasn't that active today.

A manual check would've easily verified my dad because we had a specific time frame for when he came in and he is very recognizable given all the specifics about his motorcycle and attire.</Review>

Huge underground garage convenient to Asian Art Museum, Brooks Hall, City Hall, Davies Symphony Hall, and Opera House. Space available posted on Franklin Street, entry on McAllister Street. Sometimes a low price for special events. May fill up if Brooks Hall has a big event on the same night as two other venues, come early on such nights.<//text>

<review>Don't get your car locked in 30 (whenever) minutes before its supposed to close. (I was sober and fully functioning)

Do not gamble with this garage past 9PM. It is not directly owned by the city and closes whenever the owner feels like closing. I arrived before 11:30 and had to be back in the city at 6AM to get my car. No fines or anything. But this is unreliable. Take your chances elsewhere, cheap though! But not worth it.

If you are a San Francisco resident, please lobby the city to change this garage's management. This is a reoccurring issue.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
As a tourist I look always for parking before going to Downtown San Francisco in this case look for parking close to the Nourse Theater. Parked around 7:20 PM there was plenty of space available exit and walked the few blocks, return around 10:45 PM. never encounter homeless once out we have a chance to take pictures of the display exhibit  . Parking was cheap  and easy access to Hwy 101. This was on April 22, 2015</Review>

<review>I park here for shows at the Orpheum

After getting my car broken into, paying for a lot is cheaper.  Have never had an issue here, is clean and secure

New setup has you pay before you get to the exit, you can exit on Larkun if the McAllister exit has a line, it is an extra block, but saved a bunch of time</review><resp>None<//resp><Rating>4< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Not the cheapest garage. Gets crowded during weekdays and hard to figure out where the valet is for first-timers. However, this garage is the most convenient for people wanting to go visit the SF city hall.<//text>

<Name>David W.<//Name><text>I parked here today, on a Thursday sunny morning (11:45am), March 26th, 2015.  First, I must inform everybody that this location is a safe-haven for many of the debilitated  homeless.  And you will see them loitering around next to trees, littering, smoking, and camping on the lawns.  Second, the staircases technically serve as their urinals; so be prepared to hold your breath, watch out for the puddles, and the buzzing flies; definitely a sanitary issue here!  Third, the elevators also have flies and littering, but without the smell, luckily that is.  Fourth, every level of the garage was packed beyond imaginable capacity, even at the above morning time-frame.  I was just lucky, because someone just happened to be pulling out.  So be prepared to circle around, until someone pulls out; a lot of patience here.  Fifth, and finally, the good news -- this parking garage implements a full security team.  The garage is monitored with digital PC surveillance, multiple patrol guards driving and walking around every level, and even a surface team scouting the entrances, staircases, and elevators.  Don't be surprised to see a lot a luxury cars parking here; I parked next to a new Porsche 911 GT, and across from several BMWs and Lexus.  Mostly likely due to the high level of security here.  But please note, everything that I observed was during the day time; so I don't know what the security staff is like during night hours.  And also, this review is strictly to inform future customers, based on what I have observed that day.  By no means it was meant to be offensive.  But anyhow, I parked here for about three hours, and the total was $12.45, which is quite reasonable via this location.</text><Date>1427437027511<//Date>< gmap_id>

Got an early bird special for $18, but it can go up to 29... if not more! Parking is underground and opens all doors at 6am! Seems okay, but not the safest place to be leaving your car. 😉</Review>

<text>This place is a joke. I have ordered sandwich without lettuce because of the e coli outbreak. He made the sandwich with lettuce, then noticed the order was without, so he just took out the meat and cheese from the order with lettuce putting it into a new sandwich. Complete joke. If someone says without lettuce, they should just make new order. Don't ever go to this place.<//text>< user>

Very good place to grab a quick, small priced quality Philly. If you come near closing time, the crowd is MUCH thinner if you don't feel like waiting. My go-to at the Great Mall!< /review>

<Review>The chicken sub was okay. My review is 3.5/5.  I should've tried the steak. I heard that the steak subs are the best. Go for steak. Other than that, great customer service. The worker gave me a free refill. Me and my friends will be back because of that.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808fceca2907aa0b:0x4f583b4cd9addba7< /gmap_id><Date>1493334242131< /Date>< username>

Argued for 10 mins..  I said i dont want this drink and i havnt even touched it . still he said pay the difference . i said your employee messed uo with the order.   And i want what i order not this.  And they denied that. I dont think i ever gave a 1 star to any1 before .<//Review>

There is not enough meat or cheese. A real cheese steak doesn't have mayo lettuce or tomatoes but they use it as fillers for the lack of the meat and cheese. If it was a hoggie shop maybe 3 stars.</text>

<text>Great experience overall. My partner and I were looking for an engagement ring and this popped up as one of the top 3 rated in the OC area. We had the pleasure of working with Jimmy who was friendly and very knowledgeable. It took a while to narrow down the style but he was very patient and paid attention to what I was specifically looking for. We ended up walking away with a GORGEOUS oval cut with beautiful intricate detailing. They also have a cool selfie wall for anyone who wants to capture the moment and post on social media. This place had great customer service and provided nice amenities (chilled drinks, cookies, etc). If you are searching for an engagement ring, look no further! They've got quite the unique selection</text><user>104755175084983588903< /user><Resp>None</Resp>< time>

He has such a good knowledge of his stock and what can be made in-house that you will have every confidence in finding your dream piece. Not only was he able to find the perfect stone (and Jimmy the genius was able to break down the value of my stone and explain how they are appraised), but he was genuinely interested in the how I was going to propose. He even helped me workshop my idea and was excited to meet my fiancée. I have already been back for other purchases. Every employee is happy to be there and helpful.

I love this place! Corey has helped my husband in several occasions pick out jewelry for me. He even helped my husband put together my engagement ring. I totally recommend this store, they have great prices and everyone is very friendly. Corey even put together a wish list for me so my husband can buy the things I like. Awesome store!</Text>

Linda was amazing.   Literally every single person there is amazing.  I’ve been coming here for a few years now.  I would never even think of going anywhere else.  It’s not worth it. This family owned business really knows the meaning of “customer service”!  It has no equal.  Not even close!</Review>

Got my necklace fixed and it broke in the same place but they refused to fix it again stating that it was not the same place. I was happy at first with the quick turn around time but now I'm not happy.< /Review>

<Text>I had the most amazing experience designing my wedding band with Jimmy. I knew what I wanted to create and he made it happen! My parents have been going to Jeweler’s Touch for over 30, where they designed their wedding rings, and I’m so glad I followed in their steps. We have always been treated like family by everyone there. This is the most wonderful jeweler. You won’t regret letting them take care of any jewelry need.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I wanted a necklace custom made based on the design of a costume piece that I really liked. As soon as I came through the door. Jessica, my jeweler was incredibly attentive, creative, patient and efficient. She made the process enjoyable and the finished product was just beautiful and exactly what I had hoped for. And even better was the option for 0% financing for 12 months. Thank you Jewelers Touch. I’m more than pleased with this experience.< /Review>

Different than any other jewelry store, this place is inviting, rather than intimidating. The staff is friendly and helpful, yet not at all overbearing or pushy as we’ve experienced elsewhere. Every time we have been in here for our engagement/wedding rings the staff-especially Jessica-has been more than welcoming and accommodating. We had a very specific vision and she helped us create our dream set. We will be back for any and all future jewelry needs!<//review>

They are very helpful in assisting you find different designs and styles that fit your taste.  They have a nice selection. They have a feature where they will put information about a piece you liked in the computer on your wish list, so when you come back you have the details regarding the things you liked.</review>

I absolutely love this jewelry store. The individuals who assist you are amazing. Jessica was so very helpful. She guided us to the areas that I was interested.  Jessica used a mirror so I was able to view my purchase.  Once again my visit to Jeweler’s Touch was 5+ stars!</text>

Copious amount of detail and care was taken into consideration for my purchase. I wasn't hounded or pushed to make a decision as a car salesman would. I bought the piece of jewelry I had decided upon because it was a great price and I felt well taken care of by the knowledgeful staff. I will return to buy more jewelry. Go to Jeweler's Touch and get your stuff there instead of anywhere else.<//Text>

<response>None< /response><review>I cannot be more pleased with the service I received from Jeweler's Touch! I completely bent both my wedding band and engagement ring, so much so that a side diamond fell out (and was lost). I also micro-cracked the engagement ring in a few spots. I chose Jeweler's Touch since it is a local family owned business with great reviews. I just walked in and they gave me a free quote within minutes. I dropped my ring off and they quoted me a week to complete the repairs. Not only were they done 3 days sooner than they quoted, but the price was a bit less than what they originally quoted too! They not only fixed my rings, but tightened all of the diamond baskets and re-rhodium plated both rings. My rings look like they are brand new, straight out of the case! Thank you!<//review></record>

Jewelers Touch is the best jewelry store! They are always fully staffed with friendly knowledgeable gemologist and salespeople.

German was professional and courteous. His estimates were spot on and he let us know the best ways to save money and avoid extra future costs. The work of the jeweler was fantastic and made my wife’s ring look as beautiful as it looked almost 25 years ago when I proposed. All in a timely manner.  I highly recommend them.</review>

<Text>Took my engagement ring in for an appraisal and resizing. It fits perfectly and the work is clean. The appraisal pricing was fair too. Everything took about a week and a half and they called me when my ring was ready. The staff is also super nice, knowledgeable and efficient. I'm in and out quickly for both the drop off and pick up. Highly recommend!</Text>< Time>

<text>This store saved my life! My wedding is a week away and the jeweler who custom made my engagement ring and band is all the way in Glendale. I went to Jewelers Touch minutes before they were closing on a Friday night, because I needed my engagement ring to be re-dipped in rhodium, so it would be as shiny as my wedding band. I struggled to find a jeweler who would take my ring, that was made by someone else. Flynn was willing to help me, and had my ring done in less than 24 hours. I am so thankful for their quick service and Flynn’s help. My ring looks AMAZING! Thank you so much!!!!< /text><rating>5<//rating>< Name>

He's amazingly knowledgeable and helpful.

I was looking for a watch repair and I luck out and found Jeweler's Touch.
The people there are very knowledgeable and professional. I took my three watches to be check out for repair. It took a short time to examine the watches and came back to explain what each watch had to be done.They made it easy for me to make a good decision and gave me good advice . They also were able to save me some money on a repair on one of my watches. THANKS< /review>

<Review>Great service! Never been disappointed with their customer service. Employees are warm and friendly. I might be bias, but Corey helped me with my engagement ring and has been my go to guy since. Corey goes above and beyond his job by calling and texting you with information, updates, and or simply to say Hi.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rating>

Had the most amazing experience with Jessica. My husband and I have been married for 32 years and wanted to purchase a new wedding ring. Jessica helped us by explaining everything and being upfront and honest with us. We appreciate being treated like one of the family. Thanks to everyone for taking the time with us and never making us feel rushed.</Review>

I went in to look at bracelets for a gift for my daughter.  Jimmy was just fantastic at helping me find what I needed for her.  I was really so relieved that he knew exactly how to help me and I ended up with the most beautiful engraved bracelet that I know my daughter will love!  The personal attention that you all give is just wonderful.  Thank you so much!<//Review>

Amazing. I crushed my wedding ring and was devastated. I ordered a more durable wedding band while I was waiting for maintenance on my ring, and my ring came out good as new before I even finished putting the order in for the new band. On top of that, the price of the reshaping and cleaning was complimentary! Fast and personable even when they’re busy. I went in heartbroken and came out relieved and happy all within a 15-20 minute time span. I understand why they are rated so high.< /Text>

Myself and my girlfriend sat with Flynn for 2 hours as we discussed dislikes and likes. We came up with a style and because of their custom designs. My girl was able to get what she wanted. I will be coming back for my ring as well as other jewelry in the future. I highly recommend this be your first stop.</review><GmapID>0x80dcd4724142935b:0xd2db7abed7d109a5</GmapID><UserId.>115987098209951086818</UserId.>< name>

The staff at Jeweler's touch were absolutely wonderful to work with. I had 2 rings that needed attention. Added birthstones and replacement of some , on my "grandma's ring, and another that was 30 years  old , that went with a matching pendant. Both came out like new if not better. I believe my jeweler was Joy. So personable!  Love this shop!!</text>

Worked with Jessica, she has the best personality! We were offered water immediatley upon arriving, my daughter was given a coloring book and crayons to keep her busy. Another lady kept my daughter occupied and gave her a cute bag of different types of rocks. She loved it. We found a beautiful semi mount that we purchased. Best experience with a jewelry store. Will definitely be going back for all my jewelry purchases!!</text>

Jessica was very helpful today. Needed to get watch fixed. Then also needed to buy a new chain for my necklace. The clasp on the chain was coming up to the front by the pendant at least 4 times. Jessica helped me pick a new open. Will keep my fingers crossed this one works. Would recommend this jewelry store to others. They are very knowledgeable and helpful.</review>

<text>I was shopping for an engagement ring about a year ago. I started with Robbins Bros, then Jared’s, then another smaller store near me. In all 3 stores, it was totally a sales environment - pressured, don’t let you leave, and almost felt like you were being pressured to buy what they had. Not at Jeweler’s Touch.

Super friendly staff, no pressure WHATSOEVER, they let you take your time, and their selection is awesome for a lot of different price ranges. Pam helped us out and personalized the experience so much. She text me to follow up with me and even remind me about stuff which I really appreciated. She was always available and offered insight and valuable perspective. It really felt like getting advice from a family friend. I highly recommend this place expecially.</text><response>None</response></record>

The staff at Jeweler's Touch was insanely helpful and accommodating. Shout out to Jimmy Cleveland for directing me to the perfect engagement ring for my [now] fiancé. Thank you Pam for your help in resizing our ring and for the very quick turnaround completing it same day during a holiday weekend. Visit Jeweler's Touch if you want to find the perfect piece for your significant other. They will treat you like family and you won't leave disappointed.</Text>

<review>My (now) fiancé and I had the most amazing experience, I cannot recommend this place enough! Corey and Jessica helped us and they were absolutely wonderful. They helped us stay within our price range and explained to us all the options we had. We couldn't have found the perfect ring if it weren't for them. They helped everything line up perfectly for us. Everyone here is so personable and caring. We will definitely be returning here for wedding bands and anything else we may need over the years. A big thank you to everyone who works here, you all go above and beyond! We'll be recommending this store to everyone we know!<//review><user_id>100698563459036039690<//user_id>< Pictures>

We are really impressed by the quality and their commitment to making sure we were happy with our custom design.  In fact, my ring is more beautiful than I even expected it to be.  I definitely recommend them and we will for sure come back for future purchases.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>I heard about Jeweler's Touch from their funny commercials on the radio for years, so when it came time to get a custom wedding band for my wife, I knew where I wanted to go. We worked with Jason who walked us through the process, from concept to model to final product. They were transparent throughout the whole thing and everybody there is so nice. They also have a nice snack spread and coffee while you wait or browse, so there is a very inviting atmosphere about the place. Their prices, to be honest, might be on the high side, but you pay a premium to get premium service, that that is exactly what they provide at Jeweler's Touch.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This is the best jewelry store. They have a great selection of beautiful jewelry, and they fix your jewelry where you can watch them. Corey is the best. I highly recommend him if you are looking to buy or repair your jewelry.<//Text>

Time and again the good people at Jeweler's Touch have made it easy and fun (yes, fun) to get jewelry for my now wife. I've designed my wife's engagement and wedding rings here.

No hard sells and no pressure to finance everything like Jared and other places. That's because JT has actual gemologists and do the work at their store. Most other places are just store fronts for financing plans, that's where they make their real money. It's easy to support local when they're better than the big chains.<//text>

My grandson purchased a wedding ring set on Dec 23 and was assisted by Pam , due to a time constraint he asked me if I could pickup for him and I said of course ...had to work later than expected so I called Pam to see what time they would open in the morning  ...Well imagine my surprise when Pam told me that she lived in our neighboring town and she would be happy to deliver to me at my home ...true to her word and in the rain no less here she came directly to my home ..I WAS IMPRESSED !! What a fantastic saleslady Pam is , friendly and very personable . We will definitely be doing more business with Jewelers Touch  Thank you again Pam , for making this happen !

Jeweler's Touch created a beautiful ring out of old gold that I no longer wore and one mabe pearl earring (lost the other). So many compliments! My platinum pearl earrings that I purchased there have been with me for more than 15+years. They have beautiful jewelry and fabulous service!</review>

Outrageous!!! I walked in wanting to look at wedding bands for my fiancé. Walked out with my jewelry cleaned (haven't seen it look that good since I got it), a bracelet for my daughter and her sister, a necklace for my maid of honor (daughter), a bracket for my ring and his wedding band. They were fantastic from the moment we walked in to us walking out. Talk about going above and beyond to please a customer. Coffee, water and snacks were also offered. My 15 year old was happy so everyone was happy. When you go to visit the shop ask for Jessica. Loved my experience there as did the other two with me oh and she was really discrete about my daughters maid of honor gift.<//text>

Jewelers Touch did a fantastic job of engraving both my wedding and engagement rings. I contacted countless other jewelers trying to find one who could engrave on my very thin 2mm engagement band and everyone else told me that it was impossible. Well they made the impossible possible! Not only that, but they were able to get it done in time as I was in the area only a short while. Also they have fantastic customer service. I would definitely come here again for any of my jewelry needs!</Review>< Response>

Top quality, friendly helpful environment. I've purchased and had a few things repaired at  Jewelers touch. The latest was my 86 year-old mothers wedding ring which the main Center Diamond was missing. It was in rough shape being 64 years that she has had it. On September 2nd  it will be 3 years  since we lost  her husband and my father and I didn't realize she wasn't wearing her wedding ring, but another  inexpensive ring  that she had been wearing  because her wedding ring was so damaged .  I always thought she was just wearing her wedding ring upside down. Jewelers touch replated it, replace the diamond, built up the studs, and it looks beautiful when it was done! I highly recommend them for fine jewelry, restoration and repairs.</Review>

<review>I met Jessica Nassif in the store. She is a very kind and professional person. She helped me pick the two sets of earrings that my husband gave me as gift. I will definitely go back to her and recommend anyone that wishes to have friendly and kind services go ask for her. Cheers< /review>< pics>

Corey and I texted back and fourth a few times and he sent me several ideas and then we had the perfect ring ready within DAYS. He shipped it right to my girl friend without her knowing, under a sneaky address. It was the perfect surprise and the ring is top notch, truly stunning. I couldn't have been any happier or been met with better customer service. 100% will recommend, and will be a lifetime customer.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Second time coming here, the first was for a watch battery replacement and cleaning, and this time was to size a ring. Great service, and quality work.</Review>

The Jewler's touch was a fantastic experience, they took great care of me and offered the best possible service. After another jeweler treated me poorly I was referred here and couldn't have been happier with the service or the ring I got from them, and at a great price.</Text>

<text>There was a little mishap with the first ring I had chosen for my fiancée. But that didn’t stop jeweler’s touch in redeeming themselves and showed me terrific service by helping me out with the issue. I’ll be visiting Jeweler’s touch again.</text>< Pictures>

Me and my husband walk into Jeweler’s Touch to get repair my broken ring, my ring was repaired while we waited in the store. They cleaned my ring at no cost. We were extremely happy with their service. Highly recommended!<//Review>

<text>I purchased my fiancé's engagement ring and our wedding bands from Jeweler's Touch and I couldn't have been more satisfied with my experience.  I worked with Corey for all the purchases and he was great.  He worked with me on my budget and helped me choose what my fiancé calls the "perfect ring."  We definitely recommend Corey and Jeweler's Touch to all our friends and family.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dcd4724142935b:0xd2db7abed7d109a5< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Our Jeweler Jessica was very attentive, stuck with me help me design a beautiful ring for my beautiful fiancee. However the ring was a little bit big once my fiance tried it on so we came in to have it resized, everyone was very friendly and it was a very quick process. We walked out the same day with the ring resized and a satisfied fiancee< /Text>< Pictures>

Growing up in YL, my siblings and I came to JT w/Dad for holidays and special events to pick out jewelry for Mom. Now as adults living in both North and South OC we come in regularly. Everyone here treats you like family, the jewelry is beautiful, and they have also created customized pieces for us. Thank you Jewelers Touch for all the special memories you've created for my family over the years. Truly appreciated!<//review>

<time>1510789916577<//time><Review>I must give the ultimate praise to Tony Vorell who assisted me. 3 years ago I let the most precious diamond with Tony until I decided what special setting I would choose. For this diamond was given to me by my true love 52 years ago as my engagement ring. It was brought to my attention that the jewelery store had probaby sold it by now. In a panic for many months I finally walked in the store and asked to speak to Tony. I gave him my name and he said oh sure, I still have it!! I couldn't believe it. At that point I said let's get it into a setting now. Cory then assisted me with the best service and I received my precious diamond the next day and is it beautiful !
THE JEWELER'S TOUCH IS SO REPUTABLE, HONEST AND THE ULTIMATE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. Please see their wonderful jewelry!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Jewels Touch has always been my families favorite Jewerly Store. Since moving to South Dakota we still use them and ship our Jewerly back to them. Corey has been our go to and has done nothing but give us everything we want and more. Excellent customer service and outstanding Jewerly. I highly r commend them.</Text>

J'sT is sending it to Citizen for repair. Tony put a battery in my 50-year-old mini Accutron clock. While there, I spotted a flashy bracelet in the 50% off case. What a deal it was with my $50 Anniversary certificate applied to the final price. My husband is always afraid for me to stop in at J'sT for batteries or repairs - LOL!

Best taqueria around!!! Everything tastes fresh and is full of flavor from the veggies to the meats! That means a lot because I'm from San Francisco where there are TONS of good taquerias. This is the only one I go to in the area.</Text>

Super great service!   It wasn’t their fault at all but they made a whole new burrito because I asked for a change after it was already prepared.  When I figured out that it was already made I told them not to worry about it but they insisted on making another.  Super fast too!  Will go back!</review>

<Text>So disappointed! Paid $65 for a tray of 50 taquitos for the office and the taquitos were half the size of a normal one. So in reality I paid $65 for 25. The guacamole was nice and chunky but some of the pieces of avocado were not even chopped and were still green! What happened? First visit the food was excellent, second time not good, third time really good, but this time it was pretty bad. Need to be more consistent with your cooks to make sure quality is the same every time. It's so hit or miss I don't think I'm going to chance another visit especially because it's not cheap.<//Text>< pictures>

Came on a Tuesday for lunch and their taco Tuesdays are only after 5pm which was a minus. They should call it taco evenings... Ordered the super taco El pastor and was a bit disappointed as it only added sour cream and beans for twice the price and the El pastor itself was on the bland side. I may have expected too much when they called it super. Bigger taco perhaps? Anyways ... The chips and salsa were enjoyable though. Tasted fresh and crispy and the salsa flavorful but not overwhelming.  Overall average experience. Might need to go again to try their other items.< /review>

This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area, we’re there all the time. Delicious food, great margaritas, no complaints. I’d rate them higher if I could. ❤️< /Text>

Service is always friendly, the salsa is very good, and they just added onto the bar and added a TV.  Perfect Taqueria for a bite or dinner with the family.<//Text>< Pics>

They have more wet salsas at the chip bar so if you like it chunky, you might want to look elsewhere, otherwise the meat is tender and the burritos have a nice balance to them when you're eating it, you don't get overwhelmed by there being a surprise slob of sour cream, they make it good.<//text></record></dataset><record>

This is my favorite Mexican place! They have a full menu, really good recipes that make everything tasty, and very friendly staff.  You can also get a beer or something harder if you desire.</Review>

Man I really don't like bashing places but again this is just my opinions and might help them get back on track, that being said, the person that was at the register was really helpful this being my first time in this place so I ordered what they had suggested the carnitas in a burrito it was was really greasy and the meat wasn't as crispy as I like it to be it also had a couple of pieces cartilage and a bone in it and the chip and salsa bar looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while, food on the floor, the bathroom smelled,  food inventory just there right on the counter right above the trash cans the employees in kitchen not wearing gloves and coming to work the register I couldn't see if they had wash their hands when they went back to kitchen and that's why a two star rating.<//Text>

Easily one of the best Mexican food restaurants in Roseville. I will definitely be back. The soft tacos are amazing. I got a carne asada and Al Pastor taco. Both were on point. And the nachos are really good too!</Review>

<Review>Great place for Mexican food especially if your not looking for a party atmosphere like at El Tapatio. El Sombrero will most likely have whatever you are looking for food wise. Although they have combination plates, you can also have them make what you want to your specifications. They have all the meats you want. Their Mexican rice is awesome. And you can have your choice of black or pinto refried beans. The cost of the food is all very reasonable. Though they are often busy, seating is usually not a problem.<//Review><Date>1542646527221<//Date>< name>

<Text>My first impressions of this place are: The food was well prepared and decently tasty. The atmosphere was also as expected for a Taqueria and was clean and maintained. The price was a bit high though, with an unexpected extra $1 "dinner" charge added to the combination plate I had ordered. Since I had ordered just after 4pm I asked cashier about the change couldn't explain what it was for or if it was constant or  came into effect at a certain hour. This is the only Taqueria I've been to with a extra fee on their combo plates and it really detracted from the experience. I  might return to this location but I certainly won't be ordering a combo plate next time.<//Text>< pictures>

Incredible taco deal on Tuesdays. One of the best tacos in town other than my wife's. This place has such a grest menu, awesome chip bar, and super friendly staff.

I think they need some salsa that's not so spicy and they where out of the drink I wanted but they where very gracious in offering to re-make my sons tacos without the salsa since it was too spicy for him.

I believe my family and I will be regulars here now, they have such great quality food and the prices are pretty fair considering the area and quality of food.

They also have a big selection of beer available I was tempted tempted to order one but $4.00 for one Sol was a little spendy, I would of paid 3.25 no problem but I'm not much of a beer drinker.</text>

I love this place so much. It is my go to Mexican restaurant. When I lived across the street I would frequent this place probably 4 times a week.
I come from Salinas where you get true authentic Mexican food and when I moved to the Sacramento area I couldn't find that anywhere till I visited this place.
Their food is fresh, and always has an amazing flavor.
The owners and workers are so friendly and kind. They gave me a shirt for free for going there so often.
And when my father got very sick, he couldn't eat anything. He didn't want to come here cause he never had an appetite. I watched him eat an entire plate and then order left overs. Now when he comes and visits from Salinas he always asks to go to el sombrero while we are here.
The Linares' s love you guys! It's like a little piece of a home away from home for me! Don't change a bit!</review>

I called in to place an order, I was put on hold for a very long time while he was taking orders. I get that, that's fine I guess. What I didn't like was that after he ring me up for my 9 tacos, he never gave me a price. I asked and he told me $23.xx. Right after he gave me the price, he said that he's really busy, as if I was asking too much when I asked for the total. He repeatedly asked what my order was because he wasn't paying attention to me, the customer, and giving me his undivided attention. After he said he was really busy I said "okay, you're really busy" he said no do you want them? Yes or no? I said, "no have a good day". Horrible customer service, $23 for nine tacos? HA!< /review>

When i called to let the man know, he bluntly accused me of saying "shredded beef." That's a far cry from "carne asada." Word to the wise.

Smh the only thing good was the rice... Enchiladas were OK they are really tiny and they were very hard to cut I had to just pick a The whole enchilada and eat  it all at once...

Never coming here again . Carne asada tacos didn't even taste like carne asada tacos , they tasted bland . Chicken tacos were just tacos with white meat that could have been shredded  off a Wal-Mart rotessorie chicken . Fish tacos are flavorless . I ordered a torta , which is a Mexican sandwich and it came to me cold and soggy . They let my sandwich sit on the plate until the bread ripped apart . On a good note , churros were good . Other than that not worth it .</Text>

Summary: Quality is good, taste is good (but varies by item), value is excellent. The staff is friendly, but food production was slow when I went on a Thursday evening (one cook and three others).  The restaurant also had large flies flying around (including in the kitchen). Good, but not the best I've ever had.

I went here on a Thursday at around 7pm and there were two other people eating in the restaurant. In order to sample the wares, I decided to try a carne asada, carnitas, al pastor, and chicken soft taco. The total for the four came to about $9.60.  I then filled up my little bag with chips and took some salsas to go, and sat down to wait for my food to be ready.

There were two girls working the register and cleaning up/delivering food items, and one woman cooking the food (another non-cook appeared from the back later).  The cook was hard at work building a large to-go order, and it took about 15 minutes for me to get my four tacos. In the meantime, a couple of parties with kids arrived and placed their orders and sat down to eat at the restaurant. Unfortunately, flies were flying around and getting on myself and the other guests.

When my food was ready, I took it home and began eating. The chunky salsa was good, the tomatillo was my favorite, and the thinner red salsa was alright.  The carne asada and al pastor were my favorite. Tasty, nice textures, and good quality.  The al pastor had a slight sweetness from the marinade, which worked well. The carnitas and chicken were both very tender, but didn't have a lot of flavor, unfortunately. Still, for the price, it was a pretty good dinner and a solid value.< /text>

The food was great I got the quesobirria and mulita both were awesome. Also they have a dessert place a few doors down with same name and website and they have amazing desserts that are very unique. The picture is a churro sundae it was fantastic.</text>

Delicious! The menu was amazing and the items we purchased were mouth watering. For sure will be coming back. Traveled over an hour to try the dessert portion of the business. 11/10.</review>

Visited after seeing them on Good Day Sacramento. Excellent customer service, good food large portions, and they make their own ice cream! I ordered the super chicken quesadilla, pineapple fresca, with a scoop of cookie monster ice cream. I recommend this place, worth the drive from Sac.</Review>

The staff was tired after their dinner rush (understandable), they forgot to give us our drinks then forgot to give us extra stuff we paid for on the side. When the food arrived it wasn't as hot as other restaurants. Serving portions for the price were good.  I told them just cilantro & green mild sauce & all of the tacos had a spicy red sauce poured over them.  I tried to eat them but my mouth was burning. The surf & turf super burrito was extremely mushy like they blended everything then poured it into a burrito. The Spanish rice tasted like white rice. A couple of bites were so bland it made my stomach turn because it tasted the way wet paper towels smell. The asada fries came with a spoon & soon we seen why.  There was a  juice settled at the bottom that made the fries wet & soggy. It was like eating asada fries soup. We will NOT be back for hot food. We will be back to try dessert!<//text>

Saw this on the Stockton Savings Pass app and gave it a try just because it had a deal available. I fell in love with it since then. I also got my brother to love their carne asada fries. Their shrimp burritos are also a must try. Customer service is superb, it is family-owned and one can really witness the passion they put into the business. This is definitely not just another #mexicanrestaurant< /text>

<Text>I've traveled to many places , both locally and nationally that claim to be authentic and fresh. They failed or have a different definition of authentic or fresh. I have come here since the beginning. I have introduced new people to this establishment who can all agree let's this is the best mexican food I've ever tasted. I was taught buy some Great Cooks that great tasting food is not always about the ingredients in it but about the love. These people love what they do. May God bless them and all their business endeavors continue to allow their business to prosper from generation to generation.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>To the owner,
The price for a Mangonada compared to the size they gave me is ridiculous. I would reconsider portion sizes. Three tiny scoops of ice cream, about six small chunks of mango, some Tajín, and chamoy with a candy for $6, is truly unbelievable. When I went back to request one more scoop of ice cream, the excuse was they ran out of the correct sized cups. Still at that, what I got was not the same as what I seen sitting on the counter to be given to a different customer or what I seen a different customer come  out with, or what I have gotten other times before.< /Review><userid>108291442335146907629<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Their fries are super thick so I didn’t really care for them, and the cheese on them wasn’t all the way melted. The burritos were okay, I really love the tortillas though. Their shrimp tacos weren’t good. I loved the nachos though. The nachos were so good. The drinks are perfect.<//text>

Me and my mom agreed that we found our new taco spot. I had a vampiro that was recommended by my sister. It was delicious crunchy, good amount of cheese and topped off with yummy seasoned asada. My mom had a lengua and tripas taco and said it has been one of the best she has ever ate. Agua de limón and pepino was fresh and delicious.</review>

For future reference, you may want to change the wax paper used for takeout. The entire paper was stuck to the tortilla.  That meant I either not eat the Gringo or else eat some paper. I choose the latter, however, the Carne Asada was very chewy. Yor may want to consider marinating the meat longer  so it is more tender.<//Review>

Guys this place is NO JOKE! I heard about this amazing restaurant on Google and I had to check it out. Their tacos are AMAZING!!! I got a lengua, adobo, and carnitas tacos, super burrito and crepe for dessert. I've never had tacos this good before. Meat is super tender and the carnitas are amazing and crispy. Super burrito HUGE! Same with the crepe! If you've seen the pictures of the crepes, it's REAL! It's big and delicious!</text>

<Review>This place is wonderful! Staff is always friendly. The food is absolutely great! I love the carne asada fries and the cucumber drink. The tacos and fresh tortillas are pretty food too. I didnt care so much for the ice cream flavors they had. I had to go through quite a few just to go back to vanilla haha overall i really love coming here and hope they stay around!</Review>< rating>

The first time I was there I got tacos de carnitas and they were very good...my 2nd time the there I got the carnitas fries and Oh man!, was it delicious the carnitas are tender juicy and crisp not too crisp just right and there juicy not dry or hard overall I've had a really GREAT EXPERIENCE and VERY SATISFIED....the wait is pretty long as it is a small business with ALOT of business and it DEFINITELY in my opinion "WORTH THE WAIT!!" Thank You El Frutal 👍</text>

They took over 30 min to make a smoothie and they even forgot about it because their friends came in, a bunch of kids running the place and attitudes won't ever be back smoothie was really good sadly to say customer service plays a big part<//review>

The tortillas and chips are handmade, the dishes are delicious, and the ice cream is very tasty. Mangonadas are the bomb, as well as the horchata.< /review>

Great experience, exceeded my highest expectations. Consistent communication that kept me well advised of every step of the process. It was a very professional experience, and yet made you feel like family. Connor, not only is an exceptional attorney. During the process we also developed a good friendship. In hope's in anyone reading this review. You can feel very comfortable and relaxed working with Connor and his extrordinary proffesionalism. He will work for you as he did me.</Review>

<Review>I was in a bike accident in San Jacinto, it was a four way stop sign I was in a bike lane I was the first one there at the intersection nobody was there yet I started going across and a car went through the stop sign and hit me on the side, I got lucky, I almost didn’t get a lawyer but I’m sure glad I did,my bike was totaled and I was pretty scraped up and bruised ,
So I looked up a local lawyer and saw
Mr Van Orders previews and I liked what I saw he had great reviews so I was sold
And I gave him a call he did a great job
Thank you Mr Van Order..<//Review>< pics>

<review>So surprised that this place got 5 stars review after my recent experience with them. My wife got rear ended and was severely injured. When i called this law office, the lady who answered the phone asked me one question “do you guys have full coverage or liability insurance only” , I told her we have liability, but the party who was at fault had full coverage, her immediate answer was “ sorry we can’t help you because you only have liability coverage”. It’s either the lady had no clue about personal injury law, or they have way enough business to don’t care about getting new one. I called another, and they were so eager to work on my case right away.</review><gmapID>0x80db6f45a54e3d93:0x11c79df66f13b7a5</gmapID><date>1581099922504< /date><resp>None<//resp><rate>1<//rate></record>

Mr. Van Order and his entire practice are very professional and thorough. I felt comfortable and trusted Mr. Van Order would successfully handle my case, in fact, he went above and beyond my expectations.
Mr. Van Order takes the time to explain the legal process in easy to understand terms. I was always kept informed of how my case was progressing and given time frames for when the next step would be taken. I never had to request a status update.
I highly recommend Mr. Van Order for legal matters requiring an attorney.< /text>

I found this law firm in the telephone book. I have no idea who they were but set up an appointment to meet  mr Van order. He made me feel very comfortable he is shirred me he knew what he was doing I felt trust and told him to proceed in my personal injury accident claim. I was not insured at the time for health insurance he found me medical doctors who would work based on the claim.  The driver who hit me head attorneys who fought us every step of the way and he always had time to return calls or emails. As with mini personal injury cases it took almost 2 years to reach a settlement. Wants Conor O’Brien  Took over the deposition portion and the mediation portion I found he was incredibly easy to work with knowledgeable of my claim and knew exactly how to proceed to do the best for me the client. In the end I got more than expected and exactly what I needed and I can highly recommend  them both !<//Text>

I have been very pleased with everything that Attorney Van Order has done for me.  Furthermore, my friends and family who I have referred to him have told me the same.  He is by far the best around and I encourage you to seek him if you are in need of a great attorney.</review>

I called Advanced Plumbing after getting an extremely high quote from a different company. They came to my home  first to light the pilot on my water heater and then replace my water heater.  They were on time and professional both times. They were thorough. The prices were very reasonable. (I CALLED AT LEAST 7 DIFFERENT COMPANIES)  They have a great professional schedules that will definitely meet yours.  I recommend Advanced Plumbing. AND they will be ready to work!</Text>

A few days ago, I noticed that a portion of the front yard was soaked with water with some pudding near the house around our tree and shrubs.  I made sure that the sprinklers were not leaking and that left only one possible source of the water and that would have to be the main water supply to the house.  I called Advanced Plumbing by chance and that same day Jason came out to take a look.  He was very pleasant and helpful.  He turned the main water supply off at the house and checked the water meter near the street.  The meter showed that water was still passing at a rate of .2 of a cubic foot per minute.  Jason showed me and explained that it could only be a leak in the main water supply.  Jason then checked the water pressure at the garden hose spigot, it was a little low.  He told me that he could replace the main supply piping and would email me an estimate.  I called other plumber services and another company came out and without checking the meter or water pressure told me that I needed a new water supply line.  Another company used Google maps satellite view to look at my house and gave me a quote without even coming out to meet.

Jason emailed an estimate in a short time and called me to follow up if I had any questions.  The estimate was not the lowest however Jason was the only person to actually diagnose where the water was leaking.  Later that day I called Jason and we booked the job.  Jason told me that he would come out the next morning at 10:00.  He called before 10:00 to tell me he would be about an hour late.  Forty five minutes later Jason arrived and began work.  He replaced the leaking PVC plastic line that was 30 plus years old with a new copper line.  He was always friendly and answered all of my questions.  There was minimal intrusion in our lawn or landscape.  He and a helper completed the job in approximately four hours, turned our water back on and leak checked all connections.  I was very pleased with the service Jason and Advanced Plumbing provided.  I would recommend them to others.</Text>

<text>When I discovered water on our garage floor, I was quickly able to discover the source of the problem: our water heater.  I called Advanced Plumbing around 9:00 a.m.  I was greeted by a kind and patient woman who informed me that she had a technician available whom could respond immediately.  I was happily shocked.  Our technician, Cesar, arrived in less than an hour with an assistant.  He promptly diagnosed the problem, and we discussed some different alternatives.  Ultimately, I agreed to have Advanced Plumbing replace my water heater, which was about 14 years old.  Cesar said he would leave to pick up a new water heater and only asked that I move some items to give him some additional workspace upon his return.  Cesar and his assistant were probably gone for an hour when they returned and promptly went to work.  They quickly installed our new water, took away our old one, and gave me some instructions on the new unit.  They had finished the job by 12:30 p.m.  Needless to say, I was thoroughly impressed by Cesar and his assistant’s quick work and professionalism, and will strongly recommend Advanced Plumbing to others.  Should the need arise, I will certainly call upon them again.<//text>< Rate>

We had such a great experience with our plumber! He was on time and very professional. He installed our new toilet and actually leveled it because our floors were not level. He was in and out within an hour. So quick and so clean! Will definitely use them again!<//review>

<Text>The main water line to our house broke and left us without water. Cole from Advanced Plumbing came out, was able to quickly fix the pipe, and did a great job. He even used all the parts that I had on hand. No upsell, great work, fast, polite, and competent. This was just a simple pipe repair but I was impressed and will be reaching out to them in the future for my plumbing needs. Thank you, Cole! I never realized how much I miss running water :-)</Text><Time>1626472009778</Time>< user_id>

<response>None<//response><Time>1623090219180</Time><Name>Otis Osborne< /Name><text>We recently incurred a major plumbing failure of our entire plumbing system installed in the concrete slab foundation of our home in the Diamond Grove area. Fortunately, we contracted with Advanced Plumbing who performed this major job in a timely and high-quality manner. Their foreman, Cesar Perez, was awesome and led his team of plumbers, Marco & Noe, to complete this entire project in only 5 days. Their workmanship was superior in every aspect, and they went to great lengths to minimize disruption to our home. Cesar also subcontracted the repair/replacement and painting of all impacted drywall areas which had to be cut open in order to cap-off the failed plumbing system and completely replace it with a new flex “bypass” system throughout the home. This drywall & painting was outstandingly accomplished by the firm of O.C.A Painting and its supervisor Israel Godinez.
Caesar was a very patient and customer-oriented person who took great pains to explain all his team’s actions, and to allay all of our concerns and fears of potential damage to our home. It is an amazing testimony to the skills of this team that we have had a hard time locating any evidence of their massive extent of work—our home was left in an immaculate condition, thanks also to the finishing effort of their office manager—Ashley Simpson— who performed the final clean-up duties!
In conclusion, what could have been an absolute catastrophe ended up as a very positive experience and our home was left in top condition and with a completely new plumbing system!! It should be also pointed out that this was done in a very timely and professional manner by the entire team! We would recommend them without reservation to anyone looking to re-plumb their home. Fantastic job!! They also performed this job in accordance with their initially agreed upon timeline< /text><GmapID>0x80853ce8a7b74d4f:0x4e19fe7e48396cf8</GmapID>< user>

< Review>
They were scheduled to show between 11-2 on a Saturday.  They showed up at 10:35.  We were just getting home and pleasantly surprised.  Cole was waiting at the door.  Didn't even look 18 years old.  But I explained the problem and Cole went to work.  He finished and was out the door before 11:57.  He was the 3rd plumber we tried.  The first one was a nightmare.  The second one just couldn't finish the job.  Third time was a charm.  Thanks to Amy and Cole at Advanced plumbing.<//Review>

Cal was so thorough in investigating our disposal and gas water heater situation!!  I appreciated him going the extra mile to check things out and give me an update and report.  I can tell he loves the work he does and takes a personal interest in it.  I am so thankful he helped us when we were far away.  Above and beyond!!  Excellent service!! I highly recommend this company.</Text>

This is the first time I've written a review for anything. They rushed to get a technician to my home for what I thought was a serious problem. They had good integrity and stated I has misdiagnosed my issue (which would have costed a lot of money) and directed me in the right path to fix my actual issue. Saving me a ton of money and time. I would highly recommend and use them again.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Our home was due for a new HVAC system this year, and I worked with Guy to put together a system that was perfect for our home. Guy had wonderful communication and attention to detail, and answered all my of my questions, and taught me plenty more. He's the kind of guy who really understands his trade, and I never felt like I was working with a 'salesman'. I was able to speak with Dan (the owner of Advanced) and he also understands customer service and treated us like gold. After looking at several options (as every home and family has different needs) we installed two new furnaces, coils, and condensing units, and we were educated on options that married quality, longevity, warranty, and price which ultimately led to making an easy decision.  Install was efficient, and after an extra day of fine tuning, our systems are keeping us comfortable in our home and working extremely well. Thank you to the team at Advanced Plumbing, Heating, and Air. We will continue to work with you into the future!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Advanced Plumbing sent a professional team that identified a situation that needed to be repaired. As I was leaving town for a while I was concerned about how soon they could respond. They returned the next morning and fixed the issue. A couple of good guys I would call for again, Cesar and Chris.<//Review></record>

<review>We were having trouble keeping cold water on our 6-year old tankless water heater. They were able to help troubleshoot possible problems and flush the system. They determined our pressure regulator wasn't calibrated when the house was built! Between that and the flushing (the previous owners hadn't flushed it in the 6 years they had it) everything is working great.

We originally were scared that we'd have to pay for a whole new fancy tankless system and the labor for install but it turned out this was enough. I greatly appreciate the time they took to help me!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>The service technician was extremely polite and extremely efficient at diagnosing our problem. Following the identification of the problem we were presented with two solutions, with clear cost estimates for each. The technician provided clear advantages and disadvantages of each solution that allowed me to feel very confident with the option I choose. We will definitely call Advanced Plumbing Heating and Air for any future plumbing or HVAC issue we have.<//Review>< pics>

So far, so good. We are extremely please with the professionalism of Jeff at advanced. We are looking forward to our remodel.
We will come back after it’s done and share pics.

I'm back, It's been about a year and we ended not only getting our main bathroom remodeled but also adding a half bath.  These guys know their stuff.  Do not hesitate to hire this company.  Our bathrooms look amazing and were so beautiful, when we sold our home the value of our home skyrocketed.  We are still floored.  Thanks Jeff!!!  You Rock!!< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Wonderful experience! Professional, friendly, prompt service. Chris went above and beyond for us in our new home. Ran new line for our gas range, our refrigerator, and finished our shower the previous owner didn't. Chris was here all day and he is a great tech. We even found other issues we were unaware of and he fixed those issues as well. We have found our forever plumbing company. Read the reviews like I did, use them and find out for yourself the reviews are true. Great company and techs!</text><Time>1597250247890< /Time>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I have used their services twice in the first year I owned my house. The first time was to replace a broken water main. They showed up super fast and replaced my water main without any problems. The second time that I used their service was because my sewer line backed up, again they showed up with a smile on their face, eager to help me get my home back in working order. Both times that needed to use their services, their technician Chris showed up. I CHALLENGE YOU to find a nicer guy! I am always so curious about the process and what it takes to complete a job and he is always happy to take the time to explain to me, as well as how the problems arise. Having a friendly, professional and frankly funny tech helping you out really puts your worries at ease when you are freaking out about your house problems.

I STRONGLY recommend Advanced Plumbing Heating & Air. I will be calling them for everything in the future, solely based on Great rates, Friendly Faces and "Get It Done" Attitude.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

In the middle of a pandemic and on the eve of evacuations because of a fire, my toilet, sink, and shower all decided to back up.  I called Advanced Plumbing Heating and Air for their help and they were amazing.  From the woman who answered the phone to the technician who came to my house, they were professional, explained all my options, and were efficient in their services.  I am so thankful for everything they did and will make sure they are my first call if I ever have another plumbing emergency.  Highly recommend them!<//text>

<review>I am truly and remarkably impressed with Advanced Plumbing Heating and Air. If I can give more than a 5 star rating, I’ll definitely give them a 10. After two weeks of delay and frustration with American Residential Warranty and the contractor they chose to resolve my water heater problem, I finally took matters into my own hands. The safety of my family is my biggest concern and this is something that my home warranty company seemed to have ignored. So I called Advanced Plumbing Heating and Air in Vacaville CA. Ashley picked up the phone and it was so nice to hear a very courteous and professional person on the other line. She told me that they can send a technician in the afternoon but then she called again stating they can come over much earlier.  Chris and Angel arrived earlier than expected and they were true to their motto “Solutions Not Excuses.” Chris told me exactly what I needed to know which made my decision much easier. He even offered me to check estimates from other potential companies but I was already very satisfied with their service at that point. Within an hour Chris and Angel returned with all the items and tools they needed. Their teamwork was impressive to watch and Chris explained what they were doing and why. Although they still had two other customers to go to, Chris and Angel took their time to make sure everything was done right. They triple checked their work until they were satisfied and even taught me how to operate my new water heater. I wish all companies are like Advanced Plumbing Heating and Air who are true to their promise and professionalism. They made everything so easy and I actually could not believe it can be this simple. I highly recommend this company and will be calling them again for all my future plumbing, heating and air needs. Thank you Chris, Angel and Ashley! I have faith in humanity again.< /review><rate>5</rate><Pics>None<//Pics><Date>1591220066458< /Date><Gmap_id>0x80853ce8a7b74d4f:0x4e19fe7e48396cf8<//Gmap_id>< Name>

The tech also found a few other issues including my house pressure regulator having failed and delivering a potential catastrophic line pressure to my house. Great work, and the tech who took care of us (Cal) on top of it all is a Loadmaster on the C-5 Galaxy in the United States Air Force in his "spare time."

<text>The receptionist said they would be at my house in 20 minutes and they showed up in 15. I showed them where the problem was and they went to it. The plugged drain was being difficult so they bought in the big snake on wheels. They carried it in to avoid soiling the runner and they got the job done at a fair price. I highly recommend them.< /text>< gmap_id>

< review>
Our water line broke between the city service and our house.  Our home builder used cheap plastic piping instead of copper or other strong metal.  Cal (who is great) was able to replace the entire line in one day without tearing up our front yard.  The only reason that I gave four stars instead of five is that the charge was very expensive.  We only had one choice if we  wanted a warranty for the work: that was to replace the entire line, instead of a repair where there would not be a warranty. I believe any work should have a warranty and not be pressured to pay a very expensive bill just to get a warranty.  We are talking $4800 compared to $480 and we are retired and on a fixed budget and that really hurt.

I am updating my comments above.  I was contacted by the owner of Advanced Plumbing, Dan, and we had a clarifying discussion regarding the warranty of work done by Advanced Plumbing.  I found out that any work done by Advanced does come with a warranty and that the mis-communication that we had will be cleared up.  Dan was kind enough to work with us and was able to meet our satisfaction 100%.  I will still recommend Advanced Plumbing to my neighbors as they did an excellent job.  I appreciate Dan contacting us and clearing up any misunderstandings that we had.  I appreciate him working with us.< /review>

Advanced Plumbing provided excellent, fast service. Their quality of work was superior and Cesar was very pleasant and efficient with his crew. They had several itmes to work on - replacing a shower valve, replacing the water main and irrigation shutoff valves, and replacing the water heater. Cesar took care of the city of Davis permit and arranged the final inspection hassle free. I would recommend them without hesitation for plumbing work, and will use them in the future for any necessary work.</review>

We are new to the area and didn’t know who to call.  You had good reviews so we gave you a call.  It all started with Ashley when we called to inquire about replacing a water heater. She was courteous and professional. Based on her we scheduled an appointment for an estimate. Cal arrived at the agreed upon appointment time. He too was very professional and gave us the estimate to replace the existing water heater.  We accepted the estimate and Cal arranged for the work to begin within the hour.  The job was completed the same day.  Thank you for a wonderful plumbing experience. We will call you whenever more work is needed and recommend you when possible.<//review>

I would strongly recommend this company to anyone in need of sewer repair. The gentlemen who arrived  were friendly and very efficient in the repairs.

Professional installation of new hot water heater and all the now required safety bells and whistles, and oh yeah, coordinating the city permit and inspection now needed.  Work was done as promised, when promised. Advanced's price was about 10% lower than some other local plumbers I received quotes from -  although if you haven't used a plumber in awhile (like me) the costs will still be a bit surprising.</review>

<Review>My main water main broke. They were able to fix it at a far lower cost than the other bid I received. And they were able to schedule the work quickly. I’d use them again.< /Review>< user>

We added a booster pump to our house because of low city water pressure.  This was not an easy task.  Cal stayed with it and with us until it was done perfectly.  Very impressed with his professionalism, transparency and desire to be sure we got exactly what we had contracted for.  Definitely will use them again.< /Text>

I came home after work to find the supply line to one of the toilets had burst, flooding the house. I turned the water to the toilet off, but needed a plumber to confirm a burst and to fix the line to satisfy my insurance company. The plumbing company I had used in the past would not even schedule an appointment until all the water in the house was cleaned up. It was after 5 PM. Advanced was the only company that answered the phone. An appointment was scheduled for first thing in the morning. The toilet got fixed. The insurance company was satisfied, and I could start the claims process.<//Text>

The home and pest inspection reports on our newly purchased manufactured home in Vacaville showed numerous plumbing problems that needed addressing. Chris was amazing! He responded promptly and made himself available to answer all our questions. As the list of items in need of repair grew, he quickly and seemingly effortlessly took care of them. He even contacted another company on our behalf to make sense out of work a previous owner had done. The office personnel were friendly and competent. There is just nothing not to like about this company!< /review>

Advanced Plumbing was flawless for me.  I needed a closet flange installed (ring that holds toilet to floor), and from the 1st call to the work performed by Jeff, it was all great (including my having to reschedule), and was less than 24 hours from the time I initially called to when the job was complete.< /text>

<Text>I needed  same day help with a leak.  I had called another plumber on Monday and again on Tues. morning with no response  I called two other plumbing companies and was told the earliest I could have someone check out the leak was Wednesday.  Advanced was able to send someone out  during the day on Tuesday to check out my leak and determine that it could in fact, be taken care of on Tuesday.  Ceasar was professional and explained what was taking place along the way.  I would have him do future work for me any time< /Text></record>

<Text>I went to the office on Commerce and the person I spoke with was very courteous and efficient.  Made the appointment for the next morning at 9:30 and the tech, Cesar showed up on time and gave me an estimate.  We accepted the estimate and he left to get the water heater.  He was back in under 30 minutes and promptly had a new one installed and removed the old one.  All in all a good experience with no hassles or unexpected charges.</Text>< user>

Advanced Plumbing is the best. I've called them at least 4 times for different jobs and I have never been disappointed. The most recent was our backyard pump not working. For over a year I struggled to find someone that worked on pumps. I called them hoping to get a referance and they fixed it!!!
They are always professional, they explain....they are just AWESOME!< /Text>

<Time>1541367281740<//Time><Review>On late Friday afternoon, l noticed my toilet was leaking around the front base. I called Advanced Plumbing immediately, talked to John who dispatched Jeff.

Jeff responded in less than 2 hours on late Friday afternoon. He pulled the toilet, confirmed his diagnosis, and replaced it after we got new one!

Reasonable, Reliable, and Responsive!

<Name>Carol Wilcox< /Name><review>Once again I had the need to contact a plumber about a hot
water heater concern. I had wonderful service from
Advanced Plumbing for another issue about a year ago
when Dan came and fixed an outside water leak problem.
This morning Cal came to check my hot water heater, he
satisfied my concerns about the problem, said I didn't need
a new heater at this time and when I asked how much the
charge would be for his call, he said No Charge. What a
great feeling of relief this was. When the time comes for a
new hot water heater, I'll be calling Advanced Plumbing,

Our water main was blocked and we needed service as soon as possible. When I called at 10am I spoke with Tom who was very courteous and helpful. It was storming outside and they were booked up with appointments, but Tom said he'd reach out to Cesar to see if they could get us in. We ended up with an 11:30am appointment. Cesar showed up on the dot and cleared our water line in the pouring rain! Very reasonable price especially considering how quickly they were able to come out, not to mention the excellent customer service! Definitely will reccomend.</Text>

I called yesterday to see about getting someone out to look at a leak coming from one of the toilets in our house. The person I spoke to on the phone was friendly and managed to find someone to come out today (other places didn't have any openings for over a week) to give a free estimate; he was also understanding of my work schedule and was able to make accommodations so that I wouldn't have to take off from work. Jeff was my plumber today and he arrived within the timeframe that I was given (which is a HUGE plus for me) and was courteous, friendly, and professional. He worked diligently and provided clear and thorough explanations for everything that he needed to do, as well as everything that he did do. I don't have a single complaint to give!<//review>

Chris came out to look at my water heater. I was informed it was likely part of a big AO Smith recall and he took the time to look up the recall hotline so I could get the service done at AO's expense. The office staff who helped me set up the appointment (and answered my recall related questions later) were also great. Although they didn't end up servicing my heater, I would not hesitate to call them for other plumbing or heat & air services. A great experience overall!< /review>

Called them at 1 PM and my irrigation issue was fixed by 3 PM.  Paid less than half of what the other guy quoted since, as I suspected, no parts were needed.  Couldn't be happier...thanks!<//Text>

I called Advanced Plumbing late in the afternoon to fix a leaking irrigation valve. It wasn't an emergency but John said he thought he had a plumber becomming available. Cal showed up a short while later and quickly assessed the problem. An estimate was provided and he got right to work. He had to make a trip for some parts and replaced the faulty valve and reconfigured the pipes.  The repair worked perfectly and was promptly completed. I recommend you call Advanced Plumbing. John and Cal were professional and very helpful!<//text>

Advanced Plumbing and Rooting Services owned by Dan Fontaine gave excellent service on prior jobs. This last job Chris worked two days fixing my issues. Chris really outdid himself, and exceeded all my expectations. I believe Advance Plumbing to be the absolute best plumbing company in the Vacaville area bar none.  This is why:  Best Customer Service, Best Pricing, Fast Response, Honest, Fair, Responsible, and Pride in their work.  They are professional, know their trade, and preform excellent work, and they do it all!  They offer free estimates, and even free house inspections. If you want someone you can trust this is it
My Story.....I’ve lived in this area since 1975, I’ve have had several different plumbing challenges, and used various companies. Now I am retired on a very fixed income.  I knew the work I needed done was extensive, lots of leaks, toilet faucets etc., a RO system had to be installed, a line needed to be run under the house for refrigerator water, and the water heater had an over flow issue, This was discovered when it flooded into the garage.  Come to find out the overflow from the water heater should have been routed outside, and wasn’t even to code.
I phoned a few plumbing companies about my issues and obtained several quotes. The job was time sensitive.  Time and pricing were big issues, and I know nothing about plumbing, so I have to trust who ever to know their job and to be fair. I do know a lot about people from years working in public service myself.
These are good honest people with exceptional work values, and expertise. When I phone Advanced, Dan answered the phone himself, and right then and there made me feel confident that his company could handle everything. I had used them before and always very happy.

The response time was unbelievably fast. Chris came out for the initial quote. I knew immediately that I wanted him to do the job!  Advanced Plumbing also had the lowest quote, fastest response, and gave me a discount on top of that. Chris started the job ASAP.  Chris even called his boss to see if his schedule could be adjusted so he could continue working the next day to finish the job. Not only did Chris do an excellent job on the issues I phoned about; he also discovered two other items needing attention.  He was so honest, one issue was a leak at the washing machine connection (biggie, next week the floor was to be replaced), and Chris fixed this one replacing faucet and pipe.  The other item was a small dripping leak under the house he noticed, when he went under the house for the refrigerator line, this leak was coming from the shower area.  This was from a pipe connection that is no longer allowed in plumbing.  Instead of making me feel like I had to take care of this immediately, he stated that at some point I might want to consider fixing it, because the pipe could burst causing bigger issues. Meantime he said I might want to avoid the shower, and use the bath in the other room. I loved his practical common sense approach.  He went on to say that his company offers free entire home pipping checks, including gas lines. I didn’t realize they gave free whole house checks. Look up their website; they are quite diversified in their abilities. They are certainly worth the call.<//review>

The manager,Kimberly helped me out. She was patient and friendly. She was very busy but didn't show it. She was very efficient and thorough. She went above and beyond to make sure I knew what services my car needed. I drive  a Subaru and they don't offer all the services they normally do for Subarus but she still helped out with some good advice. The staff on duty was efficient and very professional! Car drove better immediately. I am so glad I took my car there today! Thank you Kimberly and your crew today!< /Review>

Added 4/25/2021 - I'd suggest you have the Regional Manger Contact me directly......Terrible Quality of Service. On their form after completing service, a box was checked the stated SEALED relating to the Chassis Lube. Well it isn;t hard to see the Zirc's on the BallJoints and the Cross-Link and the Idler Arm. The truck is lifted to you can see the Zirc's on the CrossLink from 20 feet away.  Terrible, terrible, terrible.....< /review>

Took my car into Jiffy Lube in Galt CA., at 8:00 AM this morning. They were open and I was second in line for service. The service was done in less than 45 minutes, and I was on my was back home.
They are very professional, friendly and did a through and competent service. Emailed me my receipt and went through their policies so I could understand what was included with my service.
Very nice staff,  and for sure I will use them again.
Thank you Jiffy Lube.</Text>

I had an incredible experience when it came to the service and friendliness of the working crew! I was helped specifically by Clarence and he took wonderful care of me as a customer. He was an excellent example of what customer service should look like and it was an overall great experience. I would definitely have my oil changed here again!</review>

Went to jiffy lube for oil change and told them I might have a leak if they could find it. They said they couldn't see anything. Went home puddle under my car with oil. Went back and they said it could be power steering fluid which it isn't felt like Ive been ripped off<//Text>

That being said it is pricey for an oil change ($68 for a basic oil change, $99 for synthetic oil, additional $25 for a tire rotation!) I loved the fantastic service but it's a bit cost prohibitive for me for getting an oil change every 3 months.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I was pleasantly surprised with Jiffy Lube, I have to admit that I didn't trust Jiffy Lube! After today's experience I am 100% satisfied with the initial salesman (Clarence) he was very respectable and courteous. The service that Jiffy Lube provided me for my Benz was outstanding, I can't believe what I received! I will definitely recommend Jiffy Lube to everyone I know! Special shout out to Carlos for the service to my car! Who takes a Benz to Jiffy Lube, I do! Thanks!<//text>

Needs to be more professional. The staff are nice, but they tell you your wait time will be 30 minutes and it will end up being over an hour. They’ll try to sell you extra things even if you bought those extra things at your last visit.

The employee who was serving customers this week was sick with a runny nose and sneezing. That’s unacceptable. And guess what? 2 days later I got sick! He touched my steering wheel so that’s no doubt how I got it. I don’t think I’ll come back here for this very reason. The manager should send anyone home who is symptomatic of a virus.< /Text>

I’ve had my oil changed at this jiffy lube in Galt two times in 7 years and both times my gravel shield fell off a day or two later commuting to work. I’m not sure what’s so difficult, but for what this place charges you’d think they would be able to tighten down some bolts.
Never again will I bring my vehicle to a Jiffy Lube again.<//review>

<Text>Quick service, efficient staff. LAWRENCE was very helpful.
Will return.
Edit: A few months later, I returned for my second oil change. 1.5 hour wait time. There were two customers in front of me that were already having their respective vehicles worked on. I only came in for an oil and filter change. After the service, I headed home for a few hours. As I was leaving home, I noticed some oil drips under my vehicle. Turns out, the technician  / mechanic, didn't bother cleaning the residual oil off of the frame rail after the filter change. It still looked like a river of oil across the front of the frame. I went back and offered "positive" feedback to the manager offering solutions to have customers return. I really don't think he cared. Just gave me what sounded like a pre-formatted apology. Most likely will not return.</Text><name>C Renaissanceman<//name>< Pics>

If I could give a minus I would. !!! I went in for a basic oil change. The manager Lawrence E. came to me and said that the dip stick broke, he was holding the part, he said that "this is very common with this make of vehicle" I said "Really?" i've had this make of vehicle for 15 years. hmm. he said that they will replace for free, i would hope so...he said that he would have to order part if not in stock will order I asked "from dealer?" He said "Yes" . should be later that day or next day.  Next day.. no call.. I called late am. He was at lunch.I left message.I never did rec a call from Manager LAWRENCE e.   I then called 2 dealers asked how common? both said not very, I asked if they had part in stock yes..2.  My husband then stopped in Lawrence proceeded to tell him that the item was on back order that would not be in for 3 days.  cought him in lie #2. informed him that we called dealership and that they had 2 on the shelf, We insisted that they go and get it and install by 4 pm that day.  When we arrived, Manager Lawrence E was not there. hmmm.  I would not suggest going to this location... the manager lies.</Text>

They dont have very good customer service, when I refused service that they said I needed bad, they got really rude. I didn't have any leaks until I got my car serviced here. They also got oil prints from their work gloves on my gray interior.< /review>

My dad has been raving about a gentleman named Brandon here. He has mentioned his great customer service like six times lol. He’s not great with technology so I figured I’d hop on here and share his opinion. He said Brandon is a great person that was extremely helpful and kind.< /Review>

<review>They are always helpful and a pleasure to work with. I have many commercial pools that I have to take samples for water testing and they are always so kind. I recently took a sweep to be evaluated "the pool cleaner" and they just found a pebble was stuck and didn't even charge me. I appreciate their promptness in the sweep check. Brandon and his crew are very awesome staff. Thanks for all you do< /review>< Date>

My boyfriend and I delt with two employees here and both were so very helpful. One guy even started sharing home remedies for clearing my sinuses because he could tell I wasn't feeling very well. They worked hard with us to find what we needed even when they didn't have it in store.</Review>

I just went to your store to pick up chlorine tablets for my pool. when I walked in there were 3 people in front of me.I stood in line and the 3 people were waited on and when it was my turn the girl at the desk totally ignored me and waited on another customer that had just walked in the door and was just buying a brush. I was looking to buy the chlorine at 84 dollars. I waited approx. 24 minutes and was never acknowledged or told - we will be with you in a minute To the owner you don't know how your employees are conducting themselves. If it was up to me I would fire them and not loose money. I went to lowes and they got 84 dollars< /text>

We are in the process of considering a reverse mortgage. Our counselor was very patient, very informative and our fee was waived due to an ongoing grant. That was a very nice surprise.< /review>

I am so happy that I had my counseling session with Credit.org. They were professional, knowledgeable and gave me all of the attention that I needed.
I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs counseling services.< /Text>

However, during the session several concepts about what happens after I pass on were clarified. Now I feel very confident in explaining the reverse mortgage to my children.< /text>< Pictures>

WARNING!
From personal experience, this place is scam and you will end up paying for it. PLEASE do your research and find a reputable credit counseling, there are so many honest trust worthy companies out there that won't lie and cheat you out of your money.< /review>

<review>My counselor was easy to listen to and ask questions of.  She didn't mind going back in our conversation to clarify some things for me.  I understand a few things much better for having had the opportunity to review the reverse mortgage process with her.  She made some great suggestions as well.
Thank you !< /review>< Pics>

<Review>CCCS was able to put me on a payment plan and it was a major relief to our finances. My counselor was very understanding not judgmental at all.  When I was contacted by CCCS the representative who spoke with me first also was extremely welcoming and patient. I highly recommended CCCS for their services. It’s time to breath again.  Thank You for all of your assistance!</Review>< pictures>

<text>Great company to work with. Took their CalHFA class, and learned a lot about the process. We downloaded the worksheets (we pretty much created similar docs on our own) to use as a reference in the future to keep us on track.
The coach was great. Gave us a breakdown of what we were doing and what we needed to work on.< /text>< pictures>

If your credit score isn't at it VERY BEST, this is THE place to go.
They'll explain everything. They seem to know everything you could need.

I called for information regarding a debt management/settlement program, but after being counseled I learned it was not necessary.  My debt issues are not as overwhelming as I perceived, and with some budgeting, I can do it myself!  I cannot tell you how inspired the credit counselor left me (I believe her name was Eleanor).<//Text>

I am very pleased that I spoke with Byron Whetzel and he handled my problem. He's very knowledgeable and he explained the program to me so that I understand how it works. I just started the program, but I am already relieved to know there is a light at the end of this tunnel.</review>

If you are knowledgeable at all about budgeting and what goes into buying a home this course is not for you. Also, it’s too expensive for how simple the online course is. Takes a long time too. They don’t inform you how long the test is or how long it will take. Took us a long time to get through it because we had to do it during the week after work and getting the kids to bed. We were exhausted by that time so we could only stay awake for parts at a time. Very boring reading when you have already gone through most of the process.<//text>

Your property is just stolen by a corrupt institution and they supposedly want to "help" you but they record everything to give it to the bank or financial institution that just stole your property...and then tell you to go to other awful govt. agencies for more so called "help"!! They just set you up to get info so they pass it on...wow...how deep down this rabbit hole do we go? Stay away.
My suspensions are now confirmed...
Got an email from HUD asking where I was and how to reach me, this non-profit is an "inside" agency designed to assist in the theft of real estate from American citizens and then transfer the assets to "buddy investment groups" so banks have an arm
Length transaction on the theft of property.
This is serious....very diabolical.<//Review>< Response>

Go somewhere else!  They have no idea of time keeping or appointment keeping.  If you must deal with these people and make a appointment, better plan on spending the whole day waiting.   Complete waste of time and since they never made their appointment I will have to waste another day trying to finish what I already started. My hands are tied but yours aren't. Avoid if possible< /Review>

<Review>Prior Employee 2013 - In the time I worked for this company I unfortunately walked away disappointed. I have over 25 years experience in the mortgage industry and I do not have one unkind word for any of my prior employers. In those years I received numerous service excellence awards, cards and letters of appreciation for the job I do as a professional. At Springboard, I learned that none of this mattered, there is a strong alliance between the Latino/Hispanic staff. And what I saw was a jealousy or what is better described as fear of an individuals personal growth within the company. I found myself definitely questioning their ethics and integrity here. The employee atmosphere is tense, stressful and unprofessional to say the least. The quality of service depends on the mood of management . They run this organization like a sweat shop/slave driven workshop, "numbers over quality." Absolutely no respect for employees. I would highly recommend going somewhere else for assistance as they do train new employees for 2 weeks only to place them on a floor of supervisors or "team leads" with no respect for managerial authority. Simple case of "Too many Chiefs, not enough Indians." Each Team Lead has his or her rules, and they want you to follow them and not management, which is confusing for a new person. Follow at your own risk, in my experience this type of managerial floor breeds back biting and dishonesty which will yield failure in the end. Overall, the training was great but was not reflected in service. Personally, I thought after attending training needed to be shortened and revamped according to employee or customer feedback. The counseling calls are way too long for what a client receives, which is a recommendation. Homeowners can gain this information surfing the web or from calling your lender. Just call your bank and speak to your Loss Mitigation Department. One way Springboard makes their money is being paid by (HPF) Homeowner Preservation Foundation by way of your lender approximately $150.00 a session. Hope this helps you make your decision.< /Review>< Resp>
