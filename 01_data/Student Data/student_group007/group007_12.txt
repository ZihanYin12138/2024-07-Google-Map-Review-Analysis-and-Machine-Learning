Checked in for my 9 am appointment at 7 :15 am & after security guard took our info & told me to come to the table next to the guard shack with paperwork & after 10 mins, she provided me with a door number. They started unloading us right away & got done within 2 hours. Very friendly staff & clean facility. Docking area is big enough to back it up your trailer to a dock comfortably.</Text>

Fast unloading but, took too to long to even start unloading. Took 2 hours before they started to unload me. Unloaded me in an hour but total was 3 hours. What a waste and I came an hour early and in LA that’ll make all the difference if your stuck in traffic for hours .<//Text>

I got lucky today.  My 1st time here and I was worried having read many of the bad comments.  Fortunately, my experience was all positive.  I arrived almost 1 hour late due to traffic accidents and they still let me deliver.  The guys in security office (Felipe and Scott) are very nice and positive!  There is plenty of room to back and easy in and out gates.  It wasn’t real busy and I was empty in less than one hour!  I know this isn’t typical, but this can happen.  Hope you truckers have same type of experience.
Sorry if you get stuck waiting 5-6 hours or more!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Employees are friendly, except one receiving man who refused to speak, and would just point at things, and suddenly over the phone he was speaking without issues, weird dude,
One suggestion though, when asking for id and pprwork at entrance, dont take the id to the back, just write info there, COVID doeant transmit thru paper, but it does thru other objects such as a license or wallet, its for driver and employee safety, otherwise, great place.<//review>

They can have you out in 45 minutes or they can take as long as 6 hours that’s been my experience for the most part they’ll get you out within two hours but if you see a lot of trucks on the docks be prepared to wait. They have about 30 docks they use to live unload and if you about 20-25 trucks already docked just expect to wait quite a while. The process is fairly simple, it’s one truck at a time, make sure you have your reflective vest on at all times, guard will assign a door you park the truck at said door and then turn in your paper work at the office. Go back to your truck and once the light is green you are good to go. If your freight is not pre paid you will have to wait for lumper to call you and give you a total for unloading freight. So very simple process and easy in and out it’s just the unloading process that can sometimes take forever, so hopefully you have better luck than not.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Truckers get there early because you will be waiting there a long time. If your appointment is at 12.00pm you need to be 45min early. Then you can spend up to 2 to 3hrs after docking to get unloaded.<//text>

Got here at 11 pm. They take early appointment,  friendly security and explained all the steps since its my first time. Getting in and out like an hour. Appointment was 7 am but they took my load 8 hours early before the appointment time. Amazing. No complaint.< /Text>

Your no idling policy sucks. Your warehouse has a/c, yard goats have a/c,  guard shack has a/c. But the hell w/truck drivers. Local law may dictate your rule, but a picnic table w/4 metal seats. Really. Show some respect.  Without us, there is no you!<//Text>

Security is rude and the lumpers are even ruder. Make you wait forever to get unloaded. Definitely less than one star. Dont matter if youre on time, you're gonna be stuck here a minimum of 5 hours up to 12 hours. One of THE WORST to deal with in the nation!< /text>

This is one of the many places that I don't like to come back again ever! Security guards are to lazy to go out and check for seal intact you got to bring it to them then they forced you to bring you own safety vest when is there own f****k rules and if you don't have one they refuse to take the load.<//Text>

<Date>1582441941426<//Date><Rate>2< /Rate><review>No matter what your contract said, they close food before the time, even when you paid for your bartender he close at 11pm when your party its until 12pm. Cake it's not fully served the amount it's so poor  they keep most of it and coffee it's served in  very small foam cups. So be prepared to take your own cooler  and prepaid food with warmers and coffee table for after 11 so, your guest can have something to drink, but the worst part it's security team they demostrated not education, bad manners they rude with guest, when you want to talk with owner he is not available until next day, personal discussed with guest before than you. And be awared they count not for amount of people you have paid they count for tables so, if you have a table wit 2 or 3 empty chairs and you got 1 more extra table even if you need 30 or 40 people more to complete your contract your going to be charged with 300 dls more  per table otherwise securities got your guest out with any advise to you not asking to you if you available to pay the extra, they count honor table as 12 people too that's crazy  And next day owner said his cameras show different things🙄 other wise very elegant  and nice place food excellent and elegant presented. It's a shame they don't respect schedule for food, bartender, and they treat you like they doing you a favor when that food its fully paided  just live it no matter if not waitter serving. yes maybe I'll will get it again if price it's not so expensive but taking my own cooler coffee machine otherwise taking my own decent coffee cups, and extra warm food containers from outside, and checking they follow contract rules. One more thing the photographer they provide it's not a compromise to get it, your party will look very poor if your getting money from your guest for pics. And the pic theyll give you for this too small don't get it. I feel bad because place its  really nice but owner need to listen people taking care of his bussiness< /review>< pictures>

So first all I would like to give a huge thank you to platinum banquet and their team. I am very happy how everything turned out.
So my sister's quinceanera was this last Saturday. They let us enter the hall at 10 am to prep everything that we needed to do. Like the candy bar the decorations and also the photographer was able to check the dvd player and we had no problems at all. My sister was also able to practice before the actuall dance so that was great.
I met the manger who in charge and he explained everything. Mind you my parents don't speak Spanish so I had to translate. But he explained that 10 mins before they open the buffet they would feed the quinceanera and the crew. Which was so fancy i actually loved it. And we talked about the timing of cutting the cake and the passing for the toast and ECT. He was so helpful. We didn't have plates for the candy bar and he was so nice to give us some. And when I had questions he was always nice about anwsering even if I asked twice. Also the security guard introduce himself and basically explained what his job indicated like the list and If there were to be a problem he would first come to me then if the problem wasn't resolved then he would take furher action. But there was no problems at all. So they were both very helpful and both very nice people. Also the servers were great. Every time I asked for something they would answer and just do what I would ask. Very nice people too. Very please with the management and their team all so helpful with great attitudes.
Now the food was okay. I personally liked it some dishes were good others were not. My family was not a fan. But I think as Latinos were not used to the type of food they provide But like I said they had many options some dishes were great others were not but the food was worth paying for less stress to worry about. Also what banquet halls provide great food. Lmk because I been to many and they all seem the same.  Also they provide chips with salsa, fruits as well. And now for the beer. I was so happy knowing we were able to bring as much as we wanted. And we were not charge for extra. We had the option of a open bar but we kept it simple so I am very please with that as well. Overall i was very happy with everything I would definitely recommend this hall to you and my friends to my family.  If you decided to book this hall please book in advance even a year in advance. We were planning for the summer but there were no more openings. We also thought no one would show up because of the timing but everyone showed up.
Also so y'all know the cost of the party. We had 300 guest. It included food, drinks, cake, fruit and the photographer which you had to pay for the pictures. But many people bought which was nice because they had a memory to take home. It didn't bother me at all. It was their hustle you have to respect that. But overall it was about 10 grand. But it is all different depending on the timing also how many guesy so just call and ask for an estimate. I also loved the fact that the owner was chill about the payments he allowed us to pay the the last payment a day before the party and he wasn't rude about it. And he was also very helpful and nice about everything. We will be booking the place in the future. And So once again thank you for everything. Less stress. Once it hits 12 am we picked up our last belongings. The banda was also picking up there things. No one rushed us.
I am so happy with everything!!!! Thank you again<//text>

<text>The worst service, I didn't like the food the person who serve the food in bad mood, we were supposed to have our table but when we get there someone else was sitting in our table and they dont care they sent us to sit with persons we have never met before far from our family,my husband and daughter in one table with other family and me and my 2 sons in other table, the place is kind of beautiful but you don't enjoy the time there because of the bad service.</text><Rate>1</Rate>< UserId.>

I have been coming here on and off since October 2020 and I absolutely love it. I look forward to coming here especially after a stressful day of work. This dance school is the best in the whole county .
David and his wife are absolutely lovely people and even though they have struggled to stay open through this past year, they are always very positive ,passionate, and are truly amazing at teaching all the steps .
They have a variety of classes which is great especially if you are brand new to Latin dances so you can try all the styles.
I would highly recommend giving this school a try . Environment is great and the group dances are so much fun ❤️
Thank you guys for putting together such a great school! It’s like therapy for so many of us !< /Review>< pictures>

I have been to many dance studios and dance venues throughout California. And I agree with many dance students, that this Dance studio is an impressive family of talented dance instructors. There is a solid core of dance core fundamentals that are emphasized with passion and dedication beyond the norm. This dance studio will have you dancing with full confidence in a relatively short amount of time. The husband and wife team and owners of this dance studio provide you with a tremendous amount of quality lessons. Their on going ingenuity and commitment to continuously redefine the lessons, provides you with the passion to attend each and everyday. I want to thank David and Jennifer Stein for all the encouragement throughout the Year 2019 and 2020 to challenge myself to progress to the very Best of my Ability. Your Dance Studio lives up to its name.....Majesty in Motion.
Sincerely,

Sergio Thomson

After finding Majesty in Motion, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a 4 pack to see if I would enjoy it, and I am so grateful I did!

They are extremely welcoming to everyone, fun/relatively easy to follow, and provided a comfortable environment for us to dance in. Everyone is so kind and allowed someone such as myself, who is nervous and stiff as a board, to be comfortable in my shoes. I look forward to taking more classes!

Took Hip Hop Fit with Mike... it was simply amazing. The instructor does not work off of 8 counts. He simply demonstrates the move and you follow. Simple enough. I haven't followed choreography in years but this was great. Recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and intense workout. O... and be ready for some serious pushups, planks and crunches.<//Review>

Out of an hour long class they frequently spend 40 minutes on solo work. During this time the only instruction is watching the instructor dance in the front of the room. If you do not get what the instructor is doing you will not be corrected or have an opportunity to ask a question. The music just keeps going and you just have to try again when the instructor repeats the movement.

Then they switch to partner work. The partner work instruction is adequate in quality, but the remaining 20 minutes is insufficient to fully grasp the partner sequence.

Ultimately there is very little correction if you are doing something wrong.

This is better than some studios, but no where near as good as a studio can be. They do not deserve the 1 star rating I’m giving them, but they also do not deserve the 5 star rating they have maintained. If their overall rating was 4 stars I think that would more accurately reflect the studio.

My suggestion for improvement would be to either place the solo work in a separate class or to reduce the amount of curriculum covered in a class so that it can be done properly.< /Text>

Never been to a Salsa or Bachata class before. Decided to take the beginners Salsa class they offered Monday evenings. The instructor David was the perfect mix of professional and fun to make the learning process smooth and enjoyable.
I'm coming back this Thurday to take take a second beginners class and start the Bachata one as well. Looking forward to learn more in the future.< /Text>

<text>Best Studio in San Diego! This studio has quality instructors & dedicated staff who genuinely want you to improve! They each have their own unique teaching style and adapt to each student. The studio itself is very clean and vibrant! The bright colored walls instantly put you in a good mood to dance!

They have class 7 days a week! So whether you want body movement, Salsa, or Bachata.. there is a way to fit your schedule. Not to mention the monthly rotating workshops! This is a great way to focus on details that may not be mentioned in a general class.

Keep an eye out for their Workshops with the Masters! Majesty brings in outside professional dancers so that their students have the opportunity to train with top level dancers! Overall a great studio with amazing people!<//text>< pics>

Michele is amazing and just a wonderful person.  We first went to Michele for our wedding dance lessons and then took swing and salsa lessons from her.  She makes learning dance steps/moves so easy and fun.  Working with Michele will not only improve your dance skills, but also boost your dance confidence as well.< /review>

<text>Wonderful studio and teachers. Took salsa many years ago at another studio and felt like I absorbed nothing, but I love the way the Majesty taught it and I feel like I've gotten so much more out of each class. Also tried Hip Hip Cardio and was super fun too. Parking lot is small for the small shopping center but not hard to find street parking nearby. Would definitely take classes here long-term if I wasn't moving to LA soon. Highly recommended!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I have been dancing with Majesty In Motion on and off for the last 10 years, and it has been a wonderful experience. David, Jennifer, Patrick and Eva are all excellent instructors with great personalities. No matter your dance level, you will be made to feel comfortable and supported. My dance abilities have improved greatly over the years, but I've also made some wonderful friends and had some great experiences. Majesty In Motion is like a big family, its a great company to grow as a dancer and make new friends!< /text>

David and his crew at Majesty in Motion are absolutely phenomenal!
My fiancé and I decided to try out salsa dancing on a whim last January and ended up at Tango Del Rey on a Friday evening. The first hour of the night was a class hosted by David and that was our first exposure to salsa. Needless to say, we had a great time and began taking classes at the studio soon after.

Since then, I have danced in Mexico, Peru, Boston, and NY and NONE of the classes I have taken can compare to our experience at Majesty in Motion. David and his instructors are not only great dancers themselves, but they are one with the dance. As instructors, they understand the physical and mental blocks of their students better than the students themselves and this is the defining characteristic of great teachers and the single most important quality that has allowed us to progress as well as we have with this dance company.

Joining the salsa team has positively impacted my life in ways I could have never imagined. Never having danced before in my entire life, it's an honor to be a part of a team comprised of such motivating, talented, and charismatic individuals.

To be honest, the thought of learning how to dance first terrified me. Letting the music move you is easier said than done.I was terrified that I would never be good enough. I didn’t know how to dance. I thought I would "fail". So I held on tighter, tensed up, got stiff.

David and Jennifer have taught me that the music’s always playing. We just have to decide if we’re still going to hold ourselves back, or if we’re going to dance. Try it yourself. Let go of those reigns. Give in. Surrender. Feel the music. Feel the rhythm. And then, when you’re ready, let it carry you. Let it move you.

We look forward to dancing around the world, but we'll always find ourselves back at Majesty!< /review>

<text>Majesty and Motion helps you build an excellent foundation in dancing Salsa with it's informal yet well structured classes. You'll learn more from private lessons but the group lessons will definitely help you practice and give you an experience to let you know whether or not you'd like to pursue more Salsa. I highly recommend the group classes for beginners and their social events are great as well, the entire crew is very down to earth as well as exceptional dancers, shout out to Dave and Patrick!</text>< UserId.>

< Review>
I started off with Majesty in Motion about a year ago. I didn't know how to salsa and didn't have a dance background. I started off with the group classes and picked up a lot. I have since joined one of the beginner teams and love it even more. All of the instructors are good. No partner required, rotating is encouraged because it makes everyone a better dancer. Sometimes the classes have way too many guys or ladies, but that's not the fault of the studio. It's just how schedules line up.< /Review>

In my opinion this dance company is amazing and very professional. I know many people who live far away and drive 2-4 times a week to take salsa classes with "Majesty in Motion". I love their teaching style. Thank you!</review>

<text>If you are interested in learning salsa or bachata, Majesty in Motion is the only studio that you need to know about. David and Jennifer are superb teachers who not only have the ability to break down any move so that anyone can understand it, classes are always lighthearted and fun as well. Classes are offered five days a week and if you are interested in taking your dancing to the next level, there are options to join numerous teams. All the great dancers who you meet at socials around the San Diego area currently train or have trained with Majesty in Motion. Do yourself a favor and check it out.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>If you have any interest in salsa, this is the place to go, whether you're a raw beginner, a progressing intermediate, or you're ready to jump into performance groups.  You can move at your own speed - if you want to stay in the basic class for several months you will still learn something new with each class; if you want to move up quickly they will support you in that too.  Awesome group of people.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Majesty in Motion is a prestigious dance company that I would highly recommend to anyone with the desire to learn and improve in salsa dancing. What sets MIM apart from other dance studios is the quality of the instruction offered. The instructors focus on the proper technique of the dance, which is the factor that ultimately takes dancers to the next level. The classes not only teach students basic moves and combinations, but also the importance that musicality and timing bring to the dance. The classes are always fun and create a welcoming and friendly environment for all. It has been great to be part of the amazing community that MIM has formed.< /review>

The best place to learn Salsa and Bachata!!!

I have danced for Majesty in Motion for the past two years and I have got to say, it has changed my life. I learned everything I know about Salsa and Bachata from David, Jennifer, Patrick, Robbie, Eva and Gonzalo. All the instructors I have encountered at Majesty have been so helpful and are wonderful human beings.

What I like about Majesty is that they focus a lot on technique, timing and body movement which are the keys to social dancing. I have looked into other dance studios in San Diego and this is hands down the best place to learn.

Majesty has become my family and they have made me feel so welcomed in the Salsa dancing community.</review>

I started taking classes with David Stein around November last year and was instantly hooked. I joined the company's dance team right away. He and Jennifer are fun teachers and so humble! I honestly love this company more than I can explain.. If you're in San Diego and want to learn salsa in a friendly environment Majesty In Motion (MIM) is definitely the place to go! Also, the company's newest addition, Sexy Bachata classes with Robbie!! & the Salsa kids team. MIM has got it all!< /Review>

Majesty in Motion is my favorite dance studio for Salsa and Bachata in San Diego!

The instructors are very knowledgable and pay close attention to the students so that everyone understands the choreography by the end of the dance class.

Furthermore, I live far from this studio but I make an effort to drive here simply because the quality of instruction you receive here is some of the best you are going to find in SD. And on top of that, the instruction isn't rigid and uptight but relaxed and fun.

I honestly recommend this company to everyone looking to dance salsa or bachata.</Text>

I just moved in last week. I just want to say “I love it”. Give 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ First of all, Dave, Jonathan, Danny. They made my move smoothly and quickly. Jonathan answered the email so quickly and professionally, Dave was so welcomed and kind, friendly, professional, also fixed my gate code within one min. Danny is very polite and friendly, precisely guided me on my tour. Everyone at Avalon Woodland Hills is absolutely amazing and wonderful!!! Also, building is so quiet and can sleep deeply. I feel at home, with a BEAUTIFUL VIEW! Security is very strong, the building is clean always. I love their strictness. I feel so safe. I received NEXT LEVEL SERVICE!!! And lots of palm trees and greens, great landscapes around the apartment. Also building is very special. I think a great architect designed this building. I see all patio is different size and shape, special exit stairs, etc. I can't find this kinda apartment building and room in LA. but there is nothing like AVALON WOODLAND HILLS. Also Ventura Blvd is eligible for “AT&T superfast fiber internet with low price. Everything is GREAT! I love living here, I am enjoying and grateful every day! Thanks so much, Avalon Woodland Hills! 😊❤️🎶🙏🏻</text>

I was a residence at Avalon Woodland Hills in Building 2  and I have to say that I was extremely impressed with the way the management team and maintenance team handle everything in a professional way. Their maintenance team was always there when we had a repair and they took their time to fine tune things until we were satisfied. Most importantly we had to be relocated to another Avalon property due to personal reasons and Yoda Banker could have not been more understanding of our situation. Yoda was not only professional but extremely kind to our request. This property is lucky to have him and we were very sad to leave this property because of finding people like this to work with is extremely rare. We thank you for everything and we wish you and your team the best of luck.<//Text>

We put in a maintenance request for a power outage upstairs. Pablo was quick to discover our issue , explained the cause, and fixed the problem. He had to get another part and even tested all the switches after replacing the problem outlet. Very happy with his service!</Review>

Hi Sidney

Please, if there’s a legally department, could I get their contact information to try resolving the issue friendly between us without the court & compensations for all things effected on my life after they an illegally kick me out and did not get me my money back despite I told the police that I’ve witnesses and all evidences that one’s of the workers at the leasing office was agreed with Hamoud to play this game upon me besides that there were two of witnesses when I gave Hamoud the cash for rent. Now I’m ready to get my right back if you’d like to meet me for looking on the appropriate solutions together or at the court as you like.

I’m looking forward to hearing from you ASAP.
Appreciate it.< /Review>

Worst experience ever... my neighbor building 4 in unit 207 been having issues with his living situation for the last few months. the A/C in his unit is broken and when he contacts the Maintenace team to repair the AC he gets told that my he issue is not essential. My neighbor is a disabled person and they are taking advantage of him. I hope he files a lawsuit against them because now there is a heat wave coming to our area and he might suffer and get sent to the hospital. I hope I never run In to the same issue as him. I am writing g this review to help him. Poor guy<//review>

It's like living at a vacation resort! Quiet, clean and safe. I enjoy this place so much I moved back after my travels. The staff is very professional, helpful and quick to respond to my needs. Daniel works in the office and has been quick to make sure my move in was smooth and effortless. After moving in I continue to run into Cecilio because he is always cleaning! And he is super friendly and helpful. Appreciate this place and it's staff very much! Glad to be home.< /Review>

<Review>The most awful place I've ever lived at. Please do not even consider living here for your own sake. Paid $24,000 of rent in a year just to be left with extremely poor communication by the staff, broken appliances, broken elevators, and broken washers/dryers that were all left that way for weeks at a time. The office staff is inexperienced and gives their residents different information that is unreliable. Even worse when you attempt to call the office with questions, you do not have the option of speaking with a representative, you are immediately sent to an automated voicemail and they DON'T return your calls if it's an inconvenience to their business. Absolutely terrible service. Save your money and time, run!!!</Review><Name>maria butean-salajean< /Name>< GmapID>

<Review>Awesome! Amazing! Home! We are about 9 days short of our first year here. It is difficult for any organization to maintain a hundred percent satisfaction for a full year. I've read some of the reviews from some of my fellow tenants that don't quite paint a picture of satisfaction. Everyone has different expectations and different experiences because we live in different units. So I don't want to say that the noise is not an issue for them. However, the residences at Pacific City receive a 100% satisfaction reading from me after a full year. I still feel as if I'm living at a resort full-time. The staff has had a few changes over the past year but there has been no let down in the quality of the service. Someone at</Review>< pics>

Omg. I am in building 4 there is a broken window in unit 207 that has been broken since November of 2019 and until today the apartment maintenance team are refusing to fix it. I’ve spoke to the gentleman that lives there and he advised me that he has been facing issues with the maintenance and management team for the last 7-10 months. They are refusing to fix any problem in his unit including the AC. Today is 08/15/2020 and we have a massive heat wave coming and this man is living with None working AC.

If it wasn't for Jonathan 's enthusiasm & confidence,  in Avalon Woodland Hills,  we would have not chosen Avalon Bay. He called to set up a viewing of the property with assurance that this was what we would definitely enjoy calling our new home. When we first came to view property, we had other homes to look @ , but after Johnathan's remarkable tour and knowledge we chose to look no further! He is a dynamic leasing agent hands down. He is extremely professional,  friendly and made our move in smooth as possible!! Anytime we've needed his help he was attentive and took care of our needs in a timely matter. Kudos to Jonathan!!!

<pictures>None</pictures><review>Didn’t even live there a measly year ,

And get this , I left this place immaculate . Replaced all light bulbs , painted the walls , hired carpet cleaners , cleaned all of the base boards , washed the windows , I left that place ready for move in  and yet they charged me $750 to replace the carpets and $115 for a cleaning like we lift that place filthy ????? I spent a whole week off of work to make sure it was pristine . I am livid !!!!!!!!!!!

I asked for a preliminary inspection that no one could respond or follow up on . IT IS MY RIGHT , they said they would leave a notice once preliminary inspection was done but was NEVER done .  I had to move out quick die to my husband having military orders elsewhere . I feel like they took advantage of my deposit .

Beware when you move out,  they will rip you off .</review>< Rate>

Broken AC
Broken Window
Broken garbage disposal
Broken dishwasher
Shame on you Avalon

Many Neighbors are trying to help him</review>

<Review>My daughter and her friend lived in one of the apartments for a little less than a year. They paid for the clean sweep service in case they did not get a chance to clean everything to the correct standard, plus it included carpet cleaning. We just received an invoice stating that they are being charged for replacing the carpet so they kept their cleaning deposit AND are charging them an additional $472. This is a complete rip off. When they moved in the carpet was clean but old. They were hardly ever at the apartment so I find it very hard to believe they did so much damage that it needs replacing. After reading the reviews I see that they were not the only ones charged to have the carpets replaced. It's a scam. BEWARE!<//Review>< Rating>

I am writing this to assist my neighbor in building 4 unit 207.
Broken AC since 12/2019
Broken window since 11/2018
Broken dishwasher since 2/2020
Broken garbage disposal since 4/2020
The manager is refusing to fix any of them and claim that those are not essential.
My poor neighbor. This is disgusting and a disgrace to Avalon communities around the nation</text>

<review>I just want to express my gratitude to the maintenance team of Avalon, and once again they did a great job. Each time we have an issue they are there to help if not the same day, it is the day after. This time it was Juan who was really brilliant to stop the alarm in the stairways which was going for days and we thought it was a parrot with hysteria at first. Then a leak in our car park...Each time we know we can count on their support and skill to get the job done and fixed. Thank you all and happy holidays</review>< Response>

It’s been less than two weeks and I’m already looking for a new place by the time the lease is up. I ignored the bad reviews on yelp because I figured most places have bad reviews and it’s usually not that bad. It’s really that bad. The process to move in was the only good experience. The tour was great, My husband and I were approved less than 24 hours later. Move in day is when it went downhill. The apartment wasn’t ready during the orientation. Broken doors. Missing doors. Broken blinds. Everything is beyond cheap and you can tell by the layers of chipped paint people move in and out rapidly. My first apartment I stayed in was for 3 years. My second apartment I was there for 7 years. So I was truly looking for a long term stay but I can’t imagine staying here. We still have a missing door that’s been completely ignored by staff. I even called Avalon headquarters and nothing- maintenance has told me twice they’d come measure and order a door yet have never showed up to measure. Our heater was broken for the first week of living here and it was freezing cold 50 degrees for a week before having the HVAC replaced. Every time you open or close the blinds at least one falls off and or the stick breaks off. One of the ignitors on our stove is broken and the first time I used it - it broke off and filled the whole apartment with gas, fire department had to come. It’s been a miserable week and a half. Many of the men in the building are so uncomfortable I can’t even walk my dog to the dog area without men within building grounds driving slowly yelling out the window. I have never experienced any thing like this ever. I’m super disappointed.<//text>

Athenna is a great person to deal with. I recommend if you have any issues go straight to her she is very open minded and her willingness is great. I have had many complications at this property to the point where I wanted to break my lease but she is the reason I renewed my lease because her customer service and personality. She should be in management she deserves it. They need more people with great customer service and a good attitude. I see why she sits in the front. She isn’t stuck up. She’s a very genuine  and a hardworking woman. And she’s very pretty!

To add on

Thank you to Avalon Woodland Hills staff and maintenance especially Ashley Cummings the maintenance supervisor. She heard what I was concerned with , listened and took care of everything that I mentioned to her. Her willingness to help after many times of me coming to the office. She was able to make things happen in a fast and timely manner and went over and beyond . Thank you Ashley for all your help and listening to me and making things better! I am now happy with my apartment . Great customer service by her .<//review>

Think more carefully when you want to move in because things changed a lot when you move out!!! Once I was so satisfied with what I can get here a year ago. But now they are charging me thousands of dollars when I move out and that's after days of cleaning!!!! Cockroaches exist when we move in and they hide behind the refrigerator. There is no way to tell they exist when I move in!! Or maybe you need to inspect everywhere. But they are charging $300 for pest control!!! That's crazy. Not mentioning $800 for carpet replacement as there is stain in the carpet. When I dispute the charges, they said these all stated in your lease! So you need to read every words carefully on the lease! Because they will steal your money based on these words! DO NOT CHOOSE AVALON!</text>

I would like to recommend Daniel Morales, Community Consultant at Avalon Woodland Hills, for his excellent customer service.  Daniel is friendly greeting customers with smiles.  He is attentive to the requests of the residents and is helpful when they have questions.  I wish there are more leasing consultants like Daniel in this Avalon office.  Ask for Daniel if you are interesting in this property.  He is the best.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>My wife was resident of this apartment about four years and she never seen this problem before. Long story short, the apartment management decided to towing cars from visitors parking without any warnings. I don’t want to tell park tenants cars in that spot is ok, but it becomes norms after many years for all residents or their guests to park cars there peacefully. However, I changed my plan to stay here longer and I never renew my lease. The only thing I got here is they don’t care about their rates and reviews. So, better be think about it before moving here, you never going to get the value which you paid for it😢<//Review>< pictures>

Honestly it's a great place and I've loved every moment living there. There are no car break ins, nor poop on the grass. Sometimes, barely ever there is a marijuana smell but it's still fine. Everyone is super nice and it's always quiet. 10/10 would recommend, it's awesome.< /review>

I purchased the move-out cleaning service and now I'm being charged $1000 because of pet hair. Avalon of Woodland Hills took pictures of the carpet with pet hair on it, and they decided to rip up the carpet and replace. I ask you, HOW DOES THE CLEANING FEE NOT ENCOMPASS BASIC VACUUMING? Corporate employees have straight up told me 'It is what it is...' Now THAT'S great customer service. Oh, and they wouldn't let us speak to a manager. SERIOUSLY?! I cannot believe this at all. We paid for cleaning because the leasing office PUSHED it on us. The leasing employee upon walkthrough said there was NO VISIBLE DAMAGE (and he referred to our carpets as well). I could have easily vacuumed the apartment. The rugs were not damaged, they had hair on them. This is ridiculous and an abuse of power. Other than this complete cr*p -- I've seen two dead rats in the middle of our community, and one very much live one. We've had someone sh*t on the the stairs leading up to the gated complex twice (which isn't gated very well because the doors are always busted). And we've had a junkie spend the night right outside our (again "gated") apartment. A stone's throw away from our sleeping baby. BUYER BEWARE.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Juan Franco on the Maintenance Team has been amazing! He has serviced my unit on several occasions from plumbing, air-conditioning, etc to being an advocate for us when it came to upgrading my floors to hardwood.  He has a wealth of experience that includes electro-mechanical which deemed to come in handy when servicing my refrigerator recently. Juan is always very prompt with mitigating issues with the interior and exterior of the apartment. He is also great with follow-ups if for some reason a part needs to be ordered and the work cant be completed same day.  Juan has provided a high level of service and I appreciate his calm and cheerful demeanor even in my most irate moments.< /Review>

I moved in to this community two months ago and so far everything is great. The leasing office is always there to help when I need them. Specially Athenna and Daniel, these have so much positive energy! Today they help with calling clarifying lots of questions that I had regarding my bills and mail services.

I would recommend this place to anyone!</Review>

So I had to go the leasing office 3 times in one day (don’t go at 9:30 am when the official is officially open, because there will be a sign that says it’s closed, or at least in my experience).

I’ve lived in the complex since June 2018 and my car has been egged multiple times. The first time I reported it I received a $50 credit to my account and an apology. The last time, last week I was again presented with an apology and a notice that they’re going to review the camera footage. I haven’t heard anything back so I decided to email the manager as well as write reviews so people know just how this overpriced “luxury” safe complex really is and if I can reach the headquarters I’m going to ensure they know as well. This is utterly rediculous for a place charging almost $3K a month. The access gate may as well not even be there because people sit, wait, and follow someone into the grounds. There’s no accountability at all unless you wish to break your lease because of what clearly has the potential to be a hate crime. No one should be required to stay somewhere they don’t feel safe and especially if no one does anything about it. I’m afraid for my safety, on the bottom floor where people walk past my bedroom and guest room windows. I double check the stairway before walking up and I’m constantly on guard. I’ve had to train my dogs to use pads to relieve themselves for fear of walking around in the dark alone. I’m used to businesses taking care of patrons and attempting to correct issues and this has not happened with my experience here. If I could leave a negative star rating I would because I can’t wait until my jailtime here is OVER!!!< /review>< pics>

<Review>Totally a disaster when you want to leave. So many charges. Hundreds dollars for pest control, and another hundreds dollars for cleaning, even though you have cleaned the apartment again and again and again before you leave. They can always find a way to charge you no matter what you did. DO NOT CHOOSE AVALON! NEVER!!!!!!</Review><user>111849042044893132849< /user>< Rate>

Most of the staff is completely unaware of what their responsibilities are. I've had one positive interaction with a staff member, and even that one didn't appropriately handle concerns. Building smells like pot, no one cleans up after their animals and management is about as poor as I have ever encountered.
Current manager is somewhat responsible. The rest of the staff that I have encountered I would absolutely let go of immediately.<//Review>

I was next pulled out of my apartment and almost stabbed in the neck. Avalon did nothing although I made a police report and I took the knife in. The police established assault with a deadly weapon. They people lived and or still live upstairs nothing happened to them at all.
Michelle a so called manager cornered me when I was leaving with her associate and were very rude and forceful with me and I was attacked. On top of that there were 6 witnesses.
To top it off my car was stolen from my parking space 5 weeks ago by a gang member.
I do not recommend living here. The hallways smell like pee and this is supposed to be non-smoking I smell cigarettes daily and cigarette butts all over. The management here is the worst I have encountered.

Yes I am moving. Do not recommend.</review>< Pics>

Good place to live short term, apartments are nice and quite, but very expensive. Security men are asshats, parking is assigned but tandem, elevators always breaking down, and because there are so many people the gate is absolutely ineffective. They need a person at the gate.< /review>

I am primarily disappointed with the safety in this community. Car Break-ins are frequent. The management just says "very sorry about this" and does nothing much to improve the situation. Rents are so high and apparently security is "courtesy patrol" I want to live in a secure space especially when im paying so much every month. Security is quite sluggish. I see suspicious people walking /cars driving around the community without any check.< /text>

Avalon has everything I needed in an apartment. Well maintained and excellent response rate to any concern. Good neighbors, close to everything, great amenities, etc. The on site staff are smart and friendly and helpful. The courtesy patrol is a must.</Review>

I am primarily disappointed with the safety in this community. Car Break-ins are frequent. The management just says "very sorry about this" and does nothing much to improve the situation. Rents are so high and apparently security is "courtesy patrol" I want to live in a secure space especially when im paying so much every month. Security is quite sluggish. I see suspicious people walking /cars driving around the community without any check.< /text>

For the 1st 2 years of my stay I was pretty happy with how things were going I will say maintenance is on top of getting things fixed when requested the amenities in the building are awesome but ther are definitely some downsides to living here 1st I will discuss how management does little to make sure residents are happy my personal storage in the building was broken into last year and it took them four days to change the Broken lock to my storage Because I didn't have a police report yet never were they apologetic or caring that $1500 worth the bikes were stolen from my storage I let that go...recently after living here for 3 years and requesting a parking space in my own building from day one and was told there was no available spaces and no waiting list I watched 3 people in my hallway including someone I referred to the apartment get spaces in my building And after explaining to them the safety concerns of having to cross a major driveway with no stop signs with my 3 kids and almost being hit on numerous occasion they inform me that there were 2 spaces available and that they would submit it for approval and I could use the spaced until approved after 3 weeks I was told that I wasn't approved Because I received a discounted rate when I moved in and saved $30 after explaining to them that actually the $30 I saved the 1st year They added to my remt increase the 2nd year making my rent increase a $150 the 2nd year I moved and a $120 each  Following year They then told me that it was out of their hands.... after contacting Avalon Bay customer service I was told it is actually up to the  Management at the building.When I contacted management again they then told me that the parking spot was previously given away to a tenant on floor 3  And that I would be put on a waiting list. It's pretty ridiculous that a tenet of 3 years would be put on the back burner compared to Tenets that just moved in ....How does someone I refer to mov in get a space in the same building 6 months after moving in and I'm just being placed on a waiting list ....I'm very disappointed with the way management has handle these situations besides the constant lies  And run around that I have been fed....it feels like your just here to pay rent and they could care less if you are unhappy and move out...I hope this situation can be resolved quickly so I can maybe have a better opinion!< /text>

Sorry, this is long over due......I hardly do Facebook , Twitter or any of this social media.  I still read my newspapers and glossy magazines.  I miss the dial up phone and the peace and quiet of the world.....all this technology is just too much .....

But anyways, back to the review....I like Avalon..... leasing office is great....always so helpful and lots of smiles and good coffee!!

Maintaince is great.  They will go beyond what's needed. Erick, Joe, and Renzo are the best.  They will help you with your maintenance needs...honestly.

I am not able to write a review  again......so I am updating this......love Avalon..   .they really understand your needs when you need a solution.   The trees at Avalon needed to be cut as the buds were falling on my balcony.  Christopher and Juan Franco was very helpful in pushing thus project ahead of time needed to be scheduled. Now I can finally enjoy my balcony without sweeping   over and over.!    Thanks Avalon!!!!!!< /Text>

<Text>It was a great start with the leasing experience.
However, once moved in, things started to go downhill.
The complex is dirty. They don’t upkeep the public areas. The corridors are filthy. They hardly ever pick up the trash in the elevator lobbies. The garage is filthy and there have been several robberies.
The move out experience was dreadful.
I was there for 1 short year and they confiscated my deposit and charged me ridiculous amounts for painting and cleaning. I never hung a picture on the wall! I never , in my renting experience, was charged for painting / cleaning.
I left the apartment in great condition.
Beware- they will take your deposit and force you to pay for painting and anything that is done to turn the apartment over to a new tenant.
I don’t recommend the Avalon at Woodland Hills.

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Athenna is an amazing individual. From the moment she greeted me to my move in day. I’ve lived here since June. I am used to luxury living but the apartment she found for me suits me. Top floor with one of the best views. I have been to many properties but the impression Athenna made is by far the best. Her charisma, and the way she carries herself is impressive. Very caring but mostly a sincere individual. Such an assett to this company. Athenna thank you for the experience thus far. Keep smiling and continue to be yourself. You will go very far in life. Companies will be very happy with the way you work and represent them. Thank you Avalon for the experience< /Review>< UserId.>

I called to see about an apartment and Athenna gave me full details and answered all my questions- she sold the property to me on the phone and what made it better was when i was able to put a face to her name- let me tell you about her personality. Nothing but amazing all around.best experience i have had . The process went so fast and productivs. She knows how to sell but mostly her charachter you cant find too much of. Thank you Athenna< /review>

<review>It was a great start with the leasing experience.
However, once moved in, things started to go downhill.
The complex is dirty. They don’t upkeep the public areas. The corridors are filthy. They hardly ever pick up the trash in the elevator lobbies. The garage is filthy and there have been several robberies.
The move out experience was dreadful.
I was there for 1 short year and they confiscated my deposit and charged me ridiculous amounts for painting and cleaning. I never hung a picture on the wall! I never , in my renting experience, was charged for painting / cleaning.
I left the apartment in great condition.

Athenna was my leasing contact and she has been a tremendous leasing agent. She made sure I got the apartment of my choice and walked through all the important stuff prior to move in. Her friendly nature only made the entire process even easier. Regarding the community, Avalon WH does sure seem very promising. The community is clean, frequent patrols by the security makes you feel secure, well maintained dog area, etc. So far I have had a very good experience with the move in and the first week, hope to have a good year of residence with Avalon WH.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>Daniel is a great person of contact, we moved from out of state and he was able to handle everything remotely without an issue. The complex is beautiful and is very pet friendly with a little fenced in area for dogs to run freely right on the side of the property. There is security patrolling the area, but I am concerned with the ease of non residents being able to access the facilities. There is a gate at the front of the complex but it remains open long enough for cars to tag along behind you. The pool and workout areas are accessed with a keyfob but I've seen other residents open the gate/doors for strangers who ask to get in. We've been here for about three weeks and I've seen the security guard several times throughout the day, which puts me at ease. It still makes me uneasy about these people potentially breaking into my mailbox, I wish those were more secure or had obvious security cameras.

But the complex is gorgeous and modern with nice utilities and a friendly staff.<//Text>< Pics>

Athenna Gets 5 Stars!!! She was Great, Lively, and Fun! I had such a Great Experience There meeting her, i felt like I Gained a New Friend! She is Awesome!! She gave me an Unforgettable informative and fun tour, where i laughed a whole lot and got Great information about the apts. The apts look nice, but the 3 stars are for their 3rd party approval company that they use along with their "Approvals," and so-called $150.00 move in "Special." My credit scores are Good! I Mean Good Enough To Get Approved for even more expensive apt complexes, loans etc! They pulled my credit, gave me a hard inquiry, and told me i need a cosigner or put down $1950 EXTRA!! Huh??!! No Way!!! That Sounded like a Scam To Me! I was Really confused and upset at first, but it just sounds like a game to me. Athenna is Great, but Avalons' "Approval" process is a Joke! No Thank You :(<//Text>

<Review>Security Deposit  - consider this a gift to Avalon Bay for the use of their facility. You will not be provided with a justifiable explanation for the confiscation of your security deposit.  I have no children and lived alone; there were no crazy red juice or wine stains left on the carpet and I even had a video in which I walked through the entire apartment. There were NO stains left within the carpet that a basic carpet shampooer could not remove. I only stayed in the unit for 7 months so it was not like I had worn the carpet down over time. Avalon Bay charged me $1000 for a full carpet replacement. Honestly it is not something I am angry over; it just saddens me that so many Corporate citizens have baked into their everyday business practices the act of gouging everyday citizens. I am actually in another one of their properties right now and you would think that would mean something to them. I feel awful that I have to pay a company like this rent for another 11 months when I know they could care less about me. Really crummy Avalon Bay. Very disappointed resident.  Also Avalon this is a rhetorical comment. I do not desire a response or pacification. I am simply informing fellow Californian residents of my experience with you. I do not need to be nor do I ever wish to speak to any representatives of your company again. I will pay my rent to you until I am able to free myself from you without a huge financial penalty.</Review>< Pictures>

But I really want to give a big thank you to the awesome Athenna for showing me the beautiful loft when I was making inquiries. It was a furnished loft and it was the last one available to rent. I was really impressed with all of the designs in loft and really pleased with how Athenna showed me the loft.  Athenna gave me a follow-up Call to see if I was still interested and made the paper work process really smooth. She was really friendly and very interactive and I really liked that about her personality. Even after move-in When she saw me around the residence she would still ask how I am enjoying the new place and if everything is okay with the unit. I'm in love with this place. Great team here at avalon Woodland Hills.</review>< username>

<GmapID>0x80c2993549284fa3:0xbb53ecc377cc0328<//GmapID>< Review>
I signed early 2018. My leasing agent was cordial and professional, Mr. Manny Montes, he made the contractual process very easy and I was very specific regarding which side/floor of the building I wanted my apartment located and he quickly found a suitable option which I agreed on; Athena who was not my primary leasing agent nonetheless she was also very respectful, accommodating and professional as well. First day I moved in my smoke detector was sounding off due to a low battery I walked down to the leasing office and was greeted by Sandra who assured me the service request would be resolved hopefully that same day but by the latest next day (it was already approaching late afternoon); sure enough Sandra got someone in 35 minutes, I was very impressed with the service she and her team executed... Sandra herself was very kind, caring and professional. In all, I have not had any issues and I'm enjoying my stay at the Avalon WH. I'm a prior home owner (market was high so I sold) and went back to renting so obviously I had my doubts about any rental lease I was going to sign as you always will find some kind of negative reviews on the internet, some truthful and some out of spite and revenge, mainly about unprofessionalism of staff, poor security, unclean/unsafe community Avalon WH had the least complaints if any so I trusted them as my new home, decent track record; lets face it renting is renting, owning is owning totally different worlds and experiences.</Review>

<Review>The staff was fantastic and the experience of living there was great. But, when it came time to move out they took my deposit and charged me for a full remodel. Carpets could have been shampooed but I take responsibility for the fact that there was normal wear and tear tracking by the front door instead ob just doing that room they decided to redo all the carpet in the apt. Again I don't mind paying for what I did but I was charged 200 for reprinting the whole unit when for the year that we lived there I never hung anything on the walls or had furnature up against them. I challenged this and a day later they said sent me an email saying "after carful review we deem these charges valid". When asked for proof they send me pictures of the floors and stuff they needed to clean but none of the walls. When asked why convienently there was no pictures of the walls they told me that pictures were a curtecy and not necessarily. This is the thing I'm 3 years sober live pay check to pay check trying to restart my life. Just now have I got my credit pack to normal. So I have to options take them to small claims court and it would cost more money that I don't have or let it mess up my credit and my mothers who consigned. Avalon is a big company know knows that so why not send me a bill when they know that I don't have a choice but to pay. Ps Daniel is amazing again only problem I had with Avalon is the bill they stuck me with after move out other than that they are fantastic.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2993549284fa3:0xbb53ecc377cc0328</gmapID></record>

< Review>
I lived for a year in here and from the get go it was bad, I'm a single mother two children, I when to sign the lease and paid the deposit every thing seem fine they where getting my money, they told me to come back to get the keys to move in in a week or so I did by then I have call every place to make the address change and have my stuff and kids with me, they told me we make a mistake we can't give you this apartment you have kids, which I stipulated from the beginning, the manager offer to find an apartment with in the area so I can move some where else, but I did not left I stood and for a whole year I recived constant complaints that I was too noisy even when I wasn't at the apartment, that my balcony was over saturated whit stuff which was emty, they complain about the poop of my dog and I don't have one, I have a washer and dryer inside the apartment, every time I used them they came to knock on my door that I was being noisy.
Finally the lease was almost up and they send me a rent increase for $400, so I turn down the new lease, I cleaned the apartment and have it ready for them one week before the lease was up they told me if you return your keys before the due date you have to pay $300, so I waited for the exact day printed on my lease which I have save just in case, they call me to let me know that I felt to follow the exact date to return the key and now I need it to pay $400, I was already out, so I told them I had the lease with me and the exact date as they indicated, they insisted for a $400 due so I said maybe we can settle this at court so the Judge can see the lease and how you have harras me for this whole year....
The person in charge said ok I will review the dates but if you have your lease with you we maight need a copy, I said I have it, she never call. me back again..
so do I recommend living here yea sure if you like this way of living.

In responce to Avalon management now, to the Avalon management I lived, doesn't sound as it has changed a great deal, in order to place a complain about any one in there has to go trough specific people that either don't care or whant to keep an image that is not real,  because of my review I got contact it by Avalon, where they confirmed I was I tenant there, I did not specified dates but they weren't happy I tell the truth, when I lived there I try solve the issues by talking to them and always it was as if I was talking to the wall, next day another fake complain of noise when most of the time my apartment was empty, because I was at work, it was annoying to arrive to complains  every day....

Why did I make a review now, because .... that is it just because...
the same reason  I got picked on then just because ... the only thing I did was to find a place to live and have children was enough for them to pick on me...
I do not want to cut a deal to remove my review it will stay, I did not sue then but I should have, and if there is any one else that is been on the same spot don't wait, they don't care about you, the money is  the only thing with value to them.</Review>

<review>The horrible place that I saw in my life. All the tenants call this complex LEAKY BUILDING. Because every time that the weather is raining you will see leaking  from the ceiling.  And when you call for service they come after two days and fix it  temporary and next time again leaking. The service is very poor.
We don't have any privacy they come to your apartment without any notice. Yesterday I was in the shower and they came to my apartment without any notice.
Different kind of bugs, spiders and scorpions are in home on the back hill you can find coyotes and snakes
Two times in a year somebody stole my stuff from the car.
Three times thieves stole my sons bike.
Several times I went to check mailbox and I saw nothing in and all the mailboxes was open.
Staffs are so impolite especially the manager Miss Melissa. she's very careless about tenant.
When somebody want to talk to manager she say always I'm busy and I can talk to you I will call back but she never called back anyone.
The first day that I was here to sign the lease they had nice smile and take care of us but after I signed they even know you who you are.
We sign lease and after finish my lease I will run away and never come back.< /review>< pictures>

What is good: Nice location with stores like Ralphs and Target within walking distance.Amenities like a dedicated dog park,a basic but clean gym and two nice pools + jacuzzis with barbecue areas.Management in the leasing office is responsive and helpful

The bad:Theft from mailboxes and tresspasing by homeless people is on the rise.Dog owners dont pick after their pets business.Coyotes roam the hills on the back of the property.Lighting is sketchy in corridors and common areas.

The ugly: Smell of weed is all pervasive throughout this property. Internal walkways and aisles have people smoking/vaping.Shady people in the east pool area during afternoons and the east exit gate.

Updated review 3/25/2017
I am updating the review since a lot has changed since I posted.We have since moved out but the move out experience was great.
Also there is now round the clock 24hr security that checks on all areas.Haphazard Parking in the internal streets has stopped because the parking agent asks you to move.Mailboxes have new locks and cameras.Smoking smell/weed smells have almost dissappeared maybe because of the cameras and screening for residents.The back of the property is now fenced off.
Much better property now than when we moved in.<//review><user>118390443594455684099< /user>< Resp>

God will welcome me anywhere we go pray to him 😐 also she said I didnt belong to that church how does she know I dont belong to this church. She was sending somewhere else. I like this one why not make the drive. But I guess i will not be returning.< /Review><GmapID>0x80db6ef2776849c7:0xf69bc95676e58c10</GmapID><user_id>115665798020125811230< /user_id></record>

Very happy that beyond meat is a featured product on the menu. The food was prepared timely and still fresh waiting for me after I ran a quick errand on the way to picking it up. I love the convenience of ordering online and the friendly employee helping me upon arrival.<//review>

One of my orders was left out and I had to go back for them, plus I had ordered 2 6pc wings with mild and medium and yet they both tasted exactly the same! Horribly disappointed in the wings especially for the price you pay. Def not going back< /Text>

Really cool guy here gave us a coupon that we didn't have which saved us like 10 bucks. And the pizza was great too! We've been coming to this one for years. The pan pepperoni is a fav at our house!< /text>

<Review>This location ruined Pizza Hut for me and my family. Called Pizza Hut around 5:15pm December 3rd for pick-up, first call I was put on hold then hung up on, called back same person answered and right off the bat I was rudely asked to "please hold" by the flamboyant man with an attitude. When he returned I gave him my name and number, oddly I wasn't in the system but we had ordered pizza from there for 2 years and also ordered a week earlier. He reluctantly told me specials upon request, I requested a $10 special "any way you want it" large pizza, he claimed this was online only but I had ordered the same exact thing the week before over the phone. Mind you I was never rude to this person just persistent, he decided to give me the deal after I mentioned I was given said special over phone several times. I admit as a person that prides himself in saving money with good deals I went crazy with the toppings, so I requested the pizza "well done" to not have pizza arrive soggy. Employee just disliked every single one of my requests from start to ending. Here's the kicker: My wife arrived with the pizza, popped the box open and at first glance it looked delicious then... I SPOTTED AT LEAST 6 LONG HAIRS AND 2 SHORT CURLY HAIRS BAKED INTO THE PIZZA!!! I pretended to accidentally drop pizza on the floor, didn't wanna bother my family with the gross details but also I didn't want to deal with contacting management and returning pizza for a refund. CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE WANTED ME AND MY FAMILY TO EAT THIS! Obviously person on the phone hated their job and or life, who am I to judge? But don't mess with my food... I decided this location would loose more if I never returned, way to loose a regular guys. Service always kinda sucked anyway and now this...<//Review><userid>117612379155190760035<//userid><Rate>1<//Rate><user_name>Psychobillynerd</user_name></record>

I would expext the presence of Manager to help out at cashier when their is a long line all the way outside. If you know your weekends are busy plan better. I was standing in line with my fiancé for an order we paid for. Should have had a second person jump in to help hand out paid order already. Disappointing for manager of this store</Review>

Called at 12:04am. Closes at 1:00am waited on phone for 21 minutes and they wouldn’t pick up phone!!! I guess the employees decided to make their own hours. So sad!!!<//Text>

<Review>I've had numerous bad experiences with this Pizza Hut.. I only order pizza from Pizza Hut and I ALWAYS order online, always, I order atleast a few times a month due to all the hungry boys in my house. One example of what terrible customer service they have was when they misread my address and went to the wrong address, called my number, gave me attitude for giving them the "wrong" address (even though it wasn't), was sarcastic, made snarky remarks, were an hour & a half late, saying that I ordered from the wrong Pizza Hut (again, I only order online so the computer automatically assigns which Pizza Hut is closest to my address), and did not show good customer service at all. When they came to my door, I gave them a $1 tip even though I probably shouldn't have given them a tip at all, and gave me a smug look. Another example was the numerous times I've had my order come in 1-2 hours late and had it just sitting in the restaurant until I had to call in questioning where my order is.. Other pizza places give you your order free if you're only 30 minutes late! Our house only likes pizza from Pizza Hut (none of them are a fan of Little Caesars, Domino's, Pepz, etc), so it's unlucky for us to be located near such a poor serviced Pizza Hut. Even right now I'm waiting on an hour late pizza that I bought for my uncle who is absolutely starving</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

They don't have parmesan cheese and pepper regularly.

We like a lot hanging out. Yesterday we arrived in this fine restaurant which we didn’t know before. We had a lovely experience there with exceptional cooking and a professional stuff and a great chief cook. We  added this venue in our phone list  and we will no doubt come back soon.  Highly recommended.< /text>

Their pizza is great! They have a good deal for 2XL pizzas. For their restaurant size it definitely stands up for itself. It does compare well to known pizza restaurants around the area.</review>

Pizza to greasy, no flavor. Hot wings are the worse hot wings I've ever tasted. The wings look weird. Over priced. Food is not good at all. Never going back.< /Review>

Lacking in flavor.  Spaghetti is lackluster,  meatballs were sliced, looked and tasted frozen. Pizza looked good but the taste is not good.  Poor quality cheese and sauce. Friendly staff, cozy eating area,  but it lacks.  It's for the budget minded.<//text>

This is a true neighborhood mom and pop shop. They keep the prices low and the pizzas hot. One topping pizza deals all day. Make sure to order it well-done.<//review>

Good price but that’s it. Wings were frozen and put thru the pizza oven to heat them back. The wings just fell apart and not crispy and tasted a little funny. The ranch was awful. It tasted like they squeeze the hidden hills ranch from the bottle. They couldn’t even make their own ranch, cheaper and ten times better. And the pizza tasted like little Caesar’s pizza but that explains the price. If you want pizza and wings go to deferent place.< /text>

Nelli (not sure if her name is spelled this way) is the best. We talked the entire time while my food was prepared and handed over to me. I learned a lot from her. You are the best. -Joseph from Krispy Kreme</Review>

<text>I was so excited to try this local spot and unfortunately they got my order wrong. I understand mistakes happen but was so surprised by the response I received which ranged from "Well the chef said he put pepperoni on it" to "well it's healthier for you this way."  I believe a refund or exchange of the item below was in order but instead I was told "I don't know what to tell you" and finally given a dollar off. Needless to say I was disappointed and won't be returning. I understand the error but definitely not the disrespectful response and lack of willingness to remedy a clear error.</text><resp>None< /resp><date>1607122229413<//date>< Pics>

This is the BEST pizza in Burbank, and some of the best pizza anywhere. Every ingredient is fresh, and the dough, sauce, etc. are made in house. On top of that, it’s a family run business, and their service is the highest quality. Support this incredible place, and enjoy!</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Pretty upset, I placed an order online and the location said specifically their orange grove location...I get to the place and it says it’s closed temporarily... So I went and ordered from another restaurant. 1 hour later and I get a call that my pizza is ready. I’m not expecting of a discount or anything like that but an apology would have sufficed. They acted like nothing was wrong... it’s not hard to update a website. It takes less than 5 minutes to remove a non-existent location. Or if that’s not manageable for some reason to call the customer prior to the food being finished to let them know where it will actually will be picked up.

On a food note... the pizza was unusually light, literally. It weighed less than a pound and I thought for a moment that I walked out with an empty box. The actual flavors were meh at best.

Overall, I’m really disappointed by their food and their customer service and I encourage others to order from other pizzerias around town.< /Text>< Pics>

I have given this place three opportunities to do right. Last night was the worst ever. I ordered online at 7:38 p.m. I gave them 40 minutes to complete order. It was stated on the website it would be ready in 20 minutes. I knew better because my previous experiences they were very slow. The food is very good so I gave it a third chance. I arrived mind you, 40 minutes later to a restaurant that was in disarray. They confirmed my order and said it wasn't ready yet could I give them four more minutes. I gave them 10 minutes. They brought me an order that wasn't mine. The lady behind the counter said to me amazingly. "Don't ask me I just got here." I was amazed. The chef came forward and apologize and said they put the order in the wrong place give him 4 minutes and he'll make the  pizza. I said please take the time to make the pizza right. 15 minutes later I got my pizza. I am so confused how they confirmed my order 30 minutes earlier in person. An hour earlier online and nothing was completed till after I got there. I have to say the food was good still but how much can a company screw up and not even act like anything's wrong. Probably the last time I'm going there for at least three to four months and then I'll forget and go back and experience the same experience. I guess that's the true definition of insanity. Really it's my hope that a local business that's one block for my house can service my account . I hope it's not a pipe dream.< /Review>

Just had a pizza from there. WASTE OF money.   It was as nasty as Dominos but cost$20 more
Couldn't find the pepperoni! It should be called high end pizza not North  RUINED our game day feast.fake reviews for sure!!! So go to one of the other many pizza places if you like thin and Really good Pepperoni  go to Pinball or try Reno s on  Riverside dr.< /review>

WORST CALZONE ever and for north of $15 almost 20 dollars the sausage was YUCK crust was dry overcooked no sauce on side.  Called and they didn't want to make it right.  Well done getting reviews with FAKE positive reviews and a Owner who is absent and place  poorly managed.  And GET RID OF your pizza oven that you don't use except to imply you are wood FIRE and ARE NOT!!<//text>

The worst calzone I have ever had. On top of the dry crust and gritty ricotta, the sausage and mushrooms were disgusting. AND it cost me about $17 to drive to them to get it. Most overpriced and gross food I have ever eaten.</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Horrible, horrible food.  I was so looking forward to a Friday evening of good pizza based on all these great reviews.  I'm all for supporting independent local businesses, but when they are far inferior to the national brands, I have to go with my stomach.  The calzone was 80% air and only had 4 pepperonis with little else.  The BBQ chicken pizza was paper thin, almost no chicken and sauce and really had no flavor.  Believe me, I make matzo with butter and salt that has more flavor.  After we were done eating, I asked my family if they wanted to order out for dinner or eat leftovers.  Very disappointed.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>North End Pizzeria by far is one of my favorite pizzas.  The basic pizza is phenomenal.  The crust has the right balance of soft and crunch textures, not too thick, and knows how to hold onto the fantastic tangy sauce and a well-balanced cheese blend.

Even the restaurant is a really cool hangout space!

Reason why I gave poor rating:.

I ordered today the Ole Ironsides pizza (on menu it's advertised as combo of 4 meats) but seems like what I got was more like the Great Brinks Pizza Robbery.  There was no prosciutto and no meatball on the pizza, just a pepperoni and sausage pizza .  I asked for a side of sauce and was brought 1Tablespoon of sauce to my table and was told that will be 82¢.  The kicker was when I pulled my 2 cellphones out of my pocket, didn't realize I was being watched, then was swarmed upon and hovered drone-like in wonderment of what I was doing with 2 cellphones.  Was I writing some comments online?  Critiquing the food?  Just checking my emails?  Wouldn't they like to know?<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I love pizza. It's hard to find great pizza in Los Angeles. There's plenty of good pizza, but GREAT pizza is hard to come by. North End is the best. Their pizza reminds me of my college days at Boston College. When in Burbank, go to North End!<//Text>

Really delicious pizza, has a small selection of local brewery beers. The only downside is that an XL pizza and a couple glasses of beer is over 40 bucks. There are other local pizza joints that have bigger pizzas for $14.<//text>

<Text>They only gave us 5 pepperoni on a 8in pizza. Barely one pepperoni per slice. Is there a shortage on pepperoni that we don't know about? I'm sure the $9 pizza can cover a few more pepperonis on a pizza. Pizza wasn't even worth it. They don't even use the brick oven that's right there in front! It's all for show. Better off going to the Pizza Hut down the street.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Best pizza anywhere. I recommend double pepperoni and double garlic cooked in the brick oven. Go triple if you're feeling it. Even better.</review>

The only place to get pizza in Burbank. This new location looks great from the multiple flat screens to the brick walls, can't be beat. I've been looking for a long while to find some authentic NY style pizza, you know the one, that crust has to be just right. Northend has it right. The people here are friendly and you can tell that the owner really cares about his employees and customers.

tl;dr - you found the right pizza place. Go ahead and call the order in, you won't regret it.</text>

< review>
Lived there for ~9 months, early terminated to move back to south bay.

Good:
- Good price in this area
- 90% Quiet & good structure to block outside noise
- Staff is good.
- Good gym with squat machine - better than south bay ones.

Bad:
-2 inner-noise. The exhausting pipe is connected to neighbor's living room. They had a crying baby at 6am. And suddenly it became my problem and disrupted my sleep. They should either offer discount or allow people to know what family composition is in their neighbor. Imaging flying a overnight plane every night with a crying baby onboard.
- $300 parking fee - well, it is SF. can't blame anyone
- Still pricy, but it is SF</review>

My experience here living with @fvcproductions in another review has been great! I've been here for 1.5 years about. The rent is moderately high but totally reasonable in that you have all the amenities you need in-unit and a nice modern look.

The place has a gym, a rooftop shared area, a hot-tub (that's honestly usually empty), an outdoor grill, stove/washer/dryer/dishwasher in unit, etc etc. Convenient friendly and clean!< /Text>

A Lovely Place to Live, With Super Service and Personnel

Rincon Green Apartments is a great place to call home. The community is extremely beautiful, well-kept and peaceful. In fact, everything is so beautiful that I felt like I lived at a resort. The staff always greet residents with a smile, are very attentive to their needs and are quick to attend to any problems that arise. I would like to give special kudos to maintenance worker Andrew and property managers Laila and Janae. Once, I spilled laundry detergent on my apartment's carpet, and I was in a panic because I really don't like the sticky, messy feeling of the laundry detergent residue. I submitted the service request in the morning and Andrew helped me do a deep cleaning of the entire apartment's carpet the same day! What an awesome service! Laila and Janae from the leasing office are super helpful and accommodating. They always try their best to make residents' stay in the community as comfortable as possible. My initial apartment was faced the street, and I couldn't get used to the noise. After learning about the issue, Laila and Janae immediately transferred me to a quiet courtyard apartment at a discounted price. My sleeping quality has since improved significantly!

The apartment could not be in a better location and is close to many shops, grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, bars and transportation options. It offers some of the most cutting-edge designs and boutique amenities in the area. Amenities include a community park, rooftop lounge with a hot tub and grill (I have thrown two BBQ parties here, and my guests had a great time and were extremely satisfied), a 24-hour fitness center, concierge and cyber café, on-site Zipcar and panoramic city views. The apartment is within walking distance of the downtown financial district, SOMA, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Visa, MasterCard, and all the major tech companies. It is also just a10-minute walk to Embarcadero Boulevard, where you can enjoy breathtaking views of the bay and the Bay Bridge!

In summary, I really enjoyed my time here, as the apartment was very clean, comfortable and had everything I could need! In addition, the maintenance worker is super-efficient, and the office staff are friendly. I will always recommend this fabulous apartment to others!<//Review>

Also, they are excellent at handling deliveries and packages.

2 years later... Still great!

Rent increases have been reasonable. Two years in a row they offered NO increase IF you renewed early, though sadly not doing that at the moment (Jan 2019)

Did I mention every unit has built in, stacked clothes washer and dryer that they maintain!?  No more shared laundry room nonsense, this was a HUGE point for me personally; your priorities may vary.  And these are small-ish, somewhat compact machines, so you can’t do “gianormous loads”, but a reasonable amount is fine. Dishwasher is also a bit more narrow than full sized ones, at least in my studio apartment, but it works, just smaller loads.

The next 3 topics may sound like negatives, but it’s an attempt to keep a well running building, so I’m not making judgement calls here, just offering “full disclosure”

Temp parking pass is needed even for an hour, and it’s $40, even if you only use 1 hour. I’m guessing they keep it high so SF visitors don’t use it for a generic parking garage, so it’s a bit above regular parking garages, but maybe by only $10 or something - parking in SF SoMa/Financial district is expensive, especially if there’s a game or some other big event.

EV charging: There are a few EV charging station in basement level 2, I forget the service.  3 slots, but there’s usually a vacant slot. I think you still need to pay the $40 if you’re a guest, plus the RV service charge.

AirBNB-able?  ABSOLUTELY NOT. SF may allow it in some buildings, but not here. And it can be a first-offense eviction, and the staff knows the tenants pretty well, and there’s security RFID on the elevators, and I think they maybe even do spot checks for ads, so don’t do it, you’ll likely be caught and possibly evicted.

Also, zero smoking or vaping, can also be an eviction. And no, going out on the balcony or trying to blow smoke into a vent won’t work - it’s a very “green” building so smoke doesn’t dissipate and they will hunt people down if they get complaints.

But again, this is just info to consider, for many of us residents it works out great!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>We love living here so much that we have recently renewed our lease. Although it is not cheap to live here, we appreciate all the valuable services that this building provides, at a very reasonable rate. You could surely get cheaper, but you will have to deal with shady landlords.

Rincon Green is run by Emerald Fund, who have the most fantastic staff: Laila and Vanessa manage the building, while Sarah and Emyli are the friendliest leasing agents around. Make sure you tell them about my review. They organize monthly get-togethers to introduce you to your neighbours. Joey and Cameron watch over the concierge desk during the day, making sure to sign for our deliveries and greeting guests. At nights, there is very friendly security and the park gates are locked. Jerry and Jairell are maintenance and they make sure everything is in tip-top shape. It's a new building, built in 2012, but when we had trouble with the heat and plumbing, they showed up right away!

The building is really lovely, there's Emerald Park as our front yard, with a playground for the little ones to climb on. Inside the building, there's a courtyard with a rock garden and water fountain. If you get a unit with a balcony, it's easy to forget you are actually living in a big city. There is free Philz coffee in the morning, with complimentary tea throughout the day. We really enjoy using the rooftop hot tub after working out in the nice gym on the first floor. And there's also a couple of communal gas grills for quick no-mess dinners.

As for the units, they are a little small, but with good furniture a couple can live comfortably in a 1-bedroom apartment. You can find the floor plans on their website. Each unit comes with apartment-sized appliances: washer, dryer, stove and oven, microwave, and fridge. Since this is an eco-friendly building, there solar-powered heat but no air-conditioning. Since SF doesn't get that hot or cold, we keep the windows open most of the time. If you need a parking space, that's extra, but they do have ports for cars to charge.

We don't really need one, because there are three Zipcars available in the parking garage. And we ride our bikes, which are safely locked up in the storage rooms. You also get Webpass for Internet, which is speedy and reliable. They have Laundry Lockers downstairs if you want someone else to handle your clothes. You can also rent a storage locker, but I think they have a deal with Omni for on-demand storage. And they have a deal with Zeel for discounted massages.

There are a couple of disadvantages though: the sidewalks in the area are often unusable due to the condos popping up all over Rincon Hill. There is also the new Transbay Terminal that is being built, so it does get noisy on the weekends. And since it's close to the Bay Bridge, with its on- and off-ramps, traffic does back up on Harrison St.<//text>< user>

<Response>None</Response><review>This place is usually pretty busy. Drinks range from $4-$6 and they have a fair selection of pastries. Seating is modern and brightly lit. Usually a good amount of people working in the cafe or on work calls. Wait times are what you would expect from Blue Bottle, a little longer than your average chain cafe. But it's worth the extra wait, the quality of coffee and beverages is much higher. Parking can be challenging, there are both street spots and garage spots within walking distance. Navigating the inside of the cafe with a stroller can be tight.< /review>< user_id>

<Review>Nice place to sit and have a coffee inside or outside. Pretty area in Oakland. Been there twice. Iced coffee is great. Daily brew is okay. I enjoy watching the employees make the coffee. They have it set up to see the process of the coffee being made. This is a picture of the summer brew in the cute cup.< /Review>< resp>

Hipster crossed with corporate.
High prices.
Slow service.
No customizations (go to Starbucks for some menu choice)
Don't take cash.
Don't offer a receipt unless you give their marketing your email address.
Coffee was not worth the price and was not really hot.
All these things were blamed on coronavirus</Text>

Great coffee, slow service.
I think this workers here don’t like Latin man. Everyone that ordered after me got their drink and when I asked for mine they said “sorry, we got to do the drinks in order”  so I tell them that is was exactly the point of my complaint. They looked at each other and laughed.
I will never go back to any of Oakland locations.   Too bad because  coffee is made right but management is terrible. Don’t loose your time going there, unless you are white.< /text>

I've been coming here nearly every workday for the last few weeks. The staff are all very friendly and inviting. I usually get tea, as opposed to coffee, but their tea is really favorful - something that always gets me going in the morning. The space is very open, with plenty of seating for the volume of customers they routinely have, most of which buy to go. I've only used their bathrooms twice, but each time the space was surprisingly clean, considering there are no locks on the doors (big difference compared to places like Starbucks which require keys or combinations to access their bathrooms).

Overall, if you are one for picking up a cup of Joe in the morning - or if you're a tea drinker like me - I definitely recommend this spot!< /Text>

Today I came down to get my usual drink and they told me it was an inconvenience I wish they hadn't told me it was inconvenient to make it the first time I came here in the second time in the third time blue bottle and old Oakland don't ever have to worry about the attitudes are really bad here the baristas you really don't want to deal with the baristas they have an attitude all their own not good for customer service I will never get a anything from them again</Text>

<review>The food was amazing.  We had pizzas and Caprese and salad and desert and everything was amazing.  Such good food, such great service.  Some of the best mozzarella and balsamic ever.  Only thing was that there were a LOT of people in there without masks.<//review>< Date>

<Name>Collins Forbes<//Name><Date>1622309274254</Date><Rating>5< /Rating><review>A true gem in Fullerton. Came to dine in with my family for my aunts birthday. We knew it was gonna be good by the scent right when we stepped in. We were seated right away, even without a reservation, and were helped immediately. From their table salt to their flour to their prosciutto, everything is imported from Italy. And you can taste the authentic, fresh flavors. Truly an experience and we will be back! They even offered us a gelato on the house for my aunts birthday!! Customer service is perfect and the food is amazing!<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
The food was pretty good and service was great. Both my girlfriend and I got the Margherita Pizza. We also ended up getting the Nutellamisu for dessert which was a 5/5, so good. The pizza was good but nothing crazy. The crust itself however was delicious. Overall the pizza was like a 4/5. I’m giving this place a full five stars cause i truly did enjoy my meal and also we got seated so quickly on Mother’s Day of all days and the food came out so quick. Our server also did a great job at coming by and asking us if we needed anything and whenever we did need anything she was able to get it done quickly.<//review>

Been coming here for years and it had been a while. Nothing's changed, still best pizza in So. Cal. I had the Diavola and was tasty, as usual. The best thing is the dough... So glad they brought that brick oven all the way from Napoli.<//Text>

Absolutely amazing! Truly authentic Neapolitan style pizza, and the appetizers were on point as well. Closest we have had to actual Italian pizza in Naples, Italy. Definitely brought back memories!< /text>

If I could give this restaurant a 6/5 stars I would! I am a pizza enthusiast (lol) and this is seriously some of the best pizza I’ve had in California. Matches the quality and taste of those from Italy. Also a good wine selection and and a great atmosphere to sit down and enjoy a meal (post pandemic that is). Good job Fuoco!</review>

< Review>
We moved from LA to Fullerton in 2018 and since then Fuoco has been out pizza Mecca every Monday.

The dough is made like in Italy, very thin and the crust is crispy on the edge. They use good quality products and we LOVE TO SUPPORT a family business!

Many options to chose from but I’m a fan of the Capriciosa. The service is impeccable and the team always friendly.

We strongly recommend!</Review>

Get the Quattro Salumi pizza.

This place is literally built on it: Italian pizza oven, imported Italian ingredients, and numerous awards won because of it.

Sure, the pear salad was really refreshing and balanced-and could've gotten a good review by itself-but the star is the meat lover pizza.

The neopolitan-style pizza has the satisfying  indulgence that fulfills any pizza craving. The rich cured meats is complimented by the robust and tangy tomato sauce. The airy soft crispy crust turns into nice breadsticks to scoop back every bite of umami goodness dropped.

They can also make anything gluten-free and have a wide variety of pizzas. They are all good, but the Quattro Salumi is in a league of its own.

I have been here multiple times and have never left hungry or disappointed.

5 stars for sure.<//Review>

The pizza is actually really good here. My only problem is they tend to burn it, and will send it out knowing its burned. Check the bottom of the slice before you put it in your mouth. I've gotten chucks of burnt coal stuck to the bottom of mine more than once.<//Text>

The Pizza was kind of bad. I had the Margherita Pizza and it was kinda like eating a really crispy tortilla and all the toppings just fell off when you picked it up. I'm pretty disappointed with the 15 bucks that I've spent on a Pizza. I don't think I'll go back there.<//Review>

<Text>It was just OK. The spinaci salad was good. Yummy actually. I liked it better than the cortadina pizza we got. Maybe I'm not used to the style but the pizza was very wet. I don't mind eating with a fork and knife but it was disappointing. The worst part was the water. I do care about clean good tasting water. Sad to say I ordered an americano so I didn't need to drink the water.</Text>< pics>

<Text>Delicious wood fired pizzas. Once you have this style of pizza you’ll never go back to ordering American style pizzas.
Delicious crust and flavorful pizzas, not greasy at all. Their Margherita pizza is the best I’ve ever had.
Their pizzas are served the tradition way of unsliced and eager with a fork and knife.<//Text>< Pics>

First time here and we recommended to come by our kids. Never had authentic pizza like this and it was a wonderful treat. Homemade crust with fresh ingredients makes this a definite pleasure for the palate. I loved how the garlic and olive oil blended with the cheese which was sprinkled with basil. Honestly I am not a huge fan of red sauce but Fuoco 's sauce was like nothing I had before. It made me change my mind.
Glad your restaurant has preserved thru all this craziness. We will be back soon.<//review>

Having lived in Naples (Navy), Fuoco is as close as it gets to authentic Neopolitan pizza. Highly recommended.< /review>

<Review>Excellent place to get stone oven wood fired pizza with all the authentic sides.  Fast and courteous service from the wait staff. Pricing is on par with similar genres restaurants.

I would definitely stopping by again the next time I’m in town.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzCVhnj5rf-_fTbhT1BIKUtlqtYUr3HPICZ1WI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwaJ9AJzJQQPDCtXXpMURYXfL51Em-zBnh1XVB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Doesn't look like much when you walk past it, but this place has the best pizza in Fullerton. They are practically like a hole-in-the-wall and provide brick oven fire pizza. The dough is unique and chewy. They typically don't cut the pizza either like an OG. Their pizzas are on the smaller size so order lots! They have fantastic options and their Margarita pizza is incredible.

TIP: Asked to get your pizza sliced</Review>

This is my favorite pizza place in Fullerton. Authentic fork and knife style. This is not your chain delivery type place. They're so friendly as well. I like the black truffle.</Review>

Oh where to start... the Service and food here are top notch. Many Italian places claim to be authentic but definitely don’t taste authentic. Fuocco has authenticity and excellence you can taste.<//Text>

The olives aren't your typical weak black olives, they serve them green and delicious.  Highly recommend the mozzarella as an appetizer.  They're fresh from Italy.  Also, an excellent selection of wine and craft/import beers.  Was very pleased and walked around downtown after.  Plenty of stuff to do in the area.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcd5f7e3d8bcbd:0x2d4944875dce16a0< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Cool little spot, got there right before the dinner rush and sat at the Bar. Hana and Tamy are great and the pizza was an authentic Italian style and comes out quickly. I kept it simple with the Diavola and was happy I did because it was good.< /review>

this is the most legit and delicious napoletana style pizza in so cal in my opinion, the crust is so tender and soft, and the toppings are authentic and fresh. employees are kind and are attentive, the restaurant and bathrooms are clean and well stocked. 3 hour parking is behind the restaurant but seems to be close to full a lot because there's so much in the area. a must go-to for some really great pizza<//Review>

This is a place anyone who like pizza should try. The place is cozy with a classy feel. There are TV's on the walls if you want to watch sports while you are eating. There is a great wine/beer selection. The cheeses are some of the best. I prefer the chiattone calzone (think full sized pizza with dough over the top) although everything was really great. The ingredients are top notch. The tiramasu was to die for... I always look for an excuse to eat here again.<//review>

This place is AMAZING! I love the small business atmosphere. The couple times I've been here Ari has been out server. He goes above and beyond and I love that the drinks are included with your meal. The food is really good. I love the Denver skillet and a friend recommends the Zorro eggs Benedict. Can't wait to come back!<//Review>

What an Amazing Establishment! Long known about it and never visited, until now! After a visit to Naples Italy, the pizza eating has never been the same, life changing! Today l got a hunch within to look up this spot once more having recalled reading a few key things about it, family owned, true Naples style, real oven and maybe one more thing.
Well as l entered, quick to see the Oven, the Owner and Logo on menu indicating Verace Pizza Napoletana! The antipasti arrived and each bite was spot on! The Pizza? That unmistakable flavor that l got while at Da Michelle and Sorbillo? Oh it hit! And hit Nice!! I was filled with joy instantly to recognize what an AMAZING job they were doing here!
Napoli is the Motherland yes, here l got a taste of that though, not easily done yet the hit it here, GRAZIE!!</Review>

The Cannoli is great! Pizza was so-so (sauce too acidic, dough a little salty) and missed the neopolitan pizza sweet spot for me.</review>

The pizza tastes very good, but they use too little ingredients. We ordered 3 pizzas and got some slices with only tomato sauce<//text>

Good place for food, the cheese was super melty and it felt like a cheese tsunami was happening in my mouth, only criticism is that there was a long wait but for what we got, the wait was worth it<//Text>

This an amazing place. Great service , great authentic pizza and worth every penny. Party of 4 got 4 pizzas and all of them were exceptional. Twice the price of blaze for a bigger pie that's 100 times better.</review>

<review>Looked good at first but... it just falls apart , still doughy, soggy, under cooked and nice burn on the bottom. They rushed it and put it at too high of a temp. Even Colorado has better pizza, and not even a speck compared to NY.

Way over priced too. $9 for a salad, what a joke</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHyNv2bDd1RoOpZ4stNETnUG_EGvh9cptIp5CQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwW5ekuz-Svqkis649HlH6jiQlv7TQ44aom1bh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

At Fuoco, you are getting downright good pizza that is authentically Italian and excellent customer service that is fast, friendly and attentive. Honestly, we couldn't have asked for a better first visit. We took home leftovers and finished it the next day, which was still delicious after popping it in the toaster oven for a few minutes. You can bet on us being back again. Highly recommended!</Review>

Really enjoyed dinner here... Visiting from out of town but would most definitely come back here for dinner. Pleasant greeting when we walked in, friendly waiter and attentive staff.  Favorite dish was gnocchi in pink sauce. Favorite dessert was trio of gelato!<//Text>

The only reason why I don't give this place 5 stars, is that it's a little bit expensive but if you want amazing authentic Italian pizza this is the place~ super good!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

This place is absolutely delicious. The staff is always really helpful and knowledgeable about the menu if you need any suggestions. I've dined in and done take out and the food is consistently made well. There aren't too many places around here that do "European" style pizza.<//text>

Such fresh tasting, delicious food! Their pizzas are wonderful - they have a lot of flavor combinations to choose from.  Their salads are super fresh and yummy - unique flavors too. Made me feel like I was eating in Italy (which I have done in the past). Portions are large and the staff was on top of everything (we had a group of over 20 people). I've been here with a smaller group too and had the same great experience.< /text>

Very nice place, service was great! Their pizzas are delicious, menu reads individual size, they are thin but large enough to share, it has 6 slices. Thecaprese panini was ok, but I was expecting a hot sandwich with melted cheese, not a cold sandwich. Beers and wine selection is short but perfect for their menu.< /Review>

< Review>
Top notch, service and food quality are 5/5. Pricing is also very reasonable for quality of food, roughly $10-20 of a pizza depending on which one you get and $5 for a beer. Atmosphere is great and warm. The staff is very friendly with service and explain the menu if you have any questions. Would recommend and definitely coming here again, some of the best pizza.<//Review>

<Text>So starting off with Pros. Ambiance really welcoming clean aesthetics service was great attentative. Cons Food was sub par got the pizza was a soupy mess around the middle with water from cheese and fat from pork building a puddle. Then Evey slice had charred dough. I expect some blister mild charred but every slice had it, reminds you of burned outside of toasted marshmallow, that was every slice, I started cutting out at one point. Definitely over cooked,
Not terrible but I wouldn't revisit.< /Text>< rate>

Ordered the black truffle pizza and pesto one too.  The pizza my god was sublime in texture and flavor. They had some masters make this.
I just wish it wasn't as expensive. This place is so close to being perfect< /Review>

<Review>A wonderful Napoletana pizza restaurant! Traditional 12" pizza. They don't cut it which is how we like to eat it, with fork and knife. If you like it sliced they are happy to do that. Red sauce was delicious. They have the rapini & Italian sausage pizza. They have buffalo mozzarella too mmmmmmm! Pizza comes out lightening fast! The crust is amazing! You have to try this place! We will be back soon. Parking is in the back</Review>< Pics>

Wandering in tonight looking for a new experience with the family. Found this place to be the kind of place we plan to come back to. Excellent service and the food was delicious. The portions are generous and everything tasted so fresh! We cannot wait to go back and try something else. My husband loved the variety of beers they had to offer. The kids loved their desserts too! 5+ stars all the way!< /review>

Ordered a margarita pizza.  As far as Neapolitan pizza goes, it is very average, wouldn't go out of my way to go there.  The crust was not airy, it was a very dry crunch, also the char overwhelmed the flavor of the crust.  The sauce had no depth, just very plain.  They do not cook the pizza at the right temperature. They should have a large flame in the oven in order to cook the pizza in less than 90 seconds.< /review>

This is a great place for pizza! Not your typical run-of-the-mill pizza. No. This is an artisanal type of pizza, as it is made in Naples, Italy. A thin hand-tossed, wood oven-baked pizza that is out of this world. It is meant to be eaten quickly. Why? Because the moisture of the sauce, cheese and toppings make the thin-crusted pie soggy after a while. Don't take long to eat it. Another thing I can recommend is the panini--excellent choice--served with a generous green salad. I have only been there for lunch, at which time there is no waiting. In the evening, I do not know nor can I guarantee that you won't be waiting.<//text>

This place is actually pretty expensive. That being said, you get what you pay for fully. Absolutely fresh, handmade, beautiful everything. And, it's definitely stayed true to Italian roots. Definitely plan on trying this, just know that it isn't a quick cheap meal.<//text>

Cheese is soft creamy, chewy and not too salty. Melts well. Crust is very delicate and gets soggy pretty quickly with sauce and cheese. Hard to hold up the slice without it falling apart. Also could use more basil on the margheritas.</Review><Rating>3<//Rating><user_id>101037186332544497248<//user_id><Pics>None</Pics>< gmap_id>

I had a pizza with smoked mozzarella cheese and mushrooms and I liked both of those ingredients. What I'm not used to was the marinara sauce. I couldn't taste any herbs so, to me, the sauce tasted sweet and I'm really not a fan of sweet tomato sauce. I would be willing to give this place another shot.< /Text>

Not busy, a lot of table dirty.Waited 5 minutes before a server greet us.
Two servers approached table, they did not suggest any item on the menu.
Pizza very chewy, almost not completly cook inside. I will not come back.</review>

I love the pizza here, but it's a hit or miss. Came here four times already. Last time they tried to serve me margherita pizza soggy and wet that was loaded with parmesan cheese. I never asked for parmesan and brought the pizza mess  to the waiters attention. Got a replacement quickly, but I shouldn't have to ask to fix a soaked pizza...< /Text>

Fuoco has some of the best Neapolitan pizza in the area! I have been to similar places and I feel that Fuoco beats them out for sure. The staff is so warm, and attentive. They have your order in and before you know it, the pizza is out! They cook so fast in their oven. Also, they have a great happy hour menu with mini pizzas and salads. I would recommend going for this menu for sure.<//Text>

The restaurant put out a beautiful spread of salads, meat & cheese plates, bruchetta, olives; then came the absolutely scrumptious pizzas.  I'm telling you this place is primo! Definitely a place we'll return to for more good eats. Staff was absolutely attentive, friendly and quick to remove empty dishes.</Text><username>Linda M< /username>< userid>

Stopped in for lunch recently. Very authentic Neapolitan style pizza is the calling card and they had quite a few unique options on the menu. They can also put any of their pizzas on a gluten-free crust, if needed. If you park in the lot behind the building, there's a back entrance. No patio seating is available.<//review>

The pizza here is pretty tasty. Really like the Bianca pizza with garlic, olive oil, cheese and arugula.  They also have the far out IPA which is really unique in flavor.<//Review>

This is the best pizza I've ever had!! I feel bad saying that as my mother is a full blooded Sicilian, and her pizza is amazing, however she agrees! After eating here all I can think about is their pizza and calzones! My parents live in San Diego and ask me to bring some down for them every time I visit now, or we go there every time they visit! This is true Italian food!</review>

So far the closest to what an Italian would call a pizza. It was a bit too saucy for my taste, but the dough was very good and the toppings too. Had a very nice experience here<//Review>

<text>This is real Italian food, not Americanized food. The restaurant is clean and sparcely decorated, although there are TV's if you must watch.... The service is fast and efficient. The pizza's are well made and tasty - I ate at least two slices of her pizza! My calzone was not what expected.... It was prepared nicely, but needed more ingredients inside..... Overall, it was a good time with good food. I would go again for the pizza.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I don't give 5 stars to anybody, but the happy hour at this Italian family owned place deserves it right out. I started out with the tomato basil mozzarella dish and the happy hour smaller pizza and the discounted beer from tap. highly recommended for pizza fans. meutermedia<//text>

So far the closest to what an Italian would call a pizza. It was a bit too saucy for my taste, but the dough was very good and the toppings too. Had a very nice experience here< /Review>

<Review>Chicken parmesan pizza is FIRE. But this place doesn't serve ranch... WHAT A LOAD OF BRICKS. Otherwise, I would have rated it a full 5 stars. Their margarita pizza is not good. Don't get it. On Mondays it's $5 with a purchase of another pizza at normal price, but it's only worth getting if you're feeding your kids it... Kids who have no say in how food should taste.</Review>< Pics>

The pizzas only come in one 12" size which is good for just 2 people. The slices are cut into 4 quarters. Even though it was delicious, it's hard to justify $15-$18 for just 4 thin slices of pizza.

This is what all pizza should be. Perfect crust with that crisp exterior and chewy interior, good quality sauces and cheeses, fresh toppings. You'll spend a little more than at pieology or a place like that, but it is worth every dime...and this place is definitely cheaper than some Neapolitan places. Very good food here, and given the nature of how it is cooked, the service is generally pretty quick (and very friendly).<//Text>

This is one of my family's favorite places hands down. The pizza is so good, so fresh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The Vesuvio (sp?) is my favorite, with its smoky mozzarella and prosciutto.<//Review>

This is one of my family's favorite places hands down. The pizza is so good, so fresh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The Vesuvio (sp?) is my favorite, with its smoky mozzarella and prosciutto.< /Text>

<text>Fuoco had excellent Italian Pizza. I love the thin crust and the pizza cooks in a few minutes. I absolutely love the fuoco and chicken pesto.  The fuoco has no sauce,  truffle oil, arugula, prosciutto...and is just perfect for my taste. They have specials, appetizers and desserts.</text>< name>

<text>My favorite pizza place in OC.  Actually, this is the only place that makes me crave pizza.  The ingredients are fresh, the cheese are real, not processed, the meats are high quality italian meats, and the sauces taste great.  Its a pizza that taste like a nice dinner rather than fast food.</text>< Pics>

The food really is authentic. Their imported mozzarella and their Naples style pizza is better than what I had in Italy last summer!!<//Text>

First time today, loved the pizza and the salad, very different from the usual Pizza, fresh ingredients.  Wonderful.  Have not had the old fashioned kind of pizza bread before.  You can skip the cannoli though...!  Loved Fuoco's   will go back.< /text>

Closest restaurant to napoli style pizza west of Italy. The staff are friendly and nice. All of the ingredients are imported from Italy and the appetizers and pizzas are phenomenal. My favorite items are the fuoco pizza and involtini ai sapori appetizer. I believe the owner immigrated from napoli and started this restaurant. I highly recommend trying this place.</text>

<Text>Had a clement family lunch here Fuoco pizza is made at the time of your order and fired in a 1000 degrees oven---it's classic Neapolitan style cuisine from the Naples region.

Burrata is fresh creamy mozzarella from Italy and Caprese is served with sliced tomato, leafy green basil, drizzled with imported extra virgin olive oil and presented like art on white dinnerware.

12 inches are the individual size for pizza (called Pizze on menu).  Neapolitan pizza is served unsliced and may be devoured with a fork and knife. This Pizze/ Pizza is tasty and served in a warm atmosphere.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
I would like to first start by saying the food is as delicious as it is beautiful.  The pizza is baked to perfection; the crust is crunchy and light. The proportion of cheese and sauce are perfectly distributed with a touch of basil. I am currently enjoying the Diavola pizza (spicy salami ). By far my favorite pizza fuocos offers. Of course that varies by preference. I love spicy foods and can be plain at times. I personally think that the pizzas are best when paired with the Peach Iced tea. The sweetness of the tea balances the spice in the pizza, the tea isn't too sweet and is bottled. However, you are given a cold glass for your tea. The owner is an amazing cook and sweetheart. He comes across very serious,  but has given me the best service in the house, with the exception of Rosa. Rosa served me before and delivered with excellence. I am only giving a 4 star today because I felt that the waitress today was very short with me. I came for happy hour and it was 2:20, she said it wasn't 2:30pm yet and walked away. I just stood at the bar waiting with no clue if I could still order food. I am on my lunch break and don't mind paying full price. The owner however came over to ask if I had been helped and I answered "yes, i am waiting to order at 2:30 I think". By the time he asked it was 2:25pm. He went ahead and took my order and i stayed at the bar. The waitress did explain why she didn't take my order. I understood that, I just didn't appreciate the way she went about it. But maybe she was having an off day. My food was ready within 3 minutes and she brought it over. I waited about a minute for my utensils, but she didn't come back. I reached over and grabbed a pair since the were directly to my right and at reach. I will definitely come back and reccoment this place. Today was just odd, hence my four stars.</Review>

Wow. This pizza restaurant is so much more with its family owned status and dedication to sourcing its ingredients (And pizza oven) straight from Napoli. If you are anywhere near Fullerton this is definitely the place you should be if you want to have a great meal from a great family/restaurant.
I found nothing wrong with my meal besides leaving very full, but that is definitely a good thing!

My suggestion is to get the Involtini Ai Sapori. It is prosciutto wrapped around mozzarella and arugula with pesto on the side... Amazing.</Text>

< Review>
Came here on a Friday night for a friends bday gathering about 8pm.  Just the tip.  This place is bussssy at this time, but the staff was so accommodating to our ever growing party of 8-12 people.  The waiter was extremely patient with us and served us always with a smile.

At dinner my friend ordered the Mozzarella bar which consists for 4 types of cheeses to choose from.  In this particular case we ordered a creamy slightly salty Burrata; reminiscent of French Brie and freshly made smoked Bufala on a bed of spicy arugula.  Not only did this plate come with these tasty cheeses, surprisingly it also came pizza size foccacia bread.

This plate was big enough to share with the table, so we decided to get our own 12 inch Affumicata thin crust Napolitean topped with smoked mozzarella, earthy roasted mushrooms, sweet tomato sauce, fresh basil and an extra drizzle of extra virgin olive oil pizza.  Our friend got a beautiful Diavola pizza with long thin strips of spicy salami, specks of crushed red pepper, mozzarella, tomato sauce and freshly picked basil. That thing looked like a piece of art!  Add a bottle of Cab, let the wine flow and we were ready to party hearty!< /Review>

The pizza is perfectly cooked with so much flavor. The caprese salad is very fresh. Now for the desert. If you are a Nutella fan then you are in luck. A must order is the Nutella Calzone. It's not on the menu but they make it. Just ask.<//Text>

I've been here a few times now and I've always been disappointed in some aspect. Its was way expensive for the quality of the food and most of the time the pizza would come out burn or wrong.< /text>

Excellent italian pizza just like in italy. Sadly a lot of people confuse good pizza with domino's, pizza Hut and such.</Review>

Lol

Top dough I was satisfied,
however sauce in my (100% Italiana bred human ) opinion  really lacked flavor!
Sausage was do able for sure !
Prefer to have bottom crust golden brown
I do not like Anything burnt ( blackened)
Im extremely hard to please when it comes to
Pizza.
My Aunt made best pizza ever

(Translated by Google) Authentic Italian style pizza store is here! I feel like I've finally found one in OC. I had Diavola and it tasted so great. Super quick preparation, thin dough, equipped with hand-made oven that enhances sour and deeply fermented taste of dough. Pizza dough is soft and it also smells different. Tomato sauce is also properly salted. Perfect!
Spicy, deep flavor with authentic Italian-style margarita pizza topped with salami. But the dow is very impressive and I think it is special. The taste of aged dough is excellent. I like the authentic Italian pizza, but the tomato sauce is not as crispy.

정통 이탈리아 스타일의 마게리타 피자에 살라미 햄이 올라가니 약간 스파이시하면서도 깊은 맛을 냄. 그런데 도우가 매우 인상적이라 특별하다고 생각됨. 숙성된 도우의 맛이 일품. 정통 이태리식 피자의 느낌이 강한데 토마토 소스가 싱겁지 않아서 좋은듯.< /text>
