I was very impressed with Mark and his team when they cleaned my sofa and brought it back to life!  They showed up on time, did a wonderful job and were very accommodating with their time when I asked them to also clean a couple of additional pieces. I highly recommend them.<//Review>

This company is AMAZING! It was easy to book and they did a great job. Our carpet was destroyed from kids and dogs and I cannot believe how good it looks now. They were friendly, professional and worked hard. It is also very affordable. I highly recommend using them, we will be using them again and wished we did it sooner! Thank you very much Lighting Bolt, we really appreciate it!< /Review>

Mark and his associate were amazing! On time, easy-going, friendly, the guy is amazing. The service was beyond expectations. On time, extremely thorough and fast! Our apartment looks brand new and smells brand new. He even helped me with an office chair and an inflatable bed I had laying around, those got cleaned too and I can’t believe how good they look. There is a reason why this company has great reviews, and here goes another one to them. Will for sure call them up again!< /text>

<text>Greatly appreciate Mark’s quick response to my request for service and their punctuality on date of appointment! Started off on the right foot and ended that way as well! My sectional and oversized chair are looking and feeling so much better! Anyone looking for cleaning services but cannot get someone with truck mounted equipment to get to your second floor apartment/condo, please look no further, their mobile equipment got the job done for fairly accesible pricing! Happy customer!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Mark was so friendly and quick to respond. Our flooring got pretty wet, but the team was quick to dry everything up and make sure it was good before they left. I do wish they had worn little booties inside, as with the wet floor and a multi-person team, we found some dirty track marks inside once the team left.<//Text>

The service was super beyond my expectation because there were other vendors who are selling such services for a higher price like 250$, while this cleaning company only had 180$, and the result was so good! I got grease and dust mixtures on a carpet with one year of usage, but they got it cleaned super well. Strongly recommend this service.</review>

<Text>Lightning Bolt Carpet & Upholstery Cleaning was able to resume cleaning services and I am so happy with the precautions they are taking! Only one cleaner, masks, gloves and social distancing. Adriana is wonderful -- I know it is probably so much harder to be cleaning as one person vs a team of two but she does such a thorough job.</Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Our kids had a little too much fun on our couch...let’s just say if it didn’t get cleaned ASAP it might have been a lost cause.

Glad I found these guys! Needed some chairs cleaned, as well as an outdoor couch and some miscellaneous outdoor cushions. These guys were responsive, gave a competitive, reasonable quote (I got quotes from 3 other vendors), and could be out within a few days. Plus, the cleaning was during COVID-19 lockdown, and Mark wore a mask and was cool about doing the work on our front patio (I moved the chairs out there) and using Venmo for payment so we could maintain social distance. Great experience, and I’ll use them again next time!< /Text>

They were amazing. A full team came right on time. They cleaned our super lived-in sofa. It was a fairly new sofa but extremely dirty from kids and dog. It looks brand new. They even noticed our ottoman was dirty and cleaned that as well and did not charge me for that add on. Great company I know we will use again.< /text>

Mark at Lightning Bolt Carpet cleaning has been great! They have cleaned the carpets at my office twice. They showed up on time, were efficient and always professional. They came highly recommended from a cleaning supply company that I purchase products from and I am definitely going to use them again at my office and at my house.

< Review>
I have two little doggies.  They are the best and I love them.  They love me.  I love them.  But sometimes I have to work late and they become little rebels on my carpets.   A couple of years ago I found out about Lightning Bolt Carpet Cleaning and their pet odor removal service.  Seriously tried all of the home remedies and even rented one of those machines from the grocery store.  Nothing works like the treatment Lightning Bolt Carpet Cleaning does for my place.  Me and the two cutest doggies in the world can now live in peace and harmony.</Review>

Lightning bolt is hands down the best carpet cleaning service I’ve ever used. Mark was awesome and super professional from the initial call all the way through to service and payment. He did an amazing job on our two bedroom apartment and finished the job in only an hour and a half. I thought our golden doodles hair was an unbeatable job but mark killed it and the carpets look brand new. Thanks again mark!!!!!</Review>

I have used Mark's services twice so far and can't be more satisfied. He is very polite and friendly, his quality of works is fantastic, and equally important, he has the fairest rates I have been able to find in the Irvine area. He also is great at returning your call and very flexible with scheduling. I will definitely use him again and highly recommend him.< /Review>

I had Mark last year cleaning my 2 bedroom apartment , and he did an amazing job, very professional, very reasonable price and a very nice guy.
I called him back after a whole year and was surprised that he saved my number with my address, he was so welcoming and work around my available day.
Can't wait to have my carpet breath again.
Highly recommend Mark.< /review>

<text>I found them on Yelp. I "rarely" am steered wrong by Yelp. I contacted Lighting Bolt for a quote which was competitive. I scheduled an appointment for them to do my carpet cleaning. He called about 20 minutes prior to showing up. He showed up on time, did the job and off he went. I think his name was Mark. He was very personable, did his job, chatted a bit, but did not try to become my new BFF, which happens too often. After the drying process was complete the carpets looked good. So I would say that everything went smoothly and I am very satisfied. I would recommend Lightning Bolt.</text>< UserId.>

I had a great experience with Lightning Bolt.  They were easy to communicate with, in regards to scheduling.  I was happy that they were able to even come early on the day that I had them scheduled to clean my carpets in my apartment.  I also like that their equipment is portable, which I believe is not the case for some other companies.  Lastly, the quality of work is great.  The team was efficient and the carpets looked great afterwards.< /Text>

<Review>I received a free carpet cleaning from my landlord who happened to schedule an appointment with these guys. Mark, the technician, did GREAT! He was on time, very polite, and worked very quickly. Only took him a little time to set up and then he started cleaning. Took him just 2 hours to clean 3 bedrooms, a hallway and the stairs. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have their carpet cleaned!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I had a great experience with Lightning Bolt couch cleaning.  I had my couch cleaned less than a year ago, and I'm pretty sure they ripped me off. They only spent about 15 minutes cleaning and said that they were limited on what they can do because of the material my couch was made out of. Mark came and showed me the bucket of water after he cleaned and it was almost black.  He was very professional, I would definitely use them again!<//Review>< Pics>

I had a pleasant experience. I believe a man named mark helped me, sorry I’m bad with names. He answered my phone call one evening and listened to my situation and he told me that he could have it done the first thing in the morning. He ended up coming in on his day off early in the morning and did a fantastic job on our carpet. We have dogs who have basically destroyed the carpet and mark got rid of any evidence of pets. I’ll be coming back in the future if need be</review>

<review>I have intentionally waited over 30 days to write my review about Lightning Bolt Carpet. How often do you get your carpets cleaned and 30 days later all the same spots are back! Well, not this time! It has been almost 45 days since they came to my house and I had some dark ugly spots from my dog and they are all gone and have not returned! 5 Star! Great value for the price. Mark and his crew were awesome.</review>< pics>

We have kids here.  And grand kids.  Lots of them.  The carpets always get food on them as well as pee and poo.  We have had Lightning Bolt Carpet Cleaning out to clean them 3 times in the last year.  The put some kind of enzyme treatment in there to get rid of all the funny stink that goes builds up.  So grateful that I found these guys. Next time I will have them steam clean the couches.  Those things smell like a dog even though we don't have one!<//Text>

I called first thing in the morning, and Mark fit me in the same day.  My rugs were very dirty but the reason I called was because my cat had peed all over them.  Mark and his assistant worked until the rugs were beautifully clean and smelled fresh.  They even found many spots I hadn't realized were soiled.  I would definitely call him again.</Review>

I live in a house with my friends, and the carpet got destroyed our first year living it in. You could definitely tell it was really dirty. No one wanted to walk barefoot on the carpet; it was bad.

When one of our housemates got her carpet room cleaned, she called lightning bolt carpet! The person who came was really nice, and very friendly! We had a dog, and he was very nice about him running around and such. He told us to give him a call if we ever wanted our dining room and living room carpet cleaned, and that's exactly what we did! He remembered the us and the house.

He told us that the carpet may not look brand new, but at the end it was soo clean! Better than what we expected! Definitely going to recommend this company and use them again!< /text>

<review>The only thing I don't like about Lightning Bolt Carpet & Upholstery Cleaning...

I was moving out of my rental house in Irvine, but wasn't familiar with any carpet cleaning services. Yelp seemed to be my answer, so I found a number and gave them a call.

Mark answered my call and set me up for carpet cleaning. He was clear on getting my information and confirmed the time. (You'd be surprised how many people forget to follow up with their clients...)

It was 1PM, but he didn't make it there yet. I was nervous, but a few minutes later, he arrived.

Such a friendly guy and got my carpet cleaned so quickly. He even got the tough stains out. Wish I had the pictures before and after to show you exactly what he did.

Anyway, the only thing I don't like is that he doesn't have more reviews. This guy is legit and has gone above and beyond my experience. Quick, clean, and friendly.

Do yourself a favor -- get Mark to clean your carpet now.</review>< Pics>

Lightning Bolt came out same day to clean my couch after my cat peed on it. They did a fantastic job, didn't charge extra despite the smell and general grossness, and were very friendly. I'll definitely use them again in the future!</text>

<Text>I have a rental property in Orange and the tenants were not supposed to have none of those furry friends.  Well guess what ! I love dogs too but with a bad owner and a rental bad mix.  The doggie let loose on my carpets bomber style and smelled omg.  I called Lightning Bolt Carpet and the results is what I got with clean carpet and pet odor free house. Now there is no smell but a fresh smell. best carpet cleaning in OC Awesome< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcdda133e8c921:0x61da81bc26ace9af</GmapID><Date>1433300688429<//Date>< userid>

<review>I've done somewhere between 15-20 escape rooms around the West Coast, and this is one of the top 2 for "best aesthetic." All the puzzles tie into the theme, even some of the introduction stuff is tied in, which really adds to the fun of the event. There were some REALLY cool surprises I didn't see coming.

And to the puzzles. I believe this is the first escape room these 2 gentlemen have created, and it's really very good for a 1st room. They've done their research, created good puzzles, and are continually tweaking to make the experience flow.  There were some super satisfying puzzles in there, including some puzzles of which I'd never seen the like. The puzzles were varied enough that everybody got a crack at a different type of puzzle.

My main critique, they've already fixed and disclaimed to us when we arrived: We booked our room when the website said 4-6 people, and 6 is far too many for experienced players. We should have come with 4 people. But I believe they've capped it now. So if you've done escape rooms before and have been successful, go with the min number of players.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwW4W_yog7LZIZcW0tW6vurybkY7X0Iqs-6Z4O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMArVR1AVhK-k6shC0zmn6C4GaLbjOVemlsrUDG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808431c7cea84dc3:0x5e3b6e14d6815555< /gmap_id></record>

Galen and Aidan's art and robotics talents have morphed what was a simple office building into an hour-adventure space; immersing the participants in a world that trips you out of Sebastopol instantly!
I participated with some co-workers and highly recommend it as a great team-building endeavor along with being great fun for friends and family.  More Escape Rooms please! :)< /text>

<review>We have played 20-30 escape rooms over the past few years and this was one of the best! The story is creative but not over-complicated and really weaves in seamlessly throughout the game. The puzzles are unique and vary a lot so everyone in our group really had something to contribute and stayed busy the whole time. The creators and owners are extremely pleasant and friendly and make the experience stand out all the more. I will be anxiously awaiting their next room and recommending to friends and family until then!< /review>< time>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>The extraordinary level of detail and craftsmanship, along with a great story, make this the best escape room I've ever been to by far. The entire experience was smoothly run and entertaining, yet still challenging. It was so refreshing to spend a night out doing something new and invigorating with friends, something that gets you thinking and exploring. The founders have a real gift and showcased their fantastic creativity. I will recommend this to everyone I know. 👍👍<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808431c7cea84dc3:0x5e3b6e14d6815555</GmapID></record>

So much fun! This was our first escape room experience and we can't wait to try another one. The story was interesting, the room was so realistic, and there was such a great range of puzzles! The creators have really done something amazing here and we loved the surprises and twists. I highly recommend this place and hope they expand their business with another room!</review>

<Review>I would give this 6 stars if I could. A wonderful puzzle! An interesting setting and story line, great period feel, all the details. Many steps, lots of small triumphs along the way. Challenging but not too frustrating. A not to be missed experience while visiting Sonoma County.< /Review>< Rate>

I don't think I can add much to all of the already-five-star reviews, so I am just adding another voice to say this place was really fun, and done incredibly well.  Family of four, with a 12 and 14 year old, had a super good time.  Everyone got to contribute to finding solutions, nothing was too obvious or un-necessarily hard to figure out, and at least once for everyone they got to be the one who made the discovery that led to solving a puzzle.  I was the only one who had done an escape room before, and we finished by going over by about a minute, for whatever that is worth.  These guys' style was cool, I'd do another room if/when they make it.</Review>

< Review>
So fun! We had such a great time at the Spacetime Travel Agency. We had four of us in our group, all newbies to escape rooms. The orientation was useful to help us approach the room, and give us the back story on the Kronos initiative. We thought all the puzzles were incredibly well thought-out and constructed. Everything tied together really well and maintained the narrative of the story. We fixed the time machine and completed everything with less than a minute to spare!  Highly recommend this experience - you won't be disappointed!</Review>

<review>10/10 Would time travel again.

There were four of us looking to try something cool for a friends birthday. None of us had done an escape room before and this room had a ton of great reviews and it did not disappoint. The owners, Galen and Aiden, were really nice and so cool about keeping with the experience. The puzzles were the perfect amount of challenging and rewarding. With a 40% success rate we finished with 4 minutes and 7 seconds to spare and couldn’t stop reeling about our victory for the rest of the night. Highly recommend!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

10/10 Would totally recommend. We have been all over Sonoma county doing these escape rooms. All old them are great but this is our favorite thus far. Cannot wait to discover more.< /Review>

Really amazing space and escape room. We had a group of 5 adults (many of us hadn't done an escape room before this) and it was awesome! There was an attention to detail in every room that really keeps you in the moment and the puzzles were incredibly satisfying to complete. Highly recommend it!< /Review>

<text>Great room with some puzzle types we hadn't seen before, a good plot, and well-curated experience overall (design, props, features). We had 5 in our group, which definitely made sense as the upper limit. Two in our group were first-timers and the rest of us had done maybe 10 rooms between us but the experience was accessible and fun for everyone. The owners really seemed to care about providing a good experience for all (well-timed hints and no pressure of being literally locked in the room) so if this is your first time doing an escape room, I think this would be a great one to start with. That said, it was challenging enough for the 3 in our group who'd done them before that we finished with only 3 minutes to spare.</text></record>

<Text>My bf and I have done around 100 rooms and this is definitely in our top rooms.  The attention to detail and immersion was spot on,  from the moment you walk into the lobby,  to the bathroom,  to the owners and gm being us.  The puzzles were challenging and fun. I highly recommend this place!</Text><date>1554603791085<//date>< UserId.>

There is a reason this place has a 5 star review.   I went with 3 close friends with no expectations at all.  All 4 of us had never done an escape room before so we had no idea what we were getting into.    Aiden and Gaylen(forgive me if those aren’t correct spelling) are the 2 owner operators and they did just an awesome job through the whole experience.  They were very clear on what to expect and welcomed us noobs.   The room itself was way more detailed than we would have imagined and had so much fun figuring out the puzzles.  We did need a little guidance at times but we managed to get most of the clues by ourselves.    The thought and creativity that went into this place is just mind blowing.   And the details....  Every little thing had something that tied back to the main story. The two brothers offered their praise and feedback after the game and were true gentlemen.

So so so cool.   Wish it made sense to go back and do it again.   But instead I recommend anyone and everyone to do this challenge.< /Text>

<Review>I was really into the backstory of the "Kronos Initiative" at this escape room - it pulled me back into a cold war setting, and made the puzzles seem to serve a larger purpose.

Many of the puzzles were like nothing I had ever seen in an escape room - it was definitely not your typical "escape the jail cell" - and the inventiveness at each stage was delightful.

I would recommend you do this room with a group of 4-6 people - 4 was our sweet spot.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Sonoma County's best kept secret! This is an experience you must not miss. I did this escape room for my 50th bday with 3 friends and then did it again 1 hour later with 4 other friends (didn't give any hints to the 2nd group). It worked out perfect. Went out to dinner after. The owners of this escape room have put together an experience that is amazing. The attention to detail is extraordinary. One last thing...  The owners communicate very well too (when I was planning my day) with emails responded to very quickly. I really appreciate that.<//Text>

This was my boyfriend and I's 5th escape room and my friends 1st time and we all had such a great time. It was one of the best ones we've ever done! Truly one of the most well decorated, beautiful, and immersive games full of surprises and great riddles/puzzles!!  The craftmanship of the room itself was incredible. I cant wait until they can open more escape rooms in the future! Til then, I'll be referring this place to my friends and family looking for something fun to do!<//text>

I've you don't have a lot of automotive knowledge i would not recommend this store. I had to stop in several times this week and got little to no help. Management and their staff were too busy talking shop and making snide remarks about customers who were clearly unaware of what they needed. I asked one of the managers for help looking for a part and he stood there and punched in I don't know what to their system and said he couldn't help me. A quick Google search and their store on Mack rd had the part all in all if you live in this area head to mack rd location they were much more helpful!<//text>

I called auto zone this morning for a battery and the helpful voice Will answered the phone. I came in and Will started to change my battery. Will said, you might have a warranty on this battery! Wait what okay let me call Les Schwab. I did have a warranty. Will put my battery back in my SUV with a big smile. I was smiling ear to ear because Will just saved me a lot of money. Thank God for human kindness of people like Will.<//review>

<Text>Don't get your battery tested here. Took two sperate vehicles of mine here and had them tested. Coincidentally their AutoZone branded machine suggested they sell me an alternator on both scenarios. Side note: I replaced my own alternator and it passes fine on my own multimeter, so you can be sure they're just pushing parts sales. Only one vehicle ACTUALLY had a bad alternator.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1566926301238, 'text': "Hello, we're sorry that you had your car issue misdiagnosed.

<text>I walked in the store no greetings no one at the parts counter. One of a sudden this girl walked up named crystal and the customer had a return and told she cant return even if the refund was for $25. Every time I go in the store she is always sitting on the chair behind the counter and eating something. No customer service. They need to improve. She has to go back for the training to learn the customer service. Other employees are better than her. If other employees can go above and beyond. Customer's usually go to that store to get some help not expecting this kind of service. Abdul,Perry, Rickey, Raj, Vitesh, Dan these people are very helpful when ever I walk in the store. Very professional. They have get that crystal out to other store or she has to go somewhere where she gets to learn the service.

< Review>
I've been here multiple times and it's my go-to place for advice and everything else concerning my vehicles that isn't higher level stuff an auto repair shop must handle. Sometimes slow to get around to you but that's because they take care of each individual customer completely from what I've seen, and I don't mind waiting for the service.
Knowledgeable staff and always trying to save the customer money. fantastic crew works here. top knotch.
I've been to O'Reilly's and other places and only reason I go there now is because Auto Zone doesn't carry the coolant my Mini Coop requires. but I don't buy anything else from the competition, only the coolant. These guys have that kind of loyalty from me. 5 years plus I've been in and out of this particular location on occasion.<//Review>

<review>I had a battery on its last legs. The customer service I received was exceptional!  First we tested the battery, concluded it was the problem. Next the woman helping me lent me all the tools I needed to swap out the battery in the parking lot.

Good pricing, easy access to location, it always seems that their oil container is never full so I can easily dump my used oil here.

Every time I have used this store, and it has been several times since it opened I have left very happy.

Sad this place changed a lot. There is a He staff there that s rude. He even told me you buy air filter and you dont know how to change it. Will I ask him if I did. I love the guy whose name.starts with the R. He was so happy with customers and just replaced my headlight bulbs without me asking for help. I dont see him anymore replaced by rude staff. Now.I.go to Reillys but not the one by mack road. You  autozone by Safeway continue to be rude and you ll go zero customers unless they have no choices or you just pick on people you think you can be rude to.<//Review>

<review>Needed tail light bulbs and harness for my mustang, didn’t have any on the shelf so I asked the older guy with an accent and he tells me they don’t have them without even looking. So I say I need a wiring harness too and he proceeds to get a rude tone and say he just told me they don’t have them without even asking me what vehicle etc. So I said I’ll just go to another store and left without buying anything. Horrible attitude and customer service, will never go to this store again!< /review>< UserId.>

I broke my oil cap on accident. Luckily I called before I went in, the young man who answered told me not to drive my car because oil will get all over engine & may cause more damage. He took down my name, car type & year. When I finally arrived later that night my oil cap was ready to be purchased. Thanks for all your help.< /Review>

Never have I experience such rude service. Abdul was the customer service rep. and he was awful. He couldn't figure out how to get the system to return my product, even though I showed him my email receipt with barcode. Insisted it should take my phone number (not my problem). O'Reilly Auto parts is just down the street. I recommend going there instead.<//Review>

The staff didnt rally seem knowledgeable about vehicles and parts. It seems like they were just there to ring up items and nothing else. On another note the prices at this place is ridiculous. $45 for a 5 quart jug of Mobile 1 motor oil just insane so I went to Walmart instead and picked up the same brand motor oil and oil filter for less than $45. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you absolutely have no other choice< /review>

<Text>This place is a train wreck. It's down the street from my house and I always say the same thing "why do I come back here". The parking is always packed. Only two people that work there know anything about cars the other five might as well be at home. Don't know how many times have they sent me home with the wrong parts. I know if it wasn't right around the corner I would never go there again.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I recently just changed insurance and so needed to assign a PCP. I am very pleased with both Dr. Parrott and PA Kelsey Brangoccio. I feel listened to, not judged, not rushed, and treated respectfully. I hold a high standard as I myself am in the health care field and they certainly met it. This is my new home clinic and I want to keep it that way.</Review>

I love how clean it is every time I go, I love the location because Adams Ave has some great spots to eat and drink. They treat me like family and they don’t look at me weird because I’m covered in tattoos, very professional and super friendly staff. Seems like it’s all females that work here and everyone is beautiful even my Doctor! But they have one staff member that is so sweet and Gorgeous!!!! I almost hope I get sick just so I get to see her.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Horrible experience from the start. That office is a mess. I scheduled an appointment early September, when I show up they were confused and didn’t know why I was there and that I should have had a televisit . On the phone with the person who scheduled me she asked if I preferred to come in the office or do a televisit and I chose to come in since it was my first visit and I wanted to meet my doctor. At first when I showed up they tried to rush me off and said there’s nothing they could do since I showed up on time but with televisits I need to be 30 min early.... i asked since I was there if I could just sign in to do the televisit they said no..I was upset but polite and asked since I was there for my scheduled appointment if they could still see me. The dr approved and I was seen. The staff was short with me and hurried because it was the end of the day appointment due to my work schedule. I’m sorry but if you don’t want 5pm appointments when you close at 6 don’t have them...the only person that made me feel like I was welcome was Dr Kelsey. Thank you for that. She didn’t hurry me and listened to everything and got my past medical history (since this was an establish patient visit) she needed to send out a referral to a specialist which I thought was off because I don’t need one for my insurance..? Anyways. I waited a couple weeks and didn’t hear anything from anyone. I call the office today and they had THE WRONG INSURANCE IN THEIR SYSTEM!!! The staff didn’t want to help when I called to figure out what was going on.  Started getting snooty with me because I was of course frustrated and i had already called my insurance company to verify that I was correct. Everything is as it should be but they couldn’t pull up my insurance information. The guy didn’t want to deal with me anymore so he pushed me to billing. So now I have to deal with fixing their mistake and have wasted time waiting for the insurance to approve my referral. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK. Good thing I found this out on the first visit and didn’t waste too much time. This had to have been the most unwelcoming and frustrating Dr visit I’ve had. No one seemed to know what was going on.<//text>< pictures>

I've had to constantly battle to get the treatment I need (and we're talking about simple things like a test or referral), their focus seems to be getting your copay and appeasing the insurance companies more than your actual care. I haven't switched yet hoping at one point I could find someone here that lives up to all these good reviews but I give up.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I was recently discharged from Scripps Mercy in Hillcrest with very little guidance on how to proceed with my recovery plan. I called Perlman Clinic to schedule an appointment was seen the same day by Brooke Myrberg. She answered all my questions and alleviated my fears. They did a full CBC and I had my results back in less than 24 hours. Knowing that Perlman Clinic is available with such a wonderful team of professionals has helped put my mind at ease. Thank you!< /review>

Great experience! It was super easy to book an appointment same-day. The staff was extremely courteous, and the NP I saw was knowledgeable and kind. Will definitely be using this location's services again in the future (if I need it).< /Text>

I was able to get an appointment with the Doctor I wanted to see within a week of when I made the appointment. The clinic is very nice, and Dr. Taylor was wonderful. She addressed all of my concerns and made me feel so welcome.

I found street parking down one of the side streets very easily, and it's in a really nice location with shops nearby.<//Text>

<text>I just switched over to this group and went there for the first time on Monday and they were seriously AMAZING! It was super easy to get an appointment and I felt really comfortable with all the staff, which is something that I had never experienced with my old doctor's office. I saw Dr. Parrott and she was SUPER nice and attentive. I felt like she actually listened to my concerns, and she gave me options that were catered to my personal preferences. I also appreciate how thoroughly she went through the information with me, which allowed me to make the best decision for myself. The most efficient and welcoming clinic/doctor's office that I have ever been to, hands down!</text>< pictures>

<text>This was my first visit to this clinic.  I was seen the day I asked for the appointment , showed up early to complete the paperwork, and was seen shortly after.  The staff was welcoming and  efficient.  The NP who did my exam took time to talk with me about what was going on and seemed competent to handle my complaint.  I recommend this clinic.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Review>I LOVE this office of the Perlman Clinic Group.  From the ladies up front, the intake nurses, the PA's and especially Dr Taylor, every time I go I feel welcome and my issues are heard.  I've been to three other locations and this is by far my favorite. Easy to get to for me (as the others are difficult in terms of traffic because of where I work and live).< /Review><Time>1565712770316< /Time><Pictures>None</Pictures>< name>

From start to finish, the team was welcoming, professional, and knowledgeable. After putting off a visit to the doctor's office for a little longer than I should, I felt totally at ease with Dr. Pierce and Dr. Taylor. I could not have asked for a better experience!</Text>

I love this clinic! I have been twice for situations in which I needed to see a doctor quickly and my UCSD primary care physician was either closed or couldn't fit me in. Both times, Perlman clinic got me an appointment within 30 minutes. The very best part is that the two doctors I have seen were both amazing, knowledgeable, friendly, and comforting. I feel VERY lucky to have this place close by! Thank you, Perlman staff,  for such great service when I needed it most.< /text>

I like this clinic and Dr Taylor in my couple of visits. However, I had an issue about my phone calls, verbal requests, and emails about medication refills. I kept reminding and leaving messages about the need to refill my medications. One time I missed my insulin dosages for a week before they refilled my insulin and anti-anxiety medication. Last week again my pharmacist in Costco send a refill for my accucheck strips but no response from the clinic. I left a message today about this issue and in the automated greeting it gave the on call doctor phone number. I felt that maybe the on call doc can help me out. When I called her she was obviously upset already by her tone of voice. She talked to me like a child with raised voice. I confronted her about her angry tone. After I explained to her my situation, in not so many words she stated I am not an emergency and she is only handling emergency cases. I am a nurse and a diabetic who is asking for a refill of my nano accucheck strips. I have not checked my blood sugar for one week now and been waiting for a refill prescription from this center. So I am giving them one last time to fess up this mess and I will definitely report these inefficiency and change my clinic. Thank you for your time in reading my comments.<//Review>

I couldn't say enough about the Perlman clinic. It truly is so rare to find such dedicated and caring physicians not to mention the front office staff. They are always accommodating to my schedule and really wen my the extra mile to help make sure to get me in when they were completely booked. Thanks to all. Definitely recommend and encourage this clinic!!</review>

My wife highly recommended this clinic that I also recommend. I was able to schedule a same day appointment with a listening and insightful doctor will takes a sincere interest in my health and practical options. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. I look forward to working with them on my health goals.</Text>

<text>These guys are excellent!! I cut my hand and needed a few stitches. It was late Friday afternoon, New Years weekend and they were slammed! A regular emergency room or urgent care center would have undoubtedly been a wait for hours, but I was in and out with a stitched hand in about an hour. Great service, very friendly, and billed my insurance, no problem. These guys, from the Doc down to the receptionist, know how to get it done!< /text><gmap_id>0x80d954499d4f5a31:0xe1acf0681b207778</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I'd really like to give it a minus 10, but 1 star is the lowest option. When I made the appointment to see Dr. Rogers, there was no mention of needing a referral. Even though the office staff was able to secure a referral on the spot, Dr. Rogers still refused to see me. Refused! She didn't even have the courtesy to come out and talk to me - she relied on her assistant to carry messages back and forth.

Days later I found out the office staff had made a follow up appointment for me without my permission and without letting me know. I'll bet they would have charged me a no-show fee when I didn't come in.

While I was in the waiting room, another patient came in without an appointment (there's a sign in the window that welcomes walk-ins). She was told there would be at least a 2 hour wait and she should go to the Hillcrest clinic instead. But I was the only one in the waiting room. She might have had to wait about 15 minutes since the doctor refused to see me anyway!

I suggest if you need medical care - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!</Text>

I've had a couple great experiences here. The staff is so friendly and the doctors take the time to really listen and ask lots of questions. It makes a big difference to have a doctor's office you can trust!< /Text>

<review>Amazing would be an understatement. Dr. Taylor and the whole staff (Jordan, Veronica and Jessica (?) )were very helpful. I strongly advise anyone and everyone to visit them. Very clean site, professionals to top it off!!!<//review>< date>

After reading the positive reviews I have to wonder who was on staff the day I went in. Yesterday, 1/2, my daughter drove me over in the morning. There was one person in the waiting room. I was so sick I was reluctant to go anywhere and expose others. When the young woman finally left the hall to come to the desk she gave me the third degree, paperwork and to come back at 4. All very cool. Really?Walk-ins welcome. Did not and will not return though I too thought having handy medical services would be a plus.</Text>

Good care in the clinic, but the office wouldn't send me my X-rays to take to a specialist. Lame.

More specifically, they said they would, then they didn't.… Which is even worse.

Friendly staff. Easy scheduling. ...I've seen them deal with horrible, rude customers far better than the entitled jerks deserved.

No problems with my second visit.

I'll bump this up a star if all goes well on my third visit, which I hope is a long time from now!<//text>

Very nice and modern office. The staff is VERY especially Antonia who helped out with some insurance issues of mine. Also, Dr. Taylor is so kind and listened to any of my issues/questions and actually seemed like she cared. New patient turned into a repeat patient 😁</review>

We were walk-ins to just check the place out and now we are clients.  Our experience was quick, pleasant and informative.  Just a short walk to the doctors is a blessing.   Check them out if you have any need for a MD.</text>

Walk-in on a Monday morning and waited over 2 1/2 hours. They told me it would be one hour. Nothing against the staff as people, they tried to be helpful but seriously, tell me an honest estimate of the wait next time. That way I can make the decision on my own to stay or leave rather than have the time drag on endlessly. Haven't had a bad experience at a Perlman clinic until now.<//text>

<review>I got an OK from my HMO and my
GP to go to urgent care and when I showed up, urgent care called my doctor for a referral, which my dr's office was expecting. They refused me because I had a dr I didn't want to see, and they told me I'd have to change doctors to be seen. That I neeed to call my HMO and change right then and there, or pay cash. I have 3 ins companies. It did not make sense to me so I quietly left and had to deal with my problem until I could reach my Doctor. Not only was I sick, but totally confused. Not good, I think the girls were not experienced enough to do their job, or they didn't understand what was going on. Called my HMO and they said it was ridiculous and to go somewhere else next time. I Will!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Needed a new Dr after moving and changing insurance. The Perlman Clinic staff and Dr Brangaccio have been great. Listing and helpful. Great to be able to book appointments online, review notes, etc. On time, easy to deal with. Very Happy with my move here.< /text>

Oceanworks is an awesome place to get your car serviced! They're an affordable and honest local mechanic shop. Definitely call or book an appointment online because they can get real busy. If you're on a time crunch, let them know when you're booking the appointment so they'll try their best to accommodate. It's pretty much a one stop shop since they have good connections with the tire shop next door. If you're in the market for a new mechanics shop, definitely give them a call!</Review>

This was my first time at Oceanworks! I was very pleased with them, every step of the way. Easy scheduling online, friendly staff, on-time completion of the work, excellent communication, reasonable pricing. I'll definitely be taking my new car here from now on!<//Review>

<Review>I got 4 bids for servicing my 2004 Toyota Highlander's transfer case. Their bid was competitive and Brian at Oceanworks was very professional. He explained everything at the right level of detail and gave different options along with his recommendations. The Highlander is driving great and I am very happy with my choice.</Review>< Date>

Oceanworks 2 gained my total trust during the many years they took care of my cars. They never overpromised, over charged or recommended anything that was not needed. Chris, the manager is very knowledgeable and involved in both the office and the shop. He always takes time to explain what needs to be done and why.</text>

<Review>I have been going to Oceanworks since before 2000. Angus, Natalie and crew kept my 1997 Acura TL going for more than 260,000 miles and 20 years. It was by far, my favorite car! (The person I sold it to says it runs remarkably well and is still driving it . )

Brian is now the new owner and I just had my 2007 TL serviced at Oceanworks. He and his team, comprised of Billy and Rich (superstar mechanic) had to do a major service to it and the car runs like it's brand new.

I'll miss Angus, Natalie and Mikey, but I am happy that Oceanworks has found a new crew that will allow me to drive my 2007 to 2027.

Thank you, Brian and team, for maintaining the quality of service I've come to expect and appreciate at Oceanworks!</Review><rating>5<//rating>< user>

I called at about 2:45pm and Brian called me Right back. I explained my problem to him and he told me to bring my car in. Within an hr the problem was fixed. He was very nice and efficient when having his staff fix my car. I have found my new car repair shop. Prices were reasonable and location was very accessible.</review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>They do good work but have become so expensive. While I had the car in repair for another issue I thought I'd ask them to change the headlight. This is a 5-minute job that I've done before but thought it would be easier for the pros. It was literally $114 to change a light bulb, labor only. Not even counting the $15 for the bulb. When I asked them they were unwilling to amend the price.</Text><gmap_id>0x80857ef2dd695661:0x3136f4de94e4519< /gmap_id>< userid>

Oceanworks is the place you can trust with your vehicle. My partner wouldn't let me buy a vehicle that they don't service. I had my pre purchase inspections done by them. They were very thorough with the inspections and honest about the condition of the cars.

I brought my Forester in for an oil change and they had me out in just one hour<//review>

<review>Super. Brian has continued a tradition of excellent service and commitment to quality. He worked within the confines of some insurance mistakes we had made and his staff took care of everything on our car in time for us to leave town.

< review>
I took my car here twice, first time to repair brakes there were rusted up from the decade of winters and seasons in Chicago. Job well done. This last time was another thing entirely, since it was a story of revival, or more aptly in October, resurrection.

Basically, some components of the engine assembly were rusted and worn out and failing. Car was dead. Won't start. It happens. Some of them were overdue for inspection and replacement, my bad. It required only a few parts to replace and tune up for the fix.

I took it another place I shall not name down the street where I was told the engine is "dead, it won't turn. It is an older engine and not a very common car thus is $3k plus labor it would be $4k total. or. we can buy it for $200." Dead. Silence. I knew something was up, had it towed here to get it checked out, professionally, and so glad I did.

The engine does turn now. Turns out is was mainly the A/C compressor being frozen, not allowing the engine to turn over. Also, the acc belt tensioner assy. Either way, whatever it was, they did it, worked fast, and accommodated the tow truck, ordering parts to ship is to the shop and constant communication throughout the entire experience.

Highly recommend Oceanworks for any auto, mechanical, electrical, tuning up, whatever your needs are, this is the auto shop!<//review>

<review>I had a pre-purchase inspection done at Oceanworks. The mechanic provided thorough notes and went over all the important findings with me. They provided a strong NO BUY assessment, which was exactly what I needed to steer me away from buying a bad first car. My only criticism is that they should be a bit more realistic with scheduling times, as they told me they were available for a 9am appointment, but did not start working on the car until 12pm. Otherwise a great experience and I would return!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80857ef2dd695661:0x3136f4de94e4519<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have been it the auto repair business for over 40 years and I know what customer service is. Oceanworks II is top notch and highly recommended for your automotive needs. You have my business and will gladly recommend your shop to anyone looking for a great place to get their car serviced or repaired.

I've been going to Ocean Works II for several years now as they were recommended by a friend. They are kind,   respectful and very knowledgeable. They're always willing to make time for me no matter what the issue. They will take five minutes to listen to a noise for me. They will also spend a week getting my favorite truck back on track and make me the happiest lady in town! Their prices are very reasonable for the Bay Area. They never leave me confused. In fact my last visit there they were honest enough to tell me that I probably shouldn't do the work that I wanted done as there were unfortunately other issues with the car that were major. So it's time to let this one go. I felt it honorable of them to say no to work to benefit me. I'll be back!!!< /review>

<review>Oceanworks 2 is the real deal! I’ve been going there for over 10 years and went to Oceanworks before that. I can always count on them to be transparent, and give me the best deal possible, not to mention the quality work done right every time! Chris has always been helpful and gets me in and out and back in the road same day usually. I can’t recommend them enough! You won’t be disappointed!<//review>< GmapID>

You will not find any repair shop that provides better service than Oceanworks. They're highly competent; detail-oriented (their Honda guy made note of several things I should pay attention to that the dealer never mentioned); honest (they never try to push you to do any extra work and they always help you prioritize within your budget if that's what you need); and their attitude toward service and their customers is beyond anything I've ever experienced anywhere else. I adore them and I will never take my car anywhere else. (When I had a domestic, I took it next door to Oceanworks II, so I've been hooked on them for years.)< /review>

I have brought 3 different vehicles to Oceanworks  for many years and have always been completely satisfied with the attentive service, reasonable costs, and helpful explanations and recommendations.  I'm getting old and, essentially, simply ask that Oceanworks do whatever is necessary to keep me safe and sound.  I trust them completely and get a lot of love.  I recommend them highly.<//review>

<review>Google should create a zero stars option for these guys.  Stay clear!  They'll buy from you, try to return the product years later, and then become a thorn in your side.  Angus and Buffy, trust me you don't want their money!<//review>< GmapID>

They do great work and are trustworthy.
It's the only shop I'll go to now.
I've had them replace a transmission as well as other lesser tasks. Chris is the manager and he's a good guy!< /text>

I always feel that I have been treated fairly by Chris. He always checks in and tells us what will be needed before proceeding with the work. The crew is also friendly. They are fast and efficient .. we dropped the car in the morning and picked it up the same afternoon !< /text>

Chris at Oceanworks went above and beyond to help me. I couldn’t have gotten better service ANYWHERE!!
I had a very difficult issue and he was tenacious in his resolve to fix it for me and to get me back on the road.
I cannot say enough good about Chris at Oceanworks!!!< /Review>

So, I have been praying and asking God to lead me to a honest, reputable, company that won't take advantage of me and tell me that I need something done on my car when I really don't. As a side note, the last repair shop that I took my car to, got $1,000 out of me in the course of one month, for 3 different repairs that I later found out that they more than likely caused the issued to appear, as if I needed to have those repairs done! Long story short, God answered my prayer! And from the moment I walked in the door and was greeted by Chris with a very calming, pleasant, and welcoming demeanor, I really felt that I could trust him and OCEANWORKS 2. It turned out to be an awesome experience! They did not know the noises that I was hearing in my car, but when he called me to tell me about what they found he said that they located 4 possible culprits that could have caused the issue that I brought it in for. And the main culprit was a very loose screw. They tigtighte the screw, the noise went away, and I only had to pay for a half hour labor, which was the time it took them to look over the four possible culprits to my issue! They have WON A CLIENT FOR LIFE!!!!!!!<//Text>< pics>

I have a Town and Country minivan purchased from Michael Steads Chrysler and Jeep dealership in Richmond. When the battery was replaced the radio,cd player and back up camera stopped working . I went to the dealership for help. They checked the fuses and they were okay. They told me the entire system needed to be replaced because AAA did something wrong during the battery change. The part was around $1200 plus labor. I was shocked and I couldn't possibly afford it. I asked a number of auto repair people if they had ever heard of this and no one had. At the advice of Bill at Mobility Systems I went to Oceanworks II .Chris spent time researching solutions and hour later he simply removed the battery and installed it again.PROBLEM SOLVED! Chris was so kind and so helpful and I left with an enormous smile on my face. The people at Oceanworks II are awesome and ethical, something I can't say about Michael Stead's dealership.<//Review>

<text>I have been taking my cars to Oceanworks since 1996 and love them. The last time I shopped for a car, I wouldn't even consider ones that I couldn't take to Oceanworks. The first time I had them work on my car the charge was less than what their quote was because it needed less work than anticipated. Over the years they have seen me through bouts of unemployment and given me the options of the cheap way or the suggested way to take care of things with info on the risks involved. Whenever I have needed something in regards to my car that they don't handle, they have recommendations for independent shops that are trustworthy. Angus and Natalie man the front desk and provide fabulous customer service.

I intend to continue to have Oceanworks as my mechanic until I no longer have cars or I move far enough away that I can't get to them any more.< /text>< Rating>

I just had them do the timing belt service ($1400 with tensioner, acc belts, water pump, cam seals, oil change) on my 100k, 2004 Taco and everything seems great.  I like the vibe of the shop... Angus and Natalie are fun to talk to and are a wealth of knowledge about all things Toyota.  This is a place where it feels like you get what you pay for... and you will certainly pay for it... NOT cheap, but there is QUALITY to this establishment.  I brought my wife's FJ Cruiser in for a transmission flush and Natalie quoted my $60 for the service, but she didn't realize it was a "maintenance free" transmission which is more involved to flush.  Normally that would be a $90 service, but she honored the $60 quote and just warned me that it would be more next time.  This will be my go-to shop for large repairs in the future, so I will keep the review updated.</text>< pictures>

I thouht its ok at the first time... I realized it second time... I dropped my car for brakes... he said it would cost $140 - $150 for new brakes with labor....  So I dropped off... Later when I called he gave me a price of $280, and said that the rotors have to be resurfaced and it would cost $120. Generally when you replace brakes, rotors have to be resurfaced and they need to quote you with that price. I have already got a quote of $180 for the complete thing. I think you can buy new rotors at the price he is charging for resurfacing.< /Review>< Pics>

My go to place for crystals.
Great selection and friendly service.
The prices are very reasonable.
I incorporate binural sound therapy with meditation along with the crystals I purchase from NSL.

I just visit this store today.
I love the service and the variety of good quality item they have, the price very reasonable. The parking very accessible.
I'm definitely going back here even is a little far from my house. 😊😊😊😊
Good bless everyone!</Review>

<review>Used to be the best place I knew to buy crystals, now the manager or owner seems to be more about selling than helping people find the perfect crystals. Seems like maybe he has strayed from his path. Several encounters left me searching for a new place. He told me he was the only place still left, which is completely untrue. Then a conversation with the younger guy was rudely cut short when I asked a question. Decent prices, not the cheapest in town but certainly no where near the most expensive. Good sized stones can be found. But despite having a large section in store room, a request for certain size and shape resulted in he won’t look and I could only have what was on the show room floor. Tries to upsell. Pitched how I should buy one of his dragon items because I happened to be wearing a dragon shirt. Felt like an insult, like I was some sort of fan boy that would be swayed to buying something at his mere mention of it. Certainly not practicing the laws of attraction if you ask me. just not the vibe it used to be. But still a great place to get good crystals at reasonable prices. And I keep going back and will continue to do so hoping thing will get better there.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
It was unfortunate to find out that the Store Owner does not believe in the metaphysical or the workings of the crystals, rather he runs the store because he knows it creates a great profit especially because we are in LA county. He also closed off the Crystal Room to only allow those who make a purchase because he found that people only went inside for healing and did not purchase anything in that separate room. Also found out that while yes a good majority of the crystals are real... there are some that are fake. Taking my business elsewhere now, it doesn't matter if I have to drive all the way to LA for completely legitimate crystals, I will no longer shop here.< /Review>

I called to inquire about a certain product. The guy answers the phone and says hold on. Then hangs up on me. I try calling back and they just keep lifting the phone and hanging up. So after 50 attempts the guy decides to answer the phone again then tells me..sorry we don't have it. Now if that isn't rude customer service..then i don't know what is. Very u professional<//Text>

This is a great shop if you are looking for gemstone jewelry, salt rocks, incense, crystals, loose stones, and smudging supplies. They also have a small library of books with subjects like spirituality or smudging. I like to get my supplies of loose stones and gemstone beads. I also usually find a gift or two for friends whenever I come here. I enjoy this shop for the supplies and the customer service. I'm always delighted whenever I leave.</review>

There is parking behind the shop so you don't have to pay for the meter. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area! A lot of their stones are just $2!< /review>

Great selection of stones, bracelets and jewelry and friendly, knowledgeable staff that can answer your questions about anything in the store. I visit regularly to add to my collection and will continue to collect my stones here. Can get really crowded on the weekends also<//review>

Everything in the store is absolutely beautiful!! It's all Authentic Native Made items, the owner and sales people are so helpful, and sweet, and welcoming! It's awesome to have a place to go that has Native Items knows The Native Traditions and is Native Owned for us Natives in the Valley!!!! I love you guys~ Grey Wolf, Chasing Rainbows, and Deborah!!!</Review>

This is my new fav place in LA! Incredible selection, great prices and the staff is so knowledgeable and helpful! I did bday present shopping for friends and family and the staff wrapped my presents beautifully and really took the time to help me pick out what I was looking for. Nothing but good vibes here! Thank you!!!< /review>

<Review>My boyfriend was profiled by White Wolfs wife following him around the store and making us feel incredibly uncomfortable.

I didn't think there would be racism here but I was wrong. I'm not going to recommend this place that was so special to me years ago.<//Review>< pics>

There are either from a mother who doesn't know how to care for her children and let them run around in a store, an illustrated ignorant on gems/semi-prescious stones or new age hipster's who try to make this a new trend.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Really enjoyed this store ....first off I read bad reveiws about racist employees following people around the store...but when i was there today a saw people of differnt races getting along great...second thing negative i read in the reviews was that they were unfair with their prices...i am cheap and picky...and shop around alot....the prices were great....any store  of any kind has things that are priced right and some marked too high...i made out like a bandit and found awesome deals....i know my **** and didnt buy the few things i knew i could aqquire elsewhere cheaper...its not the owners fault if you dont do your homework..
.last thing was that someone said that the overcharged at checkout....this did not happen to me ...i checked ...also someone said they lied about how to use certain tools...or gave incorrect info...yet today when i had a question about dyed stones the were honest and said yes a few in the dicount box were dyed...and also when i had questions they didnt know the answers to...they just said they honestly didnt know...and i appreciated that...i had a few things i was looking for and they didnt carry ....i came in anyways to have a look and was suprised how much i loved the store...also beautiful flutes on the back wall...i wish i would have got one...may have to come back...thanks<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1532794380621, 'text': 'Thank you 🙏'}<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c29e8f647ebef5:0x4196e03dfe11ac82<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

High quality asada , al pastor and produce. Can’t go wrong with Reyna Market. If you want to help a mom and pop shop that’s been serving the Santa Ana community for 10 plus years then this is the place for you ! Shop local and pour your money back into the community ✊🏾<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The food is delicious but in these times of pandemic they have no security all the people grab the bread tongs there were too many people being that a closed place should have limits people too close since it is a small place if the employees are friendly and bring covers mouths and gloves BUT TELL ME WHAT IS THE IDEA OF CHARGING WITH THEM AND THEN GO TO ACCESS THE BREAD WITH THE SAME GLOVES THAT I TOUCH THE MONEY LAST 15 minutes waiting
And everything is As normal as if nothing happened MOST OF THOSE WHO GO HERE ARE ADULTS PLEASE LET'S TAKE AWARENESS OF THE BEST COVID TO SOME DO NOT LIKE SO MUCH BUT TO OTHERS IT CAN BE FATAL LET US BE AWARE LET'S RESPECT LET'S TEACH EDUACTION AND MANAGE THE OWNER NOTHING IS GOING TO GIVE THEM GLOVES IF THEY DO NOT CHANGE THEM IF THEY TOUCH MONEY AND THEN TOUCH THE BREAD

(Original)
La comida es deliciosa pero en estos tiempos de pandemia no tienen ninguna seguridad toda la gente agarra las pinzas del pan había demasiada gente siendo que un lugar cerrado debería tener límites la gente demasiado cercas puesto que es un lugar chico si los empleados son amables y traen cubre bocas y guantes PERO DÍGAME CUAL ES LA IDEA DE COBRAR CON LOS MISMOS Y LUEGO IR A ACOMODAR EL PAN CON LOS MISMOS GUANTES QUE TOCO EL DINERO DURE 15 minutos esperando
Y todo es Tan normal como si nada pasara LA MAYORÍA DE LOS QUE VAN AQUÍ SON ADULTOS POR FAVOR TOMEMOS CONCIENCIA A LO MEJOR COVID A ALGUNOS NO LES DE TANTO PERO A OTROS PUEDE SER FATAL SEAMOS CONCIENTES RESPETEMOS ENSEŃEMOS LA EDUACASION Y AL DUEŃO Y GERENTE DE NADA TE SIRVE DARLES GUANTES SI ELLOS NO LOS CAMBIAN SI ELLOS TOCAN DINERO Y LUEGO TOCAN EL PAN<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Low price, HONEST OWNER, Service was awesome. Did an alignment and could not believe the results .....car drives straight as an arrow now. Seriously, I live in Yorba Linda and I would definitely drive down here again to get auto repairs done. They don't try to sell extra service to you, they advise you what to look for and how to maintain. What mechanics do that??? AAA+++ Service AAA+++ Prices AAA+++ Experience!!! Look at the pictures! This owner even gives back by sponsoring school sports and activities. A VERY GOOD GUY! I wish him the best for him and his business!! Thanks! James P.< /review>

<Text>If you’re tired of paying outrageous car repair bills from a dealership or worried about being swindled into repairs your car doesn’t need, then look no further. Having myself been a victim of both crimes in the past, car repair and maintenance is nothing more than a four letter word in my dictionary. So when I started looking for a shop that could work on a variety of models, everything led to Langston!  Who’s Langston?  Langston is the owner/operator of the shop. Don’t let the name, Anaheim Auto Repair & Muffler Care fool you. They do it all. From a simple oil change to rebuilding an engine, they are a one stop shop who get the job done timely, effectively, and at a fair price.< /Text>< Pics>

Being efficient, fast, trustworthy, customer friendly with integrity, Anaheim Auto Repair and Muffler Care is the place for me to bring my family's cars and mine to get the services.

I'm a dodo when it comes to cars. I had called mechanics around my area and many of them we're rude and expected me to know everything about my car. I called this place and the man who answered was absolutely friendly and understood my situation. Their prices are affordable and I was really content with a service and leniency that they provide! Definitely bring your car here.< /review>

<text>I called every high rated shop around Anaheim as I'm fairly new to the area, to replace my timing chain on my Cadillac and all of them said the same thing "We don't do that here to much work"  and local GM Dealer ship wanted 5,000 dollars to do the job, luckily found Anaheim Auto Repair and Muffler care, and Langston immediately told me he would do it for 1400 and it would take 2 days... I ordered parts two weeks before the date we set to fix it, and I dropped it off to him on a Tuesday after missing my set date on Monday, he had had no problem with it and took my keys , and he ended up calling me back  in a ONE DAY for me to come and pick up my car, Very professional! He showed me my old parts, and my car was running so much better than before! they fixed it and I was able to pass my smog test, and register my car on time! Thank you so much guys at Anaheim auto repair and muffler care! continue the honest customer service I experience with you your team! I recommend this auto shop to anyone!</text>< name>

Been here a few times after the Toyota dealership in garden Grove decided to rip me off on the care of my 4 runner. I can not say enough about the great services Anaheim auto repair provides. Usually get in and out within a hour for an oil change . Anaheim Auto repair was opened on a Vietnamese holiday because he cares that some of his customers are not Vietnamese and still need car care.. Great job for our community!<//text>

I loved this place because of the services and quality of products it provides. I been to this location probably for over 2 years and I can honestly say it an honest business and they will give you a fare price. I would not trust anywhere else even it cheaper because of quality services of this place.</text>

<Response>None</Response><Review>Langston and his crew provide the best service by far. The man truly earns his money, straight forward, and cares for your needs.

I have brought my vehicle in for oil changes, Langston is very attentive of customers and quickly receives you and does the job with efficiency.

I recently checked in for a vehicle repair, I believed my vehicle needed new brakes and new joint axle. Langston then informs me that there is a major issue with my transfer case which was causing the noise I so thought it was from the wheels brakes. This only happens to AWD (all wheel drive) vehicles. The repair was much higher than anticipated but nonetheless very important to attend.
Langston provided a 1 year warranty after the repair, I am very satisfied with my business done at Anaheim Auto Repair Muffler Care shop.

100% Recommend anyone to come get a quote at the very least. Overall excellent.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>5</rate><Time>1520686008679</Time>< Name>

I wish i could give more than five stars for this auto shop!
When i first moved to California from Arizona, someone rear ended me and took off. When i tried to fix my car all the other shops told me that i have to fix unnecessary things and gave me a high quote. But Anaheim Auto Repair gave me a reasonable quote + explain to me why i need to fix certain things that were broken from the accident.

Ever since then I’ve been coming here for oil change, battery change, brake change, and for tires too!

They always treat me like family and take very good care of my car!

Thank you Mr.Langston for always taking care of my 😊< /review>

Not going to come back here again. Long ago prices were fair and service was nice. Lately though, the guy behind the counter who has a lot of hair like a darker looking Jackie Chan, always seems to upcharge certain deals. He smiles a lot and tries to make you feel comfortable but the prices he quotes, he gets a percentage of. He's a salesman behind the counter. Be careful. They have already made damages to my car just driving up the ramp and that's when I told myself, no more.</Review>

Tall but small building makes it easy to navigate. No more wondering around looking for your Dr's office. Ample parking space and of course they have valet parking. BTW, parking is free during the pandemic so if you're running late don't worry about having the funds ready 👍🏻</review>

What I don't like is that they want you to pay for parking. When I went the other day I parked a half-mile away in the neighbouring housing tract. It's a relatively new location for my cardiologist so I suppose they will strike up a validation deal in the near future. Even so I don't think that paying for parking in medical buildings is conscientious at all.< /Text><time>1580423622827</time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rate>

I switched doctors years ago just because I was so annoyed they started charging for parking. Had a new appt with a new doc and didn’t realize this was the place.
We all know it’s bs you are charging at all. You lot suck.</review>

<review>I went to Stine Chiropractic because of pain in my upper leg and hip area after a fall.  The staff was so friendly and helpful!  Dr. Cruz measured me and said I was out of alignment.  He adjusted me and rechecked to make sure I remained aligned.  I feel so much better!  To top it off, they took Kaiser insurance!!!!
I would recommend Stine Chiropractic!< /review>< Rating>

I was anxious about my first visit with this new office but was pleasantly surprised with both doctors. Dr. Stine is very good at what he does and very comfortable. Thank you. We thank Dr. Hoffman for his recommendation.< /text>

<Review>I’ve been a patient here for a little over 2 years and have always had a positive experience. Dr. Cruz takes his time to listen to your complaints and more. Great bedside manners, you don’t  feel rushed. Getting adjustments have definitely helped me with back pain. The staff is friendly and courteous.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Dr. Stine’s office has made such a large impact on my life. I’ve been dealing with reoccurring back issues due to an injury in the gym, and I was incredibly nervous to go to the chiropractors for the first time to try and solve the issue. Both Dr. Stine and Dr. Cruz have provided an incredible amount of help in helping me heal these injuries. I know that when I go into the office for an adjustment, the kind and helpful staff will welcome me and help me with any questions that I have as well.

Please, see this office for any and all chiropractic and rehabilitation needs.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1582754010515, 'text': 'Nick, we really appreciate you taking the time to leave such a well spoken and thoughtful review!

<text>Dr. Cruz at Stine Chiropractic has literally given me my life back! Unfortunately,  in November of 2018 I was in a terrible accident that left me with a broken shoulder, ribs, hip and tail bone. I went through physical therapy but couldn't quite get back to the point where I could hike, bike or even enjoy being in a car for over an hour. Life was hard every day and slowly depression set in.
A friend recently mentioned the benefits of seeing a chiropractor and although I had a bad experience in the past I was determined to find some relief and started researching Chiropractors in my area and Stine had amazing personal experiences and reviews.
I showed up to my first appointment nervous and uncertain if I made the right decision but within minutes of speaking to Dr. Cruz I truly felt comfortable and in good hands. Now I know everyone's results vary but I instantly felt better after my first adjustment and my entire family couldn't believe how much I was able to do. I started exercising immediately and I'm now able to ride my bike 4 miles a day without any pain and I've only had 3 appointments so far!
The entire staff at Stine has been great and I am so grateful for the relief and care I've received from Stine Chiropractic.</text>< Pics>

Dr. Stine clearly explained to me my treatment options and what were the benefits and negatives of each. Decided to go conservative and start chiropractic treatment with him. He is extremely educated and friendly. I am feeling like myself again and owe it to Dr. Stine.

Just recently started going to Dr. Stine, and he has done a great job getting me back into alignment, the pain is gone!  He has a great patient/doctor rapport and listens to the patient, even the little concerns. His staff is courteous, and the time that I had to wait for treatment has been minimal.  Thank you!< /Review>

Love Dr. Stine because he is the best chiropractor in this whole high desert and Barstow. He's gentle and he really knows what he's doing to make you feel better. And soon he's going to have a new office in Barstow that's even bigger than the one he's in over there! If you want to get moving and feel like a new person go see him.< /Text>

Doctor Stine is one of the most proffesional doctors I have been to. I have seen him for a few months, and his staff is wonderful. I like the fact that I get a small town feel from him, and his staff everytime I visit. They really do care about how you feel, and not what is in your wallet. He is very personable, and really is the rule for how all doctors should be. I would absolutely recommend seeing Doctor Stine in the Barstow office to anyone, and everyone. Very affordable, and very worth it.< /text>

Recently moved to Barstow and my neighbor said she tried a new Chiropractor in town, who has another office in Victorville. In Victorville, he was voted Best of The Desert she said, I can see why. No high pressure sales, no 3 times a week for the rest of your life like another Chiropractor I went to in Victorville. I had been to the one of the other Chiropractors in Barstow, but they just adjusted me because therapy cost extra.  Dr. Stine included it at no charge and the adjustment was amazing. I felt better after one treatment.  He told me as long as the pain went away, I didn't need to come back, but that it might take me just a couple visits to totally get rid of it.  It took a total of 4 visits and I'm pain free. Thank you Dr. Stine for caring and for not being about the money.  I can tell he cares for his patients.  You will not be disappointed if you go to Dr. Stine.<//text>

The first time a doctor who won't give you the run around. He is straight foward with you about your care. Try him out for your self. And you will always see the doctor on all visits..</review>

Server was awesome.  Food.. need to get a really first class chef.  There were 8 of us.  3 were really disappointed with their dinner.  This place could be a real gold mine.  Drinks were good.. does not replace a fantastic meal..
Sorry 😞 I didn't like the Fettuccine...  Mary</Text>

Excellent outside dining on the lake, watching ospreys and swallows. Everyone was ordering the lumpia and the Asian lettuce wraps were great too. Very friendly staff, thanks Adam.</review>

<Review>Food was pretty good, drinks were yummy. Just know on warm days the bugs can be a bit much and the smell of the lake can be a little over powering lol Other than that the people were friendly and it was a nice spot<//Review>< Rating>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Now the out side needs a little fixing but dont let that make your choice for you. The owner is really awesome and friendly. So is the guy who got our order. This places has great food and prices. The inside is nice and has a great view of the water front. You can eat outside by the water. I highly recommend this place. I will be going back.< /review>< Pictures>

This spot is the one I like best. I visit plenty of restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The team is very amicable and the cuisine they offer is so tasty. I am always happy to have a nice meal in this place. Highly recommended.</Text>

< review>
Last night we ordered take out from the Boathouse. We were not disappointed in the least. We have eaten here several times in the past few years. The person taking my order over the phone was very nice; told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes. I was just on my way out the door and received a phone call from a very sweet young lady telling me my order was ready. We arrived and I was met at the door; due to curb side service only. Very courteous interaction and I was thanked for supporting the business. I had ordered lumpia as a starter and fish and chips. The food was well prepared and delicious. Fish and chips can be difficult to prepare; these were great and the lumpia was a treat!  Kudos to the new owners/managers of the Boathouse Restaurant👍</review>

<Text>This little hide away is a perfect pit stop for a great lunch a cocktail and a beautiful view of clearlake .. The outdoor patio is a nice place.to take in the views of the lake while you wait for your meal . It was dine out side only due to the corona virus but we had no complaints . The server was extremely friendly and accommodating , the food was very good and the view was beautiful....</Text><Gmap_id>0x8083e84859f93f01:0x240c8f59b149de94< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

<Review>Nice vibe, they have a marina and locals pull up for a.meal and drinks. Outdoor dining right now but lots of tables. Amazing menu with things like lumpia, adobo, and other surprises. Had the steamers and garlic bread yummy! Very reasonable prices. Good service too. Stays open til 9 on weekends but open for lunch and dinner only. Have to buy food or appetizer to drink. Liked that .<//Review></record>

A great place to socialize and meet the local people.  Very warm, friendly and efficient staff.  Amazing outdoor beauty with the lake right at your feet, ducks swimming with their little ones, Sun is setting and Mount Konocti as a backdrop!< /Review>

Fun place hard to find hidden between homes next to lake. Live music today was very good 60's - 70's. Food was delicious and portions where large. Full bar and outdoor large patio next to lake.limited parking lot some street parking. Lots of people here having fun. Motorcycle clubs meet here for food, drink and dancing.  Lots of room for party's or groups. Boat dock attached to back of bar for boating stop and pick up of food and drinks. In the area fun place. Ice tea was very good. Huge selection of beverages from the large bar. Table service was a little slow but understandably very busy fun place on the weekend.</Text>

Below average fare in a questionable environment. The first word of bar and grill is bar which tells you food is not the top priority. Outside seating except they allow smoking which, correct me if needed, but I thought all smoking was banned in public places, much less food establishments. We had two jags chain smoking cigars with no regard for anyone else. I guess that's what makes cigar smokers so special. Anyway, if you can't find any other food, this will pass. Cheese and crackers from Safeway will save you a bunch of money and be about as palatable.<//Review>

My best friend forgot his phone and they watched after it until he returned. During all this you have to get food with your drink we didn't realise at first but you can even just get fries and the fries there are delicious. ... If i had to complain id make the very small complaint that parking is abit limited and kinda dodgy but due to that its quiet and not over crowded so to me that's a plus. And i liked it so much il be stopping by again today on my way out of town for a pint.< /text>< pictures>

Great food, atmosphere, band on the patio on Sunday. Service person was on the move doing her very best. All in all great day with my daughter and family from Sacratomato. Haters, try to wait on inside and out at once. Better yet try a busy shift on Sat. Like you've never had a bad day at work. 200% satisfied.</text>

<Review>It seems the restaurant is under new management as of Feb. 2020 (just in time for the Shelter in Place) and my experiences there all occurred previously to the change.  I'll have to drag myself in there when the Corona thing has passed (if they are still open) and write an updated review.  So take this for what it's worth.

The boathouse is a great place if you like to drink at the bar or come up from the water in a boat to drink on the deck.  They certainly seem to try hard at making a nice restaurant looking at the menu items and selection but when the place is absolutely empty except for your party and it takes over an hour to serve three main dishes and they are cold and stale you have to wonder what the problem is.  At least this has been my experience about a dozen times over the last 4-5 years.

Sure the dining room is quite dated and could use a deep cleaning, I don't mind that.  Also, the staff seem like well meaning people who are trying their best but if you're gonna run a restaurant the guests need hot fresh food in a timely manner.  Now if you're a drinker perhaps you can knock back a couple of high balls and by the time the food comes you're too buzzed to care that it's not hot or it has been an hour and a half after you received your salad/soup/app or isn't fresh and flavorful even if there are only the three or four of your group in the entire restaurant.  In fact reading through some of the 5 star reviews you might notice how many times the 'great bartender' is mentioned or the pool table or that many of the food items mentioned are basically deep fried bar food..

Now the place does have a pretty regular and busy section but that is in the bar/deck.  Since I haven't been a drinker in a long time I couldn't comment on that part but they do seem to be having a pretty good time by the sound.  The Boat House to me is like an old school Bar and Grill where the grill is there when the bar crowd need something to eat long after the Happy Hour has past.    My best experiences have been ordering take out and would suggest this to anyone focused on the food.  Sure it's usually cold by the time you get it home but you expect that.  They also generally have it ready to go when you show up.

I'm not trying to be negative this is just my honest in my assessment.  I've worked in nearly a dozen restaurants over the years and eaten at a few too.  I also live about three blocks from the place.  The only reason I've frequented the place regularly is that my parents always want to go there when visiting because it's on the lake, despite my protestations.< /Review><rate>2</rate>< response>

I don't know why this place isn't packed at all times. The food I got was amazing! I got the seafood platter with garlic fries and the calamari was to die for ❤ The service was great! Best place to get cocktails in upper lake since I've been here. Its so relaxing and by the lake. I will always come here for dinner.</text>

<Text>Food is really good. The outside seating is right on the water. There is lots of shade with the umbrellas. Drinks are great, especially when Diane or that cute little guy with brown hair and killer smile are making tgem.  Relaxing and fun. Music on the weekends. Go and try it.</Text>< Pictures>

Edit... Good food... slow service...Great view, watch for the ocean like experience. Waves crashing, white caps.  Happens in the mid/late afternoon.... Waited 45 minuets for a burger and some fried food.  Watched the others served before us that arrived after us.  We have given this place many tried being we can't take the boat... But you must have allot of patience and time.<//review>

<review>Love the food and the atmosphere! Great lake views from the bar or patio seating. Has it's own dock so you can come in right off the lake. Don't come if you are in a hurry, food always takes a long time to come out whether its busy or not.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

First half the food on the menu was not available. They were out of half the appetizers and Entrees.   It was a Saturday evening and should have had these items available. Our waitress served a meal to our table and it wasn't correct. Then she tried to serve another nine of us ordered. Another lady came out yelling at her in front of us.  Then we got our bill, one from bar and one from meals.  We paid the tab. As we were outside getting ready to leave the waitress comes running outside saying we owe more money. The meal she gave incorrectly shouldn't have been charged. We had 4 glasses of champagne and were charged for 8. Very bad experience.<//Text>

<Review>The best food! Try the seafood basket, ribeye, chicken avocado sandwich, fish & chips ! Everything is good! Big servings. Sitting on the outdoor deck is serene & beautiful. In the winter there is fire going. I would have given 5 stars but the service is awful!!! Wait 30 minutes for drinks & had to ask where they were. Food is worth wait 😁 One time the waitress was using the F bomb in conversation with guests...maybe her friends??? I still go back for the atmosphere & food.<//Review>< Pictures>

Early dinner with a Friend in the Dining Room, where I was most pleasantly surprised by the menu options! I chose the Caesar Salad with Grilled Prawns. The Prawns were great ~ plump, juicy, and seasoned to perfection! Since I am a local resident, I will return!
Oh, the Strawberry Shortcake, our dessert choice was fantastic, with fresh whipped cream!
Server was delightful, and the upbeat  Friday afternoon atmosphere added to our experience!<//text>< resp>

This is a great place to go just for the location and a full service bar food is good I just wish I could get a burger or steak cooked rare to med rare this is not just a problem here but almost everywhere I go. That said I still recommend the Boathouse it's a fun place to go.😎< /text>

Delicious inexpensive food. Very polite, attentive, genial and quick service. OK beer, not great but wasn't anticipating a lot of great craft beer options either. I came for the view at sunset and got a great seat outside on the deck with my son. The frogs came out -- even a few red-legged ones -- at dusk. It was busier and more social indoors and was quite chill and relaxed outdoors.</Review>

<Review>if you want a piece of local treasure you'll have to stop by this joint for at least a bloody mary if not a full-blown meal and I would highly suggest walking to the back patio for an amazing view from the deck.
make sure to check out the back bar as well for some amazing customer service from one of the best bartenders in northern California.<//Review></record>

Love the atmosphere and the staff was great. Limited menu though.  Going to the warf not wanting to eat hamburgers or fish and chips or fried food. Great oysters though. Need more fresh seafood choices.<//Text>

<review>They have large servings and great prices. The food is excellent and the service is decent. Sometimes it can take a moment to be served but usually they tend to be busy and the food more than makes up for it.</review>< pictures>

<Text>2nd  time no service... first time I got a menu, no drinks, and waited at least 15 minutes before I left. Second time no one even looked in the restaurant, then one waitress came in to check on her customers, didn't even look at me and went out. Waited 10 minutes altogether then as I was getting ready to leave a waitress noticed me and asked someone from the kitchen if they could wait on me... terrible service<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We were traveling through and were looking for something much better than fast food. We found it. Very unique !! We sat on an open deck overlooking the lake. What a beautiful view at sundown. Prices were reasonable food was excellent Service couldn't have been any better. Thank you for being in the right place at the right time for us. We will come back</review>

The atmosphere is GREAT. At times, the view can be breath taking. I love the steamers(clams) aways perfect☺. The owner, Diane, she's an absolute Gem💎! They have a fantastic bar with the best view of the lake you tend to be hypnotized by it. I personally love boating right to it! Great docking,
Easy in, easy out...with the right wind (lol).<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Start to finish, it was just awful! When we got there, there was nobody sitting in the dining area. several people at the bar, and 3 tables fiull out on the deck. We asked to sit out there, and they said no, they're not set up to serve out there. ( Even as I watched them being food to these tables outside, but, yeah, whatever.)

We rarely saw our server. She popped by once in awhile to mutter a sorry about this, and that. We ordered garlic chicken wings, which were DISGUSTING! They were Luke warm, and at the bone was ICE COLD. Being at it looked cooked, this was obviously frozen precooked garbage that they couldn't even heat right. ( Guess I'm lucky they didn't actually cook them).

I ordered the fettuccine with chicken. The fettuccine was ok. Bland, but creamy. The chicken was rubber, and I'm pretty sure from the awful consistency,  and freezer burned taste, that it was not fresh. The seasoned fries were ok. A dab of flavor, but at least these were cooked.

Hubby got chicken fried steak, that was cooked. It was cooked so well, the outside was about burnt. Never seen a steak this well done before. Pretty sure it was just steak. It was tough, and hard to cut. Usually chicken fried steak is super tender. But, I'm sure they didn't know, since everything is frozen and processed, and not made there. (Guessing)

We ordered two blue Hawaiians, which, the bartender tried, but they were disgusting. She never made one, and I guess winged it. She did offer to fix it, if we didn't like it, but we were already  disgusted with this place, we didn't. even bother.

Best thing was the raspberry cheesecake, which came from the cheesecake factory. lol. I think this place  has a fridge and microwave, and that's their source of cooking. NOTHING was fresh, or even good.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Ordered the Jalapeño burger. It was cooked medium-well, but was still juicy. The lettuce, tomato, and onion were fresh and crisp. Fries were fresh and crisp. Service was great. Good prices.< /review>

Start to finish, it was just awful! When we got there, there was nobody sitting in the dining area. several people at the bar, and 3 tables fiull out on the deck. We asked to sit out there, and they said no, they're not set up to serve out there. ( Even as I watched them being food to these tables outside, but, yeah, whatever.)

We rarely saw our server. She popped by once in awhile to mutter a sorry about this, and that. We ordered garlic chicken wings, which were DISGUSTING! They were Luke warm, and at the bone was ICE COLD. Being at it looked cooked, this was obviously frozen precooked garbage that they couldn't even heat right. ( Guess I'm lucky they didn't actually cook them).

I ordered the fettuccine with chicken. The fettuccine was ok. Bland, but creamy. The chicken was rubber, and I'm pretty sure from the awful consistency,  and freezer burned taste, that it was not fresh. The seasoned fries were ok. A dab of flavor, but at least these were cooked.

Hubby got chicken fried steak, that was cooked. It was cooked so well, the outside was about burnt. Never seen a steak this well done before. Pretty sure it was just steak. It was tough, and hard to cut. Usually chicken fried steak is super tender. But, I'm sure they didn't know, since everything is frozen and processed, and not made there. (Guessing)

We ordered two blue Hawaiians, which, the bartender tried, but they were disgusting. She never made one, and I guess winged it. She did offer to fix it, if we didn't like it, but we were already  disgusted with this place, we didn't. even bother.

Best thing was the raspberry cheesecake, which came from the cheesecake factory. lol. I think this place  has a fridge and microwave, and that's their source of cooking. NOTHING was fresh, or even good.<//Text>

Food was good but service was extremely poor ticket time was over an hour.  Waitress said she would discount for the very slow service but took off only one beer off for the whole tab of four people.  It was around 1:15 and the restaurant was not that busy.  Owner/manager was nowhere to be found while service was seem to be having a meltdown.</review>

The one thing I didn't appreciate that I used to appreciate there at our boat house is the fact that the food and quality there in of is nothing of what it used to be and the portions are so God damn small it's almost not worth it to me to buy it besides that it's a wonderful atmosphere The Waitresses are on time courteous and prompt it's just something about that food I used to get there and the stuff they serve now not enough...?!<//review>

I sure do love waiting an hour for one burger! It's so much fun just sitting outside in the scorching heat. I especially love it when the anti-social waiters come out to ask if I want a refill (which they don't give me for over 30 minutes). The food is pretty good though, especially because I'm allergic to fish. I specifically told them that I can't eat any type of fish, So when I asked for the burger with a side of fries I was shocked that the fries tasted like fish. They obviously fry their fries and their fish in the same frier and don't give a damn about people with allergies. So sadly I had to spend the rest of my busy day in an emergency room.< /Text>

<text>Food is good but only if your willing to wait 2+ hours for it. So don't come here expecting you'll be eating soon. Second time here, thought I'd give it another chance after my first experience which was horrible; it took them more then the 2+ hours it normally takes and they still messed up our order. I don't think I'll be coming back as they messed up my order again< /text>< gmapID>

Food is good. View is beautiful from the patio. But the service is pretty slow, so it's not a good choice, if  you're not willing to be patient.<//Text>

fish and chips were disappointing,  the waitress seemed like she was ready to leave this place way before we got here and was horrible, the bartender started off great, but then completely forgot about us once her friends got here.  unless you are a local stay away</Text>

The Boathouse has been a staple for guests for some time now but recently new management took over the kitchen and really stepped up the menu and service. The food can best be described as comfort food with barbecue as well and a number of intriguing daily specials. There's a full bar as well with a view of Clear Lake plus outdoor seating in the summer with bands featured  on Sunday afternoons.

Recently we had some sandwiches delivered which is usually unremarkable but I happened to get the tri tip sandwich. Bottom line, the tri tip had a wonderful smoky flavor and was as tender as can be. I avoid tri tip sandwiches because you usually end up with gristle surprise which ruins the experience - not in this case. It was tender and meaty from bite one to the end. The only disappointment was having finished the sandwich, darnit. But they'll make more!

We have sent many guests down the street to the Boathouse and have heard plenty of very positive reviews of the food and service. Being regulars ourselves we can attest to the warm atmosphere of this local hangout. The food is consistent and good, prices are very fair and service is generally quite good as well. We're pretty fortunate to have such a cool local hangout just a few steps down the street from us.</text>
