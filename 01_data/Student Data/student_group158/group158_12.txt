<review>Ordered a fish taco. Received a taco with no fish inside, just lettuce and avo. Only noticed when I opened it a few miles down the beach. Ordered a margarita. No tequila inside. Same story. Not a great experience.</review>< UserId.>

Food was alright, granted we stopped after just getting out of the city cause we were hungry, and knew what we were getting into, a tourist trap. So the food was a little pricey for what it was and the service was slow. We were passed around 3 hosts/servers before we were sat in a pretty empty restaurant. Again not complaining, we knew, the food was decent, would stop again in the same circumstance.</Review>

<Review>I have been eating here since 2013 ... it is such a shame that the customer service is the way it is. Everyone in this establishment is SO rude and they do not care about their job/customers. The food is good for a quick bite by the beach but such a shame. They need to start all over again with the staff.</Review>< user_id>

I'm reserving a star for consistency: we'll be back.  We had 2 orders of the crunchy, hot & perfectly cooked fish and chips and then an order of chili cheese fries.  We were hungry.  Everything came quickly and was very tasty.  Perfect for pre-dusk outdoor cheap eats at the beach.  The tiny table near the shack was clean and well situated near a propane space heater.

I would have left the fries in the boiling oil for maybe 45-60 seconds longer, but then I like them crunchy.  So that's just me.  I'm sure that the friendly staff would have obliged.

I feel a warning is due however, though it has nothing to do with the quality of the food or service: this place closes promptly at 7.  As we were digging the last delicious chili nuggets out of the bottom of the paper dish around 7:20pm, various people approached the snack bar and were disappointed that it had closed.

Don't be those people.

The cafe that shares the building with the snack bar is considerably more sophisticated and the prices reflect this.  So make a point to drop by the snack bar earlier and take advantage of the warming tower things.

We'll be back.<//text>

My friend asked for the Walt special (basically a hot dog) instead they gave him the sausage in a burger bun with cheese and no mustard or anything just cheese sausage and a hotdog bun. Also don’t spend your money here. We were loyal to them but they don’t have great service. I hope this place can get better</text>

<Text>HORRIBLE customer service. I was denied service for having my own mask, was told to buy a $2 mask and put it on, so while doing all that i was exposed to the crowd around me by takin my mask off and putting his mask on. Where is the logic here??? You made me take my mask off right in front of you and also when people order they pull the masks off. I came with my wife stood in line which was a waste of 35 minutes. Don't recommend< /Text>< pics>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Would not recommend. Owner was rude. My daughter and I came for some ice cream, stood in line for 30min and by getting to the window they tell me that they can’t sell me anything without a mask. On the other hand, they offered to sell me a super expensive “cheap” mask first and then I can buy from them. So they are willing to sell me a mask and hand it into my hands, but not food. I can’t comprehend the lunacy and hypocrisy. And after I took off my shirt and covered my face, they said sorry that’s not a mask and still would not sell my daughter some ice cream. So we left this place with my daughter crying. We went to another place down the street and they sold us ice cream no problem.< /text><user>108473878635456651214</user><rate>1<//rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>Only had the ice cream and baked goods, but they were delicious. The ice creams are rich and flavorful, the pastries are sweet moist moist and the pizza is delightful if you're into sourdough (which I am not). The only problem is the layout. It is a busy spot and the lines tend to extend in front of the building, but there's no real space between the parking for the cars and the spot for the lines. Also, make sure you know if you're in line for the coffee bar or the main take out window. They tend to merge and make it seem longer than it may be.<//text>< Pictures>

Cross eyed employee likes to close up 45 minutes early then re-open when a couple of girls show up.... I confronted him about it but he brushed us off. Also I saw him coughing in the burgers so be careful.<//Text>

This is about the bakery at Parkside -
This might be one of the best bakeries in Marin. One would not think there would be an excellent French bakery in the little town of Stinson Beach, but there is. Perfectly flakey and buttery croissants. Other delicious morning pastries. And thankfully a bunch of savory vegetarian pastries. Reasonably priced, delicious coffee. The cheese bread loaf is a thing of dreams. This little spot is worth a visit when in Stinson.< /review>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Some of the web info is out of date. We went to a proper restaurant in the evening. The evening meal features serious haute cuisine, some excellent dishes displaying real skill by what must be a talented chef, including a crab risotto of exceptional quality, a delicious clam chowder, and some superbly cooked tuna, and a very good avocado pasta. The green salad was very fine. We (British tourists) ate there two nights running and had the two best meals in three weeks in the USA. A special eatery in a very special place. Why no fifth star? Nobody is perfect!</Review>< Pictures>

Parkside has a snack bar, café, a market, and restaurant. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor dining. Some of the items the snack bar offers is hamburgers, chicken nuggets, fries, milkshakes, and soft serve ice cream. If you are in Stinson Beach, it's a great place to grab a meal to go. Beware, the snack bar does not have a bathroom. If you want to eat higher end food, you can use the bathroom in the restaurant. Parkside has the best selection of food options in Stinson Beach.< /review>

Pretty solid but nothing too remarkable. A good spot to get a quick snack before or after going to the beach or a doing a hike in the area. Got fries which were alright and a canned beer which was kind of warm. Also, no bathroom for non sitting customers even though the entire stretch is the same extended strip of shops.</review>

Our server though, didn't seem happy about it and shortly after we finished our food said they were preparing for dinner and didn't allow people to be working on their computer for dinner....also, there was only one other party in the entire restaurant when that happened. We wanted to like this place since we love local business and it's adorable, but that turned us off.< /Review>< pictures>

In our short visit, the service was good! Love how close and convenient it is to the beach/beach parking lot! The area is clean for the most part. It's a walk-up window, order/pick-up system so patronizing with our dog was A+ excellent! The burgers or whatever was grilling smelled yummy! Will definitely try the burger next time and maybe some chili cheese fries? The prices are very much hiked! I'm sure it's because of the location, but hey, that's the cost of convenience!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Parkside Snack Bar:
This Place used to be really great. However, more recently the prices of ice cream (which used to be really cheap for a large serving) have gone up over a dollar and the portion has gone way down. You basically pay $2.50 for less than a mouthful of ice cream. You be the judge, but to me, that is a complete rip off. I would not recommend this place for ice cream.<//Review>

<text>We had been told about Stinson Beach, so we took the drive there and enjoyed some time on the sand.  It was November, so we were not swimming, but there were some surfers out in the water.  We still enjoyed walking the beach, and grabbing lunch at the Parkside.  In our group, we had their veggie burger (looked home-made, not store bought processed one), along with a cheeseburger, grilled tuna sandwich, and an order of their fish & chips.  Everything was very good.  Only downside is that they do not have any seating protected from the winds, nor any heaters, which would have been nice on the cool, windy day when we were there.  I'd go back here again next time we are in the area, so long as it's a decent day outside.  If it's windy & cool, next time we'll look for other options.< /text>< Pics>

Being visiting the Parkside Cafe for @ 10 years now when I have my annual holiday in San Francisco. I have had many a good meal there service is good with staff that are polite and friendly.

Only one little gripe why so little fruit now on your lovely waffles?

Hope to see you again in the coming year<//Review>

This is for the outside walk up service..
The menu is great. The bacon burger is awesome. Its a throw back so if your looking for a monster burger this is not it. It's less than a 1/4 lb but served with thick bacon and relish. Very similar to Tic Tocs in San Francisco back in the day. In other words, its a classic beach burger. The fries were topped off with salt and pepper and the smoothie was great with no yogurt so its a beverage not a meal.
Also, the twist cone was really good. Kid friendly spot with a play structure across the street.<//review>

Solid place to order some food and carry to the nearby park for a picnic. Food was good, but if you're ordering the brisket, I hope you're not looking for something meaty<//text>

<Text>Stumbled across this place while on an impromptu drive through Stinson Beach. Very friendly service and good food. The burger was made from Niman Ranch beef! You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find good quality meat at restaurants in NYC and Jersey City, so I really appreciate that this place takes care in their sourcing. Also, the bread and pastries are all made in house. Along with beer from a local brewery in Fairfax, I was impressed with this quaint spot on the beach. You don't get that kind of quality in most touristy locations. They also have a patio outside, and all heaters looked functional to me. Try it out next time you're in the area.</Text><rating>5<//rating>< Pictures>

Ok the bread is now baked fresh and sold at the restaurant.  That's fine.  It's great bread, I really like it BUT they are now offering it to you by your wait person as " Can I get you started with some bread?"   Sure I said assuming we were going to get bread put on the table like all restaurants do.   Well it turns out it costs 3:00 !!!    They didn't mention that!   And it didn't make it to the table until AFTER we got our dinner.
The fish tacos were the best thing on the menu............for some reason they changed them and they are the now the worst thing on the menu.  They are impossible to eat!!  The fish is not fried and it isn't put in the tortilla so you have to TRY to pick it up to do so  and it falls apart before you even get it close.  So frustrating! Not good.  I went home with a horrible stomach ache  that night to boot.</text>

<Review>We first approached the snack bar and the gentleman working there greeted us with, “what do you want” very rudely and was rude the whole time and got annoyed when we asked him questions. We finally got are burgers and the bread was 3x the size of the burger patty. We also got a clam chowder that was cold and asked them to heat it up and said they couldn’t warm it up or do anything about it. Awful experience, will never come again. The fountain drink station was full of bees in the soda nozzles. Awful!</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Horrible customer service –the hostess/manager is extremely rude. Parkside might as well post a sign stating that “your business is not welcome here.”  Go elsewhere –Sand Dollar, Breakers, and Lunchbox offer far superior food and service.

While my most recent experience on 9/20/2015, I have talked to others -both Stinson residents and visitors- who have also experienced the horrible service at Parkside Cafe.<//review>

<UserId.>104981312154361356048< /UserId.><review>The food here was fine, but not spectacular, especially for how much it cost. The fresh bread was good, but the french fries were mediocre and not helped by the fact that they were room temperature. At dinner we had the club sandwiches with ahi tuna and crab cake, and they were just okay. The brioche buns were tasty, but not really sturdy enough for the sandwiches. We also had breakfast here and the scrambled eggs and bacon were good, but both the French toast and the buttermilk pancake were kind of meh. If we'd gotten out of there for $20 it would have been fine, but it was closer to twice that. Service at breakfast on Sunday morning at 7:30 was speedy, but service at dinner on Saturday night was way too slow. We waited a long time for our bread appetizer to be delivered and then even longer for a cup of soup to arrive before our entrees. And it was really loud inside at dinner when it was busy. Hard to have a conversation in here without shouting over everyone else.</review>< date>

<Text>Place was beautiful, well decorated, really nice view. I sat on the patio. It took a long time for us to order and even longer for them to bring the food out. They had four heaters on the patio but only one was running and it was cold out. They had only one bathroom for men and women to share and there was constantly a line 2-4 people long. When I went in line to use the restroom the waitress gave me a snoody attitude and asked if I was dining with them. I said I was on the patio and it was obvious she didn't believe me. She was unnecessarily rude and it left a bad impression with me. The food was decent but overpriced.</Text>< pics>

We were five friends and two kids waiting to have dessert and coffee, after being asked in a very rude way to wait outside of the stablishment  We waited for 30 minutes outside and when finally we sat and started to order, the waitress left and came 2 minutes after, hurried us to leave the table informing us that they couldn't serve us dessert and coffee not giving us a choice to sit and have a coffee at the bar...???  We felt discriminated by our look and accent. In Europe we appreciate tourists, a great disappointment at Stinson beach.</review><Name>trancedrum555< /Name><UserId.>101600010679349592675< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Your sliced Levain bread is the best in Marin.
I'm only reviewing the bread, not the cafe.

Food wasn't bad,  but service was slow and overpriced.

I can tell they take advantage of being one of the few restaurants in town.</text>

The service was terrible! Only one bathroom, had to wait 15 minutes each time we had to use the restroom. The food was ok at best yet completely over priced. the waitress was a bit rude and to top it off she charged us twice! Now im trying to get the second charge dropped to no avail!< /review>

<Review>I gave this restaurant two stars, mainly because it was below average for the price, which was moderately expensive, and the wait staff wasn't that friendly.  However, from driving around stinson and reading reviews of other restaurants, this place is probably one of the best restaurants in town.  The food was good, and they had good beer.  The view out the window is of a park, although I thought the park looked kinda ratty.  (At the time, there was a couple inch puddle of water across most of it.)  On the other side of the park are the sanddunes, on the other side of which is the beach.  You can't see the beach from the restaurant.

I got the white wine seafood pasta, which was good, although I prefer it a little more creamy.</Review><name>Steven Baker</name><Gmap_id>0x808593cf2dc72573:0x7982a736ed5a943e</Gmap_id>< resp>

We were at Stinson beach last Sunday and we wanted to grab lunch so we headed down to Parkside Cafe around 2 PM since it is the closest to the beach. Outdoor seating had a 30 minute wait so we just headed in the restaurant where seating was easily available. We ordered garlic cheesy bread which was served hot and garlicky within 15 minutes. We also got the polenta burger and onion rings which to our surprise took 30-40 minutes to be served after the order. The burger was nice, it had a good taste/texture and wasnt too heavy. Burger came with fries which were crisp and fresh. On the contrary, the onion rings took even longer to be served and were drenched in oil. They were so oily that we couldnt finish the 4 huge onion rings that were served. After having the first one we saw the oil on the plate of onion rings and that was it. We decided to not go to this place again.< /Text>

<Review>RUDE!!!
Went here at around 6pm. The guy with the messed up eyes was taking our order. He was very impatient and had a terrible attitude. We are a family of five and each member placed an order. At every order, he would sigh, roll his messed up eyes and give us our total when we weren't even finished with our order yet. He made us feel unwelcome so we didn't continue with our order and canceled it instead. Very obvious that he hates his job. Maybe the reason his eyes are messed up is because he kept rolling his eyes so much on every person he had to wait on.< /Review><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The service at both parkside restaurants (inside and out) is the worst I've had in the entire Bay Area and the owner (Maxine) is practically abusive to customers.  We've been here dozens of times and the most recent visit was over the top bad.  Spend your money elsewhere and visit Breakers for breakfast or the new-ish Siren cafe (right on the beach) for lunch/early dinner.  Or really any other restaurant in Stinson.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

It was okay.  It seemed like a place for the locals.  Nothing special, but nothing horrible.  No view of the ocean, but a view of the hillside.   Prices were a little pricey especially for breakfast items.</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Hmmm...where to start?  Ambiance was about the only redeeming quality, and maybe the vintage white bar stools in the waiting area..those were kind of cool too.  My girlfriend and I dared to try it out despite all of the negative reviews and we crapped out across the board.  This is what we got for 54 dollars (tip included):  2 crab cakes that looked suspiciously of the frozen variety, a decent burger and a mountain of standard variety french fries.  In retrospect, I think the bread out of the oven may have been the best part of the meal.  It's now 5 hours later and my girlfriend has an upset stomach and is releasing farts strong enough to kill a donkey or send poltergeist ghosts on to the next house.  This is not the way I envisioned our last night in Stinson at our romantic beach house getaway.  Given the gross overpricing alone, I would strongly urge anybody visiting Stinson to give this place a pass.  A wiser move would be hitting up the Whole Foods in Mill Valley and stocking up before coming down if your accommodation has a fridge and kitchen unit.</text><Date>1319962240742< /Date>< name>

Apparently ordering coffee and desert doesn't qualify you for a seat in the mostly empty cafe (only one other table was taken)....were actually asked to leave.  Can't wait for starbucks to take over this lamo place<//text>

If you're dark brown, this place will make you feel unwelcome.

From the front door to our table, I got stopped 3 times. Once to be questioned why I'm just walking straight in. Next was that I shouldn't skip the toilet queue so I had to tell them, that's not what I'm here for. Why people assume without asking pisses me off. Lastly, I was questioned where I was going so I pointed to the table where all my friends were sitting at already. By the time I sat down, I was so annoyed and had wished I had walked in with all my WHITE friends.

Whatever happened to, 'Welcome to Parkside' can I help you?' Instead of accusing and assuming. Why are staff so quick to judge negatively? I was not dressed like a bum or anything.

One apologized but I had already lost my appetite and felt so uncomfortable.

The table I sat at had prime view of the front door  so I can see who goes in and out. In the hour I was there, people would walk in all the time, just like I did. NOONE ELSE WAS STOPPED LIKE I WAS. Even the ones that would just stroll straight to the toilet. Then again, I didnt see anyone dark skinned.

To add to the insult, I had ordered onion rings. Everyone's food arrived and even though the server (blonde blue eyed) saw I had nothing in front of me, she said nothing.
Nothing like, 'Did you order?' or 'have u ordered' Though she had taken all our orders and I was not last to order either. Finally after 5 mins, thank goodness I asked. Server told me that someone else took my order and that a fresh batch is getting made. Needless to say, friends waited for me to be done since it was too hot to eat when it finally arrived.

My hubby who is a fan of clam chowder didn't even want to tolerate the small cup. It was so thick. You could pick up the soup with your fork. Just like the white paste you use it school.

I had been at the cafe earlier to get food to go and the folks there were no better. I had mentioned that the mayo had run out and would there be more. The only response from this guy was, 'no more mayo!' then walked away. If you hate your job, don't take it out on the customer!

This place is very popular and right by the entrance to the beach so perhaps they do not see a need to have repeat business in mind. I do not need to ever step foot here. Food is not that unique or to die for.

There are a ton more awesome cafes here to try. I will be avoiding Parkside like a plague.

What is the world coming to when we cannot even just be kind to a fellow human being?</Text>< pictures>

Despite the sometimes long lines, the service here is pretty fast. Great place to grab a greasy bite to eat on your way too or from the beach.< /review>

I've aten here for about 20yrs and the food has always been delicious!!! Its like a mixture of Chris's Burgers and In n Out. I always get their cheeseburger special and the milkshakes are delicious too! This place needs more publicity, it definitely deserves more love than it gets by having such good food 😩😋<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

This place is the best! Receptionist is very polite.  They give you a tour when you first come in. The inside of the place looks brand new, hip, and is clean. I went in to see Dr. Casey to remedy constant sciatic pain I was having after going to a physical therapist that was no help. Dr. Casey and the rest of the staff were very friendly. Dr. Casey took the time to answer every questions I had very thoroughly. After the first visit, I immediately felt better (This was just my experience. Obviously everyone’s is going to be different based on your circumstances). The next day my pain was nearly gone and I no longer had problems and severe pain when standing up and walking. I am continuing to see Dr. Casey even after he thoughtfully recommended a colleague of his that was more local to my home. I turned it down after being so happy with my experience at Life Source  chiropractic. I feel the drive is worth it. Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a good chiropractor.< /text>

<text>Pleasantly surprised at finding this gem in this shopping center. Super clean with very friendly staff. I have been hesitant to go many places during the pandemic, but needed to go back to the chiropractor. This office is big enough to adhere to covid distancing guidelines, is clearly well kept, and everyone wears their masks correctly making my visit stress free. I will be bringing my children back and foresee being a continuing customer and patient.</text>< pictures>

<Review>My current experience with Lifesource has been amazing.  I feel so relieved to be able to move around with less lower pain discomfort.  I would like to thank Drs: Chase Parlett, Kasey Pierce, and front office Karla for the best way to accommodate my availability with their service.  I also, want to thank my loving care granddaughter Selena Mora for referring me to this wonderful group.  And last but not least...
The most gentle and caring “Mr.  Bone”
Thank you for making me feel good 🙏🏼<//Review>< Pictures>

UPDATE 3/29/21: This is my second time around being treated at Life Source Chiropractor and I totally recommend them! Dr. Kasey and Dr. Chase are true professionals and they have truly made a difference. Thank you so much for such a welcoming environment and turning this painful situation into a bearable one!

I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first. Needless to say my thought process has totally changed. It wasn't until recently I realized that nagging back pain I had become accustomed to was now barely there. Thank you Dr. Chase, Dr. Kasey, and Stephanie! You guys make an awesome team!< /text>

<Text>When I was searching for a chiropractor after a car accident. I was reading reviews and it was hard to believe that Life Source Chiropractic had 5 stars! But then after going there for a few months, I could see why. They have excellent customer service! The overall feeling of the office and staff is very comfortable.  The doctors are really nice and cool. The best part is they fixed me! Check these guys out and give them a chance. Especially if you've had a bad experience in the past at a chiropractor. They will change your mind  and make you happy.  Thanks Life Source for an overall great experience!!</Text></record>

I brought my son to Life Source Chiropractic when he was only three months old after a PT noticed he had torticollis. Dr. Kasey was absolutely wonderful! He answered several questions on the phone and in person. I was so nervous to have adjustments done on such a young child, but Dr. Kasey explained that the pressure they use is the amount of pressure you would feel comfortable placing on your eyelid. He was so gentle with my son and corrected the issue in only two visits. Everyone at this practice is kind and helpful. It is obvious how much they care about their work and their patients. I highly recommend their pediatric services.< /Review>

Got into a car accident and was appointed here. I gotta say, no regrets at all in coming here. I feel way better since I walked in those doors. The whole team there makes you feel welcomed and not to mention donuts on Thursdays?! If you bring family members or friends, I guarantee you that they will provide a heart warming experience. Don’t be afraid to start conversations, it’s really fun to talk with them.<//Text>

Dr. Chase is great.  He corrected my back pain only after two adjustments.  Office staffs are very friendly, nice, and they make the office visits so easy.  They are very flexible on schedule and all way accommodating my busy work schedule.  Great job guys.  Highly recommended Life Source Chiropractic.<//review>

I’m impressed how he X-ray and scanEd my back. He gave me and throughout exam and I actually understood what he meant and how my back can be corrected ( this was never done to me before).

Customer service it’s great and I glad I came here and definitely I won’t be changing chiropractors ever !! Highly recommend<//review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Three years ago, I injured my back & haven't felt right since. During that time, I worked with 5 different chiropractic offices that each told me that they understood why I was in pain & that they were capable of helping me heal. With each chiropractor I worked with, I felt so excited to hear that addressing my pain was a reality, & that they could help me get back to feeling normal. Unfortunately, each time I was told that, I continued to feel pain & discomfort. I was at the end of my rope, didn't even believe chiropractors could help me any longer, & was emotionally in the dumps due to my constant discomfort.

Then, about 4 months ago, I met Dr. Chase. After discussing my situation with him, he convinced me to give chiropractic care one more chance - I was apprehensive at first but figured, what the heck - let's give it one more try.

After 4 months of treatments, this week was the first full week in 3 years that my discomfort hasn't kept me up at night or affected me throughout my entire day & I believe it's due to the quality care I received at Life Source Chiropractic. Beyond their high level of care, their support staff has been impeccably professional, positive, & helpful. Take it from someone that knows local chiropractors - don't waste your time & energy going elsewhere. Stop reading reviews now & just go ahead & schedule your appointment. It'll be the best decision you make for your health this year.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Could not be more happy with my experience here. Dr. Chase and his team are very good with being gentle and sensitive. I have had dizziness for years and within one session from what I can tell it has decreased. I had x rays done which gave me peace of mind knowing that I didn’t have any major issues.

Dr. Chase and staff are absolutely amazing and the type of service provided is exceptional. Life Source Chiropractic truly does find the root of your issue and makes sure you're back to 100 through targeted adjustments . They go above and beyond what you'd normally expect from a chiropractor. Be advised! You will fall in love with Life Source Chiropractic .< /Review>

<review>The ADJUSTMENT: I'm grateful to have met Dr. Patrick Pierce. As a cook in a busy restaurant, I spend 50-60 hours on my feet and Patrick's weekly adjustments help ease the tension and aches that I experience in my feet, neck and lower back from my day-to-day. Over the length of my treatment, in addition to exercise and diet, I've become more flexible and experienced less symptoms of numbness and fatigue. San Marcos is lucky to have such a good listener and motivated practitioner who genuinely cares about his work. Power's on, Patrick!<//review>< Pics>

My past three months here at Lifesource Chiropractic have been amazing! The staff is very helpful with any questions or concerns that you may have. The doctors are amazing as well, people who genuinely love their career and want to help people with their body issues. At the beginning I was afraid going, after coming out of a car accident my body was still in shock and I was worried that this type of physical therapy would take a toll on my body. When I arrived they were very informative, taking X-Rays and showing me the different areas in my body that could be adjusted. After the first month it became a weekly routine coming in and I’ve always felt welcomed and at home. If you are looking for the right chiropractor this is the place for you. I would give more stars but the cap is only at 5, overall an amazing experience. Thank you Lifesource Chiropractic!<//Text>

First time getting chiropractic care and I am glad it’s with Dr. Chase! Was a little bit nervous after seeing movies with crackingchiropractors, but Dr. Chase and his staff are amazing at explaining everything and making sure their clients are educated! First time seeing x-rays of my spine and boy was it off! After throwing over a 50lb+ bag over my shoulder about a year ago my lower back had lots of pain. I decided to give chiropractic care a shot. Today was my first adjustment and I can say that I already feel better! Looking forward to my next appointment! (Thanks Carla for setting that up and dealing with my crazy scedhule)< /review>

Fantastic!  I am a full time driver. Driving all day, I have pain in lower back, neck, legs and very sad to say I am walking limping too. I am so happy to meet Dr.Patrick Pierce and with weekly visits help ease my pains, specially I have much more confidence in walking normal again. Thank you Dr. Patrick Pierce< /review>

Been in treatment since September 2018 with Life Source Chiropractic. I have another 2 weeks to go and I been treated here for half year now. Today March 25th 2019 got out with no pain on my neck and feeling in alignment like never before in my life.
I have only good, very good and excellent things to say about this office.
From day one they all been very professional, courteous and with a bright smile on. I feel like home when come in here.
Thank you Dr. Chase Parlett, Dr. Kasey Pierce and Carla (as well Brittany in the past) the 2 sweet ladies at the reception area.
All of them been so amazing with me all these 6 months of treatment.
I referred you and I will continue to do so because I know your level of care for people, clients, and patients.
I also been treated as a member of a bigger family here, being invited to their few promotional parties and feeling so good to be around all of you.
This is the only place where they actually do an Rx before they start the treatment and have a computerized system in the room where you can see your spine Rx and been adjusted where is needed.
Because of their attention to detail I found out after 10 years from a car accident in the past that one of my cervical spinal process was  broken.
Been to another office before coming here, had an Rx done there and that dr. never saw or made me aware I have an old fracture on my cervical spine putting me to do tractions on that lower part of my cervical spine creating more damage to my neck.
As a CMT I need to function at full capacity and any disalighment can create more stress on my body.
Well here at this office I got realigned to the point of almost no pain.
Thank you Dr. Chase Parlett for your contribution to my wellbeing and recovery.
My gratitude to you.

When I began chiropractic care with him, I had been suffering from chronic almost daily headaches, low back pain, and difficulty sleeping. During the time I saw him, my headaches went away, my low back pain decreased, and I was able to get restful sleep once more! I was very grateful for the care Dr. Patrick provided and highly recommend him!<//Text>< Date>

Love local places like this. The diner is decorated nicely, kinda cowboy country house sort of feel. Got to talk to one of the owners about the menu and how the pulled pork was prepared, great stuff!

My two teenage boys had cowboy burgers. They loved em, ate em all up. They looked to me to have a good amount of char, thick pieces of bacon (cut nice to fit on the burger and not dangle out) and of course some melted cheese :)

I love pulled pork, so I went with the wrap. The smoky flavor was balanced nice with their Cole slaw. The pork did not have an overwhelming amount of smoked flavor. Their home made BBQ sauce went on it and paired wonderfully well. Their slaw is not runny which I prefer as well.

We all shared a larger order of onion rings and tried all three sauces. Soooo good. Event got some fries in there. They are not real thick, so a good amount of crunch which is what I like!

Full on soda fountain and I saw a couple sipping on bottled beer. I had complimentry water.

Definately a good place and worth the small drive out of the crowded city, take your kids. Gonna check out Ike's smokehouse in town later for the full smoked meat menu. I heard the ribs were awesome.

Go get your grub on!< /text>

The pulled pork is awesome! Just about everything on the menu is good so you can't lose. Price is a little more than other places for sandwich, fries and a soda but it was worth it.</Review>

Excellent! I've been wanting to try this place out for some time now and finally had the chance. My family and I are here and the service was great, everyone was friendly and the place was very clean. I had the Skippy peanut butter burger, my wife had the pulled pork sandwich and my daughter has a cheeseburger. As far as burgers goes, I enjoy them and every place that offers a gourmet burger burger I go to. I would say this place is in my top 5. I would and will recommend this place to people I know.

Thank you all for the good service.< /Text>

<Review>My wife and I both had the pulled pork sandwich. We both liked it. The BBQ sauce was just OK, probably not made in-house. The kids had the kids hamburger which was a perfect size for the under 6 crowd.
Don't let the attached storage facility keep you from trying this place, which is a little off the beaten path.< /Review><gmapID>0x8082deb4b6a54e05:0xc96fe1eebd8dbf55< /gmapID><name>Rob Pare<//name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This lunch stop was a treat! I have always have appreciated a unique place to eat with great food that is not a chain. The menu is creative and the staff is fantastic: friendly and accommodating. Our 11 y/o son commented that it was the best burger that he has ever had. My fiancee and I had the pulled pork wrap. It was fantastic and much better than its heavy sandwich version.<//Review>< pictures>

Food was great but the staff was a little unhelpful. For instance when we walked in we were not aware that you had to order from the counter and we stood for a while waited to be seated (normal) but no one explained just starred at us ... then said menus are over there. We also wasn't told about a full salad bar that was available in the corner until I went to the restroom and past it...then it was too late. The food is amazing just need to work harder on the meet and greet.< /Text>

This place is awesome. Everytime I'm headed back to Shasta County from Chico, Marysville, or Sac I make a point to stop by. Great food, and amazing sun tea. After early spring the "EAT" sign is blocked by a tree heading north on 99. It's right after the first set of business on the right after the gun shop and drive through coffee- Code 3 (again- heading North on 99). Worth the U-turn of you miss it.</Review>

Great find being up in Chico for an interview well worth it, we had the western burger and mushroom burner with sweet ptt fries and a coke too bad we had too run out to interview or we would had more.. delicious. Great hostess and cooks as well.< /Review>

I tried their famous peanut butter bacon burger was not impressed very expensive spent $24 for two burgers fries and two sodas< /Text>
<response>{'time': 1540491029608, 'text': 'Thanks for the reveiw Gary.  We are sorry you did not enjoy the peanut butter burger.  It is a burger that eiter hits a home run or strikes out!  I was just at Burger King...we were closed...and my friend ordered a burger.  I was interested to see how our price compared to a big chain restaurant.  He paid $7.49 for a specialty burger. Your burger, one of our gourmet burgers cost $6.49.  We try to keep our prices low enough so that it is affordable to come to a small town local Chico establishment as well as stay afloat in this economy.'}<//response>< Time>

< Review>
Good place, but a few nights ago a bartender told me, "you can spend this amount, but you can't afford to tip?". Now, i was there for a birthday, spent my money on the birthday boy, for the bartender to say that to me was rude and uncalled for. I don't know his name, but he was an old white guy.</Review>

<review>Rude bartender. We went to the bar, and found an open spot. The bartender pointed at this lady ordering a drink, then after came up tom friend and me and said "you can stand there all you want, I'm not going to tell you again".

Everything else was great, but frankly, the bartender being so rude when he could have come up to us the first time and said there was a line completely turned me off from the place. We left after that<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

It was the first over 21 bar I ever went to and I'll continue to be loyal. Menagerie is an amazing local bar! Plus the drinks are cheap and strong! Tony the bartender is my go to guy whenever I go. He makes the best drinks and is always a blast! It might not be a WEHO club, but there's definitely a reason why they have so many loyal regulars. I can't think of a better place in riverside! Check out their drag shows on Thursday!<//Text>< Pictures>

I would give 0 stars if possible! The new girl (assuming she is) was beyond rude when asked if she knew how to make a specific drink. One of the employees knew my brother and sister so I expected good service but instead but treated with sarcastic comments and rude comments. I would not recommend to star off or go to at all as the first bar. Awful. She was about 5"4 MAYBE  5'7 African american and short hair. Went to the point of trying to start a fight. So terrible.<//text>

The sign initially attracted me because it said it was a unique bar. It wasn't until I stepped inside did I realize it was a gay bar. I decided to sit down for a drink since I was already there. Lots of lights, techno music and open air inside the bar, felt pretty gay. The people seemed nice enough and the bartender called me baby, which I thought was adorable. Overall, a nice place to have a few drinks.<//Text>

Monday night karaoke is good. I bet is crazy crowded on weekends... small dance floor... you have to go to "the front" of the bar to order your drink... bartender was nice enough.... I'm used to bar mates making an effort to make you feel welcome and comfortable, no the case at this bar< /text>

A very Disrespectful DJ by the name of Shavo is why I’m leaving the bad review. When you lack integrity as an individual and your and your not considerate of how your actions affect other peoples lives you reap the reciprocity of those actions...

this guy needs to learn respect, you have to deal with the people in your community and around you on a regular and you ever know what will return when you move in bad character.< /review>

Spent the weekend in Riverside. With a town that only has 2 gay bars The Menagerie was a blast. Loved the music, mix of 90's dance and modern jams.Bartenders were friendly, worked fast, and poured a decent drink. David the owner was really nice gay ..May you keep The Managerie open another 34 years
Thanks.<//Review>

This gay bar is much more low key then the VIP. I like it because it’s not trying to be a trendy gay bar. There’s music and a dance floor. But if your like me and aren’t much in to dancing there’s a back room that opens up to a patio. The music volume is much lower in the area. Making it a good place to talk to friends. Though even in the back you’ll need to speak loudly. Oh yah, there’s a short to no line and no cover charge. Even on Friday night.

There are things I don’t like. If you want a drink, you need to stand in a line at one of two cash registers. My friend and I got a seat at the bar and for well over 30 min the bartender kept saying, “I’ll be right with you guys.” I think it was about 45 min until we realized that if we wherever going to get a drink, we would have to stand in line. The other thing I didn’t like was the fact that the bartenders didn’t want to give drink recommendations and where kind of rude.

Other then that, it’s an okay gay bar with no cover charge. Key word being “no cover charge!”<//Review>

I wouldn't call this place a gay bar, it's more of a gay club.  Music is loud, there is a dance floor, and there is an outdoor area for socializing and smoking.  This place is more like the club scene and VIP is more like the bar scene.
Bad part is, it does sometimes get hot and stuffy inside.</text>

< review>
This is an acceptable bar through most of the week.  The Monday night karaoke is great, as are the drag shows and live musical performances they've started having.  However, I strongly recommend steering clear of it on Friday and Saturday nights.  At these times, it is completely overrun by neighboring bars' overflow of random straight people, many of whom are quite rude and pushy.  Pushy in a very literal sense.

On my last Friday night here, I was talking to a friend by the bar.  I got shoved towards the bar by a stream of people, including the bouncer.  I tried to brace myself with one hand against the bar, to politely keep myself from tumbling into the other people there.  This wasn't good enough, as I still ended up bumping shoulders with some dude who was there with his wife (ugh).  He then got all pissy, as if I'd just goosed him or something, and shoved me back (double ugh).

Straight people at a gay bar--fine.  Hundreds of straight people at a gay bar--whatever.  Hundreds of straight people, who often get weird & defensive about their heterosexuality--too much.

I kinda feel bad complaining about this, as it's not really the bar's fault.  Although it does have plenty of other shortcomings.  There is no happy hour, and the drinks are overpriced.  Although there is apparently a DJ, it seems there is just one default playlist; you are almost guaranteed to hear that "I'm Sexy and I Know It" song anytime you go.  And of course, some of the bouncers are jerks.  But the bartenders are generally pleasant and doing their best.  The location is great, in lovely and increasingly lively downtown Riverside (though this is both a blessing and a curse).  And I can't help but have affection for it--it is after all one of only two gay bars in town.  I just wish it were better.  And I swear (this time I mean it for real!), I will never ever go there on a Friday or Saturday again.  You probably don't want to either.< /review>

<Text>My frist time reclying for cash
Here what you need to know..they don't want the cap on any thing ..2. They don't take anything with out the California redemption bar or code...for example wine and liquor bottles are a NO!
Most Bottles are clear or brown keep them separate. Park your vehicle then go get the garbage bin to put your recycling into separate them..push them up to the weight station..then go to the cashier for payment...must bring ID<//Text>< pictures>

I always have a great experience, they are very efficient and quick. It took me longer to put my recycle in the bins than it did going thru the line (1person) weighing it and then collecting my cash!
Awesome job everyone at Zarc.</text>

<rate>5</rate><review>I was there for the first time cause of 7 on your side and it’s the same as replant that they accept. But the showing your Identification part is new. And it’s faster with people driving to that place with cars. And grabbing bins to fill how much I have. And the lines faster too. Is not like replant recycling that the bins or only for the people up front. And also there’s 4 or 3 people there plus the lady giving the money. And it’s bigger then walking to replant. That place is even better then replant will more bins after emptying plastic bottles or glass or soda cans. The bins are back to other people to use. And any plastic bottles accept if it’s CRV. But no milk bottles.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Currently 1 of the few recycling places south of San Francisco.  Anticipate a long line of cars because they have limited parking spaces. They have an employee guide cars in 1 at a time.  Expect to wait 30-40 in your car, on a good day.  Once they let you in, their services are fast and efficient.<//review></record>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>So the employees that work there are great. Problem with the place is the line. Every1 who goes there to recycle bottles and cans should have their recycle separated before they get to zarcs. This is why there is always a line 15 cars deep at anytime of the day. If people had stuff separated before they entered lines would go faster, zarcs would make more money, and every1 would be happier. These easy changes could make this place great<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Great place to turn recycling, bottles, plastic, car batteries, etc. TIPs! segregate everything to get more money. Take apart the microwave, sell metal, power supply, motor, electric wire copper, etc. stainless steel is worth a lot. A stainless freezer is $600.  I picked up a fender and got $10. Only in America.< /Review>< pictures>

I always recycle copper and brass at Circossa metal in San Francisco. But I wanted to try a local place.
Well experience was mostly nice. Staff are frendly. If you have business licence, or contractor licence they will pay out right away, if not it’s a 3 day hold. Prices seemed a bit lower then my other place, but not going to SF makes up for it. Something I was not awere of: there is copper #3, for some reason they counted my waste as #3. While other places would always count it as #2.
So if you have under 200lbs bring it in, if you have way more Circossa might pay out more.
Good luck.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) They are very rats in the weight of what you carry, they steal you 😡 always a garbage they pay you always I recommend that you take great care in what you sell and see the weight and find out first how much the pound of each material is worth that you bandage a lot of eye

Bought a $1700 pair of rims, best part was there was NO alignment included with my purchase. Owner didn’t want to change my sensors out of my stock rims as well. To top it off RIMS HAVE BENT WITHIN 3 WEEKS. Don’t waste your money here.<//Review>

Wally was fantastic at helping us get our tires for our trailer Delivered to the store in one day! It only took 15 minutes to put all 4 tire on the rim. (We brought tires in off the trailer to make it more efficient)

If you’re looking for good customer service and great price, this is the place to go!

Thank you for all your help Wally at Tires 4 Less!!< /Text>

Literally, was the only tire shop to carry a specific tire that I was looking for or else I would have had to drive out of town just for one tire. They were able to order it AND put it on the following day.  If you need to be taken care of, then be sure to request Eric. The man is all about business and will ensure you receive the service you are looking for. Amazing job.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Awesome! Just awesome. We went and got financed for the new tires with warranty plus alignment and thought I need a alignment but didn't and they told me the truth! He didn't charge my spouse cause I didn't need it, and he even put hub caps (extra charge) on for us cause we asked him if he had any and they did. I will be going back for rim on my Honda Fit soon as I get the mechanical issue fixed, my tires bow outward a little bit and they told me that I wouldn't have even know if it wasn't for them and I'd just be buying tires after tires. I had just bought other tires a year ago and they were destroyed because of it and no one said a word at America Tires.<//Text>

Went in for tire balancing and the staff there was very informative and respectful.  Could be more for different vehicles but I got mine done for $10 a wheel.  Also rotated them for free because he noticed that the heavier wheels were in the front so he swapped them to the rears(maybe cause I was a first timer there).  No hidden fees or what so ever.  Probably the best deals in Merced!<//text>

They were professional and were able to get me going out the door with reasonable prices tires in no time. Other places were trying to charge me $50-150 more in total and they were going to have me wait for several hours to get the work done. Going back soon to get more work done soon!</Review>

<text>So I needed an oil change for my Mercedes and Mercedes was charging me $128 and said it would take 2 hours for a 40 minute job. Other places were wanting $100. So I went to Tires for Less because my brother got 4 tires from there for a really good price. They charged me $60 and they only took 35 minutes. I asked them if they could rotated my tires and check there air pressure and they did for free. Took about 1 hour, they are honest and nice. I'm definitely going back, and recommend this place. You will go and always go back!!!<//text>< username>

<Name>Cynthia Lynn<//Name><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>3</rate><Text>My apologies to the owner and employees of Tires 4 Less. The review I initially wrote misplaced blame for what I thought was a bad alignment job. When in fact, the issue was caused by my trust in F H & Sons Auto body and Paint. Whereas, I trusted that the work charged and paid for was completed, parts claimed to have been replaced were, and the parts reinstalled were done so  correctly. Wow, who would think a company could stoop so low? Tires 4 Less, my car drives straight as an arrow. Thank you.<//Text>< UserId.>

Go in for a patch, ended of paying for a new tire 80 dollars.  And they didn't tell me until I was paying. That cost them a customer. Shady.
Notice al the 5 stars come from fake profiles, all the real give not so good ratings.<//review>

As we told you, your thrust angle is off on the rear of your vehicle and as you know the trucks don not  have any adjustments on the rear, it causes “dog dragging” which pulls to left in your case.\n\nThank you again for your business.'}<//response>

<Text>This review is long overdue. The quality of the products is amazing. I have never received such quality of bud at such reasonable prices. The THC percent on some of it is crazy good. The customer service is the cherry on the cake of it all. I’ll keep spending my $$ here. Love you guys!< /Text>< date>

<Review>It was my first time. To be honest they were really busy and seems like employees are not enough.  But they are being nice when they take your order also, food and flower came out really quick.Light and music was chill. I think it's good place to chill w your friends.</Review>< Pics>

This establishment is Amazing. All of the staff are very friendly and helpful. They Produce and Package most of the inventory they have available. The Quality is most definitely there. I personally would come here any time of the day, they aren't busy and you'll never wait for more than five minutes.< /review>

One of my favorite places to go. You can catch me here dressed up on my way out or just chilling with tennis andA hat on. Finally a place where I'm not judged for what I enjoy doing. A little  aint gonna hurt nobody. Staff are on point very friendly and helpful.Food is , what more can you ask for? I hope it stays low key, my little hidden gem.</text>

Save your money folks. I was on time with my party of 4+, they took an hour to seat us. The weed is over priced and the food is mediocre. I suggest that everyone smokes in their car and goes to a fine dining restaurant. This will save you time and money.< /Review>

Having only discovered that this place existed near where I live I dropped in here for the first time for a quick dub in the morning, the budtender dude name Cal almost made me feel bad explaining so thoroughly for the under an eigth I was getting.
Certainly appreciated and miles better than unfriendly ones.
All the names of the strains are mostly some new unrecognizable ones nowadays so it's gotten a little more confusing since I'm used to more popular names like OG Kush, Louis XIII, and whatnot, but the strain he recommended is dank so I'm good with that.< /Text>

<Review>Always like coming here. Solid drinks. Favorite go to in the summer is the watermelon green tea. This time my popcorn chicken and squid were a little crusty and darker than usual, but the flavor was still good. Boba was a little to soft this time, which was disappoint, but went back the next day and it was good again. Teacup milk tea has a nice toasted marshmallow flavor and their boba was solid.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>The service was great! The venue was nice and clean as well. The boba, itself, was okay. I had the in-house brown sugar boba and it didn't have much taste and was a little softer than I like. At first, I thought it could have been the overpowering matcha tea, but it wasn't and I was disappointed. The tiramisu foam tea boba was great though.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNn0FBQktF41Z0O2rOMqtQLH-kFhQ5g_6rft8em=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNu7ayIKyvEV2OPM28ExI4QL7ma7w-ZSd5H9yAR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCqqbk1yvCLARuFLcDamItUVNfrKmgI-tArBMG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

<Response>None< /Response><text>The tea here is high quality - no comparison to chain stores that make their drinks from powder. They make everything fresh here. The shop itself is cute too! I highly recommend the hojincha milk tea with salted cheese foam, but all of the drinks are good.<//text></record>

This store is so cute and comfortable and they have a good variety of seating available. The milk tea is a good level of sweetness but once the ice even starts to melt, it becomes watery and lacks taste quickly. I ordered Thai tea milk tea and the boba had a funky taste similar to the devil's lettuce, which was disturbing. The employees were not very friendly, especially one who man who didn't smile until I tipped him.< /review>

<Text>I liked the sizes of the drinks and that there were some flavors most other boba places did not have. However, my strawberry banana blended boba was way too sweet and undrinkable. My boyfriend's coconut drink was fine.</Text>< pics>

<Text>I've now started to come here about every other Friday on average. I highly recommend following them on instagram @teacup_bobatea to check what special flavored boba they have on Fridays (+some holidays!!). Really gives me something to look forward to and a way to treat myself after a long week if the flavor intrigues me enough!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

The drinks are all different amount!!! It is not filled evenly. For the price, it is not worth it. The disappointment is immeasurable. There are better places out there who will serve and treat you better.<//Text>

Teacup milk tea and Thai milk tea was very delicious! The teacup milk tea has that marshmallow aftertaste which makes it so yummy!
Hope to have one near our area soon.<//text>

<Review>It used to be a great boba spot but since they've raised prices its basically $7 just for one cup! I can get two cups for that price basically everywhere else... The boba has gotten smushy and overpriced. I've also heard some pretty messed up rumors around how the workers are treated and about watery drinks 😕 theres lots of other boba spots in elk grove...no point in me supporting one that doesn't treat their customers well.</Review><rating>1</rating><Pics>None<//Pics>< user>

Their boba is decent but it’s too pricey for a cup of boba. It’s almost $7 whenever I buy and I don’t think it’s worth it that much. In addition to that, I hear that they add water to top off your boba if you don’t tip, and I really can taste that difference. For a $7 boba, I think that’s a jerk move, not worth the money and time.< /text>

Years ago, I used to jokingly say that a certain coffee brand could be found on every corner, but this actually seems to be the case when it comes to boba locations nowadays.

Well, while boba is a commonly found item in Elk Grove, boba that is made from scratch is not. I've been here numerous times: prior to their official opening, on their grand opening day, and many times after.

Customer service is always friendly. While their drinks are definitely on the pricier side to, I'm someone that believes in quality over quantity. The sizes of the cups are not as small as some as their competitors as well.

I was pretty sad that they replaced their Taro Sago flavor with Coconut Taro, but I've yet to be disappointed by any of their drinks. I usually stick to one or two flavors at a boba place, but at Teacup I can pick anything that sounds good to me and not regret it (so far). Out of all the drinks I've tried, my personal favorites are the Citrus Mango and Strawberry Fruit Tea.

Looking forward to trying more drink options and revisiting my favorites!< /text>

Use to like this place but their customer service isn’t great and They were supposed to be open til 10 yesterday but when I tried to walk in and get some boba they said they closed at 7:30...  but the doors were unlocked and on the site it said open. Very unpleasant</text>

<review>This place is not the most ideal for kids under the age of 10. There are parts of the play structure that are very challenging and involve big jumps from very up high. However there are swings and slides available for the youngins. The park does not have sand, it has wood chips. Benches for lunches and lots of grass. Basketball and a library</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJiD48GNH4hK1tS5EHtLfMHzkslyZx5pLFAsSN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6Bb51itap3vIKywTaktX8AjJlhBDWIuD1PonS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

wide open space, decent grass, though a lot of geese nowadays. There's also bike tools near the parking lot, which is super nice.</text>

This is a nice park. There are lots of people that use it for the basketball court and the swing sets and jungle gym. I've seen quite a few games of Sandman being played. The Parks and Rec staff keep close eyes on their kids, and the baseball field merges into other open areas as well as the paths along the surrounding waterways.
A library branch finishes the setup, making this a very nice public space.< /text>

the park is well-maintained and has a mix of shady/sunny and flat/mounded areas. there are a handful of picnic tables, but no grills.

the park is right next to mccartney street, and there is no fence, so you might choose to be concerned about your ball, frisbee, or child finding its way into traffic.<//Review>< Pics>

The grass is perfect for playing sports; no feces or many holes to fall in, having a picnic or napping if you prefer. The surroundings are safe with very little to no creepers. The basketball court is as smooth as it should be. Looks like a vety delightful park.</Text>

<review>A cute little park with a Tennis & basketball court, baseball diamond, a jungle gym and a small library. There are only a few picnic tables. But it is so close the Harbor Bay shopping center which has quite a few good restraunts. Also near the park are walking biking paths that run along a whole string of lagoons lined with flowers, willows, wooden bridges and water birds.</review><pics>None<//pics>< username>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Leydecker park, you're a family friend
Got ballers, kids, grass, but for parking you'll need to fend
The playground is nice, not too shabby
There's also a full basketball court in case you're flabby

This park is pretty nice.  Has a playground for kids, large round field for things like ultimate frisbee, has a full basketball court, and a softball field.  The only thing is, that if there's an event, good luck finding parking.  Parking can be tough to get without an event going on.  Otherwise, a nice park.  Just make sure kids cross the street safely around here.< /Review>< pictures>

Great facility, adhering to safety guidelines. Efficient and professional.</text>

The attention was really great and fast. Very organized. Troy was very courteous and attentive. The only complaint I have is the delay when I pick up the car. It took a good 20 mins to get it. But it isn’t a big deal. Everyone was super nice.< /text>

They pumped my tire pressure to 50 after a change of tire service. I trusted they know what’s best for my car until the tire literally exploded! I went to a tire shop and realize my tire pressure should be around 37-40!< /text>

<Review>The worst service l have experienced at a dealership!

Before you get a car everybody is so friendly and nice but after, not so much.

Every time I come here for something, I feel like I’m not welcome here and none of the problems Ive had with my car have not been fixed! And no one seems to know what they are doing here

Because of this experience, I’m leaving Mercedes and never coming back.<//Review><response>{'time': 1613548409532, 'text': "Hi, we are deeply disappointed by your experience at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek.

<Time>1623865830212</Time><rate>3< /rate><text>Got the car I wanted, but sat there for over 3 hrs even after doing everything short of contract signing online. Car was not ready, had damage I have to return to have fixed.
Biggest issue was the nitpicking on my trade in. Reduced their trade in number by $800 for thing as of yet not pointed out to me.  By itself I understood the $800 adjustment, but then expected that sort of detail to apply to the quality of detail on the one I was buying.  After looking longer at it after bringing it home found that was not the case.  Car wasn't even cleaned well and had things like lipstick still on the visor.  Center console was just plain dirty.  My trade was 3 yrs older but it was obvious that it had been better cared for and was in overall better condition.  I understand that a pre-owned car will have some issues, but if the one being traded is in better condition than the three year newer car it's being traded for, reducing of the trade value shouldn't happen unless you intend to give a reduction of the price of the purchased car for the same issues.
I'm considering returning it.< /text>< pics>

<name>Yunching Peng</name><Text>My husband and I experienced horrible service in this dealership. This dealership has the worst employees and worst technicians. We spent $1,200 to repair our windshield that was hit by a small rock. First, we have been told we have to wait for this "magical windshield," which was shipped from Europe, for almost 2 months (I can understand the covid thing makes everything harder than usual). Second, the advisor never makes a phone call or email to contact us. We need to follow up EVERYTHING by ourselves. Of course, it's hard to find someone to answer our questions every time. Our advisor always busy, never show up, and lazy.
Unfortunately, we had the same accident after two months. We decided to go to a local glass repair shop this time. Surprisingly, we found out that the windshield replaced at THIS MERCEDES DEALERSHIP IS FAKE ONE!!! Each windshield has a unique number; the official system shows that this does not match any number in the auto glass system. Moreover, this windshield is lighter, thinner and fragile than usual. Again, we waited for this "magical windshield," which was shipped from Europe, for almost 2 months!!! This is what we got!!! BE CAREFUL!!!

p.s. We just bought our car for about a year, which means finding a NORMAL material to fix it. It's not that hard. But, in this dealership, everything is hard and fake!!!<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

< Review>
First of all my wife was given the wrong information on cost of her service, from what was to be approx $300 ended up costing her $1500 advisor obviously provided what service it was supposed to be. After picking up her car the tire light came on as she got close to home so now she has to go back and have it checked. We attempted to fix by putting air in the tire that showed low but the light didn't go off.  Service has definitely declined. Will look for independent shop for next services.< /Review>

<Review>The review is for service and not for car. Every-time you come for service they will tell you your alignment is out and bill you $400 extra. I had that issue last  year too So this time I asked the service person (Ethan) to call me first before doing any extra service not covered with my service plan. First of all he didn't inform and second when asked told me that we discussed if needed we will perform the service. I was planning to upgrade the car so was planning not to do any extra service unless needed.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Susan S. is the best in handling all aspects of my MBZ service, since my purchase of the car.  I drive to dealer about 25 miles instead of just 3 miles (Autobahn Belmont) because of Susan’s great service.   From dropping of the car, service, loaner car and return drop off / pick up has been smooth so far.   So far, so good. 👏 👍</review>

<text>While my advisor is great the overall service and value are not. The car wasn't done in time to pick it up and the technician notes were useless to help the advisor tell me if more work was warranted or not or how severe the findings were. There were no staff readily available on Sat to pay and get the car back. The advisor said the car had been washed but clearly had not as the evidence of when I ran the wipers before drop off was exactly the same.  I am done using this site now that my pre-paid services are completed.</text>< time>

I and my wife bought a GLC-300 model in this store but the experience was very bad. When we were going to sign the contract the financial guy brought us to a room and presented many additional warranties and insurance to us including extended warranty, appearance insurance and windshield insurance, dent insurance etc. And they kept selling and push us to buy the insurance right away. Since the financial guy promised the appearance insurance can cover my car’s appearance including interior and exterior we purchased it. And the appearance insurance is combining the windshield insurance so they persuaded us to purchase both. It was a very pushy process and the process was only 10-15 minutes push us to buy the insurance and only left us 2 minutes to sign the car’s purchasing contract.. We were surprised at that moment because we supposed to complete the process of buying my car but the financial guy brought up many warranty packages suddenly. I really hate the way she was selling the insurance or warranty at that moment. Unfortunately, after I drove my car to home there was a scratch happened on my car’s rear. And we went back to the store to claim that scratch but the financial guy told us we could not claim that scratch because it was not covered. We were surprised again. We felt we were cheated so we wanted to cancel the insurance but the financial guy told us we could not cancel it. We were so frustrated and the whole process was like setting us up. I really don’t recommend this store if you want to buy Mercedes Benz.<//Text>

Overall I really like this place.  The woman who helps me, Giselle, is really cool and super helpful.  When I brought my car in I thought I would need to have my window fixed, it was having some issue with automatically rolling up, and my brake pads replaced because they were squeaking.  Both issues ended up being easily fixed and not costing me a dime, which is cool because as somebody who knows nothing about cars it would be easy to upsell me on whatever.

The one downside, and the reason this review isn't 5 stars, is that their loaner car system is a bit disorganized.  The people are friendly, but they always seem to be running behind and you'll usually end up waiting both to pick up and drop off your car if you're using a loaner.< /Text>

<Review>Steve Kirsky at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek is amazing!  I have worked with him for many years and can honestly say that when it came time to get another car part of the reason I decided on another Mercedes was because of Steve.  His professionalism, attention to detail, expertise and the convenience he provides are unsurpassed .  It's worth taking your car to MB of SC just to work with Steve-wherever you live!</Review></record>

<review>I brought in my E350 to resolve control center issues, like intermittent and random radio and back-up camera operations.  My advisor, Troy, who is always pleasant and courteous, could get me a loaner car, took care of the diagnosis, and personally handled a couple of other concerns I had.
Although I deferred fixing the problem the technician found out, I am very happy with this visit.<//review>< pictures>

My first time getting my GLE 300d serviced - very good experience from the on-line scheduling to picking up the car: performed the services required, implemented a recent recalls, made the adjustments requested to the sunroof. Very pleasant experience communicating with the service adviser - kept me up-to date all the time but not too much interaction. The car feels and drives like new!< /review>

He was patient and was willing to help. We immediately went to check out the car we were inquiring. He was helpful even in person. He kept checking on us. Gave us snacks and coffee. Luckily, we got approved for the car we want. Thanks to Tony for doing extra mile! We're so happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for car. Please give Tony a raise. He deserves it!< /Text>< Pics>

So unfortunately I had to bring my car in again. The service advisor told me the car started up fine for him???? (OK, its not like I like wasting my time bringing my car there). When he  investigated further he said he needed to change the battery, but because of COVID it was going to take a week or more.  So I left my car there.  When they called to tell me the car was fixed, I went and put a full tank of gas in their loaner and it was spotless!!! This is how they returned my car to me.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I have driven a Mercedes Benz since 1987 , the main reason I have continued to use the dealership in San Jose on Stevens Creek Rd, is due
the unparalleled service I receive from Charlie Fish my service advisor of  many years . My recent service took longer than what I had hoped for
however though not a fault of Charlie Fish . I would receive continued
updates throughout the day.
The  delays on the service and repair were strictly due to obtaining parts .
Lastly when I call to speak with Charlie he is always available or gets back to me quickly . He is truly the best !

My service advisor, Troy Schalk, is wonderful and knowledgeable and I appreciate his expert help with my car.  I would give him 10 stars if I could.

This is my 4th car from Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek.  Only reason I keep returning to this dealer is their outstanding service. I completely trust my advisor, Danny Ho to take care of my car.

My experience with your dealership is exceptional, especially with your sales team, Kenneth Nguyen.  Ken is very responsive before and after the purchase.  When I took delivery of a preowned car,, there were scratches in the rear bumper.  He assisted me getting the bumper scratches fixed with smooth transaction without charge to me.
Thank you Stevens Creek MB and sales team<//text>

Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek offers excellent service and customer care. The people made the difference. They are friendly, responsive, and informative. I never felt pushed or rushed, and all my questions and concerns were heard and addressed. John McCarthy and Nick Kith in particular were fantastic to work with. I really appreciate how well they took care of me. If you're interested in a Mercedes-Benz, I highly recommend you visit the Stevens Creek dealership!</review>

I took my E320 for wheel alignment. My Service Advisor, Charlie Fish, attended to me as quickly as he could despite something he was really tied-up with. Service was completed in 1.30 hours as promised while I waited in their lounge.< /Text>

TL;DR I brought my car here for a simple battery change service and ended up with a totaled car. I would not recommend coming to this dealership.

I brought my car to the dealership for a battery change. It took more than a month for them to complete the service. Given that the service was done during Covid-19, this delay was understandable. HOWEVER, when I went to pick up the car, I found that the flooring under the back passenger seats was completely flooded with water. The water had seeped through the panels and damaged the internal parts of the car. As a result, my car had to be totaled. Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek refused to take responsibility for this negligence. I will not be returning to this dealership and would highly discourage people from getting their cars serviced here.< /review>

Our sales person, Goran, was an incredible salesperson. His immense knowledge of these cars was such a help in making a difficult decision.  He made us feel totally at ease because of the integrity he showed in everything he told us. I am very grateful for the referral to him we received. I will always refer friends and family to him whenever they need similar assistance.
I was not happy with my experience with management there. I had made a phone call to ask a question and had been told that they would look into the question and get back to me within a half hour. No return phone call ever came. Also they were told while I was there that I'd like a response and still was ignored for the rest of the day.

Goran receives a 10 star rating from me. Management receives a zero. They are lucky Goran was there that day. He will always get my business in the future.

Tony Hieu Chiem with 17 years experience in Mercedes was a very pleasant sales representative with a lot of knowledge in the car industry. Glad we even had some jokes with him as well :) then we went to have a lunch together because were so hungry Lol
Tony helped me a lot to choose a car based on my budget and credit score. Also he knows how to treat clients by offering great deals! Recommended!< /text>

<Text>I have always gone to M-B of Stevens Creek to service my car. My advisor is Charlie Fish. I found his service excellent, responsive and timely. I would rate give it five-star.

<review>I just came in for an oil change and was charged $1,800.00 + I feel I been hustled, and as a 71 year old man, I put my confidence in these service tech MB of Steven Creek and do they do,  they take advantage of an old man hard of hearing and charge me extra for my van that is only a 2019 Sprinter hardly driven, but with 4+ recalls. nothing but narcissism upon narcissism in that service department. I called a MB private shop they Quoted $380.00 tops that I didn't need that extra work it a new van, they said I got robbed. MB should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of an old 71 year deaf man.</review><Rating>1<//Rating>< gmapID>

<Review>Dropped off the car for one day recall repair and the car stayed a whole week. Service technician test drove the car for 2 miles to check engine operation but instead, he/she changed A/C setting, seat adjustment, mirrors adjustment and steering adjustment. After receiving the car and and performing owner inspection under the hood, I found loose clamp on the intake hose that was left unchecked, and tied it down.</Review><gmap_id>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798<//gmap_id><name>Hassan Alhjouj</name><resp>None< /resp><Rate>2<//Rate></record>

<Review>Overall it was a bad experience. I had my windshield broken and needed to be replaced. At the beginning they didn't check the glass need to be ordered and there was no estimation of delivery due to COVID, they asked me to leave my car to them and gave me a loaner car (with a lots of dust inside). I drove the loaner for almost 2 weeks and I needed to keep calling back to them to check the status of the glass (they never gave me any updates during that time!). Finally I had to ask them to give the car back to me first.
Afterwards, I keep calling them to check the status of glass delivery. They never contact me although they said they will. Finally the glass was there and I made an appointment over the phone. However, when I showed up on my appointment, they could not find my name on the list. I am very sure that I went there at the correct time, but they kind of joked me on that to imply I remembered a wrong time for my service. At the end I need to put my car at the dealer overnight although they promised me at the beginning that the job can be done at the same day.
On the day I picked up my car, more crazy things happened that my m-benz APP kept telling me that my car battery became extremely bad (reaching critical condition) and they put the tire pressure ridiculous high as 52 psi (normal max. setting in manual is 43 psi). When I reflected these issues to them they just said as long as the alarming lights are not ON, you should be fine. However, I have never had this kind of experience at other dealer shop. And I need to pay extra time to make my car back in normal.
Although they did replaced my windshield successfully, the service representative was not honest on the situation and totally not responsible to the whole process. Also they don't take good care of your car after service and even put your tire or battery into improper conditions. Will not go back to this place again.

(updated after 4 months) Worst experience ever. I had a windshield replacement 4 months ago and the service was very bad at that moment. Surprisingly, my windshield was broken again just now and I was told that my windshield was much thinner and lighter than a normal windshield. Moreover, the auto glass technician cannot find the serial number of my broken windshield in the auto glass registration system! I doubt this Mercedes service center replaced me a fake and very low quality glass and charged me a high price. Very ridiculous and I will never visit this place again.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Taking a car in for service is like going to the dentist.  You don't want to but you need to.  And we treasure our advisor Jake Tran like we treasure a dentist that gives painless shots.  Jake verified our work order, called during the date with updates, brought in managers for approval as necessary.  In all, the whole experience was EXCELLENT.

Mercedes-Benz SUV GLE is my 4th German car, I had a couple of Audi before that were very good and I kept them for more than 6 years. I had a BMW X5 for 3 years and after my bad experience with BMW Stevens Creek dealership, for the first time, I purchased a Mercedes-Benz I anticipate that this review is not about the car since I had it for a week only, but about the dealership, I order this customized car 5 months ago from Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek where I found very professional and friendly staff I would like to acknowledge excellent work of John McCarthy and Jenna Morejon. If you have in mind to purchase a Mercedes-Benz I strongly recommend this dealership.< /Review>

Due to Covid-19 my SLC43 was driven less than 1,700 miles for the 1st service. Ethan was the service manager with quick and fancy talk. Without realizing he put alignment as part of the service. I didn't complain about steering nor the tire had any worn mark. Basically he is bilking. He left message that the alignment was out of the spec. B.S.! The alignment test sheet showed only two items that he considered out of spec: the rear toe was 0.13 when the spec is 0.34 +/- 0.14 (0.1 ~ 0.44, so within the spec), the front toe (pressed) was 0.14 when the spec is 0.09 +/- 0.05 (0.04 ~ 0.14, still within the spec). If you must bring your Mercedes to this place, make sure  you check every items before you sign. I would suggest choose other place for the service. Basically I paid over $900 for the oil-change.<//Review>

<Review>Have been a customer at this specific service center for over twenty years. For the first time I felt like they are making up for lost service opportunities. Service cost turned out to be 4x of what I had expected.

The service attitude and courtesy was still excellent. My advisor was highly professional and responsive. The loaner car worked very well for the number of days the car was in service.

I am a bit concerned about the process going forward snd would be open for  proposal on pre paid  maintenance plans. Thank you.<//Review><username>Ravi Ravikumar<//username><user_id>116438990281616819797<//user_id>< Time>

Went to see an RS5 for a good price -- lady on the phone knew I was travelling an hour to see the car, and we did a credit check before I arrived.

The car had clearly been in an undisclosed front accident. Passenger side of the hood dipped much lower and you could see the height difference clearly. Next to the poor fit from a head on collision was condensation from the passenger headlight, also from the undisclosed front end collision. The poor hood fit was also happening on the right side, but not as bad. Probably was hit on the passenger left side. Look closely around the headlight pic I took and you can see the passenger fender panel also mis-aligned, it is sticking over the headlight in a funky way. I included photos, unfortunately I didn't take photos of the hood mis-alignment, was in a rush and not planning to buy the car.

I started the car and it had a Differential fault. Engine bay had non-factory welds in it, plastic trim that was falling out, missing screws, absolutely embarrassing overall that Mercedes offered this car to the public in this condition. There was also a very old "clear bra" on the car, which you'd have to pay to remove, and it looked awful. None of this mentioned or viewable in the ad.

Basically they are counting on a buyer who is really clueless about cars or someone so overwhelmed with the idea of an RS5 that they overlook the front end issues -- some days the condensation I saw wouldn't be there.

Poorly repaired front accident cars have hidden expenses that will go on and on, and the front end can never really be fixed perfectly. It's basically buying a salvaged car that doesn't have the title. Someone hid this accident, probably was owned by someone affiliated by the dealership, then dumped on the public.

Summary: Car was advertised as having no accidents, none on the carfax, however visual inspection showed a clear, undisclosed front-end accident. 100% unmistakable that this car was in an accident and Mercedes is lying about it. If they can't spot the accident on this car, they should not be in business -- there's no way they don't know.

Scammers who wasted my day off, 2 hours in a car, and the cost of 2 Lyfts because I expected to buy the car -- It was a "reputable" dealership after all!</Review>

We had our newly purchased CPO vehicle serviced at MB of Stevens Creek and had a great experience. This was the first time back since our  previous service advisor retired and our new service advisor, Charlie Fish, was great.< /Review>

<Text>MB Stevens Creek provided excellent service when I recently purchased my pre-owned Mercedes.  They were very courteous, gave me a better price than that posted on the vehicle and provided helpful information to obtain refunds on warranties from my former vehicle.

Had a great experience at Mercedes Steven's Creek. Susan Sulimani was my service representative. She was polite and very thorough with assessing my issue. She emailed me with car information and satisfactorily completed my repair. I recommend her a high achievement for doing a great job.< /review>

I have been coming to this dealership since early 2007 when I purchased my first Mercedes E350  and have never been disappointed.  They are always keeping me informed and updated during the service process and have provided a courtesy loaner vehicle when needed.   Danny Ho has been my Service Advisor for the longest time and he along with the entire Service team have always performed at the highest professional level.  On this recent service visit Steve Kirksey helped me and  picked up where others have left off.....top notch.</text>

I purchased a car here with Tony Chiem and gotta say he was by far the best salesperson that i worked with.  He explained everything in detailed and gave me all the info needed for my purchase.  Even after the purchase I did txt him with several questions and got my answers back.  Most salesperson will ignore you after the purchase because there's no more incentive to do so, not the case with Tony Chiem!  Definitely recommend Tony if you are going to buy a mercedes here.<//Review>

This was my second purchase from Slava at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek, and he is very good to work with. He is a straight shooter, doesn't over sell, and tries to find what you are looking for. The first purchase I had to special order the car for the color/option combination I wanted, and the second time he found one close enough to my specifications. They have a good selection of AMGs. The service department is very good too.<//text>

We brought our older S-550 in for a tuneup.  But decided that it was time to get a new one. So we asked our service rep, Charlie Fish to introduce us to a salesman.  He introduced us to Bill Infald who was just great in understanding what we wanted and getting us the right new S-560.  He also spent lots of informative time with us to be sure that we understood how to use all the new updated features that came with this S-560.<//Text>

<Review>You should expect better, and more; after all we 're talking Mercedes Benz, right?  Well, they certainly delivered.  Mr Stephen Kirksey and his team were meticulous, responsive, understanding and resourceful.  I came in with a 4K miles' car (almost new!) that had a rattling sound in the dashboard that seemed only possible on a 104K miles car!  I was actually quite worried and bothered with my big purchase (I never owned a MB before).  They unassembled my AMG GLE 63S searching for that "cricket" and kept it longer than they had told me they would (which worried me even more), but they kept me informed and up to date with what was happening until they found a bunch of coins rattling in the inside of my car (I certainly do not know how they got there!).  I have a quiet, now truly pleasurable ride at last and what is best, although this kind of thing should've not been covered by warranty, like it or not those were my coins, they still covered the many hours of labor charging me nothing!  Customer Service is a dying breed, we all know that, but it is very refreshing to see that it still remains alive and well at Steven's Creek MB.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
My experience with Mercedes Benz at Stevens Creek has been good always, they are prompt in responding to the queries and help answer all the mechanical questions. This time and hopefully moving forward my service agent was Ethan Kurtz and he was very intelligent in walking me over the service details, mechanical functioning and kind enough to guide me on some of the payment plans. The Mercedes-Benz at Stevens Creek is a little on pricier side for servicing and everything but you get it done neatly. I would recommend anyone to Ethan Kurtz to be their service agent. Thank you.<//review>

< review>
Worst customer service ever. No one knows who’s doing what. You get put in voicemail and no one calls you back. Someone puts you on hold and get hung up on. We have called them to resolve an issue regarding a DMV that we don’t need to pay for As we already turned in the lease car. We have had over eight times called them and have not yet gotten this resolve this is probably taking us three hours of our time either on weight or calling back absolutely ridiculous.

This were an isolated incident I would definitely not even post. But this is actually the third time that I’ve called him about three different issues that no one knew how to handle and required multiple phone calls and one time I had to actually physically go down to the dealership  to resolve</review>

My experience with, and support from Rep John Stansberry was very positive.  My big disappointment and frustration was with the AEM recall modification and resulting issues it created with my Sprinter.   H2O in fuel indicator light(still lit) and it caused my fuel regulator failure.  $2,900.<//Text>

<Review>I brought my car in for issues with my battery traced to the MERCEDES BENZ "modular control system" = "radio".  Rather than fixing the "radio", it was REMOVED.  I apparently paid $1200 for removal of my radio and for a GAPING HOLE in the console of my car.   I also have to go elsewhere for a new "radio", estimated to cost at least $700.  My MERCEDES BENZ MODULAR CONTROL SYSTEM was working fine (pretty well) - WHY can it NOT BE FIXED by a LUXURY auto brand SERVICE CENTER for $1900 or LESS??!!

UPDATE:  Well, thank YOU, General Manager (and others) for helping to turn around my experience.  After some negotiation, I am VERY PLEASED with the outcome and am impressed that MBSC was willing to "go the extra mile" to accommodate me considering the restrictions imposed on it and other businesses by Santa Clara and other counties due to the "pandemic".< /Review><response>{'time': 1611681943589, 'text': "Hello, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback.

The advisor was supposed to leave the key by sales in after hours time, but this did not happen. Had to come back the next day to get my car picked up. Oh by the way, the rental gas is still your problem even that you filled it up the night before. Had to add a second round of gas for the extra round trip I had to do.

1st Class service. Technicians are thorough and technical. Make an appointment and a loner will be waiting for you to make your service experience seamless.

Update 1/20: Three suspension issues were corrected (rear-right and both left and right - fronts); however, the left rear air suspension failed within a month after getting the full suspension checked (the main reason why I brought the vehicle in for service). I ended up having to bring it back and have that replaced as well.

Troy Schaulk and the team gets kudos for this review.</Review>

Great service started at the door, was greeted with a smile by Mr. Jay Falkner, the assistant service manager, the car was done earlier than the promised time. He went beyond and above and delivered the vehicle with the repair needed and thrown in a free vehicle inspection and free car wash.

I feel lied to. I purchased a vehicle a few months ago. Somehow, when it was being detailed, they damaged the car. I arrived, ready to purchase, until I saw this new damage. They confirmed it happened while being detailed. Not only did Ken, my salesperson, promise to buy the new part and replace it, his manager came over and agreed he'd put the order in. Well, 2 months later, brush offs and changing stories, they finally tell me the store manager should have had the final word and he would not be replacing the part and would not allow me to have it fixed at my local autonation. They said I had to drive 3 hours back to theirs! So, I feel very lied to, just to make a sale.</Text>

If it wasn’t for the constant information given back to me from the service consultant, keeping me well informed about what was the delay in getting my car back this would have been a two and not four.

But; overall it was ok ! Only because I work from home, and didn’t need the car until the weekend.

Even the pickup of the car was a disappointing experience. Waited an additional hour on a Friday before picking up because I was told the wash of the vehicle would be ready by 4:00pm. It wasn’t. I took it unwashed because the alternative was come back at 5:15pm. They close at 5:30.

But the final work looks good. The additional wheel alignment was done on top of the airbag recall. That all looks good.< /text>

<review>My service advisor, John, deserves 5 stars. Dropping off the car took a bit longer than expected due to many cars in the queue ( I got there ~7 minutes prior to my appointment). Once the line cleared, check-in process was easy, and the service advisor took very good care of me.
I'd used Smythe to service my car routinely - they even replaced the transmission. I went to an independent shop once the dealership changed ownership.
This was the second time I had my car serviced at Mercedes of Stevens Creek - both major. One to fix the convertible top mechanism that was stuck in the open position, and most recently, to fix the driver's seat motor. Both times, the car came back worse than when I took it in.
In the process of fixing the convertible top mechanism, they manage to rip the top (it was the original top); however, since I took the car in with the top in the open position, I could not prove the dealership had damaged it. I replaced the top subsequently.
The most recent service included the seat motor replacement, new tires, 4 wheel alignment, suspension work, and new steering shock. After the service, I can feel a distinct vibration in steering where there was none previously. I took it back to the dealership. Again the service advisor took very good care of me. He had the shop foreman check out the car, and rebalance the tires, re-check all the work, tighten everything to spec. He told me this is pretty much everything that can be done. I noted the vibration is still present; he maintains this is normal for the car (it is not based on my experience prior to the service). It feels like at least one of the tires may be out of round.
-------------------------
Update March 18, 2021: MB of Stevens Creek contacted me and asked to bring the car back. They replaced the tire that was out of round and rechecked the other related items. The ride is improved. I'm very happy with their customer service.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
DONT GO HERE.

People here looks nice. And very welcoming. But that's it. I scheduled an annual maintainance and come to pick up when i received a call from them.

When I arrived,they first fail to know where the car is. They took me around and gave me a "Tour" in their garage.

After wasting my 15 mins, they found my car, unwashed, after the full maintenance. So I have to wait for another 20 mins to finally get my car back, with the water stain still there. You can tell how careless they are doing there.

And during the waiting, no one care about us here and the first reception just left with “They will find ur car”. And not a single person says “sorry”.

So I just deserve to wait here for almost 1 hour to just pick up my car.

Won’t come back here again.< /Review>

Jim is the best sales I have ever met ! He was able to get what I wanted with the price and the car I wanted so promptly! Also the finance guy Dusan ( forgive me if I spelled wrong haha) is also very funny guy we cracked a lot jokes! Also thanks to Chris the sales GM got me the deal and made sure I was happy to drive my car away ! I am ready to start a new chapter of life with my new A220! Highly recommend Jim!!!</review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>We leased two cars with Fletcher Jones for 6 years in the past and obviously went back to them for a new lease. The agent who helped us in the past was retired and the new agent didn't meet our expectation. We looked around and stopped by here in Stevens Creek. Talked to a young nice gentleman which was very helpful and then he passed us to Solmaz, a very nice lady who tried to find what we were looking for. Even though there was an issue at the beginning with a recall on the new leased car but the Stevens Creek team including Kevin, Store Manager (I believe), Chris, Sales Manager, Aaron, Finance and Solmaz helped to resolve the issue and keep us happy and satisfied with the service. Thank you and keep up on the team work.<//Text>< Pics>

Grateful for service help.  We have had our MBZ vehicles serviced here for many years.  They have helped with some really perplexing issues.  I have been trying to find out problems with my lane control and service has been relentless in trying to find the issue.  This review is about the help in resolving an issue with rodent damage that was hidden and tricky to  find.  Thank you Susan Sulimani for getting me answers.  Car issues can be very frustrating and Susan has been patient with my whining! Thank you MBZ service.<//Text>

<Text>Got helped by Jake Tran. He has been really helpful and one of the best customer service representatives i have come across at Mercedes-Benz. He made sure that i got all the car service requirements fulfilled and in the least possible time. Jake surely deserves to get a more challenging customer facing role as he definitely knows the skills to win customers. I wish he had been there in the sales department so i didn't have to go to Walnut Creek to get my GLS 450 2020.<//Text>< pics>

I have been visiting MB of Stevens Creek for past 5 years, but the last servicing experience was particularly poor.
To begin with with I was handed over an estimate of 670 /wo taxes when I scheduled my servicing, however when I reached there the agent told me that the car is eligible for 70K/7yr servicing (even if there were only 60K miles, and it was just over 6+ yr) and hence * I would have to * take the 70K/7yr service AND also change the transmission fluids. I tried to ask him if I can reduce some optional components of the service to reduce my bill, but he flatly denied and told me that unless I do all that he is mentioning, they will not reset the service indicator on the car. So I agreed to get 70K/7yr service and transmission fluid change.
When I finally came to pick up my car, I was surprised to find that they had billed me +$1200, and included additional charges for even things as trivial as +$6 for remote battery (just to note, I don't mind this, but in all previous years, almost all 5 servicing, the service-assistants have been kind enough to do this without charging), and it included several other replacement charges and coolant charges...
I tried to ask more details about $700+ charge which said 70K/7yr service, but there was no one to explain the components of that service. I was surprised that besides the 70K/7yr service they had charged so many other additional charges...
I have been coming to MB of Stevens Creek every year, but this time I felt that the overall experience was poor and attitude of the service specialist was not very welcoming. Hence the low rating. I hope someone pays attention to this.< /review>

<review>I got an appointment for the air bag recall on my car at the Mercedes Service Center on Stevens Creek. I showed up at the appointed time and was told it would take a couple of hours. After 2.5 hours, I was told they didn’t have the air bag module and I would need to re-schedule.
I received a voice message later saying that there was a shortage, and they would let me know by May.
I called a service center the next day, referred by my mechanic, and was told to bring the car in for immediate service. Apparently, there is no shortage for recalls.
I found the treatment at the Mercedes Stevens Creek Service center very unprofessional and inconsiderate.<//review>< pics>

After moving from Portland, this has been my go to dealership for new Mercedes vehicles and servicing my in warranty older vehicles. They are expensive and suggest expensive repair services on older vehicles and dealer extended warranties like any other dealership but they are far less pushy than other car dealers (based on general experiences that people have at car dealerships). All in all, I don't mind going to them for parts, services, repairs and new vehicles.</Review>< Rating>

I brought my GLS 63 in for routine annual service.  My service advisor, Susan Sulimani met me there.  She had helped me out during my previous visit and again she provided exceptional attention to my appointment this time.  My vehicle needed new rear brakes and I had coverage through a protection program.   Susan contacted them to ensure the repair was covered and it took no effort on my part.  The facility was organized and efficient while adhering to COVID protocols.
Very much appreciated!< /review>

<Review>Our (my wife and I) overall experience at the Stevens Creek Mercedes-Benz dealership was very good. They are really motivated to get your business if you make an informed & mutually win-win offer (vs ripping you off).

The only reason for 4 STARS vs 5 STARS is that due to a certain misunderstanding, we lost the first vehicle that we were interested in. In going back and forth on the lease discussion with the Sales person, the actual numbers (MF, RV...) on the lease were not provided early on in the discussion which resulted in us walking. It was only after few days speaking with Chris (their senior manager) that we understood the disconnect in our numbers vs theirs. By then the vehicle was sold. The second time around we met with Basir Ahmadi via Val and we closed the deal in 30 minutes. Basir Ahmadi went out of his way to ensure that we were treated well. We even left our vehicle in their lot for a week as we drove with the new vehicle and came back a week later to pick up our existing vehicle.

Our experience with Moshtaba, the finance person was also very good. We did not experience sales pressure for unwanted items. He even went out of his way to get us a great deal on the pre-paid maintenance and permaplate warranty as part of our lease agreement.

In summary, we strongly recommend this dealership and we would again provide our business to Stevens Creek dealership when opportunity arises. Chris, Val, Basir Ahmadi and Moshtaba are the folks that we interacted with during our second round of engagement. Thank you.<//Review>< name>

This is a super easy dealership to work with for servicing of my car.  I've been with them for over 20 years.  I was recently helped by John Stansberry and he was outstanding providing after hours email response.  The invoice was sent ahead of time and could be paid online reducing the time needed to spend at the dealership for pickup.</Text>

Worst service ever. Left my GLC Coupe (still under warranty) for 48 hours to fix a few issues including the eco start not working anymore. Bad if not barely no communication during the period and at the end nobody looked at the car in 2 days. Had to pick it up on the 3rd day in the same state...<//review>

The service experience was perfectly fine, albeit expensive (of course).  However, after the service they chose to hound me for a review like a dog digging for a bone, which isn't cool.  I'll accept one request, but more than that is just badgering the customer, and that isn't very Mercedes like.< /review>

I had an issue with my cars steering wheel and had my warranty but due to not only covid but my fiancé being severely I was unable to take my car in a timely matter, when I called Mercedes Benz I was assisted by Rodrigo and was told that I unfortunately when over my mileage by 4K I take constant trips to Stanford from hollister so I didn’t realize how fast I would pass my mileage, I explained my situation to Rodrigo and not only was he super understanding he went out of his way to call Mercedes Benz directly and was able to have them allow me to use my warranty which due to my circumstances was just amazing , I loved that he’s treated me as a human bean and not a number he remembered my situation and quickly got me the loner car which allowed me to see my fiancé at Stanford. Lastly when he called to tell me that my vehicle was ready I was pleasantly surprised that he remembered my fiancé and asked for he’s well being which was very nice of him to ask it shows compassion and empathy Thank you Rodrigo for making this experience as pleasant and smooth as possible !!!<//Review>

<Review>Appointment was super-easy (online) however, was disappointed that the dealership was unable to re-flash" the memory on my car's computer/nav system. Spent ~3 hours waiting to have this updated to only find they could not figure out what would seems a pretty straight-forward upgrade.</Review>< pictures>

Second bad experience with this dealer. My Mercedes battery keeps dying. So unfortunately I had to bring my car in again. The service advisor told me the car started up fine for him???? (OK, its not like I like wasting my time bringing my car there). When he  investigated further he said he needed to change the battery, but because of COVID it was going to take a week or more.  So I left my car there.  When they called to tell me the car was fixed, I went and put a full tank of gas in their loaner and it was spotless!!! This is how they returned my car to me.< /Text>

Thank you to Nate Jones for helping me on my first service appointment at MB Stevens Creek.  He was personable and accommodated all my requests.  He was upfront that he may not get my car into the detail shop, but said he would try.  I had a slight stain on the interior roof of my car and didn't notice it till after purchasing it.  He was able to get the stain out that day and I couldn't be happier.  THANKS AGAIN Nate for your help and I look forward to your assistance again on my next appointment.</text>

My salesmen Jugbhir Singh was fantastic, Aaron Riddle in finance was amazing. Both of them made my experience at stevens creek great. I’ve been to many Mercedes Benz dealerships, my favorite has always been Stevens Creek. This is my second purchase from them. I highly recommend this dealership to anyone that is seeking a Mercedes vehicle. I highly recommend these two gentlemen, it will only make your experience even better. Once again thank you guys and stevens creek.</Review>

Second purchase in three years and both have been awesome. Bill is very knowledgeable about what he is selling. He went out of his way to pick up my car from the tire shop because I was leaving out of town and returning a leased car. Long story short it needed new tires but bill took care of everything and ordered a new car for my wife’s birthday. We arrived from Vegas and he had what he promised and more! Who does that!
Well let me tell you Bill he takes his time end not ounce did I feel like I was at a used car lot.

Thank you Bill

<Review>I usually don't buy new cars from dealers but this guy Basir, made it super easy for me to decide on the first visit. even though i took 2 visits to finalize but that was because i wasn't open to buying from the dealer.

On March 5/ 2021 we purchased our new car.  Solmaz was our sale person. She was very helpful.  Very happy with Safi Hatoum as a sales
manger. We didn't find Mr Afshar very professional.
There was a discrepancy between the amount of money he charged us on the day of purchase verses what it was on the certificate for 4 years prepaid maintenance. When I questioned him he said it was a typo!!!!!

The sales person Tony Cardinale was not very helpful.  He did not listen, would not help with financing and dragged out the process for a couple of hours.  What could have been accomplished in 2 hours took over 4 hours.  Had sales manager Chris not stepped in to help with financing, we would not have bought the car.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>My wife and I had the best experience purchasing a new car at a dealership that we have ever had in more than 40 years. Like most people, we dread going to a dealer as they play games to make you wait for them to "evaluate" your offer, and then come back and make you feel bad for wanting to get a good price. Not with Slava Aprelenko at MB of Stevens Creek. From the first time we met with him and he walked us through the ordering process because the model we wanted was not in stock, he was honest and open and recommended a few items that we should consider, and for other ones, said we really didn't need that feature. He gave us a very fair quote and then kept us appraised of the delivery process, always making sure that we were still feeling good about the order. When it finally arrived he spent quite a bit of time with us to make sure we really liked the car and wanted to complete the deal. He then spent over an hour with me explaining all the features. After that, we met Dusan Golomeio, who did all the paperwork and contract information. Dusan was just as helpful and honest as Slava, and by the time we were done with the transaction, we were not wiped out and feeling dirty. We will absolutely be back to purchase other vehicles from Slava and Dusan, and highly recommend them and MB of Stevens Creek as a great way to purchase a car, and get a very fair deal.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I usually don't buy new cars from dealers but this guy Basir, made it super easy for me to decide on the first visit. even though i took 2 visits to finalize but that was because i wasn't open to buying from the dealer. The advice and the service from Basir was excellent. He was very patient and provided all answers to our questions very clearly.
Highly recommend dealing with him if you are looking to visit this place</Text>

Love coming in for service. Danny takes great car of me when I bring in one of my 4 Mercedes Benzes. It's so nice to have someone you can call who knows you and your cars .I enjoy the personal touch to the service department. Came in for a recall repair and is was taken care efficiently. Thanks again.<//review>

The sales person Tony Cardinale was not very helpful.  He did not listen, would not help with financing and dragged out the process for a couple of hours.  What could have been accomplished in 2 hours took over 4 hours.  Had sales manager Chris not stepped in to help with financing, we would not have bought the car.</Review>

I have always had a great experience at the location and it has kept me coming back for years. On the verge of leaving and finding a new dealer this last time, management worked to help correct the issue that i was having and ultimately saved me as a customer. I would highly recommend this dealership

What a pleasant surprise...  I am 60yo and have purchased many many vehicles from both Dealerships as well as Private parties.  And I have to say this was the BEST Buying experience ever.  I Purchased a very inexpensive car but the Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek dealership treated me as if I was buying one of their Top of the Line automobiles.

The Salesperson Jim Chassebi  was so patient with me and my daughter.  It was her first purchase and she was both excided and nervous at the same time. She's heading off to Nursing School and  Jim wanted to make sure she had a safe and reliable car... He was awesome.  We felt no pressure and a sense of calmness and casualness. I have already told almost a dozen of my friends about the AutoNation Experience and especially that of Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek.

I don't normally give 5 stars in reviews, because I believe they should be reserved for the Very Very Best performance.  But I just can't think of AutoNation and Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek doing anything more to satisfy their customers.

sincerly,

Joe K.

The service is quick and friendly. But there is room for improvement, if the seat cover can be used when delivering the vehicle to customer, and some sanitization can be applied on the steering wheel, especially during the pandemic< /text>

< Review>
I had an excellent experience at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek.

I worked with Sales Consultant Basir Ahmadi who later brought in the General Sales Manager Christopher Hong.

Both Basir and Christopher were professional, friendly and helped me come to a decision that put me in a fabulous car at a price and agreement that I felt comfortable and happy with. I cannot say enough good things about these two genuinely great humans!

I highly recommend requesting either of these two for your sales needs.

The team members I met in finance only added to my great experience.

The knowledgeable and kind Sean Shah took the time to help me understand aspects of my finance agreement in such a clear easy way to understand.

I then met with Moe Afschar to go over and sign  the final paperwork. Moe assisted me in my understanding of the various warranties and protections available to me. He explained the paperwork with extreme clarity and was committed to addressing my questions during the process.

Assisted by Moe’s excellent communication skills, knowledge of products policies and finance we were able to successfully complete my paperwork in a breeze.

If you’re headed to Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek I hope that you have an experience as wonderful as mine was and are able to work with at least one of the team members I mentioned in my review 😊

***UPDATE: SERVICE DEPARTMENT***

Shout out to my Service Representative Ethan Kurtz! He’s the best! I don’t know quite how to sum it up, but request him as your Service Representative and you will get why I say he’s the best.

Ethan’s work ethic is tops! He is thorough and quick: Quick to respond, quick to evaluate the issue at hand, thorough in explaining the issue and how to solve it.

On top of the great professionalism I’ve experienced at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek by Ethan, he is such a nice person!

Ethan’s genuine kindness and professionalism are the reason why I will continue to have my car services done at MB of Stevens Creek even though I will be moving closer to a different dealership.

I figure the caliber of work as far as mechanics etc are all up to the MB standard, but finding a great service representative is hit or miss.

I hope Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek is able to recognize a gem like Ethan Kurtz!</Review>

What a pleasant surprise...  I am 60yo and have purchased many many vehicles from both Dealerships as well as Private parties.  And I have to say this was the BEST Buying experience ever.  I Purchased a very inexpensive car but the Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek dealership treated me as if I was buying one of their Top of the Line automobiles.

The Salesperson Jim Chassebi  was so patient with me and my daughter.  It was her first purchase and she was both excided and nervous at the same time. She's heading off to Nursing School and  Jim wanted to make sure she had a safe and reliable car... He was awesome.  We felt no pressure and a sense of calmness and casualness. I have already told almost a dozen of my friends about the AutoNation Experience and especially that of Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek.

I don't normally give 5 stars in reviews, because I believe they should be reserved for the Very Very Best performance.  But I just can't think of AutoNation and Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek doing anything more to satisfy their customers.

sincerly,

Joe K.

Mercedes Benz at Steven's Creek is by far the best place to buy, lease, service your Mercedes Benz. I've had great experience working with Jim duffer, Mark Arnold and others in the service and lease renewal teams.

The service is often prompt, the supervisors keep you posted on the progress and the place also has a good waiting area in case one needs to spend a few hours working from there while the car gets done.<//Text>

Overall, the service performed was good. The amount was incredibly excessive and most not necessary.
My service agent was Angela and she was exceptional. The driver that delivered my vehicle could not have been better and more personable. The people I dealt with were fantastic.
I have owned Mercedes Benz since 1992 covering nine different models. I have worked for Mercedes Benz and have always loved their vehicles. However since now the price gouging on service has driven me away to Tesla. I am now down to my last Mercedes I’ll ever own or gas powered car I’ll ever own. I have ZERO maintenance and Tesla keeps improving with constant free software updates. When was the last time you owned a car that improved with age?<//Review>

I had a simple service appointment to which I showed up on time, but I had to wait over 30 minutes for the service advisor to come to my car to write up the order. It was not a busy time. Once I was finally signed in, I chose to wait for my car to be serviced, because it should be relatively quick. After a reasonable time, the service advisor advised me my car was getting washed and would be brought up in about 5-10 minutes. Good, things were looking up. I was instructed my car would be brought up at the end of the service aisle where I should wait. After more than 20 minutes passed standing outside waiting, I approached the counter and asked the counter man again what was the delay? He checked the computer again and informed me my service advisor must have forgotten to tell them to bring up the car. It was parked in the garage. It took him another 10 minutes to walk out to wherever the car was to bring it up. That meant I wasted at least another 30 minutes just waiting after the service was complete. In total, MB wasted my time for over an hour. I was even told when I voiced my displeasure at the disrespect I endured that, "sometimes it takes longer when customers choose to wait!" On what planet does that make sense?</text>

I have purchased my Mercedes from this dealer and have had one of worst customer service experiences of my entire life. Sales rep pushed on convincing me to buy their warrantee package despite my husband not wanting it and finally he sold it to us as he mentioned after certain time it is peace of cake to cancel and get refunded. Since the time came for requesting cancellation it has been 100% disaster, none of my so many emails and calls have been responded to and 3 months passed cancelation date I have not been refunded. Sales keep ignoring my follow up calls and emails which pushes me to go for an in person visit in this COVID time! Would never ever receive anymore services from them. I wish I could give them zero star!<//Text>

My sunglass holder fell out upon trying to use it for the first time. I called Asad, the salesman that sold me the car in November and he never returned my call. I set up an appt. to have it re-installed and when I arrived (early) I was told by Nate Jones that the tech wouldn't be able to even look at it for 2 1/2 hours. I live in Gilroy and didn't want to drive all the way back up again so I waited.  I was then told it would be $924.83 to replace it.<//Review>

Since the time came for requesting cancellation it has been 100% disaster, none of my so many emails and calls have been responded to and 3 months passed cancelation date I have not been refunded. Sales keep ignoring my follow up calls and emails which pushes me to go for an in person visit in this COVID time! Would never ever receive anymore services from them. I wish I could give them zero star!</Text>< pictures>

Nice car and I appreciate the fact that they did a complete brake job and put new tires on the car when I commented it didn't stop very quickly.   This meant a lot to me and I appreciate it.
I would have given a 5 star review but I was initially told on the phone that there was a 90 day warranty then I found out there wasn't one... so that didn't make me happy... but I had the car checked at Ricks Mercedes in Scotts Valley and Rick and Willy my trusted mechanics said I lucked out and the car is in excellent shape.
All in all, the management was very responsive and I would buy another car here in the future.< /text>< username>

We're Audi owners, used to own Mercedes in the late 80s and early 90s. Since there's no high line EV's except the B class and i3, we found our 2015 B class here on Auto trader for our mother. Slava was a great sales consultant, professional, patient and extremely knowledgeable about MBZ. We went back 3 times before we made our decision to purchase the car. Yes, I wore shorts and t-shirt and Slava still let me to test drive the car LOL. Since it's a used 1 price car, no negotiation or anything like that, everything went peacefully and stress-less. One thing wasn't done correctly was the day running lights were turned off, and when we came home to turn it on, one wasn't on, we had to bring it back for fixing. Troy was nice to take care of it, but this should happen if the technician who smog and safety this car did his job correctly, to me, I felt cheated regardless if it's an honest mistake, but all day running lights should be turned on. Anyhow, due to Slava and Troy performance, I still give 5 stars. For other customers, make sure to turn on everything before taking delivery, yes, it's under warranty, but taking it back, waiting for service is totally uncalled for.<//text>

<text>Unfortunately I am not totally satisfied with their service. I took the car to service to fix the passenger sit and to look at the navigation SD card that was stuck. My first appointment was canceled because they scheduled me with the wrong person. And when they finally received me they were only able to fix the passenger sit. The SD card they tried to take it out by inserting another metal which got stuck too now that metal is hanging out of the SD entrance. Now it looks horrible.
They just said they couldn’t remove it because in order to fix it they needed to remove the whole thing and it wasn’t approved.</text><user>104124086665050671961< /user><response>{'time': 1605302432466, 'text': "Thanks for the feedback, Yareli.

Excellent customer service(sales & service dept) however, if you call the main line or try to reach the finance department, grab a cup of coffee, it's going to be a while.  Due to those two factors, I'm giving it 3 stars.  If those two factors didn't exist, I'd give it 5 stars.< /Review>

The gold 2002 is my first Mercedes. The car performed so well and the service at Mercedes Benz dealerships was always head and shoulders above all others that I decided to continue my experiences with MBUSA! I have bought two since then. One from MB OF PLEASANTON where Joe Manifesto was my salesman and my most recent from MB OF STEVENS CREEK. Mark Arnold is my salesman and continues to be my point of contact. I got such great car care from MB OF STOCKTON and i will continue taking my car there because Mercedes Benz doesn't care where you bought your car, everywhere gives you great care.

<text>Very expensive service without commensurate quality of service. Just spent $2,000 on service and they say they want another $2,100 to replace the entire intake manifold due to a plastic part wearing out. There are no messages on the dash and the car drives very well so I declined.

I had a battery drain issue, had to replace the battery twice in 2 months. After 3 days of diagnosis they couldn’t find any issue. Of course I had to pay for the diagnosis regardless. Now 10 days later the battery is dead again. A few years ago when they put in a new battery I now discovered that they omitted the vent tube so the gases of the battery can go outside the hood. No wonder I had weird smells inside the car since the inlet for outside air is right on top of the battery. This was discovered by the AAA guy who came and replaced the dead Mercedes battery.

Another issue cropped up after the last service. The technician damaged the left hood strut so now when I open the hood it doesn’t stay up. It was fine right before I took it in. I know that because I opened the hood to jump start the battery.

They used to be a lot better and more reasonable before. I had been servicing 3 cars for the last 15 years there. Now it’s all about how they can charge more and more. I think the good mechanics are gone and there is a lot of pressure from management for revenue. Terrible.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Great Service at this dealership! Guys are professionals, went above and beyond my car after it got over 100k miles mark. Some other Unofficial Mercedes service I was going to before kept saying that the car is in great condition, while in reality there were a few flows that I could feel - that’s why I went to official Mercedes Service at dealership. There were few things that should have been done at 70k miles for my car, but it was not done neither by previous owner nor by folks on the previous places where I was doing service.

So only official service from now on, it has much cheaper outcome in a long run, than not fixing what needs to be fixed and screw the car completely with some incompetent folks elsewhere! Great job!< /Review>

<review>It was very easy to make an appointment by phone to have a service for my E350,  including arranging for a loaner car. The day I brought my car in for service I met Charlie Fish who had been assigned as the service adviser. Charlie explained what needed to be done for the B service and told me about a package I could purchase for 3 services which would save me quite a bit of money. Charlie is the  best service adviser i have had in all the years  my car has been serviced at Mercedes dealerships.  My car was ready when promised,  washed, tires at 39 psi as I requested. The   people at the service department are very pleasant and efficient, and I highly recommend the place.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>We're Audi owners, used to own Mercedes in the late 80s and early 90s. Since there's no high line EV's except the B class and i3, we found our 2015 B class here on Auto trader for our mother. Slava was a great sales consultant, professional, patient and extremely knowledgeable about MBZ. We went back 3 times before we made our decision to purchase the car. Yes, I wore shorts and t-shirt and Slava still let me to test drive the car LOL. Since it's a used 1 price car, no negotiation or anything like that, everything went peacefully and stress-less. One thing wasn't done correctly was the day running lights were turned off, and when we came home to turn it on, one wasn't on, we had to bring it back for fixing. Troy was nice to take care of it, but this should happen if the technician who smog and safety this car did his job correctly, to me, I felt cheated regardless if it's an honest mistake, but all day running lights should be turned on. Anyhow, due to Slava and Troy performance, I still give 5 stars. For other customers, make sure to turn on everything before taking delivery, yes, it's under warranty, but taking it back, waiting for service is totally uncalled for.< /Text>< rate>

I was very happy with the communication I received, especially having my car towed from another shop that had my car for over 2 weeks and I received hardly any communication from them. However, I was a little disappointed to show up and my car had not been washed. I was told it already had been washed the previous week & they would even wash it again before I showed up. It was clearly never washed so I had to ask for it to be washed and wait 20 minutes. If I just paid $1,600 in repairs I would think this would be automatic and something I shouldn’t have to ask/wait for.

Now I know going to a dealership I’m expected to pay a higher price but I was quoted $98 for windshield wipers that I was told would be discounted when I got the bill. I was billed the $98. And then I was quoted $70 to replace a light bulb that I had fixed for free at a different shop the same day. I don’t mind paying the extra money at the dealership because I typically feel like I can trust their work, however I’m not so sure after this experience.<//Text>

<Review>We had a great experience at the SC MB Dealership. This was our 2nd Mercedes in a span of 4 months. Our Sales SPOC- Slava was committed and entirely vested in the search and finalization for the new car. He helped put the new config for us in the build making sure it was as per our wish. But the wait for the new car was longer than anticipated and hence when there was new inventory, we decided to choose from that. Slava was there at the door at the scheduled time. He ensured our time was used wisely. Based on our preferences for the desired model, he lined up the vehicles for the test rides.
And whenever there's a question for a feature, Slava makes sure to follow-it up with a mini feature video and share with me (before and after sales as well).

I'd recommend this dealership and Slava any day for your purchase, which you won't regret.</Review><Time>1620755968496</Time></record>

The service here is outstanding.  My advisor, Susan, is very thorough and remembers (or reviews) past visits so she is able to recommend what should be done.  My car is 5 years old, and it feels like new.  The entire operation is very efficient, I get in and out quickly with a clean loaner car, which the last time I had for 5 days due to a cracked windshield repair and a damaged rocker panel.<//text>

< Review>
I had 40K mile service at the Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek. My experience was good. Battery was low and replaced free of charge from factory warranty. Still squeaking noise in reverse (when cold) is not taken care. It must be a design flaw at Mercedes. No solution except replacing brake pad?</Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><userid>111131628564489396799</userid><Text>This review is for the service department. I had a flat tire that needed to be replaced so I scheduled my first service here and had a bad experience. The clerk who helped me schedule over the phone emailed me the appointment confirmation but they got the tire size wrong so I had to call back and ask them to change it.

I came on the day of my appointment to find out my tire wasn't even there yet..and no one called me to let me know before I got there. They told me the tire will be there later that day so I can either wait or come back.

I asked them for a loaner car but they said since the service will only take 1-2 hrs, they cannot provide a loaner car. I can't believe they didn't even give me a loaner car since it's their fault my tire is not even there when they scheduled my appointment and they didn't call me to let me know! Wasted my time going there..I had to leave my car there and Uber home.

Later that evening, they called me to tell me my tire still hasn't arrived yet. They said the service department left so they don't know what's going on..Are you serious?! Finally they decided to give me a loaner car since my tire never came..so I had to go back AGAIN.

I was furious! How can you be so unorganized? This was the worst service I've ever received at a dealership. I expected more..especially from Mercedes.<//Text>< gmapID>

Best service always! When they’re not super busy, they’re so fast and efficient but that Sat was surprisingly busy even with shelter in place. They cleaned my car and because my car would be there for an extended time they gave me a brand new loaner which was so fun to drive anyway so I can’t complain. Giselle was super attentive and nice- Patrick, my mechanic was as always amazing.< /Text>

I purchased new GLB250 a month ago. I had really good experience for the whole purchasing such as big amount inventory, good deal, helpful and professional sales person and manager etc. I should have given them 5 start, but I did because following 2 reasons:
1. I have to wait more than a month to get my title. Without title I can't do registration and get license plate. I am not sure if that is a normal process or not, but it is too long for me.
2. Engine light was on when I first time drive the new car and it is off now, I need to closely monitor it. This makes me really disappointed at Mercedes-Benz. But I believe this is nothing to do with Stevens Creek dealer store.</Text>

<text>I took my E350  in for a Service B. I was met on time by Rodrigo my service manager. He was wearing a mask and observed the appropriate social distancing profile.  I told him it would be great if I could get the car back early afternoon as I had a conference call in the evening. He indicated that he would look into it and see what could be done. I was provided a loaner and was on my way. In about 3 hours I received a call from Rodrigo saying the car was ready. I appreciate the fact that he listened and took the extra effort to accommodate my schedule. The car was clean inside and out. Returned the loaner which again was zero hassle. I was glad that the dealership had hand sanitizers available for use. Again appreciated the attention to detail from Rodrigo's customer service to the cleanliness of the vehicle after service.<//text>< userid>

<text>Marvin the internet sales manager was easy to work with. I was originally going for an SUV but purchased my fourth S-Class sedan in July. Today, second week in September, I received the registration paperwork. That was only because I called inquiring about its status a couple weeks ago. On top of that, the address used is not the correct one. Now I have to deal with DMV to change it...ughh. I specifically told the finance director what I wanted on the title when I signed the paperwork. Sales experience was good, but back office execution is lacking compared to others I’ve dealt with, like the Mercedes dealer in Walnut Creek.< /text></record>

John Stansberry at Mercedes of Stevens Creek is the best service advisor I have worked with in my life (and I am 68 years old, so I have had lots to work with).  And I have been working with John for over 6 years. He is always clear about what is needed and willing to discuss alternatives. The cars are always ready when promised.  Very impressed with their adjustment to a "no touch" approach due to COVID-19.  Great experience.</review>

My sunglass holder fell out upon trying to use it for the first time. I called Asad, the salesman that sold me the car in November and he never returned my call. I set up an appt. to have it re-installed and when I arrived (early) I was told by Nate Jones that the tech wouldn't be able to even look at it for 2 1/2 hours. I live in Gilroy and didn't want to drive all the way back up again so I waited.  I was then told it would be $924.83 to replace it.< /text>

The service department at this location is awesome. They always give my car a wash, and as long as I’m on top of scheduling I can always get a vehicle until my car is done. Before the shelter-in-place this was always vital for me as I commute and it will be once it’s lifted to. My service advisors are always patient even though I always have a lot of questions and want details and it’s extra nice because I can simply text them about my car if there’s anything I forget to ask. This big team is great and the combination of all these things is the reason I choose to pay a little extra taking my car to the dealership.</Review>

So overall I liked the service, I had a flat tire and I called and dropped my car off for service and fixing my car. I just felt that the person who was taking care of me could have been a little bit more friendly. I felt like there are a couple of times where she was a little rude. Overall everything in the car was good. I also wish the person taking care of me could have been more proactive in letting me know about my car. I had to call and figure out what is happening to my car.<//Text>

Sales Misrepresentation at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek

Our vehicle, the 2018 Mercedes Benz C300, finished its first pre-paid maintenance at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek last week. However, yesterday was the first time that we know there is a three-year expiration date for our pre-paid maintenance package.

The vehicle was purchased in 2018 at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek. When we were discussing whether we should purchase the pre-paid maintenance plan, we raised the issue of what if we can not drive 10,000 miles per year and we can not finish three maintenance in three years. The salesperson explicitly told us: "It's a common misunderstanding that the customer believes they have to use the prepaid package in three years. It's actually not true. The package can be used as long as the mileage of the vehicle does not reach 30,000 miles." With the trust of the salesperson and the brand of Mercedes Benz, we believed this and purchased the package. Coincidentally, we did not drive much during the pandemic. It took our vehicle two years to reach 10,000 miles. Last week, Susan from the service department told us that there is an expiration date for our pre-paid maintenance package. Now we think this is a misrepresentation that happened during our vehicle purchase procedure.

We have contacted Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek and hope to solve this issue. None of them have worked. We are disappointed with the service of Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek and the misrepresentation during the purchase of our vehicle.

Maybe it's time to consider a Tesla for our next car. They are fully transparent and honest after all.</text>

I was thinking to give a 1 star. But I think they did the service on my car and it was great. But when I picked up my car I found all my stuff which were on my co-pilot were moved to the rear seats. This is OK I don't know you need that, definitely make room for the work. But they not only put all the dirty stuff right on my rear seats like shoes and basketball but also put my clothes on my rear floor! I had a tee and tissue and they were all flat. It means they sit on them and destroy my tissue!

I want to say sorry because I didn't clean up my co-pilot to give you more room. But please put clean stuff to clean space instead of floor!< /Review>

Excellent experience with this dealership so far. We test drove a vehicle.Sales person  very professional and nice. Did not ended buying from them, options were not on the car. Bought a vehicle from a different  non-Mercedes dealership and brought it here for maintenance and warranty work.

Mister Sir Master Certified Charlie Fish is our Service Advisor and Assistant Service Manager. Although a Big 🐟, Charlie is an actual person. A very good 👍 👏 👌 🙌 one. Patient, kind, professional , Charlie takes the time to take good care of your vehicle, therefore of you. Bravo 👏 ! Detail oriented, he pays attention to everything and goes above and beyond to make sure all is perfect. Gives straigh answers and honest  advice.

As mentioned above, has a Black Belt in Mercs,  so he really knows his kraft(i.e., your motorkraft). And that's good for you. Also keeps you posted on the progress.

And that's my story. And I don't inflate facts, because I'm not a fisherman.

PS. Almost forgot  this. In the buying process,  I bugged him few times about Mercedes vehicles i was looking at, yet he politely took the time to address my many questions,  though I was not a customer.  Then i realized i can bag a good 🐟.

Consistent quality service, as expected from Mercedes. But it's not about metal,  it's about people.<//Review>

<review>I've been coming to MB of Stevens Creek to get my cars serviced for nearly 10 years, and every time I'm impressed with the service.
Drop-off is easy; my advisor keeps me updated on the status of my car; and I'm always happy with the work.
Keep up the great work!< /review>< user>

Went to the Service Department on a Monday morning without an appointment.   Both of the batteries in my CLA 250 had failed. They were able to get me back up and running in short order while keeping me advised throughout the process. Friendly yet very professional Service Department including the Loaner Department.</text>

Sales Misrepresentation at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek

Our vehicle, the 2018 Mercedes Benz C300, finished its first pre-paid maintenance at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek last week. However, yesterday was the first time that we know there is a three-year expiration date for our pre-paid maintenance package.

The vehicle was purchased in 2018 at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek. When we were discussing whether we should purchase the pre-paid maintenance plan, we raised the issue of what if we can not drive 10,000 miles per year and we can not finish three maintenance in three years. The salesperson explicitly told us: "It's a common misunderstanding that the customer believes they have to use the prepaid package in three years. It's actually not true. The package can be used as long as the mileage of the vehicle does not reach 30,000 miles." With the trust of the salesperson and the brand of Mercedes Benz, we believed this and purchased the package. Coincidentally, we did not drive much during the pandemic. It took our vehicle two years to reach 10,000 miles. Last week, Susan from the service department told us that there is an expiration date for our pre-paid maintenance package. Now we think this is a misrepresentation that happened during our vehicle purchase procedure.

We have contacted Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek and hope to solve this issue. None of them have worked. We are disappointed with the service of Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek and the misrepresentation during the purchase of our vehicle.

Maybe it's time to consider a Tesla for our next car. They are fully transparent and honest after all.</Text>

EXCELLENT SALES TEAM! Jim Chassebi did a fantastic job from beginning to end. Jim went above and beyond to help me with my lease. He made a great first impression and his helpfulness made feel comfortable coming back to the dealership to complete the sales process. I went to the audi dealership and felt like they didn't want my money..... never looked back.

After a second test drive I felt that I was ready to buy and never felt any pressure from the dealership. Once the deal was done, I felt like I made the right choice.

If you are in the market to buy, check out MB of Stevens Creek, ask for Jim, he'll take care of you.</Text>

The admission of my car for service at Stevens Creek location was TERRIBLE!

I had an appointment at 9:20am (Oct 24, 2020), arrived there about 9:10am, there were 2-3 service advisors available, and I was completely ignored. 5 cars after mine were taken cared of, and nobody approached to my car.  Finally a guy (supervisor?) came to me and said that he had noticed me standing there for a while (~20 mins), and asked me if I had been serviced. Then he sent somebody and take care of car for service.

It has been a mystery to me why those advisors DID NOT DO the first come first service. I lined the queue, and had an appointment!

A very BAD Experience!</Text>

<Review>I just bought GLE53 at Mercedes-Benz Stevens Creek. Got helped by Jugbhir Singh. He has been really helpful and one of the best sales consultant I have come across at Mercedes-Benz. Jugbhir made sure I had the very best buying experience and that was actually the first time I enjoyed buying a car. He also took time to setup and gave me tutorial of the car’s MBUX system before I left the lot. He deserves to get more customer facing role as he definitely knows the skills to win customers.<//Review><time>1606012535861<//time>< Resp>

< review>
Worst experience I have ever had at a Mercedes Benz dealership. Raul, my service advisor, tried to sell me new rear tires for my car. He pushed several times. Alerting me that they needed to be replaced immediately. The rear tires are not new but they certainly do not need immediate replacement.

While Raul went to lunch, another advisor called me and stated the same thing about my tires. Pushing to sell replacement tires when it wasn’t necessary.

I paid $332 for the service. The worst part was that Raul nor his lunch replacement nor the actual service guy bothered to inflate my tires to their specified pressure. THIS IS NOT OKAY.

Three humans tried to sell me NEW tires but not one bothered to ensure my tires were properly inflated.

I will never bother to step foot inside this dealership again.

When I made a quote on truecar, they called me many times and they pushed me to buy the car. The price of my used car was $21000 but it went up to 37000, this includes the tax and the interest on the loan. The accountant pushed me to buy many unuseful things like dent insurance, tire insurance and extended warranty for almost $7000. I had to change the 2 front wheels, the cost is $420 and it is not covered by the tire insurance(which costs $2000). The cost for those wheels in Costco is $260. I want to cancell my warranty, I called them more than 10 times I left 4 voice messages. Nobody returned to my call.
Horrible customer service after you buy the car.
Do not waste your time with this dealer, search for another one who respect their customer< /text>

They treat customers like pushovers. They lied to our face saying that my new CLS 450 sensor problem is just something I have to get used to, while it's affecting the regular operating of driving and is very dangerous at the traffic intersection when it would not stop beeping and overwrote my screen and my map. If this is something customers need to put up with while paying so much money every month for this car, then please recall all your CLS 450 because this car is not functional.<//Text>

Had great service from checking the car in to paying for the service.

The check in person, service advisor, shuttle driver, cashier and parts employee were all service oriented and pleasant.

Picking up my car was another story. We were pretty much ignored and felt like we were inconveniencing the employee. No one was at the counter. When an employee did show up, he walked in, looked at us and then walked into the back without saying a word. We stood there for a few minutes more before a second employee came in and asked if we needed help. We told him that we wanted to pick up our car. He took our paperwork and went in the back. We could hear him asking the first employee why he didn’t help us, and the first employee said it wasn’t his turn to help somebody because they were alternating customers. The second employee finally retrieved our car.

Gave a 2 rating as it felt like “we got your money, don’t have to give good service anymore.”

I drive a little ways to come to this Dealership when there is one 5 minutes from my house.  I may have to consider that option going forward.</text>

<review>I had a bad experience with a dealership nearby so was ready to willingly overpay for an SUV at one of the reputable internet only car sales companies.  I recently dealt with Valeria in the sales dept. at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek.  She had been polite and helpful even though I didn’t proceed further on a vehicle purchase at that time.  She was willing to address any questions and concerns that I had and responded quickly to my messages.  This was at the onset of the pandemic so it was already a difficult time.  I ended up purchasing a vehicle through Valeria’s assistance at a later date, partly due to her continued professionalism and willingness to make an effort even knowing that I could have changed my mind.  (Their five-day or 250 mile money-back guarantee was also a big plus.)  Professionalism and common courtesy can go a long way!</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1591199737853, 'text': "Kim, we set high expectations for ourselves so it’s gratifying to hear you had a great experience with us.

<Time>1604425484331< /Time><review>Hi,
We have dropped our car for the very first servicing. Expected it to be regular servicing and would get my car back on the same day or the next.
But it happened that, the service agent called and told us that the service engine light is ON!, and the technicial is reviewing it.
After that in the next day's call, the told the thermostat is not working and needs to be replaced.
After that he went was off for a day or so and the other service agent called us and told there is another line / hose needs to be changed and the part is being ordered and don't know when it will be done.
We keep waiting for the car to be ready (in he meanwhile picked up a loaner for the dealship).

The 1st agent came in after the weekend, and we asked him to give him more details on whats going on with the call, and seems like the 2nd part that had been changed on my car, he was not aware of anything on it.
Now we are at a delimma that we don't know what has been fixed in my car, given from the year the car has been sittin in my drive way for 6+ months and had to go through fixing so much int he car, which we till date not aware of what all has been changed.

I didn't have a clarity on the service nor till date I know what all have been fixed in my New car.

I may think twice visiting the place for my next service.</review>< Rate>

I have been going to Mercedes Benz Stevens Creek for 5 years now, for all my servicing needs and have been working with Susan Sulemani for almost 3 of the 5 as my service advisor. You can immediately tell the difference in her level of knowledge, and quality of customer service. She is very personable, energetic, does her best and goes above & beyond to provide the best experience. It’s a pleasure to work with her every time I go there, and I highly recommend her.< /Review>

Excellent service and attention from  Jenna Morejon and Kamal.
their attitude was outstanding and exemplary;  they stayed till late night to provide me a quality service.  my family and myself are plenty grateful with them.
do not hesitate that you gained 4 customers for future car purchase.  you have to be proud to have people like them.<//text>

Did my yearly service. Labor cost was more than  the parts which were put in. No complain on that. But was expecting that the car would be atleast be vacuumed. After I opened the bonnet of the car it was still dirty and all the dried leaves were in there. I was like when you put your car for servicing you think that these people would be opening bonnet of the car and would clean it. Really poor service. Plus my key battery was low which was not replaced after putting a note on that. I could have given it to the mechanic outside and he would have done better job.</text>

Great experience working with Ken on purchasing a used vehicle from this dealership.  Because I was from out-of-town, Ken sent me a walk-around video of the car, then answered all my questions prior to me going to look at it.  It was an easy and professional transaction, with friendly staff.  I would highly recommendation Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek!< /Text>

Awesome Experience !!
What an outstanding car buying experience.  Words simply are not enough to describe my excellent experience purchasing my Mercedes GLA 250 4matic.  The tandem of Aramais and Jugbhir not to mention Mr. Farhan, really makes my buying experience so easy.  The entire process was thorough, honest and professional.  I will definitely recommend Mercedes-Benz – Stevens Creek to all my friends and family.  Absolutely without a doubt, the best around.
Thanks again Aramais and Jugbhir!</review>

The service rep name Susan was superb with her service, attentive to my needs, and go out of her way to help me get my car fix in a reasonable price and return my AMG to me with a nice car wash, which the other dealerships skept this final touch siting Covid-19 as an excuse not to wash my car. I definitely will go back to fix my front brake pads when it come to the schedule time.< /text>

<date>1588795791730<//date><rate>1<//rate><Review>I am the recent owner of a 2009 C63. I received my vehicle on Monday, 4/27, and it was love at first sight.

I called the local dealership, Mercedes-Benz Steven's Creek, and scheduled an inspection and the factory recall for the airbag. I dropped the vehicle off Thursday, 4/30 at 2pm, and picked up the vehicle Friday, 5/1 at 4pm.

Upon sitting in my vehicle and feeling the steering wheel, I immediately noticed that it made a "knocking sound" if you slightly rotated the wheel back and forth. This did not exist before I dropped off my vehicle.

I immediately parked the vehicle and went back inside to find my Service Adviser, Susan Sulimani. I informed her of the problem, my concern, and we scheduled a follow-up for Monday 5/4 at 9am.

On the way home, the driving was worse. The entire steering was off. The knocking was in the wheel, the steering wheel felt loose or like it had slop in it, there was a disconnectedness from the steering wheel to the road, and when adjusting the steering wheel tilt column there was a loud "crunch" sound. Even worse, the steering wheel locked up and got tight as I was entering the on-ramp of a freeway. I thought I was going to go into a guardrail.

I emailed Susan Friday, 5/1 evening and told her my follow-up concerns. She only offered a loaner car, no expedited service.

I dropped off my C63 to the dealership, they confirmed the knocking, and said they didn't do it. I spoke with the Service Director, Randy, and in his anger and frustration, he walked out of our conversation. I want my car fixed like how I dropped it off.

One of the other issues I brought up is that the service adviser said my tires were close to replacement. What makes that surprising is that the tires currently on the car are only 1 week old. When I brought this up, she defended her recommendation, said, "well, I don't know what kind of tires they sold you". We went outside, measured the tires, sure enough they were like-new and had green tread ware. She didn't apologize, only said she would remove the recommendation.</Review>< Pics>

Super expensive!!! I would not trust them with my car again. They quoted me over $1100 just to look at my car (no repair but just to connect it to the diagnostic machines because four warning signs would lite up every time I started the engine, so they wanted $350 for each warning issue diagnostic. I knew my car was in good shape so I found a local Mercedes mechanic that found out what was wrong with my car and only charged me $400 to correct the issue.<//Text>

Super expensive!!! I would not trust them with my car again. They quoted me over $1100 just to look at my car (no repair but just to connect it to the diagnostic machines because four warning signs would lite up every time I started the engine, so they wanted $350 for each warning issue diagnostic. I knew my car was in good shape so I found a local Mercedes mechanic that found out what was wrong with my car and only charged me $400 to correct the issue.</review>

My service guy Jay has worked with me since I bought the car in 2014 and always goes the distance to make sure everything is attended to and then some.   He never tries to sell me anything that doesn’t need to be done, reminds me of things to keep In mind and is genuinely a solid guy who is interested in helping me keep my car in good service.  Thank you Jay!!  You are the smiling face of mercedes for me and you always take good care of me!!!!!<//Review>

The agent I contacted in this dealer is Ellen Lans, who is the best seller among all agents I have seen at various dealers including Benz, Audi, and BMW. I have to say that she makes me happy along the whole journey of buying my current car. My friend who accompany me in my test drive also would like to buy a new car with her soon.</review>

Bought my Mercedes and Prepaid Maintenance from Mercedes Benz Stevens Creek, a year ago. After a whole year, I booked my first appointment for Oil change on a Saturday. This was going to be my 1st experience with Service Department of Mercedes Benz Stevens Creek. I requested a loaner vehicle with my appointment.

Rodrigo was my service advisor. He said that my car would be ready within 4 hours and told me to bring back the loaner the same day before 3pm, otherwise I would be charged per day. When I got the loaner vehicle, the documentation clearly stated that car needs to be returned by Monday morning.

At around 2pm on Saturday, Rodrigo called me and asked me to collect my car and drop off the loaner. When I told him that normally a customer has 24 hours notice period, he started yelling at me " I told you to return it today before 3pm". Furthermore, he started harassing me by saying that now I would be charged for a day. I told him "Lets discuss when we meet" to which he said that there is nothing to discuss and hung up.

Then, he called me back after 15 mins and said" I've checked with loaner department, you do have 24 hours. Now you have to return the loaner vehicle tomorrow (Sunday) by 3pm." I asked him if the dealership was open on Sunday. He said: "No but I am appointing someone for you"
By time time, I started feeling very uncomfortable and couldn't believe a Mercedes Benz Dealership would treat its customer like a fugitive. Loaner Department gave me a receipt which clearly mentioned Return day as Monday morning 10am.

Monday morning when I went to pick up my car, I had to involve the management to let them know about my absolutely devastating experience. While I was waiting in the car lot right next to my car, Rodrigo set off the car alarm with key remote and slowly walked towards me. The alarm kept sounding to which I was shocked how disrespectful an employee could be. As he approached me, there were no greetings. He straight away asked me" Did you get your paperwork?" I told him that I didn't. He said: "you will get it from the office".

My service advisor was deceitful and lacked basic customer service skills. Overall, I had a terrible experience. A roadside mechanic shop would have treated its customer better.. I have already requested to cancel different service packages that I bought with my car as I dont think I would be going back to Mercedes Benz Stevens Creek again.</review>

This is the first time I make a service appointment with MB of Stevens Creek. Scheduling is easy. Mr. Lopez is helpful. Waiting area is comfortable. Maybe I am not quite familiar with the process - a simple check / replace a broken spring takes 2 hours, and another 20-30 minutes line-up waiting for picking up the car...I would update the review when I have a chance to visit next time.</text>

<review>The low score is for the terrible service at pick-up.  After finishing the paper work, I was told that my car would be out soon. I waited and waited, but it took more than 20 minutes before my car finally came out..... unwashed. Since a complementary car wash was promised by my advisor, I asked them to wash it. It would be another 30 minutes before they came out with my washed car.

I want to emphasize that while I was waiting there weren't many other customers. In fact, I was the only one there by the time I sent them back for the car wash. Understandably a car wash takes time, but 30 minutes was unreasonable.

All in all, Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek made me wait ~50 minutes just to pick up my car.  A horrible experience.

Update on 6/10/2020: Just when you think their service can’t get worse, it does. On 6/8/2020, I took up the offer in their reply below to call their GM, and I left a message for him/her to call me back. Surprise surprise, I never got a call back. To Mercedes of Stevens Creek: if you don’t want to make things right, don’t bother posting here just for show.< /review>< Pictures>

I was a bit disappointed with how difficult it was to get ahold of a different service advisor on Saturday and called in five times trying to speak with someone to get my tire fixed. Called Susan once on Saturday and she returned my call first thing Monday morning and had my car fixed Monday afternoon. She is a model of customer service.< /Text>

It was great experience.   This was a fast and easy purchase.   The sales representative, Basir, did excellent job.   He explained very well the differences in the vehicles and helped pick the best one.   He also was there to resolve any issues or concerns.   The rest of the staff was also friendly, open and sincere in communication.< /review>

The gold 2002 is my first Mercedes. The car performed so well and the service at Mercedes Benz dealerships was always head and shoulders above all others that I decided to continue my experiences with MBUSA! I have bought two since then. One from MB OF PLEASANTON where Joe Manifesto was my salesman and my most recent from MB OF STEVENS CREEK. Mark Arnold is my salesman and continues to be my point of contact. I got such great car care from MB OF STOCKTON and i will continue taking my car there because Mercedes Benz doesn't care where you bought your car, everywhere gives you great care. Thank you guy and gals!< /text>

<text>I have bought nearly 20 cars in my life – all purchases were good to excellent experiences.  This purchase was not; quite the opposite.  I have never had such a poor experience.  I asked to speak with the General Manager or Finance Manager regarding the transaction – neither called me.  Was extremely dissatisfied!

Bought my new car for Kevin Hua. He made the process super easy. We were able to complete a lot of the process online before I came in. Kevin was able to workout a deal for me that got me exactly where I wanted to be with my trade and payment on the new car. I was only at the dealership for 3hours and left with my new car! Amazing considering my last experiences took a full day. I definitely recommend doing business here.<//review>

< Review>
We're Audi owners, used to own Mercedes in the late 80s and early 90s. Since there's no high line EV's except the B class and i3, we found our 2015 B class here on Auto trader for our mother. Slava was a great sales consultant, professional, patient and extremely knowledgeable about MBZ. We went back 3 times before we made our decision to purchase the car. Yes, I wore shorts and t-shirt and Slava still let me to test drive the car LOL. Since it's a used 1 price car, no negotiation or anything like that, everything went peacefully and stress-less. One thing wasn't done correctly was the day running lights were turned off, and when we came home to turn it on, one wasn't on, we had to bring it back for fixing. Troy was nice to take care of it, but this should happen if the technician who smog and safety this car did his job correctly, to me, I felt cheated regardless if it's an honest mistake, but all day running lights should be turned on. Anyhow, due to Slava and Troy performance, I still give 5 stars. For other customers, make sure to turn on everything before taking delivery, yes, it's under warranty, but taking it back, waiting for service is totally uncalled for.< /Review>

I was a bit disappointed with how difficult it was to get ahold of a different service advisor on Saturday and called in five times trying to speak with someone to get my tire fixed. Called Susan once on Saturday and she returned my call first thing Monday morning and had my car fixed Monday afternoon. She is a model of customer service.</Review>

It was great experience.   This was a fast and easy purchase.   The sales representative, Basir, did excellent job.   He explained very well the differences in the vehicles and helped pick the best one.   He also was there to resolve any issues or concerns.   The rest of the staff was also friendly, open and sincere in communication.<//review>

Aramais, our Sales Associate was marvelous, knowledgeable and accommodating, we got just the car we wanted (after he scoured the region). Car is impeccable . Aaron our finance associate was likewise knowledgeable and fast. Explained everything to our satisfaction. Only drawback, come on Mercedes, offer some cookies at least! Poor showing after spending so much money on a car!</text>

I was taken care of right away.  My car was scheduled for its annual maintenance.  The work was completed on time, including a car wash. John Stansberry does a great job coordinating all aspects of service.

I elected to wait for my car.  The waiting area is very comfortable, and liquid refreshments are provided.
This Mercedes dealership is a very friendly establishment.</review>

<name>Alan Ghahramani<//name><text>My Service Advisor, Susan S. said, "Can you wait in the showroom, I'll come and get you as soon as your car's service is done!".  I figured that's a reasonable request, except that 2.5 hours later still nobody came to get me. So I went back to the service advisor and asked, is my car ready?  Susan replied, "well I sent you an email letting you know your car is done!"  To my surprise, I was expecting someone to come over to get me and then I double checked my email and still didn't find anything!  I said, not only did you not come over to get me but you also didn't send an email either, so I could have been waiting forever without being notified.   Without any apology she said, well go to the cashier room and they have your car.  I said, do you mind if I check to see what email address you have for me first?  She said, oh this doesn't match the email on your business card!  I said could you please correct the typo, after some hesitation and reluctance she said, oh I see the typo, I can fix it for you!

When I went to the cashier and waited some more then the person had no clue where the spare key was that I purchased, we went back to the service rep and she said it should be somewhere in the car.  Why did they not put it on the keychain?  Both me and the cashier person looked at each other since neither of us knew of the process, we eventually found the key in the cup holder by iteself, not easy to spot.
Finally I took my car home and found that the hood had the front windshield connectors outside the hood and messed up!

I'm going back to the dealership now again to get the hood issue resolved.  Very poor service experience.</text>< Rate>

The day I spent $500 on service and got my car back I found the tire pressures are uneven and the car kept asking me to fix the problem. This is completely unacceptable. They service center is jazzy with decor, technology, nice coffee, glass desks and easy rental car pick up but something as basic as this should have been taken care of before delivering back to the customer. I am not sure why this is happening as well since there wasn't any issue before I dropped it off. Unfortunate,<//Text>

I took my car in because my sunroof  was not operating. Raul my service tech took my car in on a Saturday morning . I explained to him and Marvin that I was pressed for time and needed to be out by 11:30 am.
Marvin followed up with me on the progress of them updating the computer to figure out the code to repair. Just before 10:30 Raul  met with me and informed  the repair was taking longer than expected and set me up to get a loaner. even though it was a long line to pick up loaner , I waited and was out the door by 11:00 am.
Raul is a excellent service technician took care of my repair and was able to get them to honor my warranty.
I am pleased to say I received excellent service at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek.</text>

<Text>One of the worst dealerships I have been to. They don’t care and have absolutely no interest in customers and their inquiries. I met with sales rep, Basir, and he literally asked me to check the details online despite asking for quotes a few times. I would strongly suggest AutoBahn in Belmont/Redwood city or just cross the road to BMW dealership for some amazing sales staff.
Never owned an MB but if the sales staff doesn’t care then I can’t imagine how the service would be.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Alex Truong has been very helpful and handled my car professionally.  First I thought my trunk sensor wasn’t working properly and that was one of the reason to bring the car in . Alex  explained the way the sensor works and showed me how to do it the right way. He communicated with me the status of my car during the day and prepared the car ready to pick up while I was there. I m very happy with Alex’s service and I expect to have him to be my service advisor next time.<//Review>

Jay is an outstanding service advisor, always a pleasure to work with Jay.

My complaint with MBZ is the charges for any part or service are excessive. $600 for a battery!!  I bet you have a great story as to why  that GOLD plated battery is worth it. That's just one example.< /text>

Got my car serviced here. Overall the service was good. The staff were friendly and helpful. However, I'm giving a 2 stars for two reasons:

1)  When I asked the service manager overseeing my car when was the latest time I could pickup my car that evening he told me 5:45pm. I had to leave work midway through a meeting and rush to pickup my car only to have the lady at the customer service desk tell me the service center actually closes at 6:30pm not 5:45pm. Why would the service manager feel the need to lie about pick up times?

2) The next day I noticed one of the tire valve caps was missing from my car and called the service center. Instead of being apologetic or offering a replacement cap the lady on the phone informed me that the cost for a plastic valve cap was $3 and if I wanted a specialty valve cap that would be $20 for a set... I brought my car in with 4 tire valve caps and came out from my car service with only 3 and she has the gall to try to charge me for something they messed up. With the price markup that they charge here compared to other local garages you'd think they would offer better costumer service...</review>

I took the car in for software update/recall, Danny my service advisor was very professional and respectful and kept in touch while the car was being worked on, excellent support.
I also enjoyed my ride back from Marvin whom I found to be very interesting and kind and full of stories to tell. Thank you!!

Finally, the reason I didn’t rate my experience to be 5 stars, was because someone forgot to close my hood completely, so I had to pull over on freeway to close it firmly and make sure it was latched / locked 100%. This was dangerous to do but since the next exit was 10miles away, I had no choice. I hope such mishap didn’t happen to others in the past, and MBZ takes this to consideration in the future as safety step.<//review>

I would like to mention the great service that Jugbhir provided during my overall purchasing experience. I was extremely impressed. He showed his dedication and sincerity to help me get what I need. He is highly knowledgeable and knows his stuff. I had a great experience buying a car from him without any hassle! I would definitely recommend him to all of my family and friends for future car buying!!! A+ WORK! However, the finance dept on the other hand could use some improvements by providing better detailed finance information, and accessibility as they were extremely hard to get a hold of by phone. Besides that, outstanding customer service by Jughbir.</text>

<Review>I was looking fro lease/purchase my first car. I went to BMW, Lexus, Volvo and contacted with many dealers in the Bay Area. This is the great one. Joaquin is a nice sales consultant no matter I am interested in brand new C300 convertible or C300 coupe or a pre-owned CLA250. He understands that car purchasing is not shopping at groceries and people need time to consider. He was patient and spent efforts helping to close the deal. Other people I met in this dealership also behaved in very professional manner and I am very happy to buy a car there.<//Review><GmapID>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I bought an electronic car here on 9/21/19, but found out it takes over 20 hours for full charged. It is a big different with what the salesman said only 6-8 hours charging time. I returned the car on the 9/25/19 (the 4th day of purchase). During these 4 days, I won't be able to enjoy the car. It was sitting for charging most of the time. According to the sale agreement, customer will get full refund if the car is returned within 5 days. So, I expected for the full refund. So far, I only rec'd the credit card refund. The payment that paid by check has not yet been refunded. Per my bank record,  my check was cashed out on 9/24/19. I have been kept waiting and following up with the salesman and the finance people. They don't help. Each time I called, they just asked me to continue wait. Since last weekend they did not pick up the phone call and did not return my text either.  I don't think this is the right way to pursue a business.<//Review><date>1572907427225</date><rating>1</rating><username>RB Jade<//username>< UserId.>

<review>Sales process was really smooth. I am actually impressed by the professionalism of the staff. During the complete process i never felt like that i am being rushed into making any decisions and neither we were pushed for deciding lease vs buy vs finance. Sales people interacting with us were very knowledgeable and has full awareness about all the different models and differences in them .
Overall it was a pleasant experience.<//review>< pics>

After understanding my concerns, the representative said she would transfer to my sales person, who I knew was not working at the dealership during the shelter in place. Then I called again, after multiple transfers, service part answered that they even don't have the plug for the holes. Ok I will DIY. And as a car buyer, you'd better check every resources and get everything in mid before heading into the dealership. My bad I missed this one.

Edit 2: A small round smudge on the driver side window (inside) is found the next day of the new car pick up (which was at 8 pm, my bad that I said yes). The smudge is confirmed that cannot be removed today in a window tint shop. Don't bother to contact them again but this is disappointing.

Got a high trim A class here three months ago. Would be 5 stars if they didn’t drill 3 holes on the new buddy’s front bumper to put on the silly front license plate; Let alone that the the license plate is not placed in the middle of the frame... Ok I understand that it is theoretically illegal to miss the front plate, but this car is for commuting which means it stays in either the garage or company parking lot almost 99% of the time and few cops give you a ticket just for this!

I dropped off my E350 for routine maintenance.  I had an extended warranty and a pre-paid service plan.  I was given a complimentary loaner car.  The service center took care of the maintenance issue, and also addressed a two minor repairs that had come up.

<Gmap_id>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798</Gmap_id><Text>I highly recommend not going there. I was disappointed in two points.
1. My car had an issue making squeaky noise when closing front door window. I asked the manager to fix it, but what he said is, "there is a sticker on the window which I was supposed to remove when I first bought the car. This sticker might have damaged inside the door, and since this is your fault, this fix cannot be covered by warranty." This is evidently their fault, because I was not informed that I had to remove the sticker and not removing it can cause this kind of problem. Eventually this fix was able to be covered by the warranty, but their attitude was very unfriendly.
2. I went to the dealership to pickup my car. After finishing making payment, I was waiting to get my car key back. After 30 minutes, they told me that they gave my car to another customer as loaners (WHAT!!). I think it was not intentional, but purely due to miscommunications among themselves. I was able to get my car back in 2 hours, but I'm very very disappointed by their unprofessional service.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1579028081397, 'text': 'Jaewook, we regret your experience with us here, but are glad you brought this to our attention.

I have been a customer, for several new cars and service, at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek (and Smyth European, the former name of this dealership) since 1997.  That's because the service, quality of all the staff, and vehicles themselves have been consistently excellent.
This visit was for 40K service and while all the work was done in a timely and thorough fashion, technicians discovered two additional problems, both of which were covered under warranty and would take additional time so I was provided a free loaner vehicle for two days.
I recommend Tony Spencer, as the most knowledgable, helpful and thoroughly prepared to assist sales person.
Over the years the service technician, Felix, engaged me in a friendly, informative fashion, took extra time to provide not just info about the service work, but also additional suggestions about vehicle maintenance going forward.  He is professional, thorough, and works to make YOU feel a part of his team to take care of your car.

<review>It's alright. They have a better service than Capitol Expressway dealer. No donuts and coffee for customers. So Cheap!
They have so many cars come in and they don't have time to take care of customers a little more at personal satisfaction. We've paid $5k for warranty services and what they do is just to oil change, wipers changes and check tire pressure. Anything else we ask them to look at, $250 more just to check, said my concierge.
$5000 we paid is down the drain. We could have done these three services at cheaper price elsewhere.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1571864435810, 'text': "Richard, thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback.

I highly recommend not going there. I was disappointed in two points.
1. My car had an issue making squeaky noise when closing front door window. I asked the manager to fix it, but what he said is, "there is a sticker on the window which I was supposed to remove when I first bought the car. This sticker might have damaged inside the door, and since this is your fault, this fix cannot be covered by warranty." This is evidently their fault, because I was not informed that I had to remove the sticker and not removing it can cause this kind of problem. Eventually this fix was able to be covered by the warranty, but their attitude was very unfriendly.
2. I went to the dealership to pickup my car. After finishing making payment, I was waiting to get my car key back. After 30 minutes, they told me that they gave my car to another customer as loaners (WHAT!!). I think it was not intentional, but purely due to miscommunications among themselves. I was able to get my car back in 2 hours, but I'm very very disappointed by their unprofessional service.</text>

<review>BEWARE - they do not take responsibility if anything happens to your vehicle during servicing. Take thorough photos before and after to make sure nothing is out of the ordinary.

Took my car in for servicing due to an airbag recall. Didn't want anything else done to the vehicle and made it very clear. Should have been a simple fix. Dropped it off in the morning and came back 6 hours later to pick it up.
The car was returned to me in with filth all over the tires, as if they drove it through a dirt road and did not clean it at all. I put brand new Michelin tires on the vehicle and admitted the car in the morning with the tires in perfect condition, but they were returned covered in dirt and dust as if they were 5 year old tires.
My right side rear view mirror light was also broken, which was working perfectly fine when I admitted the car in the morning. There was also a small bump on the mirror casing, which makes it seem that they bumped it with a service cart or something of sorts. There is a new warning on my dashboard that was not there when I admitted the car in the morning, which was confirmed by my service records that states there was no "service light" warning.
Spoke to the assistant manager which also brought out his manager and none of them would take any responsibility for the condition and damage they have caused. Albeit a small inconvenience, they just kept saying "I don't know how it became like this and I don't know what happened."
I simply don't trust them enough to bring my car back here and I don't want them touching my car again.</review>< pictures>

<review>My refund check was promised to be processed in 15 days, however, I have been waiting for over 35 days and still not yet received my check. I bought an electronic car here on 9/21/19, but found out it takes over 20 hours for full charged. It is a big different with what the salesman said only 6-8 hours charging time. I returned the car on the 9/25/19 (the 4th day of purchase). During these 4 days, I won't be able to enjoy the car. It was sitting for charging most of the time. According to the sale agreement, customer will get full refund if the car is returned within 5 days. So, I expected for the full refund. So far, I only rec'd the credit card refund. The payment that paid by check has not yet been refunded. Per my bank record,  my check was cashed out on 9/24/19. I have been kept waiting and following up with the salesman and the finance people. They don't help. Each time I called, they just asked me to continue wait. Since last weekend they did not pick up the phone call and did not return my text either.  I don't think this is the right way to pursue a business.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Can't say anything positive about our visit to the dealer. We were looking for a new (quite expensive ) car and I was surprised to receive zero attention from the personnel as we were walking around the showroom and in the parking lot for quite a while. I could not find anyone to help me. This was my first and last experience with Mercedes.</Review>< user>

Giving Kevin H. and Linh M. 5 stars for their great customer service. This was my first time leasing a vehicle, and it was one the more pleasant experiences I had. They could relate on a personal level, and I never felt pressured to purchase anything. I had a mishap with the vehicle I had purchased, which I'm sure caused some inconveniences, but they were able to square everything away (even though it was my fault).</Review>

I dropped off my E350 for routine maintenance.  I had an extended warranty and a pre-paid service plan.  I was given a complimentary loaner car.  The service center took care of the maintenance issue, and also addressed a two minor repairs that had come up.

<UserId.>108491927486595228354<//UserId.><Text>The service team deserves five stars.  My only criticism, which I have with almost every visit, is the poor experience getting my car after service has been completed.  The problem appears to be a lack of parking space and management.

As usual, I took my papers to the car retrieval desk after paying.  No one was there for a few minutes. (Suggestion 1: have the cashier ask the customer if he or she is ready to pick up the car and have the car ordered up immediately electronically.) Next the guy shows up, looks at my paper work, tells me he will pull up the car right away “here.” The implication is that I should wait there.  I did.  It took about ten minutes for the car to arrive.  (I am sure this was not the fault of the attendant and more the result of too many cars in not enough space.  He apologized for how long it took.  It is the fault of a poor architectural design process that created a bottleneck at pickup.). This was at 3:00 pm when there was not a crush of people. (Suggestion 2: ask the customers to take a seat in the lounge and then call them when their car arrives.  I don’t mind waiting in a pleasant location in a comfortable seat. I do mind being told to wait standing up so that the attendant does not have to get me.  And by the way, i have waited sitting down in the past and the attendant did not bother to walk in to get me.  Other places announce over a speaker when your car arrives.)<//Text><Time>1573670305454</Time><Rate>4<//Rate><Gmap_id>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798<//Gmap_id><Resp>{'time': 1573691196654, 'text': 'Hello Russell, thank you; we appreciate all of your feedback as it helps us learn how we can improve.

Had a pleasant experience getting my first Mercedes. The only negative was that my sales person barely addressed me when talking about the car. She kept talking to my friend even though my friend did not have anything to do with the vehicle.

I felt a bit disrespected at the fact that I was being left out even though I was the one getting the car. I figured the sales person thought my friend was my spouse or something so she might be trying to sell the spouse so that the husband gets convinced to buy maybe? But even after letting her know that wasn't the case, the sales person would still speak directly to my friend even when I would ask questions.

That was the only hiccup, other than that everything went smoothly and was happy with my new car.< /Text>

<review>We had a satisfying experience at this dealership. Everyone was curious and  with a no pressure approach.

Guys we met and helped us though the buying process Martin, David and Arron where great.

The car GLA 250 is fabulous. My wife could not be happier.</review>< Pictures>

<review>I had one of the best car buying experience. Slava showed me the various car models based on my needs, took me on a test drive explaining all unique Mercedes features. Followed up on my visit when I was traveling to fit my schedule. When I came in for my final purchase he helped me look through all color options, test drive the exact car I was getting and even reconsider the offer when requested.
Very happy to be part of Mercedes family. 😊</review>< Response>

I have purchased a 2017 Mercedes Benz C300 CPO last week and it was delivered to me on Monday by Aramais Bagdasaryan on his day off. How about that for a customer service? Stevens Creek Mercedes is a top notch dealership including Kevin Sitch GM whose number one priority is a "HAPPY" customer! The communication between dealer and customer is second to none. I got the car what l wanted and could not be happier. Aramais is a great salesman with a smile! No pressure, just great service!
Overall my hats off to Stevens Creek Mercedes and thank you for a great experience purchasing a new vehicle. Also wanted to mention their great financial people Samir Karimi and Nicolas Kith for their polite, prompt communications.
BTW their COVID 19 response is great and felt safe all the time while buying the vehicle.
Definitely coming back for my next ride in the future!
Thank you!< /review>

I’d like to update my review and completely change it. While test driving the car I bought I pointed out to the salesmen, Alex, that the “service now” light was on. He assured me it would be taken care of. Proceeded with the paper and while signing again, brought up the light and again told it would be taken care of and to bring the car back next week and they’d reset it.

I brought the car back the following Thursday to have them turn the light off to which the head of the used cars told me they were unable to do due to not being “certified Audi mechanics”, um ok cool, but if you are certified why did you do the work to begin with, especially if you can’t finish the job??

I the proceed to call the Audi dealer because there was also a recall in the car that wasn’t taken care if and they tell me that they'll do the light for me but it will cost $80 and considering I just bought the car and it has a warranty Mercedes should be paying.

Then I call my salesman, Alex, again and he calls me back and his solution to my problem is to just drive the car with the light and then have it reset. Seriously? He said he’d talk to his boss and call me back. Fast forward 5 days and 2 phone calls later I still haven’t heard from them.

I took my car to Audi and not only were they the nicest people at a car dealership  I have ever seen after hearing how badly I was treated by Mercedes they reset my light for free.

So unless you are ready to drop a couple hundred grand a car, you will get no respect or service from these people.</text>

It was my First Benz (a220)and I have to say the buying experience was very smooth. My interaction was with Bill and he helped me out on multiple models choices. Even after all documentation I decided to change the color , he happily helped me out even though it was getting very late. 5 stars to him for his professionalism. I surely look forward for repeat Business with them.</review>

Customer service always exceptional - from Jake my service advisor to the cashiers to the guys who get my car.

My only glitch this time is why MB has to charge $235 just to look at why my steering wheel adjustment doesn't work. I spent $1600 on tires and brake pads and you want to ding me for a diagnostic cost? Same for when the gas cap isn't secure the check engine light comes on. That's not my fault, that's a design issue.

Figure this one out b/c it leaves a bad taste in my mouth and questioning whether I'll get another Benz next car.</Text>

<Review>Consistency is why I have my vehicle serviced here. From the beginning of my vehicles service appointment to the end I have had for the past 2 years a pleasant and efficient experience at this dealership. My service advisor Rodrigo always greets me with a pleasant attitude and a very knowledgeable recommendation on what needs to be serviced on my Mercedes. I have been to other dealerships closer to home to have my vehicle serviced but this service department is on another (higher) level. I highly recommend this service department and especially Rodrigo.</Review>< pics>

<Review>I had no intention of buying a MB vehicle, I was browsing a new BMW across the street being a loyal BMW customer. Loved the Mercedes cars, but more importantly the level of service I got from Mercedes Stevens Creek ultimately convinced me to make the purchase. Kevin and Samir packaged a deal I couldn’t say no to.</Review>< Pictures>

It was my First Benz (a220)and I have to say the buying experience was very smooth. My interaction was with Bill and he helped me out on multiple models choices. Even after all documentation I decided to change the color , he happily helped me out even though it was getting very late. 5 stars to him for his professionalism. I surely look forward for repeat Business with them.</text>

This was my first visit to the dealership.  I scheduled an appointment for B3 service and a noise in the steering column.  The service rep thoroughly inspected the exterior of the car and clearly explained what the B3 service covered.  When I picked up the car that evening, it looked brand new and the noise in the steering column was gone.  Very satisfied!</Text>

<review>The staff is mostly VERY helpful. Two stars because of the racist gentleman  at the accessories station, and the racist white girl at the front desk. She saw me approaching and deliberately turned her back so as to avoid helping me. Her very nice Asian associate noticed the sleight and stepped in to help me. Avoid going there if you can. Explore your options. San Jose MB is not too far away.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Went to MB dealership on Stevens creek. My experience so far has been good.
The last time, happened last week, dealership estimated that problem fix requires 10h of work plus parts and total cost is 2500 USD.
I came home and fixed the problem in 3.5h without any parts and very limited tools available.</text>

He always does a great job for us when we bring any of our cars for service!

I'm only giving 4 stars because this time there was a loooong line for drop off and I had to wait about 30 minutes for my drop off & car rental.
Then, service didn't get to "check out" my problem until the next day, so repairs took 3 days.  Didn't bother me much as I didn't really need my car.  However, had I needed my car for travel, I would have liked a faster turn around for service.
Still think that Charlie handled the situation well!

< Review>
Nice facility with standard perks of an MB dealership. Came to have my brake lights replaced after bulbs ran out. Driveway service was reasonably fast on an afternoon (30 mins). Only downside is that there is a standard $20 labor charge for any service, so despite the bulbs costing only $6, still had to pay the $20 labor fee, which was a bit frustrating given that no other dealership has charged me in the past for replacing the bulbs. People are nice and a big open lounge space.<//Review>

Went to get my car serviced for the 1st time since buying it. Edwin recommended that I get new tires, which it did need. Picked up the car from the dealer when they were done around 2:20 PM, as I’m driving my 2 year old son to the park at 4:30 PM I get a notification that there is a fire malfunction on the front left tire. It went from 36 PSI to 1 PSI in 2 minutes, immediately pulled over since I didn’t want to risk my son’s or my safety on driving on a flat tire. When I got out, I heard the air gushing out of the tire. Called Edwin immediately, who didn’t pick up. Called the dealership right after who transferred me to Edwin who apparently was now available after I told the clerk what happened. He claimed that I obviously drove over a nail which clearly caused this, not the fact that they messed up when installing my tires. I told him that it was impossible for a nail to do that in a span of 2 minutes plus that I heard the air gushing out the tire. He didn’t care and told me to just have a tow truck take it to the dealer. Called Edwin again at 4:50 PM to try to let him know the tow truck was on its way to drop it off, didn’t pick up again. Inspected the tire for any nails, didn’t see any. When the tow truck guy arrived he also inspected the tire and didn’t find any nails. Next day they called me saying that it was a nail that immediately gave me a flat tire, not a bolt or a metal piece but a simple nail flattened my “good” Continental tires that cost almost $1,300. Requested to have the tires replaced since I no longer felt comfortable with them, said that he would have to refer me to his manager Jim. I asked Jim for a photo proving that it was a nail that did it, apparently couldn’t prove any proof that it was a nail. I told Jim that I did not feel safe with those tires, especially since my wife uses it to drive our son and requested a refund for them and buy a different brand. He stated that since driving over a nail was a common issue, he could not refund our tires or do anything for us and that what happened wasn’t a big deal even though it put my baby’s safety in jeopardy. Apparently his commission bonus is more important that a baby’s life. Jim said it was common for the “regular joe” to not see the nail since it might have been in the tread or it was “dark” when we reached. This happened at 4:30PM afternoon and 2 different people checked. I reached out to multiple mechanics and car experts who all said that it’s impossible for a nail to do that in 2 minutes, especially since I heard the air coming out and that it wasn’t installed properly. They refused to take responsibility and stuck to their lie all to keep their commission.

Reply to owner: I did, his name is Jim. He said he wasn’t able to do anything since it wasn’t a big deal and that his tire employees are highly experienced and there was no way that they messed up installing the tires. However if we were on the highway or somewhere where I couldn’t pull over, I would have been responsible for the expenses since I drove the car on a flat tire and damaged it or lost control and got into an accident.<//text>

< review>
I give it #2 ⭐️⭐️. They provide a loaner, the receptionist Hanna was proactive and has the initiative to meet my needs. The company have their process but it was not followed in this instance. The CONS is that.              ... 1. I waited outside for 15 minutes( the instructions is wait outside in my car for the service person to meet me)      . 2.  The service person never showed up , while I was there to set up my car for service or even when I picked up my car.                                                    He called me on the phone 1.5 hrs after I drop off my car and the day I picked up the car.                                     2. Inconsistent information. Should review and confirm info before communicating to customers. Gave me #2 different information of what my car needs. 1st that on top of the required B service  it needs brake fluid and to rotate your tires based on his “ review of the car history”  but then on the day I picked it up he said via phone  that only service A was done” based on the review of history “( Which I’m relieved coz the cost is almost a 3rd of the initial info). With that I’m grateful that the service cost was done in a  truthful manner.                                   Tips for MB customers : don’t wait and don’t just say yes to any service or repair until visually confirmed and in writing.< /review>

I would highly recommend this dealership. After going to other dealerships I was disheartened because I kept coming across salesman who would not offer me what I was looking for. However, when I came here as a last effort to find my dream car, they immediately took it upon themselves to find the car in the color and price point I wanted to pay. I really appreciate how courteous they were through the whole process. I’m extremely happy and satisfied with my new purchase.< /review>

Air pressure was dropping too fast in one of my tires.  Took the car in on a Saturday without an appointment as I had a long drive planned for Monday.  I had to wait a couple hours but they found a nail, patched it, and sent me on my way.<//text>

Overall, great experience with buying my GLE 350 with David at Steven creek. David is honest and tries to take care of the customers at the best of their interests. The whole process was smooth and efficient. I would love to go back and buy another MB car with David.

The experience with finance was a bummer. They over charged the price on maintenance plan and other add-ons. Just be cautious.<//text>

<Text>Advisor was great. Other stuff not so hot.

Cashier department not so good. The person attending was confused on how to operate the system because apparently it said I already paid. After multiple attempts he finally got help, also was helping the person behind me while I’m just standing there. Not sure if this is the most professional manner for a customer facing position. Gave me the paperwork back and didn’t even tell me where to pick up my car.

The best thing comes when my car arrived. The interior was dirtier than when I took my car in (my car is less than a year old) - someone left a Nutter Butter left over paper wrap in my car and there were scrapped all over the place around the center console. Totally unacceptable. (Got picture to share if you’re interested to see this)<//Text><gmapID>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798<//gmapID>< Pics>

<Review>I had a great experience at the Stevens Creek dealership. I took my car for a routine service. The most impressive was that the rep greets you from the moment you drive in the car until you pick it up. Everyone walks around with a tablet and there is no paper flying around whatsoever. Keep moving forward MB!</Review><user_name>Mary M</user_name><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

<Text>Pick Mercedes-Benz and its service is one of my favorite brags, no mention my daughter always shows her obsession with MOM's car. I feel very happy and appreciate in most recent service maintenance visiting. Besides, the check-in process is always fast, professional and friendly, shuttle service is faster and amazing. What make the service most  impressive is its quality, I felt my "little white one" get reborn,  seems younger, stronger and prettier. now drive so smooth and stable that subtile unbalance I once experienced totally disappeared. Just as people always say picking a house seriously, it is 20+ years "relationship", same to car and its maintenance, it is a 8+ years "relationship" :).< /Text>< UserId.>

I wanted to like this place. It's such a beautiful facility. They did an airbag recall on my car. That went fine. However,

When I asked about getting a quote for replacing the roof rack molding/rails on the top of the car because the clear coat is peeling, the advisor wanted to talk about how that doesn't happen, that someone must have painted them. (they weren't painted) I wasn't looking for a warranty claim or even a reason. It all came off as sort of defensive. It did make me Google the problem though. And... the peeling clear coat is a common complaint. :)

When I went to pick up the car on Saturday morning around 10, there were many people in line for their cars and to get loaners, but just one guy slowly processing things. After 15 mins, I did ask the service manager if he could get more help, which he did right away.</Text>

The process of buying someone's first car is always a special occasion. It should be exciting and invigorate a great feeling to the buyer. I had been looking forward to trying the Mercedes Benz for a long time based on all the things I already knew about it. So it really depends on the experience you have with salesperson to be able to get you even more excited when leaving the dealership than when you entered it. My experience with a salesperson <who shall remain nameless>  completely put me off from purchasing a new Mercedes.

I had made an appointment with them to test drive a car and even then, when I reached the dealership, it took me 45 minutes to even see the person. When we finally got to the test drive, this person was lethargic and uninterested, almost to the point where I was thinking that I wasn't being considered as a serious buyer. They didn't know half the features of the car and I had to ask them about many features which I had read up on, some of which they were not able to demonstrate. At this point I was just waiting to get out of the car. I had also asked them to follow up with an email regarding quotes and the features of the car which they had not mentioned and I received nothing. All of this just screams unprofessional to me. I entered the dealership with Mercedes as primary target and left with all impressions of the car completely tarnished.

Thankfully, I ended up purchasing a different car, and no it is not a Mercedes Benz.

TL;DR: Your car buying process heavily depends on your experience with the salesperson<//Text>

<Review>We are having a VERY UNSATISFACTORY used car experience. The dealer advertises a thorough "worry-free inspection" and a 5-day money-back return policy. Don't believe it. We bought a used car, with all of these assurances, and had our own mechanic inspect the car three days after purchase. The mechanic found unsafe rear brakes (10% remaining) and a cracked belt. I contacted the dealer, because it was either they pay to fix it or we would return it within our 5-day window. The dealer said "fix it, send us the bill, we will reimburse."  So we did that. THREE MONTHS have passed, involving numerous emails, numerous phone calls, and I have not been reimbursed. This is not the service I expected. Not in the least. I am left with no alternatives at this point, and them owing me more than $500.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek really doesn't live up to the brand reputation. I've had about five services with different vehicles at this location and each experience left something to be desired. From big things like not re-installing engine compartment protectors, leaving engine oil dirty after performing an oil change, to small things like not washing vehicle exterior as per advisor recommendation on a repair ~$1k and not being able to find records of my previous visits.  They are centrally located which is nice, but if another shop opens in a 15 mile range I would probably go there instead.</review>

<Text>Very bad experience. Emailed me said my advisor is X, on the day, it's Y aproching me which is fine. When Y called me the car is ready but when I go picking up my car, the gentleman in loaner said the car is under washing, he then went & check, never came back. Another gentleman came asked whether I've been taken care of, told him my situation. he went & checked and found my car is waiting outside, not washed, and I've been waiting there like a fool for about half an hour.</Text>< Pictures>

My advisor Troy is the best.  He is so accommodating, efficient and so knowledgeable.  You also have an excellent employee where I checked out a loaner car.  Since my car is a 2010 C300, the CLA that was given to me looked a lot different with all the new structure on the dashboard.  He was kind enough to explain the features to me before I took off.  He was very polite and professional.</Text>

Pleasantly surprised how easy it was for me to get my car. The guys were very nice and professional. The women that worked there were very friendly. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone.
The above is an earlier review. Unfortunately this system only allows you to review once. But you can hit edit.
So for this visit, during COVID-19. Mercedes has the safety down pack.
I truly appreciate the easy one on one service with my service representative Nate. He is such a good person even in these unusual times. He is still so cool & professional. He’s like a cool little brother. I truly appreciate the safety measure that have been taken here to make every one feel safe and special. That’s why Mercedes is Mercedes.< /Text>

I was very happy with Aramais and his help to purchase my new car.  Very authentic, helpful, and answered all my questions.  I would definitely buy another car from him.

However, I give the finance manager 1 star.  He was very inauthentic and kept trying to offer me packages even after i said "no more."  Kept telling me that I was special with APR and because I am so nice..... I had a 2.5% APR from BMW, so I'm no fool!

Anyways,  5 star for Aramais, 1 star for finance manager, 4 star overrall.

Update 07/30/2020:. It's been almost 7 months and I still have not received my license plates. Called twice and did not get a call back.< /review>

Everything about the experience of the service was seamless, especially coordinating with my advisor John Stansberry. Only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because the time it took to get my complimentary vehicle. Mildly chaotic and apparently limited car availability. That specific process took almost 30 minutes.

Marvin, our sales guy helped out  finding a new car after our BMW lease expired. He gave us enough time, never pushed in a particular direction and in the end, found a car within our budget. Overall,  the dealership experience was far better than other competing brands like BMW .<//text>

<Text>Had a great experience buying my car with PETER. He is professional, kind and patient during the whole process. He sent us a reasonable quote for the car I was interested. Peter took me to the test driving and took care of all the paperwork which creates a very smooth purchase experience. In the end, Peter also showed up many tips on configuring the car. It turned out to be very useful.
I would recommend Peter as adviser for buying a Mercedes car!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I just leased the 2020 Cardinal Red GLC300 4matic from Stevenscreek. I had a very good experience buying from them. Went in at around 2.30 pm and was out with the car within 2 hours. When you are inquiring ask for Kenneth, he is very friendly and can provide you a very good deal. I am yet to have the servicing, so will update the review once I get the chance.< /review>

Awesome place to buy a car. Really modern and great customer service. I went there to buy a car and the people are really there to give customers a good experience while providing a non pressured sales tactics. I went to several dealers this month and by far the best quality of people and professionalism shout out to Jim and the sales people. Keep up the good work ethic.Thank you and maybe one day I’ll be back again to buy my dream car.<//Review>

<Review>My car was having some issues and needed immediate attention.
Was referred by a friend to get in touch with John S. The dealership was a bit out of the way for me, but I'm glad I listened.
John was able to get me in and out the following week. Quickly diagnosed the issue and worked to solve it quickly. Kept me up to date on all things. Thanks John and team!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>This place doesn’t have any credibility on their words. I was told it takes around 30 days to get refund on my cancellation of warranty. However it’s almost 3 months, I still haven’t got my money back. Their staff is also not actively answering phone calls. I have to be there personally to check the status. Overall it’s an awful experience. I will definitely switch to another car brand in my next purchase.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1569290114109, 'text': "Hi, we appreciate you taking the time to respond.

The vehicle had just come from a full service performed by a private Mercedes shop (Mercedes Master-certified mechanic).  The claim was found to be incorrect - the engine is NOT leaking oil.  My experience is this service department creates false and unverifiable claims for extra business.  They also claimed the brakes needed immediate replacing (3mm).  Actual brake thickness was found to be sufficient (5mm) until next 10k service.  On the positive, check-in process was good, quick, efficient.

Service was awesome!  Jake and every person I dealt with at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek were worth 10 stars!  I would recommend them to anyone for service without hesitation!!

However, my next comment pertains specifically to MBUSA and has *nothing* to do with anyone or anything pertaining to Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek.

I currently drive a SL63, my last Mercedes was an E63.  I have extensive experience with other high end, luxury and exotic car manufacturers.  This was my first experience with any real warranty work from MBUSA.  Where other manufacturers that I have experience with tend to go out of their way to try to get everything they can covered under the bumper to bumper warranty as a way to build good will with the customer, it was my experience that MBUSA's policy is sadly just the opposite.  I will admit MBUSA's policy is perhaps more beneficial to the corporate balance sheet short term, I question the long term benefits.  The diagnostic feeS in particular are just insulting knowing how much I paid for my cars.  I'd hope one day corporate Mercedes would recognize acts of good will, while perhaps short term costly, would go a long way to building a long term customer base and profits.  I actually felt sorry for the great people at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek for having to enforce the corporate warranty policy.< /Text>

The service department at Stevens Creek Mercedes is simply fantastic. Charlie Fish, my service advisor, is such a professional and caring person. He takes great care of my car, keeps it running smoothly and provides the guidance and information I need to make sound decisions on the repairs of my vehicle. I have been at other dealerships for service in the past, but would never go anywhere else since I have found Stevens Creek Mercedes.</text>

The service department of Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek is amazingly well run, judging from a number of appointments all day... and the speed for me to get in and out of the facility.

In my experience, the service team is awesome.  Just last week, I stopped by with a milestone maintenance.  Jake Tran was attentive, clearly communicated the work to be done and off I went to work.  When I returned, Jake greeted me as I walk passed his desk and picked up my car from an adjacent lot.  It was very personable and clearly, the Mercedes-Benz way.  I will definitely return for my service needs!<//Text>

<text>I am very happy to get my 2019 GLA 250. It's all because of help by Mr. Islam who was our salesperson and Manager Mr. Martin. They both were very nice and very helpful, indeed very friendly as well. They help me getting the vehicle in my expectation without any stress. I must say they are the best persons in this field. Also I didn't have to wait too much time to get approved and process was in very reasonable time. The hospitality was awesome. Mr.Islam also make sure that everything's all good in our end by following up later. That was so generous. Wish every other company have the same work nature and environment like the Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek have. I wish Mr. Islam and Mr Martin both all the best for their bright future with all happiness. Also would like to thank you Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek entire unit for their pleasant and comfort hospitality. Thank you all once again.. 😊

I purchased my car from out of state and had it shipped to me. After agreeing to purchase the car, it took a week for them to get the paperwork to me to sign, then another week before the car was shipped.  When I received the car, there was no paperwork so I had no documentation showing that I owned the car (and another week later I still have not received the documentation from the dealer and am not able to register the car).  I am very happy with the car, however customer service has been less than satisfactory.</text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>I have always had excellent service at Steven's Creek Mercedes, BUT this last experience was less than caliber for Mercedes standards. I had a recall that I was told would be completed in 2-3 hours. I dropped my car off at 9:30am and asked for a shuttle to Santana Row - less than 2 miles away. They said they would call when complete and come get me. At 12:30 I still did not receive a phone call or text. I called and they directed my call to the service department only to be sent directly to voice mail. I left a message.  I waited almost an hour and called again AND again I was sent to voice mail. It was now 2:00pm and I was stranded and tired. I called again and was put in cue - I was 4th in line. I waited almost 1/2 hour to speak to a live person AND my battery was on low mode. When the receptionist answered I said "please don't hang up and please don't direct me to any other person - I need help - I am stranded." The receptionist was great and  took care of me and reassured me during the call that she would not hang up on me. She had a shuttle to me in 15 minutes and my car was ready when I got there. A 2-3 hour service took 5 hours and NO CALL!. I will never ask for a shuttle again.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798<//gmap_id></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I am very happy to get my 2019 GLA 250. It's all because of help by Mr. Islam who was our salesperson and Manager Mr. Martin. They both were very nice and very helpful, indeed very friendly as well. They help me getting the vehicle in my expectation without any stress. I must say they are the best persons in this field. Also I didn't have to wait too much time to get approved and process was in very reasonable time. The hospitality was awesome. Mr.Islam also make sure that everything's all good in our end by following up later. That was so generous. Wish every other company have the same work nature and environment like the Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek have. I wish Mr. Islam and Mr Martin both all the best for their bright future with all happiness. Also would like to thank you Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek entire unit for their pleasant and comfort hospitality. Thank you all once again.. 😊
Simply the Best ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I don't trust this company. Horrible purchase experience, then slight redemption from their service forman who was genuinely an honest person, but then my front bumper was damaged while in their shop. They never told me about it, just covered it up, buffed it out (poorly), waxed the car. I am still rubbing wax off my car months later. I am due for my 10k service. Just cancelled the appt. Awful realization that I just don't trust them.</Review>

Had a small hiccup during the final process of the deal.
However, that hiccup was dealt swiftly by the management team both on the sales and on the finance side to fix the problem.
Courteous sales person and finance manager and got it back together.

Hiccups are sometime unavoidable but the willingness and courteous gesture to help me, as a 3rd time customer, was excellent.

Very happy.< /Text>

<Text>Ellen Lans was very efficient and professional.  Excellent communication throughout the purchase and after. She welcomed us very well on the first day and especially responsive by text and phone.
She scheduled Neil to go over the car with us and he did an amazing job. Would work with her again in the future.  Highly recommended!
Thank you very much Ellen. You are the best.</Text>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Five star experience all the way! I recently moved to the Bay Area for a new job and needed a small car to commute during the week. I did my research and narrowed it down to three small SUV type cars which included the MB GLA 250. It was the most expensive car in my lineup and thus I did not really believe it would be the one I would get.
I first went to the Nissan dealership but was disappointed that the advertised offer did not match the reality - in both the car they showed me and the cost. As it was late in the evening I planned on continuing my search the next day but on my way home passed the MB of Stevens Creek dealership and stopped to basically cross it off the list.
The car sales person that approached me was very professional and no pressure at all. I told him the car I wanted, my budget, and what I was looking for in monthly payments. After talking to his management team he came back with an offer that was within my parameters (largely due to the unexpected discount I received through my employer)  which was great and best of all there were no “hidden fees” - everything was disclosed and transparent. After agreeing and signing the contract I had the discussion with the finance person who was to my surprise a very pleasant experience - partly due to the fact that it was done super fast. I was able to drive off the lot within less then 2 hours of greeting the sales person which was a new record for me. Since I had a rental car that I needed to return to the San Jose airport I got a free ride from them and they waited and returned me back to my new car at MB Stevens Creek. Based on my experience I can only recommend this car dealership.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Service was awesome!  Jake and every person I dealt with at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek were worth 10 stars!  I would recommend them to anyone for service without hesitation!!

However, my next comment pertains specifically to MBUSA and has *nothing* to do with anyone or anything pertaining to Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek.

I currently drive a SL63, my last Mercedes was an E63.  I have extensive experience with other high end, luxury and exotic car manufacturers.  This was my first experience with any real warranty work from MBUSA.  Where other manufacturers that I have experience with tend to go out of their way to try to get everything they can covered under the bumper to bumper warranty as a way to build good will with the customer, it was my experience that MBUSA's policy is sadly just the opposite.  I will admit MBUSA's policy is perhaps more beneficial to the corporate balance sheet short term, I question the long term benefits.  The diagnostic feeS in particular are just insulting knowing how much I paid for my cars.  I'd hope one day corporate Mercedes would recognize acts of good will, while perhaps short term costly, would go a long way to building a long term customer base and profits.  I actually felt sorry for the great people at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek for having to enforce the corporate warranty policy.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Then I got a phone call that my advisor wasn't going to be at work on Monday, but he could sign it off on Tuesday, morning which I was fine with. Come Tuesday I never got a call to pick up the car, so I went there and it wasn't done yet.  I had to leave town on Wednesday, so I told him my fiance would pick it up on Wednesday. She took time off work to do so, but the call never came. I called from where I was, but It wasn't ready. So, she then had to go on Thursday. There was a lot of miscommunication and promised timelines that were not met. It was disappointing.<//Review>< Pics>

I brought over my car for an engine issue. My car end up staying there for almost a month for an engine replacement. My service guy Raul was the BEST. I was informed by him about the status of the car the whole time and he was supper helpful and on top of things. The only disappointed that I had was I got my car back supper dirty. Like they didn't bother to  wash the car that was sitting there for almost a month , also they had to test drive my car for a day or two and my gas light turned on right when I left the service department (. Over all my service was good but I was expecting to get a clean and washed car.< /Review>

I booked a service for 10:10am at MB of Stevens Creek for my airbag recall.  It was very good when I got there a few minutes earlier, a gentleman greeted me and took me to the reception counter.  He also asked my name and told me my regular service guy was absent that day but they will find me another person.  I then checked the car in, and waited in the waiting area hoping my service person will show up and tell me the estimated time so I can plan for the rest of the day. I waited and waited, nobody showed up.  It’s now 11:30am so I went to the reception and asked what’s going on.  It turned out the newly assigned service person was absent that morning.  I was given a name card and told I should call that person if I don’t receive a call by 2:00pm.  So I took a shuttle to my friend’s home.  I called around 2:20pm as I didn’t receive a call.  I got a voicemail.  At 3:30 I finally received a call from my service person. He told me the car won’t be ready that day but next morning.  I wasn’t offered any loaner car.  I was thinking how I can get home that day and I need a car for next day so I called back.  Voicemail again.  I called the office wishing to ask if a loaner car is available but I was transferred to him and he didn’t pick up.  I had to go back to the dealer and talk to someone that I need a loaner.  Before I arrive, my service guy called and told me he was able to find a mechanic to work on it and it should be done after 5:00.  It’s after 4:30pm now so I was glad I didn’t need a loaner that day so after arriving at the dealer, I waited in the waiting area for the car to be ready.  It’s 6:00pm, nobody called me. I called my service person.  Nobody picked up my call.  I thought since it started late, maybe it’s taking time so I waited.  6:30pm, still no call.  I went to the reception (thanks God they are still there) and asked if my car is ready.  They found the paperwork from the pile.  It’s been there since when?  I was expecting someone calls me when it’s done!!!  I wasted my whole day waiting for the airbag to be replaced.  There is no coffee or water in the waiting area.  This is the worst service I received from MB of Stevens Creek. My husband also complained about its service.  I am seriously thinking to get a Japanese car next time as their dealer’s service is much better.  The management, please think how to improve your processes, keep your customer informed and happy!< /Text>

<name>Trina Burt< /name><date>1469805514769< /date><rate>3</rate><text>My service adviser Danny Ho is great- super friendly and on top of things.  But the loss of stars is because their prices are just ridiculous, even for a dealership.  They wanted $170 to replace an $18 part which was 5 minutes of work.  They wanted almost $500 for the cheap mesh piece on the front bumper.  I found that part for $60 and it also was about 5 minutes worth of work.
And the wash job on my car was horrible.  Rims were still very dirty and the windows were worse than when I brought them in.  There was a film left on them that I couldn't see through.  Had to clean them when I got home.  And I waited almost 10 minutes for them to bring my car, watching other people who came after me all get their car before me.  The girl at the valet desk was less than helpful and said I have no idea where he is when asked where the valet for my car went.  She couldn't even be bothered to look up from her phone to help me.
I've purchased my car here and have had it serviced at this dealership exclusively for 10 years.  I don't think that will continue after my last experience.</text>< Pics>

I was informed by him about the status of the car the whole time and he was supper helpful and on top of things. The only disappointed that I had was I got my car back supper dirty. Like they didn't bother to  wash the car that was sitting there for almost a month , also they had to test drive my car for a day or two and my gas light turned on right when I left the service department (.

I waited for about a month after I purchased my car to post a review to make sure there were no issues and I was completely satisfied, which is exactly the case. I worked with Bill and he was excellent. He talked me through various queries and made sure I had a great experience throughout (and even after) my purchase. Aaron talked with me about financing options and was equally helpful and informative. Overall a very positive experience and i couldn’t be happier with my purchase!<//text>

I have to say I am highly impressed with my overall experience. This is the 1st time I have owned a Mercedes and utilized service @ Stevens Creek Mercedes. That said, I have to say this interaction was phenomenal end to end. From making the appointment, getting a loaner vehicle, to work rendered. More importantly, I want to specifically call out Edwin Luna (Service Advisor). He truly defines Customer Support and goes above and beyond to help his Customers! He was always professional, communicated when needed, articulated what needed to be done, and was genuine in nature. Likewise, he had a few of the Technicians (Ben, Archie, etc) come out and look at a few of the issues I identified as well. They were extremely knowledgeable and also went above and beyond to answer my questions. Overall, "top notch", service is a definite differentiator and being this was my 1st experience I was extremely satisfied and plan on bringing my vehicle there from now on.<//text>

This review describes the service drop-off appointment only - will update as the engagement progresses.

Condescending service rep.
I prepared a list of items I needed help with - his first response without reviewing the list was that it would cost over $2000 for them to look at the issues. He was reminding me obsessively of how much each item would cost to diagnose as we were going through the list as if alluding to my not being well off enough to be able to pay for it. Pricing is not in question - they decide what to charge (even though why would one charge for a full hour in case diagnostics take 3 minutes to complete?) It was the attitude of the service rep that was unacceptable - he was not particularly respectful overall, somewhat abrupt, and clearly wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible. When I said I might not have an insurance card with me (which I ended up finding shortly thereafter), he immediately said, "you cannot get a loaner then". A truly helpful attitude. Not. Not an smile, not a how are you, not a thank you - nothing.

A "why am I here?" lady at the loaner car station.
She looked as if she was really unhappy about being there and having to work with all these annoying customers who wanted something from her. Uninterested and unwelcoming. Put more gas on the loaner form than the loaner actually had in it. Did grace me with a smile on my way out, though.

All in all - way far from an experience I expected from a Mercedes dealership or any customer-friendly place. I needed to stop by a CVS after dropping off the car and, ironically, the polite and welcoming treatment from a CVS cashier was in stark contrast to the experience I had at Mercedes Stevens Creek.</Text>

The Stevens Creek location is nice and clean. The worked performed on my car was complete and correct. But there is something important that this dealership is missing and that is their customer service. Owning a Mercedes should be a great experience. This is a world-class car. From the moment you make the maintenance phone call to the time you pick up your car, you should feel confirmed that you have made the right choice in buying/leasing this car because you feel that the company really values your business. My wife owns a BMW and when I walk into that dealership, I say to myself..."Yes, I am at BMW". The smiles, the immediate greeting with a hand shake and a bottled water, the conversations about the car and how important it is for them to know that I still love driving a BMW, as they walk me right to the loaner car. I am taken from person to person with care. Never standing around, wondering what's going on now. This is leaps above my experience at Mercedes. We should expect more and we deserve more. This is  Mercedes!< /Text>

<Text>I came in for my service appointment and realized I came a week too early on a Saturday early morning.  I was told they had no availability but I think Edwin the assistant manager overheard the conversation and came out to my car and said he could get me in right away.  He was able to provide me with a loaner car and my car was completed in a few hours.  What fantastic customer service! Thanks Edwin!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Five star experience all the way! I recently moved to the Bay Area for a new job and needed a small car to commute during the week. I did my research and narrowed it down to three small SUV type cars which included the MB GLA 250. It was the most expensive car in my lineup and thus I did not really believe it would be the one I would get.
I first went to the Nissan dealership but was disappointed that the advertised offer did not match the reality - in both the car they showed me and the cost. As it was late in the evening I planned on continuing my search the next day but on my way home passed the MB of Stevens Creek dealership and stopped to basically cross it off the list.
The car sales person that approached me was very professional and no pressure at all. I told him the car I wanted, my budget, and what I was looking for in monthly payments. After talking to his management team he came back with an offer that was within my parameters (largely due to the unexpected discount I received through my employer)  which was great and best of all there were no “hidden fees” - everything was disclosed and transparent. After agreeing and signing the contract I had the discussion with the finance person who was to my surprise a very pleasant experience - partly due to the fact that it was done super fast. I was able to drive off the lot within less then 2 hours of greeting the sales person which was a new record for me. Since I had a rental car that I needed to return to the San Jose airport I got a free ride from them and they waited and returned me back to my new car at MB Stevens Creek. Based on my experience I can only recommend this car dealership.<//Text>

Bringing my car in for routine service at Mercedes-Benz was a very pleasant experience!! From the moment I arrived, I was met with friendly staff that immediately notified my Service Advisor Danny Ho I was present.  Mr. Ho attended to my concerns and questions and took time to explain in detail the process for servicing my car.  As always, he was thorough, attentive, accommodating, clear with explanations, and reassuring me that all of my concerns would be addressed. I am able to reach him if I have any questions and he always returns my calls. I feel at ease and confident that my car is in good hands with his service.< /review>

After some back and forth about what can be done to get the 2nd key, our sales advisor- Ellen offered to get us a genuine VW key cut and programmed from VW dealership across the road. Due to holidays and such the process take a little bit and I had to reach out to them a few times. But Ellen made sure we got the 2nd key which she promised to us.

Came in for a recall service. Appointment was at 8:50, it was supposed to take 2-3 hours. I told them I need the car by 1 and they said that shouldn't be a problem. I called to see if it was ready at 12:30. I left a message and an hour later they called to say it would be another hour and a half. I walked around the lot to see my car sitting there not being worked on. I ran into the mechanic who told me he was just coming to get it and it would be another hour or more. Ugh! I left my service advisor a message that I was not happy to find my car in the lot and that I was in the lobby waiting. 40 minutes have gone by and no one has approached me about the situation. I'm writing this from the lobby right now. If scheduling the appointment wasn't so easy this would be a ONE star review.< /Text>

I have bought several cars from several upscale dealerships but i think this one tops them all.
Mark was an amazing sales person who was not pushy and made sure we were comfortable.
Stan on the other hand is probably the best manager I have ever came across in any dealership.
He took the time to work with us and had an amazing attitude.

Overall I think this was the best car buying experience I have ever had.
I am a customer for life....< /Text>

I have purchased my new E350 Convertible from Mr. Martin Do who provided his best effort for my decision. It took almost a day to compare several models before the final decision. This is my second time of purchase of Mercedes after long fan of BMW in past 5 years. Do you know all new E350 had great changes for the interior and performance? I have moved from BMW to Mercedes because of the great changes. Now I have everyday nice nice and fun driving thanks for Martin.<//Review>

The temporary registration I was given is incomplete and a bill of sale was not provided. I went back and all you would give me is a copy of the application to transfer title. Because of this I can’t use this car for work until the DMV send me a legitimate registration with the existing plate numbers. On top of this the car broke down after 4 days and I had to have it towed back to Mercedes, they said they would look at it but now I will be outside of the 5 day return policy, I am very upset with Mercedes of Stevens creek and I am not vining my Mercedes here for service and will tell anyone I know to avoid this place.

Update:
I just spoke with Kevin the GM and he was quite helpful and reassuring. Said that he will look into the mechanical issue with the car to see what can be done to fix it and will extend the 5 day return period.  I hope it all works out.

2nd Update:
Got a call Saturday that my car was ready for pickup. Was told it was an aftermarket alarm system that they removed and car was working fine. I drove it home, reset the auto door locks to all open when the key remote unlock is pressed, then the car wouldn’t start anymore!

Returned the car and was told I would be getting a check in one week, great they took it back but I really don’t understand why I need to wait one week to get paid. When I bought it I paid in full before I drove it off the lot, I didn’t tell them I’d stop back in a week and give them a check. I wish I never went to Stevens Creek Mercedes in the first place.

3rd Update:
Went back on 1/27 Monday to get my check they said they could only pay me for my trade-in. Had me sign several blank DMV forms, wait 2hrs still wouldn’t give me any of my money for the trade-in or the purchase price of the returned car.
Shawn the head of finance said they would print the checks Tuesday and next day them to me for Wednesday.....
Wednesday 1/29 still no check.
Not sure what to do, this dealership seems very dishonest they can’t tell me when they will return my money and are continuing to string me along.
I think I will go to the DMV tomorrow and see if they can help me recover my two cars that they seem to have taken and refused to pay for.

4th Update:
Friday 1/31, no check in the mail yet so I drove back to Stevens Creek Mercedes. Great news! they had the check for the car I returned (dated 1/28, not sure why they never mailed it).
I still need to wait for the check for my trade-in.

They still have not payed me for my trade in. Over 6 months since returning the purchased car and asking for their 5 day 250 mile return refund. Again after several weeks they did return the cash I paid but still have NOT paid for the trade-in car I sold them!< /text>

My experience was fantastic. My service representative was Danny Ho. Danny was knowledgeable, professional and easy to work with. I NEVER felt like I was being taken advantage of like at other places. The work was done in a timely manner. The car was washed when I picked it up. A great experience all around by a team that gained my trust. I live in the Peninsula but will make the drive to Stevens Creek Mercedes Benz for all my future needs.< /review>

The experience here is truly 5 star from start to finish, every person I worked with was highly competent and charming to work with - and truly went the extra mile for the customer. Rare these days to find a place that values their customers like they do. What a team! Will be driving extra for this level of service.</text>

<Review>Visited the dealership with my wife against the advise of my good friend who said MB of Stevens creek does not treat client with respect and waste peoples time.
Anyways we visited the dealership looking to lease a new SUV, we met-up Carlos who helped us and took us for a test drive. We asked Carlos to provide us pricing for 4 different model with different packages, we waited in his office for 1/2 hour. After 1/2 hour Carlos came back with his co worker Amir and without introduction and attitude he started to say.. i am not sure what was discussed let's start over. we wasted 1 and 1/2 hour with Carlos going over the things and color that was important to us, now we had to start all over again. When my wife and i  started to share our frustration with new associate he said we are raising our voice at him and that he does not understand what happen been discussed and pulls one page from the folder with random car and started going over lease prices with us. This is not my first time buying car and i can honestly say this was the worst experience of my life with a dealership of this magnitude, ANY ONE Looking for nice SUV please visit Walnut Creek Mercedes Benz Store, the employees asked questions, listened to thing that were important and even offered snacks for my 2 year child who was getting hungry. I DO NOT recommend MB of Stevens Creek and request people to go elsewhere if they want to get treated well and do not want to waste their time. NO RESPECT fro your business at this location and i will continue to share with my friends and family to avoid this place.<//Review>< user_id>

<Review>The temporary registration I was given is incomplete and a bill of sale was not provided. I went back and all you would give me is a copy of the application to transfer title. Because of this I can’t use this car for work until the DMV send me a legitimate registration with the existing plate numbers. On top of this the car broke down after 4 days and I had to have it towed back to Mercedes, they said they would look at it but now I will be outside of the 5 day return policy, I am very upset with Mercedes of Stevens creek and I am not vining my Mercedes here for service and will tell anyone I know to avoid this place.

Update:
I just spoke with Kevin the GM and he was quite helpful and reassuring. Said that he will look into the mechanical issue with the car to see what can be done to fix it and will extend the 5 day return period.  I hope it all works out.

2nd Update:
Got a call Saturday that my car was ready for pickup. Was told it was an aftermarket alarm system that they removed and car was working fine. I drove it home, reset the auto door locks to all open when the key remote unlock is pressed, then the car wouldn’t start anymore!

Returned the car and was told I would be getting a check in one week, great they took it back but I really don’t understand why I need to wait one week to get paid.

<text>Bryan Tu was amazing!  He went to the ends of the earth to find my C63 S in the color and features I wanted. Bryan followed up on a regular basis to give me updates.  He provided white glove service when the car came in.  He has an incredible attention to detail, a subject matter expert in not on Mercedes, but my particular car.  He gave me tremendous info on the features of the car, walked me through everything and made me aware of features that some dealerships do not.  Overall the dealership and the service is amazing!

We purchased a car At Mercedes of Steven's Creek recently. This car has many incredible safety and navigation features, including Android Auto Capability, but there is a learning curve on these things. The dealership has a Concierge who walks you through how to use your complex new car. Christian was excellent, and we can go back as many times as we need to. He is the "genius bar" for Mercedes. The dealership has an ultra clean modern feel, with free hot drinks, multiple lounges, and loaner cars for when you get your car serviced.</review>

The worst service I've ever experienced in my life, ordered from rim, paid $1865 for one rim, wen to a tire service, turned out they ordered a rare rim, when I brought it back the guy who made mistake tried to convince me that I said I needed a rare rim.
WTF? Asked to reimburse me money I paid for service, he rejected, I had to talk to the general manager. Terrible service, I will never use Mercedes Benz on Stevens Creek, Blvd again.<//Review>

<response>None</response><text>I'm giving three stars as a neutral rating due to the following reasons:

1) My technician has always been great and has constantly kept me in the loop with my repairs/ service, pricing, promotions, etc. All the work done on my car has been great and he was a pleasure to work with.

2) Any time I have had any interaction with the front desk receptionists, I have been met with hostile attitudes. As a Mercedes-Benz customer of over two years, the rudeness has been a constant. When I ask any question at all, I am talked down to and spoken to like a child. Not appreciated.<//text>< Rate>

Always reliable and awesone service, although not always the cheapest.  But you get good value and genuine Mercedes parts, and a good labor warranty.  Love that you can still get a loaner car, something that other dealers are going away from it seems lately.< /Text>

<Review>My service adviser Danny Ho is great- super friendly and on top of things.  But the loss of stars is because their prices are just ridiculous, even for a dealership.  They wanted $170 to replace an $18 part which was 5 minutes of work.  They wanted almost $500 for the cheap mesh piece on the front bumper.  I found that part for $60 and it also was about 5 minutes worth of work.
And the wash job on my car was horrible.  Rims were still very dirty and the windows were worse than when I brought them in.  There was a film left on them that I couldn't see through.  Had to clean them when I got home.  And I waited almost 10 minutes for them to bring my car, watching other people who came after me all get their car before me.  The girl at the valet desk was less than helpful and said I have no idea where he is when asked where the valet for my car went.  She couldn't even be bothered to look up from her phone to help me.
I've purchased my car here and have had it serviced at this dealership exclusively for 10 years.  I don't think that will continue after my last experience.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Kamil worked with my vehicle want list and found me the exact one I was looking for.  I felt confident with my decision on the vehicle after going over the details with him.  This dealership is attentive to customer service and made the difficult task of purchasing a vehicle quite easy.<//text>

Both service rep gave me price about $500 plus tax, When I ask about Brake fluid service whether it is included with service or not, but they were not clear. When I came in for the service Service advisor, showed me the the charges will be $1500 and above, so I asked me why the so much discrepancy but he was not able to explain me clearly, When go in to the details, He was adding two three additional services and was trying to add the services not needed as part of B3 services. Still after removing those extra service my total was still above $711 plus tax.

Also did not experience Mercedes level experience at Service station. As there were so much line for loaner pick up and pick up car after service was done.

Why don't ask your General Manager ro call me if they care about my experience.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1570555089123, 'text': "Nilesh, we are deeply disappointed by your experience at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek.

<user_name>Beryl Fajardo< /user_name><review>The B1 service and rep were great, however, with an 8:30am appointment I still had to wait 50 minutes in line before my service rep was able to help me. They were so busy I had to leave my car overnight and luckily I had reserved a loaner (but only limited to 100 miles then they start charging you for mileage), not great if you have a long commute. I was also surprised the tire rotation was not covered in the regular pre-paid maintenance contract, so had to pay extra $96.< /review>< date>

<Review>Sales is good. But their Customer service is pretty avg only. I called up to check my car's paint job status. I was bumped off from each Department - Customer service to Body Shop to Customer service and dropped off. Their Chat support has the worst etiquette. This lady Kristin just drops off on my chat, saying, its not my department. That too, after spending so much money. If you're looking for a good post sale service, avoid them. Manny was good guy. He helped a lot, but his CS Team is not able to back up his good job.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<rating>1<//rating><review>This review describes the service drop-off appointment only - will update as the engagement progresses.

Condescending service rep.
I prepared a list of items I needed help with - his first response without reviewing the list was that it would cost over $2000 for them to look at the issues. He was reminding me obsessively of how much each item would cost to diagnose as we were going through the list as if alluding to my not being well off enough to be able to pay for it. Pricing is not in question - they decide what to charge (even though why would one charge for a full hour in case diagnostics take 3 minutes to complete?) It was the attitude of the service rep that was unacceptable - he was not particularly respectful overall, somewhat abrupt, and clearly wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible. When I said I might not have an insurance card with me (which I ended up finding shortly thereafter), he immediately said, "you cannot get a loaner then". A truly helpful attitude. Not. Not an smile, not a how are you, not a thank you - nothing.

A "why am I here?" lady at the loaner car station.
She looked as if she was really unhappy about being there and having to work with all these annoying customers who wanted something from her. Uninterested and unwelcoming. Put more gas on the loaner form than the loaner actually had in it. Did grace me with a smile on my way out, though.

All in all - way far from an experience I expected from a Mercedes dealership or any customer-friendly place. I needed to stop by a CVS after dropping off the car and, ironically, the polite and welcoming treatment from a CVS cashier was in stark contrast to the experience I had at Mercedes Stevens Creek.</review>< Name>

<review>Dropping the vehicle for B5 service was smooth. Their shuttle service is not the best because to drop me at my work (Near SJC airport) took 2.5 hours (including wait time) -- I understand there are so many customers wanting the shuttle service and only few cars.

My assigned service tech told that my car would be ready in 3 hours but ended up calling me again and said it wouldn't be ready till tomorrow. Next day I got a call again from the tech saying that my car was ready and it's being washed at the moment.

I went to pick up my car assuming it serviced and cleaned -- but shocked to see that it was not washed and more dirtier than how I left inside out. I asked the person who delivered my car about it, he said he didn't know anything and asked me to contact my assigned tech who was not there (?!)

I mean, come on, I am dropping my car for a complete service and experience. The tech lied that my car was being washed. Sorry but the dirtier look with extra bird droppings didn't make me feel that my car has been serviced completely.

When MB of San Jose serviced my car previously it was perfect, I thought to give MB of Steven Creek a chance as it's closer to my home but they completely screwed it with the delivery of my car, service quality and the response. Never going back to MB of Stevens Creek.<//review></record>

Twice now, I have seen a used car for sale and made repeated inquiries about a test drive: not ready, not ready, sorry sold! As I am calling and ready to drive cars days before the car is sold, On my most recent selection, I had a salesman checking daily. Patrick just texted me to say, after I contacted him on Sat., he was off on Sun and Mon: told no one of my interest in car!< /Review>

I have bought several cars from several upscale dealerships but i think this one tops them all.
Mark was an amazing sales person who was not pushy and made sure we were comfortable.
Stan on the other hand is probably the best manager I have ever came across in any dealership.
He took the time to work with us and had an amazing attitude.

Overall I think this was the best car buying experience I have ever had.
I am a customer for life....<//review>

I have purchased my new E350 Convertible from Mr. Martin Do who provided his best effort for my decision. It took almost a day to compare several models before the final decision. This is my second time of purchase of Mercedes after long fan of BMW in past 5 years. Do you know all new E350 had great changes for the interior and performance? I have moved from BMW to Mercedes because of the great changes. Now I have everyday nice nice and fun driving thanks for Martin.< /Text>

Disappointing service experience. Left tools and parts behind in engine compartment. Made a mess inside engine compartment (new vehicle). Did not perform expected 'pitstop'. Had to drag service rep through process of performing work under warranty which was documented by Mercedes in service bulletins. Can't see myself going back here again...<//review>

Steve Kirksey of AutoNation Stevens Creek did the most incredible job for me when it came time to turn in my old leased vehicle and then procure my
next C-Class.  Steve's attention to each and every detail made it a seamless
transaction on turn-in, and he found the perfect "new" vehicle for me and
completed both transactions before we had to leave on extended vacation out of the country.

His professionalism is second to none; hopefully he is fully appreciated by
your company.

Long-time customer...

I had a terrific car buying experience here thanks to Solmaz, Safi and Nick. The whole process was seamless and pleasant with Solmaz being one of the best car sales people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. If you're going to purchase a used car or a new one from here I recommend working with these 3 if you have the opportunity as they created a terrific experience. Thank you so much Solmaz, Safi and Nick.

UPDATE!!!Upon purchasing my car from this dealership they had verbally agreed to provide me with a second key for the vehicle I purchased from them and did not follow through on this. Now while desperately in need of a second key for relocating the vehicle the dealership has gone radio silent when asking for them to follow up on this promise. Really disappointed with this dealership and commitment to the full delivery of service. I don’t think getting two sets of keys for a car is too much to ask when buying a vehicle from a dealership. Disappointing given the purchase process upfront and would no longer endorse this dealership for end to end service.</text>

3.0 star rating 2/27/2019   Updated review
So a year later I scheduled the B service maintenance and was told they would need the car for 4 to 6 hrs. I therefore scheduled a loaner car again. When I got to the service intake area I sat in a line and watched as cars in front of me were greeted by service writers. I started to notice that the service writers were attending to the cars behind me as well. "Be patient"  I said to myself, they are very busy. After another 20 min I was the only one sitting in a car. Hmmm. I went inside to inquire at the service desk and was asked who my service rep was. When I mentioned Joseph's name I was informed that he no longer works for Stevens Creek Mercedes. ???? So this was supposed to explain why no one approached my vehicle??? They eventually got someone to check me in. "Nate", told me that there were no more loaner vehicles available. I mentioned that I had confirmed the loaner the day before and he apologized explaining that they only have so many loaners and if customers do not return them when expected they run out. I live in Santa Cruz and had an important medical treatment in the early afternoon. I asked what options were available but was met with a blank stare. He did offer to reschedule but I did not want to go through that commute hassle again, rain, accidents and all. To his credit Nate did offer to fast track the maintenance and indicated that he might be able to have it before noon. The car was ready at 11:30 and that worked for me. So three stars for courtesy and fast service, minus one star for stiffing me on the loaner, minus another star for leaving me sitting with no service rep assigned. In future I will be looking for other options when I need service.</Text>

<review>Team was great for the service.  Great job

feedback that is not a reflection on the team that helped but an issue.  Our car had a recall for an airbag replacement, when I asked if the recall was done while in for the service the answer was No.  the answer was the airbag wasn't available - I found it odd to inform us of a recall and then not have the part ready when we come in for a service appointment.

The stars is a reflection of the recall situation<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Bringing my car in for routine service at Mercedes-Benz was a very pleasant experience!! From the moment I arrived, I was met with friendly staff that immediately notified my Service Advisor Danny Ho I was present.  Mr. Ho attended to my concerns and questions and took time to explain in detail the process for servicing my car.  As always, he was thorough, attentive, accommodating, clear with explanations, and reassuring me that all of my concerns would be addressed. I am able to reach him if I have any questions and he always returns my calls. I feel at ease and confident that my car is in good hands with his service.</text>

I expected to be treated with some class with the amount of money I was considering spending (six figures). These sales people take it for granted and treat people like they're at a dmv. Management really should take a closer look at the interactions between their customers and salesmen. I ran a successful business for 45 years and I would be very upset if I knew my customers were being mistreated.<//Review>

Jake, the service advisor was excellent. He kept me updated everyday on the status of my car and he did not give up in trying to replicate one of the issues that I had complained about. The shop foreman was not able to replicate it but Jake tried everything possible scenario to see if the problem did come up and eventually it did, which they fixed.</review>

It was serviced for a recall, I found out that they put 65psi wrong tire pressure on my car after service while I was driving.  It supposed to be 45psi, I got really scared while driving. They put your customer life in danger, what if the tires blows on the road, and I have passengers in my car.</Text>

<text>STAY AWAY!!!! My entire experience with Mercedes-Benz of Steven's Creek has been a nightmare!  These people sell defective cars and do not care about people's safety!! I wish I could give less than a star!

I purchased a second-hand Subaru from the dealership that included a 90 day warranty, and 5 day return policy. The car was sold to me as in perfect condition, with a clean CARFAX report.

On the drive home, I noticed the right mirror shaking dangerously - the whole plastic casing was broken. I brought the car back immediately and requested a return as I didn't want other undisclosed problems down the line. They convinced me to keep it and assured me they would repair it and do a full inspection. My new car was in service the whole first week I had it. Said inspection came out showing everything in perfect condition.

A month later, I went for an oil change at Subaru and asked for a multi-point inspection because the car didn't feel right and had been making lots of strange sounds. The report showed that the front axel needed immediate attention. I had had the car for just a month at this point, and was still covered by the warranty. I checked, and axel parts are covered in their limited warranty.

I tried contacting Mercedes-Benz of Steven's Creek every day and only got unreturned voicemails. I had to drive twice from Santa Cruz to San Jose just to be able to talk to someone, and kept being bounced around between sales and servicing. I was told that this was actually a pre-existing condition they had been aware of, but had concealed to me. Only the threat of legal action got them to actually listen and eventually take my car into service.

When I got my car back, it sounded and felt even worse than before! I drove halfway down the street and immediately turned back. I asked the technicians to test drive it down the street with me or just simply just listen to the car and they told me to come back as they were closing.

I went straight back to Subaru for a full inspection and they told me the axel had been replaced with an even worse condition after market one that was leaking grease, that the rotors were now out of round, problems with the wheel bearings, and shake and vibration at all speeds including when the vehicle is stopped. Instead of repairing it, Mercedes-Benz Steven's Creek only further damaged my car, causing $2000 worth of damages, while still under their warranty.

The steering wheel and paddles shake when braking and it feels like the axel might break at any moment cause a big accident, and feels very unsafe to drive. I haven't really been able to use my car since they "repaired" it.

I have all the paperwork and proof showing their wrongdoings and will be taking this to court. You'd think that a business using the name of Mercedes-Benz would uphold some sort of standard, but the service here is appalling - avoid this business at all cost if you value your safety!!!!</text>< GmapID>

< Review>
Dropping the vehicle for B5 service was smooth. Their shuttle service is not the best because to drop me at my work (Near SJC airport) took 2.5 hours (including wait time) -- I understand there are so many customers wanting the shuttle service and only few cars.

My assigned service tech told that my car would be ready in 3 hours but ended up calling me again and said it wouldn't be ready till tomorrow. Next day I got a call again from the tech saying that my car was ready and it's being washed at the moment.

I went to pick up my car assuming it serviced and cleaned -- but shocked to see that it was not washed and more dirtier than how I left inside out. I asked the person who delivered my car about it, he said he didn't know anything and asked me to contact my assigned tech who was not there (?!)

I mean, come on, I am dropping my car for a complete service and experience. The tech lied that my car was being washed. Sorry but the dirtier look with extra bird droppings didn't make me feel that my car has been serviced completely.

When MB of San Jose serviced my car previously it was perfect, I thought to give MB of Steven Creek a chance as it's closer to my home but they completely screwed it with the delivery of my car, service quality and the response. Never going back to MB of Stevens Creek.<//Review>

<review>We bought a car from Steven’s Creek Mercedes about 3 weeks ago.

First impression. My prior to purchase experience with the internet sales manager who’s name is Val Estrada was nice. Since I’m not from the Bay Area, Val sent me some additional pictures of the car and answered to all my emails in a timely manner. Once we came to test drive the car she was knowledgeable and not pushy.

Second thoughts. Once Val transferred me and my husband to the finance manager Peter Nguen all the hell began. First off, he messed the financing period and instead of requested 48 months financing, he specified 60 months. Secondly, he was very pushy. This is not our first experience buying a car from Autonation and we’re more than happy with their network. And obviously we know all their maintenance  and additional coverage options, that we didn’t want to purchase for this particular car. It was 6PM and we told him that we need to drive 4 hours back home, that we know everything about Autonation plans and we don’t want any of those options and we want to close the deal ASAP. He continued calculated something and showing us the potential advantages for freaking 2 hours. Once we insisted that we didn’t want anything he changed his face, became very upset and angry. I understand that he didn’t receive his commission from the car plans, but c’mon guys, you should be better in making poker face! It was so rude and unpleasant.

Moreover, once we were done with the financial devil, we came outside to pick up our car and noticed that:
It didn’t have a second key;
It didn’t have a service record and Mercedes Benz book;
The wind deflector (the small backseat screen of convertibles) has a huge hole in it. When we were test driving the car it was perfect. I believe the guys who cleaned the car damaged it.
Val made a few pictures and promised to get back to me with everything, but it’s been 3 weeks and I haven’t received any of them yet.
Shame on you, Autonation of Steven’s Creek…< /review>< user>

<Review>Great service experience in general until I went to pick up my car and this young lady looked like she was having a real bad day.  Not good for business when the last person you interact with has attitude.
She might need some training or a vacation.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Went into MB stevens creek to check out a 2018 certified pre-owned E300 last Sunday.
I was helped by Jugbhir Singh from Internet Sales.
He is knowledgable about the spec of the car, honest and super friendly with no traditional car salesman pressure. We felt extremely comfortable and decided to pull the trigger on the same day.
Jugbhir also did a great job in following up after the sales to make sure i have no problem/questions about my new ride, which is not that normal for traditional car salesman.
I’ve bought about 5 cars in different dealers in the past 10 years, and this was truly one of my best car shopping experience!<//text>

This dealer may be good for Mercedes autos but if you have a sprinter van they treat you like second class citizens.  We were traveling and needed help with our sprinter van and loaner and they told us that they did not provide loaners for customers who have purchased sprinter vans and they were short and could care less about our predicament.    Don’t waste your time go to Fremont Mercedes,  they were great.< /Review>

I went in for a 30K service for my C class.

The check in was as per the expectations. Quick and easy.

However there were two major problems later in the day.

Service delays - It took 7.5 hours to service what should have taken up to 2 hours. Service Quality/Trust - The receipt says that the tires were pressure checked and filled up, but I saw that all four tires were low on pressure (at the same level I dropped the car at). Given that this was marked done but was not really done, I cannot trust if other services were performed as per the standards.<//review>

<review>Getting an appointment was easy... but felt like the advisor was not receptive to the problem that I described... Also the one thing that a customer sees after a vehicle has been serviced is the quality of wash and detailing... if that's not good (which in my case it was not.. I had to ask for a re-wash.).. makes me wonder about the quality of service which the customer cant see and judge!! Something to think about for Mercedes...

-----
UPDATE:
Added a star for advisor.
Went in again different advisor Jake(much better than before)... still disappointed with the wash... maybe my expectations are too high??<//review></record></dataset><record>

Eddie Eduardo is a great sales guy. He has helped us in every step of the process while we were buying our latest car. We were just browsing, and he showed us few cars. This happened around 6pm. By time time we finished the paperwork it was 930, and he stayed with us all the time. Our son was hungry, he even gave us some of his own snacks. Thanks very much, great car buying experience. Steven's creek Mercedes is a great place, and Eddie is the one of the sales guys  you should be looking for.< /Review>

I always appreciate the attentiveness and helpfulness of Susan Sulimani.
She is very efficient taking the time to check out my SL550 to ask me what
my concerns are.  She follows up with a phone call letting me know when the car is ready.  She handles the check out process very smoothly and not
rushed.  All in all a great customer experience -- 5-stars!        Tom Claridge< /Text>

< review>
The store experience was really good. No issues there. But have an issue with Mercedes in general. I leased my car like 10 months back, there's hardly 6K miles on the car. But suddenly the air started to leak from one of the tires. Later found out that there was no puncture but a small crack in the rim. So i had to replace the RIM which costed me around 1.2K$'s. I have never seen this kind of issue in the past. Me and my parents owned a honda for more than 15 years now and it has more than 150K miles. We never saw any issue with the tire rim. The only reason I am posting this is because the dealer told me that rims usually crack or break if you go through a pot hole or something. No sir they don't i have not seen such kind of issue in the past that too on a brand new car within a year. The quality of the mercedes parts has depreceated a lot it seems then... nothing else.</review>

We had the perfect sales experience with Tony Spencer, a true gentleman.  He is extremely  knowledgeable about the product. He located the perfect vehicle and smoothly guided us through the sale. We were shown around the immaculate dealership and introduced to our service adviser. We have purchased many cars but this was our first Mercedes; it will not be the last.  We love the car and will be back.</text>

< Review>
I had the opportunity of working with Marvin Siquig at MBZ of Stevens Creek and I had a 5 star experience from the beginning of the process until the end. I actually had worked with Marvin a few years ago when I was doing a car search, but did not ended up purchasing a car at that time. I reached out again and he was happy to help and work with me and my family. What was incredible to me was the very open and transparent communication in addition to the 5 star service me, my wife, and my parents were treated to in every interaction. Marvin helped us with finding and letting us test drive multiple cars to be sure we knew exactly what we wanted. After that he helped find the exact car we were looking for. In completing the transaction all was hassle free, in my experience is never the case. Even when Marvin was not available to help, the entire staff at MBZ of Stevens Creek continued where Marvin left off with great communication and service. I really appreciate my purchase experience and will always consider MBZ of Stevens Creek first when I am thinking of a car purchase, thanks again!</Review>

<Review>update: 2/17/19 After more than 3 weeks of purchasing a car from MB Stevens Creek, I still haven't received my spare key nor owner's manual as promised at time of purchase. I've left 2 voicemails to the salesman, 1 to his manager and ended up reaching out to MB customer service directly to mediate as I cannot even get an answer from the dealership after the purchase. I tried reaching out to the GM as per the reply on this review and it's a generic number and am being told 'He isn't available'. Terrible buying experience, get anything you need upfront as they don't care about their customers after the check has been cashed.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1549999043861, 'text': "Hello, thank you for leaving this rating.

I have bought the car for 20 days and it has been with dealer repair service for the Check Engine light problem since day 7th. 2. Keyless Start/Stop cannot find key on the second day after purchasing the new car. I drove the car to the dealer to fix Keyless start/stop problem on the 4th day, but the service adviser cannot fix the problem. Since the car is still with dealer repair service for Check Engine problem, I don't know whether the Keyless start/stop problem is fixed.

<Date>1571695008293< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>We found the exact  color combo GLS 63 AMG that we had been looking for at Stevens Creek MB   I called and spoke with a very pleasant and attentive Sales Lady and arranged a day and time to fly out from my home in Texas for a look.  The car was a perfect CPO lease return. The purchase went quick and easy.   Another salesman assured me that he ships cars to Texas all the time and that all the paperwork would follow so I could pay taxes and register it in Texas.  That NEVER happened!
I could not register the car because they put in paperwork with the California DMV.  I got a sticker for the expired California plate that came on the vehicle.  So they sold me a car, shipped it to Texas, transferred the registration into my name in California with my Texas address and I never paid CA tax on it!   I called for 3 weeks and left messages with 5 different people and never got a single call back.  I was able to text my sales lady about not having the correct  paperwork, but she was unable to get anything done.  I called a manager at my local DMV and explained the situation.  She even called the dealership to try to get the needed documents and never got a call back.  I called MB customer service twice to file a complaint.  I told them the problem and they said that they would send an email to the Stevens Creek General Manager and I would get a call.  Never happened!
Finally, I called MB financial and they with the help of my local DMV Angel were able to send proof of ownership to the Texas DMV so I could register and DRIVE my new car.
I know that mistakes happen, but for not a single person at this inept dealership to call me to try to resolve the issue is absolutely inexcusable.  I’m appalled that a Mercedes dealership, or any other business would flat out ignore a customer.   Good news is the GLS 63 AMG is amazing, it finally has Texas plates on it, and I am so thankful I don’t have to deal with Stevens Creek MB ever again.</text>< Pictures>

I reached out to them for a quote online. Things were going smoothly over email initially. They responded quickly and said they have the model with my specs. They shared a quote and updated it soon too. We set an appointment for the same day evening. When I arrive in the evening, they say the car is a loaner car - they dont know how many miles is on it and they dont have it on the lot -  and that they emailed this information to me. The spec they shared said the car had 6 miles on it !

I have no email from either Sophie or her assistant Hanif Asad on this topic. She shows me an email Hanif sent to her without me in cc but addressed to me. She says Hanif forwarded it to her. When I ask for the original Hanif cant show me anything - says maybe it went to my junk folder. I have other emails from Hanif so it definitely didnt goto junk. Maybe he forgot to put my email in the To section.

Watch out for Sopheap San, Sales Manager and Asad Hanif
Sales Associate-eCommerce.

These guys just wanted to get me into the dealership to see if I want to check out other options in case I didn't like the loaner car !

Everyone's time is precious. Dealers should learn to respect this and cop up to mistakes if they do make them< /review>

Extremely courteous staff that wasn't pushy at any point in the process.  I worked with Manny who made sure to find the right car for me rather than try to push one on me that I might regret later.  Both Manny and Omar made going through the paperwork quick and easy.  After purchasing our car, Eric gave us a run-through to get us familiarized with all the car's features and make sure we could really enjoy our new car.  In the end, we're very pleased with our new car and the entire purchasing experience!</text>

We went to Benz showroom last weekend and got a wonderful service. Our sales person Eddie was very helpful and provided us with all the information we needed to make our decision. He was not pushy or arrogant at all (like other places I have seen). Same weekend we visited Lexus, BMW and Nissan and this one was far better experience than Lexus and BMW. I will definitely recommend this to my friends and family. They take enough time to explain to you about cars even if they are busy.<//review>

<Text>I recently moved to the U.S. with my wife in regards to work. I needed a vehicle suitable for my needs and we decided that we would go with the GLC. It wasn't until Hanif stepped in, and was able to communicate with us, he really understood what we needed, and provided us an offer we couldn't refuse . Within a matter of minutes, the deal was confirmed and we walked out of the door with a new vehicle thanks to him. We highly recommend him because he understands what people like us need and saves you time.< /Text>< Pics>

Disappointed that the experience was subpar when we brought in our GLA on Friday, Mar 13, 2020. We have been bringing our vehicle to this Service Center since I purchased the GLA in Dec 2016. We have never received such bad customer service from multiple areas (Service Advisor, Front Desk, Finance). My husband had a few questions about a comp pit-stop service (which I received an email about from Mercedes-Benz) which no one seemed to have any idea about and inquiring about a prepaid service purchased when I got the car and there seemed like no one was interested in helping him as he felt his questions were quickly brushed aside (add the fact that he had our 4 month baby at hand). We have both taken the vehicle to be serviced there several times through the years and it has never been like this. We would like to chalk this up to people having a bad day but it has never been like this as we've recieved excellent service in the past from a previous Advisor, Jim Duffer, and others. Would appreciate if the manager (NOT our assigned Service Advisor) of the Service Dept would reach out.</text>

<Review>Our family just purchased a car from Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek and was so impressed with the level of service in our buying experience!  Sam was our rep and he was wonderful.  From the minute that our family walked onto the lot, he was there to greet us.  What we loved the most about Sam was that he was so kind, so nice and so patient with us.  We didn't feel at any time that he gave us any pressure to purchase a car or a certain car.   Instead, he showed us the cars that we were interested in and explained the differences with each and made suggestions based on what we were looking for.  We didn't purchase a car on our first visit and he gave us know pressure about it, but we did make a secondary appointment to visit and possibly purchase our car.  On our second visit, Sam was as gracious as ever and patiently test drove cars with us and at the end of the visit, we were the proud owners of a new ML350.  The entire process was so smooth, seemless and so kind.  We never felt any pressure at any time and we are confident that we made the best decision at the end with Sam's help.  He also introduced us to our personal maintenance serviceman at the conclusion of the purchase and subsequently, met with us one more time to teach us the functions of the car.  We couldn't be more happy with our new car and most of all, we had such a great experience purchasing a car with Sam's help .  We highly recommend him and this dealership to anyone looking for or considering a new car!< /Review>< pictures>

Another Rip off.
I leased a MB back in 2016. My lease ends 3/10 and I just found out that all my paperwork related to DMV was processed on 3/8. No one told that this will cause problems when returning the car.

The problem: Lease end 3/10; car registration ends 3/8. How am I supposed to drive car for another 2 days? When speaking with Sales manager George about this problem; without having any shame he said pay the registration fee. So I pay fees for whole year just to drive car 2 more days. They fool customers when buying the car and then when returning it too. NEVER EVER GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. BEWARE!!< /Review>

I was evaluating Audi , BMW & Mercedes and my preference was in the same sequence. Athena Chow has done amazing job by providing so much information and the ease in organizing the test drive that I took decision to go in for Mercedes. My decision was totally based on the customer experience verses your competition as there was no much difference in the specifications. ALL THE BEST TO THE TEAM MERCEDES BENZ STEVENS CREEK.</text>

<Review>I am not satisfy at all.
Since i got my car i am not able to use it. all the times using jump start and not able to start its own.

I don't recall anything needs to e done related to battery but looks like something wrong happened during service/part replacement.

I seriously want to know what happen during service/part replacement, why car started giving issues in starting , suffering from past 3 days, who will compensate all the problems i have been through during this time.

I am not coming back to you for any service or any kind of work related to my car.<//Review><Name>Amit Agarwal< /Name>< date>

Jorainna is a great person who had helped us to find our interested car, she was very supportive. When we had any questions, she was very quick to answer both in text and phone calls. Finance Manager - Aaron is great, we had a good experience in this dealership.< /text>

<Review>My experience with their finance department unfortunately illustrates gross incompetence.  A simple extended warranty cancellation has now been going on since the end of August, resulted in 20 e-mails, various "it's been submitted" only to ask for similar information later, and a request to visit a different dealership because of "our computer system".  To date, I still don't have a refund, and I would never consider purchasing or servicing a vehicle here.  I've left a message for the General Manager, and next will contact Mercedes Benz corporate.  Truly a shame... (I would give zero stars, but as least - despite being incompetent -  the finance manager did return my messages.)< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Upon my initial completion of this review, I realized I did not give enough insight to my experience at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek. As a first time Mercedes buyer, Linh Mong and Marvin Siquig did an amazing job not only getting me the best deal possible but making the car buying experience as smooth and streamlined as possible. I recommend this dealership to anyone looking for an easy, welcoming, and honest car buying experience. I will definitely be coming back and I look forward to doing more business with Linh and Marvin in the future!<//review>

It is actually ONE Star for my most recent service.  To be fair, I have received 30+ Years of FIVE star service at ‘Smythe’ on Stevens Creek.  But this most recent experience compelled me to knock it down to FOUR stars.

My experience for what should have been an uneventful annual service was a tragic comedy of errors.

I dropped my car off for its annual inspection service last Wednesday and it was completed at the end of the day, Thursday.  They said just over on Friday for pick up, which I did.  My hubby dropped me off at 10am and left, and I went to pay the cashier and then waited for my car to be brought up.  I waited, and waited... and patiently waited.     I never knew I’d be waiting for so long and did not take note of the exact elapsed time.  I’d say that I waited half hour or more and no-once told me how much longer it will take.  And, mind you, this is for pick-up only!

The story is that this facility/dealership is servicing 100-150 cars per day and there are so many cars going in and out, that they are tight with parking. When they park a car, they turn the hazard lights on so that they have less chance of an accident.  Unfortunately, after they parked my car on Thursday, at the completion of the service, they did not turn off the hazard light.

So, when I went there on Friday for pick up, THEY CANNOT FIND MY CAR.  They use my key to find the exact parking location, but with the dead battery, they were unable to locate my vehicle.

They had to give me a rental car so that I can wait at home for the battery to re-charge , and return 4 hours later.<//text>

<review>I took my GLA 250 in for recall service.  Charles Fish, the service advisor, explained what needed to be done and how long it would take.  When the work was finished, he told me that my car was being washed and where to pick it up.  He was so personable and efficient!  I give him a 10+!

While I was waiting, I asked if someone could explain the GPS.  The fellow who helped me ( wish I could remember his name), was so patient and such a good teacher!  I'm thrilled that I can now use it!

It's not often that a person can say they had such a pleasant morning at a dealership!< /review>< resp>

< Review>
I worked with Martin at the Internet Sales department. He's very patient in finding out answers to all my questions and he tried to find the vehicle that I was looking for in a short time. Explained all the options/pricing/financial options to me. Delivery service, Brian, was also very friendly and knowledgable about the car. Brian at the finance department was awesome to work with too. He's very efficient, friendly and provided many cost saving options/promotions for a new owner like me. I had a great experience at the dealership.

The dealer's atmosphere is also bright and comfortable. I have not had any service experience yet; but I have a good feeling about it already.</Review>

I received an excellent sale service from Steven Creek Auto nation dealer especially the sales executive Bill Infald who took care of my car deal perfectly beyond my expectation. He made all efforts to make this deal possible without any hassles and answered all my questions/queries. Overall I am very satisfied with the extra ordinary service from Bill, Sales Manager ,Finance, etc. This is my first Mercedes and my family is enjoying this car so buying this car from Steven Creek dealer was really a right decision and if I need to buy next car then Mercedes will be on the top.<//Text>

<text>This was by far the easiest most pleasant car buying experience I have had. The entire staff was professional and friendly, we traveled 3 hours to purchase the car and they made us feel very welcome and made the process simple and quick. Our salesman Jared was wonderful & on top of everything, he even worked the details out via email before we made the 3 hour drive. I love the car & will definitely purchase from AutoNation in the future!</text>< pictures>

< review>
I visited on Memorial weekend. A passing sales guy told me they were very busy and that it would be better to make an appointment and come back later, like during the week. I couldn't believe my ears. They were telling a potential customer to piss off.

In the end, it took 40 minutes to get service. The first salesguy I had to walk up to because he was just standing around, picking his nose. I passed by two more like this. (Sorry guys, not a way to do business...when you see me wandering around casually, looking at your cars...GET A CLUE, WALK UP TO ME, AND ASK IF I NEED HELP.)

We talked for a few minutes and he said he needed to run back inside to get me an updated price list. After waiting for him to return for 10 minutes, I realized he had ditched me.

Livid, I walked back into the dealership and asked for someone else, after the receptionist asked if I was being helped. I spoke to her when I first arrived. She said they were quite busy and offered to put my name down on the waiting list to talk to someone, but that it would take 40 minutes. That's when I started wandering around and seeing sales guys standing around picking their noses.

I eventually asked for a particular salesman on the recommendation of a friend. He really took the time to sit down, explain to me the different models, and took me on several test drives. While I finally got the help I needed, this should have never happened.

If you're busy, it's your fault. You have historical data and should have staffed up. I don't know if I'll buy a car from them after the way I was treated. While there was one good seed, I have to wonder about the rest of the staff.

Update (6/13/2018)
I'm beginning to think the response from Mercedes is a formality and that they have no intentions on following through and providing the good service they promised.

I called and left a message with the General Manager on Monday afternoon. Never heard back. Tried again in Wednesday, just to be told the manager is in meetings all day long and I should leave a message in his voicemail.

What for?  So you guys can continue to ignore me, just as you did when I first walked into your dealership? You guys just don't get it...< /review>

The parking lot seems disorganized on the service department site. The actual entrance just closed by the metal gate. People taking the widely open exit gate as the entrance, due to the lot is full of/crowded with new cars, visitors/customers, delivery & contractors.< /text>

<text>The absolute best car buying experience I have had to date. From my initial inquiry online and over the phone Kevin Hua was extremely helpful!! I made an appointment and was welcomed in and made to feel very comfortable by Sofie and staff. Met with Eddie and he provided answers to all of my questions and there were MANY as the Mercedes brand is new to me. I was sure I was going to make them crazy before I received answers to all my question, but No! Always a smile in their voice and on their face! Nik in Finance was extremely helpful and kind, again, no hard sell! The entire staff that I came into contact with were amazing! I will be back! Thanks Everyone! You Rock!

Mark Arnold offered an outstanding buying experience. He was knowledgeable wrt the product, the process and the financial options available to me.
Having been in the technology industry previously, he related well and was respectful of my time. No games, no ego, just plain old-fashioned customer service.
Great experience overall!< /text>

<review>Always a great experience going in for service at Mercedes Stevens Creek. Danny Ho has taken care of us from the start and he is awesome. The process is always efficient, from check in to rolling out the door in a loaner car. Service might cost a few extra bucks at the dealer, but it's so convenient and you know your car is being fixed/serviced the right way.<//review><Rating>5</Rating>< user_id>

I bought a 2013 C-250 through Smythe and I couldn't be happier.  They took very good care of me and made the transaction seamless and smooth.  If ever I had a question or a concern, it was promptly answered and/or resolved.  The salesman and sales manager that I spoke with were both very personable and helpful.  I've recently moved, and if I were ever back in town, I'd pay them a visit... that's how good the service was.

Thanks guys!<//text>

<Review>Let me start by saying people here are really nice when you get them on the phone and the car was what I expected. However, I purchased my car from here as an out of state buyer.

Their process if you buy the car even if you live in a different state, you have to pay California taxes or you have to get it shipped, even though the law clearly states that you can show a tax or utility bill that you live somewhere else so you don't have to pay taxes. therefore I decided to get the car ship based on their process as it was cheaper than paying taxes.

For the time I agreed to purchase the car, it took three weeks just to get the paperwork to me, during that time I had to keep following up to understand what the issue was and nobody seems to know and I keep get an answer "you should have it tomorrow". Sure enough, it was never sent out by their Finance team, it's not until I talked to their General Manager (Stan) I was able to get the paperwork and car within a week, as the their Finance team never sent the paperwork to the notary service.

Finally, I'm super excited I receive the car (4 weeks from the time I agreed to by) , however they failed to send any paperwork with the car, therefore now I have a car that was parked in my driveway and I can't drive it. I was able to get a 15 day temporary pass after I follow up multiple times to get the paper sent to me. They sent me everything except the title, as they wanted to send it directly to the licensing office near my house

Now, over 100 of text message, follow up, calls with so many different folks, I still don't have the title to register the car and I won't be able to drive to work as I get rid of my old car. Till today they haven't sent it to the licensing office.

Additionally,  when I bought the car I was promised a second key, that they will order and send to me, every time I follow up I don't get a clear answer if they even ordered it as the service manager is out, local dealership didn't want, etc.," I even got an offer to order it myself and they will reimburse me, but known their track record, I would likely have to spend hours following via text and calls to actually ever get that check.

I'm tired of driving all the follow ups, all various excuses, and lack of delivery on their part. I just need them to deliver on the title and second key without me having to call, text and talk to so many people even their back office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did talk to the GM and had someone from the office (Rashel) who helped me and kept me informed and delivered the key and title, she was great. But again prior to that it was a really long process where I felt like I worked from the dealership to get things moving.<//Review><pics>None</pics><time>1521565904197<//time>< UserId.>

<review>I was totally impressed with the quality of service, the knowledge, the graciousness and the car!  Danesh is the best... ask for him if you can.  He follows through and has the strangest ability to grant your wishes.  I used to hate going into dealerships... but this was a total switch for me.  This included the comfort of the environment from the waiting area to the service area to the display of cars.  Information was readily shared.  And Kim made the financial arrangements a breeze.

Outstanding service. The Rep I worked with, Shawn, was very responsive to any questions that came up and really went the extra mile for us to get a fair price and financing locked down. 10/10 would be happy to recommend or purchase from them again.</Review>

I had the most amazing experience with these guys while buying my first car in the United States. Eddie was very helpful and walked me through exactly why the cars are priced the way they are and maintain complete transparency. He even let me compare the prices with brand new cars and see if that was a feasible option. All in all excellent service and I'd really suggest you ask for Eddie.<//text>

I recently bought my Mercedes-Benz 2016 C300 at the end of my 4-year lease.  I was more than satisfied with the process of completing my purchase.  John McCarthy, my sales associate, and the managers I dealt with made the transaction efficient, straightforward, and courteous throughout.  I highly recommend the dealership for the quality of its service, which is exceptional based my experience of  buying, leasing and maintaining my cars over the years.</Text>

We have recently bought a C-300 brand new Benz from Stevens creek, CA dealer. We met Diana Than, the sales rep with great knowledge about the car. She helped us thru each step of the process clearly and made our job very smooth. She also ensured she beat the competitor price for the same car. Overall it's amazing experience working with her and the management of Stevens creek show room. I would highly recommend Stevens creek for people who are willing to buy/lease the Benz car.</text>

Was a little difficult to book my appointment initially - the girl who booked my appointment was terrible at responding to calls / answering her phone even when she provided her personal phone number. However, once my appointment was set, my assigned adviser Jake Tran was very accommodating and friendly! He helped set us up with a rental car to let us run our errands around San Jose for the day and the car was ready on time. Will definitely continue to get my Mercedes serviced here. Thanks Jake, for the great experience!</Text>

My experience was good. Diana helped us with what we needed and got me a decent deal for my car. Though the cat had scratches on the driver side door, driver side back seat door, bumper, back of the passenger seat, and very dirty interior ceiling, Diana promised that she would have all of this taken care of with a following visit.

I will update and revise if needed depending on the promises made and the result of this. But for now, it has been a good experience.</text>

Another Rip off.
I leased a MB back in 2016. My lease ends 3/10 and I just found out that all my paperwork related to DMV was processed on 3/8. No one told that this will cause problems when returning the car.

The problem: Lease end 3/10; car registration ends 3/8. How am I supposed to drive car for another 2 days? When speaking with Sales manager George about this problem; without having any shame he said pay the registration fee. So I pay fees for whole year just to drive car 2 more days. They fool customers when buying the car and then when returning it too. NEVER EVER GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. BEWARE!!</Review>

Strongly recommend! Jorainna gave us the best customer services ever than any of the dealers. Very nice and helpful. We got a amazing deal for our new Mercedes c class, love in it. There inventory is also more sufficient than other dealers, get whatever additional features you want with extremely low price.<//Review>

Fine... Nice facility.  A little concerning that they somehow cannot provide you with a receipt for a cash payment.  Sketchy.  It's real simple. Grab a receipt book.<//Text>

Recently just purchased a car here! The person that helped me out was Bryan Tu! It was an amazing experience! Was walking around the lot for a while nobody helped me out at first maybe because I had flip flops on and looked like I couldn't afford a car here. Bryan came out and he went the extra mile to help me out! He had so much knowledge about the cars it was truly amazing! Went to every dealership out there! Second to none Bryan can give u the specs on any car there, but he has knowledge of his competitors too! And u will never feel pushed to buy anything! My experience with car salesman have been brutally! Bmw across the F-them I can purchase any car on that lot! If u come here ask for Bryan Tu! The man knows his cars! When u are making a purchase of this degree u want the person selling u the car to have knowledge about what he or she is doing!<//review>

Holding a foreign driving licence I was trying to buy my first car in the US. I had walked into many showrooms but as soon as I entered the benz showroom at Stevens Creek - the atmosphere and the customer support was so smooth that you felt that if there's a car you should own this is it. I was then mapped to one of the best Salesman I've come across - Manny, who made it such an amazing experience! Thank you Manny and thank you team.</Review>

I CALLED TO SEE IF MY BATTERY ON MY 2015 SPRINTER MOTOR HOME WAS UNDER WARRANTY , THE EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE SERVICE PERSON GAVE ME CUSTOMER CARES NUMBER SO THAT I COULD EITHER TOW IT OR HAVE A TECH COME OUT . MERCEDES ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE WAS OUT TO MY LOCATION IN 40 MINUTES.  THE SERVICE COULD NOT BE BETTER.  THEY BROUGHT A NEW BATTERY AND IT WAS RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY.  THANK YOU !!!!!!!</review>

I contacted them on Friday and by 2:00 pm Saturday I was in the car of my dreams.  I had tried another Mercedes dealership and after 3 months they kept telling me the car was coming but it never arrived.  Great customer service from Stevens Creek.< /Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Ive held off on writing this review until i bought a mercedes from ANOTHER dealer. I came in early last week with cash and all necessities to drive off the lot in a G class. Upon showing up i was directed to edwin the "service" manager. After waiting nearly 30 minutes for him to converse and laugh with his co workers i was greeted with a "what do you want?" After that laughable ice breaker i tried to explain to him what i was looking for and he proceeded to text and constantly check his phone acting like he was listening. Once i was done explaining what i had and what i was looking for. He says "sorry i wasnt listening, could you repeat that?"" At this point i said no and continued to look around the lot. After 20 minutes i decided to try again and was deliberately avoided by edwin as he sat and stared at his phone when i asked him for help again. He said "i didnt look like i needed help" after this i left completely enraged and feeling profiled because of the color of my skin and went to beschoff mercedes on capitol. Im a proffesional athlete with many friends that are going to want the car I just bought, i will be directing them to Beschoff. You should teach Edwin to treat everyone with the same respect. his pockets and the companys pockets could have been a little fatter after dealing with my team and I. I really hope someone addresses this i should have gotten it on camera and went to the news.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Their market strategy is absolutely no class. I got a coupon of free check up and wash for my c class Mercedes. From the coupon link I made the appointment. When the date approaches, I got a call from an agent telling me that she’s gonna cancel my appointment since the bottom line for the appointment is for a specific  service, while the tire check I want is not included. She then mentioned I need to come to dealership directly and  wait 1.5 hrs for my checkup service. That is ridiculous, my own a Mercedes will wait 1.5 hrs just for a check up?</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The first time we walked into the dealership, we met Omar Awwad. He was so low key and knowledgeable we knew he was the man we wanted to deal with. We enjoyed seeing all of the beautiful cars in the newly remodeled facility. We made several trips to the facility and always received a friendly reception and especially good service from Omar. We are just thrilled with our 2015 E class diesel. Thank you.< /review>

From the moment I walked in the door until the time, I left the dealership with my New C250 Coupe Mercedes-Benz. The entire team was attentive, respectful, and thoughtful. It was a very pleasant experience. My representative Charlie Shen is personable and kind and he really looked out for me. I feel so proud to drive my new car. The Finance Manager is a hoot and a holler... really fun.<//text>

I've been a customer of the MB of Stevens Creek for over 6 years now and I must say that this was probably the worst experience I've had so far. Still giving it two stars because the staff is very friendly and pleasure to deal with. Shuttle service is timely and high quality.  My complain though is about the complimentary car wash I received along with the courtesy appointment after 3 months from buying the car (a very nice touch!). When my car was delivered it had wet spots on passenger seat that valet had to wipe off before giving me the key. That would have been okay but once I left the dealership I noticed that my wood and leather steering wheel is covered with something resembling either dried dirt or soap. I had to pull over and try to clean the wheel with drinking water (I had no time to come back to the dealer). Then I noticed oily/soapy fingerprints on central console buttons. Also, the quality of the actual wash was not good - there were dirt droplet marks on the rear bumper and next to rear view mirrors. The car looked more like it came out of rain rather than from a car wash.
I really like this dealer and my experience had been perfect all these years. It is a pity that a thing as simple as a car wash can make it this unpleasant. I am sure that this was a one off (probably a car wash guy was really ready for the Friday and didn't care about cars much). I just want to make them aware of my experience to fix it for other customers and myself in the future.< /text>

My experience was good. Diana helped us with what we needed and got me a decent deal for my car. Though the cat had scratches on the driver side door, driver side back seat door, bumper, back of the passenger seat, and very dirty interior ceiling, Diana promised that she would have all of this taken care of with a following visit.

I will update and revise if needed depending on the promises made and the result of this. But for now, it has been a good experience.<//Text>

I've been taken my E500 to Stevens creek mercedes for services and repairs since 2007. Troy always takes good car of me and the car.  He listens and takes his time to explain any issue with the car. He always returns my calls even when I simply asked for advice on the car. I can tell you that other service rep in other dealers don't return calls unless there's money or repair involved. Troy defines the service department in Stevens Creek Mercedes.< /Text>

The overall service is pretty good. I bought a used car few weeks ago. And I found a big scratch on my car one day after I bought my car. And Stan helped fixed it. I would recommend my friends and families to buy car from this place.

Stan in sales department and Susan in service department are very nice and professional.</Review>

Service is often an overlooked item, but it is realistically the most amount of time you will spend at the dealership.  Charlie Fish has assisted me with all my service needs and I could not be happier.  Every ask I have is cared for, updates timely, and explanations are thorough.  My entire experience from the time I drop off my car, until the time I drive away is top-notch every time.  MB of Stevens Creek is the best.<//text>

I visited their service center couple of weeks back for factory recall. On-site service was good and I was helped well in person. I was also reminded about my first maintenance service due and was informed about the charges at the time. A day after, I had e-mailed few questions on Oct 9 regarding the maintenance service for which I am still awaiting replies. Since I was informed that I will have to bear the maintenance expenses if I delay service by more than a month, I am concerned any delayed response would be costly< /Text>

Road Side assistance was outstanding! I had a flat tire at 11:30 pm
I called and they had someone to assist me within a reasonable time.
The technician was very professional, not creepy like other services. He changed the tire and I was on my way in no time!< /text>

<review>Too much attitude. Terrible parking. They remodeled the place, but didn't make it any easier to get dead cars in and out of. Over priced, moderate quality cars.</review>< Pictures>

Alex Truong from service and repairs demonstrated excellent customer service and went above and beyond in making sure I was taken care of. He updated me on everything that was going on with my vehicle & continued to provide excellent service while doing it. I highly recommend him to anyone in need of repairs at Stevens creek.<//text>

I bought my car on the same day I went to checkout their 2018 models. There was no pressure and the folks I dealt with were very professional. I want to call out Jared and Stan for all their assistance. Great guys to work with and help solve some minor problem I had with my SUV the next day. Happy to recommend them for anyone who is looking to buy a new Mercedes.</Review>

To be honest with this dealership. They should just stick to selling Mercedes and not used cars. I traded in my car to them for $1500 and I seen them trying to sell it for $6000 . Only an idiot would buy it for that price . And I bought it for $3900 when I got it from another dealership. And also when you buy a used car from them they just want to sell it to you and then they tell you what the car has and doesn't have .. and before I agree to buy a car from them I asked for 2 pair of keys and they said yes they'll have it . But then after signing the papers they said one doesn't work.. don't buy used cars but for new I don't know ...</text>

Amazing experience buying a new Mercedes at Smythe. Customer service was superb with everyone I interfaced with. Buying a car can be extremely stressful. However, I did not feel pressure. I felt support and that they wanted to have a happy customer! I was definitely happy when I left! Thank you!< /text>

I recently purchased a 2015 M-Class 350 from Mercedes-Benz Stevens Creek, a five star experience.  Prior to retirement I worked for a company committed to world-class customer service, a culture not easily developed or maintained.  I know it when I see it and Stevens Creek MB has it.  Best car buying experience I have ever had.  I am a fan and would readily drive the 150 miles again to purchase a car from Mercedes-Benz Stevens Creek.<//Text>

A pleasure shopping experience with Smythe European!  Tony Wood is a great director. He explained all the details and spent a great amount of time with me to choose the car. Give a reasonable quote price at first time, so I save a lot of time to shop around. He is very friendly and knowledgeable, I am glad I make a right decision to buy from him.  I will definitely refer him to my friends who want to buy a Mercedes.

Smythe's service team is also very professional; it was highly recommended by most of my friends.</Review>

With a noteworthy affable demeanor Nate greeted and interviewed us for his initial assessment of the potential causes for the Check Engine Light (CEL). In just one day his team performed a thorough examination, determined the trouble and resolved it. Moreover, the repair to this particular element of the emission system was covered by an extended warranty that Mercedes established in recognition of persistent issues involving this part of the system.

The store experience was really good. No issues there. But have an issue with Mercedes in general. I leased my car like 10 months back, there's hardly 6K miles on the car. But suddenly the air started to leak from one of the tires. Later found out that there was no puncture but a small crack in the rim. So i had to replace the RIM which costed me around 1.2K$'s. I have never seen this kind of issue in the past. Me and my parents owned a honda for more than 15 years now and it has more than 150K miles. We never saw any issue with the tire rim. The only reason I am posting this is because the dealer told me that rims usually crack or break if you go through a pot hole or something. No sir they don't i have not seen such kind of issue in the past that too on a brand new car within a year. The quality of the mercedes parts has depreceated a lot it seems then... nothing else.</Text>

We just recently leased an electric B class vehicle. The sales experience we had at Stevens Creek was outstanding. They went the extra mile of even dropping of the car at my house in person and walking us through the details of the car. The Car is impressive, too and lives up the the range it quotes.<//review>

A day completely wasted. Never experienced a worse service before. I went there to buy a E300 today,  and we had a few preferred colors and configurations in mind. After spending more than 2 hours in the showroom, they showed me a car that somewhat matched my preferences,  I test drove that. The salesman showed me another car that we liked, and he promised me that the car was available for pickup the same day. Because of another engagement, I had to leave at lunch time, and we had another appointment in the evening to finalize the deal. The salesman even sent me an email with the detailed configuration of the car we liked. When I went there in the evening (I took a Lyft because I wanted to drive back the new car home), the salesman told me that the car was sold to some employee already and he didn't know. What a shame. It is perhaps true that the salesman didn't know, but either he didn't do his homework right, or the system is so inefficient that he couldn't find out. Overall, I wasted my whole Saturday on this and I would think twice before dealing with this dealership again and would certainly not recommend this to others.</text>

Waiting for more than 40 min after being checked in for my scheduled appointment. The service adviser made up an excuse that he was checking to make sure that they had the part. Well, they know what part will be needed when I book the appointment. Why this inventory check was not done days earlier?! That is just unacceptable. And then another VERY long wait time for the curtsy shuttle. Another customer before me waited for over an hour for the shuttle. My next car will probably not be a Mercedes! Definitely won't be from this poorly managed place!</text>

We had a pleasant experience at the dealership, this is one of the best buying experience I had with car dealership! No pushing sales tactic and willing to work with the customers for a fair and square deal. Although the 1st experience with a different sales associate didn’t work out so great but after Huck (GM) stepped in and assign Samir & Martin to me, everything went to a smooth sail.</Text>

< Review>
We serviced our Audi and Mercedes almost in the same week at the respective dealerships. I must say the experience at Audi was MUCH better and smoother. Mercedes did not seem to have loaner cars, did not accommodate or even try to look for a loaner, they seem to want to charge for every little thing, and overall for the amount we are paying, the customer service is sub-par. Our service manager was great and tried to smooth things over, and i can't speak to the service itself as I am not a car expert, but even 3 stars seems being a bit generous.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Bunch of crooks. Honestly if I had an option to never service my car again or to take for free car service at this dealership, I would never service my car.
I had to take my car in to replace recalled Takata airbags. Got the car back, drove home and next day it  wont start. Very obvious that during service some thing happened thats causing car to not start. It could be a genuine mistake but instead of trying to help, tell me that battery is bad and ask me to tow the car to shop, pay for tow and then repair because as per the expert, replacing airbags doesnt have to do anything with battery.

I ended up calling AAA who looked and said that the battery terminal was left loose as they are REQUIRED to disconnect battery and drain any charge before replacing airbags.

These guys a such bigs crooks.

Despite an impacted calendar Sprinter specialist Nate Jones accommodated our pressing service need--we were only passing through the area without  ample time--and promptly advanced our Sprinter into his schedule within days of our first contact. With a noteworthy affable demeanor Nate greeted and interviewed us for his initial assessment of the potential causes for the Check Engine Light (CEL). In just one day his team performed a thorough examination, determined the trouble and resolved it. Moreover, the repair to this particular element of the emission system was covered by an extended warranty that Mercedes established in recognition of persistent issues involving this part of the system. Thanks to Nate and his team for friendly, exceptional customer service and Mercedes for addressing the problem and honoring their warranty.<//Review>

<Review>My last experience at Stevens creek Mercedes was not a happy one.
1) I chose shuttle service when I made my online appointment. When I dropped my car off, I was told that there is no shuttle service on Saturdays. Why was I able to select shuttle service when I made the appointment?
2) I was told that they would call me early in the afternoon to let me know when my car would be ready. I did not get a call until 4pm
3) When I called to check the status, I was put on hold for 35 mins and after that long wait, I was asked to leave a message. Really?
That was bad customer service.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Was a little difficult to book my appointment initially - the girl who booked my appointment was terrible at responding to calls / answering her phone even when she provided her personal phone number. However, once my appointment was set, my assigned adviser Jake Tran was very accommodating and friendly! He helped set us up with a rental car to let us run our errands around San Jose for the day and the car was ready on time. Will definitely continue to get my Mercedes serviced here. Thanks Jake, for the great experience!<//review>< Pics>

My experience with Mercedes-Benz Stevens Creek has been wonderful.  I always bring my car there for service.  Ask for Susan Sulimani to be your service adviser.  She is very responsive to the customer, and provides a thorough review of the repairs and maintenance.  There was an instance I needed an emergency repair on my car, and she was able to have service look at it immediately.  I give her a 5 star rating for customer service.< /Review>

Goran, our sales consultant is amazing. We are on our second car from MB SC and it is all due to the tremendous customer service in sales and also in service. Charlie Fish is our service consultant and a true professional. These folks know how to treat their customers for the long term. Other than being incredibly busy, whether you are in service or sales, the experience is worth the wait.< /text>

Very good experience. I was having some intermittent issues with a parking-lamp indicator, which wasn't easily traceable. Rather than going back and forth, they replaced my headlight completely as it was under warranty.

In addition, the loaner (had to reserve in advance) was very cool.

Great customer service, and +1 for overall experience.< /text>

<Review>Frankly the sales team is the worst I've ever dealt with.  I've never had to work so hard to pry such basic information from them.  I even had to badger them to get the car ready so I could purchase it.  Most dealers would be happy to have interest in a car on their lot, but they were way to passive, to the point of coming across as "I don't care if I sell a car".  It took me a month to get my "Due list" completed, and I had to call the service department to make an appointment to get the part installed.  (Apparently they don't communicate among themselves very well either)  Once I started dealing with the service department directly, the man I talked to was extremely professional and called me when he said he would.  I had asked for a loaner car when I made the appointment, but was told they weren't available for weeks, but the service agent offered a rental car for free since the repair was taking longer than expected.  Again, the person making the appointment didn't seem to know I could get a rental car at no cost, so I had to drive an hour and a half down there, then have a friend pick me up and drive me home.  The worst car purchase experience in my life, and I've owned a lot of cars!!  No apologies were offered from the dealership management, nothing!  I doubt they are even aware how some of their customers are treated... as long as they make sales, they probably really don't care.  Don't waste you time with this place.

To Owner Of Business... I know you do your normal "canned" reply, but I'm tired of making calls and sending emails to you and your people!  Why don't you reach out to me for once?  My efforts in communicating with your business are exhausted, so time for you to put in some effort.  The effort that was lacking from the beginning.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Ive held off on writing this review until i bought a mercedes from ANOTHER dealer. I came in early last week with cash and all necessities to drive off the lot in a G class. Upon showing up i was directed to edwin the "service" manager. After waiting nearly 30 minutes for him to converse and laugh with his co workers i was greeted with a "what do you want?" After that laughable ice breaker i tried to explain to him what i was looking for and he proceeded to text and constantly check his phone acting like he was listening. Once i was done explaining what i had and what i was looking for. He says "sorry i wasnt listening, could you repeat that?"" At this point i said no and continued to look around the lot. After 20 minutes i decided to try again and was deliberately avoided by edwin as he sat and stared at his phone when i asked him for help again. He said "i didnt look like i needed help" after this i left completely enraged and feeling profiled because of the color of my skin and went to beschoff mercedes on capitol. Im a proffesional athlete with many friends that are going to want the car I just bought, i will be directing them to Beschoff. You should teach Edwin to treat everyone with the same respect. his pockets and the companys pockets could have been a little fatter after dealing with my team and I. I really hope someone addresses this i should have gotten it on camera and went to the news.<//Review>

<review>Bunch of crooks. Honestly if I had an option to never service my car again or to take for free car service at this dealership, I would never service my car.
I had to take my car in to replace recalled Takata airbags. Got the car back, drove home and next day it  wont start. Very obvious that during service some thing happened thats causing car to not start. It could be a genuine mistake but instead of trying to help, tell me that battery is bad and ask me to tow the car to shop, pay for tow and then repair because as per the expert, replacing airbags doesnt have to do anything with battery.

I ended up calling AAA who looked and said that the battery terminal was left loose as they are REQUIRED to disconnect battery and drain any charge before replacing airbags.

These guys a such bigs crooks. Avoid this dealership at all cost or you may end up paying more.<//review>< gmap_id>

DO NOT RECOMMEND - LOUSY and SLOPPY SERVICE

I brought my vehicle here for an oil change/check-up and the technician/servicer did not tighten the top engine gasket...which resulted in engine oil sprouting out of the engine over some time before I noticed. By the time I noticed, the engine oil has covered the entire engine compartment and now I have to go find some auto-detailing shop to steam-clean the entire engine bay.

How can ANY technician not tighten something as important as the engine oil cover...makes me nervous just thinking about what else they may have missed or glossed over. If you value your car or want to avoid costly repairs/clean-ups in the future, take your service needs elsewhere.</text>

<Review>We came in and were  greeted by sales person Ellen Lans, she was so kind, she got my husband the car that he wanted!
Ellen went above and beyond what I expected regarding customer service. She followed up with us and kept us updated as when to expect the car.
My husband loves his car, this is his first Mercedes, I am sure it will not be his last.
We had a great stress free deal.

Thank you Ellen<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I went in last week for the first time after going to another dealership for years. Had a great experience. My service adviser Charlie is fantastic and
my husband and I are so glad we are back.
They treat you just the way you would hope a luxury dealership should.
Very happy and will return for all service.</text>

I lease one 2019 GLC SUV at June 2019 recently from dealer Asad Hanif.
We had a very nice and gentle conversion about the price and he gave me a very good deal.
After I leasing the car, I had asked him few questions regarding the new car. He provided a very nice and detailed explanations.
I am very happy to have this business deal with Asad : )< /review>

<text>We just bought a new GLA 250 recently. The sales is really nice. However, only a 3-star because it has been more than a month and we still haven't got the second key. After getting our car for more than three weeks, we went there again, just to find out the second key is still not ready. Eventually after a month we were told we have to come again to program the key, but we called several times and no one replies. It is not our fault that the second key is not working, but they make it such a difficult process. We are still waiting and feeling disappointed.</text>< pictures>

I walked into Stevens Creek Mercedes Benz, knowing what I already wanted.  I was pressed for time and expressed my wants and needs to the receptionist in the front desk.  Diana Than came and helped me with finding the exact vehicle I was looking for.  She exceeded every expectation I had with prompt, professional, and thorough service.  The whole experience was very pleasant.  After finishing my purchase, I was surprised to be ahead of schedule.  Thank you Diana Than.<//Review>

<review>The first time we walked into the dealership, we met Omar Awwad. He was so low key and knowledgeable we knew he was the man we wanted to deal with. We enjoyed seeing all of the beautiful cars in the newly remodeled facility. We made several trips to the facility and always received a friendly reception and especially good service from Omar. We are just thrilled with our 2015 E class diesel. Thank you.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Found a rare 4 x 4 Sprinter Van in Blue Gray at Steven Creek Mercedes-Benz dealer.  The van was just the way I wanted it, with some packages and options but not over loaded to drive the cost way up.  The Sprinter consultant, Shawn, was excellent.  Overall an excellent buying experience.  And love the van!</Text>< rate>

Learning that MBZ now only offers a free one-way shuttle when I dropped my car off for a recall notice to replace the air bags gets 1 star. The amount of time I waited to get the shuttle also gets 1 star. I ultimately gave up and sat in the dealership the entire time of service and never used the shuttle. I could only think of the high quality MBZ dealership my brother goes to in Portland Oregon, where they was his car weekly for free, even if he is not having service, plus provide other benefits. Impossible for me to give this dealership a high star rating though my service manager Danny Ho does deserve 5 stars.</Review>< pics>

All the usual scummy car dealer tactics plus more.

The salesmen inside told me they could NOT custom order a car for me, and that I'd have to buy one on the lot, and basically told me the price was non-negotiable. I talked to a few other Mercedes dealers and they all said they could custom order one for me no problem, and that price was negotiable before and after delivery.

They did the whole "let me waste 30 minutes of your time while I'm getting 'paperwork'" shtick as well.

Honestly this dealership feels very dishonest. I'd be worried that all their employees will treat you like garbage once you're done buying your car and are looking for someone to maintain and support it.

Edited because the internet manager portion was Porsche Stevens Creek. Got them mixed up because both felt very dishonest and gave me a similar experience within the same day.</Text>

I have been taking my Mercedes(s) to Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek for decades and
I am always treated with curtousey and respect, but most of all, my automobiles receive
the finest maintenance.  As a woman, this is extremely important that a feeling of trust
has been established and I wouldn't take my cars anywhere else.  My new Service Rep,
Don Battles, follows a long line of trusted gentlemen.< /Text>

<review>I've sourced two brand new vehicles from this dealership in the last 1.5 years largely due to Tony Spencer. I've known Tony for several years but lost contact with him. Through circuituitous events, we circled  back and he is just a wonderful person to work with. He is an expert in his field, humble, classy, patient, hardworking,.. truly a rare asset in this industry. I'm so glad I reconnected with him.< /review></record>

I wanted to tell you, my whole experience from start to finish was professional and enjoyable. You went out of your way to find the exact Mercedes I wanted. The car exceeded my expectations. I thoroughly enjoyed working with you and will recommend you & MBSC to anyone looking for an excellent automobile. In a world where we don't always have the best experience in a car dealership (Audi), this was great. It is without hesitation that I would buy another car from Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I recently purchased a 2015 M-Class 350 from Mercedes-Benz Stevens Creek, a five star experience.  Prior to retirement I worked for a company committed to world-class customer service, a culture not easily developed or maintained.  I know it when I see it and Stevens Creek MB has it.  Best car buying experience I have ever had.  I am a fan and would readily drive the 150 miles again to purchase a car from Mercedes-Benz Stevens Creek.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798< /Gmap_id></record>

The team at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek is why I have 315,000 miles on my 2005 ML350, but even I have to admit there are limits to mechanical devices. Yesterday Charlie Fish and his colleagues recommended equally talented folks in the finance/sales division, and now I have a new ML 350.
All good.</Review>

A pleasure shopping experience with Smythe European!  Tony Wood is a great director. He explained all the details and spent a great amount of time with me to choose the car. Give a reasonable quote price at first time, so I save a lot of time to shop around. He is very friendly and knowledgeable, I am glad I make a right decision to buy from him.  I will definitely refer him to my friends who want to buy a Mercedes.

Smythe's service team is also very professional; it was highly recommended by most of my friends.</Review>

<review>Danny Ho gets 5 stars.
Learning that MBZ now only offers a free one-way shuttle when I dropped my car off for a recall notice to replace the air bags gets 1 star. The amount of time I waited to get the shuttle also gets 1 star. I ultimately gave up and sat in the dealership the entire time of service and never used the shuttle. I could only think of the high quality MBZ dealership my brother goes to in Portland Oregon, where they was his car weekly for free, even if he is not having service, plus provide other benefits. Impossible for me to give this dealership a high star rating though my service manager Danny Ho does deserve 5 stars.<//review>< gmapID>

I lease one 2019 GLC SUV at June 2019 recently from dealer Asad Hanif.
We had a very nice and gentle conversion about the price and he gave me a very good deal.
After I leasing the car, I had asked him few questions regarding the new car. He provided a very nice and detailed explanations.
I am very happy to have this business deal with Asad : )<//Review>

<Text>It was excellent service.
They gave me a ride to my work and picked me up from my work when a car was ready to pick up.
Of course the problems was fixed in short time and more than that they had touched up service for some spots that showed scratches.
I was very satisfied with their service. Specially Jake who served me the day  was very nice and professional.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I purchased a new Mercedes Benz C Class car from Smythe European. The process was seamless despite the fact that I delayed the decision to purchase overnight. Not only was the hand-off between salesman well done but in fact the transition between sales, finance and service was so well orchestrated that I would have to rate my experience the best I have ever received, anywhere. Professional and no hassles lead me to highly recommend the team at Smythe.<//Text>< response>

<Review>In my opinion, car shopping and buying has a bit of drudgery to it.  The team (Ellen, Nick, et al) at Mercedes Benz Stevens Creek made the process easy.   Their attentiveness and honesty (read, not a bunch of car sales person b.s.) is what stood out for me.  Haven't experienced the service side yet, but I'm expecting a similar review.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp><rate>5< /rate>< username>

The price is good.

drove two and a half hours from Sacramento to come see this car 2006 s65 AMG which in the pictures that were they took pictures it looks excellent they didnt take any pictures of any of the damage and made everything look good did not even indicate that there's any damage to the car drove all the way out here to notice that the front bumpers completely thrash broke in a few different places scratched the side of the car just went through a recent accident with two door scratched up the rear trunk has been damaged and the rims are scratched

The use car manager came out and joked about the car being old and said what do you want it old ... He said he will repaint the doors and bumper and went I mention the broken sections of the bumper all he can say is its a old car..

The headlights both where loose I showed the sales guy and tighten it I front of him..

If the manager doesn't give a s*** and tells me that he's also going to lower the mileage on the car for me by driving it in reverse 🙄🙄🙄< /text>

<text>Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek,
I bought a used Honda with odometer of about 90k.
But I should saw three warning signals of engine, VSA, and exclamation mark in three days. Then, the car started to shake forward and backward during driving.
I know an used car cannot be perfect, but I think a dealer shop must at least let me avoid initial serious problems.
The only one thing good of the AutoNation in my experience is that they repaid all my money back, because I could meet the serious problem within 5 days of repayment warranty.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I have never had a better experience nor have I received such attention and care as I did from Assistant Service Manager, Susan Sulimani, at the MB dealership on Stevens Creek!  I am still amazed at how much my 2001 SLK 320 was transformed from a complete mess into a very respectable machine.  The other Sunnyvale German Auto 'shop' I visited had no idea what was wrong and played around for months, then just left my car to rot in the sun when they closed down.  Never listen to anyone who says not to go to the dealership at Stevens Creek because it is 'too expensive'...NO - it was very reasonable and amazing how the car actually came to life again.  First class all the way from everyone I encountered, especially those who went the extra mile to make sure I had my car on time.  Go for it!</text>

<review>I did my 70K-mile car service in Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek, which included a transmission service in Dec 2018. I started to notice some minor transmission issue 2 month later, but I was too busy around that time and had a long vacation abroad afterwards, so I didn't get a chance to send my car for a diagnosis and repairment at that moment. After my vacation, while the first day I was driving, the car was broken on the freeway. Since I am an AAA member, so I asked AAA to tow my car to their car service center. They checked my car, and noticed there were couple missing codes shown in car's system. Under my permission, AAA teardowned my transmission, and detected the fluid in the transmission was low and couple parts including the gears were burnt. I spent couple thousands dollars for the repairment and the rentals. After the repairment, I brought AAA's report back to Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek. Over one week back and forth calls,  I finally met their manager. He asked me for the evidences, including: how much was the fluid in the transmission when broken? what was the methods the AAA's engineer measured it, and was that following the Mercedes engineer's working flow? and asked to bring the broken parts to him. Unfortunately, I don't have any, since AAA's engineer was using different way for checking and repairment as Mercedes' engineer does. I believe the broken car itself was the best evidence. I mentioned that they could reopen my transmission for investigation. They said I would have to pay the money for the checking, and the results might not help with anything neither, since it was repaired and no evidence anymore. I called Mercedes manufactory for help, and got feedbacks that this kind of issues they can not help, have to talk with the dealership level, which means the manager again. I already spent much time for the initial car service, car broken, car checking,  repairment, bringing back to Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek, talking with the Mercedes' specialists,and then the manager, asking AAA's help with the "evidences", and more, and finally got nothing. So I might leave it up, don't want to waste more time on it. The best answer would be: I would never purchase this brand any more to avoid this troubles. I write my story up, just for the people who might have similar issues as me, please keep your EVIDENCES, and don't get your car repaired yet. Hope my experience could help with someone. I personally would never forever purchase this brand of car any more. And be careful when sending your car to have the services in this place. I personally sent my car here for service for at least 6 times, and spent couple thousands dollars here; the first 5 times were good, but as long as once it was not done properly, I had to spend much more money and time, but without anything solved. Thanks for reading, hope it helps.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1563219468830, 'text': "Qianqian, thank you for leaving this detailed feedback about your experience with our dealership.

Excellent car buying experience.
Everything went well, and the sales department made a great follow-up making sure that everything would be ok with my purchase.
They also have provided solution for aftermarket option that were not installed in the car when I purchased it.</review>

This is my second car from Smythe and while I don't know how the service will be going forward, I have been very satisfied in the past with my 2004 E320. We looked at every SUV out there and were torn between the ML350 and the Lexus GX 460. In the end, the Mercedes fit both my husband and myself far better than any vehicle we tried in this category.
We did not feel the least amount of pressure and all in all the buying experience was a pleasure. Certainly would come back for our next vehicle.<//Review>

However as part of service, my car was not cleaned from inside. Also the car given to me as substitute was quite dirty and had food spilled at back seat which nobody cared.<//review>< pictures>

My experience has been that service at Stevens Creek Mercedes is getting worse. Maybe it’s because my car is only a 2012 c250 coupe and over the 60k mileage? Every time I take it in some expensive repair work is suggested. Most of the suggested repair work is after the warranty period expires. In the 70k service, engine mounts were found “collapsed” (estimate to fix $1500). On getting a second opinion outside, it was not cited as an issue. I have been exclusively servicing at Stevens Creek Mercedes. This car has had too many reliability issues starting well before the warranty period expired. Luckily it was covered under warranty upto 50k miles.
At 70k, they informed me I needed to replace front and rear brakes, including drums (cost $1500 in addition to the $1000 servicing), even though rear brakes were recently replaced. At 80k, the ‘front sway bar links’ were also suggested as needing replacement, and in addition, rear tires. All tires were replaced at Mercedes at 70k miles. Previous tires lasted me at least 20k miles. Right from being bought from Mercedes, the right front tire kept losing air pressure gradually especially in cold temperatures, and they claim there is no issue.
I also was unable to get a loaner during service (need to make an appointment 20 days in advance) and it took me over an hour during my work hours to get the shuttle, then took me again more than an hour to get home. They do not pick you up either. For a car that cost me @50k, I expected better reliability and maintenance costs.<//text>

<review>I had the most satisfying experience at Stevens Creek where I bought my GLC. They had gotten the car with my specific options, a very reasonable price. Made the appointment and got in and out in 2 hours. That was a weeknight,it may take a little longer if in a weekend. Overall a very good experience, would highly recommend this dealership.</review>< userid>

We get the car in early in the day and by the afternoon the car is ready for pick up. If we need someone to pick us up, that service is available too.
Steve is excellent in service. He is straight forward and lets us know what service was performed. If there is a problem we know what needs to be done.
It`s so refreshing to have clear cut information. Thanks Steve!< /review><GmapID>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798< /GmapID></record>

<text>I highly recommend Stevens Creek Mercedes. I was immediately welcomed and all staff gave their attention and time to my family and I. Asad Hanif was my salesman and was very helpful and patient. Asad was very understanding of what my family and I wanted in our car. He knew all the inventory and made sure we were comfortable and confident with our big purchase. Asad and his coworkers were very inviting and interested in me. All the staff in Stevens Creek were helpful and polite.</text>< Pics>

Very professional. They identified a couple of problems in the car and fixed it very quickly. Everything was covered in warranty. The service expert was very clear explaining about whats covered in warranty and whats not. Appreciate that unlike other dealerships, they try to be genuine and not try to cheat customers.< /Text>

<Review>I don't like to part with money, but this dealership makes the experience as comfortable as possible plus feeling like I got my money's worth.  This is my sixth Mercedes, and the second that I have bought certified pre-owned, which gives me the best of both worlds, a great car at a reasonable price.  I have serviced my car at Stevens Creek since moving from southern California 15 months ago and always got prompt, efficient, and courteous treatment.  Servicing a Mercedes is not cheap, but the infrequency of need for repair more than makes up for any extra cost.  Buying a car is something I do every 5 years or so and this dealership gives me no regrets.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

They’re attentive when in the process of selling you a 70K+ car but after the purchase and asking us to leave good remarks on a survey it was impossible to get any one to return your call for any follow up questions or issues that came up. I plan to be a long time customer of the Mercedes brand but will take my future business elsewhere.</text>

I received very professional advice from Susan Sulimani regarding the services my car required.
She kept me informed regarding the progress and the service was done on time. I hope on my next visit Susan will be there to advise me again regarding the services my car requires.</Text>

We are very pleased with the purchase experience.  The sales agent, Sam Chao, patiently showed us different models and optional features enabling us to determine what we wanted.  He then found just the vehicle.  We love it. Next, our experience with the service department was a delight.

Always a great experience. Everyone from the person taking your car details to your advisor to the loaner cars are super nice. Been goin here since past 5 years.

As with any Mercedes service tends to be expensive but if you have certain warranty packages you have piece of mind and assurance with genuine parts.</text>

I just bought a E350 for my wife. I had the best buying experience I ever had buying cars over the last 30+ years with Samir, a courteous, pleasant, unassuming and intelligent gentleman there. We liked him very much from the beginning to the end. Wide open and spacious showroom with many models on display and coffee/tea area were lovely too.<//review>

I worked with Martin at the Internet Sales department. We emailed each other without visiting.  He kept checked on me in a few weeks.  We had been thru our emails and decided to come.  I reside in Placer County.

He's very patient with me because I cannot able to hear. We wrote down each other for as our communicate needed.  What's more,  He stayed after hours due to my arrived late from Placer County.  I really appreciated his wait for me.

The dealer's atmosphere is also bright and comfortable. Again, He keeps smile, listened, friendly and felt relax.  There is no pressure.  That's the BEST experience.

He explained all the options/pricing/financial options to me.  He took care of my car,  It's prepped with cleaned and full tanks.  I was ready to return home in Sacramento.

Many Thanks for quality time over with Martin Do!< /Text>

We called and emailed them back to explain how they can allow such lax behavior from their body shop. We didn't get any response from them after our initial message and its been more than a week.

Martin Do (Stevens Creek Mercedes Benz) took time to understand what my preferences were and very quickly provided car option.
The entire process and experience was nothing but seamless and pleasurable.< /text>

It was our first the year-end buying car experience. Considering the number of buyers in the dealer, it was not bad at all. Alan Ziffer gave us a better deal than other dealers with very good interest rate on loan. My wife is happy with the new ML350 with all its cool features, as they said, when the wife is happy, the whole house is happy!<//Review>

drove two and a half hours from Sacramento to come see this car 2006 s65 AMG which in the pictures that were they took pictures it looks excellent they didnt take any pictures of any of the damage and made everything look good did not even indicate that there's any damage to the car drove all the way out here to notice that the front bumpers completely thrash broke in a few different places scratched the side of the car just went through a recent accident with two door scratched up the rear trunk has been damaged and the rims are scratched

The use car manager came out and joked about the car being old and said what do you want it old ... He said he will repaint the doors and bumper and went I mention the broken sections of the bumper all he can say is its a old car..

The headlights both where loose I showed the sales guy and tighten it I front of him..

If the manager doesn't give a s*** and tells me that he's also going to lower the mileage on the car for me by driving it in reverse 🙄🙄🙄</Text>

<Text>The team at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek is why I have 315,000 miles on my 2005 ML350, but even I have to admit there are limits to mechanical devices. Yesterday Charlie Fish and his colleagues recommended equally talented folks in the finance/sales division, and now I have a new ML 350.

I had a great experience with the staff at Smythe on Stevens Creek. They were very friendly and helpful in the purchase of my certified pre-owned Mercedes. I did not feel great pressure to purchase and they were extremely professional. Shawn is a great sales person to work with and makes the experience of buying a vehicle pleasant.</text>

Went it looking to buy a E350 but was surprised to know that they can not give me a test drive without buying insurance and having a CA License first.  I'd walked in having test driven an A6 an hour ago. I'm told they will consider doing me the favour of letting me buy their car and get back to me. Thanks, I think I'll pass.

If this is pre sales, I'm definitely not looking forward to after sales.<//review>

I purchased the 2014 Mercedes-Benz ML 350 on 10/26/2013. I had a great experience.   Glenn was very helpful and offered me with excellent service. After I picked up the car, Glenn showed me again how to use the functions of the car. It took him another 30 minutes.  The price is good. Glenn also called me one week later and asked me how's going my ML's driving. I should say it works perfect and I love it.< /Review>

< Review>
I was in car search all by myself for almost 2 months and boy it was  stressful. Reached Stevens Creek Mercedes a day before labour day and David handled my request. He understood where I stand at and all my concerns. Even the manager came to the picture during the end of this process. As any car dealership, there were some serious negotiations. We came to a common ground and finished the deal. Over all, I made 2 store visits and 4 phone calls. When the deal was finalized, I felt both parties won. As dealers they gained some profit from me. From my end, they treated me with respect (which is a big deal because I visited other brands dealerships too), and I am happy with the car [GLA 250 4Matic] which came around my budget.

Since it is a big dealership I felt intimidated in the beginning. My suggestion to first time car buyers, Don't feel intimidated. This dealership represents a brand. Stick to your budget, be reasonable in your quote and remember you are the buyer.

PS> I am currently happy and recommend this showroom. I hope nothing unexpected comes up and goes side ways in the future though!<//Review>

I worked with Jaspreet Singh at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek and he did a great job in trying to find ways to sell the job. Generally, very good all-around experience.

This is an additional review for Danny Ho. I have had spark plug issue once again on my Mercedes GLC 300. Danny has been extremely receptive to my concerns, ensured that I had a loaner and got the fixes in.< /Text>

Service through a dealership has always been more expensive, yet more personal service and options (such as a loaner car compared to need for a rental car) is appreciated.  What was unfortunate during this service was the loss/misplacement/mishandling of a part during shipment from the East Coast which led to an additional day of the car being in the shop.  This unfortunate situation was understandably not the fault of the dealership, but placed me in an uncomfortable situation with a scheduled trip.< /Text>

Probably the worst purchasing experience I’ve ever had. I still got the car in the end because that’s the only one available in the area, despite the horrible customer service they provided. I guess it’s still the seller’s market when you have very specific requirements for cars.<//text>

Great experience buying at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek! The salesperson, Bryan, was very friendly and patient and went through all the features and packages of the car in detail. Buying experience was one of the smoothest and easiest at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek!</Review>

Purchased my vehicle from Shawn Abtahi at this location. It was a great experience and a great price. Staff were very informative and helpful. I would recommend checking out Steven's Creek MB if you're in the market for a Mercedes!</text>

<text>Best Mercedes-Benz dealership in Bay Area. I ordered a customized 2017 C300 with sports package and included several options. My salesperson Mark Arnold is a very polite and patient gentleman. He helped me with the options in building the car and answered my subsequent queries . I would strongly recommend Mark.<//text>< Pictures>

Martin Do (Stevens Creek Mercedes Benz) took time to understand what my preferences were and very quickly provided car option.
The entire process and experience was nothing but seamless and pleasurable.</Review>

<text>Scheduled appoinment to change airbags at 9 am. Their mechanic was either a no show, got laid off/fired, and mercedes stevens creek didn’t bother to contact me about the change. I was still getting automated messages about the 9 am appointment until three days ago. Until I arrived, they told me and changed their appt to 2 pm. Their messy scheduling wasted my time. If I ever have to return to this Mercedes dealer for anything and hopefully I don’t, it would be with skepticism. Please make sure your schedule is not full when you bring in your car, you might waste time waiting.<//text>< rate>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Great Price, Horrific Customer Service
MBSC Salesman: Kevin Hua
MBSC Sales Manager: Safi Hatoum
MBSC Finance Manager: Aaron Riddle

The E400 would be my 12th Mercedes, second car purchased from MBSC. Out of all my years and all the Mercedes I’ve purchased this is by far the WORST customer service (communication) I’ve experienced from a Mercedes Benz dealership.

I’ve had the worst communication with all levels of MBSC from the salesman Kevin Hua, the Sales Manager Safi Hatoum and Finance Manager Aaron Riddle. To Aaron’s credit he’s given me the most information. The process was so botched that the price of the car dropped while waiting on information.  As of today 26 Apr I’m still waiting for the refund check of $400, the title to the vehicle as well as the vehicle itself. The reason I’m given Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek (MBSC) a 1-star is because my previous experience was the complete opposite of this one. The 1-star is for the price. The lack of communication was so poor I called Mercedes Benz Corporate and requested they make contact with the dealership but they were unable to reach any of the 3 folks and opened a case to help get someone’s attention.

During this experience I can’t understand why MBSC made buying a car such a horrible experience for me.

My son will be turning 16 this year which means I’ll be purchasing another Mercedes in the not so distant future. Given what I know of MBSC I’ll search their inventory find a vehicle with a great price and try my best to get another dealer to match it.

One thing I know about the Mercedes brand is The Best or Nothing. Unfortunately I can’t say the same for MBSC and it’s staff and how I’ve been treated. Communication is free, however the lack of communication will cost a whole lot more.

Timeline of E400 purchase from MBSC:
Friday 5 Apr - request a PO on an E400
Sat 6 Apr - received PO on the E400
Tues 9 Apr - MBSC received my check for the E400
Thurs 11 Apr - I received and signed the contact
Fri 12 Apr - MBSC received signed contract
Tues 16 Apr - I received an email stating the price of the car was lowered by $400
Thurs 18 Apr - Aaron R. emailed me stating he received confirmation of transport. I understood that to mean they would be picking up the vehicle from the dealership.
Thurs 25 Apr - I was contacted by the transportation company
As of today 26 Apr I still haven’t received the car, the title or the $400 check.

I pray no one else will have this experience.

Ron Wood and the team at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek did a great job of explaining the intricacies of my repair, providing a quote and sticking with it. My final bill was even less than the original quote despite them having to do a little more work to bring things up to their standards. Great job, guys!</review>

This is my second car from Smythe and while I don't know how the service will be going forward, I have been very satisfied in the past with my 2004 E320. We looked at every SUV out there and were torn between the ML350 and the Lexus GX 460. In the end, the Mercedes fit both my husband and myself far better than any vehicle we tried in this category.
We did not feel the least amount of pressure and all in all the buying experience was a pleasure. Certainly would come back for our next vehicle.</Review>

<review>Service at this location is lacking customer service one would hope for at a luxury car dealership. My vehicle has never been returned washed or cleaned, always dirtier inside than when turned in. This is not a one off incident; car has been turned in at least 4 times to this location. Loaner vehicles are usually dirty outside and inside as well. This time the loaner car had a sticky substance on the seat; that was a weird and unpleasant experience. To make matters worse, the one service advisor that was helpful is no longer at this location. The new person I was assigned to called me a total of 5 times in a 24 time period, to ask me for info that I left with the people who checked me in. So clearly, they are not communicating internally. For the amount of money a MB costs, and how expensive the service fees are, do yourself a favor and go to another location.<//review><GmapID>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798</GmapID>< Response>

<text>I am really disappointed, two times I had appointment, and 2 times they didn't wait for me. I waited for appointment first time 2 weeks, second time 1 week. My crack became super big during that time. Now I am waiting my car 1 week, they did not give me car for replacement... They didn't have wind shield for my car, I was waiting appointment 1 week and they didn't prepare it for me... I feel bad,I have premium car , I pay for expensive service, but I got missed appointments,  no car for replacement for more than week, and  waisting of time and money .</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I was in car search all by myself for almost 2 months and boy it was  stressful. Reached Stevens Creek Mercedes a day before labour day and David handled my request. He understood where I stand at and all my concerns. Even the manager came to the picture during the end of this process. As any car dealership, there were some serious negotiations. We came to a common ground and finished the deal. Over all, I made 2 store visits and 4 phone calls. When the deal was finalized, I felt both parties won. As dealers they gained some profit from me. From my end, they treated me with respect (which is a big deal because I visited other brands dealerships too), and I am happy with the car [GLA 250 4Matic] which came around my budget.

Since it is a big dealership I felt intimidated in the beginning. My suggestion to first time car buyers, Don't feel intimidated. This dealership represents a brand. Stick to your budget, be reasonable in your quote and remember you are the buyer.

PS> I am currently happy and recommend this showroom. I hope nothing unexpected comes up and goes side ways in the future though!< /Text>

Had the best experience ever with Mark Arnold, an awesome salesmen and Stan Mojaisky the GM of MB of Stevens Creek.  The time they took with me to listen to my concerns and expectations on my purchase and help they gave with making my buying  experience special.  Thanks guys for your great customer service and genuine concern and making all of my family feel special.< /Review>

Made appointment for service and car was checked in on time. The items I was interested in addressing were noted and responded to. I did not perceive that my concern regarding low tire pressures was entirely adequately addressed, but otherwise the experience met my expectations.<//Review>

<Text>Their service is terrible, I did 10K maintenance with them, they even don’t give a car wash after maintenance. More terrible thing is that, my front tire is broken after hit the hole in the high way before send to them, they didn’t even found the front tire is broken, and handed car back to me without notice, it was found by myself, I think they are very unprofessional and unresponsable.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Dropped off my BED (B-Class Electric Drive) for an interior issue.  I received a nice loaner for the weekend as they kept troubleshooting the problem.  Due to a severe parts shortage by MB this issue will be fixed at a later time but they gave me a viable workaround in the meantime and got my car back in a few days all nice and cleaned.

Troy was awesome and kept me in the loop daily so I was apprised of the situation with the parts.

I will definitely return to MB of Stevens Creek.  Their staff was quite helpful and made a painful experience (any car issue) much more palatable.< /text>

We shopped online for specific car we were interested in and called Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek to inquire about it. Bryan Tu emailed us immediately to reserve the car and make an appointment. We were traveling from Los Angeles and despite having to reschedule our initial appointment, everyone we spoke to over the phone were extremely friendly and helpful. Upon arriving, we test drove the car and knew we wanted to purchase it. They worked with us and made it happen!! It was a lengthly process but they went above and beyond in their customer service.< /Review>

I worked with the most amazing team at Mercedes Benz Stevens Creek. My sales executive Hovik, was incredible. he found me the car I wanted within 48 hours. He was super nice, attentive and extremely helpful. He checked in on me after the sale was completed a few times. My finance person and the GSM were super helpful as well. Overall, I can say that I have found my dealership from which I will purchase my cars from.< /text>

Great experience! Thanks to Steve Kirksey for your professional service.  From the time I was greeted in the driveway to picking up my GLE you and your staff did an incredible job.  The service was quick, completed sooner than promised.  My vehicle was cleaned and ready to go.  As we all know, our time is all too valuable in this hectic world, and I appreciate the quick, professional, and thoroughly enjoyable experience.< /review>

Servicing my car there is consistently excellent. Here's the reason why: my service adviser, John Stansberry  keeps me constantly up to date on any little thing that he finds/does on the car. He patiently explains why I need this or that. He lets me know approximately when the car will be ready, I never have to wonder or call him & ask.

The attitude of the sales person got me so demotivated I lost all my enthusiasm about buying a new car.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1522032206707, 'text': "Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

I did my car service on 14 Jan 2021 and everyone was using mask. Also  waiting area was clean. My service advisor Troy Schalk provided excellent service. He followed-up with me later to make sure that there are no issues with the car.</review>

<review>My wife and I had an appointment to see a 2017 E300. It took 6.5 hours (I have the documentation) to negotiate the price and complete the paperwork. This was the 5th Mercedes I have purchased and the worst sales experience. The car was missing a trunk "comfort box" (as pictured on Carfax) and I was promised I would be contacted within a week to arrange for the installation. We have not yet been contacted. If you wish to respond, please use email as we are watching our grandchildren.
It's now two months later and after several emails and contact with the home office I have not been contacted by this dealership.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1525691196500, 'text': "Russ, thank you for leaving this detailed feedback about your experience with our dealership.

I had my car serviced at MB of Stevens Creek last week early AM.  When I dropped off my car to give my service technician the keys, she said that I should wait by my car until 7:30am.  I was really disappointed and wanted to drive away to another dealer.  I know that the owners of MB Stevens Creek built that location for customer comfort and 5 star service for customers buying a car or getting routine service.  I was sadly told to wait by my car early Wednesday morning until 7:30am.  I don't know if I will return.</text>

I needed to get my radio 'code' because of a recent change of battery.
When I first called, I was given a code, and was told that if it did not work, I would have to come into the dealer and get it set, but that the service would be free.  So I said, "Can I make an appointment now, so that if it does not work, I already have an appointment?  And he told me, "No, you do not need an appointment, just drop in.  It is like a 15 minute process"
The code which I was given did not work, so several days later, I called to verify that I could just drop in, or whether I needed an appointment.  This time, it was a lady whom I was speaking to, and she said "No, you do not need an appointment, just drop in.  It is a 10 minute process".
So the following Friday, I took time off from work and went in to the dealer.
I checked in with the receptionist, and was told to go to the waiting area, which I did.  Half an hour later, nothing had happened, so I checked with the receptionist, and she called to the repair shop.  Then she told me, "Sorry, things have changed, and now you need an appointment for that service, and we cannot do it now".
Needless to say, I made an appointment for a week later (The earliest that they could do it).
So once more, I had to take time off from work.  I checked in and they took the car.  An hour and a half later, I was told it was ready, and when I retrieved the keys from the Service Representative, he told me that it wold be $95.00 !!!!!!!!!).

I explained to him the whole ordeal and I refused to pay.</text>

This five star are only give for the sale associate Jorainna(well the guy who made the paperwork also nice and cool), cuz she is the actual reason that we choose keep dealing with the shop, with out her I feel I’m actually bagging them to sale the car to me:) anyway, car is good, nice and shiny,and I really hope that your team can do some updates such as get rid of some useless person, because I think it’s super rare to meet some customers as positive as me, even there is a guy want to do some purchasing after walking in to the shop,but high percentage the deal will screw after having chat with some helper in there:))< /text>

<Review>This review is based on my experience at the show room only.  Never had a vehicle serviced here before so don't know anything about that.

Came to the show room last Wednesday late afternoon around 6pm. My girlfriend and I were there to check out a few specific models and hoped to get a few questions answered about the vehicles. Not busy there on a Wednesday as expected. We can see the receptionist sitting facing the main entrance as we walked in, and there were other staffs sitting in their cubicles on the sides. We walked around the show room and casually checking out the vehicles for almost 10 mins, and not a single person there greeted us. No "hello", nothing. I walked up to one of the sales reps and asked if he can help answer questions about a specific model and he came over to the vehicle we were looking at. My girlfriend was in the driver seat, and I stood by the passenger side with the door opened so the three of us can talk. I asked about 5 questions, and one by one the sales rep answered succinctly. I asked if we can have some printed materials / brochures of the model for us to take home, and the rep told me there isn't any (OK, it's 2018, it's possible they've gone completely digital, but it still felt weird). Then the rep gestured I move away from the door and said, "Let's not leave the door opened, it's draining the battery."  Are you f---ing serious?

I gave a 2 stars rating because the place is kept nice and clean. Otherwise I would have given just 1. This is no way to treat any potential customers.< /Review><user_name>Vince Ho</user_name><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

My service experience was adequate but not stellar.  Jake Tran, my service advisor, was knowledgable and attentive, but certain outcomes left a bit to be desired.

Ever since I owned the car, I noticed a pulse in the tires.  After three days in service, the technicians determined that the alignment was fine and diagnosed the problem as occurring due to cupping of the front tires.  I have had the car for only a few months, and according to the manager, the tire warranty period had already passed.  They offered no explanation as to the cause of the cupping.   He offered me a 20% on new tires--yes, replacements after only 8K miles--but I declined because I knew they would charge the usual dealership-inflated prices (no pun intended).

Now I have two options:  tolerate the pulse until the tires wear out, or buy new tires.  Neither option is appealing, and neither was my service experience.< /Text>

Hats off...fantastic experience! This dealership was highly recommended by my parents, who are both long-time clients. Indeed, their customer service is truly top-notch.

Eddie, Stan, and Omar went out of their way to make sure my husband and I were more than satisfied with our purchase. These three individuals made us feel comfortable the entire time, not to mention the overwhelming accommodation they have extended. In addition, Ruben, in the Parts Deparment, also went out of his way to assist us with our querries and requests.

We have been to many different dealerships (MB, BMW, Porsche, Land Rover) in the past and what we appreciate the most here was that they were all very professional and transparent. Needless to say, this dealership, by far, raised the bar in terms of customer relations and client satisfaction.< /review>

<text>I usually dont post reviews but the service (or rather severe lack of) needs to be known by prospective customers Look at the yelp reviews for more similar stories. Here were my highlights at Stevens creek benz:

1. Damaged rims after service. They only fixed them once I revealed I had evidence. Refused to switch them, now have refurbished rims due to their negligence. Take pictures of your car before servicing anywhere. Take a picture of your mileage. Important for #2

2. The car was driven 10 miles for a simple oil change. There is absolutely no reason a customer car should be driven more than a mile for an oil change. It was obvious it was driven for non-service related activities.

3. No uber or shuttle service. They rarely have rental cars available, but they offer no uber or shuttle service alternative. I haven't been to a single dealership (let alone a luxury brand) that does not offer a ride service for appointments that last several hours.

4. Incompetence. The one instance I got a rental car, I was given the keys and led to the rental car. The keys did not work, so I checked the license plate number on the rental form and they did not match the car I was led to. The young teenager (appeared very young) that was responsible for the rental service gave me attitude insisting it was the correct car until I had to physically point to the differences in license plate numbers. This is ridiculous for a German luxury brand dealership that demands a premium fee in exchange for professional service.  You get none of that here. Only the premium price.

Benz owners beware of this place.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><text>From the day I came in to just take a test drive to the day I got my new car, Gurwinder was always professional, courteous and informative. He promptly responded to any of my questions and concerns. This is truly the best experience I have ever had at a car dealership. The deal I got was amazing: All my friends/family were totally impressed with my experience at MB of Stevens Creek. It isn't often that sharing a story about a trip to a car dealership is inspiring or makes one feel appreciated. Everyone was courteous and I felt as if they were truly trying to help me drive home with a Benz. I have to also thank Stan, the sales manager who really took care of me. He went above and beyond to make it happen. And Kamal, the financial services manager was extremely friendly and helpful! I was lucky at every step of the way.

Taking my C300 there for a service was absolutely the best experience I have ever had at a car dealer.  I've owned both Mercedes and Lexus in Japan where they know a thing or two about customer service but MB of Stevens Creek takes things a step up to the next level.

Totally smooth service process at every step of the way, from booking in my car, to explaining the work details to arranging for a shuttle for me. Every single person I met working there is an outstanding professional who understand how a business should treat it's customers. I wish every business in America could spend some time as a fly on the wall here to learn how it really should be done. I will never consider service at a 3rd party again after this experience. If I had to single out a member of staff it has to be Troy Schalk who is the ultimate professional and gentleman.< /Review>

<review>I purchased the 2014 Mercedes-Benz ML 350 on 10/26/2013. I had a great experience.   Glenn was very helpful and offered me with excellent service. After I picked up the car, Glenn showed me again how to use the functions of the car. It took him another 30 minutes.  The price is good. Glenn also called me one week later and asked me how's going my ML's driving. I should say it works perfect and I love it.<//review><Gmap_id>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798</Gmap_id><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

I received outstanding service. From the moment that I entered the dealership , I was immediately greeted by Charlie Shen. He patiently explain the different aspect of the GLE350 SUV that we are thinking of buying and after that my wife take a test drive in one. The negotiation of price is also relatively painless and straight forward. When we take delivery of the car, again Charlie explain things in detail how to operate very patiently. It is a good experience buying this SUV from Stevens Creek and I will go back there after my E320 becomes too old. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give Charlie a 11!< /Text>

Our 100% reliable Sprinter RV suddenly showed warning lights and we had reservations for the next week that could not be cancelled.

I am truly happy and satisfied with the amount of help and support Smythe European employees have given me.  Stan Mojaisky gave his time and effort to help me feel at ease in buying a car.  I was anxious since I have had no car payments for almost 7 years, but the employees from Smythe made me feel at home.  Bryan, the Finance Manager, explained and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of owning a Mercedes Benz.  After a few days, I went back so they can detail clean/shine my car.  My experience with the whole staff is excellent, and their customer service is very consistent.  I love consistency; as a result, I definitely recommend Smythe European Mercedes Benz dealership to all future owners of luxury vehicles.  Good luck!<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>We bought a car from them, which was actually a good experience.  The problem was that when we attempted to get a refund for the pre-paid service and extended warranty a year later, they ignored all our calls.  We had to physically go to the dealership to sign the cancellation paper.  After 8 weeks we hadn't received our money back and another Mercedes dealer confirmed they still hadn't processed our cancellation.  Left multiple messages for both the finance manager and general manager, no one returned my calls. Had to contact the BBB and Autonation corporate office in order to get the refund.  Will not go there again.  Changed to Mercedes of Monterey which has superior service.< /Text>< pics>

< review>
Haven't bought a car in a while, and was dreading the process. Working with Shawn Abtahi at Smythe European was totally different from what I expected.

The process was fair and amiable. Negotiations were direct and clear. At no time did I feel pressured to make a commitment. In fact, at one point I walked out and they just let me go.

I was looking for a used car and they had taken one similar to what I wanted in trade. The car had been thoroughly inspected, serviced and cleaned. They even treated me to a full tank of gas.

I can recommend dealing with Shawn and seeing what he can do for you. His background is from the Hospitality industry, and it really shows.<//review>

Hats off...fantastic experience! This dealership was highly recommended by my parents, who are both long-time clients. Indeed, their customer service is truly top-notch.

Eddie, Stan, and Omar went out of their way to make sure my husband and I were more than satisfied with our purchase. These three individuals made us feel comfortable the entire time, not to mention the overwhelming accommodation they have extended. In addition, Ruben, in the Parts Deparment, also went out of his way to assist us with our querries and requests.

We have been to many different dealerships (MB, BMW, Porsche, Land Rover) in the past and what we appreciate the most here was that they were all very professional and transparent. Needless to say, this dealership, by far, raised the bar in terms of customer relations and client satisfaction.< /Review>

My wife and I had an appointment to see a 2017 E300. It took 6.5 hours (I have the documentation) to negotiate the price and complete the paperwork. This was the 5th Mercedes I have purchased and the worst sales experience. The car was missing a trunk "comfort box" (as pictured on Carfax) and I was promised I would be contacted within a week to arrange for the installation. We have not yet been contacted. If you wish to respond, please use email as we are watching our grandchildren.
It's now two months later and after several emails and contact with the home office I have not been contacted by this dealership.< /Text>

<Text>We bought a new GLK 350 last week and we had an excellent experience. We had not taken an appointment for our test drive but we were promptly set up with Walter, our sales person. I have to say Walter took care of us very well and his entire approach was very refined (much like the Mercedes brand itself). He was understanding and accommodating, allowing us to take our time as we fiddled around with the instrument cluster and figured out how to use the various gadgets. In fact he took us to a lot where they keep a bunch of new models so that we had first hand experience with all the different options and colors. He even took the trouble of lining up the different cars side by side to help us make a decision. He spent about 3 hrs with us that day and we never felt rushed. He was very knowledgeable about the cars, the history of the brand and also had some nice tidbits about Smythe's own history in the valley.

We decided to buy the car 2 days later. The decision was based on the virtues of the product but the buying experience always has a big part to play for my wife and me. Completing the purchase with the finance department was just as smooth. Nick, the finance manager, had no trouble with redoing our contract thrice due to changes in how we wanted to finance the purchase.

I highly recommend based on our experience.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Most frustrating Mercedes dealership ever! Walked into this dealership around 6:30PM on 8/25/15, absolutely no one cared to help. The sales reps outside were "busy" when I approached them for help, although they were not helping any customers at the time. l went to the receptionist, asked to see a sales person and she responds "I'll go get you someone." several minutes later, no one came out. the other reps inside seemed "busy" on their computers with absolutely no customers with them. I walked away. Don't worry, I purchased my C300 yesterday, but elsewhere. It's my 3rd Mercedes purchase. If I wasn't a young black man in a t-shirt, fitted jeans and a pair of sneakers, maybe, just maybe I would have gotten the attention of one of your many sales reps<//text>

I recently bought a vehicle from this place. Excellent sales and management staff. They handled everything very professionally.
I worked with Jo (Joachim Meier) and PJ and they were both wonderful. Definitely will recommend for future MB customers.< /Text>

<text>So I bought a 2011 Toyota 4Runner from Mohammed at Smythe European about two weeks ago, and I absolutely love it!!!  I originally found the SUV online at the Toyota Dealership in Hayward which is a sister dealership.  I wanted to purchase from Smythe European because of their reviews and my dad lives close to there which would make it easier for me since I wanted him to go with me to look things over.  Mo  took the time to pick up the car for me from Hayward, drive it back down to San Jose and had it all ready for me when I got there.  Completely professional, helpful and kind, Mo was wonderful to work with.
Brian, the finance manager I worked with was equally as AMAZING! He had everything ready for me when I got to the dealership and I was there probably less then an hr purchasing the vehicle. Brian made signing my name 1000xs on that crazy long contract fun and exciting. :)
It's hands down the best experience purchasing a car I've ever had.  My dad was so impressed he might be back for a Mercedes for my step-mom.
Also, on a side note....when I got home, I noticed the side door had scratches on it that I didn't notice before (it actually says "Ho", which I thought was amazing).  I called the dealership and was told not to worry, they would write a work order for it, call me to make an appointment and have it taken care of.  Top notch service, manners and all around great experience!< /text>< userid>

<review>GLE 2018 4MATIC with amg package is really perfect!

Most reason I bought this car from AutoNation is the saleslady Jorainna Yao. She is really patient and helpful.
I would also referred my friend to buy a Mercedes 2020/2019 GLE amg 43 next year to her.

Also the car is beautiful ! Easy to handle and control. Very comfortable for a tall guy.<//review>< Pictures>

Brought E350 in for what turned out to be a faulty fuel pump, covered by MBZ recall warranty. Disappointed that MBZ of Stevens Creek tried to push an add'l diagnostic ($220). Also, when I picked up the car,  the console around the gear shift wasn't seated properly. They did fix it. Very, very busy place and didn't get great customer service as a result.</text>

Went in on 3/13/15 Friday to lease a C350 Coupe. Omar was the sale REP. who helped me to get a great deal. He spent fair amount of time to show me the features and options for this car.I fell in love with this car since. Great job Omar. I will refer all my friends to you.</review>

The service advisor was good and knowledgeable. The only complain I had was that they did not provide transportation for picking up when the car's ready. You had to call a Uber or a friend to give you a ride.< /Text>

< Review>
I bought a new Metris van and I couldn't be happier. Our sales person Shawn was incredibly patient and helpful during the entire process, even though it took me three separate visits before I was ready to make the final decision! I have people coming up to me almost every day to ask about the van and I tell each and every one of them to go see Shawn. As far as the dealership experience, it was strictly "first cabin".</Review>

Purchased a used vehicle here.  They were the nicest people at first.....until I signed the contract and took vehicle delivery.  There was a small problem with the vehicle and I wanted to see proof it was inspected for safety before selling.  I was basically ignored.
I would expect more from a luxury car dealer.</review>

Great cars, Great staff, Great prices and Great service. I've asked a sales rep why i should prefer a Merc vs. any other car and he just explained every single feature of a fairly complex car which made the decision making easy.< /review>

Scheduled appoinment to change airbags at 9 am. Their mechanic was either a no show, got laid off/fired, and mercedes stevens creek didn’t bother to contact me about the change. I was still getting automated messages about the 9 am appointment until three days ago. Until I arrived, they told me and changed their appt to 2 pm. Their messy scheduling wasted my time. If I ever have to return to this Mercedes dealer for anything and hopefully I don’t, it would be with skepticism. Please make sure your schedule is not full when you bring in your car, you might waste time waiting.< /Text>

<date>1550852343070<//date><rating>3<//rating><Review>I was a bit disappointed this time with my service experience. Historically, my experience has been extraordinary and this time it was not. I’m not sure if it’s because I don’t have a new car anymore or what the issue was but the overall feel wasn’t the same. It used to feel like MBZ would do all they could to make their customers happy. This time was definitely not the case.

I spend extra money to have a tire package on my car. I am in the dealer fairly frequently to have service done. I was there this time at 74,000 miles for my 80,000 mile check. There was a nail in one of my tires and they wouldn’t cover it on the package because it only covers tires with 3/32 of tread and I had 2/32. All my maintenance records say “tire tread ok”. Then why all of a sudden is it a problem?!? Not ok.

Also, I was there on 1/18 because something was dragging under my car. A lovely gentleman in the cashiers office helped me and brought my car back to the technician to have them put screws in it to secure it. This visit, apparently permanently fixing that is over $1000?!? I cannot pay for that plus the maintenance so declined at this time. My paperwork says “customer refused service”. Ummm I don’t think so. I declined at this time due to finances. I already was out $2000!

Overall a bit unhappy.

I was convinced I wanted a GLE next. I’m now looking at Audi’s and Lincoln’s.</Review>< pics>

Good overall experience.  The dealer did a great job.  The GLE 450 Coupe is a fantastic car.  This is the second car I bought at this dealer in the last four months.< /review>

I set an appointment to have my airbag replaced.  When I arrived at Stevens Creek Mercedes, however, I waited about an hour before they informed me that they no longer had the part.  They never should have setup the appointment if they didn't have the part in the first place.  Basically wasted my whole morning and time off work for nothing.  They were sorry it happened but it was still very unprofessional.  I was disappointed.</review>

I was a bit disappointed this time with my service experience. Historically, my experience has been extraordinary and this time it was not. I’m not sure if it’s because I don’t have a new car anymore or what the issue was but the overall feel wasn’t the same. It used to feel like MBZ would do all they could to make their customers happy. This time was definitely not the case.

I spend extra money to have a tire package on my car. I am in the dealer fairly frequently to have service done. I was there this time at 74,000 miles for my 80,000 mile check. There was a nail in one of my tires and they wouldn’t cover it on the package because it only covers tires with 3/32 of tread and I had 2/32. All my maintenance records say “tire tread ok”. Then why all of a sudden is it a problem?!? Not ok.

Also, I was there on 1/18 because something was dragging under my car. A lovely gentleman in the cashiers office helped me and brought my car back to the technician to have them put screws in it to secure it. This visit, apparently permanently fixing that is over $1000?!? I cannot pay for that plus the maintenance so declined at this time. My paperwork says “customer refused service”. Ummm I don’t think so. I declined at this time due to finances. I already was out $2000!

Overall a bit unhappy.

I was convinced I wanted a GLE next. I’m now looking at Audi’s and Lincoln’s.< /review>

< Review>
"One person can make a big difference to the entire organization". I realized it here.

I have been visiting this dealership for service ever since I owned a Merc from Oct 2013. I am seeing a drastic change in the service reception area starting Feb or March this year. In the past when I used to drive, I will see lot of chaos and poor management of customers. I have myself waited a long time with no one attending. See - when you goto service, the one and only thing you need is to be attended soon and taken care properly. Things changed from Feb / Mar this year. I have visited the area 3 to 4 times for service and maintenance reasons since Feb this year.
This staff - Kristina Bowman has been adding great value to Customers since then. As we drive in, she quickly takes care of the customers and she is fast with lot of energy. She also keeps asking the customers how she can help to make sure they are fully taken care and leave the dealership with a smile. Very rare to find a staff who keeps Customer in front and everything aside.
That is Kristina for you. And with Kristina Bowman, this dealership service experience is excelled many times. Excellent job!!!

I also want to thank my service advisor Elizabeth Pierce. I have been twice put to Elizabeth and at both times she kept me educated on what is expected and what is not expected. Setting the expectations right is the key to Customer satisfaction particularly when it comes to giving your car for service. She is very good at that. Also, she follows up diligently on when the car is available and keeps me posted. There is zero ambiguity with Elizabeth and she makes me feel special all the time. Particularly this time when I dropped my car, I had a few things, very small things, but she took notes on everything and made sure everything is taken care of. When I picked up my car, on that particular day, she was not there - but still whatever I told has been completely taken care. This is called Customer Delight. I happily drove my car back and happy to have serviced in this dealership.

With one person out in the drive in "Kristina Bowman", with one person inside "Elizabeth Pierce" - this dealership makes a big difference now. Keep up the excellent work and thanks for taking care of Customers.< /Review>

This was our first time buying Mercedes. The experience of buying from Stevens Creek Mercedes was great.  We had come in the dealership with exactly knowing the car that we wanted to look at & test drive.  Samir K. helped us test-drive the car. He was great, he explained us the difference between Mercedes drive compared to other cars and features of the C300. We ended up leasing a new C300. The finance manager was helpful. It’s been few days since we bought the car and so far we absolutely love it. Thanks Samir K!</Text>

<Review>My service adviser, John, was kind and was actively listening. Main problem of my car was oil leaking but there was another minor issue on door lock. I know someone can fix it easily but if not, it can be up to $300 to fix it. John fixed it in a minute for free!< /Review>< Pics>

Martin Do at Stevens Creek is patient and knowledgeable.  We communicated for a few weeks by email as I was very picky about the model I wanted and the price I was willing to pay.
I love my new purchase, a 2014 GLK350 4Matic, and everyone at Stevens Creek Mercedes was kind and helpful, understanding the magnitude of the purchase.
Thank you Martin and everyone else at Stevens Creek Mercedes.< /Text>

My purchase of my new 2017 Subaru Impreza was smooth, fast and easy! ASAD was extremely helpful and kept great communication with me! His customer service was top notch and I would highly recommend his services to ANYONE!! This was such a great experience I would definitely be returning for any other car purchases especially just to deal with ASAD!!! Thanks for your services<//Review>

<review>The laziest dealership I’ve ever seen. I was inside for 20 mins and no one even walked up to ask if I needed help. Then when I asked someone to pull up a Mercedes GLE so I can take a look nothing happened for 30 mins so we left. If you want to buy a car shop in the LA area instead. They have much better prices there and CS is amazing.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Very unhappy with the level of customer service i recieved. My husband bought an extended warranty on our vehicle. The CS representative told us that they had the parts that were replaced on our vehicle. When the warranty representative showed up for the inspection they no longer had the defective parts. Cost us $1700<//review>

I got first class treatment from John Kolander and the rest of team. I have been coming to this dealership for years. Service is always first class. I have been getting the very best treatment from John Stansbury, My service adviser. He is the very best service adviser, I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. What Can I say. Top Quality of product and services is the key to their success. And what brings me back every time.< /Review>

I just bought a new car from Sami and it was nothing short of a great experience. He communicated via email which is much appreciate when compared to other dealerships that constantly call you. Everyone I worked with was helpful and friendly and, providing my car doesn't have any unforeseen issues, I would purchase from Sami again in the future.</Review>

<Review>GLE 2018 4MATIC with amg package is really perfect!

Most reason I bought this car from AutoNation is the saleslady Jorainna Yao. She is really patient and helpful.
I would also referred my friend to buy a Mercedes 2020/2019 GLE amg 43 next year to her.

Also the car is beautiful ! Easy to handle and control. Very comfortable for a tall guy.<//Review>< resp>

<review>My rating is mainly for finance department. I had great experience with sales representative and loved the car. After signing the lease, they started asking for more down-payment. They are not clear about their policies. It was really unprofessional to finalize on one thing and then change the terms. The whole process took 10 days and was very frustrating and inconvenient.< /review>< user_id>

<review>The worst service advisors They are bullies and humiliate you to no end. Yes so much attitude arrogance, wasted time and feel they are ALWAYS RIGHT!! no regard for the well being of a CUSTOMER!!! the saying customer is always right treat them with respect and loyalty will follow is not their standards of how to deal with CUSTOMERS. They really are bullies and trickles all the way up and especially Jay Faulkner and Jack. Thousands and I means thousands of dollars later and still car is not fixed properly. Got the state board of automotive repairs involved. The attitude we have been in being doing this 30 years they are not in touch with reality!!!!!<//review>< pics>

<Review>My experience at this dealership was really awesome. They give you what you really ask for. I had spec'ed out the details of the car online even before going to the dealership. Rather than just selling me what they had, they genuinely found the car I wanted. They even had it transported form another place.
They are very responsive and keep in touch with you through the entire process.
I felt like I was never pushed at any of the stages. The entire process was just a couple of days.
I worked with Diana and Samir, they are really awesome... I highly recommend this place.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I spent ~$1300 for my GLC300 windshield replacement only to find out that my sensor system was messed up. After taking home my car, the sensor intermittently  telling me the front hood is not closed, a situation never happened before bringing the car to them. Called, no body replied yet.<//text>

Service reps are nice although could be better. Not sure what have been done to the car, until I asked. Still not sure who qualifies and how to arrange a loaner. I used shuttle car that day, which is not bad although I have to wait a little bit.<//text>

After purchasing my 4th car, I must say, Tony Woods is THE BEST salesmen I have worked with. If you are in the market for a high end car, I HIGHLY recommend working with him.

I drove SIX hours, to purchase my C250 from Tony. That should speak volumes!

Tony gives 110% to all customers that walk through his door. His skills are 2nd to none.
Patience, Attentiveness, Clear Communication Skills, Knowledge of the Product, A Calming Presence, Goal Oriented Focus, Tenacity, Prompt, and Efficient.

Tony, without a doubt, is an asset to Smythe European.< /text>

I bought my E320 from Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek in 2002, and I have had the same service advisor for 14yrs (Charlie Fish) at this dealership; Charlie is always diligent, prompt followups, courteous and above all very knowledgeable on every question I have had over the years; Prompt service & relevant guidance has kept my Car going well for all the 16yrs I have had this Mercedes-Benz.<//review>

<review>The last time I was treated like this I was in the home of Johnnie Cochran before the OJ trial.  I went in to buy a van which I am a Mercedes owner of a sprinter and I just couldn't get anybody to pay attention to me

I did ask a salesperson and he said he would find another sales person they could sell it to me because the main person who sells commercial was off that day  they did ask me to set an appointment with the person during the week but it's a small business owner and very very busy so I refused I wanted to buy a van that evening

The salesperson went to the front door and talk to a bunch of other sales people they look my direction and then walked away and even when I walked in the front door had coffee and waiting in the lobby for over 20 minutes nobody even asked me if I needed anything.

If your contractor I wouldn't go here to buy your Mercedes Sprinter or even commercial minivan. I felt like a second-class citizen.

I will go somewhere else to buy my new Mercedes commercial van< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1511354798215, 'text': "We're disappointed to see your low star rating, David.

My wife and I were assisted by Mark Arnold at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek when we decided to purchase a new GLC. We scheduled a test drive with Mark and after we decided to go for the vehicle, Mark guided us with the optional features/packages and locate a vehicle that was in the Bay Area and available within a couple of days. We really loved our interaction with Mark who was super nice through out the process and never pushed us with anything. So I highly recommend going to MB of Stevens Creek and going with Mark! One nit with the overall process - there was a fair amount of paperwork involving writing and signing with pen on paper. A (green) improvement could be to make all of that online and use Docusign.<//text>

I just got a CLA-250 Mercedes in Stevens Creek. The experience of bying it was one of the most pleasant I had so far with cars. The stuff was very attentive. They recommend me the sport model that I now enjoy very much. In addition to giving me a very good rate, they explained and showed all features of this new car. They also suggested that I can ask any questions I had about new electronic controls that makes this car so comfortable and enjoyable to drive. I greatly recommend the Stevens Creek dealership to anybody who is considering to buy a Mercedes.< /review>

<Text>My rating is mainly for finance department. I had great experience with sales representative and loved the car. After signing the lease, they started asking for more down-payment. They are not clear about their policies. It was really unprofessional to finalize on one thing and then change the terms. The whole process took 10 days and was very frustrating and inconvenient.<//Text>< Resp>

I got the car for my wife and the experience was very pleasant and with outstanding service provided by Omar Awwad. Omar and the finance team was very attentive, knowledgable, respectful and professional. The actual entire purchasing process was so efficient, easy, no pressure and we completely happy with the experience. I certainly would highly recommend MB of Stevens Creek and Omar as the location and sale rep to get the MB for your new car. You can't ask anything better.</text>

Worst service you could find in the bay

Booked an 2:40pm service appointment online, arrived at store on time and I was told the service department cannot do service because it's too late. Also they claimed that they have tried to call me before the appointment about rescheduling, but in reality they never did.

Total waste of time!<//Review>

John my service advisory had my paperwork ready the second I drove up. I had my car dropped off in seconds and on my way back to work in no time at all. He gave me a great deal on a set a new tires as well.</Text>

Got my 2014 E350 at Smythe this weekend. Kristof did an excellent job explaining and demonstrating all available options on this brand new model and helped to select exactly the ones I wanted. If you are in the market for an MB vehicle, you will be well served by him at Smythe.</Review>

<review>Despite being a big dealership, Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek (specifically Susan Sulimani) was able to process me quickly when I brought the car in and provide a loaner.

Excellent service as usual from John Stansbury!  Everything is taken care of within 2 hours, and even my car battery was replaced free of charge (with extra batteries left for my next time).  These are the little touches that makes Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek my favorite place to purchase and service my car.<//Review>

I was lucky to have met Slava, who took a direct, no-frills approach to presenting the car (my first MB, a 2016 C300). Between arriving at the dealership and a test drive, hardly 30 minutes had passed, and I already knew everything I needed about the car. Slava was extremely thorough, and was nice enough to follow me home on his own car to gather a few signatures from the wife. Great experience.<//Text>

<review>I purchased my 2nd vehicle from Mercedes Benz because the first experience was amazing. Sadly, my second purchase leaves me extremely unhappy with the customer service and follow through. As a result, I can not recommend this dealership, nor will I purchase from you in future. Joseph Arrighi and Cindy (Thanh) Hodge were supposed to assist me, but instead they have been procrastinating and toying with me.  am waiting for over a month on a resolution, but they keep jerking me around - to put it politely. I have been trying to get the name of the owner or General Manager so that I can pursue this matter. I am owed $795. I will file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and file a small claims action unless I receive my funds. The car loan has been paid and this amount is due back to me.
I met with all your requirements, but Cindy went on vacation supposedly and Joseph has no clue what happened to my documents, so he is telling me I need to submit my request for my money all over again and it may take up to 8 weeks. This is unacceptable.
Additionally, not even a month after my vehicle purchase, I am having issues with the car.
It saddens me to see my trust trampled on. I loved my initial buying experience in 2009, but at this juncture, because of the poor customer service and lack of interest in me as a return customer, I can not recommend you. My $795 seems more important to you than my loyalty.
I am asking for a prompt response and refund. Thank you.</review>< GmapID>

<review>I own two C-class cars and had them serviced by this dealership during warranty. One was OK, not great. They eventually solved all issues although at times it would take several tries and return visits. On another they never were able to fix climate control which seems to be responding to the outside temp rather than to the inside, never solved GPG problem which occasionally misplaces my car. The worst was high latitude stalling. When going to Tahoe or LA over I5 the car stalled climbing to about 4000 feet. Then it would "rest" for about 30 minutes and not have the same problem until another trip up. These guys charged me for full diagnostic and could not find a problem. They suggested to "try using another car key" because the car "is finicky"...  They then bombarded me with emails insisting on giving them highest service rating in a survey sent by MB. I did not but MB did not seem to care. All these surveys are a marketing show.

An independent mechanic instantly diagnosed the problem as a sticking air intake sensor and fixed it for less that cost of diagnostics at the dealership. The car started responding better and does not stall in the mountains anymore.

If an authorized MB dealer cannot fix that simple of a problem I am not buying MB again. I work in Germany and my company cars are BMWs. Not one problem in 7 years!

P.S. I just noticed that the dealership posted a response to the review on Google asking me to talk to their GM.  If they really wanted to talk to me they could easily call me - my phone is in their files.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I met with Linh Mong at the dealership for my new CLA250. He was extremely helpful with providing me information about the cars with different packages available in the inventory. He walked me through all of them based on my preferences and made it easy for me to choose one. Linh was very responsive and helped me sign a great deal.< /Text>

We worked with Kamal and Goran with the purchase of a GL450 to accommodate our growing family. Our experience was above and beyond what we had expected. They were extremely personable, professional, and easy to work with.

My husband and I couldn't be happier with the experience. We're happy to be a part of the Mercedes family and when we're ready to upgrade my husbands car we will definitely come back to work with them.< /text>

I brought the vehicle I work with into the service department for my appointment for the 2nd service package and a smell of gas. You would have thought a smell of gas coming from a 2016 vehicle would have warranted some priority. Nope! Never the less my vehicle was disregarded despite my appointment. They kept my vehicle there the entire day and ended up just calling me at the end of the day saying they did not even touch or look at my vehicle. Why not tell me earlier!? I wasted my entire work day not making any money while my car was supposed to be service and paid out of pocket for Uber multiple times for vain. They are always over booked, no loaner vehicles, no availability for appointments or regard for emergency service such as a smell of gas.
I do not recommend this location of Mercedes at all, not even for sales which I had just as an horrible experience buying the vehicle from this location as well.
The constant lies, the false promises, the lack of communication, and total disregard for my time has made me never want to come to this location because it happened every single time. I took a few days before posting this review bc I wanted to give the manager a chance to call me to resolve but no one has contacted me so since this location as zero customer service and seems to not care, I will be making a formal complaint to corporate. Maybe then they will appreciate their customers.</Text>

I agree with other reviewers complaining about their bad experiences. Experience with sales team was terrible, especially David - plain rude. Asked to check a show car, I think it was GTC, which refused to unlock and said he can’t unlock it. How do you expect someone to buy it from a dealership that doesn’t want you to see the interiors? I’m going to buy a Mercedes by end of 2018 for sure, but definitely NOT buying it from these guys.</Review>

Excellent service as usual from John Stansbury!  Everything is taken care of within 2 hours, and even my car battery was replaced free of charge (with extra batteries left for my next time).  These are the little touches that makes Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek my favorite place to purchase and service my car.</review>

My advisor, Felix, was very helpful.   I couldn't be happier with the service.  Felix was very courteous, kept me informed by clearly explaining things, and followed-up at just the right frequency.

Felix, AutoNation and Mercedes of North America helped me with a major engine repair that happened outside of the warranty period.   I am glad that I purchased a certified pre-owned from this dealership.</review>

I would like to take this opportunity to say that I had a fantastic experience for repair services of my 2020 GLE at the Mercedes-Benz of Steve Creek and the excellent support received from my service advisor Susan Sulimani.

My car needed multiple repairs and seemed to have complicated battery/software issues, however Susan explained the technical issues in a super clear and upfront way and kept me constantly posted throughout the repair process. She is highly courteous, knowledgable, and precise in every conversation and does not miss any details from the moment I dropped off my car until I picked up the car. After repairs she also made sure to reach out and check on the car condition and my satisfactions with the whole experience, which was fantastic.

Susan totally earns my business and I am very pleased for knowing her and I would certainly recommend her as the service advisor to work with at Mercedes-Benz of Steven Creeks.

Other staffs were also super professional and helpful in every step of the way.

Best Regards,< /Review>

My lovely wife and I was looking to purchase the new 2013 ML350 so we went to Smythe European.  The Sales Associate, Omar Awwad, was very helpful in helping find the perfect ML350, White Diamond Metallic (very rare) with all the features that we wanted.  Omar's customer services was superb!  He spend his time explaining the full features of the ML350 that we wanted.  Omar also help us get the best APR and price for us to finance the vehicle.  Thank you Omar for you outstanding customer services!!! I would highly recommend anyone who wishes to buy a Mercedes-Benz, go to Smythe European and ask for Omar Awwad.  You won't be disappointed!!< /Review>

I made this appointment on 4/26/18 because the other 2 Mercedes dealerships in South San Jose and in Monterey do not work on Mercedes RV, and we live 45 miles away from the Stevens Creek dealership, in Watsonvile, California.
While I was taken in right away by Felix Alvarez , he rushed me through and had me set up right away but I was never asked if I wanted a hard copy of my estimate but sent a e-mail instead. I looked for the e-mail but it had not arrived when I received a call from my wife, we are both Seniors, and on fixed incomes. She was questioning why we are paying so much and wanted a breakdown of the charges, since I did not have the e-mail invoice of the charges I went to Felix desk and looked at my invoice while explaining to my wife and meantime Felix arrives after a few seconds and says in his normal tone of voice “YOU IN TROUBLE NOW” and asked me if I wanted to take the invoice to the customer waiting area. My wife hears this and goes ballistic over the phone, I told Felix don’t say anything she can hear you. I then returned to my chair. When I finally saw the e-mail of the estimate it stated that I had not requested shard copy of the estimated costs with a check mark on the location where it asked.

After 15 minutes Felix was walking by and I told Felix I wanted to bring my business to this dealership because of the excellent reputation I had heard from friends who own Mercedes cars, and it is bad enough my wife and her mechanic son did not want me to bring it here because of the expensive bill, Felix told me he had a customer and went outside.

Upon his return I approached his desk the for future reference/advice not to make any comments while a customer is talking on his personal cell phone it is BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE , Felix told me that I was at his work station and I should not be looking at other service orders, I told him I was looking at my own service order and that the service orders should not be left out in the open desk area where it is open on two sides and went back to my chair. This happened at 10:40am and I expected an apology but none came during this time period I overheard comments from an advisor named Susan of This is a nice customer while she introduced another customer to Felix and what’s up with these customers. Well has a former customer service representative for the Postal Service and retired union officer I expected better customer service. But since I did not go for the   Expensive Service, but partial services to save money. Two things 1. Less said is best when overhearing customers personal calls 2. Do not keep customers private information on top of the desk hard copy or not where all non-essential people see and look at them. Customer personal information is to be safeguarded to prevent identity theft or worse a stalking situation.
At 11:40 am today 5/15/18 ,On the other hand I was deeply dissatisfied and disappointed when I found out the Tanaka air bag part under recall ordered 4/26/2018 was not installed because they are having difficulty in getting the air bag parts and they knew ahead of time, now Mr Alvarez was apologizing and turned out to be not at fault for this matter but talked to the manager and gave me a 5% discount and another $100 off my original estimate . Parts or the Service department dropped the ball, now when we travel we have to worry about both Tanaka air bags being a dangerous menace to us while we jaunt around the USA, Canada and Mexico<//text>

My overall experience was very smooth and efficient. Rasty Kuruc was great. He made sure that I was taken care of all the way, in and out. Probably my best experience as far taking the car to any dealer in the last 2 decades!! Service matters!!<//review>

Well...
First of all it'a beautiful place ...very cleane with all the employees very helpful and friendly...verywell informed ...a very good customer service.
You really can feel comfortable there even if you have to wait for a while to get your car.
Now...when I got there, I parked ny car and right away I got an agent asking me if I need any help...
We start seeing cars...until I saw the one I wanted...he brought the keys and came with me to try it.
Coming back we met an other very nice agent who explained to me evrything about the car...and answered all my inquieries...
He explained to me all the ways possibles to buy the car and the benefits about the garanties...etc
Then I met the financial to close the deal...Mozi was so helpful...
I signed my contract ..they cleaned my car and full it of ⛽ and I left with my new Mercedes that I love....
Very satisfied in all the senses.
Thank you Mercedes.
Thank you Autonation<//Review>

<Text>I bought the GLE 2016 from Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek few weeks ago.
I was working with Mark and he was very nice and reasonable dealer.
Before I visited, I communicated with him via email and could negotiated the price. When I visited him, everything is just like what I was expecting.
He is following up my experience with new vehicle and giving me the answers of any questions. I really recommend this dealer-shop and Mark to anyone who want to buy mercedes and you will have pleasure experience.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>I bought a 2013 certified pre-owned C250, and the buying experience was excellent: I went there for test driving 3 times and tested out several cars each time. Goran, the salesman, was very patient and never pushy, and he gave me his fair opinion about the pros and cons for each of them. After the purchase, he took the time to explain me all the features and helped me set up the bluetooth connection, and he showed me around the service department. I am very happy with the buying experience and the car, I would certainly go there again!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

He even called me for some cosmetic repair/fix that can be claimed by warranty (for free) before it's expired. I would really recommend Troy, he deserves 5 stars and is the only reason I keep going back to MB Stevens Creek.

Loaner car wise, there is this reception person who is not so friendly and with an arrogant attitude. -1 star on the loaner car reception person. He is probably the most senior person on that desk, that's why he acts that way.
The first loaner car I got had an error message so I had to retrun for another one. Interior was also like previous driver took it to a road trip to Grand Canyon or something... But it's free and only for 1 day, I should not be complaining.</review>< Pictures>

I purchased a used 350GLK and included a maintenance and windshield coverage.  A year later I tried unsuccessfully to get the windshield fixed/replaced, dealing with the insurance carrier.  I spoke to the vendor for the windshield several times and nothing happened.  I left a message with the used car sales department at Mercedes of Stevens Creek and within hours the General Manager straightened the whole thing out and I had the windshield replaced!  This dealership not only gives stellar service they support their customers with obstacles beyond their dealership.  I highly recommend them.< /Text>

A good experience for me to lease C300 here with Jorainna. She is very nice and explains different packages and detailed features of C-class and CLA to me. I compared the price from San Jose Benz, Fremont Benz, Stevens Creek and Stevens Creek gave me a really big promotion.</text>

<Text>Based of first time call in, person who answers lacks knowledge.  Incompetent.

I ask for pricing on oil change as well as checking the car (like 4 point inspection). I admit I am not familiar with Service A B and C tiers but the person who picked up threw them all at me like a script.
I then just asked for pricing on just the oil change and she gave me a price.  I asked how come it’s priced that much and her response was, “I don’t know. I just work here.  The prices are set the way they are.”   Being shocked at this answer, I repeated what she said and I followed up with a “Good bye”.

How bad was that?!?  What’s worse was I was getting service next door with my wife’s Volkswagen all this time and I asked the service guy the same question about Mercedes pricing.  And that made me worth considering coughing up the price.   Lol.  He’s answer, “paying for quality, labor, and it’s standard pricing for them as they are using OEM.”  Mentioned that Mercedes Benz are efficient and their technicians get paid more so you’re gonna have to pay more even if it’s for an oil change.

A+ for VW!!! Haha.  They even said they can do my oil change but and better rate + parts.

Front of the house, you people with class and excellent customer relations.  I’m sure this person was from “the block.”

(Noticed that everyone posts here for the service side of the business as well even though there’s a separate business entity on Google.  So I post here to follow suit.)</Text>< pictures>

James Duffer and the service department made an initial mis-diagnosis on my ML430.

When the car stalled and wouldn't start the next day, they took it back and serviced it at no-cost to make good on their initial repair.

Love to see mechanics stand by their work.<//review>

I reside out of state and after seeing a van on the internet I contacted Shawn Abtahi a Salesman at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek. Shawn promptly returned my phone calls and seeing that we were very serious about purchasing this Ram ProMaster which was sight unseen, he worked very closely with us to ensure that the van was delivered safely and in a timely manner. The process of purchasing from out of state with MB of Stevens Creek was much easier, smoother and uncomplicated. I would highly recommend not to be worried if you do purchase from them and are out of state. Shawn will take very good care of you and we are very happy and excited to have such a fine vehicle and that the pictures did not do it justice. Thank you MB of Stevens Creek!<//Review>

<user_name>Ron Emilio< /user_name><gmap_id>0x808fca855c879807:0xa6eb059ea5b89798< /gmap_id><text>Because I ordered a 2018 SL550 in July of 2017, there was a bit of a wait. Storms at sea also contributed to a bit of a delay. Despite these factors, I received my SL550 in November exactly as I had ordered it. I absolutely love the car.

My sales rep, Dusan, was there the entire time to guide me and to answer all my questions. He made the process of buying my car so simple. I'd use him again should I buy another Mercedes. Everyone from the receptionist, to the parts department, to the finance people, to the technicians who helped me learn how to operate the car were accessible and friendly and extremely helpful.

If I was asked if I would recommend this dealership to someone interested in buying a Mercedes, my answer would be a resounding "YES".

Thanks to you all.

02/01/19
On 01/28/19 I brought my SL550 in for it's first service(only 2242 miles but tired of seeing the reminder on dash). It should have taken only a part of one day to complete the job. I got a call from my service advisor that during the wiper replacement, the tech cracked the windshield. I was told that the glass had to come from the East coast so it would take 5 to 7 business days to arrive. That is where I am at this time...waiting. I DO have a loaner, however.

Very good service and excellent detailing (the latter was free).  I just wish Mercedes did not have an automatic message announcing the need for another service--even if you do not need one.<//text>

Short of loaners, I was out of luck. Asked them to do some additional service but got "we can't do it because it's Saturday". A follow-up tires upsell attempt sounded pathetic after that. I don't know, I expected more from mercedes.<//review>

Not a good experience. While picking up the car, I had to wait for 45 minutes, because they couldn't find the car, and even when they did, they couldn't find the spare keys I had given for battery change. Lastly I asked them to charge my car, so that I can reach home. But they didn't. Not a very happy camper at all.< /Text>

<Text>I was lucky to have met Slava, who took a direct, no-frills approach to presenting the car (my first MB, a 2016 C300). Between arriving at the dealership and a test drive, hardly 30 minutes had passed, and I already knew everything I needed about the car. Slava was extremely thorough, and was nice enough to follow me home on his own car to gather a few signatures from the wife. Great experience.< /Text>< pics>

I have been there to buy my new car and Kristoff was the sales person who assisted me. I have got a really great deal and the customer service is true to perfection. They are very friendly and helpful in explaining each and every detail of the car, showing us all the available models for selection. After I bought the vehicel, they also gifted me multiple items as token of appreciation.

One thing for sure: The better you negotiate, the better deal you get.</Review>

We set up a convenient time to stop by and test drive it, and decided to purchase it.  AutoNation has a set price policy with their used cars, and it was a fair price, so no haggling was necessary.

I had seen the car online. I had price in mind. Negotiations were simple. Sales man did not know the features of the car.   After I bought the car, I noticed dent in the front bumper. Gretchen, Sales Manager, took care of it for free. Great service. However, I decided to cancel the maintenance plan and auto warranty and sent them written notice. Finance Manager forgot to cancel. He told me (at the time of signing loan docs) that it takes 3 months for the lender to credit the amount once I cancel it. So, I waited for 3 months. No refund was issued. They did not send payment back to lender. I called again. Finance manager admitted his mistake  and then cancelled hte contract. I ended up paying extra interest. I asked for some sort of discount or credit for any service or parts. He flatly refused. If I were him, I would have given some discount on services to retain customer.</Review>

I leased a new GLS450 from Stevens Creek. The leasing experience was super with Slava Aprelenko who took care of our requirements and was very prompt in responding to any questions. I also got my first servicing done here and the scheduling process was super smooth with great availability and prompt service. Car was in and out the same day. Troy was great as he took care of cleaning the car after the service.</text>

Horrific experience there, they look at you like they have never seen a coloured person before. And to think I was going to order my AMG from these guys!

The receptionists at the service department ignore you and act like your not there, once they do notice you they are so rude!

Need some educating on the fact that there are Asian people in their small stuck up world and that we can afford to buy AMG’s. Unbelievable.</review>

Excellent experience having my '96 C280 A serviced, front disc brakes and rotors replaced, and two new tires with 4 wheel balance.  My first experience with Charlie Fish who replaced the retired Ford Coggelton as my service advisor and I am completely satisfied.  Charlie was very thorough and knew what he was doing! RGS<//text>

I would like to take this opportunity to say that I had a fantastic experience for repair services of my 2020 GLE at the Mercedes-Benz of Steve Creek and the excellent support received from my service advisor Susan Sulimani.

My car needed multiple repairs and seemed to have complicated battery/software issues, however Susan explained the technical issues in a super clear and upfront way and kept me constantly posted throughout the repair process. She is highly courteous, knowledgable, and precise in every conversation and does not miss any details from the moment I dropped off my car until I picked up the car. After repairs she also made sure to reach out and check on the car condition and my satisfactions with the whole experience, which was fantastic.

Susan totally earns my business and I am very pleased for knowing her and I would certainly recommend her as the service advisor to work with at Mercedes-Benz of Steven Creeks.

Other staffs were also super professional and helpful in every step of the way.

Best Regards,< /Text>

Despite the fact they did not have the exact car I wanted, they searched for it nationwide and delivered it here so I can get touch and feel and make a final decision.
The whole process is pressure-free and very accommodating.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Not a great first customer experience here.  Positive feedback for giving me a loaner car.  But poor on customer communication and timing.  I brought the car in first thing on a Friday morning so it could be taken care of that day, and apparently no one even worked on it that Friday (so why did I get up at 7am to bring it in?)  Did not get a status call.  By end of the day I called, and finally did get a call back with a non-committal response ("Well it might be taken care of Monday, not sure, we will get back to you").  Furthermore the service rep handling my situation said "I am out Monday, so we will get back to you Tuesday", implying that the car couldn't/wouldn't be worked on well he was out.  Anyway I sent a somewhat pushy email saying that I needed the car by end of the day Monday so I could take it on a road trip (which was true).  In the end they did fix it and I got it Monday afternoon, but it wasn't a great customer experience because of how long it took and the poor communication process.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1471284934401, 'text': "Hi Russell, thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

<Text>It was very quick and easy shopping experience. We took a test drive, selected a car and finalized a price with minimum haggling. We returned our  lease and drove the new car out same day in less than 4 hrs. Very efficient and courteous. Enjoyed working with manager Samir and Sales Personnel Junruo Yao.. She was very nice and gave small gift. Had wonderful experience.< /Text>< rate>

These guys are very professional and very helpful. They helped me throughout car selection and buying process.

Steve Fang was our initial contact. We had very specific requirement and he kept watch on inventory and informed us as soon as he spotted E350 we had in our mind.

Throughout our buying process Jas Singh & his manager helped me a lot. Jas's manager helped me to get great APR rate. He suggested different warranty /protection is best for me. And also helped me to decide which protection is not necessary to me.

If you want to have wonderful car buying / leasing experience I would suggest this location.   Thanks, Santosh< /text>

< Review>
From my experience this actually seems like a really good shop and i'm a big skeptic when it comes to auto sales esp. for luxury brands. They offered me a very reasonable price, the sales person was knowledgeable and not pushy and just a nice guy. They went an extra mile to follow up on the purchase even after the deal was closed. I think the reason is they are a really high volume shop so they don't have to mark up their cars much and they actually value their customers and reputation more than quick profit. There are some shops that seem to have cash'n'run mentality but this isn't one of them and it's refreshing. (My sales person was Shawn). As a bonus they do have some gorgeous cars on the floor so there's always something to gawk at while in the lobby :)< /Review>

< Review>
Recently, I joined the Mercedes-Benz family. I was incredibly impressed with the service I received from every person at the dealership. My salesman, Vo, was kind, patient, and grateful. He was eager to please, but not pushy - perfect fit for the type of customer that I am. My next interaction was with the GSM, Stan. He was professional, a straight-shooter and there were no games involved. Lastly, I sat down with Joseph in Finance. Joseph was very personable and knowledgable. He listened to my needs and "not necessaries" and was able to suggest packages accordingly. On my way out, I received handshakes from all involved with my purchase. This was a seamless afternoon. I highly recommend Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek. Thanks, guys!

P.S. I LOVE MY CAR!!!< /Review>

I went to the place at 3/24 at firstly, and looking for a C300, not decided to buy a new car or a CPO car or lease a one at that time. Jerald (hope I remember the correct name) talked to me first, then it is Jorainna who handle all my subsequent purchase process.  It is easy for me to discuss with Jorainna in Chinese. Anyway, both of them are really nice.
Finally I decided to lease a white 2018 C300, but on that day  the quote is not attracting (approximately ~20K for 36months in total), so I held off and Jorainna  suggest me ask quote at the end of each Quarter, when they might have a better deal.
On 3/31, the last day of Quarter 1, and that is a Saturday, Jorainna called me saying there is new quote, and when I see the message, It is really a good discount (1500 downpayment with 36monthly ~400. I choose some additional services like 3-year maintainance, lease protection etc., finally it is ~484 monthly). I went to there at 1pm, test drive, run my credit, finance, and took my car home!
The only thing they can make it better is the process time. It takes me ~4 hours to finish to whole process. But since it is a busy day and good quote and good service from Jorainna and the finance guy (Razawi), it is reasonable and acceptable.
So to the conclusion, I am pretty satisfied.This is my first Mercedes car, hope everything going well in the following 3 years. :)< /Review>

My husband and I bought a used Toyota Tacoma.  We found it via AutoNation, and Mercedes-Benz was very responsive with respect to my many questions about the truck, and sent me a great electronic information package with all the particulars.  We set up a convenient time to stop by and test drive it, and decided to purchase it.  AutoNation has a set price policy with their used cars, and it was a fair price, so no haggling was necessary.  BUT, we had to wait over two hours just to write a check and get all the transfer paperwork signed.  Two hours to pay cash is no bueno.< /Review>

<Text>These guys are very professional and very helpful. They helped me throughout car selection and buying process.

Steve Fang was our initial contact. We had very specific requirement and he kept watch on inventory and informed us as soon as he spotted E350 we had in our mind.

Throughout our buying process Jas Singh & his manager helped me a lot. Jas's manager helped me to get great APR rate. He suggested different warranty /protection is best for me. And also helped me to decide which protection is not necessary to me.

If you want to have wonderful car buying / leasing experience I would suggest this location.   Thanks, Santosh<//Text><Date>1483081711489</Date>< Response>

Took my 2015 gl 350 with a "loud squeaking sound when braking" issue over 5 weeks back. Was told that it was a know issue with the model and that the replacement part was back ordered for 3-4 weeks. It's been 5 weeks and haven't heard back. Left messages for the service rep for an update on the status but haven't heard back. Not the kind of service one would expect from a Mercedes dealer.
I guess a gl 350 squeaking around all over the Bay Area is a great advertisement for the brand!< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>As young parents 28 years ago, we came to your dealership to buy our first Mercedes Benz.  Last weekend, history came full-circle as our son choose to make his 1st car purchase at Stevens Creek!  Son researched and test drove different options through the Bay Area but the BEST choice came down to Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek...specifically working with Mark Arnold.

Internet Sales Consultant Mark Arnold patiently listened to requirements before presenting matched options to choose from.  With a laid back approach, Mark groomed a young, first time buyer to fully understand car features, functions and financing options. Once Sales Manager Samir Karimi joined in, there was absolute confidence going into the purchase of the new 2016 CLA!  What could have been potentially nerve racking turned out to be very positive and successful.

Thank you Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek and Mark Arnold for the extraordinary experience!  Continuing with tradition, we strongly recommend this dealership and staff!  Go see for yourself, ask for Mark!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Horrible service when buying a car. My dad and I walked into buy a replacement mercedes after our original one was totalled. When they asked for my dad's credit which he answered truthfully to the agent we were working with told us not to lie. We told them we were honest about the credit and the his boss gave us a really overpriced deal (like 20% more than my friend who walked in the day before for the same car+options) I'm not sure if it was just because we were indians but honestly we just got up and got out of there. On our ride back home we went onto tesla and ordered our car there. Honestly you don't have to deal with their price tactics and disrespect, Tesla labels their price and my experience with them has been amazing< /review>

I recently purchased a 2011 MINI Cooper from Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek. I live in Palm Springs and made the entire transaction over the phone and via email.

Being a 30 year veteran of the Automobile Business, I am not usually WOWED...But I must say...I'M WOWED!

Sales Manager, Samir Karimi handled the transaction with seamless professionalism in making this one of the most pleasant car buying experiences ever.

I wholeheartedly endorse this dealership and recommend speaking with Samir.</Review>

Had a good experience here the last time round...no such luck this time. Everything started out smoothly - we ran my credit for a three year lease, found a car that worked for me in SoCal at which point I shook hands with the manager (PJ) and paid the deposit with the understanding that I had a deal which we would finalize upon pickup. The car arrived at the dealership a few days later, at which point I was told that my credit (which had been run when I made the deposit) was in fact NOT sufficient and the deal was off. To top it off, nearly two months later my DEPOSIT IS STILL MIA, no refund and no explanation despite dozens of calls and unanswered messages.

What should have been a simple pain free (maybe fun?) interaction has dragged into a months long annoyance. MB dealers are usually a pleasure to deal with and my last purchase here was a great one, not sure what to chalk this up to...maybe the new ownership?< /text>

Decided to head to Mercedes of Stevens Creek when my water pump decided to kick the bucket. Service department managed to fit me in next-day after they had an opening come up. Worked with Jay Falkner my service rep to get the GL back on the road. Jay really was knowledgable and helped out with all of our questions. Service was a bit pricey on the water pump replacement but i guess thats what i get for driving a fine piece of German engineering :(.  Overall we really had a great experience!!< /text>

< Review>
I purchased a new Mercedes Benz CLA from Smythe European. The process was seamless despite the fact that had an evening appointment after work, tired and hungry in the middle of the week. Omar and the entire team worked with me, took my trade in and by the end of the night I was on my way home with the CLA I wanted.</Review>

< Review>
Untrustable dealership. I had filled and signed several documents to confirm the price agreed by me and the dealer. Then they told me they didn't have the vehicle but they could get it from another dealership... After that I waited and waited, had called them for many times. The seller only picked up 30% calls from me and always said the manager was busy or the guys in another dealership were busy. After 3days waiting and 5times trusting on their promises... They finally told me it was not possible to get that car. I really need a car or otherwise I would spend too much money on uber (I live in Palo Alto, expensive uber area).
Hope more people can see my experience and make a better choice.<//Review>

<review>Great service at this dealership, and especially by Danesh Dhiasi. He has been in the car business for a while and knows many comparable features of different luxury cars. His knowledge and friendliness were impressive.  We appreciated the fact that there was no high pressure sales approach.  In fact, it was exciting to see all the new luxury models and all the features and Danesh helped us stay focused on the model with features we need (and can afford!).

Thank you!</review><response>None</response>< Rate>

<text>There was nothing remarkable about the service or experience at all. Omar in accounting/finance was cordial and direct, which I did appreciate (however). Although I did not feel any sales pressure, I also did not feel like anyone was trying to win my business either. Also, after driving a considerable distance (almost 400 miles) to view the car, I was kind of disappointed with how I was greeted upon arrival. Once I had the keys in hand, nobody even offered to assist me with any initial set up (audio, bluetooth or key vehicle functions).  The most helpful person I encountered while at the dealership was actually an on-sight vehicle photographer (NOT employed by Mercedes-Benz) who was happy to help me set up my Bluetooth (after nobody came out to assist me).   The car detail they performed upon purchase was also sub-par. The dash was dusty and there were smear marks all over the navigation unit. Overall, the experience was definitely sub-par to what I would have anticipated it be and ultimately would not recommend their quality of service.</text>< pics>

Bought our second vehicle from the new Stevens Creek Mercedes, (formerly Smythe) now a part of Auto Nation.  Goran was our salesman, and was very knowledgefull of our brand new model ML400.  These new vehicles are high-tech wonders and require assistance to explain their functionality, and Goran breezed through it.  The pre-sale ordering, the delivery and the sale was done with personal professionalism, and we never felt uncomfortable throughout the process.  We were even introduced to our own service adviser for our upcoming services.  Goran has since called me several times to make sure everything was to my satisfaction and understanding.  If you are going to buy a high-end vehicle in the Bay area, I recommend Stevens Creek Mercedes Benz.  No fuss...no muss.<//review>

I bought ML350 for my wife about a week ago. Frank (Farbod Homayoun) has been extremely helpful through the process. He was very patient and detailed oriented. After we finished our paper work, it was almost 8 clock. He even helped to drive our car to our home.

The gentleman helped my financial work (Mr. Vo maybe) was also very nice, and very familiar with the process. He answered every of my questions right on point.

I also saw the general manager in this place. He was very kind, professional and called my last name correctly when I left.

Everyone there seems super nice, and right on top of the best service.

If I buy my second car, I will go there again.

Thanks Frank and all for the great help! My wife loves the car.</Review>

< Review>
I have been a customer of MB Stevens Creek since 2007.  The relationship we've established with this dealership played an important role in our recent decision to stay with a Mercedes product and return to MB of Stevens Creek when we decided to move from a sedan to an SUV.

We drove several suv's, but when we finally decided to try the ML350, I didn't want the test drive to end.

Our main reason for recommending MB Stevens Creek is the service department.  After our first purchase in '07, we were assigned a service adviser.  We were lucky enough to be assigned to Troy Shalk and insisted we stay with him upon our most recent purchase.  It's actually a pleasure to deal with Troy and the entire MBSC staff.  Troy knows our vehicle, he knows us, and we are treated like very valued clients.  It's almost like treating our car to a spa day.  Work is completed thoroughly, the car is returned clean, and we've never had to return for re-work.  Their driveway technician program is great way to have minor issues or questions quickly resolved.

One time after we had been away for a couple of weeks and returned home to find our MB dead electrically, a tow truck was promptly dispatched to our home to pick up the vehicle and take it in for repair.  The problem was quickly diagnosed and resolved, and the entire electrical system was thoroughly tested to make sure no other issues would crop up.

We have other vehicles and deal with other dealerships.  MB Stevens Creek should be teaching seminars on how to treat customers and their vehicles.<//Review>

I'd put higher stars just for the actual sales service but had to drastically reduce stars for quality assurance & post-sale service. Bought a 2 year old pre-certified. But then 3 days after driving the vehicle out of the dealership the air conditioner breaks :( Wasn't the vehicle thoroughly inspected before they mark it ready for sale & pre-certified!? And then found out I have to wait 7 days before their Service Centre can inspect the issue & claim the repair under warranty...double disappointment!!  Apparently I called just hours too late (within their buyer return policy) in reporting the problem so have to go through repair &, potentially, warranty claim. Hope they improve on their quality assurance & customer relationship management, otherwise they'll lose out on potential returning customers.< /text>

I just purchased a certified pre owned 2010 E350 with Omar Awaad as the salesman-he was great in explaining the details of the car to me and I have had it about a week now and I am extremely happy with it and going through the sales routine was much more pleasant than I anticipated.
Everyone there that I dealt with new what they were doing and were pleasant to deal with.</Text>

<Text>Service department review:  Be carful when you think about getting your service done here. Jesus so much attitude, arrogant Behavior on Saturday morning! Wasted my entire day! I am just writing review right after talking to service adviser Joseph Tipton. (I literally pulled over so that I can write the review with the same fustration I had when I was talking to him). At the end of routine service talk, I told him please make sure the car is washed properly. Joseph said we only do machine  wash and there might be possible to see some spots and all after the service since they don't do hand car wash. He added we do vacuum only on the front seats. Not back seats, not trunk. No air no vacuum basically. Whats the point doing just front seats if your not cleaning the car fully. (to be honest never heard anything like this before in my 5 years of MB ownership). They should take cleaning 101 classes., I mean seriously!

it may be silly  but Upon asked he said it's their policy... that's what triggered my fuse in the brain! I told him that's not fair. It's freaking Mercedes Benz service station and you guys don't even do car wash! That's awful service practice. I told him I wanna see manager to discuss this further and also the policy where it shows they don't do car wash inside out with full vacum and air. He said they don't have any managers available in the entire facility( it's Saturday so). He didn't even show me any policy either. He added it's just thats how we do it. I am like dude let me straight get the hell outa here. I picked up managers business cards and happily walked out of there. No way I am going back but would definitely like to file a formal complain about it. And would like to see someone who decides all these malpractice get back to me with some valid explanation on their practice/policies.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

When I bought a new GL450 in July 2014 dealer swore by best in class service (courtesy vehicle etc.).  Not so much in reality.  Recently had trouble with the cooling system and car had to be towed to the dealership around 10am.  I asked for courtesy vehicle and was told none are available.  Rented a car and awaited for a call.  None came so I called my service advisor at 4pm to enquire about status but he did not know.  Called again the next day and was told car will be ready for pick up at noon.  On the positive side, car got fixed in 48hrs and they also cleaned it.  That said, they do not deliver on the promises they make when you buy the car and communication needs to improve.< /text>

< Review>
Recently purchased a GLK 350 from MB of Stevens Creek with my fiance.  Can't commend the sales staff highly enough. I work in enterprise sales so I was prepared for the stereotypical car sales approach however our experience could not have been better.  Dealt with Manny Chua who was a consummate professional who constantly addressed our needs and concerns without applying the slightest bit of pressure.  Would thoroughly recommend them, and Manny in particular.<//Review>

<Text>We recently bought a new C250 from Smythe European and got a great buying experience. Anmar Kamil listened carefully and asked the right questions in order to be able to show us some cars in stock that matched our request. We didn't come to buy right away but thanks to Anmar, we got a great car for a great price that day. On the delivery day, he took time to explain in detail all features and options, and he even configured the display and voice command to use our native language (french).

I will also bring my newly acquired car there for servicing; they always took good care of my old 2006 C230.

Next time we will shop for a new car, we will definitely come back!<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

I've been a customer at MB Stevens Creek way back when it was Smythe...Excellent service and adherence to MB standards .

Great sales team, finance and the dealership delivers quality autos new and CPO with 5 star + service department. They are the real deal and anyone interested in a MB whether it’s a CLA or S 560 you’re treating equally well!!! Wouldn’t go anywhere else. Tony Chiem is also one of the best sales associates to work with as is Sofi as a manager.</review>

We leased a brand new 2018 GLC coupe at Stevens Creek Mercedes. This is the second car we leased from this dealership. This place has a huge and clean showroom, lots of selections, and the best prices. All staff at this dealership are very friendly and polite. Charlie Shen, our sales rep, is AWESOME! He is very knowledgable and helpful. With his assistance, we were able to quickly identify and locate this beautiful car! Charlie got us a very very good deal. The entire leasing process was short and pleasant! I definitely recommend this dealership and Charlie Shen! 👍👍👍👍👍<//Text>

We went there to test drive GLC, then the salesman was aware that we had already test driven GLC from another showroom in San jose.(During our first test drive,we felt jerking at the rear seat that is the reason we decided to test drive again.) His attitude was rude .He was asking questions like Are you serious about buying, what is it that you want to check by test driving it again?
Come on.If a customer is not serious about buying, why should he take an appointment and come back to test the same vehicle again.In Fact thats the indicator that the customer has some interest in that vehicle and is serious about buying it.Anybody who is going to spend 40K has to think twice and rule out his doubts before before buying such expensive car.
We did not ask for numbers, even before that the salesman's attitude was wrong. We were annoyed by this wrong approach. You lost a sale.< /text>

I have been a customer of MB Stevens Creek since 2007.  The relationship we've established with this dealership played an important role in our recent decision to stay with a Mercedes product and return to MB of Stevens Creek when we decided to move from a sedan to an SUV.

We drove several suv's, but when we finally decided to try the ML350, I didn't want the test drive to end.

Our main reason for recommending MB Stevens Creek is the service department.  After our first purchase in '07, we were assigned a service adviser.  We were lucky enough to be assigned to Troy Shalk and insisted we stay with him upon our most recent purchase.  It's actually a pleasure to deal with Troy and the entire MBSC staff.  Troy knows our vehicle, he knows us, and we are treated like very valued clients.  It's almost like treating our car to a spa day.  Work is completed thoroughly, the car is returned clean, and we've never had to return for re-work.  Their driveway technician program is great way to have minor issues or questions quickly resolved.

One time after we had been away for a couple of weeks and returned home to find our MB dead electrically, a tow truck was promptly dispatched to our home to pick up the vehicle and take it in for repair.  The problem was quickly diagnosed and resolved, and the entire electrical system was thoroughly tested to make sure no other issues would crop up.

We have other vehicles and deal with other dealerships.  MB Stevens Creek should be teaching seminars on how to treat customers and their vehicles.<//Text>

<Review>DON'T DO HERE UNLESS FORCED FOR WARRANTY WORK.

Took my car in for B Service, and "brake light not working" waning light on dash.

Approved other work, but took 6 days.  Waiting for parts. WHY SIX DAYS?????

Dealer replaced center brake light assembly including the circuit board, $400.

THE DEALER CHARGED ME OVER $400 FOR THE WRONG PARTS AND LABOR.
MY SL WAS SERVICED BY THEIR "B TEAM", THEY FAILED TO DIAGNOSE THE REAL PROBLEM,
AND DID NOT TEST THEIR WORK AFTER COMPLETED.  THE WARNING LIGHT IS TILL ON TODAY !!!!!!!!!
...AND WHEN RETURNED MY AIR CONDITIONING WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY.
WHAT DID THEY DO TO IT ??????

When I phoned and gave my invoice# to Mr. Fish, he started quoting me warranty policy.
Claiming the date was 2014, not last week. When he finally checked the invoice date, he got defensive,
and was always arrogant.  It quickly became my fault. Then he transferred me to a voice mail to schedule a second appointment.
Latter received a vmail asking what I wanted.  WHAT I WANTED??
THEY DON'T TALK TO ONE ANOTHER IN THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT ????</Review>< pictures>

I purchase a CLS 6.3 off the show room floor. It is a beautiful car and that is about it. The service has been good but I see wait times getting longer and longer. On my watch the car has been in the shop over 115 days or more. Two new engine blocks, two new intake manifolds and lots more. At purchase, I was not told about the modifications done to the car and getting the history was impossible. I also caught them lying on the CAR FAX. You see they are in bed with CarFAX. To prove it, I traded a 2005 Cayenne that had been in the shop 48 times for a front end issue Porsche could not fix. On the CARFAX, they reported normal service at Steven Creek Porsche. Today is 8/30/2015 and when I start the car is sounds like marbles are being crushed in the engine. Other failures are head lights, air ride, A/C and little things that just should not happen to a Mercedes. My friends are laughing at me and it hurts. Try to talk to Mercedes is like talking to a wall. It is funny how they love you as you buy. Once you drive out the door the car looses 50% in value. You can see the lack of interest on the reps face as you return. That look, is I can't get anymore money out of you so don't waist my time. Do you want one of these? Front brakes $3,500.00. Out of warranty , Intake manifold $just under $5,000.00. Now all new cams and the car came back with items not working and the engine light on.<//Text>

<Review>The people who work at the “front desk” gives you abhorrent unprofessional attitudes. As a paying customer who spent thousands on car maintenance, I do not appreciate to be treated with disrespect. Shame on you Mercedes Benz for not monitoring your dealerships, customers do take notice of this and yes it does affect the choices I make in the future when purchasing cars. Do yourself a favor- go to some other dealership where they care about customer service.</Review>< Time>

<Text>This is the worst dealership in the Bayv area . Please DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE. Starting from the Management in the Service Department all they care is to sell you, things that you, don't really need. I, have an SL-550 i took my vehicle there for a Convertible top issue, I paid about $2000.00 the technician that worked, on my vehicle left a loose panel loose, during time that i use my top, the panel came off and when i closed, the top it got cought with the hydraulic trunk area, which broke a cable, and now they want to charge me, $1370.00 dollars, i definitely think i, shouldn't be responsible, for the negligence of their technician, since they install the panel back together for my top. I , tried to explain the situation to the SERVICE MANAGER  and he seemed, to back up his technician , and said that everything he did was fine. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE STEVENCREEK MERCEDES BENZ DEALERSHIP! !!!!! The Worst Service Department in the Bay Area !!!

Jim and Stan are the best! They helped us throughout the entire process from A-Z. We looked around at other Mercedes dealerships, but when we visited MB of Stevens Creek the first car we looked at was the 2017 AMG GLE 43. The first of it available in Northern Cal in early Aug. 2016. We were the first to test drive the vehicle and just fell in love with at first site. We wanted something with more horsepower and more sporty then what we currently have and so the GLE 43 fit perfectly. The team stayed late into the night (2am) before we drove off the lot with our new car. We get a lot of onlookers and people take pictures when we park as many have never seen this model on the road before. Thanks to all at Mercedes! :)<//text>

<Review>Special thanks goes to Joe Tipton, a technician, and DeVon. Joe (& team) found two serious/major cracks in one wheel (was replaced) that would have caused an accident & injuries to whoever was driving my car (at the time).
It's one thing to do a good job, in a timely manner, but when the personnel at a dealership ensure a safe driving car to me (or my family), then these dealership people get my highest praises and should be recognized.
There's probably been "gushy" feedbacks before, but Joe, the tech., and DeVon deserves special thanks.

It's an excellent experience on purchasing my 2017 GLC from this dealership. Through AARP, I found this dealership. The internet sales manager Jorainna contacted me very courteously and professionally. In the process of ordering, waiting, delivering and learning, the whole team worked very nicely to make us very comfortable. I strongly recommend this dealership and will use it in the future.< /review>

We were finally ready to invest on our family car and Mercedes was no doubt our first preference. My wife and I approached Stevens Creek showroom and our experience was warm and great overall. We were helped by Giovanni Hernandez a great person to work with. Gio took his time and was patient with us throughout the deal - right from test drive, to review of different Cars. We landed with buying GLE 350 4Matic. I am really thankful to Gio and other staffs at the showroom for making our buying experience smooth, swift and memorable. I would always recommend to visit Stevens Creek for your Mercedes - as I am sure you would not be disappointed at all</Review>

The salesperson Jake made my car buying endeavour a pleasant and enjoyable one. I never felt that I was pressured into buying anything or that I was being ripped off by a sleazy salesman with greasy hair that smelled of pachouli oil!!! eeoww....i hate those types!

Yeah, i loathe used car salesman makes me feel that I am waltzing with the devil in the pale moonlight! Not that I ever did that; i just DON'T want to. ha!ha!

Anyway, if you are shopping a new Benz try this dealership and ask for Jake, you shan't be disappointed!

Cheers! happy driving! :)

I was not planning on purchasing a car immediately, but the selection was great. Majid Amjadi (sales associate) was patient and spent much time with me explaining details about a particular car I was interested in. Thanks to Majid, I ended up purchasing the car. The dealership atmosphere and personnel was friendly and attentive to all visitors. I say this with much regard for other types of dealerships I visited did not even take the time to come out and talk with me. I highly recommend taking the time to visit Smythe European dealership.<//Review>

If I could put less then one star I would.. Very poor customer service. I went to this location today and I was talking to a sales representative by name Jas and I was deciding between two cars ( it was my first time in mercedes) and I wanted to receive few different options. The representative was probably new and he always had to go to a manager to check on deals. After 30 min the manager by name Samir came in and told me "listen I won't go back and force with you. You first decide what car you want and after I'll talk to you" Truly I was shocked.. I never saw so rude associates. How can I decide what car I'll buy without seeing the full financial description. I will never go to this dealership again.< /review>

My service adviser Stephen Kirksey has been the reason that I used to go to Park Ave Motors at Palo Alto, I love Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek now because Stephen is there.  If you're new, ask for Stephen Kirksey, You'll have another level of service.<//Review>

< Review>
Bought GLC 300, our very first MB, at this dealership. Like the experience from the beginning to the end from internet quotation to vehicle delivery. The quotation came with a pretty good price. We all know we will negotiate the price at the dealership. But if you give me a completely BS quote - basically MSRP that I already know from the vehicle site - I will not walk into the dealership, thinking there will be too much to negotiate down. Some dealer doesn't even give any number with blah blah reasons.... The quotation from this dealership starts with some amount off the MSRP and this made me think it is seriously wants the business. I walked in with a lot of homework done. Negotiated a price that is reasonable to average buyers and I completed that negotiation in about 30 minutes and left without much frustration or tiresome that usually come from the car shopping experience.

Also like non-pushy sales persons there. No body likes to be pushed to buy an expensive car like MB.< /Review>

I went looking for a new car, was interested in the GLA250, Vo approached us quite timely and was more than happy to assist us, answering questions and taking us for a test drive. We weren't looking to purchase that day in particular however between Vo and Safi, they offered us a great deal and had the car I wanted in stock. We asked to have overnight to think about it and they were very accommodating, there was no pressure and made the whole process very easy and relaxed. We returned the next morning and drove home in my new car! And I love it! Thank you Vo and Safi, you were both great.</text>

The service was excellent; this survey needs work.  The survey is not easy to log into and not very intuitive.
Ask the usual questions and give us a chance to note any other problems.

<Review>I was evaluating different premium SUVs and finally the list came down to the GLS 450 or the Land Rover Range Rover. And when the final choice of GLS 450 was decided, the natural choice of dealer was that of Stevens Creek.
Previously I had looked around for the GLS at various dealers, but unfortunately none of them followed up or seriously wanted to finalize the deal.

I would like to thank Hovik and Jaspreet for giving a wonderful customer sales experience and helping me get the vehicle of my choice.<//Review>< Pics>

A week back we bought a MB C300 from MB of Stevens Creek and we are extremely satisfied in all aspects of our purchase and it truly a nice experience.  The people are very helpful and cordial and will go to the extreme to help the customers, apart from going to them for any of our future needs we will  also recommend this dealership to our friends.

Chithra & Mohan

I had been to Mercedes-Benz of Steven Creek for my C300 Service on 6th Jan., they did a very nice job and they even washed my car inside out and my car now looks like new.  My special thanks to my service advisor Mr John  Stansberry who is as always very helpful.  I will surely recommend them for all my friends and family.

Thanks and Keep up the good work guys.

My 2013 c63 needed its service done,  along with a few other issues I had.  Rasty was able to get my car booked into service,  get me a loaner car,  and send me on my way in less than an hour. (35ish minutes). They were able to knock the car out in 1 day only. Rasty kept me well informed throughout the entire process. Will definitely recommend anyone to Rasty and MBofSC!<//text>

<date>1492702889099< /date><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Thanks to our salesman Eddie Peregrino, this buying experience was the smoothest ever.  In our case, process wasn't a simple one.  We had our hearts set on a new car model that is in very short supply, Mercedes GLC300 4Matic.  Too new to be available used.  Our options were to take whatever was available now, or order a car and wait 3-4 months.  We had a lease-return (a 2014 ML350) to deal with also, so we were under pressure to find a replacement.  Eddie worked with us for 2 months.  Searching for the specific color/option combination we wanted, without luck.  For over a month nothing was available that was even close to what we wanted.  He was getting us ready to place an order, preparing our lease-return, giving us a test drive, etc.  Until 3 weeks ago, he found the perfect car on a ship headed to Los Angeles.  It wasn't even officially available yet, and was headed to another dealership somewhere in the West.  But Eddie managed to find it, have it rerouted to his dealership, monitored its progress, ensured no other salesman got their hands on it.  He called us up 1 week ago, said "your car is here".  Within 1 day, we had the keys in hand.  He worked with us on credit union financing, got us a couple breaks on returning our old car, got a discounted price and, overall, made it a very smooth experience.  Eddie is a great guy, very patient and very knowledgable.  He knows the ins and outs of the leasing process, advised us on the pro's and con's of lease versus purchase.  He is a true professional.  Never once tried to sell us something we didn't want.  Never went into the backroom keeping us waiting.  No bait-and-switch, paid attention to what we wanted.  Treated us well, and got us the exact car we wanted.  Thanks to Eddie, I'd gladly go back to this dealer again.  This is my 10th car and the easiest one I've ever bought.  Thanks Eddie!</Text>< Name>

Recently I bought a MB SUV at MBSC. We were immediately greeted by a well - experienced and knowledgeable sales person, Mr.  Danesh Ghiasi, who made our buying decision easy. Also I liked MBSC 's one price deal. I definitely recommend MBSC to others and will be back in the future.<//text>

Fun time picking up the first one and only launch edition of the C-Cabriolet in the Bay Area. I drove by MB of San Jose earlier to look at white S-Cabs but they only had matte white which was a deal breaker for the wife, too cool I guess.  She's also transitioning from an E-Wagon/S-Class and current SL and preferred something around the same size as her SL. I'm not sure I would've ever thought to order a car with red interior and a matching soft top but this car is simply beautiful. Shout out to Kamil & Kim at MB of Stevens Creek for taking a hobo on a bicycle seriously ;) This team made our whole experience at this old Smythe smooth and enjoyable. Thank You< /Review>

The most horrible 1. I got the car I wanted I didn't get any discount on it . when we had the deal going I told them that I would be buying the with a cashier's check issued by my bank so they told me that's fine and made me do a credit app still and told me that they will not run my credit but after 1 month I found out that this stupid dealership ran my credit without my knowledge and now I am trying to get a hold of the sales managers to get an answer but they are not answering their calls and also not responding to the voicemails I have left . I have tried to get a hold of so one at automation who can help me but they take the concern and nothing happens if it was up to me I will never do business with this cheating dealership or yet not even buy a car from any of the autonation group dealerships because I have not had this issue with mercedes Benz but also with lexus of Cerritos who are also liars.
Be ware do not do business with them at the end of the day they don't care how they make money .< /Text>

Ever since Beshoff and Smythe sold out to Autonation their quality and service is the worst I've ever experienced. Especially the fact that they sell luxury cars. This is my second mercedes and it makes me question if I should stay with this automaker..

When I was playing the numbers game they told me i couldnt get my exact 2015 c300 with amg package for under $400 a month. They claimed the minimum was $520. I researched around and Mercedes Benz of Beverly Hills got me the same car with more options I didnt even want for $368 per month. A $54,000 car that Autonation told me wasnt possible..Greedy ass corporation.

Moral of the story, Autonation is crap, they don't care about customers or making sure problems are fixed correctly and in a timely manner.I will most definitely never buy a car from them and am now considering driving out of my way to Belmont Autobahn Mercedes Dealer... 1 star for the new dealership tho..</Review>

< Review>
We recently bought a GLK350, which makes it our 3rd Mercedes. We traveled from Central Valley to Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek because of the great service we received in the past and once again they did not disappoint.

We spoke with Shawn Abtahi the day before on the phone and let him know what we were looking for.When we came the next day, he was all prepared and was professional and courteous and took the time to get to know us and what we were looking for in our new purchase. He explained all the features that the SUV had to offer, so we could narrow down the MUST haves for us.  Shawn knows the product he is selling inside and out. Shawn was a pleasure to work with and before we drove our beautiful new Mercedes off the dealership lot, he made sure our car was fully detailed with a full tank of gas, in perfect order before handing over the keys.

The whole sales team were professional and enjoyable to work with. It was a very positive experiences from the time we walked through the door and were greeted by the front desk to shaking Shawn's hand and driving off in our new Mercedes.

The dealership was very clean and inviting with a lovely lounge area. Very professional environment, at the same time friendly and relaxing.

Anyone interested in purchasing a Mercedes, I definitely recommend you give Shawn Abtahi at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek a call today!

<Review>From experience I know that purchasing or leasing an automobile can be frustrating, arduous, stressful and exhausting.   Not so at Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek!  I had the easiest and best experience ever in leasing my new e400 convertible last week.  I had a pending order on a car at another dealership but there was a delivery delay.  I walked into Stevens Creek one evening to scout alternatives and found a car I liked.  My salesperson, Danesh, said they wanted my business and thus would try to match my other deal, which was aggressive.  I braced myself for hours of painful negotiations....which never happened.  Instead, I presented the deal information to Danesh and the dealer manager Vlad and in 10 seconds, they said they would match it.  That's it.  No haggling, no getting the run-around, just that easy.  I returned to complete the transaction and all went smoothly, and efficiently.  Danesh and his co-workers were extremely professional, accommodating and respectful of my time.   They put all other dealerships I've ever experienced to shame with their integrity and exceptional customer service.  I'm a repeat Mercedes customer and will most definitely return here.  I recommend Danesh and team to anyone considering a Mercedes Benz!!< /Review>< UserId.>

I was in the market for a CPO ML350. I found one that had the options I was looking for on the Stevens Creek MBZ site. I contacted the sale person Charlie Shen to get more information on the vehicle. Charlie was great, very knowledgable and helpful. I made the 30 minute drive to the dealership and met Charlie. His great service continued as we looked at the car and went on a test drive. I wanted to move to purchase the car, but needed to see about my 2008 ML350 and if there was a good trade in opportunity. We successfully worked out the terms, great loan and rate and made it happen. This was a great experience - highly recommend Charlie and the Stevens Creek MBZ dealership.</review>

The entire sales and service department at Steven's Creek made the purchase of our C250 sedan a phenomenal experience. From the time I initiated contact via the website with John Kohlander the internet sales manager through the entire sale, negotiation, finance, and car prep process everyone was the commensurate professionals, extremely knowledgeable, friendly, kind, courteous, helpful, hospital,  and attentive to all of our needs and concerns. I would highly recommend Steven Creek Mercedes Benz as the location to purchase or lease a Mercedes Benz in California.  It was a pleasure and a great car buying experience mainly due to the professionalism and customer service care and skills of Internet Sales Manager John Kohlander, in coordination with Sales Manager Stan Mojaisky.  I would not purchase a Mercedes Benz anywhere else until I gave them an opportunity to earn your trust and business. We were very impressed on how helpful and friendly they were in finding us the right car at the right price. This was by far our best car buying experience ever.</text>

Sami Nurahmed helped me the other day. I had a bad experience with other Mercedes' dealer at AOto mall, so I thought all Mercedes dealer was like that. However, the dealer @ Stevens Creek was totally different! Sami Nurahmed was not very pushy ( like a typical sales person don't know how to deal with a customer in a dealer) and not snobby (that's what i felt @ AOto Mall). It was very comfortable to buying a car. This is how luxury car dealer supposed to be.< /review>

< Review>
My family and I were interested in the new 2017 GLS, but in a specific color.  After doing some minimal research, we knew that Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek had the exact model and color we liked.  But to make sure it was actually available, we called them to do an inventory check, and Charlie Shen was more then happy to help us over the phone.  Once he confirmed it was available, we made our way to take a personal look at it.

As we arrived, we were immediately greeted and felt welcomed by the staff.  As we started "window" shopping, we knew that the GLS was the model we wanted to take a closer look at and test drive.  We requested Charlie since he initially helped us out over the phone.  As he started to help us and answer our questions, we realized how knowledgeable and friendly he was.  We felt NO pressure from him at all during the process.  In actuality, we had another competitor SUV in mind prior to us going there.  We told Charlie about it, and he was still more then helpful and even encouraged us to check out the other SUV to make sure we made the right decision for our family.  He even set us up with a test drive with the floor model, since the actual model we wanted was at their warehouse.

After the test drive, we left to check out our other option, but were back at Mercedes with in hours.  After taking a look at our other possible option, we automatically knew that the quality between the GLS and our secondary option were worlds apart.  The GLS had better power, handling, and of course, options!

Once we came back, Charlie was more then happy to speak with us again, even if we weren't necessarily going to purchase the vehicle that day.  Once we test drove the actual model and color we would eventually buy, we knew we were making the right decision.  Charlie and the rest of his team patiently worked with us to crunch the numbers, and a fair deal on both sides.  In the end, I'm happy to say my family and I walked out that night with the family vehicle of our dreams, and we haven't regretted it since.

The whole process from start to finish took more then 8 hours, and Charlie never complained or made us feel like we were wasting his time.  Even when he didn't know we were seriously going to buy the truck!

Again, my family and I want to thank Charlie and the rest of the Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek team for their service, their understanding, and willingness to work with us to make sure we got the car we wanted, at the price we were happy with!</Review>

If you want to enjoy purchasing a fine car you need to find a fine dealership. I was lucky because I found Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek when I wanted to buy a Mercedes GLC300.

I first spotted the new GLC while driving to an appointment and, after the appointment looked for the closest dealer. Gurwinder Singh, who was to become my principal sales rep, welcomed me to Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek, presented the car and described many details about it, and then let me take it out for a test drive.

The GLC300, Gurwinder, and the overall classiness of the dealership got my immediate attention, so when I got home I spent quite a bit of time on the MBUSA website detailing out a configuration that would suit my needs. You may imagine that my configuration was not immediately available in the U.S., so Gurwinder worked with his manager Samir Karimi to have me to use a special order slot that was available.

Once the car was ordered there was a long wait (during which my 2016 GLC somehow became a 2017 GLC), but through it all Gurwinder, his partner Bryan Tu, and Samir were patient and helpful.

When the car finally arrived I drove it around a bit and then engaged in the inevitable paperwork shuffle while final detailing of the car was done. Then came a brief training session (which is only a start, but a helpful one). Everything was carried out efficiently by courteous staff members, and I left with no unanswered questions.

Over the years I’ve purchased many cars, including several Mercedes, Jaguars, Infinitis, and other fine cars and, of all the dealers I’ve bought from, Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek stands out as the finest experience I’ve had.<//review>

Jake Tran is a great service rep although my experience of interfacing with the scheduler over the phone to get the direction to the store & the receptionist who was sitting on the counter not taking any ownership for client services experience which were horrible until Jake showed up to get my Mercdes taken care of. It included the recall item being fixed, shuttle being scheduled to drive me to work, & to get car washed before the driver took me back to store. Then because the mechanic who messed around my radio configuration to be defaulted as subscription based, I have one full day earful of commercial about the subscription to this radio station until Jake help me reconfigure it back to my KDFC. What a relief!
I suggested Mercdes to put more client services align with Jake from the initial step of contact in the scheduler's desk. Before Jake, the logistic to get connect to Jake was a complete disaster to me. Even on my way to pick up my car, another receptionist sitting on the counter had no idea how to explain what was written on my paper about what could NOT be fixed after I left my car there for a full day?
There's ought to be a better wholistic experience to be built around Jake.
Poor Jake, he has to make it all up for the poorest services I ever had to endure before him & after him. However, because his out-shining services in such a big contrast to the rest of the crowd there, I have to give him the score which is what he deserved.<//Text>

<user>112463251101719813718</user><Text>This is the WORST dealer I have ever been to.
Short Version:
They just do not care about customer service. Once they sell you the vehicle then they don't give a damn. Tin Voung the person who sold me the car, he sent me an email a day later saying - "I am here to help you" - but he never responded to any of my emails of phone calls, TILL DATE!! I have called them atleast 100 times and I have all the email conversations.

Long Version:
I was leasing a BMW, once my lease expired I decided to get a Mercedes GLK. I went all the way from WA state to buy a CPO because they had a vehicle that matches all my requirements. After I bought the car the following are the events that happened:
1. They gave me a faulty Media interface cable, when I called the sales person who attended me, he never responded to my calls or emails. I had to talk to his boss only then they sent me a ACTUAL working cable.

2. When I went to DMV in WA state, the officer there explained me that I do not have all the documentation required to get the vehicle registered on my name. And when I call the guy back he says - "May be the DMV do not know what they are talking!!!" - I go back to DMV and they explain me in detail, I explained the same thing to this guy. It took weeks for him to respond. Finally he says I am redirecting your case to my boss - Cindy. I tried calling here, sending multiple emails - NO RESPONSE. One fine day she responds back saying - "We need the address of DMV. We will overnight it to them" - I give the address and ask for tracking number, no response,my DMV says  they still haven't received anything. It has been 2 and half weeks (at the time of writing) and numerous calls and emails, everytime someone takes down my name and number, no response.

While selling the Extended warranty and other additional stuff, they seem to care about you so much. And once the deal is done, this is what you get. Since I am new to this country I am still figuring out options on what I can do about this, like a consumer court or something.<//Text><rating>1<//rating>< Gmap_id>

Excellent service!
They go above and beyond to satisfy the customer.
PJ!! You're the man.

By the time we went to this showroom, we had actually made up our mind to buy an Audi A6. We thought we'll just checkout Mercedes as well.
The first car we sat in was a fully loaded C300 and we were just blown away with the luxury in this car. That completely changed our opinion.
This was the first time we considered Mercedes Benz as an option and we were very nervous about the financial commitment.

About this showroom:
First off, these guys have a huge inventory. There are so many options to choose from.

Sales person Mushtaba was very welcoming and patient to show us many cars. Sales manager Stan explained to us different financial options and Joseph, the sales manager processed our paper work very efficiently.

PJ, an other Sales Manager is just one hell of a guy!!

After the paperwork, Stan was busy with other customers. We were having second thoughts about the deal we got. PJ looked at our situation and asked "Would $X a month make you a happy customer?" which in itself surprised us but he actually went and made that happen after we said yes.

This is the kind of attitude that keeps customers coming back to them. Excellent job PJ and team. Keep up the good work.<//text>

<review>Was bringing in my SLK for service and every thing was done as requested. I would have have given them 5 star except for one thing. I was not informed that their shuttle service does not go to Milpitas till after the fact. I was given a shuttle to home but then I needed a shuttle back to the dealership, I was then informed that the shuttle doesn't goto Milpitas. I wished I was informed that the shuttle goto Milpitas when I dropped off my car, then I would have gotten a loaner car instead.</review>< Resp>

<rating>5</rating><Text>My family and I were interested in the new 2017 GLS, but in a specific color.  After doing some minimal research, we knew that Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek had the exact model and color we liked.  But to make sure it was actually available, we called them to do an inventory check, and Charlie Shen was more then happy to help us over the phone.  Once he confirmed it was available, we made our way to take a personal look at it.

As we arrived, we were immediately greeted and felt welcomed by the staff.  As we started "window" shopping, we knew that the GLS was the model we wanted to take a closer look at and test drive.  We requested Charlie since he initially helped us out over the phone.  As he started to help us and answer our questions, we realized how knowledgeable and friendly he was.  We felt NO pressure from him at all during the process.  In actuality, we had another competitor SUV in mind prior to us going there.  We told Charlie about it, and he was still more then helpful and even encouraged us to check out the other SUV to make sure we made the right decision for our family.  He even set us up with a test drive with the floor model, since the actual model we wanted was at their warehouse.

After the test drive, we left to check out our other option, but were back at Mercedes with in hours.  After taking a look at our other possible option, we automatically knew that the quality between the GLS and our secondary option were worlds apart.  The GLS had better power, handling, and of course, options!

Once we came back, Charlie was more then happy to speak with us again, even if we weren't necessarily going to purchase the vehicle that day.  Once we test drove the actual model and color we would eventually buy, we knew we were making the right decision.  Charlie and the rest of his team patiently worked with us to crunch the numbers, and a fair deal on both sides.  In the end, I'm happy to say my family and I walked out that night with the family vehicle of our dreams, and we haven't regretted it since.

The whole process from start to finish took more then 8 hours, and Charlie never complained or made us feel like we were wasting his time.  Even when he didn't know we were seriously going to buy the truck!

Again, my family and I want to thank Charlie and the rest of the Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek team for their service, their understanding, and willingness to work with us to make sure we got the car we wanted, at the price we were happy with!< /Text>< pics>

Simply Marvelous...

This is our 6th or 7th time leasing the car and this is one of the BEST experience we had so far...

Slava Aprelenko did a superb service and everything was ready as we agreed mostly on the phone! We walked in and walked out and did not wait much at all!

I was very much impressed with finance manager as he can talk the leasing terms upside down in his sleep and was very helpful!

Keep up the excellent service!<//Review>

We recently bought a 250GLK BlueTEC from Glenn Hartzheim at Smythe, and honestly this was the most pleasant car-buying experience I've ever had. From the onset, our sales professional Glenn Hartzheim addressed every question that we had, and showed us everything that we asked to see, including specs of cars not located at Smythe, as no local car sported the exact configuration that we needed. We finally found a car that suited us well, and when asked about what can be done about pricing, Glenn came back with an offer that we couldn't refuse. Post-purchase, Glenn took his time showing us the features of the car, and was so detailed that my son nearly fell asleep in the backseat! Glenn also delivered the car to us, 50 miles away, when we couldn't pick up the car during the week - the car arrived in perfect condition, all washed and polished.

We couldn't have asked for a better experience than what Glenn and Smythe offered. This is our second new MB from Smythe, and for sure our future cars will again come from the same people.< /Text>

I had the best buying experience of a new car to date at Mercedes-Benz of Stevens Creek. Kamil Beiteshagh went above & beyond to accommodate me in getting the Mercedes-Benz that I wanted, even drove us to the warehouse to look at additional cars that weren't yet listed in their computer system. Kamil's calming demeanor & willingness to answer any questions I had ,explaining the different models & options made the process of buying a new car hassel & stress free & pleasant. I also had a great experience with the sales manager Stan Mojaisky when it came down to discussing the financial portion of the deal, I stated what I wanted in a car & the budget I was working with & he helped me reach that without going back & forth as you'd normally expect. I'll definitely refer all of my friends & family to this dealership & especially to Kamil. I love my new car!</review>

Absolutely the worst thing is to call this dealership or its sister store for a service question.  Hours of waiting, no results no follow up, not even a text, email, or phone call back.  Another example of autonation poor customer service.  MBUSA, wake up, allowing large corporations like autonation, Lithia, Penske, and fletcher jones ruin your brand by squeezing out customer service in order to make a buck.  Shame shame on Mercedes Benz.  I guess I have to find another dealership that will take my money.  I will gladly pay them for professional follow up and courtesy of being professional.</text>

<text>Sami Nurahmed helped me the other day. I had a bad experience with other Mercedes' dealer at AOto mall, so I thought all Mercedes dealer was like that. However, the dealer @ Stevens Creek was totally different! Sami Nurahmed was not very pushy ( like a typical sales person don't know how to deal with a customer in a dealer) and not snobby (that's what i felt @ AOto Mall). It was very comfortable to buying a car. This is how luxury car dealer supposed to be.</text><Name>Coffee Lover</Name>< pictures>

<review>Worst dealership experience I have ever had. I went in to buy sbc/abc module for my car brakes. I provided my vin number at the parts counter and paid 1300 dollars for the part. My mechanic installed the part in the car (1 hour labor) but it locked my whole car into park because I was given the wrong version. We found the safety release and I drove the car to the dealership for help.
This is where I met Susan. Please avoid Susan if you value integrity and want an honest service rep. After one day Susan called me and told me that the part was wrong and they will not charge me labor for taking the part out and reinstalling the replacement part. However, when I went back to the dealership I was charged 3 hours of programming labor.  Susan's explanation did not match Google results. I called three other Mercedes service shops and they all confirmed that there is no programming needed for the unit. I paid another $655 to the stealership because they messed up and Susan has the audacity to make up stories.
Please avoid stealership if you are looking for an honest service department. Thanks to Yelp and Google review consumers can share their experiences with each other. Avoid the Susan!!  Find another mercedes shop on Yelp. It will save you hundreds of dollars< /review>< Pics>

Was looking at a c230 and was comparing them to another c230 in santa cruz same price. Now the sales person showed me the car very nice till i noticed the tires were worn to the point the needed new ones not to mention 3 of the 4 wheels were scrapped bad not a little very noticeable. So doing quick math in my head i notice it would cost me another two thousand for tires and thousands the replace rims so when offered them 8000 cash to walk out the door since i had to replace more than what was needed. Sales guy with a smerk was no we can. Ok well i know he was judging me not thinking we have money thats fine my husband is a highly known union crane operator making 41.06 an hour so next time why dont you teach your sales people not to judge thier customers will never go here again nor will ever recommend this place due to the snotty attitudes you get if not looking the way they expect.<//review>

One of the best retails my wife and i ever been to! They did their best to accomodate all our requests, very nice showroom with a bar that lets you enjoy coffee while waiting for the transaction, inviting and clean showroom with lots of cars to choose from, all the sales representative were very helpful and knowledgeable esp. Gurwinder Singh and Charlie Shen, very nice people and manager's were very accomodating as well. Mr. Jim from the paper works is a person with a high sense of humor and made sure we are completely good amd satisfied with our choices and paperworks before we leave his office and he is the fastes guy we've ever been to in terms of paperworks! Highly recommended place if you are shopping for your new or next car!</review>

< review>
Once again (26 years.. ) we bought a vehicule (2013 SL550)  at Smythe, from the one and only Tony Spencer. As always before, Tony was the competent and pleasant pro, knowing and explaining the vehicle (many new functions) in full and smoothing the path through all aspects of the transaction. Highly recommended if you believe in Sales being a great service profession. As for the vehicle, first impression is very pleasant, great improvement on our 2008 SL500 -- I've driven three successive SL generations since 1991.<//review>

Entering the dealership we were unsure of what we were going to buy but the entire experience at Steven Creek Mercedes was nothing but positive.  We initially did not believe we would be able to fit the E350 into our budget but the Stevens Creek team made it happen.

My representative was Danesh Ghiasi and he was simply outstanding.  We told him our price concern and he stated where there was a will, there was a way.  Sure enough, Danesh and others found the way to make it work to the satisfaction of both parties.  Danesh supported us through the entire process and as we arrived at the location late in the day, we were unable to complete all activities and take the car home that night.  He agreed to have everything ready the next day at an agreed time and when we arrived, just like he stated, we were in and out.

Stacy now has her dream car and I can't thank the Steven Creek team enough, especially Danesh.  If you are looking for a Mercedes do yourself a favor and visit Stevens Creek Mercedes.  You will not be disappointed!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I recently leased a C300 from Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek. The process was just as I had hoped.  I first contacted the dealership through TrueCar and the account executive, Samir Karimi, gave me prompt quotes for a few different cars.  I asked that he provide his best price because I intended to buy from the dealership that provided the best price.  I disdain the car buying process.  He said he would provide his best price and I confirmed his price was lower than two other dealerships for the same car and much lower than the average discount from MSRP reported through sites like TrueCar.  My other instructions were to have the car and paperwork ready when I came into the dealership.  I was at the dealership for only 20 minutes, which exceeded my expectations.  Samir also went over and beyond his duty after the sale.  We had to take the car into the dealership for a software update to the touchpad and warranty work on the tires.  We intended to receive the instructions on car features during that visit, but the applicable person was not at the dealership at that time.  Samir volunteered to come to our home and showed us how to use at the convenience of our home one night at 8 p.m. Excellent service and I will buy my next Mercedes from him.< /Text>

<Review>I have been working with Manuel Chua (sales dept) and it has been the greatest car buying experience I've ever had.

A couple of weeks back (6-8 weeks), I've showed up at Smythe and was looking for the new CLA250. Manuel showed me one of their CLAs but also pointed out that all of them are already pre-sold. He explained me in detail how the order process would work and that it takes 3-4 months until the car would be delivered. Since I didn't want to pre-order a car, Manuel offered to keep an eye on any newly arriving CLAs and let me know as soon as one becomes available.

In the meantime I was also looking at other cars as I already accepted that I won't get a CLA250 in the near future. However, last Friday, I received a call from Manuel, saying: Jan, we have YOUR car here! It just arrived, come tomorrow to test drive it!!! I was positive surprised that Manuel still kept me in mind and seriously kept an eye on the CLAs for me. Of course, I accepted his offer and test drove the CLA250. Since I like to go surfing on my weekends, I wanted to make sure that my car fits all my needs and I even showed up with a surfboard before buying the car. Manuel was happy to show me how we can fit the surfboard INSIDE the car. Since the surfboard fits in the car, I was happy to move on with buying this beauty. After signing all the papers, I've realized that the the Towing Eye Cover was missing on my front pumper. Unfortunately, the service department was already closed and they do not open on Sundays. However, Manuel promised me to get the cover as soon as possible to me. As expected, this afternoon I've received an email stating that the cover is ready for pick-up and installation. When I came to the dealership, Manuel was already waiting for me and also gave me a quick tour through their new office building. Also, he introduced to me to their GM and the service department.

Smythe and especially Manuel Chua have made buying a brand new CLA250 a very easy decision for me.

Summary:
- No buying pressure while browsing around and test driving cars
- Helpful and knowledgeable sales department
- Friendly and professional environment, it almost feels like you know the whole dealership already for years
- Keep their promises
- Constant follow-ups to ensure that you enjoy your new car

I would recommend this dealership without any doubts to all my friends and family members. If you are looking for a Mercedes-Benz, keep an eye out for Manuel Chua at Smythe. I am certain you'll have the same, amazing, customer experience as I did.< /Review>< rating>

< Review>
This was my first Car, Mercedez CLA 250, and it goes without saying how much it matters when it is the first one. I visited couple of other places, and then came here. In general when you are buying a Mercedez, your experience of buying a car is always special. That is at least how I felt when I was visiting dealerships.

But coming to Stevens Creek, they really make you feel happy, whether its just the deal they are offering to you, or the way they make you feel about the car. I was dealing with Mushtaba here, and he was a delight to work with. He knew what I was looking for, and how I only cared about that. He was the kind of person who tried to arrange for me what I wanted, and did not push on me other deals just to make a sale happen, which was really cool. Even after I had already decided to go ahead with this dealership, the relation did not get over. They helped me in figuring out everything; from first time complicated paperwork, good financing, to out of the door assistance, it was perfect.

Till date, Mushtaba is always available for any help that I may require. I would like to thank them for my wonderful experience. :)<//Review>

We purchased the 2014 Mercedes-Benz C-series on 11/24/2013. Our sales representive, Anmar Kamil was extremely helpful and highly knowledgeable.  We had a wonderful experience dealing with Smythe European Maybach. Special Thanks to Anmar; he is a real gentleman, who took his time to explain and answer all our questions during and after the delivery of the car.

I recently leased a C300 from Mercedes Benz of Stevens Creek. The process was just as I had hoped.  I first contacted the dealership through TrueCar and the account executive, Samir Karimi, gave me prompt quotes for a few different cars.  I asked that he provide his best price because I intended to buy from the dealership that provided the best price.  I disdain the car buying process.  He said he would provide his best price and I confirmed his price was lower than two other dealerships for the same car and much lower than the average discount from MSRP reported through sites like TrueCar.  My other instructions were to have the car and paperwork ready when I came into the dealership.  I was at the dealership for only 20 minutes, which exceeded my expectations.  Samir also went over and beyond his duty after the sale.  We had to take the car into the dealership for a software update to the touchpad and warranty work on the tires.  We intended to receive the instructions on car features during that visit, but the applicable person was not at the dealership at that time.  Samir volunteered to come to our home and showed us how to use at the convenience of our home one night at 8 p.m. Excellent service and I will buy my next Mercedes from him.< /Text>

I highly recommend this dealership for shopping new or used cars. The price is great and the after sales service is excellent. My sales person, Mr. FeriDon Dizadji is truly professional.

As always before, Tony was the competent and pleasant pro, knowing and explaining the vehicle (many new functions) in full and smoothing the path through all aspects of the transaction. Highly recommended if you believe in Sales being a great service profession. As for the vehicle, first impression is very pleasant, great improvement on our 2008 SL500 -- I've driven three successive SL generations since 1991.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1368670895513, 'text': "Jean-Louis, We're so happy to hear that you were well taken care of by Tony and the rest of the team.

<rate>5< /rate><Review>The Smythe sales Rep Leland was exceptional and provided superior service. Very attentive to details and kept us informed on each step of the sales transaction and the features of the new 2014 SLK250 we purchased Aug 2013.

Lehand makes you feel at home immediately, so much so you begin to feel as if you had known him for years. As a testimony of the service and care we received last March when we purchased a 2013 E350. I made it  point to drive from the east bay to the south bay to purchase the SLK250 from Lehand. He is the kind of guy who makes a dealership stand out amongst the rest.

Also followed up with us to see if all is going well and if we needed any assistance from him. In my book he is a 5 star guy and more than a sales rep but friend who cares for his customers. Dealerships should have more guys like Lehland.

I would drive out of my way to buy from Lehland and the Smythe dealership. Also the  staff that supports Lehland were awesome, always sincere smiles and helpful. Brian in finance was fantastic and should be congratulated on his efficiency and awareness of current trends; he was able to beat the loan % I had which was extremely good and attentive and fast.

Staff at Smythe keep up the great work!!! :-)

The GLK350 is my 5th mercedes benz and happy to share that it is the best car buying experience I've had. We all dread dealing with car dealers who put the ungodly pressure.... what a delight it was to work with Mike Grosson who "listened" to what I wanted and was a true professional!
They will have my business and won't hesitate to recommend to all my colleagues, friends and family.

Took my vehicle in for check engine problem. They gave me an estimate of $1300 for a DFE heater and $920.00 labor. I declined it and had it done somewhere else for a lot less.</Text>

Typical car dealer place, keep you waiting,  They try to do a credit check when you are  paying in cash or cashier check. Not a great nor bad experience.<//text>

The dealership was very crowded that morning, but the service staff is very courteous, and because they let me waited for quite sometime and still cannot get a loaner car, they sent me back home with Uber and gave me a free tire rotation.< /text>

The service and service reps have been great: Ron Broz, Justin Gray and now John Stansberry. John is a superb representative for Mercedes of Stevens Creek. He is a true expert and we are very happy to have him take care of us. I just follow his advice entirely. John Stansbery is not allowed to be anywhere else than Mercedes of Stevens Creek!

< review>
(Translated by Google) I bought a new car on July 14, 2018. I am very satisfied with their service. Especially their salesperson Daniel Ma. This guy is young, real, does not go around in circles, and the price is reasonable.
I used to spend a whole day when I bought a car, and people were exhausted and dizzy. This time I drove my beloved car home in only half a day. Here we once again thank Mr. Ma for his excellent service.

我是2018年7月14日買的新車。我對他們的服務非常滿意。特別是他們的銷售人員Daniel Ma。這個小伙年輕、實在，不繞圈子，價格又合理。
以前我買車的時候都會花上一整天的時間，而人又弄得精疲力盡 頭暈眼花的，這次只用了半天的時間就開着我心愛的車回家了。在這里我們再次謝謝馬先生對我們的優質服務。< /review>
