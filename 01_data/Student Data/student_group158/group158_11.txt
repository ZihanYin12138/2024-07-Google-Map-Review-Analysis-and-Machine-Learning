I worked with Quentin Burt to get all the build and permit details sorted.  The building turned out exactly like the one I designed on the Tuff Shed website, and I could not be happier with it.  Every part of the process was explained clearly, and expectations were consistently met, or exceeded.  The installers were fast, courteous, and professional. My only problem is now I have to improve my house to make it look as nice as the shed does! Thanks Tuff Shed, and thanks Quentin!<//Review>< Date>

Very POOR/BAD customer service.   Will lie to you and then blame you for it.  For a client to spend almost 5k dollars and be treated like a 5 year old. Bad bad bad.  Borris the installer was awesome.  I like the product but due to the poor customer service I will not by another product for any if my other properties.< /review>

<text>Ordered the Premier Barn Shed 12x10.  Quentin Burt is an exceptional asset to Tuff Shed.  This is the 3rd shed in the past 5 years that he has handled for my family.  He knows and understands the business, very knowledgeable with city codes, and makes the building portion of the shed easy.  Installation was on time and completed in one day.  Thanks again, Quentin!</text><Gmap_id>0x809ad9f8a28159d3:0xcfd12bad62733cfa< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

Do not buy with Tuff Shed! You are better buying from any other Shed place! I purchased a lovely shed that they had displayed outside. I waited for the shed to go into production and to be delivered. I understand that cause of Covid-19 it is backed up on delivery I don't have a problem with that its fine, but however I do have a problem with the way I received my shed! Damaged and bent material and used material! I did not want to accept it but the installers told me that they are just installers not the fabricators and this is what they have that I need to contact the manufacturer. I said ok but I don't want that damaged used shed and they said if they take it back I will have to pay 15% of the price! In short they are telling me that I'm forced to take the broken used shed or else I will have to pay for their broken used shed! They installed it and they did absolutely their best in trying to make it work but however even with their best they cannot fix the manufacturer defects. The shed has nail holes all over it, because it has been used before and disassembled then sent to me. It has cracks and many other defects. The roof is basically holding on a nail! I contacted customer service and was sent to Warranty manager John and it looks like he is the only guy that actually answers the phone, but however he claims that because of Covid-19 they are using any wood they have left in storage. In short used material. He said they will fix the holes with silicone. That is absolutely horrible because with in a year or less that silicone will form mold. I have that experience with where I live. I contacted the seller Tom and showed him the status of my shed and even he was shocked. He said he was going to send all the pictures and everything to the main manager of Tuff Shed and the only person that is actually trying to do anything is John, the so called main manager basically tuck his tail between his legs and disappeared from this earth because I was supposed to get a call within 24 hours..weeks passed and I didn't get anything. I'm stuck with a USED shed that was sold to me for NEW price. Absolutely horrible quality and material. Unsafe and a big safety hazard. It is like buying a new car and receiving the car with dents and being told that if you don't take it they will charge 15% of the price and when you are forced to take it they tell you they will take it to the shop and pull the dents out. Doesn't make it new, but I'm guessing NEW and USED is the same word to Tuff Shed. Everyone please stay away from this company! They scam, lie, hustle, and their people in power ignore. Save your money and you are better with any other shed company, even a handyman will do a better job than their 2year old that fabricates their wood. They do not stand by their word on quality at all! Have a look at my pictures. If you want a shed like mine with those problems, then by all means go buy Tuff Shed. Pictures speak louder than words. I was going to buy bigger sheds into a house size with Tuff Shed but after this NEVER AGAIN! I don't recommend to anyone to use this company! A file has been claimed to the Better Business Bureau, hopefully they can resolve and report this company. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. Stay away from Tuff Shed and stay safe! God Bless.</text>

When the shed arrived however it was not light brown; it was basically white. It doesn't match anything in my backyard and it sticks out like a sore thumb.

I talked to the installers and asked them what could be done to fix it before this shed is put together onsite. They made the call into the office and ultimately came back and said that the office wouldn't allow them to paint it a new color.

I spoke with Quentin Burt, the salesman who sold me the shed and he argued with me defensively for 8 minutes stating that I picked the colors and he only put it in the computer. I explained to him that it doesn't match his design and he actually hung up the phone on me!

I called back and spoke with the manager. He was like a robot on repeat. The fine print of the contract says that colors are an approximation. He was literally screamed at me that they have no obligation to repaint and that I could take it as is or return it. I asked how much would it be to repaint and he said it would cost $400. I asked why didn't you start with that? He said because they are not paying for it. They refused to repaint it the same day however regardless if I paid for it or not.

Besides being entirely the wrong color the shed seems fine. Suffice it to say this place will never get any future business from me.<//Text></record>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Tuff Shed built a 16 x 24 Premiere Pro Ranch garage for me and I am satisfied with the final product and the customer service provided.

The build wasn't flawless, but Tuff Shed addressed the problems and fixed it in a timely manner.  Ben and his crew showed up as scheduled, on time, and worked continuously while they were here.  A section of the wall was damaged during the build and was replaced without me having to ask.  There were some small pieces that weren't installed by the time the crew left.  After contacting Tuff Shed a crew member was sent out to put in the finishing touches and he even helped me secure the shed doors better.

Quentin helped me through the whole process from ordering to the final inspection.  He did a phenomenal job with quickly answering and addressing any questions or concerns I had.  He gave great advice and was willing to go out of his way to help me with measurements and paint.  Without his help the build would not have moved along in the timeline given.

Thank you to the Tuff Shed crew and a HUGE thank you to Quentin!</Review>< pics>

This place in Yuba City California is the greatest. The lady who runs it for tough shed is totally awesome and people like her make tough shed what it is and why they get all the sales they do. I tried 6 times through Home Depot to purchase a small one and they wouldn’t help me, so I finally went into the main office of tough shed and Met with Kimberly, she sold me a medium size one with all the accessories for under 6000, and that’s including installation , foundation peers, Windows, insulation’s, benches and window boxes n doors a Dutch door. It really looks like a Tiny house but I’m making it my She Shed. Thanks tough she’s for having such high quality products and good sales reps that really represent you. Also everything is Covid safe and all precautions are taken at this location, so if your looking to add a room, have a man cave or she shed or granny pad, come on down to Tharp and go into tough she’s and see Kim, tell em Denise sent ya!!!!< /review>

<Review>Everyone at Tuff Shed , Sacramento, Are fantastic. We had some sheds installed about 3 years ago and during a recent wind storm, we lost a lot of shingles off one of the roofs.I called about some warranty work on this shed,{7 year warranty}. I expected a little runaround based on the amount of time. NOPE the Lady Jessica, and everyone else were so polite, helpful and wanted nothing more than to make things right.The Tech showed up on time, SO polite and professional, did the repairs and even removed all the old shingles, without being asked. All this and still I was thanked for being their customer. What a perfect business model. WOW I am so impressed.
THANK YOU , Tuff Shed of Sacramento.
Most sincerely,
Roy Sharp<//Review>< response>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>Junk shed.  Studs weren't nailed to top plates  walls were crooked, trim wasn't plumb,  windows were out of plumb and not sealed. Nothing about this shed was built to current building standards. It's the most expensive shed on the market behind built and installed by the lowest bidder. Beware!<//Review><UserId.>103757430887233591201<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>
<Review>My experience with Tuff Shed was horrible. I purchased a shed through a third party (Home Depot) and I was told the shed would be delivered in 4-6 weeks, well that was almost 8 weeks ago now and no shed, no call from anyone at Tuff shed. Originally the shed I purchased from Home Depot included delivery through Tuff Shed. My wife and I tried calling Tuff Shed multiple times since week 4 with no response at all we only got a voicemail. Never had a single return call from anybody. When we called Home Depot to check on what was going on, they explained a note Tuff Shed put into our account said they had tried contacting us but that is an outright lie, we have been anticipating this shed we wouldn’t have missed or forgotten a voicemail or phone call from them. There was also a note about their “trailer being stolen” which makes no sense on why that would be a problem, I would assume that a business like Tuff Shed would have multiple trailers and I believe they could have responded to any of our numerous voicemails and phone calls to explain that situation. Even Home Depot couldn’t get a hold of anyone at Tuff Shed today, so we have since canceled our order. We will take our business elsewhere I don’t understand how any respectable business can operate this way and still be regarded as “one of the best”. I understand the Covid-19 epidemic is still going on strong but that is no excuse for a business that is still open and functional to operate the way they have. If I could give 0 stars I would.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><user_id>114087689478724011209<//user_id>< name>

They did a fantastic job. Nathan Lammasson saw the whole job through from sale to finish. Now were they perfect ? No there was a mix up on the custom paint color I ordered which can happen. But what happened next shows what a company of high integrity they are at Tuff Shed. They sent a painter out to repaint the entire shed to correct their mistake. They owned up to it as well as fixed it and for that I give them 5 stars because I couldn't be happier with the final product. Great job guys thanks< /text>< pictures>

<username>Michelle Wilkinson</username><Time>1515535903887<//Time><rate>2</rate>< review>
Purchased on 10/28, explained we needed it ASAP before we purchased. Were told it would be installed in 3-4 weeks. We asked to be put on a short call list. Was installed on 12/18- late. Now here we are, its 1/9. I have a shed- that looks great. But can't be used because there are big holes were the windows should be (and we are told the parts on order). Seriously? Great product but delivery/installation/communication on a reasonable time line is a joke.<//review>

Sales personal very knowledgeable and helpful in picking out your shed.
Install is a complete 180 fromn sales. To many installs not enough installers. Don't plan on having your shed installed on your scheduled day or completed in the same day. Commication after sale is sketchy.<//review>

We went almost at closing time so the selection was limited. The bread we did get was good and soft, they also have alot of snacks like taquis,mexican candy and milk to go with the sweet bread. The lady that helped us was very nice and polite. We will definitely be back.<//Text>

<Review>The first time I went, I bought sweet bread and I loved it. I went today again and it was not the same. The sweet breads that I went for, were a little on the old side. I was a bit disappointed. They do make a really good cream filled pastry though. Also, the cashier was very nice.<//Review>< pictures>

Everything is always delicious here! Best to come in the morning so you can have your pick of the pan dulce, but even if you come in the afternoon there is still plenty to choose from. Everything is fresh and the service is wonderful!< /Review>

My husband's aunt used to work there and she said that where they make the bread is really dirty and they don't clean where they make the bread. She also said that the owner doesn't let them have breaks how your supposed to and when they  get their lunch time they can't sit they have to eat standing up I guess that's why I always see different people working there.  The other dayw I went to go buy bread cuz my favorite bakery was closed there was a can and I tried to moved it and accidentally fell she got mad I was like really I had apologize and she said that I shouldn't of moved it I told her that it was on the way and she didn't care. Thanks to the customers her family eats.< /text>

< Review>
My hubby and I just purchased our first travel trailer from Kevin at Reed’s and he was absolutely wonderful!! We felt at ease with him immediately. He is so warm, intelligent, and passionate! He was the deciding factor for us buying our trailer from Reed's. We both felt that he took a genuine interest in us and really worked to understand our desires so that he could align with us and help us find the right fit. We originally came in looking at a used Wildcat trailer, but ended up buying a Cougar and we’re thrilled with it. Mary Liz on their financing team was great too!! She is very knowledgeable, kind, and was not pushy at all. We had a bad experience with this step of the process buying a car a few years back, and feel so grateful that Mary Liz was the opposite. She gave us the facts on the extended warranty so that we could decide, rather than pushing her own agenda. They have an amazing team at Reed’s and we highly recommend them!!!< /Review>

<Review>Mike was very courteous and professional about our need for a cargo trailer.  No pressure, just good information and he allowed us to decide between a few sizes and styles.  It was a great experience.
Thanks Mike,
Richard & Barbara Krause< /Review>< Pics>

I can only speak for their parts department.  Their parts department is convenient in a pinch, but priced high. Caution purchasing anything electronic, as they do not allow returns.<//text>

The lady knew everything in the parts department and they had a good supply of everything. Glad they had what I needed...I didn't compare price online

Service department is booked out for months so they'll refer you to some one else if you need help urgently.

All these companies are booked out for months but that probably means they're good and there is a large demand.

Room for parking with a trailer.<//text>

Our walk through with Trevor was great.  He was knowledgeable and thorough.  If he didn't know the answer to one of our questions, he quickly found the answer.  We are happy and satisfied with our 3rd Travel Trailer purchase with Reeds!!  Guy and Staff....you all Rock<//Text>

Excelent equipment, I was shopping around for a utility trailer, I found Reed's the best deal in town, for the quality of product, (trailer) that's for that, now for the sales people, and mechanics/technician was a  pleasure to deal with, nice people, excellent customer service, excellent business!! Will do more business in the near future.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Several weeks ago we went to Reed's to look at and for a travel trailer.   Reed's was easy to find and we noticed a large inventory.
We have tent camped for years but knew nothing about travel trailers.  Along came Mike who was fantastic.   I told him we knew nothing and were just looking.  No problem, he spent his time showing us trailers my Tundra would pull.  We talked about pros and cons of various trailers and floor plans. We thanked Mike and went to look at other makes and models.  After a full week of looking at many other make and models at many dealers we decided we wanted to deal with Reed's.
We returned to Reed's  and Mike again showed us the trailers we could pull.  He found the ONE that really grabbed our interest and we had a trailer.
Mike is a very professional salesman.  No pressure, full of information, and very friendly.
When the trailer was ready to go we did our walk thru.  Again everything was informative and professional.
Reed's is a great dealership to work with.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Buyer Beware! I am looking to purchase a used 5th wheel. Found one I liked and they say that they'll do the 101 point check and clean it up and make sure everything's working AFTER you give them a non-refundable deposit. Who does that? The unit you are looking to purchase should have been detailed and in good working order BEFORE you purchase, not after. Then I asked to bring the contract with me to a friends b/c I am unfamiliar with buying an RV and they told me to go buy elsewhere. So, if you are the kind of person that wants to know what you're buying before you buy, this isn't the place to go. No, I didn't give the deposit and I asked to see their contract, go over with a friend and then I would make my decision. They told me where to go. I didn't need persuading :-)<//review>

Went there to look at RV's . Went in to the sales office they said look around, they were unlocked, NONE were open. Found a cleaning guy who then went and got someone, who was going to get a key to open one. Never saw him again. Tons of people walking around moving trailers etc and not one person asked  if we needed help. What an unprofessional sales organization, no salesman. Had my checkbook open and ready. Although I live in Petaluma, I am going to drive to Sacramento to purchase one. What a joke!</Review>

< Review>
My husband and I had an outstanding sales experience at Reed’s Trailer Sales.  We just purchased a 2020 Coachmen Freedom Express 192RBS, the perfect couple’s trailer.  We had been looking at this model for a long time, and we were thrilled when Reed’s started to carry the Freedom Express line. We wanted a trailer that was towable with our mid-size SUV, which had a big fresh water tank for dry camping and a true walk-around queen (60”x80”) bed. This trailer has a slide-out sofa, leaving us ample floor space to maneuver around our two large dogs.

Our sales experience was perfect.  Kevin Fowler, our salesman, was very kind and knowledgeable, a great listener, and absolutely passionate about this RV line.  We had met with him on two separate occasions and felt absolutely no pressure either time.  Previously he toured us through their Lance trailers, which are quite nice, but none quite fit our criteria.  Even though we decided the Lance was not going to work out for us, Kevin was very nice.  He reiterated their no-pressure policy, and we left Reed’s with a great first impression of their business.   We have been to other dealerships where the attitude of the sales staff was extremely impatient and high pressure.  Kevin was a breath of fresh air.

When it came time to negotiate the price, we were once again pleasantly surprised.  Kevin was able to get us a teacher discount.  We knew the best price for this coach at several other distant dealerships, and Reed’s gave us a great deal.  Dan Reed was supervising our sale, and he clearly values his customers.  Within an hour we met with Juliana in finance and had an executed contract.  Once again, we had a great experience.  She quickly secured a loan with Redwood Credit Union in a very seamless process.  Although we opted to buy an extended warranty (at a very reasonable price), there was zero pressure from Juliana.

When we came to pick up our trailer the following week, Brian did an awesome job assisting us with our walk-through.  He showed us how everything worked.  Again, he took his time, answered all of our questions, and helped us to hitch up the trailer.

We haven’t had our shake-down cruise yet, but we have had a great time setting everything up in our trailer. We are super excited. We took a great deal of time researching trailers and dealerships before we made a purchase.  We are so glad that we were able to buy from Reed’s, and we highly recommend this dealership.

Sincerely,
R&J</Review>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ! I really do not have the words to state how bad this transaction was and this comes from someone who owned more then 100 vehicles in my past 42 years.  This purchase was the worst of them all!   Two weeks ago, I purchased a 2017 Jayco Class C from Reed's trailer Sales.  The sale started out normal till GUY ( sales manager ) got involved, from there things went quickly down hill, GUY managed to hang up the phone on me a more than a few times, would not return my calls and was plain rude throughout the entire purchase.
1) From the first day, first 5 minutes of coming into the lot, I asked for a Car Fax and was told one would be provided, on day 3 at four PM with NO Car Fax in sight, I kept asking and everyone kept dodging my question, one associate even stated " RV's dont come with Car Faxes"  I thought thats strange since they have VIN numbers?   At the end, I finally a spend $39 usd and purchased my own car fax.  ( This is just the beginning of the nightmare )
2) GUY confirmed  a 110 point inspection, it was clear the RV DID NOT GO THROUH ANY INSPECTION!  Each time we went over an item something did not function, water did not turn on and water tank was empty, mechanic was sent out to look at the water pump.
3) Slide OUT did not open or close, when I asked about this number of associates told me its normal, or that the battery is low or that the vehicle is not level or that it was not used for a while and that it will "loosen up"  My wife and I who own another unit with a slide out that functions properly where looking at each other in disbelief that this was happening.  Each time one guy would leave  a another one would show up, each time a different lie, to this day the Slide Out does NOT work properly!  ( see photos below ) it does not close and seal up, potentially letting water into the vehicle.  Here i was purchasing a vehicle in AS IS CONDITION WITH NO WARRANTY!!!
4) Fridge was not working, Propane tank was empty, when I asked to top off on Propane I was told it would be taken care of, then another guy stated that he would give a voucher, we could not verify if the fridge, oven and heater were working since NO propane was in the tank and everyone was just showing it off to another associate who did not ever solve any issues.
5) Started the Generator which was burning up and smoking, a tech came out and adjusted it, burning smell went away.  Every time I asked a question about the RV the associate was not able to show the function of the item and stated that someone else would come out and explain it to us or simply said " I dont know how that works "
6) I was not provided a license plates, second set of keys or even a simple Thank you on my way out!
7) Awning barely rolled out, dirt and leaves dropped out and would not close unless hand helped, when I brought this up to their attention I was told its normal.
8) As 5 pm was rolling around I returned to the sales office asking for help, for a  write up of the items that were clearly not working ( that I knew about at that moment ) and NO one wanted to help, stating that whoever is in charge is not there and GUY will not do it.  I felt that I was forced to purchase a vehicle that had many issues with NO warranty at all.  Finally in a shouting match with GUY the Service Manager ( nicest guy of them all ) was called and signed off stating that the awning, slide out and drawers would be adjusted at dealer cost.  When 5 Pm rolled around everyone bolts out of the dealership, I ended up getting into the vehicle ( for the first time behind the wheel ) and driving it home since so much time was spend and I just wanted the nightmare to end.  To Sum things up:  GUY has NO Clue at all in regards to how customers should be treated and wants a lay down sale.   The other sales people who follow his lead do not work as a team.  Bottom line, the vehicle DID NOT go through ANY inspection and has ( to date ) many issues that need to be taken care of, GUY and the sales associates need to be re-schooled on the basics of customer service.

<text>These guys are great. Kevin Fowler was my sales person and took excellent care of me and my family. He got us a great deal and even met us after hours to accommodate our work schedule. Tammy got me excellent financing with great terms and went above and beyond. Even spoke with Dan Reed and I appreciated his down to earth approach to the customer experience. Nothing bad to say about this place!< /text>< rate>

<text>Bought a 2007 Keystone Laredo Fifth Wheel and couldn't be happier with the purchase. Great Price! Great Service! Our salesperson, Martin, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful throughout the purchase. The service department was outstanding! They went above and beyond and even repaired the wiring on my truck to ensure that we were safe on the road before we left. Over the last six months, we looked at hundreds of different trailers at many different RV lots, but Reeds was definitely my favorite of them all... And our Salesperson Martin is the best of the best.... I wouldn't go anywhere else!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Reeds did a amazing job servicing my 2017 Jayco Melbourne.  The entire staff went up and beyond in making sure that everything was taken care of properly. Had follow up calls and went over all the items that were serviced.  My slide out and all other items on the vehicle are now in perfect order.  Thank you Reeds!<//Review>< Pics>

Shopping around for a new trailer and stopped in here, Guy showed around and was so informative and friendly. Excellent customer service and I found one that I think will be perfect for all our wants and needs in a travel trailer. Shop local, and they have a repair shop on site. I hope we buy the one I checked out and from Reed's!! Thanks Guy :-)<//Review>

As a small business we often have to make difficult decisions. In response to people like yourself requesting us to be open Saturday we tried it for 2 years. It requires 2 People to operate the store and as it turned out we lost money every Saturday while it remained open. We are a local family owned business and we try hard to please our customers. Parts is a low profit business now with the internet sales and we only keep the store open only as a convenience to our customers while the service dept is open during the week.\nI hope you understand and will reconsider giving us the poor review. sincerely, Dan Reed owner'}< /response>< Review>
It escapes me how a RV parts store can be closed during the weekend (when the general population works on their RV's) and be still operating. Hey guys.....Everyone works during your business hours 8 to 5, so how can we get to your store to buy parts when we are working? Suggest maybe being closed Sunday and Monday - open Tuesday thru Saturday......Just sayin'......Umm Hello?<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>We have just recently purchased our second trailer from Reed's Trailer in 10 years and the experience was great the first time and it was great the second time, we upgraded from a Keystone Sprinter fifth wheel trailer to a much nicer Montana Fifth wheel, Dan and his people are easy to do business with and very helpful in the process, we have had very few issues with either trailer but when the service department was needed they did a great job in fixing the trailer, I would highly recommend that if you are looking for a trailer go see these folks, they are knowledgeable and friendly and will get you "hooked up"</Review>< pics>

<text>I'm going to say "Meh." We purchased a Lance camper from them in late 2015. They were very attentive until all the papers were signed and then it seemed as if we no longer existed. We had an issue that needed to be fixed and I stupidly left my batteries on the camper.  When we came back to pick up the battery box was 100% filled with water (it had rained a lot while we were gone) and the batteries were completely submerged and completely dead. Completely unapologetic "Oh it'll be fine", even though they were completely charged and dry when we dropped the camper off. If you're not up on lead/acid batteries, they really shouldn't be discharged to less than half of capacity. I would think being submerged in water wouldn't be great for them either.  And after all that they fixed one thing and said they fixed one other thing, but didn't.  Also, you can only drop off for service during the week, so if you have - say - a job, you're SOL.  They are open on weekends, but they just won't let you drop off for service on the weekends.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Reed's is in my personal experience absolutely honest, acting with integrity and good will, and in my case, wonderful generosity. This includes both sales and service.

<Text>Went travel trailer shopping and first stop was Reeds. Unfortunately my experience was not good. Every single trailer was locked and it was the middle of the day!  When we finally located a sales person, he said they were all locked due to the wind. That made no sense. Doors being shut is one thing but locking them was an unnecessary barrier. Waited 10 minutes but no one ever helped us so we left. Purchased a trailer elsewhere. Just too bad that locked doors prevented a sale</Text><Rating>1< /Rating><time>1530722323522</time><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x8085b4e74ce70d35:0xd55a0cd89dc608d0</Gmap_id></record>

<text>My last visit to Reed's (yesterday) will be my very last visit to Reed's.

have been buying parts for my old travel trailer for a few months. I started going there because they were handy and the guy who helped me knew what he was talking about and was personable. These are more important qualities than price.
My trailer is old, and had been neglected for years, so I have had many small repairs and replacements. I expect to buy a new larger rv within the next year, but want to learn with the old one.

Yesterday I wanted to return a part, in the package, with their tag, bought w a card. No receipt, no return.

(This finally got fixed by my original sales guy, but...)

In the meantime I asked if there were ANY options to my very inefficient heating system. I was referred to a 3rd guy.
This guy was a real piece of work. Didn't listen, interrupted me, repeatedly. No, no options. Nothing. Then hrblectured me on the meaning of RV.  They are only for weekends, no need to be efficient, this is the way it is and, it seemed, I was wrong to even suggest anything else.
He didn't say that he knew of no solutions, he said there were none. End of story. And tht is the way it is and should be.
Did I mentioned that he interrupted me.

Perhaps I am not their type of customer. I. Haven't spent a fortune, my current trailer looks a bit of a wreck, I ask questions  I have not mentioned the future purchase, but I won't buy the 100k model, anyway. They don't need me.

No. I am just a guy who doesn't care about Price, am loyal to good service. Asks some questions, tries to treat everyone as if we are or will be friends.

Oh, and I am a guy who writes reviews.

The One Star is for the one guy, the first guy that helped. He was great.

I don't think they are in the RV sales business. Not a person anywhere. When we asked someone moving an RV, they were just as clueless. Go visit a real sales organization and see how this business works.</Review>

Very polite, felt they had my best interest at heart and replaced a tire which would have cost me more than double from Midas down the road.     All in 20 minutes from the time I walked in. Would definitely use them again.

Just an update. I did have a problem with the tire going flat the next day and it had a slight hole when tested ( it was a used tire) and they took care of it right away and were very polite. That impressed me even more.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>I had my tires installed and balanced at this location on Thursday October 24th and I have been having problems ever since. Their tire installation machine damaged my brand new mag wheel on the inside. The tires are not balanced correctly as my wheels shake when I go over 60 mph. I took it back and had them re-balance them and they guy only did the front ones saying he wont do the back ones . I told him that when I rotate the tires and the back ones go to the front it will be the same. It is still shaking after they balanced it a second time. Terrible service. I would never take my car or truck here ever again and would not recommend anyone. Check you mag wheels for deep scratches if you get your tires installed at this place. I am going to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau against this business and maybe I should sue him for damaging my new mag wheel.<//text>< user_id>

Iv been to this place multiple times and the really these guys are just awesome. Amir helped me out every time I was there very knowledgeable and a funny guy. They sell new and used tires. I went in for used tires but he gave me such a good price for new tires that went with that and 19s are not cheap.

Highly recommend this place. And will send all my family and friends here. Thank you guys for your service. Oh yeah their customer service is just amazing, and they have a nice waiting area with water and everything.

Just brought my Jeep for a rotation and they got me in a out so quick, their fast and efficient.< /review>

Great costumer service! In and out in 15 minutes. Purchased a pre-owned tire, when I got home to notice a huge defective section of the tire, they charged me the difference from a preowned tire to a new tire and sent me home with a brand new tire. Will be coming back if I need too.</Review>

< Review>
Caliber Collision not only rocks, it RULES! The catalytic converter was stolen off our Prius and there was a 20 car wait for a new one from the dealer. Because my wife and I were only visiting in San Diego when this happened, Linda at Caliber was able to get us to the head of the line and managed to get the converter replaced in less than a weeks time, saving us some serious bucks in hotel expenses. And in addition, we were able to leave the Enterprise rental car at Caliber when we picked up our car, saving us the time and hassle of returning it to the rental company. Really outstanding, exemplary and phenomenal service. Suffice to say, I cannot recommend this shop enough!< /Review>

Luis took absolutely special care of my rig.  There was never any question about what was going on day in and day out.  Any issue with insurance he handled and gave me the update.  The love and care he put into my truck has made him part of my family.  Thank you brother and to all those who assisted.< /review>

Caliber Collision was amazing!  They worked on corrective repairs from another repair bodyshop botched attempt.   Caliber Collision were extremely patient while the insurance company worked out some issues and keeping me informed.  They did an amazing job and exceeded my expectations with their professionalism.  I recommend it for everyone because it important to choose a shop to that gets it right the first time.  The staff is amazing!< /Text>

<GmapID>0x80deaaebbd9039a1:0x47f3851cbb442095<//GmapID><Text>I just had recent experience last week Tuesday with this company. On October 6,I had got in accident which messed up just my whole passenger side as you can see in the pictures.That same day when I stepped in Caliber I was welcome and given good customers service by the receptionist and Mr. Luis. While they had my car Mr. Luis kept in touch very often.They also had  text message system that kept me with the latest update in which status my car was in.My car stayed with them week and two days after the day they originally told me.My car is odd color so the first painting they did Mr. Luis called me days before the original expected date I was going get my car saying he was not please how the color came out.I respected him for that too.He could had me pick my car up knowing the color did not match but he did not.I also had other paint damaged on my car not from the accident Caliber took care of that I did not asked them too.They even replace my lights too.:)I  thought that was nice of them where it save me time and money trying figure out how to get them repairs taking care of.I highly recommend this company! I want thank the whole staff for my recent experience with them.I am very pleased with my car and the service they provided.Shout to Mr. Luis again he was the one I interacted the most. Thank you for everything!<//Text></record>

I called a month ahead to schedule a 2-3 day bumper replacement. The bumper did not arrive until the second day the car was in the shop. On day 3 I received a call informing me the paint was peeling and the bumper had to be removed and repainted. I was told the car should be ready the next day. Day 4 I received no phone call and when I called the office my call was not returned. After a few mile walk to the shop Linda had said she called and left a message. My phone does not have voicemail. Day 5 I received not call and had to walk back to to find out my car would hopefully done by the end of the day. Restore the rhythm of your life by avoiding Caliber.</Text>< Pics>

Truly exceptional customer service. They are timely, communicative, and friendly. Plus, they do great work...over the top quality, really, even when they don't need to. They really do just go that extra mile.</review>

The ladies in the office were great and maybe this would have been a 5star if i worked with them from the beginning. Instead i worked with Luis who honestly didn't care about me just wanted to get the car in and out.
Unfortunately my car came out of this shop missing push pin in my bumper and making rattling noise under the car. Thank God for my dash-cam! I was able to find that the lift system they used completely knocked my exhaust system off the hookers. It took me 24hrs to figured out the issue but it shouldn't have been an issue at all.  The Manager Wendi was very nice and understanding when i told her i just don't trust there work after finding this issue.

This repair shop is not for tuner or modded cars!!</review>

Brought my car in because I was rear ended on the freeway, and Junior took great care of me! The entire process was explained clearly and thoroughly, the repairs went great, and my car came back looking brand new! In addition, the front office was clean, organized, and had wonderful customer service - providing snacks and beverages for waiting customers. Seriously nothing but great things to say about this place; I definitely recommend.< /text>

Brought in my Camry to have front  right head lamp  replaced due to a faulty one the first time it was installed. The whole process was painless and quick. Luis Hernandez  and Wendi Lopez from the Bay Park location went above and beyond, also Andrew from the Mira Mesa location went above and beyond. I would recommend their services to anyone. Thank you.</review>

Caliber Collision was the recommended shop through Geico following my accident. From the moment I arrived till my car was completed, the staff at Caliber have been amazing. I received weekly updates on the status of repairs. My insurance covered a rental for 30 days. I was rear-ended and I was worried about structural damage which was identified on their assessment too so the car took longer than initially expected but Caliber covered the additional days because it took longer than their initial estimated time. Jr was my point person there and he did a great job of keeping me in the loop and addressed any concerns I had. Even after my repairs were completed, I thought maybe the alignment was a little off so they took care of that too and provided me with a rental. The level of service was stellar throughout the whole process and I would recommend their services to anyone without hesitation. My car looks and drives just like before the accident. I hope I don't require their services again in the future, but if I do, I will definitely come back to Caliber Collision.

I only have comparison for repairs like this one other time. I had only been in one accident prior to this and I had my repairs done through a dealership at that time and my experience was very different there. At the dealership, my repairs took longer without covering the additional time and the repairs at that time did not look as seamless as the job that Caliber did.< /Text>

After being in an accident I came to Caliber Collision for the needed repairs. From the moment I first stepped in the doors I was treated with nothing but cheerful smiles and respect. Long story short, my insurance covered everything and CC worked with them great. I worked with Mike mostly and he took care of me and all my questions! When I got the car back it looked immaculate, both inside and out! They washed and waxed the whole exterior and cleaned the whole interior. Definitely choose CC for your next body shop.< /text>

this place has a pretty good rating so my husband and I decided to try it out. It was edible, but I wouldnt go there again. I had carnitas and my husband had lingua. The carnitas had no flavor and was VERY fatty. The lingua was better, but nothing special. It cost $21 for nachos and a burrito so it wasnt that cheap. There many places in Bakersfield that are better and cheaper.< /Text>

I like the food very much. You get good sized portions and the food is good. It's always consistent even when I noticed it's the other cook filling in for the main Chef. Guess he needs a day off once in a while. Lol. I recommend the place.

If you need a professional fade and cut, look no further!! Ben is highly skilled and trained... I won't let anyone else cut my hair.

Ben was my old barber for 5 years back when I lived in San Jose pre-pandemic times. I didn't know he had moved his shop to Millbrae until I searched for a new barber locally. Such a relief that he is now only 10 mins away from me!

Most importantly COVID safe and clean!< /text>

Women can get a great haircut from a Barber!  Ben is amazing!  I needed my bias cut bob haircut cleaned up since it had grown out, and to be honest with you, Ben did a better job than my hairdresser and it was very affordable!<//text>

<Review>Highly recommended to anyone who wants a barber with substance! It's not easy finding a good barber nowadays and I just got lucky with Ben! He does amazing work!  I appreciate the time detail and skill Benny puts in, nothing feels rushed ever! Besides that, it's a very clean professional atmosphere and plenty of parking. I won't trust anyone else with my haircuts. Thanks Ben!< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Ben gave me my favorite haircut I've ever had.

I don't think I have found one person until now that can cut my hair the way I want. I showed him a picture of a blade used to cut hair, and I asked him if he used something like that.  I recently found out about this type of tool used to cut hair.  Most of the time I try a new barber, the first thing they would say is that my hair is so thick.  Then they would use cutting shears like crazy to try to thin it out.  I told Ben about this, and he gets me completely.  He explained to me that they do this to try to fix the mistake they did to my hair, and it just makes it worse.

Ben was very confident cutting my hair, and he even mentioned that my hair had a "feather" look to it from the back.  He listens to what you want and don't want, and tries to  give you the exact haircut you want the way you want.

I would recommend the "Broadway Barber Shop" to everyone, and hope more people see Ben for a haircut.  He is very friendly and cares about what he does.  My girlfriend also really loves the haircut he gave me as well, so I know for sure it was a good cut.</Review>

I have been getting haircuts from Binh for the past year now and feel like I finally found the Barber for me. I had seriously not had a good barber in probably 15 years. Great haircuts. Very detailed. Doesn’t miss a thing. The man knows his craft well. You won’t be disappointed. Price is fair.. Very accommodating. Nice relaxing old school barber shop kind of atmosphere. I highly recommend.</text>

<review>Ben just gave me the best haircut ever. This is my second time coming here. The first time I got a cut here was a year ago, it was rushed and too expensive. Ben is new to this location and offers a very competitive rate. I would argue its the best $30 haircut in the area. He is professional, makes great suggestions, and pays close attention to details. I recommend going in the morning when its not busy so he can take his time.<//review>< Resp>

<text>I met Ben a few months ago—after my longtime barber retired—at the Burlingame shop he was then working at;  he has now realized his dream of running his own shop in Millbrae.

Ben does an excellent job on my hair and is very detailed.  I recommend him highly.  Broadway has free 1-hr parking + a free lot around the corner, although I haven’t had a problem finding a spot on his block.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I've been looking for a new barber since my old one moved away. I've tried a couple of new places but was not happy. Still searching, I came across Broadway Barber Shop. After reading some of the latest reviews and responses, I gave it a try. I'm glad I did. Ben is professional, and his 25 years of experience shows with the haircut he gave me. I highly recommend Ben at Broadway Barber Shop for his professionalism, quality, and value. Thanks, Ben!

<Text>I have been going to Broadway Barber shop for 18 years. I was at first disappointed that John decided to retire after Josh sold the shop. Ben has cut my hair twice now and it looks great! Ben is only the 4th barber iI have had in my life. I plan on having cut my hair until the next turn of events. Long story short --- Go see Ben you will be very happy with his hair cut.

<text>I used to go to a “salon” in SF, I would have to deal with traffic, parking , meters etc , what a pain for over 25 years. My guy was worth the effort and trouble until one day I decided it’s too much of an effort. I went to the City and the same salon because I’m particular and very picky about my hair and how detailed the cut is. One night  walking down Broadway in Millbrae and seeing the barbershop on Broadway with the new owner cleaning the glass I was intrigued with who was taking over the shop. The barbershop that was there before did not seem welcoming or friendly and seemed as though you had tor belong to the boys club. When I saw a new owner outside cleaning the window one night we struck up a conversation and turned out Ben was the new owner of the shop. Always looking to support local and welcoming businesses in Millbrae I decided to  give this new barbershop a try. Oh my God ! Ben,who has over 25 years experience is awesome. He is skilled with clippers, scissors, straight edge and more, He will ask you what you want and like but if you’re not sure leave it to him and he will give you his recommendation. I left it up to him and he was on point ! He made a suggestion which made total sense and what I was like for in a newer style. His skills and technique are on point. I am so pleased with his work I look forward to going back every 3 weeks to get tightened up. I don’t write reviews at all but if you want a fresh cut you have to give Ben a try , you will not be disappointed guaranteed. Ben , welcome to Millbrae!<//text>< pics>

I like the haircut and it stays looking good longer than other places.  It's also the only place I get my hair cut without my wife complaining about it.  Nice guys and interesting banter.</Review>

This barbershop has the worst service ever. Going here and getting your haircut is like committing suicide to your hair. If it was possible to give this place 0 stars then I would. They treat customers with no respect & force you to pay for a cut after they have messed up.<//Text>

Horrible 55$ for two hair cuts for boys. And one has a ponytail so it's not like she cut and styled.<//Review>

This was a very positive experience for me. I found the perfect mattress and 2 pillows within the first 20 min or so the store was nice and clean and not full of people, but the best part of it was the salesman Ron! Ron is awesome! He is very friendly, not pushy and knows his stuff. He is just a sweet gentleman who, if I ever need another mattress I am going directly to!</Text>

I haven’t received the bed as yet but the sales process has been very smooth.  Christian was very helpful, personable and knowledgeable while helping me find what I hope will be just the new mattress I need.  I found a mattress style I liked at another store that Mattress Firm did not have on their showroom floor but Christian and his associate David found it for me in their inventory and did better than a price match.  I checked many stores and they were all more expensive than Mattress Firm in the end (adjustable bed frame, delivery and no requirement to purchase their mattress protector). The overall experience was very positive and I recommend them and Christian and David to anyone looking for a new mattress.<//review>

<Text>We had a great experience at Mattress Firm Cathedral City! My husband and I did not expect to buy a new mattress, even though we needed one. We just wanted to lay on some beds to get an idea of what works for us. Ralph Robles was the perfect person to help and guide us through this process! We had our kids and they were able to play while we looked. Everything was clean inside and we felt comfortable. Ralph was nice, helpful, knowledgeable, professional, and provided good customer service! We found the perfect Beauty Rest Pressure Smart Lux Pillow Top mattress and we look forward to it being delivered in a few days. This mattress has Pressure Smart Gel Memory foam to reduce tossing and turning, Pressure Smart Pillow Top for comfort premium support, and Infini Cool Surface for cooling technology to keep fresh at an ideal temperature. We would buy from Mattress Firm Cathedral City again. Thank you!<//Text><username>Nalani Fredericksen< /username>< Response>

Customer service with Mattress firm is always excellent.  From initially shopping, purchasing, and upgrading my mattress, David and the team at Mattress Firm have always gone above and beyond.  They are very kind in finding solutions that fit your needs, including price.  They don't try to up-sell you, they simply try to find what works best for you.  I definitely would recommend.</text>

Went looking for a memory foam pillow. Tried 4 of them. My favorite was a discontinued model. I was offered the display for 60% off. The attendant was curtious and mindful. I was pleased.</text>

We love this place. Finding a mattress that both my wife and I liked proved to be a great challenge. We decided that we wanted a Purple number 3.  After 2 months, neither one of us were sleeping well and it was only getting worse. Since the mattress came with a 100 day  satisfaction guarantee, we decided to return the mattress. Tristan, the store manager, didn't even blink an eye when we asked to return the mattress. He was more than accommodating. I highly recommend Mattress Firm.< /Text>

<Text>Left the store knowing SO MUCH about the different types of mattresses. It's weird to use the word "educational," but that's what our experience was Tristan is incredibly knowledgable about the various types of offerings out there-- A LOT--and had us try out all of them until we found the one that best suited our needs. There was no heavy sales pitch at all. A really fun (again,, not a word I would typically use about mattress shopping) expeerience.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80db0333314a07e1:0x11802cd80087b275<//Gmap_id></record>

We worked with Kyle, and he answered all of our questions and helped us to make a decision about which mattress to choose. He listened to us and did not try to pressure us in any way. We were very happy with our experience at Mattress Firm, and will be happy to recommend this dealership to our friends.<//Text>

<Review>I walked in looking to try a Nectar bed , they didn't have it on the showroom floor, which is normal for this mattress stores. I asked him to show me something comparable,  I ended up purchasing the instore mattress and for half the price. It.was great i checked out right away and set up delivery for a day that worked for me. Score! Can't wait to sleep on my new bed!!< /Review><date>1613354715258<//date>< Pictures>

Walked in and was quickly greeted by David. He was so nice, and helpful and most of all patient with my silly questions and me wanting to feel the difference of each bed more than once. The showroom  was clean and had lots of options. He helped me find and buy a bed and had delivery almost next day! David's customer service really made me feel confident in my purchase and wanted to thank him again for his time spent working with me on my sleep journey!<//text>

Today we were only able to order our bed So I cannot leave a review regarding how comfortable the bed is or how functional or how it helps us both health wise., we’re both convinced that it’s gonna be great or we would definitely not have made the investment.
The best part of this expensive day was meeting with Ron Silensky.  Ron was one of the most pleasant sales people I’ve come into contact with. He spent a great deal of time with us and we enjoyed every minute of it.Should you need a bed go to mattress firm and make sure and ask for Ron you won’t be sorry!<//text>

I am so pleased with the whole experience from the moment I walked in the door. Zachariah was awesome. He actually listen to what I was looking for and didn't try to sell me something that I didn't want to buy. They had the Serta I Comfort bed I wanted and at a good price. Would I recommend this story, my answer is yes. Thank you Mattress Firm for my new Mattress.<//Review>

My wife and I decided to stop by because we weren't too happy with our current bed. When came in we met Ron and he was fantatic, we told him what we didn't like about the mattress we have now and what we thought we might be looking for. He absolutely gave us the gold star treatment,  he was very knowledgeable and made sure to take as much time with us to find us what we think might be the perfect bed for us.
Thank you Ron!!< /text>

<Review>I visited the store with the intention to try out the purple beds and buy them on purple website. Once I came to the store Zach was incredibly helpful explaining to me all the differences between the different models and what types of beds work best for different sleep positions. He came off as very honest and genuine in his suggestions and I never felt pressured into purchasing anything specific. He was able to match all the deals purple was offering me online and even did one better by giving me a better pillow and being super accommodating with the shipping. I didn't expect to buy my mattress from mattress firm but I was so happy with my experience in store that I chose them over buying online from purple.</Review>< UserId.>

<review>My wife and I decided to stop by because we weren't too happy with our current bed. When came in we met Ron and he was fantatic, we told him what we didn't like about the mattress we have now and what we thought we might be looking for. He absolutely gave us the gold star treatment,  he was very knowledgeable and made sure to take as much time with us to find us what we think might be the perfect bed for us.
Thank you Ron!!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Alex Sublett</username><gmap_id>0x80db0333314a07e1:0x11802cd80087b275< /gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

The representatives in the store were very helpful in taking their time to show and explain every product. They made it easy to understand the best options and fit by encouraging taking the time to explore the comfort of various pillows, mattresses, and adjustable bases.<//Text>

<text>My experience wasn't the greatest since I ordered online and my bed never arrived. Wasn't able to get help over the phone and the website. I went to the closest mattress firm location and they corrected the issue and went above my expectations.

I recommended purchasing from the store so you can see the product and ask any questions.</text>< Date>

Technology is making mattress purchase and delivery very easy. I texted mattress firm and spoke to a wonderful gentleman who helped me purchase a mattress over the phone, and even helped me to have it delivered the next day. Sadly the mattress I’d hoped to purchase wasn’t in stock but I think I got a quality purchase. If not I’ll let y’all know!< /Review>

Honestly there are like 6257 mattress brands out there and I didn’t want the ship open the box and try it out so we went to Mattress firm in Cathedral City. The gentlemen and Manager Caitlin were super nice and we’re able to help us make a choice. We got the Purple3 they only have them to try at that location in our desert thus far. Also the delivery was great they set up our adjustable base and everything. Overall great experience and I would recommended them.< /review>< Pics>

David was AMAZING! Answered all of my many many questions, hauled mattresses back and forth for me to see, gave me time to think and make a decision... I didnt feel pressured, and I felt so good about what I chose because of his guidance and knowledge. And from a COVID standpoint, this company has it on point. I felt safe, there was sanitizing station, lobby not full, even allows you to pay using web links so you keep your security safe and dont have to share all of the touched pens, paper, etc. Would DEFINITELY buy here again!!</text>

Excellent experience. Zach was very knowledgeable and not 'hard sell'. Just wanted to make sure we got what was perfect for us. We came in looking for a specific mattress, reviewed that as well as others, and then went away with exactly what we wanted.< /review>

<Text>David Brellis was an excellent sales person. I walked in Matress Firm expecting a long experience. David came right up to me and was very educated and asked me all the right questions and guided me to the exact mattress I was looking for. He gave me several options to choose from in the price range I was looking for. His knowledge was so impressive that I learned a lot. I am so happy and excited to get my new mattress. I can't wait to get a good nights sleep without back problems. Thank you David!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< review>
We shopped several mattress stores in the search for our new bed. We came back to Mattress Firm because of the amazing value and customer oriented experience we found here.  The decision of buying a new bed is not one to be taken lightly or with the expectation of being a speedy process. In spending time with you, the manager and staff are ensuring the right mattress goes home with you!  Expect to spend some time on the decision process...you’ll be spending 1/3 of the next several years on what you buy!  We had a lovely experience and cannot wait to sleep on our new bed when it arrives!  Thank you Ron and Caitlin!<//review>

<review>I cannot say enough about this experience. I took my mom to get her a new mattress for the first time in ages and we were fortunate enough to get Zech as an associate. He was not only informative, he was kind, patient and so attentive to dialing into the level of comfort and firmness my mom was seeking. He made suggestions based on her feedback and ended up pleasantly surprising her with the mattress she ultimately ended up buying. We weren't sure intitially and were candid about wanting to check out other options before we committed, so Zech even did us the service of recommending other showrooms where we might find additional options. That kind of salesmanship is so rare and it gave us the confidence to come back after looking around because, simply put, his level of service was so unparalleled that we were excited to give him our business. What a legend, and what a smoothe and easy shopping experience. He also offered that if we need anything in the future to just call him directly for any bed needs - wow! We will definitely be calling him exclusively<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1590695467358, 'text': 'Thank you so much Natasha.

<Review>After years of boxed beds, we decided that a Tempur-Pedic was what we needed.  With so many options to choose from, it was nice to have a sales associate who was very knowledgeable about all the models and waited patiently while we tried each one, a number of times.  Thank you Zech for finding us the perfect bed for our sleeping habits.<//Review>< UserId.>

<gmap_id>0x80db0333314a07e1:0x11802cd80087b275<//gmap_id><text>I’m changing my review to an awful experience. The store experience was fine and Caitlyn was efficient and helpful but that’s where the positive experience ends. I will never buy from mattress firm again. First day my mattress was due for delivery it was delayed til three hours outside of the time window I was given only not to arrive at all that day. The gentleman at the store when I called said he’d have management issue me a credit for the delay and issues I came across. When it came to the day my mattress was arriving again it was delayed until outside of its time window again but arrived late. I still have yet to hear from the store management team or receive any kind of credit for my experience. My suggestion would be to shop anywhere but Mattress Firm in the Coachella Valley.< /text>< Rating>

< Review>
The gentleman that runs the store is very nice and helpful. Was able to buy a floor model for a really killer price. Enjoyed the experience here, some mattress stores feel like you're at a car dealership and that's uncomfortable and not enjoyable but that wasn't the case here. Would recommend this place for sure.<//Review>

Mattress Firm was our first stop in looking for 2 sets for our daughters. Caitlin Crist was friendly, informative & super helpful. However, we wanted to shop around before we purchased. We ended returning that same night after visiting 2 other competitors and made our purchase with Justan Bird. No one could beat the price & Justan was just as nice & helpful as Caitlin. He took care of us & even made several calls for a few special requests. We will definitely be back to this location for our mattress needs. Thanks Caitlin & Justan!!!<//text>

I write a fair amount of reviews but this one is a bit more special.. I went out to Palm Springs to spend a few days with my mom. We were eating breakfast and I noticed she was sitting a bit odd. When I asked about why, she mentioned that her upper and lower back were sore..  I immediately checked the date on her mattress and it was very old. So right after breakfast I took her to buy a new mattress...  I thought for sure that it was going to be many hours and many mattress stores to find the right one for her... Thank God we went into Mattress Firm. We were greeted warmly by Ron, and I don't think I have ever encountered a more enthusiastic, genuine and patient sales associate IN MY LIFE.. My mom, at 89, is not the easiest person to deal with, she labors forever just to pick out crackers for a dinner party, so I knew that picking out a new mattress would require a sales associate with special skill... Ron spent over an hour with her and was lazer focussed as my mom detailed all her requirements. I have to tell you that I was amazed at Ron's ability, truly amazed...  He spent an hour and a 1/2 with her  Trying bed after bed. When they were done Ron had sound her just the right mattress. She has had it several weeks now and her back pain is completely gone and she gleefully talks about getting a great night sleep every night...  If you are on the lookout for a new mattress I can emphatically tell you you're not going to find any better place with any better sales associate. Ask Ron to help you and you'll be amazed< /Text>

My boyfriend and I started mattress shopping the other day with nothing but dread. Thank god we chose to go into Mattress Firm first. We spoke with the manager, a super enthusiastic man who said his name was Zach, and was in and out in less than an hour. He knew exactly the right questions to ask, and the first mattress he showed us was the one we decided to go with. We walked out of there with a brand new mattress that was delivered the next day and didn't pay a dime! If you're looking for a new mattress and you're on a tight budget or time frame like we were, definitely give Mattress Firm a try before you go anywhere else. You won't regret it!< /Review>

< Review>
I ordered this spot as delivery a while back and thought it was exceptional. Made a promise to myself I'd go visit it in the flesh. Well, it wasn't so good live. Also, quite overpriced. You can get all these dishes for a tastier fare in NoHo. But hey, I live in this area so authentic asian isn't exactly available so this comes kinda close so I understand the price bump. My chicken over rice was a HUGE disappointment. The chicken should be tender and not dry. Shouldn't taste like trader joe's "just chicken". The duck rice at $16 was ridiculous. They must know what a rip off and how far they veered off from the tradition of duck rice. I'm really sad about that. Wonton soup was ok. very basic, Slightly over salty. Coconut ice cream, I didn't like at first but the more I ate it the more addicted I got. Very icy, but refreshing. Chicken wings, and I love chicken wings... I had one and was over.

Meh - if i come here again I'd just go for basic Thai dishes because all the authentic stuff they fake out and don't really hit that LEGIT mark.</Review>

If you're in the mood for the best Thai food then this is your place!
Lucky for me this restaurant is less than 5 minutes from my house. It's usually the busiest around lunch time since they have happy hour deals as well. But I came here around 7pm for dinner. The place is under new management and they have cleaned up very nicely and the staff is very friendly.
Right off the bat I ordered a Thai tea milk drink with boba added. They brought that out very quickly and it was so so delicious!! The boba was fresh and soft
Next I decided to get the coconut shrimp soup which is called Tom Kah Goong Shrimp Soup, the Exotic Thai Fried Rice and Pad See Ew which is cooked with wide flat rice noddle. All three entrees came out together and they all looked incredible. I started with the Tom Kah Goong. It had a small flame underneath to keep the soup warm. It was so delicious!! My god that ginger taste and the shrimp cooked perfectly and it was coconuty. It was out of this world good. Next, the fried rice was cooked deliciously. The small Chinese sausage inside gave a nice texture and flavor. Loved it! Lastly, the Pad See Ew was also delicious. The peanut sauce and the veggies were perfectly cooked together and created a very delicious aroma.
Over all I loved it here. I now know what the hype is all about. We will be ordering from them a lot more now.
P.S. they do a lot of take out orders which is a huge plus</review>

We order delivery most of the time, but we've also done take out and dine in. Every meal we've gotten here has been delicious, and the service when in the restaurant (takeout or dine in) has also been great. I love that I can order dishes with soy "meat" as it gives me even more options. I would  (and have) recommend Exotic Thai to anyone looking for great tasting thai food.<//Review>

Veg. Egg Rolls - mushy inside, but nice and crispy outside. Sauce was nice
Overall, I would not order again.</review>< time>

5 stars, fantastic service, and fantastic food.  I have been a long time customer and only recently discovered my favorite dish to be their tum yum pho.  The broth is delcious and filled with flavor, and the noodles are cooked to perfection.  Would reccomend for anybody who loves thai food.</text>

Great little Thai Restaurant in Burbank. My wife and I went there for dinner and really enjoyed it. They have such a varied menu it's hard to pick, but I really enjoyed my dinner. They also make awesome Bangkok rolls!!< /Review>

<Text>I liked their page on Facebook for the free can of Coke, but after I picked up my to-go order I realized it was 1/2 of the amount of food I usually get when ordering Thai. It was good, but it was not REALLY good nor worth the price ($10.50 is about their cheapest dish). All in all, I will find another Thai place to go to, but if it was my only option in the area... I think I would go again.< /Text>< Pics>

Great food but a bit on the expensive side. Small portions. But it compensates it with great atmosphere and friendly service. But best of all, beer! and beer specials are available.< /text>

A strip mall eatery with a South-of-the-Boulevard attitude, skip this dive and save yourself some frustration.

Vicky was the culprit today. Her lack of customer service skills was absolutely appalling. For example, a 10 minute wait to take a to-go order when there is not a single person in the establishment is absolutely outrageous.

Vicky's’ mishandling of a question about their YELP promotion was the genesis of this BAD review:.

The Offer.

Prominently displayed behind the counter is an orange sign stating “Write us a review on Yelp...Free 4 crab rangoo or 4 fried tofu”. When I pointed and asked “what is a crab rangoo?” Vicky snapped 'That special is not for take out customers, dine in only.”

I decided to write them a review for them anyway.

To top it off they gave me a diet Pepsi, instead of a Coke (sacrilege!)  And finally, they forgot to give me they fried wonton we ordered. Not Cool!<//Text>

<text>Staff was friendly enough. Food was alright. Ordered the beef jerky with sticky rice, but they didn't bring it out at the same time so the beef had to sit in front of us while we waited... hungry. It sucked.<//text>< Rate>

OMG DELICIOUS! My new go to spot for Thai food in Burbank.

If you love Thai food don't let this place go on untried. The wife had the spicy eggplant with beef and I ordered the spicy Penang curry with chicken.

Got to say the flavor was amazing, can't say enough good things about how delicious it was. I was surprised it was so good and I can't wait to come back and try more dishes.

Not a lot of people enjoying this fabulous restaurant so our service was immediate. We ordered from the lunch special menu. Lunch special prices are $10 a plate. It comes with salad and egg roll white or brown rice. The rice is shaped like a heart which was a cute touch.

They have a happy hour from 4:00 to 7:00 with $3 beers. Designated parking in front street parking around the side.</text>

Lee was very professional and understanding with us after our daughters fender bender. Explained the entire process, took care of everything, including rental car return! Hopefully we won’t need to use them anytime soon but I will tell others to check them out! You won’t be disappointed.<//text>

Prestige Bodyworks is a fantastic body shop. Everyone I spoke to was friendly and professional. They were able to resolve my insurance claim, from estimate to completion, within 5 business days. My car looks like new again. Will ABSOLUTELY recommend to friends/family. Thanks Prestige!<//Text>

<Text>Hands down the BEST autobody shop. Great repairs, you can’t tell at all where the damage was. They have a great quality team. Communication and customer service was great. Not one negative thing to say about our experience. This is the second time we have used them and will continue to use this quality business in the future. We are very pleased with the work.<//Text><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

The best body shop I've ever used. Clean, up-front pricing, owners were friendly and they got the job done quickly and on time.
Couldn't be happier. Highly recommend them!</review>

<review>How many ways can one unqualified state that Daryl, Jamie & Lee consistently provide the BEST repair service in my life. Let’s put in into context. As a career Navy test pilot, the Prestiege maintenance experience combined with USAA, is the most professional I have ever had on or off a flight line.< /review><gmap_id>0x80e84cecd1b2511b:0x1b4f746ae94d0449< /gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate><Name>Paul Heron< /Name><Date>1620139885770< /Date>< response>

<Text>Lee and his team got right on my car, interacted seamlessly with my insurance, kept me up to date on progress, and delivered my car right on time. It looks great and they even touched up a couple other little dings I had accumulated. I highly recommend them.<//Text><date>1606774774994<//date><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

My truck got rear ended. USAA had this shop on their site as recommended and they had great reviews from Google. The shop looked pretty nice, I spoke to the receptionist on the phone before I arrived and she was very professional. They gave me a call two days after I dropped it off with an estimate and when the vehicle would be available. They have some type of partnership with Enterprise rent a car so that was convenient. I got my vehicle back a day earlier than expected and the quality of work looks great. Highly recommend.< /review>

<Review>Around here there are many body shops to choose from, but there are many things that sets this shop above the others. It's ran by a person that has had a passion for cars since he was young. They've been in business for over 20 years, and they have never comprised their customer satisfaction. I was not at fault in accident and they went above and beyond my expectations. 11/10 would recommend to anyone.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1546629475229, 'text': 'Good morning  I would be more than happy to help you  if you could give me a call , I need more information from you , your Name claim number and insurance company so I can further assist you  Lee Prestige Bodyworks operations manager .'}< /Response><gmapID>0x80e84cecd1b2511b:0x1b4f746ae94d0449</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My wife's car sat at the body shop completed for three whole days, finally I called to ask about the progress, but by the time I found out that her car was ready it was too late in the day to make arrangements to pick it up.  This was a Friday, so her car sat there until Monday (another 2 days).  Had to pay for the rental out of pocket for the days past the completion date.</Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I am very disappointed with this place it was my first time eating here and it was my birthday too. let me start off with poor service the guy server was rude has no manners and didn't take us as customers serious he tried skipping us in line thinking we didn't know Spanish. We waited 45 for simple plates when the other customers that came after us got there food first and they had more food then what we ordered. We sat outside in patio watching others eat and didn't even have our drinks. Not sure how this restaurant is still open. The food was not worth the wait I wish I could give the -10 rating never going back. The only reason we came here was because the other place we go to was closed BiBi's Honduras restaurant please take your business there they have better service, food and Tortillas come with meal un like this place. One more thing meat is over salted.< /Text>< pictures>

Everything truly tasted fresh and homemade; such simple flavors but they all work incredibly well together. There wasn't one component I didn't enjoy. This will definitely become a go-to for those laziest of nights. One of the best meals I've had in a long time!</Text>

<text>They got a nice special baleadas for $1.25 but the best part is they can add asada or chorizo for a little extra and the flour tortillas are hand made . If you are around HP and want to get something quick stop by.<//text><resp>None<//resp>< Rate>

Nosotros ordenamos tajaditas con carne molida y cebolla en curtido. También ordenamos la especial de 6 baleadas por $1.25 cada una. Todo estuvo muy delicioso. Un poco caro por las tajaditas pero no estamos en Honduras entonces "it's worth the price" lol.

We got the plantain chips with ground beef and Honduran sauce with the pink pickled onions (super yum). We also ordered the special of the day that was 6 baleadas for $1.25 each which is a deal bc normal price one is $2.99. the tajaditas are a bit pricey if you compare to how much they cost in Honduras but since we out here in Cali it's definitely worth the price. Overall I'm a happy catracha and I love coming here. Family has been coming since they first opened and now I bring my friends as an adult. Woa character growth.<//text>

Awsome place great food and good service my favorite are the enchiladas and baleadas so yummy.

<text>I feel like the food could be too expensive for a simple baliana $3.50  The 5 pound of flour Is less than 5 bucks. Unfortunately we do not have no good Honduras restaurants   to represent us.

<review>They have a live MC, parking is a bit tough and so is the neighborhood. The food was ok and the baliadas are extremely small. No to mention how expensive the food was. My hunt for the perfect baliadas continues.</review>< Pictures>

The baliadas were pure beans with drops of crema they forgot to put cheese. I asked for some with avacados and they were rotten so I didn't enjoy them at all. The service was horrible had to ask for everything won't be returning at all. Now my stomach is acting up.</review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>This is the worst place ever. The food is utterly disgusting and badly prepare. Their service is the worst. The owner of this "restaurant" was called when we came to return our food and he told us yelling not to come back and that he didnt want our business when we simply requested them to remake the food. This is not only disturbing because hes the owner but the fact that they tried to put it on me because I said I wanted the food well done as the previous time I ordered, it was raw!! I am so disappointed and frankly quite angry because I also made this complaint on uber eats but they still allow poor quality food to be given to us.<//Text>< pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I could've easily robbed this place. I went in and no one was at the front. The lady was in the back talking. I tried making noise. After a couple of minutes i finally called her a few times. Still went unnoticed. at least 7 minutes in all. Then the food arrived, worst chicken ever! It looked spoiled, not fully cooked, and well actually just seemed microwaved for a minute. Warm on the outside, cold in the inside. I took a bite or two before throwing the whole thing to the trash. Waste of time and money. At least the lady was nice. But only being nice doesn't cut it in the food industry. That chicken, raw and old the way it was could send someone to the hospital. How's that for an expensive meal.< /Review>< pics>

Service is the worst,  long waiting for the food, and when arrived food isn't that good.

Baliadas ARE a must and bomb. TAJADAS ARE also delicious and comfort food. The natural drinks are tasty. They have a special. You need to ask.</Review>

<Review>This place is so lit let me tell you. One time we were here and this lady starts putting money into this guys clothes (he was singing) but then her boy friend starts getting mad and It looks like they're about to fight but they don't and the couple starts drinking more (like they downed some beers together #relationshipgoals) and everything was cool. Also food.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2c91ffcfd99d1:0x1925219edb74f315</GmapID></record>

Horrible food and the service is a little good.
The restaurant has dirty floor and has flies.

I think the price is irrelevant when the food is good and the service better, but everything is "0".<//review>

This restaurant is one of the worst ones I've been to. They take more than an hour to bring your food. Even with the longest wait, the food is still raw. The workers have a horrible attitude. Don't eat here unless you want food poisoning.<//review>

The waitresses were nice but they messed up my order and expected me to take it the way it was. The kabobs meat was so tough! So hard too chew which made it un-enjoyable. It was food that you can honestly make at home. Not savory.  While eating the djs were sound checking and too loud. Honestly, not worth the price. We would have had better luck at a chillis lol. Weve been to the Vermont kitchen and that one has a better rating than this one in our opinion.<//text>

<Review>i really like this restaurant but the reason i am not giving it 5 stars is because i had a bad experience one time. It wasn't the food, but i bought a coupon on groupon for $11. This $11 coupon has a $22 worth at the restaurant. So i purchased 2 of them. The coupon said $22 because that's how much i payed. I gave that coupon to my husband as an early birthday present. We went to eat and i asked the waiter what can i get with this coupon he recommended we get the PARILLADA. So we got that with 2 drinks. The food was AMAZING. really yummy. i have no complaints about that. we got a little bit of everything on that parillada. if i remember correctly the bill came to be around $25-$30. Then he discounted $22. The coupon was suppose to discount double which is $44. I told him and he said sorry but the coupon says $22 ...you can talk to them if you have an issue. Later i found out it was my mistake and that u can only use one coupon per table. So his mistake actually gave me the real discount without his knowledge though. If the coupon said $11 he would of given me $11 instead of $22. I just think if your going to deal with groupon you should have your stuff together. Yes it was my mistake as well but he could of explained what groupon explained to me, but he had no idea the coupon was actually worth $22. Either then that the food and service is great. I recommend paying with cash or credit when you go and avoid the coupons.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service, I ordered slices with ground meat, and they brought it to me with chicken, and I told them they brought it to me again with the ground meat all cold and a dry meat, I will not come again, I do not recommend them, very bad experience. It's not worth paying so much for food SO that I eat it better.

(Original)
Muy mal servicio,ordene tajadas con carne molida, y me lo llevaron con pollo, y les dije me lo trajeron otra ves  ya con la carne molida todo frío y una carne reseca, no vuelvo a venir, no los recomiendo, muy mala experiencia. no vale la pena pagar tanto por comida ASI que yo la consino mejor.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service, the food is NOT good ... the waitress / cashier thinks she is the owner of the place and after serving the dishes she never comes back if you need anything else, and for that reason we ordered pupusas from the restaurant next door, we ate it there And for that if he went to tell us that we could not eat from another place to which I told him that we were already finishing and we were already leaving and he replied that he would not leave us for the next time, because hopefully I will be a message because there will NOT be another occasion Besides being very expensive, his food is ugly and miserable! Ahhh and they serve it cold, very bad experience ...

(Original)
Pésimo servicio, la comida NO está buena... la mesera/cajera se cree la dueña del lugar y después de servir los platillos nunca regresa si necesitas algo más, y por esa razón pedimos pupusas de el restaurant de a lado, la comimos ahí y para eso si fue a decirnos ke no podíamos comer de otro lugar a lo cual le dije ke pues ya estábamos terminando y ya nos hibamos y me respondió ke para la próxima no nos dejaría, pues ojalá les esté mensaje x ke NO habrá otra ocasión, además de ke esta carísimo esta fea su comida y miserable!!! Ahhh y la sirven fria muy mala experiencia...<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Very faithful to the Honduran flavor, but ask for extra slices because the ones that come on the plate are very few

(Original)
Muy fiel al sabor hondureño, pero pidan tajadas extras por que las que vienen en el plato son muy pocas< /Review>

(Translated by Google) We made an order through Uber Eats, we ordered 3 soups, 1 snail 1 tripe 1 man's soup, the 3 soups did not bring lemon, it did not bring slices, or tortillas the man's soup does not bring crab and the rice as it was a gift, they should be more responsible with the people who serve the food, thank you ....

(Original)
Hicimos un pedido por Uber Eats, pedimos 3 sopas, 1 de caracol 1 mondongo 1 sopa de hombre, las 3 sopas ninguna traía limón, no traía tajadas, ni tortillas la sopa de hombre no trae jaiba y el arroz como que era regalado, deberían ser más responsables con las personas que sirven la comida, gracias....< /Text>

I don't like to complain about the food but I will definitely not return to that place 👎
They are always wrong with the receipts and they charge you for others if you realize they return you and if you did not wash yourself 😩
Now I understand why almost no people arrive.

(Translated by Google) Honduras kitchen never go to this place bad service from the waitresses who do not look happy and order two baliadas that are better the Guerrero tortillas from the store than the ones they serve in this place also reheated chicken and hard slices that seemed from a day Before and worst, prices are very high for a very poorly cooked meal. Never go to eat at this place. Better go to the tacos in any corner. You will have a better time.

Never go to this place. Bad service from the waitresses, they don't look to happy themselves. Don’t order Dos Valiadas, Guerrero tortillas from the grocery store taste better than the one served at this place! Also the Pollo Reheated y Taradas Duras, they look they were made from the day before. The worst and high prices all round for very bad cooking food. Never go eat to this place, instead go the tacos from the corner stand.

<text>(Translated by Google) They lack better staff, because the people who attend are terrible, so they don't even want to go to eat at the restaurant, much less leave tips. They should pay more attention to that. They should also lower the prices a bit because they are very expensive or at least the sodas. But also there to say that the food is good, and it is the best restaurant for the baliadas, in the food if I recommend it 100% .. the staff have to work more and that is why I give 3 stars because the others very well.

And the slices with ground meat if 16 slices came and the fatty meat. Ripe plantain was 8 slices and the dishes are served in small plates to put tortillas. The maraculla is what they sell in for4les from A & 2 h to a dollar. When it is special to the owners, I hired good cooks who cook well. no quality

(Translated by Google) In my opinion about what I ate last night, I didn't like the food at all, it was ugly or not wanting to eat, they give it a chance and one is looking to eat rich, not an ugly meal, I know this because I am from my country Honduras if the pleasure of blessing fast food and to give something that is not good, the drink is the most expensive and e rightly taken, it was just the place, I just didn't like anything about what was sold to me and it was a chop in majinate the rest. Bye and excuse me but it is my opinion I do not usually do it but this kiss if half courage because I thought it was my country and they are very low from what they want

(Original)
En mi opinión sobre lo que comi anoche no me gusto para nada la comida estava fea ni ganas de comer le dan auno y uno busca comer rico no una comida fea se esto por que soy de mi pais Honduras si el placer de bender comida alo rapido y dar algo que no sirve esta mal la bebida es la mas cara que e tomado con razón estaba tan solo el lugar solo que no me gusto nada delo que me vendieron y era una chuleta en majinate lo demas. Bye y disculpen pero es mi opinión no suelo aserlo pero esta bes si medio coraje por pense que era mi pais y estan muy bajo desde lo que quieren< /Text>
